I have since done an enema, which didn't produce any big movement just 5 or 6 small hard pieces bigger than a gumball but smaller than a golfball. I don't feel particularly constipated, or don't feel any pain. 

But I've had an experience before 3 years ago where i had a massive turd after not pooping for a month or two (doing dope, it just didn't cross my mind) that was like giving birth. this doesn't feel anywhere like that, I can't tell if its because I'm back on opiates that I don't feel the pain of a potential blockage or am just afraid of the blockage so i haven't eaten much the past 3 or 4 days. drank calories and what not.

So i've started tonight taking dulcolax as it is not stimulant and will moisten the poo, as I stay especially hydrated. I really don't want to go to a dr just to be told to do an enema, and to have my opiate use come back to the forefront as my health issue. 

I have pain management figured out finally, slipped disc from high school football, but a social miscue got me back on opiates just cuz i was weak and didn't follow my program.

As opiate enthusiasts, a lot of us tend to use antihistamines either as potentiators or as antiemetics.

I'm the type of dopehead that somehow still gets physically sick from opiates, despite being 6 years into a daily opiate habit and despite recently coming from a 3bun/day 8 month long H run.

For those who have experience with both diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine (Vistaril), how would you compare the effects of the two? Do you find either one to be more effective in helping with opiate-induced nausea? Do you find either to be more or less sedating?

I'm trying to find an antihistamine with minimal drowsiness yet strong antiemetic properties and these are the two I have access to right now.

Does tolerance ever hit a wall or plateau, or does it just keep going up forever?","Say someone had an unlimited supply of super powerful opiates, and dedicated their whole life to doing as much as humanly possible without dying, and they were somehow blessed with unnaturally good health and long life.  Assuming a steady and regular intake and increase in dose of the drugs over the course of their life, if you were to plot out their tolerance on a graph, would it more likely be a straight diagonal, a curve, or an irregular shape? Or would it be impossible to say with any confidence?

My laymen understanding is that tolerance/dependence occurs because when you take opiates, it temporarily blocks nerve pathways that transmit pain, causing the body to compensate by making more pathways, which essentially makes everything more painful.  So it seems like if you could manage to live long enough, there would be a point where no more pathways could be created, and you would become Super Junkie.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I thought about posting to one of those pharmacology subs but they're pretty inactive.  I don't need an expert answer, just got curious and wondered if anyone could shed some light.

I've fallen out before but never woke up drenched in sweat and very weak and also couldn't think straight. So what I'm kind of wondering. is it this was an O.D. because at what I've read on here people say you don't remember anything. Also I have legitimately O.D.'d and had to be narcanned but I dont really remember that experience all that well. Was most definitely a scary experience both times and it seriously got me wondering why I'm stupid enough to continue doing dope.

I was in my last semester of college. i only needed one last class to graduate, but i took a full load so that i could continue to co-op and be paid instead of having to *look* for a job lol. So the class I needed for graduation was conversational latin - WHAT A BITCH

all the other classes were pretty much random - two were ""for fun"" and then my best friend in my major and i (now just my best friend altogether :) decided to take a senior level literature course. on henry james. mainly for scheduling reasons lol, but, turns out henry james fucking sucks

those were the most insanely boring reads of my entire academic career. i had never been so uninterested in learning. if there even were anything to learn from his weird, wanna-be modernist, completely depressing ""literature"" lmao. like ya henry james, we all know what its like to be in a cage. jesus

so, i was ballin HARD on the 80s. im talking 2, 3, even more sometimes/day. i dunno, fuck, i was doing alot haha. basically had enough money for rent and i dunno what i was doing for food..... seeems like i was smoking alot of weed instead of eating? i was slinging the herb so it was not costing me anything, as well as how i could afford so many $75 80s lol

so this dumbass class had the most boring subject as our author of study, and maybe the most boring person ive ever seen IRL as the professor. it was T/R, 9-10:45. you'd think it was 7 days/week from 4:30am-noon based on my attendance/tardiness. every class, we had to write a 3-5ish page essay response to whatever book we had been assigned. my friend lived down the block away from campus from me, so she'd come over around 7-8 those mornings and we would both get on our laptops, and bang out those essays. 75% of the time she would decide she hated what she wrote, and literally throw the shit away. i turned mine in every time. and we were taking 2 litre gravs of dankity west coast sticky the whole time lol. then we would hop out of my apartment and stroll over to class, just across the quad. some of my favorite mornings in life tbh

i never let her do any OC - not out of spite or selfishness, but because i knew how big my problem was and i didnt want her to taste the glory (tho im apparently a *very* respectable guy cuz after graduation it was only a few months before her dumbass boyfriend was feeding her OP20s and trying to drag her down with him)

one morning, we didnt give a FUCK.  we both hated our reading so badly we didnt even pretend to wanna write an essay, and instead of doing my ""normal"" morning wakeup line, i did a whole fucking 80 right before we left my house. it was fucking beautiful. we kinda cuddled on the walk there lol, and we busted in the door about 10 minutes late looking insane, and proclaiming we HAVE NO PROTOCOLS (what our professor called the daily essays). next thing i know, im getting elbowed in the ribs for *falling asleep on her and drooling/snoring). i was NODDING the fuck out haha. at 9am. on a tuesday. in a 400 level course at a respected school. 

i dont remember much, but i do remember this valuable lesson- if you want things to go your way in the south, be a pretty, charming girl with a nice rack. being a white protestant male doesnt mean shit anymore. we both went to see our professor (separately) after finals were over. while she had not turned in a single fucking paper the whole semester, she somehow talked him up to a C+ haha. and while i'd done every paper ever assigned, just fucked up on OC the entire semester, i talked my way up (or down?) to a fucking C- haha. only C i ever made in college...

Advice from people who tried it.,"Very long post about details of my usage the last paragraph is a summery so just reading that should be fine.

So I found out that there's a clinic within walking distance of the office I work at. I have a car but just saying its that close. So this is great because I was thinking or maybe going in at an odd time like 11 before lunch so I don't deal with lines. I go into work at 830 so I'm sure the likes wouldn't be that bad at 8 anyway vs 6 or 7 for the people working labor job seem to go out earlier. 

But I just went onto subs and quit dope. I was using a gram a day and I've been on opiates steady for about 2 years now. Even if I don't cop I have subs as a backup. Subs don't seem to help me.  They take down the cravings a little. I just relapsed tonight but I homestly must say I didn't NEED to cop this bun I just really really wanted to after being 10 days clean. 

Going from gram of dope a day to subs felt like when I went cold turkey from 100 mg of oxy. I can get through withdrawl always but I just can't do the bordom once im sober. Everything looks so grey and I always feel uncomfortable in my own skin. I struggle to look people in the eyes talking and I'm just not myself. I know it takes some time but I've gone a month before and 2 or 3 months after oxy and still struggle with these things.

When I do dope I don't like getting fucked up. I just always do enough to feel nice and have a pleasant buzz. I've heard methadone makes you feel nice in the beginning and stay opiated feeling. I think this would be perfect for me to slowly learn how to handle life while still having a slight comfort high that will slowly fade rather than dissapear right away like with subs. 

I'm smart enough to know to not chase the methadone high I'll get to my comfort dose then stay there before tapering off. My only concern is this place has a requirement of 2 years before taper process starts to happen. Also they made it sound like there was a lot of required meetings I have to attend there with might be hard of it later at night if right after work would be awesome. 

So I'm wondering how much do most places cost and how much work must I put into meetings and many of the places (I know all are different). This is my third failed Attempt at subs am I ready to try meth or is it still more Intense. They tried warning me that it's really a last resort for addicts but it sounds like it can really be a good option for me. 

Last thing. Will I be allowed to keep my scripts? Also my dr never found out I was on subs will he find about methadone? I'm on xanax only 0.5mg for night terrors that I slmetimes get and really need. I used to sometimes wake up screaming in the middle of night feeling like someone wanted to kill me. But even this low dose helped that that away. I'm also on adderall 2 30mg IR pills mostly to help motivate me to work and focus on studies. 

I know I wrote a lot but I wanted to share as much as I could to help you don't need to read it all likely. I'm just looking for people opinions on it good or bad I want to hear anything people can share about there experiences. 

Thanks a lot in advance for your help. 

 .
. 

To Summerize: Im looking for if its good in my case if you read my whole story but open to hearing others experience if you don't read all this. If I can keep my scripts of 0.5 mg xanax daily and adderall I could on suboxone. The cost of it for most people. I heard 10$ a dose do you pay extra for drug tests or the required meetings? I have required meeting to go to at the center not just NA on my own is this normal and if so how often are they for others. How does the meth feel and how long does the nice feel last. Finally I often have to redose much more than average person. Should I for sure be good to take with meth 1st a day I take subs twice if not three times a day. Dope I need to do every 4 hours. 

Thanks again for help. The last paragraph is really the most important but the rest could help a lot for me detail about my situation ",1450322887.0

I've got a friend that I met online with whom we share connects back-and-forth. I'm dirt poor, though, so I can only cop like once every week or two; dealers often forget I exist; but this friend cops multiple bundles a week – and is just a great customer to have. 

Relatively recently, I met an *excellent* new dealer that I thought – if I could put in touch with my friend, would make an awesome ""Christmas"" present for both parties.

Here's where it gets good: Both my friend and my dealer agreed to throw me some free shit for making the introduction, but neither told me beforehand how much it would be. Obviously, I'm not gonna complain about free dope; and so to try and maximize my potential high today, I met my dealer with $20. 

For that, he gave me 5 bags. Awesome. 

My friend, though... he was *so* grateful for the reliable new connect with good prices and even better dope – that he gave me a fucking *bundle*.

So that's how, for $20 and having SMS text conversations with two people, I got 15 bags of dope today.

TL,DR: If you've got friends and awesome dealers, be good to them! Don't be sneaky and try to ""game"" them and they might just treat you right right back.",1450303394.0

Okay, quick history of my drug use. Started like everyone else, round 14 or 15 yrs old, with da pain pills, and worked my way up. By the summer after graduating high school, at 18, that sweet needle was in my arm. Fast forward 2 years of hell on earth and I decided to get on suboxone.

I started subs on 16 mg a day, and stayed there for about 6 months. Got my head straight and decided to start the taper process. Honestly, I know people have beef with subs thinking its just substituing one addiction for another, which it definitely is, but it enables you to get your mind straight, and thats what I needed. After about 1 year and 6 months of tapering, than stressing out and going back up, tapering again, so on and so forth, I decided it was finally time to kick this shit. I'm a college student and work over the summers, so the only feasible time to kick with no obligations is right fucking now, over winter break, with my loving family.

I had discussed with my parents how I wanted off the subs, which they obviously were worried about. In their minds, subs could likley be the only thing keeping me on the right path, and thus alive. Hurts so fucking much thinking of the shit I put them through. But I know im ready, as long as I can get through it.

I'm kicking a 4mg a day sub habit. Once I started, I did a supppper fast taper. Going for as long as I possibly could before taking so little of the strip that I can't give an actual amount. I must state that I have the desire to quit, its just getting through the fucking wds. I know once i'm on the other side I can do it. Just gotta get there. Currently, it's friday, 10:22am, and the last time I dosed was tuesday morning with a small tiny tiny tiny tiny bit on early Wendesday evening. Honestly, right now, I don't feel terrible. just wanna cut my legs off. And fucking nighttime. Fuck nightime. Everything gets worse at nighttime.

HERE'S MY ACUTUAL QUESTION!

Alrighttttt, im dragging on with bulllshit because I gotta get some of this shit of my chest, yall know how it b. But heres my question. I know how people feel about kratom. I know how addictive it can be. But I also know how helpful it can be. I currently only using kratom when I reach what I've been calling ""Breaking points"". When shit gets so bad that if I wasn't with my parents at home, I'd cave and take some sub, and then feel like a piece of shit afterwards. In my mind though, Kratom is that substitute. So far, I have dosed once on kratom, last night at roughly 4am. Probably only took a few grams and also barfed most of it back up. Shits disgusting. But what do yall think? If using the kratom in this manner, probably once every night for 3-4 days to get some sleep and break up the harsh withdrawals, and then I wouldn't take it anymore. Is taking it really going to set back my withdrawls THAT much. If it really is that significant than fuck it I don't need it. its just that 2 hours of being able to sleep and break up the days is so fucking appealing, because that is exactly what fucked me when I tried quiting before. With a gram a day IV heroin addiction, I would not sleep a week for 6-7 days, and probably longer but I never got that far because the endless pain, disassosiation, anxiety and depression would break me in half, to where I'd do anything to get straight. 

Please let me know what you guys think. I've done plenty of research but its hard to know who to trust and who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about. I don't take advice from people who haven't gone through it. And I trust the reddit community, especailly yall. Hit me with your opinions.

EDIT: I must stress how im not using the kratom as a means to eliminate withdrawals. Im not taking it multiple times a day. I'm only taking a small dose at night to take of the edge and allow some sleep. That's it.",1450452947.0

We had broken up in January, and reconnected in April. We met for coffee, where I confessed to him that since our break-up I had started messing around with dope. To my surprise, he confessed the same. Whereas I had been shooting tar from the jump, he told me he had been ordering #4 off the darknet and snorting it. One thing leads to another and he ends up at my house that night, where I supervised his first shot of tar. A few days later, he proposes that we go in 50/50 on a gram of some super potent #4, some of the same that he had been insufflating. Fast-forward...we get the package in the mail on a Friday evening, and spend the next couple of days floating together in dope-fueled bliss. Things were great, they were beautiful, we loved each other as much as ever and now we were sharing a new experience, sharing our pain like we always had. For the 2 years we were together, we did all kinds of drugs. He was the computer-savvy one who would order anything under the sun as long as it offered a good kick, primarily rolly drugs and psychedelics. MXE, MDA, MDMA, 4-ACO-DMT, 25-b, 2c-b, etc... We scraped by the edge of life hand in hand more times than we could count and loved every second of it. Anyway. Saturday night, he goes home alone. I kiss him goodbye, tell him ""please be safe"" and he promises me...""you know me, I'm always safe"". Should have thought twice about that....there are lots of ""should haves"" to look back on. The next morning, he is not answering my calls or texts or Facebook messages. I call his roommate and ask him to go check on him. Roommate knocks, gets no answer, door is locked. He climbs through the window. Finds him in his bed, dead. The last time I had spoken to him was around midnight the night before. He overdosed sometime between then and 10am Sunday morning. 

His mother has since decided that I am the sole reason for his death. She believes I was there the night he died, shot him up, and fled when he overdosed. I always carry narcan on me, if I had been there, he would still be alive. She continues to publicly harass me on social media, putting me on blast all over Facebook, telling his 1,000+ friends that I am a murderer, that I killed her son and have no remorse. After he died, and she asked me what happened, I told her everything. I gave her complete honesty. She knows I was the first to put a needle in his arm. That seems to be the only piece of information she regards. Everything else is dust in the wind.

I feel on the verge of breaking...I know I fucked up, I made a mistake...Why it had to be a fatal one, I will never know. I don't deny anything that I have done. but I know I don't deserve this...we made our choices. I don't blame the one who gave me my first shot for the endless months of the pain of addiction I have put myself through.

not sure what I'm looking for here. maybe someone who has been through something similar. Or just someone to listen. I don't know. It hurts so goddamn bad. I loved him, I loved him a damn lot. I know he loved me too, and would be in such despair to see how things turned out. In the months after his death my use spiraled completely out of control, I went from using a couple of times a week to every day, all day, waking up in the middle of the night sick. Doing a little better now, but there remains a long road ahead.

I was so grateful when my sister showed me this app, I had finally found people who understand what I'm going through.
I've been shooting heroin since I was fifteen, which has been 19 years in March and I feel like I'm on the end of my rope. that the peace I would finally find with death overrides the promise I made my mom almost twenty years ago.
every morning I wake up with my stomach in knots, no matter how much dope I did before finally going to sleep I never wake up well. I'm wearing bout 5 or 6 pairs of leggings and sweat pants 2 long sleeve shirts and 2 hoodies and a skull cap but I'm still freezing cuz it's winter in Chicago and our heat barely world. I live on the top floor of a 3 flat on the west side of Chicago with my roommate and his cousin.
I'm a little white girl living in one of the most dangerous ghettos in Chicago. I've lived out here almost 17 years and know a lot of ppl so at least I'm not getting beat up, raped, or robbed anymore. people starting calling me ghost because when I was 16 I was so convinced I would be dead at 18 that I ran away to see the ocean before I died. well I haven't died and I've been bouncing from city to city every since. usually spending about six months in each city before ""disappearing,"" only to show back up a year or 2 later. I've met some amazing people.
I don't know how many times I've over dosed, been in the ICU, psych ward's, jails and rehabs. each one in multiple cities. I've done so many drugs, more drugs than most people know exist, probably more in a week than most addicts in months. I'm not bragging, it just is what it is. in my late teens, early twenties I had gotten into the music business and the drugs are truly limitless. 
I always had money, always had different hustles going, never worried about being sick unless I was in jail.
but now I'm almost 35, way older than I ever wanted to be. I have a fifteen year old daughter, the 9 months I was pregnant is the only sober time I've had since I was 13. 
I have nothing, I live in a trap apartment and everyday I have to go downtown to hustle the tourists. I stand on a street corner with a sign that says I need help getting home. ""my boyfriend beat me up and I'm stranded. Please help) I stand there and cry. it's embarrassing, degrading, and I take advantage of good hearted people. I hate myself. it'll be -3o degrees in Chicago with the wind, and I have to be out there begging until I make $114. that'll cover both mine and my roommates dope and smokes for the night x and my wake up. for some fucd up reason he has NO hustle ( except me) and I just do it cuz I have no where else to live.   
I only see my mom and daughter a few times a month because I never make enough money to be able to spend time doing ANYTHING but getting high and getting money to get high again. 
I'm always terrified I won't make enough money and I'll brr sick.
I never eat, I shoot up in my neck because I don't have even one other vein. 
I'm constantly running from something and towards death. but death ring take me and I don't know why. I've been there ssi many times but my body just won't give in.
this is no kind of way to live. there's nothing that I could learn in rehab that I haven't already learned in one of the 15+ times I've been.
I don't know what to do anymore.

Cheap, super effective with zero withdrawals that'll cost you $10-$15 total.","Whether you have a mild addiction or a $200 a day shooting habit, this will work wonders for you.

No more suffering, no more pain and misery and after the 3-5 day treatment you'll detox the opiates from your system. Yes, it is that good.

You'll restore your body and mind and finally be happy. Results work on day one.

This is an incredible protocol.

TL;DR - taking powdered Vitamin C in sodium ascorbate form with water and some honey to mask the unpleasant taste anywhere between 40-80 grams a day total depending on your daily habit will work wonders for you. It works for people who have a 30mg oxy or a $200 a day dope habit. It's only about $10 dollars at Wal Mart, Whole foods and Trader Joe's. No more suboxone, methadone or other opiate derivatives that will perpetuate the hellish withdrawals.

From the Introduction of First Australian Report http://www.whale.to/v/kalokerinos2.html

“On March 8th 1977, Dr Irwin Stone of the U.S.A. wrote to us and said, ""please drop me a line quickly and let me know if narcotic addiction is a serious problem in Australia. We have developed a non-toxic, detoxication procedure where we can take the addicts off heroin or methadone with no withdrawal symptoms. The addicts have no desire to return to the drug and if they do take a ""fix,"" it is like injecting plain water, the detoxication is so complete and rapid.”

What Dr. Stone is introducing is high dose Vitamin C. The small amount of Vitamin C, recommended by the RDA (75 mg then and 60 mg now) is enough to protect the person from gross disease (scurvy), but not the amount to maintain good health. I am a very healthy person and I take 10,000 mg of Sodium ascorbate per day along with a few other supplements and have zero negative side effects.

The article continues and I’m just posting the parts I think are of most interest to you, but you should read the whole thing…

The Orthomolecular Procedure for Correcting the H-K Syndrome.

Originally in our early testing, when the addicts came in we took a sample of urine for the simple C-Stix test for urinary spillover of ascorbate and a 24 hour specimen for a complete quantitative individual amino acid and related constituent column fractionation and assay. The results were so consistently low on the amino acids, and with no spillover of ascorbate, that we no longer go to the expense or bother of these tests.

The narcotic intake is stopped, and the addict is given the first dose of sodium ascorbate, high levels of multivitamins and minerals, and nine tablespoons per day of PHH Pro, in divided doses, a pre-digested protein preparation.

(Undrstand This Part) Since the addicts have a rather abnormal digestive system, it is an aid to direct absorption of the amino acids into the vascular system if the liquid amino acid dosage is held in the mouth as long as comfortable before swallowing.

The total amount of ascorbate given a day will vary with the extent of the drug addiction. It is never less than 25 g a day in spaced doses and can go to 85 g or more per day.

As a rough rule-of-thumb means of judging dosage: a $50 a day habit needs 25 to 40 g sodium ascorbate, $ 150-200/day about 60-70 g. Judging dosage comes with experience, and any errors should be on the high-dosage side because of ascorbate's extremely low toxity and lack of side effects.

The megadoses are continued for four to six days. During this time no withdrawal symptoms should be encountered (if any appear, increase the sodium ascorbate intake.)

Generally, in two or three days appetite returns and most patients begin to eat well and have restful sleep for the first time since the chronic addiction began.

One of the first observations to be made of the patient on this orthomolecular therapy is the rapid change in well-being; they feel good.

The megadoses are then gradually reduced to holding dose levels of about 10 g per day of sodium ascorbate and lower levels of the vitamins and minerals. The predigested protein is discontinued if the patients are eating well.

Research other sites for Vitamin C therapy as well. Here are a few to start you off;

http://www.doctoryourself.com/vitaminc.html http://www.foodconsumer.org/newsite...1806100937.html http://www.doctoryourself.com/ckorea2008.html

Vitamin C is actually Ascorbate and may be obtained in several different types and forms.

Sodium ascorbate is the preferred substance for the megadosages and a bottle containing 454 – 1000mg doses is at Trader Joe’s for $12.00 so if you were to work your way up to 10,000 to 15,000 mg per day it will set you back .20 to .30 cents a day! How much is a bag of H? LOL You should also spend $5 on a jar of organic honey to sweeten it with – it’s really sour.

We talked every single day like usually we wouldn't go more than six hours without talking to each other. He was the first person I would go to with everything, good stuff, bad stuff, just to chat bc we were bored. I've never had a friend that I clicked with like him. We would always joke that it didn't matter what the other one needed we would be there for each other even if we called one another and needed help hiding a body. This week has been the hardest since the funeral. With his birthday being yesterday and his name all over the local newspapers because of the court case it's been really hard. I let myself grieve and 've a mess from when I found out until the funeral but since then I've been trying so hard to push it out of ny mind or just numbing myself. And like I said I have no one to talk to, so many people just think he was some junkie piece of shit that got what was coming to him. Life isn't fair. Steve was one of the most amazing people I have ever met. He was smart and kind and would give anyone the shirt off his half if they needed it. It literally hurts how much I miss him. It's like I can't remember how life was before he was my friend. I'm sorry to be rambling it's just you guys knew him and unfortunately most if not all of us know the pain of loosing someone to this drug. My grief is literally overwhelming me and I don't know how to handle it or what to do to help move on or whatever but even that feels wrong. how do you move on from loosing someone you love? And I hate to be all self pitying but it's just not fair that life took my twin brother a few years ago and now my best friend. It seems like the best people get taken off the earth too soon. It doesn't seem fair that terrible awful people are allowed to grow old but amazing wonderful people die so young.

I have been getting into painkillers again as of about a month ago, and I don't use everyday but I at least pop 3 days a week. I don't want to get physically dependent again.

Even with a low tolerance, I can still take 70mg of hydro or oxy at once without getting nauseous. The most I've taken in a day this month was 150mg of Hydro.

So anyways, to the review... I was looking for opiates today and everyone was out. This one girl told me that she has a new type of vicodin and said that it was an extended release form that doesn't have any tylenol. I got the last of them that she had, which were seven 20mg capsules.

I immediately took 5 of them, equaling to 100mg. I started to get scared by thinking that I had taken too much and that I would possibly overdose, as my tolerance to opiates is fairly low, and despite taking close to 100mg of IR hydro at once, I feared that this new ER version would affect me differently in a dangerous way.

After about an hour, I started getting really itchy and my pupils became pinpoint. I wasn't high until about 30 minutes after that, and when the high it, I compared the euphoria to 40mg of IR hydro. This feeling didn't change, and still hasn't changed, almost 5 hours later. 

I'd say that there is more euphoria in taking 100mg of ER hydro than taking 100mg of ER oxy. Although, I definitely feel drowsy, and kind of dizzy. Overall, taking ER hydro was exactly what I expected, and I would say that if You had a choice between these and oxycontin, I would choose the zohydro.",1450404717.0

I want to by powdered fentanyl, or an analogue I think ""butyr-fentanyl"" is what I would want.

I want to take the fent powder, get some binder, and make my own ""hydrocodone"" to replace the real ones with.

I can get the press whenever. And he would give me the binder and fillers aswell.

I also need to know how much would be safe to put in each pill. I usually eat the gel out of the 100mcg patches I buy.

3xaa29,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3xaa29/how_opiates_became_my_doc/,3,https://redd.it/3xaa29,drugsnotpugzz,How opiates became my DOC.,"I started out like most drug users with marijuana in my early teens. Highschool was a blur of experimentation. I swore I would only ever do ""natural drugs"", but that quickly fell apart. I was soon willing to try anything I could get my hands on for a good buzz.

Psycadalics were my DOC after my first trip with some rather shady acid my friends and I had gotten from a local dealer. Although we just spent the day in the woods spouting out obscure observation about life, it was considered to be the best drug experience of my life. 

My first experience with opiates was from an old expired bottle of oxycodone my grandmother had laying around her house. Years ago, she had received knee replacement surgery and decided to take her supply of regularly prescribed T3's instead of the oxy 5 mgs the doctor had given her. There sat a bottle of 60 OxyCodone tablets waiting for my digestion. And to tell you the truth, it sucked. I had previously takin and enjoyed drugs that significantly changed my mental state. Drugs that placed me in a new world so to speak. This drug however didn't quite have the same effect. I felt warm and comfortable. Itchy for sure, but that wasn't what I was searching for.

Fast forward about six months. I was house sitting for my brother while he was on vacation. It was summer and I was working a full time job. That day, I had to go out of town to work at a different store location. I was driving back to my home town and I had an urge to trip that night. I didn't have to work the next day and I could stay up late and enjoy the trip. I ended up picking up a bag of shrooms and some MDMA. Seeing as I had tried both of these separately I had the desire to try them together. Being a stupid teen, I had taken enough for a rather intense trip with the thought that it would make for a good night. I don't want to go into much detail about it but I experience a very bad trip. Ego death was the worst part. Grasping onto the concept of who you are. It was a very stupid thing for me to do, especially along. But I do learn from my mistakes and I am a much more cautious person when approaching any substance. 

This trip ultimately swayed my drug preference. After that I quit drugs for almost a year. Weed gave me so much paranoia and anxiety that I couldn't enjoy it anymore and most other drugs seemed unappealing. I drank alcohol a lot for a while but only in small amounts. Enough to be buzzed but I didn't like to be drunk. 

I soon after rediscovered opiates. I had found some old T3's at my family home (where I was living at the time), from when my brother broke his arm five years prior. I thought, 'what the hell'. With the advice of the Internet, I downed 3 or 4. In that moment, I realized how enjoyable the opiate high was. It was the purest form of comfort. Like being swaddled in a blanket in front of a fire on the coldest day of the year. A pleasant headspace that makes everything a bit more enjoyable. I've used several different opiates since then. Never actually leaped into heroin yet. My use has ranges from binging for a few weeks straight to practically nothing for months. 

I guess, that's kind of where I'm at right now.

Tl;dr As a stupid teen, I had a bad trip and stopped doing drugs until I rediscovered opiates.

well, it hurt a lot. I developed man boobs within the last year, like full fledged gyneclomastia. This was strange to me, as I work out daily pretty much and eat well. So I knew opioids decrease testosterone, but I never had much problems with that if I'm not tryna have sex while noddinng out.

however, i didn't know tagamet dramatically enhances estrogen production and decreasing testosterone and is associated w/ moobs.

i ended up with man boobs that actually bothered me around 6 months ago. i am now taking 50 mg of tagamet a day after tapering and exercising A LOT and the man boobs have faded,

just a warning. us opioid users need as much testosterone as possible. this is a big side effect that should be shown on the bottle in bright red letters:

3xa3dl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3xa3dl/lope_to_sub_induction/,45,https://redd.it/3xa3dl,LopefulIndividual,Lope to Sub Induction,"Hi all! I've been lurking forever. I feel like I know you guys!

I won't get into why because it's *completely* irrelevant, but I've been addicted to Lope for 10+ months. I've been trying pretty obsessively to quit since then. I always get 8 or so days into a slow taper before the anxiety makes me rip my hair out. -One thing I've noticed about Lope in particular is that it quickly skews your perception of what withdrawal feels like. I typically enter into a deeply anxious/depressive state up to 6 hours before my nose starts to run. But because of the lack of research, I don't know for sure how much of those symptoms are psychosomatic.

I've been on Lope for 10 months or so. My dose for the past 2 months has been pretty consistently at the 140-160mg range. The half-life is somewhere between 9-14 hours. I'm probably on the lighter end of this spectrum.

About a month ago I was able to come clean to my girlfriend, parents and pulm team (CF patient). I was quickly referred to an addiction clinic in Long Wharf, CT. After preliminary tests (I requested an EKG), they decided that a 9-10 week Sub maintenance program was the way to go. On a side note, all blood panels and EKG's came back beautifully!

My doc told me to take my last dose of 140mg today (Thursday evening), and to attempt an induction on Saturday morning with 1mg. If I don't feel anything, I take another one. If I still feel like shit, I have to wait until the following day, Sunday, when I'm supposed to start with 2mg. Then I wait an hour, see how I feel, and take another 2mg. The plan is to follow this procedure until I have properly transitioned to Sub, or until I hit 8mg in a single day.

Now the reason I'm posting here, is because my gut is telling me that I'm not waiting long enough. The bottom line however, is that we don't know how much of the Lope is actually attaching to the receptors. I never needed Cimetidine or grapefruit juice or anything. 

Can any of you tell me if this plan is *completely fucking inane*? Any input would be greatly appreciated. We might decide to stick with the current plan. I just wanted to bounce this off a group of people who, collectively might have what I'm looking for.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: Made the jump to subs after 36 hours. Withdrawal during that time was more on the physical side which isn't surprising. Anxiety was still on the high side. Sleep was impossible-but it's only for 1 night. Like I said, induction started at the 36 hour mark. I was pretty fearful of precipitated withdrawal. I inducted at .5mg increments up to 6mg total for the day. No precipitated symptoms occurred.
For those thinking about making the jump, please keep in mind that in my case, no PGP inhibitors were taken whatsoever. My guess is that this had a dramatic effect on how long I needed to abstain before sub induction.

On a side note, the lack of precipitated withdrawals kind of defines logic given the half life of Lope. On one hand it's safe to assume that a very small amount of the drug *was* getting past the BBB, otherwise Sub wouldn't be needed in order to avoid emotional symptoms. On the other hand, if any Lope was affecting my CNS, I think Sub most certainly would've caused a precipitated withdrawal.

The only theory I have to explain this is that the Lope was not getting past the BBB in a high enough density to cause a compounding of Lope in my system. Any other theories are welcomed, as they might help someone else in need.

This thread didn't get a lot of attention, but it did help to talk about the process. I think with every new report on Lope, the shady veil gets lifted just a little more. Hopefully soon we'll be able to distinguish withdrawal effects on Lope with PGP inhibitors vs. Lope without PGP inhibitors. Thanks for talking it out, and keeping the trolling to a comfortable minimum. Good luck all.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT 2: Checking back in. It is now the following Monday. Most physical symptoms, and all emotional ones are gone. However, I have not slept since Thursday night. After hallucinating, and twitching in the office for 8 hours, I called my AdDoc. She believes some of the Lope withdrawal is is poking through the Suboxone. No biggie. New plan. (Actually I'm pretty scared. This is uncharted territory.)

The plan is to increase the overall Suboxone dosage to 8mg, and reintroduce Loperamide into the system for a 6-10 day course. We are to start at 50% of my original dose (35 pills), wait 2 days and take 25 (50mg), wait 2 days and take 15 pills, etc. The reasoning is that Lope was disintroduced too quickly. Apparently, many opiates will still give you withdrawal symptoms for a couple weeks after starting Suboxone. My doc and I think that this is what's happening here. My only concern is that given the long half life of Lope, this 'trial period' will last 3 or 4 weeks instead of 1 or 2. Any input here would be greatly appreciated.

AdDoc was nervous to introduce another medication for sleeping due to possible respiratory-related side effects. I asked her if a histamine channel would interfere and she said, 'no' and offered to write me a 2 day supply of Hydroxyzine, which is apparently very similar Benadryl. It'll knock me out *cold*, is not narcotic and not habit-forming. 

So I fucking hate the current plan. But I don't have any ideas any more. I'm officially at the mercy of my AdDoc.",1450396284.0

I would use for a few days in a row, get very mild withdrawals for 2-3 days and use again for a few days a week later. Eventually I went on a longer, 17 day binge that led me to have some pretty shitty (obviously mild compared to most) withdrawals which involved stomach problems (but not too bad since I had lope) feeling cold as shit for 5 days no matter how bundled up I was, restless legs, insomnia, no appetite and many other typical symptoms. Recently I stopped for 6 days and was pretty much not feeling almost any physical withdrawals except for some fatigue but that's really it. So at the end of that 6th (last Thursday) day I ended up copping and used about .15-.2 of decent stuff a night on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

But this was a very long day that had a lot of shit happen in it, and I don't have anyone else to tell or anywhere else to get it out so here goes:

-I told my usual d girl I needed to come thru early yesterday morning, even though she usually isn't up til late afternoon. Most of the time, if it's the morning, she'll just leave the piece somewhere and let me grab it and leave the money, but this time she swore she'd be up, and of course she wasn't. Finally gave up after a 2 hour wait

-Also had a middle man (who I'll call B), who somehow escaped from jail but just got caught again a few weeks ago, so I couldn't go through him

-Decided to go to B's hood to try and cold cop, since I was desperate and about to leave town

-Cold copping was surprisingly easy, went fairly well

-While picking up from random cold cop connect, B calls, he escaped custody again like two hours before he called me, he wants me to come by. Cold cop person knows him and tells him I'm already down there, he's begging me to come see him and give him a shot. Says he'll hustle up the money to pay me for it before I even get to his house. 

-I get done picking up, go to his house, he's already booming, he's got a line of cars waiting to get hooked up, already has a few hundred bucks, and has dealers of all kinds coming and dropping off like every drug and pill ever, except tar of course. 

-I hook him up with a shot and commence waiting on his tar guy to come by so I can get reimbursed. It's taking forever because heroin. 

-I see a bag of ice (which I've never fucked with) and ask B if I can take a look at it. He tells me I need to try it. Tells me I need to do a shot of it, or he was gonna cancel the tar order. He said he wasn't gonna charge me for it, just wanted me to experience it. 

-I decide fuck it, arguing with him sucks so much and it's free drugs. 

-Shoot the ice, insane rush, the worst crash ever, 2/10 imo. 

-Tar guy gets there, B hands me a piece that's obviously less than half of what I gave him. Typical B, he's got a super friendly personality but he kinda fucks you over every time. I've seen him give people dubs and sometimes dimes who payed for half grams. 

-He tells me not to leave, goes outside to meet another dealer for something else. 

-I'm pissed at him for fucking me over when I was trying to help him out, so while he's outside I just start opening his bags and taking a little of all the different shit he got delivered, which was a lot of different shit.

-He comes back inside and tells me I'm good to leave, I take all the shit I jacked from him home and sell it to get my money back from getting fucked over on the tar. 

**TL;DR** Day started with my d girl not answering, ended up cold copping in a cartel hood, shooting ice, stealing small amounts of a bunch of different drugs, selling it to get my money back, and then leaving town like the original plan.

How do you guys like to mix you Xanax and heroin? Can first then heroin or vice versa? And how much of each has you feeling reallllly good and nodding hard? My tolerance to h is a fair one if .1 has me feeling alright. I could do a .2 shot if I really wanted to but that's just to give you an idea of my tolerance. 

Edit:

I IV my heroin, bth from Oklahoma (if that even means anything)

Mild tolerance. I take .1 to feel good but .2 or more gets me great and nodding.

Xanax tolerance: none to low. - if I haven't taken any in a while, .5 does it's just of getting rid of anxiety, but 1mg + I start to get fucked up and disoriented and what not you know how it goes. Let's put it this way, I'm scared to take a full 2 mg bar at once, it just fucks me up too much and out of my comfort zone for why I like to take it in the first place.

After doing my .1 shot 1 hour earlier from now (3:00 pm central time) and then taking .5mg of Xanax about 30 mins after, I'm feeling pretty good. Slight h high, more of Xanax high.

There were about 3 months where I was spending $4,000 with this man per week, so me buying large amounts wasn't really a surprise to him..

But around 3 and a half months into spending ridiculous amounts of money I was flat broke. So. I had to figure out a way to rip him off.. (I'm obviously not going to go sick!) 

Well we always met at the same place, I'd get in his car and we'd go to Tim Hortons and go through the drive thru while he counted the money and I counted dope

So one day I asked him to bring $1500 worth. While we were driving to Tim Hortons I ask If I could do a shot to make sure its good shit before I put in that much money, he handed me the dope (he's also smoking weed and getting stupid), so while he's ordering at the drive thru I do my shot and pocket about $1000 worth of the dope. 

When he's done and finally expects the money I say I forgot it at home. He takes me back to my car drops me off and follows me home to get the ""money"" (I live in an apartment complex where when you walk in the building there's ten doors that lead to different apartments). So we get to my place, I go inside and just don't come back out.. 

About an hour later I hear gun shots, I hide away from the windows. He was shooting at the apartment complex.. Shoots about fifteen times and leaves. Cops eventually came and asked everyone questions.

I never tried talking to him again after this..

Anyways does anyone else have any crazy stories about copping or ripping off a dope dealer where some crazy shit happened that you'd never expect ?

ok, so I'm not really back but I am capable of posting again. 

I've currently got 33 days sober from benzos and dope, and it fucking sucks. I shake constantly and Im always too hot or too cold. Im in a transition house that is affiliated with the rehab I was in. It's not too bad I guess. Ill post more details once i get access to a real computer. 

It is 4:12am right now and I can't fucking sleep, though. I know I'm still kind of detoxing physically from all this shit but fuck. I miss sleeping. 4 hours? The fuck? Fuck me. This is bull. Ive turned into an emotional wreck. 

For those of you wondering why: I was sick of it. The violence, the stress, the paranoia, the cops........ It all sucked. I died 5 times in 35 days. That's not ok. 2 of them I was technically dead. There are some of you who know what happened behind the scenes and how much of a toll it took on me. 

I do apologize for not giving a proper goodbye. I heard there were a couple of posts about me (including a throwaway, grrrr I wanna know whooooo) wondering if I was alive. I'm sorry for making you guys worry. I am very much alive. Its just that I made this decision to get clean on a Tuesday and I flew down here on a 5pm flight Saturday. I wasn't even mentally prepared. 

I do have some writing material from my first 2 weeks here. But no promises as to when I'll post them this week. I do know I won't be frequenting here as often for a while. Seeing drug pictures and such is gonna make staying clean super hard, and I know that. I'm not unsubbing though mostly because idk what I'd do if one of you fucks overdosed and I didn't know until months later. Plus there are some other shit on here that I can comment on that isn't delicious looking dope porn. 

Now that I have rambled on for 15 minutes, I'm gonna smoke a cigarette and try to go back to sleep. I'll try to respond to as much as I can when I get up in 4 hours.

Love you all. Xoxo

I need to get new ones, but here in the bible belt its nearly impossible to find them. 

Anyways, the other day I couldn't for the life of me find a vein. I would hit get some blood, and then it would start missing. It eventually got so much blood in it that it just clotted up and I lost half of my shot. So since then the area that I tried to shoot in has gotten more and more swollen. It is constantly throbbing. It hurts to turn my head, and somewhat talk. Laying on that side is out Of the question. 

I know signs of infection are heat, swelling, redness, and tenderness?? I'm not sure on the last one. Maybe fever is a sign too? 

All I have is extreme swelling and tenderness. It isnt red or hot. It just keeps swelling and I'm in a lot of pain. 

My fear of going to the hospital ia getting treated like I'm junkie scum. Also, since this is obviously from shooting drugs i don't want to be left dope sick in the hospital. I dont mean i want them to put me on a pain pump or get me high. I just mean, im afraid they won't give me anything at all to help with the pain because I'm ""drug seeking"" in their eyes. Which im not this is some excruciating pain. 

So my question is, does this sound like an abscess, or just irritated from a dull needle?



***EDIT*** I went to hospital on Saturday morning, and they assessed the area. I got the diagnoses of cellulitis which is a step below an abscess, I think. So I got antibiotics and told if it gets worse then cone back.

And I really don't recommend this to anyone, but I tried it, and it worked. So I figured I would share my experience...



Also for this to work you need the following;

Cola that is cut with soda (cola that slowly bubbles when water is added)- H - 
Clean water - 
A bunch of clean rigs - 
Sterile cotton - 
Asorbic acid (vitamin c powder) can be found at gnc I believe - 
Clean spoon - 

Most important, about 20-30 mins of time, don't make this your first shot if ur sick or something, do some dope first to calm ur nerves then try this method out - 


!!Oh and DONT MISS THIS SHOT ITLL HURT LIKE FUCK!!!


Also tl;dr just go to the bottom

I've been shooting heroin for quite a few years, and everything has been pretty smooth up until about two months ago when I decided to try a speed ball. Once I got that Coke rush my life went downhill fast. So I'd say stay away, but if you are like me and have already crossed that line then I have some advice for you.


You ever get that Coke that when u add water little bubbles slowly form in the spoon? And after some time it all basically becomes solid? Well from what I've gathered online that is Coke cut with baking soda. And adding water is turning it into crack or base. Basically turns it into a useless solid.

So there are a few things u can do, u can either mix it and hit ur self really really fast before all that shit settles and it usually hits u pretty good, but I don't like being rushed to have to get my shot in, it makes me nervous and more likely to miss. And I would not want to miss that mixture. Plus I want to mix the Coke and my h together into one shot. Which isn't possible with that shit quickly turning into a solid, clogging your rig and wasting your h and ur cola.

So what I have come up was this, if you are convinced your blow is cut with baking soda, which I'm almost postitive that's my case, I can't be 100% sure what's in there, but when it slowly bubbles like that and starts to turn solid it makes sense it would be baking soda.

Anyways, so I tried a lot of different methods with little to no success. I would add cola plus water, let it sit until the reaction is completely done then filter with cotton, rinse with water, get what little water is left in the spoon and shoot that with my h. I would feel the h but not feel the Coke, and there would be a bunch of shit left in the spoon.

So that made me think, all the Coke binded to the soda and made the cola base thus insoluable in water. So scratch that. What I found works is this...


Get ur cola, I used .1 as a test shot, put in spoon, add around 20-30 units of water and mix until it's all dissolved. Mine normally turns completely clear then slowly small bubbles form on the spoon. They slowly rise and I stir up every min or two. Time it takes from mixed water and cola to bubble is about 2 mins.

So wait 2 mins, mix, wait 2 mins, mix, wait mix and so on until the solution has stopped making any bubbles. It could take as long as 20 mins. Once this has happened you need to add a tiny bit of asorbic acid (vitamin c powder, same shit they give out at the exchanges) I add about a match head size at a time and it fizzles like crazy and I stir and wait 30 sec or so, add another match head, stir, then wait a few mins. Now the solution is perfectly clear and there's no bubbling or anything going on. Throw in a cotton filter, suck up in syringe and rinse 10 units or so and suck up in same syringe. Okay so that's it for the cola part.

Now I'm left with about 20-30 units, I suck up about 30 units of water into this syringe from a clean source, making that syringe half water half cola mix that's 60 units, dump the spoon, wipe out everything, alcohol pad it, clean with cotton and let dry.


Next I throw my raw dope in, .2-.3 is normally pretty good. And I use the cola syringe with the extra water and spray the entire 60 units over the raw, then mix up like normal. Filter like normal, using a fresh new syringe to suck up this solution, rinse with 10 units or so like normal, suck up into that same new syringe.

So now u have like 60ish units of ur dope and cola mixed, any time I shoot cola I always double filter by stuffing a new syringe with sterile cotton and spraying everything into that and then spraying that into another new clean syringe.

Now I got about 50 units or so of cola dope mix, I normally suck up another 20 ish units to make it around 70 units total of goodness. I try to add extra water to keep everything easy on the veins.

Now just line up and fire away. And be prepared it's a pretty intense rush.

So now if u get Coke that's cut with soda that used to be useless for us IV users, there's a solution. I normally get good Coke that doesn't require any prep work but sometimes the quality falls. And if I'm after that cola rush I want it and there's no stopping me lol.


There might be easier methods out there, not saying mine is the best, easiest, or safest. But it works and is pretty simple and the only extra thing u need is 20 mins and the asorbic acid.


Any input on a simpler method or safer would be appreciated.

Be safe out there folks, especially with them speedballs. I did one now I can't stop! It's a totally different addiction than h alone. It's so much worse! But also so much better..

While most people here seem to be impressed by the pupil dilating effects of Opcon-A eye drops, they certainly do not work the same way for everyone and you therefore shouldn't rely on them to fix your pupils up until you know for a fact they work for you. This may seem obvious, but we junkies tend to plan things at the last minute and find ways to justify our usage in situations when we shouldn't (e.g. I can't risk my pupils being pinned, but hey that's alright, I'll just pick up some Opcon eye drops and use them before seeing the person who will be checking my eyes).

I can't have my pupils pinned this morning, but I used last night thinking I would just be able to use Opcon eye drops I just picked up to get them sorted out this morning. Well, I've been using about 2 drops every 5 minutes then redosing upon noticing no effect for about the past 30 minutes and my pupils are still unchanged tiny little dots.

Just putting this out there, like I said, even though it may be obvious to try a product before relying on its alleged results, because I know I tend to 'use first, figure out X after' and I bet some of you guys do too.

I have a habit of smoking about a point of black tar a day to stay well. 2 points has me comfortable most of the day while being able to sleep without having to clean the tutor I use to smoke. I save that for the morning.  

Recently I have actually been able to reduce this habit even more to the point where I don't get violently sick except for the first 24 hours. I would like to use this trip as an excuse to get completely off opiates or get as close to it as possible.

Here is what I have at my disposal (and I do not have the ability to get anything more to bring with besides probably Advil):

Benzodiazapines:

15x 1mg Xanax (GG 258)
1x 0.5 Xanax (S 901)

Pharmaceutical Opiods:

7x 5mg/325mg Oxycodone/Acetaminophen (White Endocet)
6x 30mg/300mg Codine/Acetaminophen (White M Box/3)
2x 5mg/325mg Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen (V 3604)

I realize having opiod pain medication is not ideal when trying to get through withdrawl but if someone would give me a guide as to how to correctly use all of this medication and make is last as long as possible while still being able to efficiently pretend like nothing is wrong.  

Basically I would like to know how to make these last as long as possible while making the withdrawl when I run out as easy as possible. 

Last thing I should mention is today I have taken 2mg of Xanax because I have nothing since yesterday. I also just had a mixed drink of Cranberry Sprite and a couple of shots of 35% Vodka. Do not plan on drinking anymore. 

Is there anything more I can take today to feel a little bit better? My muscles are killing me. I get RLS from hell while withdrawing. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Looking forward to the replies. Thanks in advanced.


Edit: I am trying to stay comfortable and not let anyone know that I am feeling anything other than normal. I plan on detoxing and getting fully clean upon return. 

I just want to stay happy and have a good time so as not to bring down the mood of the group because I'm not able to do something because I'm dopesick.",1450578628.0

Been browsing reddit for years but never got around to signing up. Anyhow, i'd greatly appreciate some advice specifically on how to get the best opiate high out of the meds i have access to...
A little background: i started out with opiates in highschool, namely hydrocodone, hydromorph, morphine, and especially oxycodone (since it is so well known and easy to get a hold of in the US). After graduating in 2011, a brush with the law and some family issues have relocated me to Argentina, where ive lived since. Literally took my last 20mg of oxy on the plane ride here which was obviously lame considering i was arriving at a place where at most a 5% of the population even regularly consumes opiate based painkillers. And beyond that, i can honestly say that here no more then maybe 0.5% to 1% of the populus consumes painkillers for recreation. H does not exist here, it is impossible to get. 
So onto the point. After almost 5 years here, by mere chance i have lucked out and met someone with access to weak opiates. So for a few months now i've been taking the local equivalent to T4's (60mg codeine, 300mg apap) basically i'm hoping to get the best possible high from the drugs i can get. 
Im currently dosing about 100mg of tramadol 1 hour before my nightly dose of between 360 and 480mg of codeine (CWE)... i do this after work every night on an empty stomach, and only recently began adding tramadol prior to the codeine. The first few days with tram and codeine were supreme, i really felt like i had hit a high similar to a low dose of hydrocodone or methadone. But obviously now after a couple weeks the tram tolerance has set in as well. Is there any way to potentiate this drug combo any further? If anyone knows of any good codeine potentiators, or other weak opiates similar to codeine/tramadol that i could try and find, i would be more than grateful.

ill tell one.. this one happens to be ME getting robbed though :/
i was selling pills at the time to support my habit. i did H, but pills made me good money. knew plenty of old people with nice scripts. but thats beyond the point, some stupid fuck decided to rob me one day for $500 worth.

id done a few deals with him and his friends so i wasnt worried. i usually carry heat, and they knew it, so i had a false sense of security. most times, id come to his apartment and meet him outdoors or at my car. this time he wanted me to come inside.. told me he wasnt feeling well(i happened to be ready for a shot myself), and i could come in and do my shot and shit too. didnt think anything of it.

i knocked. his girl opens the door and lets me in. before i can get a word out of my mouth, i knew i had walked into.. a 'situation'. in fact, it was pretty easy to tell since before i could even have a full thought, i was on the floor bleeding out of the side of my head. i got beat upside the head by the butt of shotgun. only took one hit to fuck me up. got me right in the fuckin ear..

anyway.. i wasnt gonna put up a fight after that, and they pretty much figured the same. but i wasnt gonna make it easy either lol. i at least made them search me for the dope/pills/money(around $800 total). i even made them throw me out. all the while i stared my 'boy' right in the eyes, trying to gauge him out i guess. fuckin junkie ass pussy motherfucker.. at least thats what i was thinking at the time. but im not really a tough guy by any means. im more of a junkie ass pussy motherfucker..

so i left. i was limping but i dont remember getting hit in the legs. my chest hurt too, but again, i dont remember getting hit there.. i got in my car, set up a shot of dope i had in the middle console, and got high. i went 'home', or what i called my 'home' at the time, and sort of assessed my situation. i called a few buddies over and gave them all a free shot. they were all a LOT more sympathetic to my situation after they got nice and high for free (;

told them all the shit i had just gone through, and they were DOWN. honestly, i didnt even care anymore. but i wasnt going to tell them that. they were getting hyped, and all it took was a story and some blood. before i knew it, i was driving myself and my 'friends' to the apartment complex. we each had a weapon of our own choosing.

5 men in masks hop out of a small car, armed to the teeth and thirsty for blood. we make our way aggressively to the apartment in question. it all happened so quickly i could barely keep up, but one of my better friends among our group was the one to take the lead. as soon as we got close enough, he fashioned himself with a large flower pot found lying in the neighbors walkway, and tossed it thoroughly through the front window and into the living room. immediately we hear screams from the group of boys and girls getting high on our supply, and it infuriates me.

i hear the sound of gunfire as we all make our way inside. they were just warning shots, but it got the job done. i watch as a young girl, maybe 16, is shaking from head to toe; waiting to die. in that moment, i felt terrible about what i was doing. what i was about to do. but we knew we didnt have a lot of time, and this was terribly planned out, if at all. and now were in too deep to hesitate..

we rush in like a fucking mob; neutralizing anyone we felt could be a threat. i personally brandished a nice old baseball bat. i took it squarely to the side of a few soft skulls. i didnt kill anyone that day, but ill be damned if everyone in that room wasnt going to remember me for the rest of their lives.

the tension subsided VERY quickly. once the entirety of our opposition was on the floor, bloody and beaten and crying and sobbing. we knew our job was done. NOW i was more worried about getting caught than anything else. we left all the drugs in a filthy array on the floor. paraphernalia of all imaginable kinds strewn about in the freshly ravished room. we did everything we came to do, and needed to get the fuck out.

i simply ran to my car, and the rest of the team took off in their own direction. i drove out of the apartment complex without seeing a cop in sight. when i had taken the first turn onto a main road, i finally heard sirens approaching. but i was gone, and so was everyone else involved on my end.

literally havent had a single repercussion for that situation. its been a LONG time now, but we never had the cops show up at our doorstep for anything. and the kids who robbed me never decided to retaliate. but we were prepared, and paranoid.. if anything, i really dont think they expected the outcome they got..

Shot a bit higher this time and went without the promethazine. Used tablets equal to about 110mg and instead of leaving a reasonably opaque result I got a crystal clear, water color.

However, this month I was also prescribed 60 Oxymorphone ERs. The insurance company was being an ass and wouldn't cover the generic (but they would cover the name brand with timeRx). So I decided to cough up the $180 for the generic. I have barely used it since I got it filled. However, I will be going on a vacation waaay out of state for New Years and had to extend my appointment out 6 days past when it should've been. So, I pretty much knew that I had to use the oxymorphone to keep me from running out of Oxycodone before the vacation. Last night, I thought of something. I looked up the solubility of oxymorphone in water. I found out that it was ""readily soluble"". YEEESSS. I dug further, and found out that it *was* possible to create an oxymorphone nasal spray! So last night, I scraped the coating off of 4 10mg ERs, crushed them, and put them in around 15ml of water, and 5ml of Grey Goose vodka. It gelled up pretty bad, so it wouldn't go through the pump of the nasal spray bottle (you have the squeeze the bottle for the mist). I decided to leave it in a container over night. This morning, the solution was pretty viscous, but of course, that didn't deter me from trying to get this to work. I sucked it up into an oral syringe, and put it into a 16.5ml bottle that has the same mechanism as an Afrin mist bottle. It worked! I worked out the math, and I am getting .333mg of oxymorphone per spray. That means for each set of sprays (a spray in each nostril), I will be getting .666mg. Someone did the math for me a while back, and figured out that around 5mg of insufflated oxymorphone is equal to the 30mg oral Oxycodone that I am prescribed. This means that 8.5 sets of sprays is about the same as taking a 30mg Oxycodone! I am pretty happy right now. This means that for the 7 days or so that I will be out of Oxycodone due to the vacation, I will not only avoid withdrawals, but also be able to get high whenever.

My question is if you inhibit CPY2D6 which is part of what you do by potentiating (with diphenhydramine or SSRIs, grapefruit juice, etc.), you slow CPY2D6's metabolism of oxycodone into oxymorphone, so by potentiating would you lose potency in terms of the strength of the high, but extend the length of time because more oxycodone is going to the k-opioid receptors instead of  μ-opioid receptors? I'm just wondering how this all works. I want to have some scientific basis for my potentiation ritual, because I dont entirely trust voodoo shit and I want to get the most out of my drugs jahfeel?",1450706511.0

So i am getting my yearly physical next week and am looking for tips and suggestions on how hide my use from my doctor who also happens to be a close family friend. 

I rail around 2 to 3 bags a day so it isn't that heavy of a habit but definitely one I think would be noticeable if I didn't take any precautions. For example, I'm sure any other sniffers out there can relate to very dark, black-greyish boogers. What happens when my doctor looks up my nose and sees those?

Also, will he notice anything from my heart-rate if I use before going for my physical? How about if I don't use before going?

Will he notice my eyes pinned? Do you eyes still get pinned if you just take enough to make you not sick? 

Basically, would love get some tips on what everyone does to hide their use from doctors during physicals.

Before rehab, I was extremely depressed to the point of being suicidal, which is something I don't say lightly, but hey, that's where I was psychologically before entering rehab.

In rehab, much to my surprise, I became happy with being alive again for the first time in years. I learned to enjoy experiencing human emotions, both good and bad, and developed a sense of drive and self-worth that I hadn't known in years.

However, despite the progress I made with regard to my internal happiness, self-confidence, etc, I still longed for the day I would be able to use again. I would tell myself that I really couldn't afford to use again because of the consequences that had come to be associated with it, but I was still truly infatuated with the drug.

Other people I met in rehab would talk about they're not disgusted with heroin, never want to see it again, don't have any cravings, etc., yet I simply could not understand how they felt this way because, although I hated who I became while in active addiction, I still truly loved the high.

Anyway, after 10 days out of treatment,  I had an opportunity to pick up and I did so. This became a 7 day relapse, resulting in my family finding out and becoming extremely disappointed with me, and while I'm disappointed that I let it continue for 7 days, I haven't fallen back into the self-hate and misery that previous relapses would instantly send me back to. Although it's too early to say, I think this may be attributable to the fact that I actually did work on myself I recover this time around instead of simply removing the substance, but who knows.

Having said all of that, I am deeply saddened by the fact that I won't be able to use heroin again for a very long time. In response to the relapse, I've agreed to drug testing 3 times/week, essentially being on lock down indefinitely by never leaving my house alone, and very likely going on vivitrol or oral naltrexone administered by a family member.

I'm very happy that getting caught is forcing my relapse to stop in its tracks because continuing any longer would cause serious physical dependency and eventual WD, but I hate that I'll have to abstain for so long. This relapse, for the first time, I didn't use all day everyday. Rather, I used only at nights after 9-10pm as a nightcap of sorts and it gave me something to look forward to during the day, all while retaining the satisfaction of being able to get through my everyday shit without being high first.

Sorry, I'm now realizing this is kind of a shitpost, as there isn't any specific question or point I'm making here. I guess I'm just wishing I would have used in this manner the first time around and also wondering if this true love for heroin will ever go away. 

Also, I've never used dope while in a state of psychological contentment/happiness/etc. I've only used while already in a state of depression. And Jesus Christ what a difference that makes. I haven't felt the guilt immediately after getting high. I haven't wanted to use all day everyday. And I haven't lost the spiritual progress I've made since starting my recovery. 
Has anyone else gotten clean and then begun using again in a different frame of mind and therefore gotten different results than previous attempts to use? I'm wondering if the fact that I was previously using to medicate my depression is part of why it always caused me to spiral so quickly in the past and if my change in psychological state will enable me to use without spiraling right away this time. Maybe just my junkie mind playing tricks on me. I don't know. I fucking love heroin.

I told him I was really proud of him, and that as much as I missed him and wanted to see him that it wasn't a good idea because I'm still using. 6 months of clean time is nothing to sneeze at, even if it was forced. 

Well, he just called me and said he's depressed and bored and lonely and wanted me to come over. I said I couldn't because I was in the middle of dinner and a movie with my fiancé, and that I'm very low on gas and I haven't been driving at night because I have a taillight out. He offered me gas money and kept pushing me to come see him, I kept saying I couldn't tonight but that we could go see Star Wars together this week if he really wanted to see me (obviously I wouldn't use in front of him, I still felt weird about it but I know I'm his only friend that actually gives a shit about him not getting back on dope). Then he says he wants to use tonight. I begged him not to throw away 6 months for a short ass high I knew he'd regret. I called and talked to him several times and told him how horrible my life has gotten since he left as a direct result of my using. I cried, I pleaded, I begged. Nothing's going to change his mind, and now he wants me to come with him because ""he's going to do it regardless."" 

I don't know what to do. I have narcan, part of me wants to go so I can prevent the highly likely event of him overdosing. I wasn't making that shit up about my car though, with that light out I might as well be driving around with a target painted on my hood.

I feel so guilty and I don't know what to do...I can't stop him from relapsing, but maybe I can save him from killing himself. I really need some advice guys...do I risk getting pulled over/getting arrested (if I get stopped for the light there's a good chance I'll get in trouble for other things I have going on) and go get high with him and be on standby with the narcan, or do I stay here and feel like a terrible fucking friend and keep myself safe?

Suboxone will soon be ever so important to opi addicts.


Hear me out.


Suboxone is currently SIII (who know how long that will last)-
With the Feds making hydrocodone an SII, pills are becoming scarce, and expensive as fuck. In steps heroin, which is awesome, but can be intimidating to those that won't take that path. With pills being so difficult to obtain, and prices being outrageous, Suboxone can be the bridge necessary to get you by between the struggles of being a pill head.


It is prescribed liberally by those qualified to do so- To be honest, Suboxone clinics are the new pill mills. Some doctors are serious about your wellbeing, but most suboxone doctors don't give a fuck as long as you pay them their cash. In my state, the average suboxone script is 90-120 of the 8/2mg strips per month, with only 1 doctors visit every 3 months to get refilled.

Suboxone is and will be GOLD- Each individual strip is worth $20 a piece out where I am. If you get 120 a month, and sell 100 of them, you now have $2000 for your DOC, with 20 Suboxone to breakdown and use as needed for that month. When you get your new refill, whatever you had left in your personal stash then becomes even more dinero.

It fucking saves people- Drug dealing/use may not be ""ethical"" being that society has dubbed drugs as being taboo. However, there is still a large percentage of population viciously addicted to opiates. While taking someone's money for drugs seems to be more negative than good, I can honestly say selling Suboxone to people who are very bad off, can do miracles for their lives. 

With the Feds completely fucking the pill game up, nation wide, Americans are feeling it, and it's only going to get worse. When opioid prescribing guidelines change his next year, pills will be as expensive and elusive as ever. They will still be obtainable, but it will cost so much, and people will sell out of scripts within a couple of days, max.

So do yourself a favor and try to load up on subs. 

Of course the other alternative is H, but I am speaking to the pill fiends here. Yall dope heads gonna dope ;) lol. And I'm not really one to promote the use of heroin to those that have not sampled that glorious nectar of the gods. 

TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SUBOXONE GAME WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!



NOTE: The Propublica Prescriber Check Up tool is a beautiful instrument to use in your quest for finding the right Suboxone doctor. Reminder, this database was created I think in 2012, so it is outdated by a few years, but almost every doctor you will find on there is still in practice. The only doctors you will not be able to find, are obviously doctors who got their Suboxone licensing after this database study had been completed. But the Suboxone website has a search that works just fine, you just cannot see the amount of scripts the doctors are writing.

I'm in a period in my life where every day I'm contemplating suicide. I am not and have never been an opiate user, but my decided way of suicide would be overdosing on heroin intentionally. I thought about this for a while and then I thought, instead of killing myself I could live for being an opiate addict. It seems reasonable that others have done what I think.

The junkie god has blessed me today, and I'm having one all-out session tonight getting high as FUCK, I'm gonna be nodding my fucking ass off, then I'm gonna go through withdrawals - I must have gone through >10 withdrawals by now, and they have never lasted longer than 4 days, ever. I usually wake up on day 5 and after a couple coffees and some cigarettes feel totally fantastic, really happy, so I'm hoping I'll be clean for Christmas Day. Am I right in thinking that its just the intensity of withdrawals that change and that the duration is pretty constant? Would like answers to this also.

Anyway, just wondering why I see so many threads/advice/posts about trouble FINDING a vein. HITTING a vein, I can understand - plenty of times with the thinner veins I've gotten blood then the needle has slipped out, but when I blow a good vein or if they're not popping, I can usually find one pretty quickly by trial and error. I just feel for them or just stick the needle in random spots on my arm and in no time at all I'll find a vein. Why can't everyone do this? Literally if I just start poking at the top of my arm and move down I'll hit blood pretty quickly. Why can't everyone do this? Why do I see posts complaining about not being able to *find* a vein?

so i got chronic pain and my doctor is a dick.  took me forever, like 5 years just to get the two norco 5's i get a day.  obviously this is nowhere near enough for someone who has used opiates for over a decade.  it all started with those sweet sweet 80's.  ohh how i loved them.  a person i was close to would get multiple scripts a few times a month for ten bucks a pill and would give me them for 12.  i was either a junior or senior in high school and would sell them for 20-25 depending on the person/quantity which meant a lot of free pills and weed for me and whatever people wanted to trade for them.  i didn't understand opiate wd's then and i only did them 1 or 2 days a week and never really had any kind of withdrawal.  when the oc's dried up i would do whatever i could find but keep it at the once or twice a week and things really didn't get out of hand until college. 

full time manual labor job mixed 2 or 3 college courses a semester and the weed just wasnt cutting it.  at this time we wernt a medical cannabis state yet and being the white dude going to the hood to pick up anything always sucks.  shit im 30 and i still hate it.  not that im scared, thats where i grew up, just the fact that the white hippy kid with the tye dead shirt and hemp necklace stand out.  a friend gave me a few methadone 10's and i ate one and felt like fucking superman.  i could get anything done.  a few days later he says his friends moms needs someone to buy atleast 100 every month for 2 bucks each.  score.  100 or 150 every month would be 200-300 bucks and i could make that just with the overtime i could now handle.  i thought i hit the golden ticket.  yup thought anyway.  after two years of this i finally got my degree and was ready to find a better job but knew i would have to drug test so i figured it would be time to be done.  told her i didnt want them anymore and introduced to her one of my friends that would buy her extras every month.   i still had no idea about withdrawals at this point and i was sure in for a treat.  methadone withdrawal aint no little bitch.  this was where i was clean from opaites from age 24-25 probably.  i couldnt find a good job because of stock market fiasco in 2008 and 2009 so i got a part time job along with the full time job i already had so i could pay my college off.  got out of debt and quit my second job like 13 months later.  i cant remember the exact number but i think i had 5 days off the entire year.  if i wasnt working i was home drinking dank ipa's until i could pass out and wake up go back to work.  alcoholism is also a bitch.  i have an addictive personality. there was that problem with crack for a year too but im not gonna get into that haha.

anyway after i quit my other job i met this girl that i worked with and things were amazing.  she had split up with her last boyfriend cause of his drinking problem so this got me to quit drinking, she helped me quit smoking cigarettes too.  felt on top of the world.  just going to work smoking weed and cuddling and watching cartoons for a year or so and things were amazing.  well she starting banging another coworker.  they were together for like 2 weeks and i was in a super dark place and she came back to me.  i took her back, stupid move.  six months later shes hooking up with the same dude and im donezo shouldnt have given her a second chance, sure as fuck didnt give her a third.  i was still depressed as fuck.  seeing them together at work everyday started fucking with my head.  i transfered stores but an old friend came back into my life, my old friend opiates.  

norcos and the oxy op40 and 80's.  i was able to sucessfully chip for awhile but again methadone was cheaper and lasted longer and at 5 bucks a pill i could buy more and stay high longer. like all day everyday for 6 months and i started to think about how bad withdrawls were gonna be so i decided to take a week off work to detox and would go back to regualr opiates when i got back to work.  i found that with using less time and less pills my withdrawals were actually worse.  this worried me but i pulled through and stuck to just norco and oxy on occasion.  then a friend went to pain managment and this doc was sketchy as fuck and just gives a list of meds he can perscribe, she says whats the stongest and he tells her opana.  things definately got worse, even just snorting these things were amazing.  he gave her 2 40's and 180 10's a month and she would sell me like 100 10's for 5 bucks each.  it was amazing.   sell half for at least double and get 50 free for the week to binge on and some extra cash to buy dones so the come down wasnt so bad then switch to the weaker meds to keep me going until that 4th thursday of the month when i could binge out.  after about 8 months she failed too many UAs and got kicked out.  i was so bummed.

then two years ago i met this girl who like opiates too.  she liked them more then me.  we started dating.  i thought i hit the jackpot.  she is so beautiful and had a 100,000 a year job while im fat lazy and work graveyard shift at a grocery store.  i felt like i won the lottery.  i couple years older than me like i like, amazing body, pierced nips, tounge ring, swallows, this bitch was amazing.  we partied a lot.  i could get morphs norcos fent and any benzos and she could get dillies roxies oxy sometimes.  we were a perfect team.  between her 1500 a week and my full time job and selling weed we had way to much money, or so i thought.  then i had to pay 300 worth of parking tickets so her truck didnt get towed and i started to realize how much of a problem she had.  i am bad, but damn.  she even lived with her parents.  parking tickets should be no big deal.  she had a seizure a week later from alcohol wd im thinking.  she likes the wine.  she told me she was afraid to die and was gonna clean up.  after 3 days of everyday trips to the liquor store and pills on pills on pills i decided we needed to talk.  it didn't go good.  we split up but remained good friends cause we needed eachothers help.  

this was about a year ago and it seems pills are harder and harder to find.  sucks in the back of my head knowing i can go cold cop in the next town over although i havent done it for years and it was always crack or trees but i still feel confident.  shit some places they yell at you.  makes it easy.  i didnt want to get into heroin but in my head i knew if my pill sources dried up and was sick i would be going there no problem.  my habit for the last year has been about the same cause of limited resources.  about 200mg morph oral a day and 10-20 mg hydro.  then any extras i can find.  which is a few fent patches a month and my ex once a month would get me 20 or 30 dilly 8's so i could binge for a week. fucking ten dollar 8's is awesome. also pst if i wanted someting extra, tried to keep that to once or twice a week though.  

so two weeks ago my ex text me and im busy then she calls crying asking if i had any subs.  she knows i got a bunch laying around for emergency.  meet her and shes balling.  starts telling me she fucked up.  starting shooting shit like 3 months ago and it spiraled out of control fast.  shooting dillies and coke every day.  this was jsut two months after getting out of the hospital for alcohol wd issues with her heart two months prior.  she tells me she going to rehab in two days but is sick.  i give her two subs, deny the money cause i hate to see people sick.  plus they are only seven bucks each and i had like 30.  the next night before rehab she asks if i have any extra morphs.  i had some on me and was leaving a friends house and passing through her town to get to mine so its perfect timing.  she says she want to get high before rehab, and i totally understand that, i would too.  i didnt have the heart to tell her the bupe was still on her receptors and she might barely feel it.  gave her one of the hundreds and told her she can have it since she is getting better soon but she needs to plug it, or eat it.  she takes it crushes it and says i need to shoot it.  i told her the only way she was gonna shoot it is if i shoot it too. she knows ive never done iv drugs and we just talked for 30 minutes the prior day about how fast it fucked up her life and for me never to do it.  i was kinda hoping she would just eat the powder but she walks away and says i have extra rigs.  my brain said no but the addict in me said yes.  not gonna say no to a beautiful girl putting drugs in my veins.  not gonna lie, ive always been curious.   get high as fuck.  nod and cuddle nod and cuddle for like an hour and a half and i knew if i didnt leave then i was just gonna crash with her and with her rehab the next day i wasnt gonna be the person to fuck that up.  30 minutes drive home with a stop for smokes and some snacks from meijer.  totally got some sour patch kids lol and some reese's peanut butter ice cream bars.  texted her a bit and went to bed.  dont remember the conversation til i read it again a few days later.  the last line killed me.  youre so sweet im gonna call you if they let me blah blah blah when i get out in two weeks in gonna help you too.  the lst thing she wrote got me.  ""take care of yourself"".  im thinking you're going to rehab you need to worry about you, not me.  she knows i was gonna try to kick on my vacation week in january.  

well i didnt take care of my self.  i get depressed with the winter and the snow every year and so much going on in my life i caved.  got some h for the first time with some friends.  into the veins it went.  i told my self that was a one time thing and four days later i was back at it.  i only told a few close friends but the dissapointed look on their face killed me everytime.  that was a week ago, havent touched dope or needles since then. i always told myself once it got to the point of iv'ing shit that i hit final point and it either quit or my life is gonna go to shit.  my weekend hit on thursday morning awake until thursday night after being awake 24 hours i slept for 24 hours.  i actually woke of feeling pretty good.  not in withdrawal and sluggish and dead like i usually wake up and i said fuck it, im gonna go for it.  last time i had opiates was thursday night and it its sunday night. thats 72 hours.  lope and stims and aleve got me through work last night and im gonna do the same thing the next four nights til my work week is over.  im sure ill be back to feeling shitty when i dont take anything on my days off.  but i should be a lot better by the time i gotta be back to work.  i could have never did my manual labor job without the lope.  shits a life saver.  i feel really good about this.  dont know if i can quit forever because of my spine problems but i dont want to have to use just to get out of bed.  tired of this life. always on the hustle for quick cash. last year when i tried to quit i made i 2 1/2 days and caved used everyday since so this attempt is already better.  not sure why i even wrote this.  i barely log on to reddit.  hopefully i can look back on it in a few months and things will be much better or i can pin point the time i hit rock bottom.   

tl;dr been a fuck up my whole life, at 30 years old tried to iv morphine and heroin or the first time.  decided i need to make some changes.

These were severe enough to warrant cervical spine fusion, with 2 different surgeries. By 2010 I was finally through the insurance red tape and had surgery #1 which sadly didn't take, even using my own bone to rebuild the disc. In 2012 I had the 2nd surgery which also did not resolve the problem. The pain and recovery on this was the worst I've ever experienced and I am deathly afraid of any additional surgeries. I am in constant pain on my left side neck/now arm and lower back and cannot function without having to take pain meds of some sort, which makes me feel horrible about myself. Until 2010, I had been drug free never even trying Marijuana, so you can imagine my mindset as these things were all new to me. I've never even smoked a cigarette at 44 years old. I look to you all here for some advice and input:

 1. I just got cleared for medicinal marijuana...I was given a cookie to try once and I found myself to be very paranoid. Not sure if the medicinal stuff works the same. Is medicinal going to increase my anxiety? Will it affect my ability to function in an office environment? 

 2. I have percoset 7.5 tablets and split them in half. I take half at 630am then the other at 10ish, then at 2pm and a last one at 5pm or so. I try to take melatonin or something to help me sleep to avoid taking more pain meds. Is this out of control? Sometimes it can be 3 per day when I am flying and working 16 hour days.

 3. I have always had anxiety and take a .5 Xanax tablet at night. It helps me sleep better though I still jar myself from pain constantly. I'm told it helps the pain meds function as it calms you...any input here also appreciated.

 4. Ultracet works to some degree and every few months I will stop percoset and go the Ultracet. Is there anything else I should check out? 

I travel a lot for work in sales and still work out even getting my black belt in karate somehow, though it was painful and I was bedridden for 2 days afterwards. It was something I had to do though it it took alot of percoset to get through it.

I don't like needing medication and am now finding my left arm is losing strength and constantly hurting as well, which is a result of continued herniation in same areas and also other discs. I have consulted with another surgeon who says I will most likely need another surgery but I am deathly afraid at this point. I've read many people would prefer to continue taking medication in a managed manner for the rest of their lives rather than roll the dice with additional surgeries that might do nothing at all or potentially worsen things. This is the route I'm leaning towards as I am admittedly afraid of the pain and possible failure of another surgery.

I'm open to any input and have tried hypnotherapy, acupuncture, physical therapy, Chiropractic and anything else that was suggested.

It was mostly OxyContin back then when it was only $30-$35 for an 80mg OC. Anyhow my buddy called and wanted me to drive him to ""Point A"" to get money and had it all set up to procure the drugs at ""Point B"" standard operating procedure right? He ran into the house at Point A and whatever deal he had fell through because he did not end up getting any money. He came back out to the car in a very angry scared look of impending doom. He was going to be sick and stuck if I took him back Home because he had no car or connects where he lived. After a 15 minute panic attack he asked me to stop at the local K-Mart he said he was going to pay with a check and do cash back or something or the other. So I stopped in the parking lot and we sat there in awkward silence for longer than we should have while he looked off into space forever it felt like. He finally got out of the car and started his walk up to the store. About halfway to the door he out of nowhere tackled this older woman!! And snatched her purse from her!! Like it happened so quick I couldn't believe what I was seeing. He got the purse and she was screaming and he was running back to the car, which I was throwing in drive and about to roll out on this fucking idiot. He was reaching into the purse and grabbed the wallet and pocketed it while he was running back to the car. The screaming lady got everyone's attention and a man came to her rescue and chased my buddy down and grabbed him just as he got to the backseat of my car (I was moving) so they had this really quick wrestling match moment where he was trying to get the purse from my buddy and he was trying to get him off him so he can hop in the backseat. I was starting to speed up so he quickly let go of the purse (he had already got the wallet) and when he did that the ""hero"" backed off for just long enough for him to dive into the backseat. Door open and everything I floored it and took a couple right turns to get off the main roads and we were gone!! I was so fucking pissed and cursing at him. I thought it was a failure on top of the fact he almost got me on felony charges! Once our adrenaline calmed down he pulled out the wallet and there was like $70 or so in cash. So we took the cash and ditched the wallet and the credit cards in a dumpster at a restaurant we were driving past. Either way we
made it to point B in time for us to buy double the amount of dope then we thought we were getting and we got high. I stopped fucking with that cat after that whole fiasco. So I get
Home that night nodding out feeling good. The TV is on the news saying ""Breaking News tune in at 11pm Purse Snatchers targeting the ______ - area!"" 
On the news was the ""hero"" man saying he acted on instinct and he heard screams and did what he had to do in the moment or some shit. Then they had the woman crying who looked a lot like my aunt and I was honestly mad at my boy for doing her like that.

I bum a cigarette from the pack I bought you yesterday, back when money was a word that applied to us. Cigs are as good as gold in our world, and I feel a momentary tinge of shame for swiping a couple when you had your back turned. I'm sure you won't notice, and if you do I know you won't say anything.
We ride on, the faint buzz of the freeway fills the silence between us. It's a Tuesday. The sober people are busy doing whatever sober people do. Working, picking up the dry cleaning by 4, sharing a new recipe for something involving Nutella on Facebook. I pity them for what dull existences they lead. I envy them for what simple lifestyles they have. I decide to think about something else.
You are driving too fast. I wonder if it's because your thoughts are just as disoriented as my own. I wonder a lot of things.
Finally we park. We walk. And we walk and we walk and we walk. We scatter the dead ends of our cigarettes across town, leaving a bitter history behind that no one will ever understand, something only known between you and I.
You tie my arm for me, but I assure you I can handle the rest of the process alone. Perfectly, gently, that melted brown liquid melts me. I'm off in the stars somewhere far away from here, being selfish and turning off the ticking time bomb that is my brain. I no longer feel the sharp bite of the wind, or the concrete under my shabby sneakers. I guess that's why I didn't notice you sitting so quietly next to me. Too quietly. You were probably gone before the high even hit you.
But the strangest thing is,
I'm not mad at myself for not being there to save you. Not even a tiny bit. I'm not mad at the needle or the substance or the addiction. I'm mad because you got to leave. Lucky bastard. You escaped this dark corner of an existence and I hate you because I'm still here. Still walking and wondering and leaving lonely cigarette butts all over town. Why couldn't it have been me?

she was in cali visiting her relatives (her cousin is my friend) and we hooked up  (it happened to be valentines day and we were good friends, and i told her if she didnt have one that i would be her valentine, and what was a play thing turned out real and feelings unexpectedly came out, she knew i was using H as well but wanted to stop...told her i stopped when she moved and i used behind her back but of course she doesnt know) and we were really into each other so we made ourselves ""bf/gf"" with hopes that I would visit her when I could since she goes to college in Canada.  being in a long distance relationship..the skype calls, masterbating to each other on skype, the intimiate talks we had texting and just video chatting and phoneing, 

lasted 2 years...yesterday she went with the ""i think we should just be friends deal"" and told me that shes finding it harder to reject other guys and that phyiscally she feels lonely and wants to go out and just have fun.

  said she wanted to end it before she did anything behind my back, although it seems that she met someone and is gonna go for him and give him a try but would want to dump me before cheating.  says she wants to stay as friends, shes crying saying that she still has feelings for me and what not and always wants me to be a apart of her life.  (in my head im just thinking bull shit, she feels guilty for dumping me and wants to say these things to me to make me feel better cuz im obviously the one at hurt here, she wants to be friends, i want to her to still be mine only, i played along and i just said maybe we could but first i need to make sure i dont have any more feelings for you before i talk to you again, ""as friends""

she'll tell me that she'll always be there for me, and that she hopes ill be happy in the future  also (pretty much what i told her but she wanted to say it back and says she feels the same way.   I told her no shit you want me to be happy in the future,  I'm the one that just got my heart ripped out and stomped on.   and you'll always be there for me? well youre not here for me right now...unless u meant as a friend, I could do that with anyone else.

3xtep2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3xtep2/nine_months_clean_just_checking_in/,22,https://redd.it/3xtep2,dnolan87,Nine months clean (Just checking in),"I'm back at my parents' house now, for the holidays, and I haven't been here since I got clean and moved to LA. Right now I'm just in my old bed, reflecting on the way I used to spend my days here, browsing r/opiates, and wondering what the fuck i'm gonna do to come up with another $20 before I get sick. I had a different username then, obviously, but that person doesn't matter.

I don't wanna preach to anyone about Jesus, or the twelve steps , but I do seriously want to just dump a bunch of shit out emotionally, and maybe some people will read it, maybe some will get resentful and shitty about it, or think I'm gloating about my sobriety (which isn't my intention), or maybe it'll help someone, or maybe no one will read it. The point is really that I need to dump a bunch of shit out of my body in text form, and it doesn't matter what the fuck happens to it after that.

First of all, I know what the fuck it's like to feel hopeless. And not even just through addiction, but even in sobriety. So I mean ""*feel*"" when I say it. In the last nine months I've been homeless, on food stamps and welfare, I've had to shoplift lunch *dozens* of times just so I wouldn't starve, I've been hospitalized twice (once for a broken knee at 40 days sober with no pain meds, and later at 6 months after coughing up blood from untreated bronchitis), and I (just weeks ago) lost my best friend of over 15 years to a heroin overdose.

My life gets like that. Things go really dark for long stretches, and they eventually get better, but by then I'm already gone.

I used to have a nice job, I worked in television. I made crazy money for a 24 year old. Had a nice loft apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with all those scumbag hipsters whose parents pay their rent so they can spend their afternoons eating sushi and buying ironic t-shirts instead of working 17-hour days like I had to.

But I had spent so long wanting all those things, that by the time I got them I couldn't do anything but feel entitled. All the time I spent *not* having them had eaten away at my insides, and it made me a dark, empty person, living in a small world all alone. I'd already been doing heroin long before I could afford it, and now that I finally *could* afford it, I felt just as entitled to that.

Anyway, I obviously lost everything. I ended up getting fired from every job I got, went to jail, blah blah blah. Most of what took everything away from me was just bullshit. Dumb fucking laws put in place to make rich people richer at the expense of poor people with the disease of addiction. That's the reality. And pile on top of it all the other drug-addled delusions my brain could concoct, there wasn't a lot of hope left.

Shit got really bad. Lot of hospitalizations, lot of shoplifting, lot of suicidal thoughts.

Finally in March, my breathing got so bad I had to be admitted to the hospital. Normally they just give you some steroids and antibiotics and a few nebulizer treatments, and you're on your way, but I was actually about to die. Whatever. I don't want to make this sound like some heroic story of survival. But I was gonna fucking die.

Still, the next day I pulled out my IV, walked with no jacket out of the hospital, hopped a turnstile, took the subway to the PATH train to Newark Penn Station, walked to Market and Broad street, and got burned for my last 20 bucks. Just straight up took for it. The fucking guy literally walked away, and I was too sick to do shit about it.

I went back to the hospital and just threw up all over the fucking place until they gave me a bunch of methadone and klonopin. I had a really nice chemical detox. Painless. One week in the hospital, covered by medicaid, and on the last day I had my brother send me down two bags of really, really good heroin taped to the inside of a dvd box set he gave my mom to bring me.

Then I went to rehab.

Medicaid rehab sucks, and it's fucking stupid, and everyone there is a piece of shit- including, and especially, me. But I could not have gotten 25 days of consecutive sobriety anywhere else. I couldn't have gotten any day count on my own that wasn't worth giving up to go shoot heroin.

They tell you over and over again in rehab not to do what's called a ""geographic,"" and that, ""wherever *you* go, *you* go with you.""

Fuck that. I moved to Hollywood.

I always wanted to be a comedian, ever since I was a little kid. I moved out to Los Angeles with about $200, and a suitcase full of Rosetta Stone language software I had stolen from Target. When I got on stage for the first time, I still had bruises on my arm. I was still sweating the bed and having using dreams every night. I stayed in a sober living house and shared a room full of bunk beds with a bunch of gay dudes. On top of all that, I was nervous, and shaking, and most of my jokes fucking sucked.

I did it again, though. Over and over again. I'd spend my days at the library writing, or going to AA meetings, or selling all the shit I stole before I got clean. I'd do 2 or 3 meetings, and then 2 or 3 open mics.

Things have gotten extremely dark at times over the last 9 months. Especially in the beginning. But I no longer measure success like I used to. I work a stupid shitty minimum wage restaurant job during the day so that I can make enough money to live on a couch and then I go tell jokes every night. 

I go on stage every night, and most of the time I'm just telling people what a piece of shit I am, and it's actually fucking funny. I found out that no one in their right mind judges you for being a drug addict. People will judge you for being a fucking liar.

So that's it. Just tell the truth. You can put everything behind you. I am a fundamentally different human being than I was a year ago. And I was different then from a year before that, and so on and so on. We're all human beings. We have the capacity to evolve. It's just up to us which direction we wanna set ourselves in. And we have to make that decision every day.

Did anyone actually read all that?",1450776033.0

I had this idea though, and i mainly get anxious and start wanting to redose, its not physical symptoms, more knowing they are coming, its a total mindfuck sort of thing i do to myself if i have dope still, but i was thinking of using meth to keep my head right to put off dosing because i don't chase as bad or as fast, i think, i haven't done it that much and wanted some opinions on stimulants being used to help with the headspace part of withdrawal, i know it can make physical symptoms worse but thats not my concern so much.

Also, taking stimulants with lope, do you guys think it would do good on withdrawal or what? i was thinking the stimulants might make you feel more happy so to speak and the lope get rid of your symptoms for the most part but i've not tried it.

Also how long do you have to be into being sick before your tolerance starts to drop? and if you take enough of an opiate to not be sick but not high, how does that effect the tolerance/withdrawal?

also i've heard of dextromethorphan being used to help prevent tolerence? does this work if your already tolerant or would you need to detox first?

As far as ROA goes  is oral longer then IV normally or is it dependent on bio-availability?

And i've been treated at a hospital for a blood infection and because i was straight up the doctor put me on tramadol while i was there so i wouldn't get sick, is this a normal behavior at all or was i super lucky? i figured at the time i had no other choice because i was going to get sick, and i was already sick from the blood infection

Sorry if any of these questions have been answered, i looked around and couldn't find or understand exactly what i was looking for so i figured, hey, why not ask. also, sorry for so many different subjects but its all about the same sort of thing.",1450775258.0

I won't be able to cop once there, and I know how very possible it is to bring shit through security The past 10 or so times i've flown, i've been with my boyfriend- He just puts the dope between his ass cheeks and tells TSA that he's ""opting out"" so they pat him down instead of him going through the body scanner. 
Since I'll be flying alone this time, I'm trying to weigh my options for getting shit through. I'll need to bring enough to not get sick the 6 days that I'm there. 

I know I could roll my bag up and shove it up my cooch, but I know I'll be very anxious opting-out, getting patted down and having a TSA agent right up in my face. What I'm wondering is, if I just rolled shit up and went through the body scanner, would it look any different on their monitor than if i just had a tampon in? I was thinking I could even stick a tampon up there with the drugs.  Have any other ladies tried this?

My other thought was putting it in a little container of makeup I have, and just keeping it in my bag. I have fairly shitty west coast ""gunpowder"", a light brown powder, which is about the same color and consistency as the bare minerals makeup I have. If I was doing this, I'd probably crush the gunpowder up a bit more (to break up any bigger chunks of tar that haven't been fully broken down into the lactose powder) 

I'd appreciate any advice, and apologize for how terribly this post is written. I'm not one of those people who is eloquent while high, as it seems a lot of people on this subreddit are.

I've got a pretty bad habit at the moment (g/day) and I know it's gonna be hell, but I've been told this sub is a good place to get good information and tips on battling withdrawals.

&nbsp;

For me, the worst part of WDs by far (and a big reason why I have avoided getting clean for so long) is a sort of restlessness I get inside my chest. Sort of like restless leg syndrome (which is prob the second worst part of WD imo) but in my chest. I've tried looking it up and I think it's like intense heart palpitations (and maybe high blood pressure), but I'm not 100% sure on that. But it feels like an intense, pounding itch in my chest that I can't scratch, and it makes my entire body completely restless. Laying still is not an option, and often times I will wildly convulse my body which sort of helps, though that could be in my mind. It's just completely unbearable. It comes in waves during the first few days of WDs, without much time in between the waves.

&nbsp;

I was wondering if anyone else experiences this, and more importantly, if anyone knows any good ways to treat it...with meds, remedies, or anything else. I've told a lot of my friends about this, but they just don't seem to experience it, at least not nearly as bad as I do. I'd REALLY appreciate any feedback, info, input, etc. Even if you just relate, cuz i'm starting to feel alone in this lol. Thanks!

I usually try to save my used dope cottons until the next morning. I leave a decent amount in them and aerate them safely. I've noticed that I have a good amount, have a dark color, sometimes it'll even look bigger than a regular shot I take, it will take a really long time to get a rush. I'm not complaining, the potency isn't affected; I still get a legit rush and feel better, but it just feels different. It takes quite a bit longer for the initial feeling to start and is kind of a build-up and the duration of the rush lasts a long ass time. I'm wondering if there's a îsciency reason for this, maybe at a molecular level. Its been mentioned by others so I know I'm not crazy. I just can't think of a reason it would feel so different, like a rush from a totally different kind of opiate or something! ",1450765923.0

I live in a duplex. On the other half, there is a ghetto family. I honestly don't know how many people live there, I think it's about 8. There are several children. Every single day, they have several visitors, most stay 2 to 10 minutes. In the past 30 minutes, they have had 4 different cars come and go. This is why I assume they are drug dealers. Cool, right? No. Not at all. Our drive way is small and our half owns 3 cars. They have 2, but only one runs. But they always, and I mean always, have other people over. Their customers are always in the way. Parking in our spots, blocking our spots, blasting their music. Oh, and my neighbors themselves are currently blasting their music at 1 in the fucking morning. These people are so fucking inconsiderate, I'm honestly considering going to the police. Drugs are cool and all but those assholes are affecting me, and you know what? They have a lot of children being raised in a terrible environment. I forgot to mention all the fights coming from their house or outside the house.

After shooting my boy a message trying to find out whats been up the past few days and having a pity party about how sick I was, I tried to psyche myself out for the drive back home and had actually convinced myself that I'd be alright.

Maybe some were already at rock bottom and felt they didn't have anything to lose, and maybe others just wanted to feel good just for feeling good's sake. It seems like this sub is divided into two camps: those who have no regrets about using, and those that would give anything to go back in time and not take the plunge. But is there anybody out there that this drug *has* definitively helped?

I don't want to bore people with a sob story, but I'm already at rock bottom, and things will not be changing, mostly due to medical reasons. I remember when I had an oxy script for ~6 months after back surgery, and it made me (artificially) happy. And I'd like to go back to that. I realize once I jump to the needle I'll slowly piss away all my savings and probably lose the remaining friends I have, but if I can ""feel good"" just a few more times with a little chemical aid, I think it's a deal worth making. 

My question is this- has the ""deal"" been worth it for anyone? Or have I just been programmed by society that heroin = downward spiral & death?

3xrgb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3xrgb5/naltrexone_questions/,0,https://redd.it/3xrgb5,Randallian12,Naltrexone Questions,"So I coercively took 50 mg naltrexone twice, once Friday morning, and another Saturday evening. I attempted to get high on heroin each time, unsuccessfully, of course. I felt a very tiny something both times, moreso the second time since it was about 32 hours after the initial dose vs the roughly 10 hours after the first time I tried (I took the second naltrexone a couple hours after shooting dope the second time, 32 hours after the first dose). 

I'm wondering, does your tolerance for opiates (heroin in my case) build even when you're on naltrexone? I know they say that it is quite dangerous to either be trying to get high on opiates while on naltrexone because you may wind up overdosing without really getting high because you try to push past the naltrexone or that once you're receptors and system has eliminated the naltrexone from your system your tolerance for opiates is extremely low and the receptors are very sensitive. I'm wondering if this is *still* the case when you're using heroin while on it like I'm doing because it just seems dubious that my tolerance for dope will be 0 tomorrow evening when the naltrexone/6-β-naltrexol metabolite have essentially fully cleared my system and I'm able to get high again, but who knows. Anyone got an inkling of an idea for this?

I've now figured out that naltrexone isn't a pill needed to be taken daily for opiate abstinence since the shit seems fucking glued to your receptors for what seems like 72 hours after doing some research. I did a few more shots tonight, ~42 hours after the second dose Saturday and feel a little higher (I think, it's subjective) than the previous two times. I can almost appreciate the underwhelming high for some reason. It's like a slightly motivating feeling without a serious nod or anything. Don't get me wrong, I want the full-fledged highs I've been used to since I started shooting dope, by God. I also wonder does taking it multiple times, let's say back-to-back for 2 days like I did make it take even longer to get high again after the final dose, i.e. building up in your system? I wouldn't think so and would think it would take just as long as after the last dose, in this case 72 hours from the Saturday evening dose, being tomorrow evening. I'd understand it would probably take longer for the body to eliminate say 100 mg taken at once vs. 50 mg at once but not so with my case staggering 50 mg roughly 36 hours apart where the body has already had 36 hours of time to eliminate the original 50 mg. Regardless, I'll save the rest of what I have for then so as not to continue wasting more money on this stuff while naltrexone is in my system. 

Needless to say I will not be taking naltrexone/getting a Vivitrol injection until I'm ready to actually be done with opiates since obviously this antagonist does its job and it's basically impossible to get high while on it or to unglue it from the receptors except for the passage of a few days. 

Anyway, thanks for any ideas and experience on this matter or even with the Vivitrol injection because I plan on getting it here in a couple weeks and being done with opiates for awhile so I can get my life back on track.",1450738593.0

Ok so this other thread sparked my brain into remembering my early childhood love for benadryl and thinking about it that could be considered my first ""high"" 

At the age of around 10 I would take a bunch of benadryl and fight to stay awake. It was fun and although it lacked the euphoria of opiates it felt good. I also would take a bunch of nyquil with similar effect.

Shortly after I smoked cocaine in a joint at age 12 and then kept progressing like many of us have. And now here I am in my late 20s where I landed at top of the mountain that is heroin via IV :/ Let's hear your stories smack heads!!!

So, I recently started IV'ing (please don't write shit about how I should quit now, I know I know), and so far everything has gone smoothly except these last 2 times. I've done different sites each time, but for some reason I get a red spot about the size of a quarter at the injection site that lasts for about 1 hour. It doesn't hurt or puss or anything, kinda itches so I'm wondering if it's more just like an allergic reaction? Or maybe my arms just aren't used to IV yet?

My process is as follows:
1. Measure out the H, place on spoon
2. Grab a new needle, fill it with bottled water, squirt onto H
3. Mix
4. Grab a small bit of a cigarette filter (I know this is bad, but I have yet to get sterile cottons), drop in mixture, suck up with syringe.
5. Use a tourniquette, insert syringe, register, release tourniquette
6. Inject

About 2 minutes after injecting I get the red spot (sometimes there's one big spot and a few smaller spots around it).
It is hard for me to pull back the syringe to register, so could I just be moving the needle around too much?

I register every time and get a rush, so I know I'm in the vein. Could some material just be leaking out of the vein?

And how do you know when something like this is serious? Will it hurt and keep getting bigger?",1450722240.0

I ask him if it's alright to put a little bit on the foil to square me up so I don't have to wait till I get home . Tells me it's no problem and to go ahead .

Let the guy in and a guy comes out the bottom flat and I recognise him as I've sold him weed in the past and we get talking and offers me a run up the road as he is heading to Glasgow . Offer him some petrol money but he refuses it he asked me where he can get some Valium as he's wanting to come of alcohol so as we are heading to my bit I show him a house he can go to and get some . Drops me of at my house and I tell him how to get on the by pass to Glasgow and to give me a phone round about the end of Feb if he's looking for some weed . Get in the house cook up a charge and here we are :) stuffs alrite not the best but it'll do for now .

All I know is I've been dying to ask someone, to gain a little perspective, or at least get this out in the open and off my chest. 

I went home for Thanksgiving this year, which was the first time I've been home in 2 1/2 years, and within this time I had completely threw my life away by losing my job, going to jail, falling lower than I ever thought imaginable, then got clean turned things around, and by the time I was back home, pretty much came around full circle.  It was a very emotionally significant trip for me though, my Mom is my hero, so being around and seeing how happy just having me around made her was good and bad. My younger brother who is also battling heroin addiction, was in more trouble than ever, and while feeling responsible to become the role model I should've been to begin with, I also tried to reveal my faults in order to connect with him so he could have a confidant who without judgement would be there to give advice given the circumstance that he always told the complete and utter truth. I wanted him to get better,  of course, but at least he could confide in me, and feel safe to reveal his true self, in a manipulation free zone I felt that open communication was the first step in getting through to him. 
Long story short we had a lot of catching up to do, without near enough time.  I told him I loved him for the first time ever (I'm 28, he's 26), and now more than ever I felt it necessary to actually open up, for once, be vulnerable,  and truly show my affection and predisposed nature to protect him. Although this seems irrelevant,  I promise this is where the problem lies. 

The day I left I took the opportunity to reiterate how much he meant to me, and throw all the unresolved issues from the past in attempt to convey a desire to evolve and mature into brothers who could depend on each other. He previously resented me for being favored by our mom (our Dad is a desperate drunk who despite holding it together for 15 years, fell fast and hard into a puddle of self pity, and worthlessness ). When he dropped this bomb he warned me that I  wasn't going to like it, and honestly even a month later I'm still not sure it even sank in. He told me that I was deceived by our parents my whole life, and even though my parents were married 5 years before my birth, I was not a biological match to the only dad I ever knew. 

So there it is, my dad might not be my real father. I know this ultimately makes no difference as far as I am concerned as a person now, but the thought of both my parents and the entirety of my extended family reducing me to the point of an outcast and presumably for my own good is to say the least unsettling.  It brings into perspective why my dad was always adamantly withdrawn and disconnected,  but also provides him yet another reason to justify his alcoholism.  So really I can say it doesn't really matter,  but at the same time I'm horribly confused,  and instead of just brushing it off and moving on, I find myself completely unable to process it mentally or emotionally.  I'm terrified to even hint at the possibility when talking to my family and friends, like I'm hiding the fact as if I were ashamed, when the only thing I think I'm justified in deriving from it is a feeling of deceit and from a source that is incapable of it to begin with.   So there it is...sorry for the novel, if anyone even remotely amused with this enough to provide your input I would appreciate it.  I know this isn't going to define myself from this point on, but I am struggling to figure out how I even feel about it so please appreciate that and take it into consideration when considering adding your input.

Because this will practically take away withdrawal symptoms.*


 home opiate detox.
This is for a RAPID detox, it's not perfect but it did the job for me and friends a lot of the time. 
This has saved me from plenty shitty family get-togethers. 


**RX Meds (Optional, usually easy to obtain.)**

-Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Klonopin, Ativan, etc.)

-Gabapentin (Neurontin)

-Suboxone (For people with a larger habit.)


**OTC Meds**

-Robotussin Gel Capsules (Containing DXM HBr ONLY)

-5-HTP (Optional)

-Diphenhydramine (Bennadryl, Z-Quil, etc.)

-Melatonin

-Iburpofen, Alieve, etc.



**For those who have a the tolerance of like 90-250mg of Oxycodone (5-15 bags a day)**

*If higher, just alter based on below method.*



**Day 1 - 3:** After about 14 hours after your last opiate dose take 1mg of Xanax or 1mg of your benzo. If using Ativan I recommend 2mg, and if using Valium around ~15mg. I would re-dose about once every 12 hours. Then take about 900mg of Gabapentin. This will help with the cold sweats, restless legs and works well in combination with the benzos to lighten your mood and take the edge off, maybe even a little euphoric. For this kind of tolerance if you have 2mg of Bupenorphine (Subutex, Suboxone, etc.). Now would also be the time to take 50mg of DXM. This isn't even a threshold dose, its just a normal dose that is known to help.  At night proceed to redose on the Gabapentin and take 100mg of Diphenhydramine and a dose of Melatonin. This will help you sleep which is critical to recovery. Take any OTC pain killer if need be. Continue this for 3 days, slightly adjust doses to desired comfort.



**Day 4-7:** Basically follow these doses, just like you did for day 1-3

-1/2 of previous benzo dose. (ex: 1mg would be 0.5mg)

-600mg of Gabapentin 2x daily.

-Stay at 50mg of DXM 2x daily.

-1/2 Diphenhydramine dose.

-OTC pain medication as needed. 

-1/2 of Suboxone dose. Try to go as low as possible.



This isn't fool-proof, I'll update when I get time. But this has worked for me plenty of times. Don't think there won't be discomfort but there will be but not NEARLY as bad. I'd advise against high doses of Loperamide but you can take that during this process as well. Marijuana is always GREAT to have on hand. Can be just the thing you need sometimes.



**NOTE: If you grabbed some 5-HTP from your vitamin store follow the directed dose during your entire detox. This can really help with the depression and mood issues you have during detox and even in PAWS.**

I've been using roxies for more years than I want to think about now. Done dope periodically when I could find it and though I'd rather that, it's hard as fuck to come by in my area. Especially for someone such as myself. My main pill guy knows someone who slings H and I've been trying for a year now to get him to turn me over to him and he finally caved. I haven't bought pills off him in a solid month and he's going through a divorce and is in love with me so when he called me in a drunken stupor wondering where I'd been, I made my case and got the guys number. 

Pretty sad to say how stoked I was to take that ride and the sheer joy of knowing I'd finally made that connect. Super smooth transaction, got an extra point outta the deal, and have been having a good ole time snorting it all night. 

As excited as I am though, I kinda feel like I've just fallen down the rabbit hole. If I wouldn't have gotten turned on to this guy I'd still be doing pills and in the grand scheme of things I know logically that one really isn't any better than the other. I still can't help but think that I've kinda moved into some new stage of addiction in any case.

Prednisone is an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4, so if I took prednisone along with a 2-4mg dose of buprenorphine, it would cause more norbuprenorphine to be metabolized, resulting in more norbuprenorphine at my mμ receptors. 

I may totally have this backwards though, and it may just cause the drugs half life to shorten and the duration of the high, and not actually increase intensity/potentiate the effects at all.

Anyone have any insight on what taking prednisone with buprenorphine would do metabolite wise?

I don't want to take the prednisone solely to increase the high I get from bupe, I'm taking it for allergy related reasons, but when I read up on it being an inducer of CYP3A4, it got me thinking it would increase the high I'm already receiving from the bupe I took a little bit ago.

It obviously does not synergize, prednisone is a steroid, so that's not what I'm getting at here.

Couple weeks ago I got some fentanyl powder. No idea the doses, it was cut, but My friends were getting somewhat high on half a gram of it. I was taking something like 5 or 6 grams. Kratom apparently has a cross tolerance to other opiates. Anyway, I took the fent powder all day everyday for about a week straight. It's been 7 days now sinceI last had any and have been trying to go back to kratom. That is not really working well. I mean, if I choke down my normal dose (18 grams) I get relief for about 6 hours, sometimes much longer depending on how well it absorbs (it's a strange plant) but I have to take enormous amounts multiple times a day to feel ""normal"" and that is just not feasible. I've stuck to dosing just one 20 gram dose per day for the last couple days, but I'm honestly not sure if my brain will adjust to this over time or if I'm just going to have to ride out withdrawals.

First in their family shelter, and then in their individual adult shelter. I hated the agency but loved the work. And they just recently opened up what they call a ""warming shelter,"" which is basically a shelter for single adults and they are allowed to be under the influence while there. The other shelters in my area will breathalyze or kick people out for being fucked up, but in this one, it's allowed as long as people can still walk and function. 

Anyway. My ex still works there and has been telling me stories. They just opened, so it's really new, and they are feeling things out. But i guess he works with a bunch of really green, clueless ""do-gooder"" types who have caused a bunch of problems with the clients because they don't know how to handle shit. So while on the phone the other night he was like, ""man, i fucking wish you still worked here. We need you."" 

And i miss it. I love that work and it's the only thing I'm good at, and i am DAMN good at it. So the ex contacted the boss, and the boss said, ""have her call me ASAP about a job."" 

So. He is on vacation until tuesday, but I'm hoping he will take me back. The only problem is that the ex has told him of my substance abuse issues so i have to bullshit my way through that, which is fine, i can do that. And in my line of work, SA issues can be a bonus, not a drawback. 

And also, to make this relevant... The ex told me that he accidentally caught someone shooting up in the bathroom and had to kick him out. My first thought? ""I wonder who his connect is and how much he pays."" 

My second thought was ""Fuck, if i start working there again, i won't be able to hit the needle exchange anymore."" ",1450942009.0

I hate that my cousin steals my pills. WORST. CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. EVER.,"Throwaway bc he might be on here too. Too many details of my life under my usual username.




I have cancer, so I'm on a shit ton of pills--including oxy, dillies & xans. I'd never tried rx pills before getting cancer, but now they're my only source of recreation besides weed (can't drink bc of chemo & I imagine MDMA, shrooms, Coke, etc. would be ill-advised too). My pills are crucial to my happiness, and pain relief obviously, at the moment.




My extended family is super close, so we all stay at my grandparents' house for about a week over Christmas. I have quite a few cousins, all in our 20s, and we're all very close knit--more like brothers and sisters. Besides smoking weed, Chris (name changed) and I are the only ones who dabble in drugs. Over the past few days, my bottles have been getting lighter--with blues and dillies being half of what I had 4 days ago. I haven't even touched those pills bc I've been plugging oxy oral solution all week (awesome, btw). During casual conversation, I asked Chris if he was into pain pills. He said he liked them but stopped using them bc of the addiction risk. 



Forgot to mention, Chris has had access to my pills bc there's no locks on the bedroom and he's alone in the house often. I love him like he's my little brother, but I'm really upset about this. Fuck the pills, I'm really hurt he took them knowing the cancer causes me a lot of pain. I'm hurt even more that he'd steal from me when I'd give him some if he had just asked. Most of my cousins have already pushed Chris away bc of his immaturity in general and his substance abuse issues (mostly alcohol that they know of). I'm one of the few that still can stand just being around him. Now, this happens. 



I love Chris and I feel like being confrontational towards him is just going to make him get defensive, then act out worse or get more fucked up more often. But I need him to know that stealing pain meds from your cancer-stricken cousin is something that would cause some families to disown that person. I need to know the depth of his obviously active opiate addiction, and I need his promise that he'll get help.



What do y'all think? Are my hopes unrealistic? I just wish I could rewind 15 years to when there wasn't any cancer or addictions, just lots of laughter and a homemade slip-n-slide in my grandparents' backyard.",1450939016.0

It's not ALOT of money ($120 of mine plus $40 of my cousins) , but sometimes it's about the principalities lol.

I live in a bullshit little town n east TN so I know quite a few junkies like me . They are way better at getting high than I am. I stick with pills and weed. These cats do everything under the sun, and make me look novice. Anyways , I met a  young white trash couple named Skillz and Deb. They're , maybe like 25 ish thru one of my real good hook ups. Skillz was telling me how he went to the sub Dr and had a great deal. $20 a pop. I was like cool , we exchanged numbers and I told him I'd hit him after work with cash. I went off to work till 8 and make enough to grab a few. Called Kristy , my Cuz , to get the rest of the money to get few more.
 
So when 8 o'clock arrives I start lining up the deal thru him. He has me meet him at a gas station sorta out west. He says he's in a hurry to go eat or sum shit. I tell him I want 8. The usual 10-15 min wait time bullshit. So he pulls up beside me and has a stack of subs. He peels me off 8 out the stack. We talk for 20 sec and he drives away. I get in my car and drive away. I wasn't feeling good so when I got on the road I peel a pack open and NOTHING. Im like fuck me I dropped it. I pull over and look everywhere. I find nothing. I start looking at the 7 other packs and feeling the back. THAT MOTHERFUCKER I thought. 

I started calling that motherfucker. 50 times back to back. I get voice mail. I'm not a badass but I'm not afraid of this dude. I call and call and call all-night plus texts galore lol. He finally answers and tellz me how times are tough and he'll get right with me when he goes back to the sub Dr. Fuck that buddy and fucky you is my thought. So I tell him ""Dude , ya got me. Give me half back and I'll let this go"". He's like fuck you. I make this offer one more time and get no response. Funny thing is I don't know shit about dude or his strung out dead eyes bitch. All I had was his nickname and a phone number...
 So I kick my junkie brain into action. I get on craigslist and make a add in the casual encounters m4m part. I take dudes name and number and made a add saying I wanted to meet up with dudes to suck their sucks. All I need was somebody to send a pic of their dick to my phone and i d choose a winner to meet up and blow em. I said my gf was outta town for a few days and I wanted to play lmao. I did this in 3/city's craigslist. Somebdy did this to a friend of mine and he got over 100 pics so I knew how this was gonna go down lol
  The very next day I made a new add saying how I met up with and thanked 3 guys. The new add said I wanted to meet up with MORE guys this night. I had one mutual friend who knew them. He laughed his ass off telling me how many pictures they were getting.They texted me wanting to meet up. He said he'd been to prison yadda yadda bullshit threats.  He would get sooooooo mad when I suggested he loved the cock pics. He threatened me. His girl threatened me. Told em to come see me. They knew were I worked. They knew were I lived.

And any comments with sourcing with be deleted. It's the rules. 

So first off I wanted to know the best way to plug. I'm a tall guy 6""2 and it seems like some oral don't work for me not sure if it's because im talk so theres more distance or maybe im constipated from daily use. But orginally i started out using the OTC oral syringes they have at pharmacies and realized those things are FAT and also not shaped the best with a flat base and a point at the bottom. I wanted to find an oral syringe that would be similar to almost a pen or even a normal syringe with out the needle. I tried that before and the only issue was there was almost no pressure so it didn't work well with constipation. Idk if someone can tell me what they use for plugging. A link would be best to understand but I think that's illegal so try your best to describe what it looks like. 

Also idk if we can share links to online harm reduction supplies or not. Yes I am curious about needles but mostly im more interested in all harm reduction equipment. I was wondering if Tracy still ships out anything like this or if she does only narcan. I would still be interested in narcan however but I do live in a state that they say it is OTC now so I'll only ask if I still am having trouble. 

Can supplies like these be picked up from methadone clinics or do they only focus on treatment? I work next to a clinic and have been thinking about taking the plung to methadone for awhile maybe if they have works I can go Over there and ask for some and while I'm at it find out about the program. (I just did a post about methadone and heard amazing things thanks for all your responses but I am not looking to go into that in this thread). 

And finally going in person gave you guys overall had better success at some pharmacy stores than others. I think I heard Walgreens is good any other stories or do you believe them all to be random and up to the pharmacist? Also when might be the best time to go get them. I'm thinking about grabbing some tomorrow on my drive into work in a nice shirt and tie. I'm guessing any time is better than going at 10 pm-2am looking sketchy and strung out. 

Thanks a lot for any response in advance. I feel like I like i probably sound like a huge rookie whose 16 and never shot up. But I just always had 2 friend take care of it for me. Ones doing his 2nd 90 days stretch in jail for pissing hot cause he can't stay off the dope. And the other disappeared idk if he went to rehab or maybe just deleted everyone's numbers that used and maybe even moved away.

Hi reddit! I'm new to the site. I'm not quite sure how this whole thing works so I apologize in advance if I'm posting this in the wrong place. I'm so sorry this is so long. I just want the best possible insight I guess. Thanks so much in advance. It means more than you know.

**Anyway..Quick Rundown:**


I'm a girl in her early 20's who's ex boyfriend is battling an addiction with heroin/opiates and I'm not quite sure how to not only support him, but also keep a handle on myself emotionally. (I still have incredibly strong feelings for him).

My ex has been a drug user since I've known him but it has gotten worse and I'm beyond worried.

He has depression and before, he would always use less hard drugs (mostly weed and acid) to curb it. However, after being caught by the police with illegal substances and being banned from smoking weed by his probation officer, he turned to opiate abuse and smoking heroin, sometimes even blacking out from it. He finally went to rehab over the summer and for a while remained clean.


**This is what's happening as of late:**

My ex and I have had a super rocky relationship since our breakup. But three years later, we've become closer than ever before, even kissing and cuddling again like we used to. 2 months ago, he sent me an incredibly heartfelt text about how much he appreciates me for being on his side, giving him hope, and not seeing him as a monster like he sees himself. He told me he was terrified of me giving up on him and how much my support means to him. This is how he felt. Until recently.

It's been a month and I haven't heard anything from him since a lengthy and fond fb message he sent me while high. Out of nowhere he blocked me on text and social media (except fb). During this month I've been beyond worried. I know friends who know people who have died from smoking heroin. 

Earlier in the month while he was ignoring me, my anxiety got really bad and I was afraid he was using heroin again. So one night while I was drunk, I typed in his twitter name on google and it led me to a reddit posted an opiate thread (based on his comment I knew it was him). As wrong and invasive as it was, my drunken curiosity got the best of me and I found out he was using heroin, even combining it with cocaine. I stupidly messaged him on fb saying I knew he was still using and begging him to stop and talk to me but no response.

I'm hurt and confused because he went from saying that he appreciated me and could confide in me about anything to completely shutting me out within the span of two months. But mostly I feel guilty because maybe I haven't been as great of a support as I thought. Maybe I'm just annoying him. Maybe I made him feel worse by calling him out on his drug use and actually made it worse. Maybe I'm adding more stress to his life because I fb message him a lot telling him I care and I want to help instead of trying to give him space.


I guess my biggest reason for posting this is I just want to know what's going on in his head. And what I can do/not do. I love this boy and would do absolutely anything in the world for him and it's absolutely killing me that he won't speak to me. I've tried to get a hint about what he's thinking from his social media accounts (twitter, tumblr, even facebook) but he's been inactive on all of them for over a month which is strange for him.

Any insight on what he might be experiencing and what I can do would be great. I hate feeling guilty and I don't want to lose him in any sense of the word. I care about people too much for my own good, and most especially him.

Thank you so much <3 

**TLDR; After going to rehab and telling he appreciates me being there for him and that he can confide in me with anything, he has comletely shut me out and has begun using again. I'm hurt he won't speak to me or open up and I don't know how to help him.**

I'm starting to think that the thin opium coating of the seeds simply becomes suspended in the liquid (as it does settle quickly) instead of entirely dissolving, and in this case, it shouldn't matter.

3y0vr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3y0vr0/seed_abrasion/,27,https://redd.it/3y0vr0,helix19,Seed abrasion,"So I was thinking about PST. The good stuff is on the outside of the seed, and it's best not to consume large amounts of whole seeds. Usually, the seeds are shaken up with water so their surface rubs off. Lemon juice is acidic and chemically removes some of the coating. Different chemicals could probably remove the coating more effectively, but that's not achievable for the average person. At least not without a lot of research and purchasing possible expensive research chemicals. So that brings us back to physical abrasion. Is there anything that could be added (and filtered out if necessary) that would abrade the fuck out of those seeds? I may or may not have tried raw sugar, but that dissolves so obviously it wouldn't have a huge effect. I was thinking graded sand or gravel could be super effective as long as it could be strained off.

So I head there and as I walk up I hear them say man we haven't had anyone today. I say hi and they ask me if I've been there before. I say no and as the woman puts her hand in the box with rigs, dude stops her and says theres nothing they can do for me today, because one of their trucks is missing with ""all the stuff"" in it. I'm like you have rigs right there and he repeats ""There's nothing we can do for you"" louder and angrier. I tell him a white lie which is if I don't get a new rig I'm going to have to share one. He says ""don't try to make me feel bad for trying to not let us get shut down."" I was about to cry honestly so I just walked away. I understand not wanting to get shut down but I was the ONLY person they had so far and it's not like anyone was watching... You'd think someone in that position would have a moral obligation to help me. At least one would hope so. Idk maybe I'm being unfair but it really upset me. What do you think? Am I in the wrong?

I was bored and just felt like typing and talking to people. Loneliness and boredom are definitely my two biggest triggers.

I joined a methadone clinic near my house about 4 months ago (end of July). I work at a special school for students who have either intellectual or emotional disorders... Specifically, I work with troubled kids who have emotional problems; many of them come from some of the worst neighborhoods in the country (Oakland, Fresno, Hayward, etc.). Because of the school holiday schedule, I have this entire week as well as the next one off from work. The first couple days were awesome, but already I'm getting kindof depressed and anxious again, and I wish I could go back to work already. This much time off is very detrimental to my state of being...

So, I decided to pick up some tar earlier today. It was wonderfully easy; I just went to the clinic like I normally do every day anyway, and discreetly asked around until I found someone who could help me. This is my first time using since mid-August. When I first joined the clinic, I was still shooting up for about the first few weeks or so, until finally I got off heroin and was just using methadone. Since then, I've started working full-time at a job that I really love. I am making pretty good money because I get so much overtime-- I work on average about 55-60 hours a week. When I'm working, it's easy for me to not use, because I'm busy doing something that I also really enjoy :).

After successfully cold-copping, the part that drove me SO CRAZY, was getting the rigs. We ended up having to go to FOUR different pharmacies until we found one that would sell needles without a prescription for insulin. It was awful! 

First, we went to a CVS, and they said they couldn't sell me rigs without a prescription of some kind. ugh. Then, we tried Walmart... I had gotten rigs from this specific Walmart before, back in June, and it had worked no problem. But not this time :(. The lady told me that they didn't have any syringes, and that they had been on back-order for a while now. Complete bullshit. How the fuck does a huge WALMART run out of syringes!?? 

After Walmart, we tried a different CVS, and was given the same response as the first one... No rigs without a prescription. However, they did refer me to the Walgreens across the street and said that I might be successful with them. So, annoyed, we made it to the Walgreens. I waited in line, asked for a pack of 29g insulin syringes with 100 units, and... YES FINALLY THANK YOU JUNKIE JESUS!!! But... they asked for my ID to verify I was over 18, and I didn't realize that I had accidentally left it in a different purse of mine, and it was at home :( :( :(. So, they wouldn't let me buy the rigs. I had my friend, who did have her ID with her, get them for me instead, so we wouldn't have to go through the hassle of driving me home to get my ID and then back to the Walgreens. 

SO, after jumping through all the unnecessary hoops, I finally got home with my tar and clean needles. Immediately cooked myself up a little tester shot, and... the rush was AMAZING. Anyway, if you read all this, thanks. I just felt like rambling on a bit :). Have a wonderful Christmas and New Years, all! Please be safe!!!


**TL;DR: Been on methadone since August; off heroin completely since mid-August. Today I impulsively decided to cop and shoot up, with the skewed justification that it's a little Christmas present to myself since I have the next 2 weeks off from work. That's all.**",1450909362.0

Anyway, I found an emergency dental office where for $1 they will at least do imaging and give advice. Here's what a dollar's worth of advice got me: ""yep, that's one fucked up tooth. Get it pulled.""

However, the dollar also got me a script for an antibiotic and pain meds. I explained to the doctor that I'm on suboxone and no, percocet will do absolutely nothing to help me. So, I had him call my Sub Doc.

Sub Doc told him to prescribe me Tramadol and to take it with my suboxone. I was kind of skeptical at first. I knew tramadol is totally synthetic and works differently than other opioids, but I doubted that it would help with the pain (with the bupe having a vice-grip on my receptors.)

However, I took about 300 MG today with 8 MG of Sub, (and 4 MG Clonazepam) and I feel so much better. I actually feel the way I did when I first started eating vicodin when I was about 16.

I've been suicidal for a long time, I've just been waiting for that final push to make me do it and I got that push two days ago.

I was high on a combo of smack, weed and beer when my life went over the edge (don't want to talk about what happened). I had very little time left so I grabbed a bag of smack (enough to OD) and got tbe fuck out of there, I had nowhere to go and was planning on finding a quite spot to kill myself. I was feeling OK about it, I had known this was coming for a long time . But that only lasted for a few minutes before the panic set in. I was terrified, but I knew there was no going back. I kept on trying to reason with myself, to find another way out. I had wanted to die for a long time, I wanted to escape from my pain. But when there was no time left all I felt was the pain, it hit me so hard I felt like I was tripping on a high dose of acid. All I wanted was for everything to be OK, all I wanted was to escape the pain, all I could see was that if I killed myself I would die being consumed by everything I was trying to escape. I couldn't imagine a worse fate for myself, but I had no other options, things could only get worse.

 I kept walking and I passed a house that gave me deja vu. I looked into the front yard and saw a dog. The dog look at me but didn't bark. He walked up to the fence and was looking at me. His behaviour seemed very strange, his tail was relaxed and I just felt like he knew. He just reminded me so much of my dog, it was like as if my dog was communicating through him. I said goodbye and he licked his lips and walked away, and then a cat came out of the bushes behind him and she jumped through a gap in the gate and looked at me for a second before turning around and going back in. I had heard about this kind of thing and I was convinced that my dog and cat had just come to say goodbye.

 I kept running and freaking out. All I wanted was a little more time. More than anything I wanted to see my dog, to make sure he was OK. I was walking towards a park, I wasn't planning on going any further than a few more steps. I looked at the corner up the street and saw a cat sitting there staring at me. It was dark and I couldn't see very well and my vision was insanely warped, but I could've sworn it was my cat. I started to wonder if she had been following me this whole time and I approached her. When I got close she ran across the street (back the way I came) and sat down again. I followed and she kept about 100m ahead of me, leading me down the street towards home before dissapearing into someones house, she wasn't my cat. I kept walking home after that. I had calmed down a bit and I realized that I still had time. I wanted things to get better, and nothing could be worse than not having time to do that.

I might finish this later, I need a break. I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still here and I'll always remember no matter how bad things get, at least there's still time to do something about it, until there isn't.",1451052064.0

Some of you know me. I was very active for like 6 months, then went to rehab, got out 3 weeks ago exactly. Relapsed after 9 days out, despite doing daily meetings and shit. That relapse lasted 7 days because my family caught up and because they're letting me live here and eat their food and all for free, it was a huge violation from their perspective. They also found out that I wasn't snorting painkillers, rather I was injecting heroin into my arm so that was understandably troubling for them to find out so shortly after rehab.

Anyhow, I haven't used dope in 5 days. I had one sub film and did a rapid taper, down to 0.5mg / day and jumping off that tomorrow. Don't expect much WD at all, given that my dope habit was only 7 days long and I did a sub taper.

But Jesus fucking Christ do I want to do a shot. When I was sharing in an AA meeting, they asked me how my relapse was expecting me to say I didn't even enjoy it, but fuck no. I truly loved every shot I did. For some reason, I didn't get any of the self hate I used to get or descend into hopeless or anything. I think this is probably because of all of the spiritual (but purely atheistic) growth I underwent in rehab and through my time out.

Because of the relapse, I've agreed with my parents that I can't leave the house alone, period. Also that I'll get drug tested every 3-4 days. And they also have access to my online banking now.

So I'm pretty much fucked in terms of my ability to get high. But I still feel like I'm just waiting until things start to look good again, until I demonstrate that I'm on the right path and can be granted a tiny bit of trust again, so that I can fuckin gun it to my nearest dope dispenser and put that beautiful medicine in my veins.

People with months of clean time, does this burning desire ever go away? I actually do enjoy sobriety to some extent and have hope that I can live a fulfilling life for once and am not nearly as depressed as I was before rehab, but I just love getting high on heroin so fucking much. What to do? Any suggestions?

Sorry for the rambling post, I just needed to share this bc keeping it inside fucks me up. Thanks everyone, I love you guys.",1451019377.0

I'm sorry this is so incredibly long. I just really need to get this off my chest and I wanted to have something to look back on in the future if I ever get an urge to do these again. 

I've only been using for about 2 months, but I've gotten to the point where I'm taking anywhere from 80-140 mg a day. My boyfriend and I both use and decided a 4 day weekend off from work would be the best time to quit. We have no money left and no way to get more, so that's helping a little bit also. We both WANT to quit. We are tired of the habit and tired of never having money to do anything. I've never gone through this before, he has. I researched online the wd symptoms and I know it's going to be extremely hard. If anyone can share any tips or advice I'd appreciate it greatly. 

It started as him having a very small problem with them and I had a backache. I had done oxy when I was a teenager, but was never addicted. I snorted one and I was in bliss. I've loved it ever since, progressing in my use quite fast. A couple days ago I finally broke down. I felt lost. I had no money and I was in so much pain while I was driving home from work on my lunch break to go do a couple lines. I just started crying while driving because I don't know how I let myself get here. I wanted to call my mom and confess everything, but I knew even she could not help me. I just wanted fast forward time and so I could be clean again. I sat in my boyfriends lap and cried. We then both decided it was definitely time to stop. We have spent probably about $8,000(ish) on pills in the last 2 months. We could have done so much with that money to permanently benefit our lives. It's so crazy that I'm here. 

We have only been together for 3 months and half the time pretty much we've been addicted. I'm afraid of how quitting will affect our relationship. I'm afraid I'll be boring to him or he will be boring to me. I'm afraid our personalities won't match as well as they do. I'm so in love with him and I don't want any of that to change. I don't know how much the pills affect him and in what way besides our sex life.. It's been a while. Neither of us have any drive while using, so that'll be one thing to look forward to. 

I'm just kind of ranting now, so I guess I will end this here. 

Tl;dr: Started using Percocet, got too far into it, have no money. Afraid of the pain and afraid of how it will affect my relationship with my boyfriend. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated.

I live in NJ, so its pretty easy for me to find cheap dope. Yesterday I payed $85 for half a brick (2.5 bundles/25 stamps) of some generously sized bags of fire ECP. I think that this is a pretty solid deal, considering the fact that I was paying $50 a bundle for lower quality dope before meeting this connect. 

I live ~15 minutes from Paterson, and I met my current dboy by simply driving around near Rosa Parks Blvd. I was surprised at how easy it was for someone completely unfamiliar with P-town to find dope - I was in and out of the city in half an hour. I cold copped 3 times, and got good shit every time. As for other drugs, its very hit or miss. You'll find lots of people willing to sell you coke/crack in Paterson, but very few street dealers have good product. You need to know someone or get lucky cold copping. I'm fortunate enough to have a pretty good coke hookup, and I pay $60-$70 per gram of very clean coke. 

Lately I've been copping a bun a day, for either $40 if I go pick it up, or $50 to have it delivered. The $10 delivery fee is steep for a 10 minute ride, but I usually do that when I'm at work and I can't go cop for several hours. Dude walks right into the store I work at as if he's a customer, and I help him ""find what he's looking for,"" which tends to be in a secluded area near the back of the store lol. But I digress.

Happy almost Xmas eve! I hope everyone is treating themselves to start their holidays or celebrating with friends/family.

I want to apologize in advance since I know most of these questions could be answered fairly quickly with some searches, but 

1) I'm kinda busy trying to catch a nod :)  , and
2) I think the combination of these questions may bring up some subjective discussion or yield some facts/opinions/reasoning that may answer questions a lot of people here might have.

I haven't IV'd before so I haven't really messed with H much (I just tend to gravitate toward oxy or dil when I can afford). As a result, there are a lot of basic things about heroin specifically I have been wondering; they can best be summed up as: what is the reasoning for price differences between various types/forms of H, and does it make sense?

Q1: At first, I thought #4 heroin = ecp, but I've seen people here say that #4 can be in the form of powder OR bth, so what exactly makes #4 heroin #4 heroin?

Q2: Follow-up question: I'm pretty sure you can't just snort #3 H right out of the bag since it requires adding some citric acid to create some sort of reaction that yields #4 (not sure if this is right, but I think that's what I remember reading). So my question is, is #3 heroin only cheaper than #4 heroin just because more work is involved in prepping it? How would you compare the difficulty of converting #3 -> #4 H to doing a simple cold water extraction on some vicodin? (By prep, I don't just mean an IV, also talking about just making it intranasal). Or is it cheaper because it's much lower quality? If #3 is cheaper since it requires more work to use, is the conversion process really so difficult that it explains such a big price gap between #3 and #4 heroin? (Again, this is just what I've heard or read about pricing, but it seems like #4 is more expensive across the board). If #3 is cheaper because it's straight up shittier, how so? Is it so much worse that it's not worth it for the price cut?

Q3: Why is there such an enormous price difference between BTH and ECP? Personally, I just think BTH looks gross and I wouldn't want that goo in my body (not judging any BTH lovers, just expressing my own naive view), but I have a feeling this is not the only reason. Is tar lower quality? Is it less potent than ecp in nature and consequently requires an amount higher enough than ecp that the prices would even out? 

I realize that last question was worded horribly, my b. To give an example, how much black tar would you need to buy to get the equivalent of 1g of ecp, assuming both forms are decent-to-high quality?

I think those were all the questions I had, but I'm feelin a bit too good to be confident about that... happy nodding!",1450988196.0

   Last night around 11 I went go get some last minute things for tomorrow  (cards, small stocking stuff ya know the usual) after that I go home to tuck my girlfriend into bed and sit with her until she fell asleep  (she starts her new promotion today, Is now the manager of her own Spencers.)

After she fell asleep I get ready to go too my mom's house  (I stashed all of the gifts there) roll a few smokes take a few hits off my tray and set out too go get the gifts. 

I get to my mom's house and open the garage which Is kinda loud especially when it's cold. So I leave it open cause I don't want too wake up her or my stepfather  (they both work early hours) from opening and shutting it over and over. So I go get the presents which are in a couple of big bags cause I was going to wrap them when I got home, and take them outside into the garage thinking they will be fine (12ish at this point, figured everyone is either asleep or at home hanging with family or whatever). So I go back inside to grab my water bottle and take a piss real quick, while I'm in the bathroom I heard a car door shut, I didn't think anything of it figuring it was neighbors or something. So I Finnish up and go outside and bam MOTHER FUCKING BAGS ARE GONE!!!! 
    Some fuck head must have been watching me or just happened to drive by and see bags full of stuff and decided that they had to fuckin have them for themselves. So now no one is going too have anything from me to unwrap tomorrow.
   I  ended up calling my girlfriend waking her up to tell her what happened and as soon as she answered the phone I started bawling my eyes out, we talked for a minute and she asked me to come home. The whole drive home I couldn't stop crying. She was sill up when I got back sitting in bed.  I crawled into bed and cried and cried, the whole time she was trying to comfort me. So that's what my night was and I really hope whoever stole all of the gifts I had gotten is real happy with themselves and can go die. 
    Sorry for the wall of text just needed to get that out. 

Tldr: had Christmas gifts, left in open garage for about two minutes while pissing inside come back out and there gone.

Happy fucking holidays yall.

What factor(s) pushed it over the edge?,"Been thinking back on my using days a lot lately. Was thinking back to when it all started, to when I could use without getting sick, and to when every time I used it was an all around amazing feeling.

Somehow, someway I had 3 years of fun with opiates before it got dark. At that point it was the occasional Vicodin script scammed off of doctors, or even more occasional Opium that my friend would bring back from Iran in his butt hole.

Step one to pushing it over the edge was catching my fiancé at the time in the process of cheating. That mentally broke me up really bad. Step two was after we split gaining access to a dealer who had Morphine and Oxy on a regular basis. 

Was a nice 3 year run though. Probably the last time in my life that everything felt new and full of possibilities. ",1450975765.0
3y3fs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3y3fs6/something_i_wrote/,3,https://redd.it/3y3fs6,troublewill,Something I wrote...,"Been a long year, GF of few years found out about my addiction. I've been clean, relapsed, got clean, and relapsed again. Right now I am the deepest into it I've ever been. I wrote this one high night when I needed to do something to ease the pain. I am not a good writer. To preface this, after my gf found out about my addiction she decided to give me a chance to get clean. At the time I was willing (though maybe not 100% dedicated). I moved in with her since she lives with her parents to take care of them. She nursed me for a while and then one day I decided I'd move back home....

""How do you feel?"" she asks so simply. ""I'm feeling okay, a little better than yesterday"". Such a simple question deserved such a simple response. Yet I knew the true answer wasn't so simple. It has been 13 days since she found out about my addiction. It has been 10 days since my last taste. My legs have calmed a bit. Yawning has subsided. The hot & cold flashes have eased.  I can finally sleep more than 3 hours, but every night consists of a dreams filled with pills and powders. I wake up wishing I could go back to sleep. 

It is March, the cold is leaving the air, but the cozy warmth of an opiate buzz is entering my mind. ""I'm off to work, do you need me to get you anything on my way home?"" I've put her through so much bullshit in the last few weeks, and all she ever thinks about are ways to help me. ""No babe, I'll be okay, have a great day, I love you."" We kiss. She's been practically nursing me these last few weeks. She's taken off from work & spent money she doesn't have to help me get through this. I hear the front door close. 

I sit in the ambiance of my computer. I can hear car doors slamming and birds chirping outside. Normal people are getting ready for their day. I'm not a normal a person anymore. I used to be. The youthful, sober me would wake up at 5am, put on some tunes, go for a run, lift weights. That is not today. Today I need to find a way to make the hours pass. 

About halfway into my addiction my father told me, ""If you don't stop this stuff, it'll cost you everything."" I heard it, I knew it, but who cares? Interlaced between the rest of your life falling apart are those fleeting minutes when opiates make you feel like you've made the right choice. I pounded back the rest of my gatorade, popped in a dip, and turned the TV on. Nothing was on. “What productive thing could I do today?” I thought to myself. Let's head to the gym. Exercise would be a good idea. I should go to a meeting first though. No...how about I plan my relapse instead...

Here I am, ten months later. I've thought about that day everyday since then. It might be when I wake up. It might be during work. It could be while I'm falling asleep. It might even be in a dream...but in some fashion I have literally thought about that day everyday for eight months. That was the day I decided to pack up my stuff and move back to my parents. I sincerely believe that on my deathbed I will still think of that day. While I was still able to stay clean for another few weeks, it was a big decision that ultimately lead to my relapse, and the loss of the love of my life.

I wish I was making this up, but I have had a dream about her almost every night since we split. Is this normal? Am I going crazy? Sometimes the dreams are happy, sometimes they're sad. A lot of the dreams consist of her and I fixing our problems, reliving the happiest times of my life. Others are sexual, sometimes angry, but in some form I've dreamt of her continually. I've been in broken relationships before. I've been through emotional states before, but nothing matches this. 

You see, on top of a broken heart, I am going through another troubling relationship with heroin. Usually, the best times of my life or the times when I felt the strongest were a few weeks after a relationship had ended. I would use the pain to motivate myself. This time has been different. I simply am defeated.

Seriously WTF and there was no buses running in the morning. So if you had work you where fucked and would have to get a taxi which are double time . Waited at the bus stop for a bus that never came so thought fuck it I'll just hop on my push bike and go into town as I was soaked anyway . So I go back to my bit , get the bike and head into town. As I was going by the bus stop one of my friends was waiting at it . So I stopped and asked if there was one due and he said there was and he showed me a Xmas bus time table and one was due right now at 12.06 so thought fuck it and stashed by bike in the bushes behind the bus stop and the bus was on form 😄 And was a good 10 minutes late and packed with ppl . My friend was saying his work wanted him to come in but he refused as it would have cost him money as he would have had to pay £30 to get in or maybe a bit more depending on the traffic . As the taxis are dbl time . Get of at Tesco and phone my man . Had to pay £120 for the 1/8th 😒 But said the next one I got he would do for a hundred . Went back up to tescos and got some tabbacco as last night I ended up having to break up old roll ups out the ash tray as nothing was open . Had a quick charge in the toilets . Then went over to McDonald's n got a cpl of dbl cheese burgers and a drink and started walking towards town . Meet one of my neighbours that had to walk/jog into the town this morning (abt 4miles) and had been waiting for over an hour to get the bus back home . I told him there should be a bus leaving the bus garage at 1:05pm and would be due any minute and right enough 5 min later it came and my friend that I got the bus in with was on it as well. The game he was wanting to buy metal gear solid for xbone wasn't on sale or reduced so he ended up not getting a game . 
   Got of the bus and I went to the us stop and sure enough my bike was there and no one had pinched it :) 
  Got home and cooked up a nice big hit :) http://imgur.com/a/HXATu it was like syrup ! And dam what a rush ! maybe a little stupid but fuck it YOLO ! Lol plus I've got naloxon and someone is in that could have given it to me if the worst had happened .

I didnt think much of this as I usually get 3 for 200. anyways....

So I go and meet him up around 4 o'clock when I get to ""his"" house, he comes up to my car and says ahhh shit dude, I just weighed out what I have and only have a G. I should have just fucked off and went home at that point. He then asked me if I could drive him to re-up which is about 30 minutes away, and that he had just spoken to his guy. I was hesitant at first, but agreed after a moment of thought.

Now we are driving to his guy and he keeps trying to call him with my phone, since his can only be used over wifi(a point that would later fuck me) and his guy isnt answering. But he reassures me that he will answer by the time we get there. 10 minutes.... no answer.... 20 minutes.... no answer.... 30 minutes we are there and still no fucking answer. At this point it is around 4:45 and I tell him that I have to be home to eat christmas dinner with my family around 6. So he blows his guy's phone up trying to reach him and still no answer. I tell him that if he doesnt answer by 5:20 I have to leave. Of course the guy doesnt answer and we leave I drop him off and tell him I can probably meet up later.

He texts me and says he got a hold of his other guy, and that he can still do the 4 grams. But the price is also now 225 instead of 200(another red flag now that I think of it) I say ok and ask when to meet up, he says in 45 minutes. I wait 20 minutes and head out toward his house. I get in the neighborhood and then he texts me saying the guy is still 20 minutes away. So I fuck off and go sit at a gas station for a bit.

He finally texts me that his guy is there, I race over there. He comes out of his shit hole house and comes to my car, greets me, and holds out his hand. I (without thinking, I was pretty tired) hand him my money. He just grabs it, doesnt count it, and says I""ll brb. and goes and hops in the guys car which is parked in front of mine. 

They speed off as soon as he is in the car, and I say to myself Oh Fuck. I knew just by the way the fucking guy drove away that I was screwed. I waited for 45 minutes repeatedly trying to text and call him but since his phone is wifi only he isnt getting any of this, and I can only leave messages on his answering machine.

I'm not sure how to proceed at this point. Im sitting here typing this and trying to get high on the resin from my tooters. Guess Ill be taking what I have left of my money and going to my normal guy tommorow. :/ People are shady.",1451120256.0

So none of my dealers were working, sort of cold copped and the stuff ended up being junk, there goes $20 :( calls me again, he got new shit, the freeloader just gave him $60 without even looking at the bags!

Dude explains he's new to the H game, i told him the bag he gave me goes for like $15, so now I got a cheap af hook up and all the other local junkies will be thanking me for those cheap ass bags.

I don't abuse them even, but I've noticed with the white pills I have to take 20mg just to feel ANY relief. Where as with the yellows I could 10 and 15 gave amazing relief.

I just have a quick question for you guys. 
Those who are generally happier than sad, how do you do it? The reason I shoot dope is because 1) I'm addicted and 2) It's the only consistent thing in my life that always does the same thing: numb me. I've gotten clean before, mainly because I couldn't afford it anymore. I've never stolen to support my addiction. The first drug (besides alcohol and tobacco) I did was h. I moved down to pills (mainly norcs and oxy) and I always go back to h because pills are just so expensive. I have a job. I work 6 days a week waiting tables. It's great because it's money day and no drug tests. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say my age but I'm under 21 and over the age of 19. I've been to a psych ward 4 times for suicidal attempts. Slit wrists. DOA the last time. I have a couple 7"" long scars on my left arm from it. I've been to rehab a couple of times. Tried methadone, suboxone and cold turkey. I've found that the only way to get clean longer than a month is to actually want it and have other supports. I've been shooting since I was 13. My best friend,  who died last year on the 18th from a car accident, introduced me to the drug. I've gone to jail for possession, assaulting her ex who used to hit her, intent to distribute, D&D. Wait, I mean drunk and disorderly. I don't like driving under the influence, my cousin was killed by a drunk driver. Drinking and driving does kill. I'm not going to preach to someone on how to live their life, but if you're going to get fucked up, please to endanger other people's lives. Anyways, I have no goals or motivation to get another job. I got my license taken away and I take the bus everyday to work which is about an hour one way. I'm not happy by any means, but I'm a little content. I make enough to pay rent, my phone bill,  and my addiction. It gets me through the day. Sorry for the long post, no one talks to me much and it's nice to get it out. I'm sure no one will read this but if you do, thank you and if you want someone to talk to I'll be here. Merry Christmas.",1451088304.0

I grabbed a bag of dope from my connect who always has garbage, and I did the whole 40 bag (probably about a .4 .5) in one line (per usual, my usual dose, and my ROA is intranasal, I've never IV'ed). It tasted awful. I couldn't quite put my finger on the taste. Im guessing it was a tiny bit of heroin, with alot of nasty cut, and a good amount of fentanyl because I FELL OUT!. Ive never fallen out from dope before. Even when in the past when ive made terrible choices of mixing opiates and benzos. This was the only time I truly feared for my life.

If I were an IV user I'd probably be dead. Please be safe, and I'm sorry if I broke the rules.

Edit: Wow, I completely forgot to add that a buddy of mine OD'ed and was brought back to life with Narcan from the same connect about a week ago. His ROA is also snorting. It slipped my mind because this specific connect of mine is a super last resort, as the quality is always very shitty. The worst out of about 5 people I know.

I got some gift cards for Christmas from some work shit and some family etc. My plug doesn't take them so I was looking for an outlet. 

I put mine up on Craigslist. Posted them at 9am for 85% of their face value. Got some low ball offers initially but my bottom line was 75%. My target customer is not someone looking to make a buck and buy them from me at 50%, but someone who's going to use it. If this had t worked, I was going to that store where the cards are from and sell them in the parking lot. 

Best advice I got about selling things is ""don't be desperate"". I held off until about 2pm and got my asking price and all my stuff. Quick and in cash. 

Bonus: I put a little sappy story about how I need the money for surgery (which I do need), and some sweet old lady who bought one of my cards asked me if I was in pain? I told her yes and she gave me a handful of 10mg Vicodin hahah. 

My point here is if you can, hold out until you get the right offer. I live in a small city and I had no problem at all getting my asking price. However, took about ~6ish hours.


Ninja Edit; there is defiantly some info in here. Good luck to anyone who is trying to move some gift cards.

Everyone knows the heat to golden brown technique , also the iso extract technique. I kinda mixed them. 
I tried the the alcohol extraction by itself. But the pill wouldn't desolve in the alc.


YOU NEED 91% ALCOHOL FOR THIS TO WORK.
So I started by taking coating off then dicing it into as many little pieces as possible via razorblade. Put them in a dry spoon. Heat them over stove. Till they are golden brown. Insert them into a shot glass with enough alcohol to cover all the peices what 10 minutes or so until the pieces. Have gotten smaller. You will notice only the golden brown part of the pill will dissolve into the alcholol leaving you with white pill chunks in the alcohol.

Here you will remove the pill chunks from the alcohol. Put them back in a dry spoon and reheat them over the stove until they become golden brown maybe a little bit darker.  

Now put the pieces  back into the alcohol. And wait till the golden brown dissolves again. And repeat as many times as needed till the pill dissolves. 
Now add alcohol to a larger spoon. 
Add heat and evaporate the alcohol till there is no liquid left. From here its just like your normal iso extract. Add water, stir,. I know this process probably wastes a little product but its totally worth it",1451084265.0

1) I know this probably goes better in /r/drugs, but you guys are a lot nicer community and probably deal with issues like this more than the average acid user/pot smoker on /r/drugs.

2) Also, I know I shouldn't take anything in this thread as proper medical advice and just see a doctor if I'm worried...but I'm curious about people's opinions and experiences relating to nasal damage.

Anyway, here's my issue. I've been having nosebleeds and huge nose clots for about a week, week and a half now. Obviously it's from doing drugs. I've only ever gotten a nose bleed from snorting something once (ritalin once as a teen), and believe you me, I've stuck just about fucking everything up my nose, from vicodin to benzos (I know, kill me now, I was a dumb teenager, I know better now).

I tried ethylphenidate a week or two ago. It's a Ritalin RC analogue that's known for being superrrr caustic on the nose. After one use, these nosebleeds started. I'm not the only person that has reported nasal fuck ups from doing ethyl just once. Me being the dumbass I am, decided to snort ethyl again a few days later, but I was at least much more careful about it (lots of saline nasal rinses). This time it didn't seem to make the problem any worse, actually. Although I'm still not going to snort ethyl again period.

I've been snorting other junk in the meantime. Mainly other RC stimulants. a-PHP is one. Heroin a few times. They seem to be drugs that can burn/hurt your nose, but not horribly. But since I have the damage from the ethyl I'm pretty sure I'm keeping my nose in a fucked up place by doing more and more of these other drugs.

Obviously, the smart answer would be to STOP SNORTING SO MUCH GOD DAMMIT SHIT. But, I am not the smartest when it comes to these things. (Maybe smartest is not the right word. Not the most responsible, at least.) Y'all know how it goes.

Has anyone had serious nosebleeds/blood clots from snorting drugs, whether they're opiates or not? When did you decide it was serious enough to go to a doctor for or cut back on your usage? Anyone know of some warning signs that I may be doing SERIOUS damage? (I can live with some nosebleeds for awhile...I don't want to actually burn a hole in my nose though).

Any harm reduction advice would be so appreciated...you guys are a lovely community...thank you so much. xoxo",1451212192.0

I've been captivated by this sub for the last few weeks and finally decided to join in. I am very much a nerd in real life. My interests include sciences, math, music (big time hip-hop fiend), literature, philosophy, and drugs. Altering my state of mind has fascinated me since I first got drunk around age 13. Since then I've become a regular drinker, stoner, psychedelic enthusiast, went through an MDMA craze (miss those times before my connects dried up, though it is probably better for my brain in the long run), and mild user of benzos and stimulants. However my experiences with opiates rank among the top few in my drug pantheon. 

Being a naturally hyped person and insomniac, stimulants were never really a perfect fit for me. I do enjoy an occasional line of adderall or coke, but any more than that causes too much anxiety and sleeplessness to be enjoyable. Downers, however, have always been good to me. They bring down my natural energy down to a point where I can just sit back and enjoy a very pleasant high while the stress of my intense day melts away. I have also noticed that I seem to have a stronger natural tolerance to the effects of depressants than most of my friends. Be it alcohol or benzos or opiates, I can typically remain lucid and avoid blacking or nodding out on doses that have my friends floored. Being coherent and conscious makes the high all the more enjoyable and contributes greatly to my preference for this group of drugs.

I have, however, noticed some addictive tendencies in my use. In September I went on a benzo binge where I was popping several mgs of Xanax and K-pin close to every day. It began with taking a bar occasionally to unwind after a long day, but was quickly progressing into worrying territory. Luckily I started thinking about my use during an acid trip and something clicked in my head and I went and flushed my stash of benzos. I didn't suffer any w/d except trouble sleeping for a few nights, but I really feel like I dodged a bullet there. I have taken benzos since then but am now extremely cautious in planning my use since I realized that bad habits can creep up very unexpectedly.

For this reason I am also double cautious when it comes to opiates, since I know I enjoy them more and they can also creep up on me in the same way. Throughout my drug use I have always thought it very important to not let drugs take the front stage in front of the rest of my life. I come from a poor immigrant family and have pretty much had to build up my life and my future from scratch. At this point I have put too much effort into building up my bank account, getting into a good college, finding a major I really like, making connections with future employers, and finally getting into a long-term relationship with a very pretty girl to risk losing it all over getting high. And I definitely know I can lose all those things if I don't watch myself.

Opiates are, however, very very nice :) I do not have a consistent source for strong opiates and would wish for it to stay that way. However when any of my friends is willing to share a few pills I waste no time in sending them up my nostrils. When my roommate got a script for 60 Perc 10s earlier in the semester we went through the bottle within 2 weeks (we both had no tolerance so 2 pills and some bud would get us flying). I realized that pills had a very strong pull over me so since then the only opiate I have consumed is bottles of Codeine-Promet syrup obtained from me or one of my friends faking a cough at our very generous university health center. I think I might have a strong codeine metabolism or something (I read that that was a thing for some people. If anyone knows I would greatly appreciate an explanation.) because 1.5 ounces of syrup mixed into Sprite (around 90mg codeine) can get me very high and euphoric.

I trust myself around the syrup since it is relatively mild and makes use easy to control. However I think the nurses have started to get a bit worried about my repeated complaints of a persistent cough and at my last visit they said I should go for a chest X-ray and further tests if the ""cough"" returned again. I really do not wish to get involved in that hustle so am cut off from that source for the time being. Do any of y'all have any suggestions on how to occasionally get a mild opiate buzz while keeping the risks to an absolute minimum? If not I guess I'll just have to wait a while until the nurses chill out and I can go back again an say ""Yeah, it went away for like 4 months but then I got sick and it stated bothering me again."" Either way is fine with me but getting high would obviously be nice :)

Cheers and best holiday wishes!",1451195615.0

I'm a server at a restaurant. Been there for 3 years. Was in the army for a year before getting a psych discharge. New girl, call her Sarah, started about a week ago. Find out she uses. Primarily IV. The past few days she would constantly ask for money and squares and dope. I was starting to get annoyed because she was using me. Oh, she's drop dead gorgeous too. So today she came in and told me she had something for me. A $50 bag! It's greyish blue but it's pretty fire. She hands it to me and kissed me on the cheek. Oh, I'm about 6'3, beard, 200 lbs and tattoos. She has a bunch too. We end up taking the bus home together. She kissed me again while waiting for it. Turns out she's only 5 miles away from me (we live about 15-20 miles away from work) so I asked my roommate to borrow her car to take her home. We went to my house and she shot up. I didn't because I wanted to drive safe. I had snorted some an hour prior and was feeling good but not nodding. She started making out with me in my room! I couldn't believe it. This beautiful girl is making out with me and isn't using me! We copped some on the way to her house. Blasting kendrick in the car. I pulled into her apt. and she tells me to pull in the back because she didn't want her boyfriend to see. See what? She gets on top of me and we go at it!

He gets in my car and says as an xmas present he put an extra point in my bag and then gave me a half point of crystal to go with it! Then he asked for a ride to his next customer since it was on my way home, so I tell him sure. We do the deal no problem and I drive him to his place. As soon as I pull over for him to get out, he hands me a bag with .2 and tells me merry xmas. Shortly after, he texts me saying that the rest of my xmas present is in the passenger seat cup-holder of my car. I look and it's the tooter he uses to smoke dope and crystal, I look closer and its CAKED with both dope and clear!!!

Has anybody else gotten any kind of drugs from their dealer for xmas?  Or perhaps anything else?

TL;DR - I hit up my dealer expecting the fact that he was hooking up a $30 bag for me to be my xmas present. Ended up getting .6 of dope, .05 of crystal, and a tooter completely CAKED with both dope and crystal, all for $30 as a xmas gift from my dealer!!!",1451186991.0

So I am going to be traveling to another state really soon, and I will be flying there. I insufflate my Oxymorphone, and I'm just trying to figure out how I am going to work this out... Apparently razor blades are not allowed on the plane. So this means that I will be unable to scratch the coating off and crush my G72s when I arrive in the state that I am traveling to. Also, I'm not sure if I will be able to bring the baking soda on the plane that I cut the oxymorphone with. So if this is the case, then it looks like I will have to prepare the oxymorphone for insufflation here, and somehow package it to get through the TSA. How the hell am I supposed to do this? I was thinking about finding some sort of supplement that comes in gel capsules, like fiber capsules. This way, I can empty a couple out and put the prepared OM in. Should I do this? Should I put it in my carry on bag, or my checked luggage? Would they open the bottle? If they do this, then they would notice that some capsules have a different colored powder. Before someone says it, no butt things. That is off limits. Any help here?

EDIT: I also have an Rx only nasal spray that has a volume of around 16.5ml. I emptied it out, and it now dispenses an Oxymorphone solution. Is this okay to bring through the TSA? Checked luggage or carry on? Ughhh. Sorry for all of the questions, but as you can probably tell, I've never had to do this before.

EDIT 2: Okay, so the only supplements that I have in my possession at the moment are fiber and Valerian capsules. The fiber capsules are impossible to pull apart without damaging them becuase of a seal that keeps them closed. The Valerian comes apart, but the capsules are delicate and keep ripping.

A couple days after i had asked him if he would return the favor and throw me some love (i didnt charge him for the connect and some people want like 100 bucks or more to come off a connect). He said he couldnt ATM bc he was out of town with family until today, but promised me he would take care of me when he got back in town. Now i generally never believe a fellow users word and expected nothing to happen, but i hit him up today to see what was up and within 20 min i had a few bags of some diesel in tow!!

I have a 6mg Hydromorph with me now. I haven't done one since I started the suboxone. Does suboxone kill the high? Will I get sick if I take The hydro? What if I take the hydro and then go get my dose of suboxone tomorrow? Will I be sick then? 

I know I had to be in withdraw to start the suboxone, so I'm just wondering how this will work. Again this will be the only hydromorph I've done since I started the suboxone and I don't plan on doing more than the 6mg.

---

I've never felt so alone. What a great irony it is to be in a city filled with people, millions of people, all packed together like sardines in a can... and yet be so completely, so wholly, so utterly alone.

I never used to care. I always felt content existing in my own little microcosm... friends, girlfriends, etc. were always secondary. But now I'm hundreds of miles from anyone who gives half of a fly fisherman's fuck about me, and now the chains of solitude hang heavy on my shoulders. The weight often feels too great to bear.

xxxxxxxx

I've replaced real human experiences with the selfish warmth of a dopamine surge, a biochemical kiss, a temporary bliss. A twisted smile before a shot... feeling fine when I am not. 

From an outside perspective, to my family, I'm doing better than ever. Not quite 2x years old with a lucrative job at a xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx company. My own place xxxxxxxx. Personal trainer. Health insurance. I should feel lucky.

But it's all fucking meaningless to me. Why work so hard making money when it's all to prop up a life that is hardly worth sustaining in the first place? I've tried to numb myself with arrogance but it doesn't work... It's fucking sad that I derive most of the meaning in my life from being a high-performer at work and getting high before, during and after. 

I can feel the heroin slowly washing away my emotions, wiping away the things that used to define me. Even empathy, my most prized possession, sometimes feels like it's fading. It's actually not really heroin that's doing it though... it's the circumstances surrounding it. The emptiness. The solitude. The inherent selfishness of pure hedonism. 

I don't know what the point of this post is. I just feel slightly hopeless in a sense... like I cannot escape this feeling of emptiness. Money can buy heroin and heroin is a close structural analogue of happiness, but it isn't the happiness I'm looking for. 

I want the genuine happiness that comes from helping others and doing service for mankind. From real relationships with people. From generosity and compassion and friendship and love.

Basically, long story short, I'm addicted to tramadol. I used to pop whatever pill I could get my hands on for about three years before I developed a problem. I hit some bad lows in my life and for the first time instead of using pills for experimentation, I used them to self-medicate for my severe anxiety and depression. Two years later and I'm an addict.

Oh, sure, it's just tramadol. I'm grateful I've never gotten heavy into oxy's, never done dope or anything harder than oxycodone and that's been awhile. I use kratom in the AM before my daily tram dose, and/or to potentiate. I get my tramadol prescribed to me for chronic pain/fatigue/RLS that all started in the depressive outbreak i mentioned before. But I was never able to get over the hardships life threw at me. Instead, I used the drugs to get me through. 

And here I am, two years later. Every single time, I run out early. Every single time, it's ""this next fill, you've gotta make them last the full 30 days, no more of this."" Every single time, I do it again. 

Usually because there are refills on my script, i guess, and since it's not a CII, they let me refill it after about 23-24 days instead of 30 as long as the insurance lets it go through. Today is day 23. I have one pill left. I called the automated refill line. ""It is too soon to refill your prescription."" Last time it went through on day 23. My mind starts to race. ""Is it my insurance? What if I talked to them? Will they know what I'm really doing with my pills? I need to stop. I need to get clean. Why can't I just stick to kratom? Why can't I just take one or two pills, fuck, even the three I'm prescribed to take, instead of four or five or six? How much longer can I do this?""

I'm feeling the tears build up. It's my saving grace that I'm too chicken to look for pills on the street, or else I'd probably have gotten myself in way too deep by now. I don't know how you guys going through this ""how will I function today?"" every single day do it. It's getting exhausting. I want to stop. I don't know if I can stop alone, without the horrible social ills that being a street junkie provides. If I were buying pills from a dboy, I would have stopped long ago. 

I need help. I don't know where to go. Because the truth? I like to be high. When I have four or five tramadol in my bloodstream, every single thing I deal with every day mentally and physically, it all goes away. I feel like I can write. I can speak, I can sing, I can get a promotion at work and be my district manager's right hand man, I can talk to girls, I can do anything. I couldn't do these things before. I wasn't strong enough. The pills made me stronger and better and what I wanted to be.

Except they also made me the one thing I wouldn't want my worst enemy to be. An addict. ",1451238541.0

My question is how does it benefit the makers and dealers. I feel like Fetnyl is very hard to come by and much less common then normal opiates. Where are they getting all of it to make so many fake pills, and is it that much cheaper to obtain??? Basically people are dying because it's so strong. So your getting a drug that is way more potent for the same price. Seems counter intuitive to me. Or am I totally misunderstanding what's happening??? Hoping someone can clear up my confusion.

I recently decided to take a break from using opioids for a few weeks and after the initial withdrawal symptoms ended, I started taking naltrexone at 50mg per day. I have been doing this for about two weeks or so. My question is, how long should I continue to use naltrexone to completely reset my tolerance. What I mean is, at what point will the law of diminishing returns catch up with my using naltrexone? For example, I do not believe my tolerance would be much more reset if I used naltrexone for three years or three months. I have heard varying reports ranging from one week on naltrexone to a few weeks, and I'm sure initial tolerance plays a factor too. Also, please note that I know what I am doing when it comes to opioids. I won't go off and take a big shot of heroin (I have never used intravenous opioids anyway) At most, a few milligrams of hydrocodone will be the first experimental dose after quitting the naltrexone.",1451397906.0

Better explanation in comments.,"I'm not new to opiates, but most of my experience was from a daily 5-15 bag habit i had for a few years, a few years ago. I'm no stranger to heavy withdrawal; i detoxed in city jail bullpens from that habit, so don't let my question make it seem like i don't understand what real pain can be.


That being said, lately i've been going through a few bags here and there, and for the most part i've been avoiding feeling it when i stop, but I'm trying to gather info on the best strategies for coasting through it if i go too many days at a time and start to feel it. Between the 9 - 5 and the girlfriend, its hard to find a good few days to lay out and get it out of my system. I wasn't on reddit in the past and didn't know many people who used, so i never got a chance to ask around about this stuff. 


Aside from the obvious answer of not being a wimp and just dealing with it, what works for you to come off a short run? Does tapering actually work, assuming you have the self control for it? (For example, shooting 5 bags friday - sat, then saving a 6th bag to split in half (then the other half in half again,) that you would do 24 and 48 hours after the last shot; or some variation of that.) How about Kratom and PST? 

I know bottom line if you use too much, you're brain chemistry is going to be off and there's no way around that, but there still has to be a ""best"" strategy. 

Thanks all.

He has now been using for 3 months straight about a half gram a day. About 2 weeks ago he tried to kick but he caved in towards the end of the first day due to the agony of his withdrawal. He says he has kicked many times before but never after a 3 month long bender. So at this point he has 2 options, kick cold turkey or get on a suboxone program, taper down and then kick. His question is which withdrawal will be worse physically and mentally, cold turkey or suboxone? He knows that suboxone withdrawal over all is worse but is it going to be as bad if he tapers down to the lowest possible dose and then stops or is it going to be about the same as quitting dope cold turkey?

Two years later and I'm a complete addict; luckily highly functional with a job, but could lose anything at any moment. 

I spent the last of my money today on what was supposed to be a quarter and got shorted. The guy was going to cut me a break tonight and give me more for another $$ (last time I checked the rules said no pricing) but when I got to the pawn shop it had been closed for hours ( fucking Internet was totally wrong on their hours). I cried the whole way home (yes, I'm a girl). 

Once I got home I just broke down to my boyfriend. I'm disgusted that these two years have flown by like this with relatively little significant clean time. I came home to my parents house, the home I grew up in, with dope. On fucking Christmas. At least last year I was on subs and thought it was abhorrent to bring that in to my home. Just goes to show how far I've come...and the thought of work tomorrow while I'm sick just terrifies me. I didn't even have the control to save myself a morning shot. 

I can't take the ups and downs anymore, I really can't. And my entire paycheck being gone within days. I disgust myself. I never thought this would happen to me, and losing friends who were once close is especially hard. At this point, if I let things get any worse before they get better I'll be dealing with some pretty significant losses that I'm not sure I could recover from. For example, my boyfriend, the love of my life. I can't let it get there. My job, the best salary I've ever had. I mean, I'd gladly lose my job before the love of my life but I spent the better half of last year unemployed and I'm trying to make a point. 

It's so easy to keep telling myself I'll get clean later & that I'm still young enough to be doing this, but it feels like just yesterday I was 23 and 25 just came out of nowhere. I thought I'd be in graduate school by now or doing something more impressive. 

But it's hard to stay clean when being high just feels so much better. Those first few days, even on subs, are unbearable. I'd often rather be dead just to escape the crippling depression and the feeling in my body like I've aged about 70 years. Then I figure I've done so much damage at this point that it's irreversible and I'm just fucked. And the cycle continues. 

So I'll turn it to all of you- how did you do it? What was your breaking point? How did you stay clean, and how much longer until you felt normal, and then happy? What made it worth it? Not to be cynical, but I hear so much bullshit about being clean sometimes. I'm not about to renounce God but that can't be the focus for me. The generic motivations I hear from doctors and other professionals just makes me distrust people and call bullshit. 

I used to be so happy, the littlest things made my day. I want to be that person again, but I don't know how. I needed to get this out, thanks to anyone who listened. ",1451355711.0

I was just in there last month for pneumonia, damn it!

Anyways, I think the first ER nurse assumed I was a meth IV user? My Grandma went with me, as I'm here visiting for the holidays. And she agreed the nurse was acting very odd, and agreed to my suggestion as to why. Now, my Grandma is very anti-drug, about as staunch as one gets.

My BP/Pulse were high and I hadn't slept because of the holiday/insomnia. I also tend to self medicate my ADHD and depression with caffeine (better than opanas and h...amirite?). I'm naturally hard to stick, but it was even worse this time because the nurses wrecked my arms a month ago during my stay. I mean, one literally blew 3 veins trying to put in an IV while showing a CNA how to use the IV infrared gun thing.

Anyways, the nurse stuck me ONCE in the right arm after looking at the left and not going in. But, she didn't seem to feel around for a vein? It's almost like she just shoved it in blindly. And she shoved it in with enough fucking force to do this bruising with a single attempt : http://i.imgur.com/2PqDSQL.jpg .

I've never had anything like this happen before at a hospital. I've never done Meth. I've been clean from ops for 3 months now. And, I never IV'd in my arms, either. I've also never had anyone go in that position for a first try? Every single other person I encountered in this hospital was a fucking TREAT. Which is what made this so odd.

Hey there y'all. I'm using a throwaway because...well, frankly, I'm ashamed. I think we all know how that feels. But yeah, here's the deal. I have Fentanyl, and it's enough to last me until the 4th when my shit gets refilled, but I'm out of my breakthrough meds. Weirdly enough I was doing fine for about the first week with no breakthrough, but for some reason for the last few days I've been getting awful on-and-off nausea. It's literally the only ""withdrawal"" symptom I get, maybe some restless arm stuff thrown in there every so often (although I get that shit anyway so I have no idea if that is what is going on), but mainly it's the fuckin' nausea. The Fentanyl is still taking care of my pain too!

It's just this goddamn nausea. And it is indeed the kind of nausea you feel when your body is low on meds. I have no idea why this is happening, and I'm currently trying to get in with a new doctor who I plan on asking why the f*ck that happens, when everything else feels peachy keen but I still feel like throwing up, but until then I need a plan.

So...yeah. Would Loperamide help with that? I'm just looking for something to help ease off that nauseous feeling. It won't interfere with the painkilling properties of the Fent, right?

**TL;DR: Would Loperamide help stave off the nausea part of withdrawals? It's the only part of WD's I'm feeling, and that I have been feeling on and off the past few days. Will it interfere with my Fentanyl? Any other anti-nausea tricks?**",1451337146.0

It just turned into a bit of a wall of text and earned its own thread. 

I have been debating with myself which is better, real happiness and real sadness but without control, this twisted happy....


I have bipolar and get manic episodes followed by crazy downs. I would make serious life changes during the highs at first this was working in my favor and I would hop jobs make more money maybe move spend less money. I got engaged, I decided to uproot and move across the county then moved 3 weeks later. There's a solid 5 years of this shit. Anyways shit was getting a little out of hand.  

In my downs life would suddenly halt and appear to have fallen apart. I get incredibly anxious, I get controlling,  I would sleep a lot. Usually 15+ hours a day for a week or two. This lasted for 5 weeks at one point, but drugs contributed heavily that time. Addiction takes the wheel a lot of time. 

I don't like that guy. I have real things going for me now. I have dope under control and only do it once a month. 

A bunch of great shit has happened to me the last few weeks. I got my license back, got rid of my warrant, my massive fine is payed off with the help of family so I free of that shit. I met a super cool girl that I really like which hasn't happened in a long time. My sex drive has been basically null for the last year, I haven't bothered to get with anyone.

It's just so fucked up it's like I enjoyed these things, I'm pleased life is going good but I feel no different than every other day. 

I'm pretty sure it's the combo of Suboxone and lamictal but if I stop either med the monster takes over and everything I've worked on the last few months will be thrown away and I will probably dig a bigger hole next time. ",1451455494.0

Hey y'all. So here's the deal

I've been recreationally using vicodin since about 10th grade when I was 16 or 17, so I'm quite familiar with it. I never used on consecutive days (until this week, but I'll get back to that later), and I always used sparingly, like months apart each time.....early on my dose would range from 15-20 mg...

I'm a 6'0 240 pound guy...so two weeks ago I got a prescription for 10/325's.hadnt used in about a year and a half..fell into the habit of using again and noticed this time I need more like 25-35 mg...I used last monday -22.5 mg...tuesday i used 25, wednesday used 30..stopped thursday and friday... saturday and sunday i reached my highest of 35 mg...(i have excellent self control, so please no talk about getting addicted)..needless to say 35 mg made me feel very fuzzy and euphoric

today I was playing ball at the local park and one of my friends had some oxy's, i thought what the heck let me try them out....they are 5/325's.he gave me 7 of them..i know oxy's are generally considers 1-1.5 times stronger...so how many would i need to take to equal my 35 mg high from vicodins?? any help is greatly appreciated...

also if you could elaborate a little on the differences in the highs..is it true oxy is a little more speedier? i control myself just fine on hydro infront of company. Will this be harder on oxy? will they be able to tell easier by looking at me that im under the influence?

TL;DR: I am quite familiar with hydrocodone, my doses range from 25-35 mg...it's going to be my first time using oxycodone today..i have seven 5mg pills..how many should i take so i feel similar to what 35 mg of hydro made me feel? i wanna be high but no too wrecked",1451453822.0

The main thing I noticed about Cape Cod is alot of the people in it didn't seem to be on the street. They all had places to live, cars, nice cellphones, and nice clothes.

I really wanna know why that is, why it was a big thing in Bth but now a days you don't really see it as much. Yes, its still out there, but I dont automatically assume HIV when I see drug addict. 

The last thing, I noticed was in BTH it didnt really talk about people overdosing, and thats a main focus in Cape Cod. 

Maybe /u/traceyh415 can give some insight.

I overall like both a lot. Cape Cod gives a modern day life in the addicts. BTH I would say is the beginning of heroin epidemic.

So I've been suffering through a truly shitty day in WD (at work, too) waiting to start taking Suboxone. 

But then.

By the grace of Junkie Jesus, out of the clear blue sky I just scored, and now I feel like doing cartwheels of joy. It's amazing how the WD symptoms seem to begin to disappear before you even have some; just having it in your hands is enough for your body to heave a sigh of sweet relief.

I also noticed I've been a member of this sub (and reddit in general) for a year today, so happy anniversary to me.

Happy new year folks, I hope you end the year with a stroke of good luck, too.",1451425575.0

What that means in the real world is that if you are in WD and you take Ibogaine you won't be in any WD while on Ibogaine.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now onto the facility experience. I was at the facility for 13 days and tripped 9 of those days. I went in with a 2 g IV habit of tar per day and left completely clean. I did not experience any WD at all. They would give you Ibogaine in the am then after you came down you would get low dose morphine that they tapered every day til you don't need it any more. Anyone doing just one dose will experience diminished WD afterwards for about a day.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel amazing and while I have had some mental cravings all physical cravings are gone. Just want to spread the good word.

""Yo. Who the fuck is this?"" Elray had that classic dopeboy swagger. The kind of dude that would roll up to the welfare office in a brand new Bentley with 24s, covered in jewelry and bitches with no shame. Just a bunch of flashy shit I wasted the last two years of my life paying for. The kind of shit that screams ""fucking drug dealer"" ""Yeah, it's Green. I smashed my phone after I saw you getting hit, bro but since I grabbed that bag I knew they didn't have shit on you. I held onto it for you, by the way."" I was hoping with every ounce of faith I had left in my strung out body that he would buy my lies. I needed him to think I'm on his side, he was my only scapegoat. Yet I couldn't help but feel anything but guilt knowing the fate both the Outlaws and Boller had in store for him. ""Shit, why'd you take so long to hit me up if you knew I was straight? You actin' shady, bruh. I don't like this."" Fuck. He's not as stupid as he seems, I guess. But I couldn't give up. ""Bro, what are you talking about? I just couldn't find your number. I had to get it from Brady over on Baker Street but I had to get my own phone first. Haha. Quit being paranoid, you're cool."" I responded, doing everything in my power to keep him calm. ""Yeah maybe you're right, big homie. My bad. Haha. Where you at? I need that shit ASAP. Good lookin' out."" Fuck yeah! I had him. ""Shit, I'm over on the east side. You wanna swing by here or what?"" I figured there couldn't be any harm in him coming to my hotel. ""Regal 8, you know where that's at?"" ""Yeah I'll be there soon. Keep a look out, I'll ring you when I get there."" Awesome, everything was going smooth and according to plan. I decided to do a shot to calm my nerves while I waited. I had a bit left over from what that cop threw at me and still enough to pay back Elray. I started the process eagerly, full of excitement. Emotions that quickly evaporated as I realized I wasn't even getting high anymore. Just getting well. It was good enough for now. I laid back staring at my phone blankly. Emily's number on the screen while my thumb floated over the little green circle. I thought back to nights when I laid in bed and held her until the sun rose and our alarms went off. I'd wake up and she'd have lines ready for us on a mirror glass surface and a cup of joe to wash it down. It really helped with the taste, mostly. Just being honest. The phone hit my face and I was pulled back into reality. I guess I'm higher than I thought. I sat up, lighting a cigarette as the ring tone went off. ""What's up?"" I answered, knowing good and well exactly what it was that is ""up."" ""Recognize, fool"" Eleray responded. Even he knew I knew, I guess."" ""Ha. Yeah, room 118."" I said with a chuckle. ""Fuck that. You know what my car look like."" Was his rebuttal. I could respect his suspicions. ""Word."" Click. I grab the bag and tuck it in my waste line. Hitting the cigarette and begging it to calm my nerves. I ashed it and walked out the door. Of course the fucker parked on the other side of the lot. Of course he fucking did. I walked across the lot, trying my best to look inconspicuous. Not an easy task in an area such as this. I hopped in his truck and he immediately pulled away. ""Woah, what's up man?"" I protested. He reached out his hand, wanting what was his and I handed it to him. He looked at it for a few seconds, examining it, and stopped abruptly. Fuck. He smiled and glanced at me. He was tall and thin but not lanky. His gold tooth shined off the streetlights of this mangey old motel as he took off his hat and looked me in the eye. I had no idea how to feel, let alone how to react. ""Haha."" I managed, nervously . ""So, wh-"" ""I'ma give you one chance."" He interrupted. ""Yeah?"" I replied. His smile faded as his hand lay on his waistband. The imprint of a pistol outlined his black t-shirt. I could feel my heartbeat in my god damn throat. ""What you tell that fucking pig when he stopped you at the Marathon?"" HOW THE FUCK. I snapped like a fucking twig. A spineless twig. ""Listen. Wait."" I started, stuttering. ""He wants me to set you up. He gave me money, and a phone and said he'd call me when he's ready but it's cool. I've got it under control. I'm handling it."" I quickly released. ""Yeah?! Under control?! Handling it?!"" He was outraged. Justifiably. ""What the fuck is your master fucking plan, genius?!"" He continued. ""Let me enlighten you, bitch. I've got connections and they're going to handle it."" I was bluffing so hard, putting all of my chips in Tyler's hands, really. I had no idea what his plan was if he even had one. It was probably my worst gamble. ""Nah, fuck that. We gonna handle it like men. Right fuckin' now."" He says, grinning from ear to fucking ear as if he just had a psychotic break. ""Wait, what do you mean?"" I was terrified. He looked up, facing the mirror to fix himself up. ""Let me tell you a story."" He said as he pulled a cigarette from behind his ear and wiped fuzz out of his dreads. ""You see.."" He started, lighting the cigarette while looking at me through the mirror. ""This shit goes deep... real deep"" He went on to tell me all about him and the officer's past. I guess this Boller's been chasing him for a few years now, going as far as taking members of his family into the station for petty crimes they didn't commit just to try and get them to talk. Shoplifting, disorderly conduct, paraphernalia charges, all small shit until one night I guess he went to far... Roughed his brother up and left him in a parking lot, thinking nothing of it I guess. But he bled out and died that same night. Officer Boller made sure he was first on scene to make sure the investigation went his way. ""Not shit for evidence, the case went cold within a fucking week."" He finished up. I wasn't sure how he knew it was the cop, but I wasn't questioning something like that. ""Shit, bro. I had no idea."" I started. ""Yeah, you didn't."" He cut me off. ""But it's aight, this shit ends tonight. Now pack up, you ain't gonna wanna be around after tonight."" He finished as he pulled off.
Anxiously awaiting our arrival I chain smoked at least four cigarettes, shaking with fear my lack of composure was obvious. We pull up across the street with the lights dimmed. Incognito. ""Here. Strap up, Lil Homie it's time to prove yoself."" Elray stated with the same sick sadistic smile. His wonderful care package included leather gloves, a ski mask, a pistol, and a black out bag I'm assuming used to cover Boller's face. ""Alright, I got it."" I was ready to get this over with. Who would have known all those years ago, the days when I was stealing pills from my grandmas medicine cabinet that it would lead up to this. This moment all caused by the ripple effect that is addiction. Fuck. ""Let's roll."" And we did. We snuck around the single story in the heart of suburbia , passing between the house and the garage to make it to the back. Checking every window to look for signs of life. Nothing. It was quiet. Eerily quiet. We bust the back door window and open the back door, being as quiet as possible we creep into the kitchen but still we find the place way too quiet. We sneak through the living room and into the hall. ""Check the bathroom."" Elray commands. I open the bathroom door and check for signs of life. Nothing. Of course my first instinct was to check the medicine cabinet but I resist the urge, for once. ""All clear, E. Where you at?"" I ask with no answer. ""E?"" The silence is broken with the crash of breaking glass. I rush to the bedroom to find Elray in a chokehold with a gun to his head. ""The fuck?!"" I scream with no time to act before I'm thrown to the ground and kicked in the head. I look up to see Boller tied up on the bed next to his wife. Both taken out, execution style. Cold. Before I know it there's a boot to my head and its lights out. ""Wakey achey, sleepy head."" I wake up in the back of what I'm assuming is a van to the sound of a familiar voice. My head pounding far too much to recognize. I open my swollen eye to see none other than Tyler. ""What's up big homie?! Sorry about the curb stomp. Hahaha. We didn't know who the fuck you were! And how'd you even know we were coming tonight? Either way perfect timing, my dude! The Outlaws took care of your piggy problems and you gave them Ol' Elray. Perfect fuckin' transaction!"" He was obviously excited everything worked out according to plan. A plan I was unaware of. ""Yeah, where the fuck are we? And where's my stuff?"" I was confused. The van was moving. ""Shit, the boys got us taken care of! They busted your phone, got rid of your shit and took care of your truck, too. No one will ever know we were even in town tonight. We're solid!"" He responded. ""Hey you ever been to New York? Fucking beautiful this time of year. Bet."" ""New York?! What the fuck are you talking about?!"" ""The Big Apple! You know! Haha. We gotta bust bro! No chance the 5-0 will even find you out there mother fucker. You left yesterday morning anyway, remember?"" He finished with a wink. We stopped at an old truck stop at the edge of town and transferred vehicles. ""Yo put this on, you need to clean up."" Tyler said as he threw me a shirt. I put it on and got in the car. Setting the seat back to find some comfort. Lighting a cigarette and cracking the window as Tyler starts the car. We pull on the highway and I look back thinking of all I'm leaving behind. My family, my mom, and most importantly, my dear Emily. How would I explain any of this to her? To anybody? What's going to happen to my life? I have so many questions, but for now the one thing I want more than anything is sleep. Peaceful, quiet, sleep.

My usual dose hasn't been helping as well as it usually does. This weather has me all messed up which I feel is contributing to my pain levels being so out of control lately. Anyway, I've been taking pretty much double my usual dose most days.

My question is has anyone had problems with their eyes becoming really puffy and swollen while taking larger doses of oxycodone? On top of the swollen/puffy eyes I've noticed my face has become extra ""oily"" in the morning and even around my eyes. This isn't typical for me and it's actually kinda gross. 

So has anyone noticed this as well or know what it could be from? Another thing is I of course tend to smoke more cigarettes, so I'm wondering if that contributes to the swollen eyes.

I get home, and decide to smoke it out of my bowl I use for weed. Need a screen, so I put in a few pieces of aluminum foil. Now, I've done this before, but what happened next has never happened before. While smoking, the aluminum foil caught on fire. I stopped immediately. I got a new piece of foil from the same exact roll, held my lighter to it for like 30 seconds straight, and no ignition at any point. So I figured it was the hard catching fire, and kept going.

But it kept happening. And the last hit I took was harsh AS FUCK. It made me cough. Like in the middle of inhaling I just started coughing from it. Couldn't really tell what was going on by taste, crack to me has always tasted like I was smoking pieces of PCP or just anything plastic. So wtf? The aluminum couldn't have been catching on fire right? If it was, how come I couldn't make it happen again when I tried, with the flame held even longer! If it was just the crack burning, why did I have a coughing fit which has never happened even with my biggest hits.

I'm just scared as hell. I know this is an opiates forum, but my main account is a regular poster here, I'm just too embarrassed about this. If it makes anyone, especially the mods, feel better; I did a bag of this ECP as soon as I got inside to calm my nerves. So yea, should I worry about my health?

2. Is this safe?

3. I normally take 25-35 mg of hydrocodone at once, will 20 MG of hydrocodone and 10 MG of oxycodone get me as high? Last night I took 25 mg oxy, didnt really enjoy it or feel it as much as just the hydro by itself. So I'm guessing mixing it will provide for a more unique and stronger high...

4. How should I take them so they hit both at the same time? Oxy first and then hydro? or other way around? how many minutes between each one?",1451535306.0

Obviously there’s so many more stories than that, and so much more detail, especially once I get down into the 4 years ago when heroin started for myself, but I’m just starting with the really really big memories and working my way through and only spending a little bit of time on it for now.

12 years ago;

Car accident… I remember being trapped inside the cab of my brand new Chevy Colorado, the engine was bear hugging the tree in front of me. My senses still disorientated, but I remember just smelling the blood. Before the tree I had splashed through a ditch and then a horse fence, my window had been down and there it was a piece of fucking white plastic fence sticking out of my forearm. However enough about the accident...

The reward for my incredibly over exaggerated injuries. (I looked beat up, but if I had to be honest I was pretty much ok.) Was bottles of 10mg/325mg hydro/apap, 10mg flexiril, and .5mg xanax. (No fucking idea why I got the xanax.) Anyway, I’ve always been the sharing type with my drugs, so me and a few friends quickly educated ourselves on exactly what everything did… I never took anything without looking it up extensively beforehand, not that we added any idea of safety when we proceeded to take said substances. Granted we already knew what norcos and xanax were, but flexiril was a new one, and we also decided to bring in a bottle of captain morgan on this adventure as well.

Not entirely sure what happened that entire night, but I do remember some rather intense tunnel vision. I woke up feeling like death… And then I took the norcos by themselves that morning, and realized that was all I ever needed, ever again. 3 days later I actually called the doctor and said I lost my prescription of norcos, they actually gave me another bottle! The nurse I talked to totally knew I was full of shit, but this is before people cared about prescription opioids. I fell in love with opiates, and though I only had that script for a month, it had left it’s mark.

10 years ago;

One of those holidays that family gets together at my grandma’s house, can’t quite remember which one it was. I had a killer headache, and already I’m somewhat introverted and completely exhausted by questions from family on how exactly college is going, or “What exactly are you going to do with a degree in philosophy?”. So I ask my grandma if I can lay down somewhere. I go to the bedroom, lay down, and fall asleep.

When I wake up, I drift over to the bathroom. The bottom cabinet is open, and I see what looks like hundreds of pill bottles. Curiosity got the best of me, and to my amazement there was a mountain of hydro/apap. Well I took a bottle and stuffed it in my pocket, then reached it back out of my pocket, then put it back in my pocket… I decided might as well grab some from another one of the bottles for eating right now and keep the WHOLE bottle I was stealing for later. I crack the ones I take from another bottle each in half, cup some water from the faucet with my hand to help 5 of those big yellow pills go down, and proceed to walk back to the family party. Half way back through the room, I turn back around, I’m fucking jingling with these pills making a scene in my pocket. I go back to the bathroom and stuff toilet paper in the pill bottle until I can barely get the lid back on, shake it around a bit to make sure no audible noise is heard. Success! ‘I’m a fucking ninja’. I turn back around and head to the family, by this time the initial waves of pure warmth are developing through my whole body and mind. Ask away those questions you family members I see maybe once a year! I know you don’t really give a fuck about what you're asking, but it’s all gooood.

By now I had been getting roxies between me and some friends pretty regularly. It still seemed innocent enough, I mean we never developed a physical dependency or anything, just something we did on weekends a couple times a month. Doop days we called them, so that around our more judging friends we could just say D-days.

One d-day mission had us driving halfway to Vegas, ended up in Barstow to pick up 200 30mg oxycodones. We were going to continue to vegas, but then we got high and just drove back completely content to fuck the rest of the weekend off. Some glass night table top being passed around the SUV to snort line, after line, after line, of that blue powder up our noses. Listening to ok computer all the way back home.

6 years ago;

The night before my best friends birthday… We were hanging out and an old friend came by that we were giving a second chance, he had gone the way of heroin a long time before… but he really turned out to be a scumbag as a junkie, like really truly… (I guess you could make the argument that I did eventually as well, but fuck off, I wasn’t there yet.) Anyway, he says he's clean, looks cleanish, okay have some drinks with us. At some point he gave us some xanax, now I’ve had experience with xanax so I knew what to expect. I had been drinking so I took like 1mg. I was being kind of a buzzkill about it and only allowed my buddy to get 1mg as well, he was even drunker than me at the time, and never had taken xanax before. Anyway at some point they had a conversation, and decided they needed to go pick up more alcohol. They didn't want me to come, and two fucking hours later they get back with no extra alcohol. Not that I cared, I was already done drinking, but seriously wtf. Then they want to leave and go back to this dudes apartment.

I begrudgingly go with them with a bad feeling, next thing I know we are in this dudes room and they are totally prepping shots. Fuuuck, I mean my best buddy was out of it, I was pretty sure he was fed more xanax than I had originally allowed… I throw a fit, they assure me it’ll be fine… By then I’m pissed, was left in the dark. I know the junkie buddy had used my best buddy’s extra birthday money that was for tomorrow to get the heroin anyway, so really it’s just about getting himself some… Fuck, fuck, fuck, this situation. “I want one.” I finally decide.

The mother fucker says “No.” ! Fuck I have money, take my fucking money for it, give me a fucking shot. Lets fucking bang this shit, what the fuck ever. “I didn’t get enough.” I still am calling bullshit to this day on that one. Anyway I’m pissed, I leave the fucking room and go to sleep on the couch in the living room.

Next thing I know I’m being shaken awake by fucktard… “He isn’t waking up! He isn’t waking up”. I’m a little out of it, but I hear about wanting to drag him out into the living room. I just tell him fuck that and I start dialing 911 right away. I finally get around to helping him drag my best friend into the living room, lips fucking blue, I was in a silent panic. What the fuck, I immediately started thinking about how angry I was at this fucker, how angry I was at myself, because I knew this was a bad idea and should have never let this happen. A billion fucks being yelled in my head from every which way possible. Then denial after the ambulance got there, ‘He’ll be fine’. Once we get to the hospital, everything will turn out fine.

Well it wasn’t.",1451534181.0

I took a hair dryer, and held it to the opening of the envelope to heat up the glue on all 6 envelopes, holding them closed with my fingers until it somewhat held. I stacked all 6 so that the openings that I heated and closed were all on one side, and then put that side under the edge of my Xbox. I left it there for around 6 hours.

First off, I'm not a stranger to addiction because I have/had a habit myself (but not with opiates) so I know certain things, habits, and how to deal with an addict. I just know very little about opiate addictions. 

My grandfather is 84 years old and a retired fire fighter (he actually still works at the fire house. It's his only joy in life). He also drives a cab part time. He's a real character. He's from New York City and has that whole ""old school gangster"" attitude (and was involved with some shady shit for a while).  His whole life he has had a gambling addiction. He is aware that this is a problem for him (but he just recently acknowledge this). The past 8 months it has gotten very bad. He has taken many loans out on credit cards and his house that he can not pay. Also, he has loan sharks to deal with. Over the years he has cut off all his family members except me. I'm not sure why, but he likes me a lot. So when my family found out he is in big trouble, they elected me to go visit him at his home to see what I/we could do. I had never visited him in new york, he had only visited me in my state. So a few weeks ago, I fly in to visit him. We ate diner and everything was good, catching up. He told me how he now knows that his gambling is out of hand and that he wants help. I was so relieved that he was asking for help and told him that I was here for him, etc. When it was time to go to bed, I said I couldn't sleep so I was going to take a a Benydrl. He immediately offered me some Valium which I refused. I asked why he had so much Valium (he had a lot) and he told me his doctor prescribed it for him for anxiety (which is true, my grandfather is an anxious fuck). He went to bed and I still couldn't sleep so I decided to go to his medicine cabinet for the valium. When I opened it up, I was met with a whole pharmacy. Valium, hydrocodone, Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycodone were all in there. Some bottles had a good amount of pills, some had little amount. I was trying to think of reasons he needed these. I know he was old, but he didn't seem to be in pain. He's a very active man, he even goes for a jog sometimes. In the morning I asked, ""Papa, why do you have so many of these pills? Do you need all these?"" and he answered, ""Yeah, I need them. I take them almost every day. If I don't I start to feel sick. I don't feel right"". I told him that really wasn't very good and he could be addicted to them. He got really upset saying he wasn't addicted to them and that his doctor gave them to him. I tried to explain to him that even though the doctor gave them to him, he could have a habit. He wouldn't listen to me and just ignored me.

I wen't about my visit, helping him with things, talking with the bank (I'm only 18 years old. This is the most grown up thing I've had to do in my life). We were out to dinner one night and he said he felt sick. He pulled out two empty bottles from his pocket and started to freak out. It seemed that he was having a panic attack so we left. He was having a melt down in the car and I told him that it was going to be okay, I would call a friend of mine (my one and only friend in new york) to see if she could help us out. He got more calm and we drove to her house. On arrival, my friend asked how many I would like (she had Oxycotin and I forgot the dosage) and I said 4. When I got out to the car and gave them to him, he started to freak out and say this wasn't enough. This made me very alarmed because that meant his tolerance must be pretty high (right?). He then opened up to me and told me he had a slight ""mix up"" (in his words this means overdose) at his bosses house but was okay. He acted very normal about it. So here is my questions: 

It seems he has a high tolerance to some kind of pill but I'm not sure what. Can you guys tell me a little about tolerance and how to control it?

He is taking all these pills orally but I noticed that he was also snorting a few. Is one method more dangerous than the other? He does have a bad heart (not sure if this information helps).


If there is one thing I know, the only way to get a person to stop is if they want to. The thing with my grandpa is he LITERALLY dosent understand that this is an addiction (he's not a super smart person. He dropped out of school in the 4th grade and has literally no idea about drugs). Since for his age, should I put him in rehab? 


What is going to happen when he runs out? (I'm not going to take them away from him but his supply of money is literally zero now. There is no way he can pay for it. He has lost his job at the fire house recently). When a person his age gets sick, it's BAD. Is opiate sickness (which I heard is like the flu) actually kill you? When he gets the flu, he almost has to be hospitalized (due to a weak immune system). 

Thank you for in advance for answering the questions. I'm sorry for the long post and for my naivety. All advice is appreciated. Also, if this post dosent belong here, let me know. I just had no idea where to put it.

Any reply appreciated. 

Stay safe

Edit:  I meant k8 like the 8mg hydromorphone pill, not the little green bastards. 

Edit2:  the reason I'm asking is because the calculators online only account for non-iv'ing oxycodone and I iv it. So if I'm iv'ing 160mg of oxycodone, how much could I iv hydromorphone?",1451502542.0
