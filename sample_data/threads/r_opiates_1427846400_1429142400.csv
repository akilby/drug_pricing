If there's enough interest I'd go about making one.

The major impracticalities with wheel filters is that they are generally best suited to preparing more than one shot a time. they are also not cheap ($1-$2 each) but can be reused a few times as long as proper precautions are taken to maintain the sterility of one side of the filter. Because they are membrane filters, they also require saturation on both sides and any air bubbles will slow or stop filtration... all things that are much easier to demonstrate than describe.

The benefits are being able to cold sterilize any solution (even puddle water) and remove all binders from pills being used to prep for IV. Because your solutions will be analytically sterile, they can be kept in a fridge for a period of time without any danger, and also eliminate the risk of tissue infection as long as proper IV technique is followed.

312eux,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/312eux/methadone_maintenance_questions/,5,https://redd.it/312eux,throwawaydrugtest95,Methadone maintenance questions,"So, with a heavy heart i started methadone maintenance today.  I'm giving up my sub doctor for a few reasons. The bupe just wasn't working for me any more and I couldn't stop myself from selling the subs and buying dope.  So,  despite being cheaper and less time consuming,  going to the sub doctor was not improving my quality of life at all. In fact,  when I was in the clinic before(on bupe though),  I was stable, not relapsing, paid my bills,  and had more money. It makes me sad to give up, to concede defeat yet again,  but I'm hoping I can turn things around and at least live a little better life. 

This is my first real go at methadone maintenance,  so I have some questions: 

1. How long did it take you to settle in and feel ok for an entire day(coming off a 10 bag per day average)?  

2. Has anyone here successfully switched from 'done to subs,  and if so, how challenging was it? 

3. Does it benefi you at all to keep the dose as low as possible,  or is it just as painful to taper off 40mgs as it is 100 mgs? 

If anyone bothered to read this, and answer, thank you! I know some of these are impossible to really answer as a lot of it is subjective. I'm just having a tough time dealing with this decision and wanted to hear from people.

Or at least he thought that's where he was. His mind drifted once more to contemplating just how he got himself to this point. Strung out, broke, homeless and sick; but nevertheless a normal fixture in the syringe and feces laden jungle that is San Francisco's Tenderloin District. Average men and women passing through, going about their work day, would have no need to look twice.

But the fact that this was somewhat of an ordinary scene in this part of town didn't do much to diminish the pain and agony of his tortured soul. In fact, Seth was preparing to die.

Clutched in his hand was a dose 4 times the usual.

Normally, after scoring his afternoon fix, Seth would waste no time. Straight to business it was. But this was different. Seth paused; he noticed this pungent smell of his urine soaked pants and the sweat on his palms that glistened the sunlight. Time seemed slower, thicker.

A business woman with shiny high heels and a nice gold watch walked by. ""Gross,"" she said... or gave a look to say. Or, Seth thought. He didn't know. By this point in his life he was on the edge of constant delusion. But even if she didn't say it aloud, it made no matter. Seth knew all too well what he had become. And assuredly the demeaning glances still hurt, even after all that had happened.

And with that Seth was ready.

The ritual was sacred. Seth broke up the heroin, piece by piece. Tiny brown flakes sticking to his fingers, but most found their way to the spoon. He added the water that he found in a discarded plastic bottle. His lighter was out, so he just had to stir it until it all dissolved properly. A cold cook it is called. This would normally annoy Seth, because it takes longer, but not this time. He savored the extra minutes like a fine wine, although he wasn't quite sure why.

Next he grabbed for a spent cotton in his pocket and tossed it in the mix. With the dull syringe he drew up the amber-brown liquid. It was very thick due to the amount and traveled slowly through the cylinder. Again, Seth was abnormally patient.

He nearly began to reconsider, but, alas, the shot was already loaded. No sense in wasting it now.

It usually took Seth hours to find a proper vein, but as fate would have it, he hit red on the very first try. The beautiful plume rocketed though the mixture. He slammed the plunger quickly.

As Seth felt the overwhelming sensation begin to crawl up his backside and behind his throat he had no choice but to let gravity take him. He laid there on the concrete with the syringe still hanging, bouncing, in his abscessed forearm.

Seth's face was now planted on the rough sidewalk. Strangely enough, despite the tidal wave of euphoria, Seth noticed that the abrasive sidewalk was painful to his face. This was the last thought Seth had before he lost consciousness.",1427900330.0

Sometimes the mail arrives in 2 days however.

So i head to work, and i forget to bring my sub which i was going to take to get me through the day if the package wasnt there (mail arrives before i start my shift). So on the way im freaking out hoping that its waiting for me.

I get to work (late) and thus was unable to grab fits on the way.

I walk into the mailroom, i ask, and theres my mail!! YAY!!! i am elated. It feels like all my WD symptoms dissapear instantly.

I then proceed to run the 5 minutes to the closet chemist for a pack of IV gear (HR purposes in my country) for $10. I put my baggie in the bag this came in + some other stuff as i leave the chemist.

On the way back to work i take the stuff back out and hide it on me including the IV pack so if i get caught it doenst look like i went shopping. I throw out the bag in a public bin (in the middle of the city).

When i get back to work i straight away go to my desk, sit down, fiddle around(so it doesnt appear im gone for too long) then run off to the disabled toilets to do the deed.

After i unpack everything, i look for the gear. SHIT. its. DEFINITELY. not in my pockets.

I think, FUCK. i left it in the bag which is in the bin 9 floors down and 3 minute run away. This bin was almost overflowing.

I pack up my shit and SPRINT to the bin as fast as i can. I get there, and i see the bag in the bin. Joy.

I get to the bin and open the bag looking for the h. nothing.. FUCK

So i run back to work, to my desk, freaking out thinking its fallen out somewhere near my desk and im fired....

I get in, and everyones chilled (and i think i avoided anyone seeing me pant like a motherfucker). I search my desk and i find it in my hoodie pocket........  I don't recall putting it there still.

I then proceed to the relocate back to the bathroom and the rest of the day is a is a happier and slightly more relaxed but boring story :)

It would be perfect if we could get 2 more teams for our #opiates Fantasy Baseball League...  We have 8 teams now which is enough to have a pretty good league but I always find 10 teams to be ideal.  The draft is tomorrow night at 9:30pm EST.  Honestly it's not a big deal if you aren't around for the draft.  Autopick teams tend to usually end up pretty decent and balanced.

Also I find that the true winners in Fantasy sports tend to be the people who pay attention and make moves during the season... so your starting team while important is not necessarily going to make or break your season.

I had 6 months clean time after a 6yr hydro/oxycodone addiction and recently started back up for 3 months. I kicked again, and I am currently on day 6 of withdrawal. Ready to end the love affair yet again. God I hate withdrawing. 

During my sober period I was prescribed ambien for the horrid insomnia we all seem tk get when we become sober.. Didnt like it for awhile, but now I have developed an affinity for it. Go figure lol. Ambien completely kills my anxiety, and then puts my ass right to sleep.

So, I now have another drug that I have to worry about interactions from with other meds. I really don't take anything, regularly, that would ever interact with this medication so i never worry about it.

For this kick I used gabapentin, xanax, and lope for the first 6 days pretty comfortably. Today I woke up with no gabapentin or lope. I can definitely say I wasn't as comfortable. I have some minor aches, and the dreaded rls.

Today I had (4) 0.25mgs xanax left in my arsenal. I took .5mg at 2pm and another .5 at 4:30 to try to sleep after class. Apparently I have developed a little tolerance because 1mg didn't knock me out. I am aware xanax has a long half-life, but I want to take ambien tonight and not be scared about if i will wake up. I wish I could use more xanax, but i don't have it and don't want to get addicted to that either. I wont be taking the ambien for at least another 4 hrs, which will be 8hs or more after my last .5mg dose of xanax. Do you have any experience or believe this to be reasonably safe?

Hell yeah I wanted that number.  This was how I met Benny.  I was warned he could be a bit...overbearing.  But at 19 you tend to just go for shit.  So I called.

Benny pulled up in an Acura Integra all shiny and red.  He got out, grabbed my hand and then hugged me which I found offsetting but I went with it.

""So you're Clark's friend eh?  He told me about you"", said Benny lighting up a smoke and seemingly unconcerned he was double parked in front of the university.  

""Yup.""

""You're from San Francisco?  They got good shit out there or what?""

""Yeah.""

""You know any fags?""

""What?""

""You know queers and shit.  I heard San Francisco's full of fags.""

I smiled.  This was the third person I've met out here who asked me if I knew any homosexuals because I was from San Francisco.  

""Sure.""

""Alright San Fran, lets hit the road.  Clark said you wanted some stamps...Hey you're a big dude.  How tall are you?""

""Like 6'2 maybe.""

""Tell you what, ride with me, I'll show you the city, buy you lunch and toss in a couple freebies.  What do you say?""

I should have said, ""I have class!"" or ""No thanks!"", but I got in.

We drove almost 30 minutes through various neighborhoods.  New York was kinda dingy and grim looking.  Lots of old buildings decaying with new ones sprouting right next to them.  There did not seem to be much thought in planning and new construction blotted out the sky.  We pulled up to a small park.  A well dressed guy in a business suit approached the car.

""Alright man, don't speak to this prick.  Just stare at him ok?""

""What?  Why?""

""Just do it, it'll be funny.""

So I stared.  The guy came up to the car and looked inside at Benny.  

""Hi Benny, sorry to make you come out here...""

""You got it?"", asked Benny.    

""No not quite yet...Oh is this your friend?  Hi!  My name is Don!  Don Jenkins!"", said the man thrusting his hand at me.  

As instructed I just stared at him

""Ok..."", said Don, ""Look guys...""

""Coming back tomorrow Don"", said Benny, ""Don't make us get out of the fucking car ok?""

""Yeah.  Uh sure no problem..."", said Don as we sped off.

""Hah!  You see that prick?!  Told you!"", laughed Benny.

Next Benny handed me a crumpled McDonald's bag.  

""There's nothing in it.  Just put your hand in it and keep it on your lap"", winked Benny as he drove up to a group of college aged kids in front of a coffee shop.  A guy with a ponytail jogged over to the car.

""Heeey Benny!"", the guy said.

""You got it?"", asked Benny looking very angry.

""Well..."", said the guy.

Benny looked at me and then at the bag.  The guy looked at the bag and his eyes got huge.

""Yeah man, let me go get it!"", said the guy backing off.  He handed me a roll of cash which Benny took.

""Thanks!"", and we drove off.

Now I was getting worried.  This was kind of fun but getting more sketchy.  Benny didn't seem too worried about anything.  He smoked weed in front of cops, parked anywhere and screamed obscenities to people he knew on the street.  Some in greeting and some as threats.

""Alright bag trick again.  But with cash..."", said Benny counting bills into the bag, ""This looks professional.  Just hand it to him when I say so.""

""Uhm...""

""Don't worry man, we're almost done.  You'll like this one.""

The biggest white guy I have ever seen stood outside the car.  He had Slavic features and spoke heavily accented Russian English which Benny seemed to understand.  He passed a garbage bag into the car.  Benny opened it and I could see 2 handguns.  Dear God...I thought.  Benny nodded at me.

""Pay the man.""

Meekly I handed over the bag and the man accepted it without counting and walked casually away into a laundromat.

I did get my lunch but could barely eat.  In fact I had the shits from sleep deprivation, dope sickness and heart pumping primal fear.  In the dorms I did some bumps and felt better.  But hell, I never ever used that number again.

I've known my SO longer than I haven't; we've been friends for over a decade and in love for about the same amount. After years of bad timing, we're finally together. I know all of his dirt and he knows mine. He moved across the country to be with me and I helped him kick (this was kick number 5, I think) and it was agonizing. He was clean two months and got a job...I wasn't even worried anymore.

Just recently, I found out he's copped a few times after he was acting super sketch. Dude can hide his stash and his rig, but the one thing he can't hide from me after a thousand years of friendship is when he is high. I know his eyes and moods too well.

He's used on and off for 10 years and I was under the impression that when we finally got together he'd be able to stop. I feel kind of stupid that I thought I was the exception to the rule. I want to laugh, party, have fun, and indulge in light drug use myself. I want to be with this guy forever. I want to travel. I want to do a lot of things in life with this person, but they can't include a junk habit. I want him to live long and be well and have a sex drive again. I'd like the brain damage to stop. Notice all of the ""I's""? I realize that I'm being selfish, but I feel like I've waited a lifetime to be with him and we haven't come this far for me to lose to H. The lying, sneaking around, and sketchiness are almost worse than the drug use. Almost.

I love this person more than anything. Do we have a chance? Is there anything I can do to curb or stop his cravings? Any advice you redditors can offer?

Side note: opiates are the shit. I love to chew up some pills and get faded every now and then. No judgement. I just can't have it be a regular part of life.

[Edit: I'm not looking to give an ultimatum here, I'm a fighter and want to be with him. I'm realizing now he'll probably never quit for good, but I don't want him to cop a habit again.]

[Edit 2: Since copping a few times he's only snorted it and says he doesn't want to shoot ever again. Is that progress? It seemed like it.]",1427822384.0

So I just have a question about suboxone. It's something I am very naive about and I'm just curious.

Anyway, a little back story. I have a relative that had a very bad drug habit. He did pretty much anything he could get his hands on but his favorite was of course heroin. He has supposedly been clean for 15 or more years with a slip up here and there.

Now he will buy suboxone pills off the streets and take them when he is starting to get cravings again. 

Is that how this works? Will it prevent him from getting too much of an urge to use? Is he possibly getting a similar high off suboxone? Or does it not even work that way? 

Sorry to sound dumb I just really know nothing about this and I was just curious.

I work in a studio. The people that have been in lately are fronted by a guy who'd been publicly associated with dope in the past and, over the course of session, was leaving mounting evidence of using  in the bathroom. I noticed one thing immediately: I swept the floor and found just the very top of a glassine bag behind the toilet. Thing was, it was my first day working there and I didn't know how often (or how thoroughly) the bathroom was swept. I filed that away as maybe only a coincidence.

But over the next couple weeks, I started finding those little rubber bands literally *everywhere* – in the live room, in the control room – especially in the bathroom.

I also noticed that the toilet tank cover kept getting these weird brown stains on it too; like I'd clean the bathroom, go hang out for a while, come back, and it'd be stained again. I (pretty quickly) assumed it was blood.

Now here's my first, minorly stupid thing: I don't know why – I guess because it never seemed full enough – but I didn't empty the garbage in the bathroom for this entire session. So I went to throw away some paper towel I was using to wipe the mirror down and something caught my eye – a baggie. I took the top of the can  off and saw a fucking MOUNTAIN of empty and torn up baggies, blood-soaked paper towels, cottons, and at least one needle (didn't look *that* closely through the trash once I saw that... luckily it was capped).

Now I'm not sure if he'd been disposing of this stuff gradually or if he just dumped it all one day. 

Well, I'd been hanging out with these guys for a couple weeks at that point, all joking around and having a good time; and this dude and I seemed to show signs that we could probably hang out and get high sometime; and I got it in my head that I'd try to secretly ask him if he wanted to get high sometime. I thought up this ridiculous plan to hand him an 8mg suboxone and my business card (to avoid the awkwardness of exchanging numbers) and just say 'hit me up if you wanna get high sometime.' 

So I taped the sub to my business card and both decided it was a dumb idea and never really had the chance with the two of us alone.... But, somewhere between the studio and my apartment, I LOST it. 

**Repeat:** I lost a sub (of which I have an ever-dwindling supply of [no more health insurance]) with my fucking name, phone number, and email address literally TAPED to the back of it.

Also, I'm only *kind of* ashamed to admit that I grabbed a handful of this guy's empties to scrape. He clearly only dumped them out into his rig and didn't bother to even get all of it out of the corners. I got a fat line out of it.",1427980510.0

However, I ended  up taking a year long break after realizing I was doing OC a bit too often. After enough time passed, I decided to do opiates on an occasional basis again.

While I still experience the same great highs while dosing on OC as I did in the past, hydrocodone seems significantly weaker than I remember.

&nbsp;

-------
&nbsp;
**My Girl**
&nbsp;

I remember the first time I saw her tie off. I watched her eyes roll into the back of her head and a smile slowly creep across her innocent face. It was the first time I had fallen in love with someone. She was more beautiful to me in that moment than ever before. And I grew envious of the feeling she was so selfishly sheltering me from. But it made me want it even more. I had to have what she loved most. I had to know. 

&nbsp;

And so I did.

&nbsp;

It was the second time I had fallen in love. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

-------

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Tara was my vision of perfection. Gorgeously flawed. Imperfection that you could admire. She made me work for her company. I loved the challenge. Right when I thought I had her all to myself, she'd quickly slip away. 

&nbsp;

And then one day she latched on to me. Like a broken child with nowhere else to go. But I would love her, I would be her rock, if she wanted. And that night when she showed up at my apartment she carried only a small backpack- that of which carried a change of clothes and a small envelope filled with a beautiful brown powder. Brown like her eyes. Those eyes. 

&nbsp;

""I want to forget,"" she whispered, staring at the floor. 

&nbsp;

I took her face in my hands and looked at her closely. ""It's okay,"" I said.

&nbsp;

And soon she was wrapped in a warmth of euphoria, and I was nearby, studying the look on her face. I didn't understand, in that moment, why I couldn't be enough. Why couldn't I be the source of her happiness? 

&nbsp;

But as I said, I soon realized there was no greater happiness than heroin. Heroin. It used to seem so taboo. 

&nbsp;

And soon all I need are my two girls. 

&nbsp;

The loves of my life. 

&nbsp;

My happiness. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

-------

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


How did we get here? I can remember my first time. But what about after that? The chase is a blur. The pain was one that I caused myself. I didn't start out running from anything. I was just enjoying the high. And now? The things I've done. For my girls. The pain is there now.

&nbsp;

The nights without her are the worst. Tara can't stand the sight of me. ""Why do we have to go without?"" She'd yell. It was my fault our bodies were aching and the cold sweats had started in. ""Fix this!"" 

&nbsp;

And because I would do anything for her, I would always find a way to get our fix. Whatever it took. It often meant selling my body. Treading about the creepy corners of the streets. Dreading the men that would cling to me like Tara used to. Most of them just wanted to go down on me. They'd follow me into a bathroom stall. I'd watch them fall to their knees and instantly reach for my belt. Every part of me wanted to run away. Find another way. But I never did. Instead I would just think of my girls. Think of my girls.  

&nbsp;

I'd come back to find Tara lying on the floor, knees pulled in close to her chest. A broken child again. She'd look up at me, hopeful for a score. I'd give her a smile back and soon she was in my arms again. 

&nbsp;

""I love you, forever,"" she'd tell me. 

&nbsp;

""Me too, always.""

&nbsp;

Of course her love was a synthetic one. A feeling she could only know when she shot up. But it was all I ever wanted from her. So things continued this way for awhile.

&nbsp;

One morning I opened my eyes to find her deep in thought. I didn't want to ask what she was thinking because I was scared of her answer. She noticed me staring.

&nbsp;

""I want to stop. This life. It's not one that can last.""

&nbsp;

""I know,"" I said. And so she would watch as I tied off, but it wasn't enough for her to only watch. She had to have what we loved most. And things were okay again. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


-------

&nbsp;
&nbsp;


But I knew where Tara was coming from, about the life we were living. It couldn't last. The highs and the lows were nauseating. All of the things I had to do. And for what? A love that is brief and neverlasting. And so I got ready for the last shot. 

&nbsp;

Tara struggled to find a vein, but once she was ready I filled the syringe and slowly slipped it under her skin.

&nbsp;

""That's a bigger shot than usual,"" Tara said. 

&nbsp;

""Tyler said this batch is shit."" 

&nbsp;

And then I was watching her eyes roll back into her head, and a smile creep across her face as she slowly laid back. But her skin was getting paler and her lips growing blue. She started retching but I didn't turn her on her side. Instead, I just watched. Perfectly imperfect. That was Tara. 

&nbsp;

Not anymore. She was unmoving. I smiled. Because now I had her all to myself. 

&nbsp;

The love of my life. 

&nbsp;

My girl.

Long time subscriber here for my first post. So I got my hands on some acetylfentanyl powder, it's not the first time but the last time was kinda lost upon me since it was a mere 30mg and I never really got high off of it. Even with zero tolerance. That time I ingested it all nasally. But I never really got high. I started with taking maybe 3-4 mg but I think the method of ingestion was the culprit of me never really hitting the spot. So I was wondering if anyone has any tips of dealing with this treacherous substance in powder form? I have about 200mgs of it.

I fell in my bathroom this weekend and broke some ribs and my lung collapsed. I was taken to the hospital where an x-ray determined my ribs were fucked up and my lung had collapsed from the impact. I experienced the worst pain of my entire life. I don't use that phrase flippantly. I had rotator cuff surgery in 2011. It was fucking awful. The 5mg oxy's they gave me didn't do shit and I didn't have an opiate tolerance from regular pill use. The shoulder surgery was bad - breaking my ribs and collapsing a lung was pain magnitudes greater than that. 

That being said, they hooked me up with some IV dilaudid. I think over a few hours I got about 4-5 mg IV dilaudid (in .5mg and 1mg doses, though I could be wrong because my shit was super fucked up). Also, after they got me stabilized I would get 4mg IV morphine every few hours. 

The thing is, I've partied with 30 mg oxys and insulfated 30 mg extended release opanas (before reformulation) and I know what a good opiate high feels like.

I didn't get high from the dilaudid or morphine. I was blown away. Opiates actually work really well for treating pain. I know some of you are going to be like, ""Fucking duh, dumbass,"" but I was really amazed that I didn't recapture any of the glory of those party days with those strong opiates. I was in so much pain that they did exactly what they were formulated to do - treat pain.

/Begin Complaining/
How consistent are the people you buy from? There are different workers all the time and the whole crew is ""under new management"" and sometimes I get a .3 piece that's solid and just looks, tastes and 'cooks'(barely touch it with a flame, literally just warm the water to dissolve it) up to a nice familar colour. 

So recently I get great little chunks of dope, then I got similar points(wrapping and size) but the fucking dope was loose powder again, except this time it was cut so bad there was a film on top when it was in the cooker, and no matter what I did this gross flavorless cut remained in the bottom. Literally felt ripped off. I did all 3 points cause I was upset. I sold 20 grams of hash to get that dope~!! Good thing the hash was 'free'.. I guess. Then I get the 'same' great little chunks, this is the next day~! then later that day I go back thinking ""NOW is when I want to spend money, now is the time to buy before it changes again"" and I get gritty little chunks and it's not as nice as when I got 3 point earlier in the same day, not as bad as when I felt ripped off tho. EDIT: It's actually pretty good, but big surprise~! when the pieces are  solid it's almost always much, much better. I know this can be psychological but seeing all that cut last night really fucking let me down. 

When their stuff is really good I always get the same colour, look and taste when they have their best stuff(I just picked up another 6 points)  It's not too bad but if I just would have picked up kust before this latest reload and after the one where I felt ripped off I would have lots of the best shit I've had in awhile. I'd like to make this last till I work on the 10th and instead of doing 3 points in a day I'd like to stick to my good ol' 2 shots from one point in the evening. I enjoy it so much more when I  look forward to it all day and then allow myself to indulge and shoot up after dark. Sometimes it wont get dark fast enough now that it's spring and I'll go... ""Well, 6PM close enough~! (+~~BLAST~***ahhhh"") 

Some young guy said ""I even scaled these up myself, I know you like chunky pieces"" none of it was chunky, there was like a solid little piece here and there. Nothing like the day before when everything was a solid chunk. I mean how hard is it for a point to be a solid piece? AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO CUT IT FINE JUST DON'T GET SO GREEDY THAT THE WATER LOOKS LIKE SHIT AND THERE'S AN UNSHAKABLE POWDER ON THE BOTTOM OF THE COOKER~! 

Fucking guy. This is why I want DNM dope most of all, I hate getting great solid chunks of dope that have that familar colour, taste and rush, and then getting shit that's cut wrong and fucking makes me feel like I'm wasting money. If the 6 points I just picked up were low quality I'd be fucking livid

Anyway, I can't wait to sample the dark web. And not just the dope(although I'm psyched to try) I figure so long as the pills are real what's better than pharma grade dope, right ? I mean knowing exactly what I'm getting seems even more important with my back and forth on quality heroin as of late.

***QUESTIONS***

***What's on your pharma wish list, and why???***

***Which pills give the best high ?***

***Also, if I'm looking for a great high PLUS LEGS what's a good pill to get?*** 

***What about combos. like for example hydromorphone to come up mixed with morphine for a longer lasting high***

***I'm specifically talking about pills you can shoot. Tho if you want to mention pills thart are great for snorting I'm interested in those as well.***
>////////////////////

So far the only things on my list is Hydromorphone and the cheapest morphine I can find cause if I love heroin chances are I'll love plain old morphine. 

But I'm really ignorant when it comes to what's out there pill-wise cause I've never been lucky enough to have much of a steady hookup when it comes to pills.

As I merge onto the freeway, I notice the driver in front of me.  

Now, here in California, we have *millions* of bad drivers. We have just sooooo many people, so much traffic, that you're constantly surrounded by had drivers: not using lights or turn signals, swerving, cutting everyone off, weaving back and forth through spaces they only just fit into, speeding 20+ mph above the limit, going 30 mph below the limit on the freeway (also illegal). So I'm used to it.  

But the chick in front of me in a black, mid-2000s Toyota Corolla, wasn't just a bad driver. She was extremely intoxicated: speeding up and slowing down, not going when the traffic in front of her moves until I honk, and **non-stop** swerving into the lane to her right (luckily it was empty next to her nearly the whole time we were driving). I thought she was drunk and was gonna kill someone, so I called 911 and reported her, noting where we were, direction we were travelling, what her car looked like, her license plate, and how she was driving. The cops told me they'd put a bulletin out for her, and to keep my distance.  

Well, shortly after the call, she got over (I think on accident because she drifted over halfway, then kinda committed to it) and went to get off the freeway. So, since I was continuing on, I ended up next to her, and slowed to her speed to get a good look at her. It was then I was *easily* able to tell she wasn't drunk. She was nodding off **HARDCORE**; her eyes were totally closed when I first got next to her, until she opened them and shook her head, then looked at me, and I could she her eyes were pinned as fuck; a big smile on her face, a pack of fresh rigs on her dash. She was doped up as fuck!  

So, girl I called the cops on, I'm kinda sorry I called the 5-0 on a fellow opiate addict; I thought you were a drunk. However, I kinda don't.

The key I held is her's alone and sunk into her depths.

Beautiful is the soul where I go to drown.



-Morbo's Lament #663



Kym wasn't from around here.  If you pressed her she might say Persia.  Hanging out with this bleached blond barely ever evoked any exotic or foreign feelings but every now and then Kym would surprise you.  Like her supernatural vibe.



""At first, the gods made us perfect..."", Kym whispered.  



Her face glowed mysteriously over the candlelight.  We had neglected to pay the power bill and the last 3 nights had been dark ones.  Normally we would go out to a club or a bar.  Anywhere with people, lights and life.  But tonight the clouds dumped freezing cold rain over the city so we huddled hush hush quietly within our gloom.  



""And then they grew jealous!"", Kym cried dramatically.  Her wide eyes stared into the darkness and mirrored the flickering flame.  



I could hear the slightest hint of her far away foreign accent.  It was hypnotic and her scent had a touch of myrrh which made me think of her desert blood.  I swear could hear tiny jingling bells in the downpour.  This was the spell my woman cast when she wanted attention.  She was a natural storyteller from days long past but she was also a beautiful modern day American woman.  Tall, thin and curvy with a predatory feline stare...Hell I wanted to screw her so badly but stupid Jason was there gaping at her with his mouth open like a child.



""But why were they jealous?"", he asked.



""Because the gods are beautiful.  They know all pleasure!  And...every sin.  When they saw us in their image the gods suddenly knew fear and doubt.  And so..."", she said reaching for a cigarette and lighting it in the flame.


""And so what...?"", asked Jason leaning forward.



Kym had this hypnotic way she smoked cigarettes where her lower lip hung open just a little and the smoke would swirl there for a second before she would suck it into her lungs.  She tapped her smoke, arched her eyebrow at Jason who looked spellbound for he had never seen this side of Kym.  



""And so they took a part of us...a little piece of you."", she said exhaling, ""This is why we are not complete.  This is why you feel empty Jason.  This is why you try to fill your emptiness with light, with love...with heroin!"", she breathed at him tilting her head and bringing her face perilously close to the flame.



""Get the fuck out of here!  Jesus you're a fucking trip!"", laughed Jason as he scooted away from the candle and Kym.



And then came the knock.



Kym narrowed her eyes suspiciously and looked at me.  I could see apprehension in her eyes which was rare as nothing seemed to phase her.


""Don't open it!"", she warned.



""Naw its OK.  Its just Melo and Dev.  You guys asked for H and here it is!"", said Jason getting up.



I chuckled.  The darkness and foul weather was getting to us.  Kym looked rigid as the wet couple walked in.



""Dark"", smiled Melo who came in.



""Hi."", peeped Dev following behind.



Melo and Dev were our park connect.  When the dealers weren't answering Melo could usually middle man you a bag.  The small price to pay was the bags were probably pinched and he wanted to get high.  So we did.



We all smoked off foil except Dev who rolled up a filthy sweater to reveal a scrawny pin poked arm.  We watched her prep a shot.



""Go easy Dev.  Easy..."", cautioned Melo.



""I am"", she snarled as she tied off her arm.  



""Babe can you come here...?"", said Kym walking into our room.  



Everyone looked at me so I smiled and shrugged.  The hall was pitch black but I could sense her in the dark.  Then her face appeared next to mine.



""I feel it again..."", she said.  



""What?""



""You know...It"", she whispered, ""Death.  Death is here...""



Kym had pulled this on me a few times.  We have scrambled out of clubs, hopped off trains and refused to get into cars.  I figured it was her version of a panic attack but she insisted it was not.



""I'm not leaving our apartment!"", I said.



""No.  Make them go.  It's Dev"", she said holding my face and whispering into my ear.  ""There is a shadow over her...It is here.  With us.  Now...""



""Not making them leave Kym.  Its raining!""



""Death is following her!"", hissed Kym as I walked away shaking my head.



In the living room Melo and Jason played cards.  Kym stayed in our bedroom.  I sat down and looked at Dev.  She was nodding out on the floor.  She was a tiny thing.  All mousy, bedraggled and wet from the rain and fog.  Her eyes snapped open as if she knew I had been staring at her.



""Do you have any juice?"", Dev suddenly asked.  Her childish voice was monotone and sounded like a toy doll.



""No.  Sorry.""



""I like juice.  Fresh juice.  Apples in Fall..."", and then her head slumped forward again.  



The flickering candlelight  gave her shadow the illusion of movement.  It seemed to bend and sway as if it was trying to tear free from her slumped body.  She was so still.  Concerned, I nudged her with my foot.



""Apples in Fall..."", she muttered again looking at me for a second.  A moth floated gently through the space between us.  I felt cold.



""Jason!"", said Kym from the hall, ""Come here I need to show you something!""



Jason looked at me.  I got up with him.



""Jason make them leave please."", pleaded Kym.



""Why?  Its raining and we're playing blackjack..."", said Jason.



""Fuck that!  Get them out!  There is a shadow!"", she said.



""C'mon Kym"", I laughed.



""What is she talking about?"", asked Jason quietly.



""It's one of her things"", I shrugged.



""You don't believe me?  I tried to go to sleep but its too dark.  Like the bad dark!  Cold dark!  And then I heard her!  Dev's mom!  I think she's dead and knows whats gonna happen!""



""Get the fuck out of here!  What are you talking about?"", said Jason stepping back.



""I heard her mom crying in the dark ok?  She said something like 'Baby please stay there...keep away from us!  Stop coming here!  Stay home baby!  Home!'"", yelled Kym hysterically.  



""You guys OK?"", said Melo walking into the hall.  He looked concerned as Kym was crying.



""Hey Melo"", asked Jason, ""is Dev's mom still alive?""



""No.  She died when Dev was a little girl.""



Jason turned white and looked at Kym.  Then he looked at Melo.

I seem to not be taking your guy's advice, which is totally my fault.

This time, I got high. Very high. It was wonderful, the best thing I've ever felt. The day after, I also got sick, very very sick at that. I couldn't urinate for almost 24 hours which was incredibly painful, and I also was throwing up every 2 minutes and couldn't hold even water down. For whatever reason, I decided to tell my best friend that I had been dabbling in opiates, and I don't think I've ever heard someone I cared about so much sound so disappointed in me. At that moment, I decided fuck this, and I flushed any heroin I had left. I want the last memory I have of heroin to be me dry heaving my insides out while feeling emotionally crushed and guilty, and hopefully I'll never touch it again. I'm pretty certain this is the end of my opiate adventures, or at least for a very long time. The thought of doing heroin again makes me cringe and feel sick to my stomach.

I immediately stopped and removed the needle, but the pain has stuck around for like an hour now, hurting sharply by my wrist and forearm, though it's fading now.

So what happened? Did I hit a nerve? Am I gonna lose an arm?

He comes over and the dope isn't even gritty(acceptable..cause the other day I got some with wayyyyyy too much cut and powder and was so let down, all the solid pieces cook up right, look right, smell right and MOST IMPORTANTLY FEEL RIGHT when I IV. So he's distracted and he lays it out, I like what I see it's all solid pieces, maybe a crumb here and there in each point bag but mostly all solid little chunks. He leaves and I open the biggest one right away, looks really nice, but a little weird. I taste it, uh oh, I suckle on it, slight numbing of my lip. So I've already broken a piece of and that crumbled into little pieces, so I take a little toke off some foil-yep, it's not down. Stims are not my thing, and the one time I tried crack I HATED IT. but I'm thinking hey here's something I haven't shot..hmmm. 

So I put some in a cooker, splash it with a little heroin water to go with the plain water already there. warm the cooker, draw it up and shoot it, I guess it would have been much better if I smoked it? 

So I told him look I'm not complaining but I started breaking it up before I even knew what it was. He tells me just don't touch any more and he'll be bag and exchange it for dope, even tho I broke off a piece~! So ...that's cool. Should I try shooting the rest of the tiny pieces? Should I have only smoked it? The more I think about how the DOPE IS GOOD RIGHT NOW the more I'm thinking you know 8 points of d instead of 7 is something I want more than fucking crack. But I feel like I should at least shoot the other little pieces I put in the cooker. If not today tomorrow. I hope the main solid piece he's getting back is enough to get a point of D. I mean it was his mistake and I was honest and he sounded super understanding. I think cause he's new he doesn't want me to tell anyone else. IDK. 

***What should I do???*** 

When I was younger the only way to get coke(at one point) was to let this crack head get some of our blow. So my friend and I did that. and he asked us if we wanted to see ""how it's done"" so we watched. then he asked us if we wanted some tokes, so we each took a few big ones... then I think I was hoping we would stick around but we were like ""ok, thanks man.."" and went on our merry way. We were 17? 18? something like that. And for half an hour it was INTENSE, it was quite the rush. One hour in, headache, my heart is pounding to the point my chest feels painful, I feel edgy and gross. 

This time I thought well it's pretty much the same drug as coke-other than stigma and ROA, so....if I would like to try shooting coke how bad could it be to shoot crack? I don't know if I'll shoot these other little pieces or dry them out and smoke them sometime. 

But I really hope he takes the main rock with him and gives me the other point of d I'm owed. the moment it looked weird I should have stopped touching the bag at all. Stupid. I didn't even really notice to much from iv'ing, tho it was a VERY SMALL AMOUNT- just to be safe. But I mean they buff it, add baking soda etc...IDK if I should be injecting something they expect someone to torch with a flame. 

THOUGHTS? ,

EDIT: I feel kinda weird, def a little stimulated. But I'd rather shoot a point of d now that I'm stocked up than touch the cooker with the crack in it. I was thinking of going downtown to cold cop some day soon then just when I need to drop some hash money I made today -bam~! Best looking dope they've had for days and days. This is how it was when I first told some of the guys on the crew I was selling hash and would be able to afford buying a little more often for awhile, they had these nice solid pieces. and IME with this crew(even after 'new management' ) solid pieces always look right, taste right, cook up with the right -familar-colour and dark enough I know it will fill two syringes easily.... and so on. So anyway, I think I'm going to make up a needle and save that for the daytime tomorrow. It wont be strong but those little pieces are still wet. I literally tasted the tiniest little bit off some foil and reacted like THAT'S CRACK and put it down right away. And yet, I shot the tiniest little bit, go figure. ",1428129061.0

So anyway after making sure I didn't have a spinal fluid leak he actually gave me a script to get through the weekend until I can get ahold of my dr Monday.

Thank you baby Jesus!

So got some oxy 30s the other day and I'm starting to be a little sketched out but can't tell if it's paranoia or legit. Any input is really appreciated. 

They're a relatively new to the market, blue and marked ""A 51"". The imprinting looks pretty consistent, but a couple of them look like they've been a little beat up (nothing more than being in a bottle for a while though). They seem to be consistent with the images from the companies website in terms of color and imprint. I put some water on my hand and rubbed the imprint, it seems to be relatively deep. 

Here's where I get a little worried - they seem to have a pretty pungent smell. Almost of vinegar.  Where I get concerned is I know heroin smells like that (not personally but from what I've heard) and I've heard of these fake oxys with potentially heroin pressed in them. Also, a blue coating comes off when I wet the pill (but it still maintains its blue color fortunately - and is blue all the way through) I've heard mixed stories about whether or not there should be a coating on IRs but I would think that could depend on manufacturer. 

I tried crushing one up since I've heard plenty of fakes are too hard and don't crush well, or clump up, and it seemed to crush into a powder just fine. 

My thinking is that since they're a newer/less known brand, it's less likely that they were faked but I guess who knows. what are your thoughts?

I've found over the past few weeks however, that instead of energy i'm getting tired, dizzy, feeling like i'm about to pass out. Yesterday, I tried dipping into my backup of 10mg hydros.

That post about the atomization syringe was cool and all but not all that useful for powders. Well, hold onto your butts...

[This is the TriVair Nasal with patented PowderWhirl chamber](http://www.trivairdevice.com/Nasal/Novel-and-improved-nasal-delivery)

You know what else that is? Yup, it's a bendy straw.

That website has a lot of info about why it kicks so much ass, but there are also videos where they have people blowing radiolabeled powders into their noses to prove superior distribution. 

The main principle is that when you exhale through your mouth, the flap at the back of your throat closes to block of your nasal passages, unless you consciously keep it open. With the TriVair (bendy straw), you blow the powder into one nostril and, because the flap is shut, the only place for that powder and air to go is out your other nostril, resulting in totally even coating of your sinuses and nothing down your throat.

Read up and Enjoy!

FAQ - no this is not the same as those tribal things where someone else blows something up your nose. The main strength of this is the sealing of your sinuses with your own breath and someone else blowing stuff up there isn't any different from regular snorting... except you might get a little better coverage of the upper passages and its really gross.",1428205079.0

This time, I felt itchy, but it was the itch where it felt good to scratch. Maybe i was too distracted by the itching to notice, but there was no 'high', unless you consider itching the 'high'. I knew at the time that codeine itself inhibits the enzyme that coverts it into morphine, but thought 4 hours would be sufficient time to redose. Oh well.

Last night I thought i would give it another chance. This time, had maybe 240-270mg of codeine after a perfect CWE. Smoked 2 bowls of kush beforehand as I'd heard it was a good potentiater, and laid in bed. This time however, there was no itching, and no noticeable high, only drowsiness which was expected as i was pretty comfortable.  

In r/trees, there was a post a few days ago stating that people who had trouble with edibles should take an antacid beforehand. The thread received a good response and a lot of people who didnt feel the effects of edibles before, did after taking an antacid.

I'm going to try again tonight. Thinking of upping the dosage to 300-350mg (somebody tell me if this is too much, opiate novice here who has yet to experience an opiate high). Does anyone know if an antacid would aid me? Also, any tips on achieving the high?

Edit: Update on the 360mg dose-  Definitely felt this one, but it wasn't what i was expecting. The high is really mild, and creeps up on you. Makes me think that in my previous attempts i did feel the effects but misattributed it to the weed. Next attempt I'll try an antacid prior to see if I can better absorb the Codeine, because 360mg for a mild high just doesn't seem to be worth the hassle. ",1428323075.0

What other medications can help get me through the day? Has anyone ever had success in going to a Dr for prescriptions to help ease through this without explicitly telling them you have a severe addiction?

After I gave Dude his ten bags I pulled around to the closest parking lot and blew em down. I smoked a cig and drove to another parking lot to chill. And holy fuck. Idk what was up with those three bags but I was nodded the fuck out in a WaWa parking lot lmao.

Only reason I'm bothering to share this is b/c I have a prettyy high tolerance; I can usually blow down an entire bundle and function totally normally. But for whatever reason these three bags did the goddamn trick!

quick backstory. I have been on mmt since the end of july 2014. if you're familiar with my comments and posts about it, you know that it is working well for me. I have been clean from illicit drugs since the day I started methadone.

I'm happy with my life. I kind of replaced heroin/getting high with money and being on a ""money making mission"". haha it sounds so corny but it's what I enjoy now. lately I have been thinking about other, actual, hobbies to my life. but I am pretty happy. things are good. I live a nice peaceful (well, more peaceful than it was while I was strung out on dope, at least) life now. I wouldn't trade it for the world. when I get cravings, I read old journal entries I have written during my active addiction. within a minute or two of reading them, my cravings are gone. I never want to feel dopesick again. it's not worth it.

but does anyone else who is living a similar life as me feel like , really boring and uncool and even lonely at times? I feel like .. idk. I feel like a lot of what I miss about the lifestyle is when I used to meet up with my ""friends"". we'd meet up when we were sick and vent about how long the dboy was taking ""ughhhh this motherFUCKER. I'm guna shit my pants right here, right now, if he doesn't show up NOW."" talk about how the lifestyle and everything that came along with it sucked .. ""I'm deadass. I need to go to detox again. I can't do this anymore. I have not a dollar to my name and my family hates me. I'm calling NUMC on monday. you wanna do it with me?""

but then our man would show up and we would get high. I would disperse bags to whoever could shoot me up cuz I couldn't do it myself. (no wonder they always wanted to hang out with me.) we would drive around and blast music and if it was a good money day, cop more dope, and laugh about how horrid our lives were and what big junkies we were.

it was sad, and I was sad about it, but it was like a dark comedy. we would laugh and laugh and joke about all the shittiest aspects of our lives and follow it up with ""...no but really. this sucks. I gotta get clean. let's go to detox together"". but it would quickly be forgotten, cuz things were good in that moment in time. when you're a junkie and it's a day when you have a couple buns stuffed in your bra and gas in your car and maybe a couple bucks left for an iced coffee or a bag of sour patch kids, life is truly beautiful.

ew I really didn't mean this to turn into a ~memoir post~ haha .. it was actually meant to be a post for advice or maybe to commiserate with people who felt/feel the same as me sometimes. I am happy with my life but I feel like such a bored old loser sometimes. (at the age of 24) .. I would never refer to my dope days as the best days of my life, never ever ever. but my memories are so romanticized when they flow thru my head

idk what the point of this post was haha. does anyone feel like me? can any of you relate? I know you all can, but I just need to hear it I guess. I know what I need to do to get through my cravings .. I need to keep busy, and remind myself of how horrible those times truly were. but I just need to know that other people are going through the same thing as me",1428277026.0

I know he's been dabbling in painkillers for a few years now since he was arrested for possession when he was 19. In the last 6 months or so, though, I think he's lost control. He's lost two jobs, quit school, crashed his expensive car twice, lost a girlfriend, withdrawn from my dad and I, and generally stopped showing up for things or making much sense. He calls my dad at odd hours and rambles on about nothing and my dad, who has had two heart surgeries, is worrying himself to death pver my brother. He's nodded out in front of my dad and I and brushed it off as being ""tired"". Neither he nor my family knows about my own use because I have it under control and can choose a time and place. I consider myself to be fairly responsible with it because keeping a firm grasp of other important things in my life makes that use sustainable. I finally confronted my brother on the phone today and he said he'd talk to me about it in person tonight. I'm not judging him for his use, but his life is literally on a crash course to nowhere good and I'm tired of worrying about him. What can I say to him tonight to make him think about his actions a little more, maybe get some things under control, without making him shut down and withdraw further? 

UPDATE: For those who are interested, it went well. I think he was actually glad to talk to someone and we both opened up in a way that ended up feeling positive and mutually beneficial. We talked in the car, which makes it easier because we didn't have to look at each other. That helped make it more honest. We talked about addiction, but we talked more about what he wanted from his life and his future. We made a plan to get him on insurance and find him a new doctor and maybe get some real help for him. I'm less worried now and I think he's going to be better as long as he doesn't get stuck. I've lost some really good friends because I didn't, or couldn't, help them.

I tried hitting up my main dealer, didn't hear from them till about 5-6ish, saying they needed to reup. Damn. 

I begin hitting up one, two, three, four persons. With no reply. My body has now started to uncontrollably sweat. My nose is getting runny. Oh and I forgot to mention I have a tooth in the back of my mouth that a couple weeks ago the bottom half of the tooth completely broke off. So my tooth is extremely sensitive. 

I express to my main dealer that I'm having terrible anxiety and was wondering if she had a time frame for me. 45 minutes. 

I decide to smoke a bowl and watch something stupid on TV to pass the time. 

30 minutes go by, 45 minutes go by, and hour goes by. 

I called her, she is ready to meet. YESSSS! 

We meet and everything is fairly quick. She is nice to me and shows me empathy about being sick and hopes I'll feel better soon. She drives off. 

Right there in the parking lot I begin turning the powder into two shots, one for me and one for my boyfriend. 

He is able to shoot himself easily.  I braced myself for my shot -Relief!- I stab it into my arm carefully, but I can't register it. I try multiple times. But the needle is dull, it is extremely painful. My boyfriend is high, moving and talking slow and sloppy. I am angry and jealous. He tries several times to shoot me and can't seem to register. It is getting more and more painful. I ask him for his needle to try and he says yes, but not before giving me a lecture on asking more nicely as I was snappy. 

*shut up shut up* 

Finally he hands it over, I prick again but its no use. Our needles are way too dull to hit my tiny veins. 

I call back my dealer and tell her my situation and she is willing to give me a few needles after she runs an errand. 

Yes! Relief will come soon. I'm trying to control my breathing to calm myself down. She calls and asks me to drive to a new location. I wait a short 20 minutes for her and she shows.

She hands me not one, but four new needles. I tell her how greatful I am and I will pay for them next time. She tells me its no problem and not to worry about it. 

I transfer needles again, finally register what's left of my shot. 

And

Relief. All symptoms go away. 

I thank JJ that my dealer understood so well what I was going through and how willing she was to meet up with me as promptly as possible. I am extremely loyal to my dealer and only call other people in absolute desperation. I guess my loyalty  has paid off. She is the best. ",1428377540.0

Instead- I have to drive about 40 min to pick her up from her work, drive another 10 min to the paper prescription, then across street to the pharmacy. 
I'm now informed she has to go back to work and cannot wait with me for the prescription... She got 30 of mine and I get 50 of hers. But she gets 90 at s time. Ok so take her back to work, I drive back to pharmacy, and have to wait an hour or so.

I have a certain knack for finding lost things, especially lost things that aren't mine. 


**Tale 1:** 

A couple of friends of mine decided they wanted to take a mini road trip, go drive to the east coast of Florida and abuse some substances. It was myself, George and Cheyanne, we were all young, nearing our twenties and broke as young people usually are. We had just enough money for food, drinks and gas to power George's monstrous gas guzzling beast nicknamed Blue Thunder (It was 1976ish Buick Nova or some shit.). We set out east bound towards the afternoon day sun, blazing a trail across the desolate wastelands most people refer to as central Florida, passing many trailer parks and orange groves along the way. Still piloting blue thunder away from the setting sun we finally arrived in Coco Beach around dusk, remember how I said we were broke? Yea well that led to the drug of the night being Robitussin (I know, ewww). We figured we needed slurpees to wash down this foul concoction, so went to the local 7-11 and started blending flavors. When I left the store I noticed a group of young people outside of their car who seemed to be looking around frantically, phone lights on, scouring the ground for *something*. This is where my lizard brain kicks in, i deduce that if they were looking for something with such focus, it had to be good, no it had to better than good, it had to be *drugs*! So I quietly got into blue thunder and told George we needed to hang out for a minute, he was agreeable so we chilled in the parking lot sipping our slurpees after we dosed. Not much longer and the kids who had been scouring the parking lot decided to call it quits and ride out, I overheard some choice words which implied they had not found whatever it was they were looking for, sweet, now's my chance. I got out of the car and went to where they had been parked, popped on my phone light and started looking, literally in less than a minute I spotted it. As I picked up the baggie my a giant shit eating grin stretched across my face. What I had in my hand was a small piece of plastic separating me from 8 pressed pills, I wanna say they were triple stack blue dolphins but I can't remember for sure, regardless the night had just gotten a whole lot more interesting. I went back to blue thunder and showed my fellow adventurers my score, they were dumbfounded, they literally couldn't believe I had just pulled drugs from the aether. We ended up each taking a pill a piece to kick it off as we already had tummies full of DXM, the roll was strong and beautiful, we drove to the beach and parked. We spent the rest of the night in and out of the car listening to great music, enjoying the beautiful balmy weather, taking turns getting our heads scratched and backs rubbed by our home girl Cheyanne. We stayed up all night, watched the most epic sunrise over the Atlantic ocean just vibrating through a haze of bliss. Once we were coherent enough to move again we started to pack up shop and turned that beast Blue Thunder back towards the west coast and got on out of Coco Beach, thanks for the fond memories, hell of a night boys, hell of a night.

He seemed a bit skeptical when I told him it wasn't me, but I insisted, even  though he said I wasn't in any trouble.

[I don't know, I'm crying.] I'm not sure who to ask. I thought maybe y'all could give me some advice, and I appreciate it in advance.

**TL;DR :: Bottom line, my ~~ex-~~boyfriend is gone. What do you do when a junkie that you love is in the wind? Why do you leave the people you love alone? How do you tell when someone is just not interested in being found VERSUS they are in too deep, and could use some love?**

I met Joe when I was **ten years old**. I'm nearly **twenty-six** now. He always told me that he could always come to me, I would love and accept him, no matter what. All of that is true - I don't care if he's using, I don't care if he's in jail, I don't care if he's made poor choices, I love him regardless and without conditions. I am no longer IN LOVE with him, as I have an amazing girlfriend who I want to have an incredible future with. 

However, the last time we spoke was probably November. We've gone through some periods of radio silence, but this is six months - six months when we're both adults, six months when we've both got bills to pay, six months when we're both making our own choices. 

Two months ago, I worried he might have died. So, I started looking - his phone is shut off - disconnected, there's nothing on Facebook - no I'm going to jail or rehab statues, no rest in peace comments from his friends, nothing. Now, yesterday, in an unrelated conversation with my girlfriend, something was said [it was just a series of numbers - 999], which reminded me of him - not that he was ever far from my thoughts lately, but it kinda brought the fact that he is gone to the forefront of my mind. 

Now, I know he will always love the needle more than he will ever love me. I accepted that long ago. I'm happy - I have a beautiful, intelligent girlfriend who makes me laugh, a nice house, friends who've got my back - that would probably feel the way I do right now, if I dissapeared, family that is mostly on my side, and so much more. He's had those things before, too, but he has never been sober - not once in the entire time I've known him - he'd get off heroin, and switch to meth, or get off meth and switch to opium, or he'd be off the above, and start drinking. 

Now, I battled and beat the bottle - I have over three years off, and he watched me do that - told me how proud of he was of me. I won't say he was the reason I started drinking/using, but I wanted to connect with him in that way. I don't blame him at all for my choices, and have since learned there are way better ways to connect with people, and am grateful every single day that my lady never has to see me with a bottle in my mouth. My life is changing in big ways, and I want him to be a part of my life!

I've done everything I could possibly do from 2,500 miles away - I keep calling - still disconnected, keep checking Facebook, keep leaving messages - ""Hey, where are you? I'm not mad at you. Are you okay? I love you. Call me."" I've checked through local jails - both at home and at play. 

The last time I tried to talk to him proper was probably in February - I'd just gotten arm surgery, and they loaded me up with pain killers, and I'd taken a few too many [small change for y'all, I promise, I'm good.], and needed to figure out how to stop being high for an important conversation. I remember I probably said something like, ""Hey, I need your help, I got myself in a little spot."" No response. I called - phone still disconnected.

Now, this brings me to.. What's my next step? I know his dad still lives in the same house he grew up in - I could send Joe a letter there, or I could send a note to his grandma's house - last I heard he was staying up there. I guess, in theory, I could hit up his sister, but I haven't seen her in almost ten years, and doubt she remembers who I am, or the love I have for her brother. But, what exactly do I say..? What do I do? Do I just give in and let him go? I'd rather not do that; he has always been a major part of my life, and I want him to continue to be a part of my life. **I would never leave or desert him, regardless of what he has done.** If he's homeless, or hungry, or needs a fix, I can help with all those things - I have a spare bedroom, plenty of food, and can help him get the help he needs - if that's what he wants.

To stave off the w/ds till that time, I got some lope and melatonin. I just took about 24 mgs of lope and 5 mgs of melatonin. I want to keep redosing every time I wake up tomorrow and can't go back to sleep. I'm saying I literally want to sleep from now till tomorrow at 1 am. 

Is that dangerous to redose over and over like that? I've taken 72 mgs of lope at once before, just for reference. I know some ppl can take a lot more than that but that is my max dose because lope makes me feel extremely weird.

I know a number of these posts have been made before, but I don't think recently. I'm pretty sure I'm getting locked back up tomorrow. I'm on felony probation atm, and caught a fucked up misdemeanor charge as I just began. Cops called it ""failure to comply"". Said I was smoking weed (I wouldn't smoke weed on probation, stays in your system too long and I get tested weekly), then claimed I threw it (the weed) down a drainage grate. 

Anyways, I report tomorrow and I just have a bad feeling. I've already done a year in a prison facility rehab on this felony charge. Then some months in county here and there. I'm pretty exhausted. How much of my life is going to be spent locked up? I hate it, hate the people, hate the COs, hate the withdrawing on a cold hard floor, but I hate the worrying it causes my mother the most. She's the only person still rooting for me and I know she'll never stop. She's stood by me no matter how much of a fuck up peice of shit I am. She's getting old and she also has pretty severe paranoid schizophrenia. I hate to put her through this again.

Went off on a tangent there. Anyways, got any stories, advice, encouragement? I have 2 years over my head and have completed 2 months of probation.

I'd love to take a tolerance break, but I'm not sure I have the will or the desire at the moment. In any case, I realized that the amount I was spending on them would leave me with only enough money to maintain my current situation, not improve it in any way. It's been rather difficult. I was looking for one for the past two days. My guy finally texted me, right after I got back from spending the last of my cash on more weed. It's the only thing that makes it possible to forget about pills for a while when I can't have them. My tolerance for weed is extremely low - not sure exactly why, but it works wonders for my budget. A gram/week is all I need, and most of the time I don't have to pay for it. It basically rains weed in my area. Tonight I'm particularly pleased I bought it, because it gave me an opportunity to not seek a fronted but expensive blue. If I had asked, I know he would have. I decided not to. Tomorrow's my day off, so it barely counts; I can piss the day away in stoned oblivion. Thursday I'll get my next two. I've gained two more days of ground in the war. I don't think I'll ever want to quit completely. But if I could curtail my use to a fraction of its current rate, I could make it work.

I've got an okay job I don't despise, I've earned back the trust of my family and friends, and I've got a new hobby that is doing wonders in terms of rebuilding my self-confidence. But back in January I reaffirmed that I was indeed loyal to the foil and started doing black again. Now if I don't do at least a point a day I start going through withdrawals.

They aren't too terrible. I get runny shits and restlessness, plus my body produces way too much mucus and my gag reflex becomes sensitive. Worst of all however is the malaise. I started using because I was curious, but I kept using because I was depressed. Now I feel like I have a much better grasp on how to deal with depression, but I suck at powering through withdrawal. I could do it with a week off work and some good weed, but I've become the go-to guy; until we finish training someone new I'll be working almost everyday. 

My dope habit isn't terrible but it's big enough. I burn through my paycheck in a little over a week and the week before I get paid just blows. I've been thinking of doing some scummy shit to get high on these off days. I keep telling myself I'll buy some subs or start tapering down but I never do.

I guess I just wanted to see if anyone here has tapered from a not-too-huge habit successfully. I doubt I have the self-control but I can't afford to fuck things up again.

Wed n Thursday we hustled up enough to get 2...so it varies but pretty much at least a bag a day. So I get paid biweekly and when I run outta money and we have to work well bang subs I get a script and sell most but keep a few. Even with that habit we usually only need a quarter to a half of a pill and were good. Not this time. Did last shot at like 4pm Sunday. Woke up Monday sick af and had work so I ate a half (hadn't been 24 hours and if I eat em I don't get pwd for some reason ) around 10 I had to shoot 2mg and then another 2 at like 4. Got home and we split a quarter so another 1gram. I woke up at 3am again sick af! Sneezing and everything. It really worries me cuz that's our crutch. It wasn't just me either. I took the pills n a pin w me to work but he didn't and only ate the half in am and was shitty allll day :( 
Lame. 
Soo can subs stop working?  It's like an 80/20 split between days on dope per month and subs so it's not like daily. He gets paid Thursday so we only need them till then and I'm fine now (shot a half today )  but now I have like 3 left cuz we never need a lot and I didn't save enough.

Boyfriend has a warrant for his arrest of B Felony in Indiana.,"We are pretty positive it is about this time he sold 3 oxy to this guy that we thought might have been a narc. Turns out we were right. Now almost a year later he got letters from lawyers saying he is being charged for Dealing a controlled substance. He has never been charged with anything like this. The only trouble he has been in was a drunk driving that was reduced to wreckless driving. He doesn't even deal pills. This guy just asked him if he could find any pills and my boyfriend helped him out one time and afterwards he thought it seemed sketchy. So can anyone tell me what they think my boyfriend is looking at? How much jail time is he looking at? We just found out last night about this warrant so we're freaking out. 

EDIT: Has anyone ever heard of a charge like this get reduced to a misdemeanor? 


Results in case any one is going through the same thing:
My boyfriend went to his lawyer and he said that they have been getting a lot of these kind of cases recently and none of his clients had served any jail time and just got put on probation. I don't know exactly how it works out that way though. Also, when he turns himself in all he has to do is go there and bond out, so he will only be in there for a few hours.  We have to lay low all weekend and stay at friends houses that are in a different county because they are really trying to find him. I even went back to our house two days ago because I forgot something, and the fucking cops came into my house when we weren't there and made it obviouse they were in the house. I am pretty sure they even went in my computer because there was an extra chair pulled up next to the computer desk. The next day they went to my parents house because they saw my car drive over there right after I left my house that night and I noticed I was being followed but they didn't pull me over. The cops haven't contacted or went to my boyfriends parents house though and I think it is because they live in a different county. But the reason why we are waiting until Monday to turn him in is because his lawyer has to get this paper work signed and the office is closed all weekend. So if he turns himself in before Monday he will have to sit all weekend and also pay $1,500 bail. But if he just goes in Monday it will be $3,000 bond, which will go to court fees and to his lawyer and shit. The lawyer said that $1500 bail won't help with any of these fees. So yeah, that is what we have found out about this situation. I hope this information can help anyone who is going through a similar situation",1428584107.0

I live at home now, I'm taking night classes and I was working part-time (work went under, no more job). I'm on methadone and I still use H. You're probably thinking ""shit girl your life sounds so perfect so why the hell can't you stop using H What is so goddamn horrible about your life that you just HAVE to continue using?""

It's not that my life horrible. It's that I feel horrible and stressed out on the inside. I don't want to face my feelings and emotions. I'd rather bury them deep with drugs so that I can't feel anything anymore. I'd have to face all the things I did when my addiction was at its worst. Selling precious family heirlooms. Anything and everything in my apartment worth any kind of money until nothing was left. Being a scraggly homeless mess. And then I look at myself now. Going to be 25 this month. What have I accomplished compared to a normal person my age? Abso-fucking-lutely nothing. I'll be 30 in 5 years with most likely nothing to show for it. No fancy degree. My parents are getting older and will probably want to retire and stop supporting me at some point. What if they get ill and die early? I know it's my responsibility to care and provide for my mentally challenged younger brother. We all know he'll never have a decent paying job, his brain capacity just isn't there and that's no one's fault. And so it becomes my responsibility to not only care and provide for myself, but for him as well. So I'm stressed out to the max trying to get my life in order and make things work out so that I won't be hopelessly fucked the older I get. And all this stuff makes me depressed. I feel like I'm hopeless, like I'll never accomplish anything and it makes me not want to even try. 

I've realized that I use so I can escape all these thoughts and not have to deal with it. It took me a long time to figure out what was really bothering me because I never wanted to think about it. I just wanted to be in dope's wonderful bliss and pretend like everything is okay.

I was diagnosed with moderate to severe crohns disease and had my first surgery when I was 7 years old. That was my first of five surgeries with various amounts of remission between them, 7 ears being my longest after surgery my senior year in highschool. The pas 4 years have been rough. My crohns came back after being in remission for a long time. I lsot my girlfriend of 5 years, and three jobs due to my crohns since then. I have been ADMITTED to the hospital over a dozen time in the past 24 months, knee drained 7 times due to arthritis. This all sucks as im a 32/m, I dont look sick, and am somewhat attractive. So I applied for a disability 24 months ago. I was denied the first time, appealed, denied, appealed, and was tod to wait for my court date. MY lawyer I hired said they dont give disability to people my age as they see it for life. They dont care about how bad you feel, you have to meet very CERTAIN criteria. I read a lot on it and it just got depressing. I wasnt able to hold a job down, but there are no programs for me. While waiting for your court date you can onl work part time and thats looked down upon. Im fortunate and my parents who convinced me to apply said move in with us and just try to get better until your court date etc..During this time I started using more. Im prescribed dialudid through my pain management. Its the only that really works and all they give me in the hospital. So with all of those time I was addmitted having sufficient paper work for my pain doc is perfect, even here in florida where they are cracking down. I usually get between 40-100 p 4mg pills every two weeks. It just depends on how I feel and i get to basically ask for what I want. Im smart and have been playing this game for 2 years now without my docs knowing i inject.

So I finally got my court date about a month back, they keep you in the dark and then give you your court date 20 days before it happens. I got more and more stressed, which causes my crohns to flair up. My court date was april 2nd, again my lawyer wasnt all the confident and was actually looking up the definition of crohns on her phone 10 minutes before the hearing. The government doesnt get a lawyer on their sside but they do get a medical examiner, they got a gastro doctor. GREAT. Gastro doctors DO NOT write scripts for pain meds, or generally condone pain meds for most crohns patients. My gastro doctors has allowed me to due to my extreme amout of flair ups regardless of the medication im on. This gastro doctor had the past 5 years of my medical records and just started listing off all of my history to the judge. He mentioned the one time I fucked up in the hospital, I had taken off my gel fentenyl patch and injected it into my IV, it knocked me out and a nurse walked in on me passed out and a syringe hooked into my iv. The previous two night I was left to cry in pain and no doctor or nurse would help, so I did what I thought I had to do, it was stupid. IT was also years and years ago. After he read that I was like fuck, im screwed. Then the judge asks him to finish up and igve his thoughts before interviewing me. The gastro doctor said based on all of my medical records that I was working on my drug issues and should be PUT ON DISABILITY IMMEDIATELY. WHAT HE FUCK DID HE JUST SAY??!! my lawyer looked at me smiling and said ok lets go. The judge didnt ask me any questions, or interview me, or anything. My lawyer said it was the most of the wall/best/quickest case she has ever been a part of. 

I was feeling awful the few days prior to that, and was expecting to go out a celebrate that night. I was however shitting blood and throwing up so I went to the ER again ad was admitted. I just got out yesterday.

So ow its sinking in the I get back pay for ATLEAST 24 months as my current disability onset date was considered to be back in 2009. Im not sure how much that will be but it will be significant. I have NO IDEA What my monthy disability will be but I dont plan on being on it forever. Im going to use all of this to start my own business selling my artwork and furniture. That way I can take care of myself and if I get sick, I dont loose my job, I just work from the hospital. I am so over the moon right now. I qualify for gov insurance now so my parents dont have to pay 450$ a month. I might be able to look at living on my own again, but close to the parents. Im just so excited. I called everyone I could think of and still wanted to post on here. 

I dont know who is going to respond nor why, I just had to let it out. Also no matter how bleak things look, keep doing what you have to do. I was/am abusing drugs, mostly due to me thinking my situation was dire and the rest of my life looked like shit. I however kept at the disability thing even though I was told my chances were NIL. Take advantage of the oppourtunities you have, I know I am very fortunate. I had just been sitting in my room in pain, not working, not going out because that would mean spending my parents money, and basically just staying alive because my family memebrs wanted me here. Now I can do a few things that I enjoy, hang out with friends again, meet new people. I have also stepped down my pain meds alot, for 8 4mg pills a day to 2-4. Now that Im going to be happier maybe I wont be in as much pain and will have a good chance at just quitting straight up unless I get sick and need it.

Ask the pharmacist if they have small syringes for animals such as a cat or dog does not matter just pick one or the other. Tell them you need to be able to inject 10-15cc of Humulin. If they ask if you get the animals script filled here, say no its from the vet, but the vet recommended going there for syringes because their cheaper. I am 4/4 on doing this method and always walk out with a big bag of syringes for the wonderful price of $3.14. It may not work everywhere, but its worth a chance.

I'm an opiate user who has been through hell and back. I was a hardcore junkie back in the mid to late 90's, got clean, started smoking rock, got clean and now 20 years later, I can handle my drug use.

I smoke cannabis daily and its legal where I live. I dabble In other things like blow (sucks out here...) and hallucinogens however opiates still have a special place in my heart! I only use them a few times a year because my circle of friends doesn't fuck with them and I don't buy drugs off the street anymore and the dark net scares the fuck out of me, so I basically keep myself in check that way.

In the past few weeks I've had a bunch of dental stuff done and they've been super generous with the Norco prescriptions! I know they're not Roxies or Oxys but they do the trick for me! (BTW, all the info on DXM/grapefruit juice/antacids was SUPER helpful!)

Anyway, I just thought I'd introduce myself and let you all know that I love to live vicariously through some of you..

On a final note, the Badlands in North Philly used to be my stomping grounds. I hear all of the stories about Kensington and get goosebumps! After hearing all of your stories, it doesn't seem like much is changed in 20 years. I copped bundles there daily, hung out and shot dope in those abandoned buildings and smoked my fair share of rock as well. Were any of you in this sub around for those days?

Stay safe out there and thanks for letting me watch.

Now that our Goverment is Radical-Left, things changed for the better in our society, and of course, things changed in ""the piatsa"" (=""the spot"",""the open-air market"").


1. We have 2 open air markets now, due to a Schism. Due to the Crystal Meth crisis I've mentioned in previous posts of mine, our junkie community decided to practically shun the users that do both H and crystal, because they are very aggressive, paranoid, dangerous. The 'spot' for Heroin only (where I go) is 90% safe. No stealing, no paranoia. I feel wonderful that I can go now and not having to worry about my safety.
2. In the 'other' market (with crystal), my best friend was stabbed 7 times and died, my other lesbian best friend is now officially Schizo due to her crystal use, and -the worst- my boyfriend (who I told u was dangerously experimenting), was murdered 2 months ago in his house by so-called 'crystal' friends of him. Another good friend of mine, Kathrine, 43 years old, was strangled and burned alive in her house from another crystal meth user. I am going through difficult times now emotionally, as u can tell.
3. Crystal meth entered 'glamorous' gay spaces, and as much as I warn them, they don't listen. They believe that since it is used in those glam spaces it's a different deal. They'll see in a few months... Who knows how many people we're gonna lose before awareness about sisa (=meth) rises.
4. Now, on to Heroin: It got cheaper and better again. Medium to Good quality is now 15-20 euros per gram. Greek dealers are rarer now, because they refused to drop their prices. Immigrants don't have many expenses, and followed suit regarding the economic collapse. With only 3-4 euros, you get 300mgs of good dope.
5. The state suboxone and methadone programme, although Free, is still very slow and has a huge waiting list.
6. Personally, I've lowered my benzo habit to just 2mgs of Flunitrazepam a day, I've found a legal job, my artistic endeavors are doing great, and I am in a better place in my life. My heroin habit is a little bit bigger, but stable. No matter how much money I have, I take the same doses every day. Half a gram every morning at 8:30 (10 euros) with a Flunitrazepam pill of 2mgs (1 euro). If it's a work day, another half at 14:30. If I don't work, just 250mgs to 300mgs.
7. Now about cops: The previous government (neo-liberal) was hell. Every other day they took us to police stations to check us and search our clothes. Police buses were every other block. The new government made the police almost disappear from the centre of athens. And they pretty much have left us alone (for now, at least). We are not in a position to buy frantically in under 30 seconds. The small, heroin-only open-air market, is now more relaxed, we gather to socialize even, again, in a back alley. Pretty safe, too.

That's it for now. I'm a little bit tired, or else my post would have been of a better quality. (plus I didn't find my man this morning, I bought mediocre H and I am pissed off... Thank lucifer for benzos.)  ",1428652723.0

Now being on 0.2g of morphine per day freaks me out, it seems like so much. So today I tried splitting one 100mg MSC in half and taking one half at 9am and another half at 5pm. I also took 3 Norco 10/325 today for breakthrough pain. Is this okay to do??? I didn't feel high and my pain was well controlled on it.

I'm trying to keep my tolerance low (somewhat), and save up some MS Contins in case my pain doc decides to pop a urine test on me and terminates me for the THC that's always in my system lol. It hasn't happened in 8 months, but they just had me sign a new pain contract that leads me to believe they might start doing Drug testing. So I want to save a good amount in case they do.

I'm not sure exactly what the discount would be, but I'd put the total cost including shipping at ~$100/box of 50. These are fancy Millipore Millex syringe filters (33mm 0.22 um, individually packaged, sterile, in either PES or MCE). I'll be able to get a more accurate quote once i can gauge interest, and if it comes out cheaper than expected I'll either refund the extra or get some other hard to find tools.

Since these are HR supplies I think this is ok according to the sourcing stuff, and I think the more people that use them the more they'll catch on as a necessary part of safe IV kit.

I figure if I can get 10 people, those people can share any extra filters with other members here if they want.

Because this would involve a degree of risk on my part that I'm not all that comfortable with (buying a ton of filters on my corporate account), I'd like to limit my exposure by only involving people that are active in this sub and generally not overtly sketchy, and I'd also like to do this using bitcoin if possible.

Methadone treatment is very widespread in Ireland as a government initiative following a gigantic addiction epidemic 1-2 decades ago.

Contrary to popular belief, most of these people seem very harmless as in non-aggressive. For some reason they have a reputation as scary people but when you get talking to them they're actually generally a friendly crowd, albeit unfortunately often impoverished and begging.

How do I know the person I'm talking to is an addict? Because somehow, every addict I've met or seen interviewed, regardless of age, gender, where they're from, social class etc, shares one very striking attribute: They tend to speak very slowly, often taking two or three times as long as a non-addict to string a sentence together, and often needing a long pause before answering a question or responding to something the other person in the conversation has said. Repetition also seems to be part of this, perhaps as a way of staying talking while forming the next word or thought - ""Well, I'm going… Going… I'm going into… Going into the city"" when asking for a train ticket for instance. They also seem physically slower, albeit this is not as noticeable as the language thing - they tend to walk slowly, and make slower movements with their hands for instance when writing or reaching into a pocket for money at the shops.

I'm just wondering, is it known what the mechanism of action is for this? Ask elsewhere and you'll get very generic and entirely unhelpful ""drugs just fuck up your brain"" responses. This particular symptom seems to be very endemic among opiate addicts, and very specific to opiates. I've alcoholics and coke addicts, and while some of them have similar speech impediments, none of them seem to manifest in this specific manner, which has accompanied pretty much every long term opiate addict I've met.

Does anyone have info?

I'm not in any way insulting or mocking this by the way, if anything I feel sorry for people whose language has been affected by any kind of medication or drug use, but really I'm curious as to what specific mechanism causes this and why it seems to be entirely confined to opiate addiction and not to other drugs.",1428598741.0

He was counting out a bunch to sell his brother, who is sitting in the passenger seat. After counting them out and handing them over, his bro set them in this little cubby on top of the dash to count out the money. After paying his brother, we drive away. The pills are still sitting on top of the dash as we're driving down some back roads heading home. He accidentally hits a HUGE pot-hole and I see the pills, in slow motion, bounce up, still grouped together in mid-air, and come back down and go fucking EVERYWHERE. 

We get back home and start digging around for them and come up with 28/30 pills. His bro finds 1 more inside the door. However, he is not allowed to take the door panel off to get to it since it was a brand new truck. We can only see it through the spot where the door handle is located. So he takes the antenna off an old car and puts the part that screws into the car down the hole and poorly crushes the pill up. He then takes 4 McDonald's straws from the glove box, (grab a bunch of straws and napkins from any fast food place to stick in your car. It's incredibly handy to have them) tapes them all together to make one long straw and sticks it down in the hole. Now, he can't see down there while he's doing this so it's just a repeat of him snorting like a vacuum cleaner, looking down the hole, yelling ""FUCK"" and repeating. I don't know how much of the pill he managed to get, but I know he got a fuck load of dust and hair.

His bro and I were just sitting back, high, laughing our asses off at the sight.

I fucked up very hard. I took a piss in a public urinal, but when the opportunity arose for me to hit some of my freshly purchased gram of bth, i started to panic because i couldn't find it. I start retracing my steps and lo and behold, I find it in the fucking urinal that I had pissed in just moments ago. Worse yet, I couldn't immediately retrieve it because this drunk hipster had just finished pissing right in that same urinal. 

WD, pretty much by definition, throws all reason out the fucking window. This pretty much defines the addiction, those irrational things we all do to get right. Not high, only right. 

I managed to hit maybe two points out of this sack before the opiate gods decided they would piss in my cereal. As soon as I saw the fucking thing, I took it out of the urinal. It had landed on those plastic filter things (pube guards? Sure looked like a Sasquatch had pissed in it), the side opposite the wall, so hopefully less pee hit it.

 The sack was tightly wrapped in a piece of a plastic grocery bag. I covered the entire thing in hand soap and rinsed it off, praying that the thing was sealed shut. When I grabbed a paper towel to dry it off, I realized that the thing probably wasn't sealed shut because I saw brownish stains beginning to appear on the towel, indicating that fluid could indeed enter and exit the makeshift baggie.

Before all this happened, while I was smoking, an old Asian man slowly limped toward my car. I ignored him until, mid-hit, he knocks on my car window. I thought he was going to give me shit, but instead, in some broken ass English musters up two simple words that just rip my heart out of my fucking chest. 

""I'm hungry.""

I knew I got paid Wed, bills were paid, gas tank was happy. All I had left was $15, but obviously, with a gram of dope in my pocket, I was golden. I didn't need anything til Wednesday, I could def stretch this stuff out. So I get out of the car, ask him to order whatever he wants from this donut shop, and give him the $2 change, leaving me with $5.

Now, since I hit .2, I won't WD til tomorrow afternoon. I'm all out of money. I really need some advice. 

I know pee is sterile mostly, but what other things can i do to save my tar? Is it beyond saving?

I'm sorry I know this question gets posted all the time but I'm just curious about the affinity you of oxymorphone,1428728679.0

I've heard it all and I'm aware of the risks (which are none in my books if your not an idiot and dont respect it like really potent heroin your gonna regret it) and in the reason i do it is cause I've tried every type of heroin i can my hands on and they just suck. Ill inect anywhere from .2 to .5 and i will get a nice glow for a few mins and thats it. $150-170 later and im no higher then when i started.
Well then I found fentanyl powder. Can get 100mg for bout $110-$150 USD, which is a killer deal for someone like me considering most people can take a patch and just do pieces throughout the day and maybe even last a day or two. And prices on street where i am for a patch 75ug/hr is anywhere from $100-$175 and they consist of about 8mg of fentanyl.  So at $100 for 100mg or pure powder is a deal that cannot be passed up. And this shit is the real deal I've never came across anything in the opiate family this strong before. I won't even share with any friends on account of it's potency not out of greed. 
First time I got some I called a buddy and we went out and I started getting tokes ready on tin foil. And I'm talking TINY lilttle tokes and we each did one. Hes daily H smoker and after this one toke he was sooo hi i did one for myslef and look over and he slumped over and unresponsive and his lips were purple so i had to call 911. So I do not want to experience that again so I dont share with friends because theres no way in telling there tolerance and I couldnt live with myself If I murdered someone with dope.
Anyways Onto the question, Since I usually smoke It but my true love is that dang needle and this stuff is way to strong to eye out. I did it once with such a small amount and i missed (luckily cause might of been to much) and even without hitting the vein i blacked out for bout 1/2 hour. An I barely used anything like half a match heads worth of fent and like 10 units of water. So I need detailed instructions on how to figure out how to dose up fentanyl to prepare for injections with non lethal amounts, I have a scale so no worries so please my fellow fenta-heads let us rejoice in mankinds greatest invention and help a fellow fenter out",1428716601.0

I like to think the http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park experiment gives a better example of self destructive addictive behaviors. I tried to explain to someone what I see as the basic thesis; that self destructive addiction is linked the distress caused by fucked up environmental and depressing social conditions. It makes me think of the David Foster Wallace quote http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/200381-the-so-called-psychotically-depressed-person-who-tries-to-kill-herself

A proper explaination also of course has the addition of human psychological disorders, clearly a lot of us are driven to bliss when our brains don't function properly (not sure if the first part includes PTSD sufferers or not, but assume that's included). So I think Rat Park allows us to make the logical assumption that addiction appears to be cyclical and progressive because presumably (excluding those unicorns that can use responsibly) the longer you use the more fucked up your surroundings and problems become. This creates the Herculean task that those of us who wish to get clean (those that have accepted their use for one reason or another are cool in my book, it just wasn't for me).

ORT gives us a chance to be stable pharmacologically in order to make our lives better. I've been ready to quit for a long ass time, I've detoxed willingly more times than I can count. The fucked up thing is that my life never even got that bad, but the work needed to fix it seemed insurmountable. Coupled with the bitch that PAWS is in addition to the life of a 23 year old in today's America always led me to the conclusion that it's hopeless and if I don't get some mental relief I'm jumping off the GWB. Thankfully I had some hope that life will get better if I held on for a little longer.

Since it's only been three weeks I might be in the honeymoon stage, but the fact is Ive made noticeable steps that seemed impossible. As I said I've been ready to quit for a while, and trying hard, but even thinking about the work I needed to do led me to relapse. And when I would relapse I'd beat myself up and binge, leading to more damage done. I agree with a lot of things that twelve steps preach, and I'm jealous of people who it works for actually because fellowshiping and the support that it provides are really special and unique. But the industry that has grown from it makes me puke in my mouth and the requirement of being submissive along other Puritanical policies turned me off. ORT makes sense to me, I think anyone who is ready to quit 100% but tries abstinence and fails due to life being too fucked up to handle or make progress without dope will find some help in ORT!",1428701956.0

I kinda remember Kym screaming, me smashing a beer bottle into some guy's face and then a pulsating, flashing mind fuck memory of trying to curl up on the floor as my ribs, skull and spine were kicked and punched repeatedly by a ring of bellowing psychos.  And in my own damn apartment surrounded by my so called fucking friends. 

After the cops left Jason busted out the drugs we stole from our guests when he yelled ""Cops!  Run!""

We rummaged through abandoned jackets and purses and found $126, smokes, weed, coke, heroin and even acid.  Jason tossed the cash to me for rent.  As usual we squeaked by.  Everything was due in 3 days and now I was actually ahead.  I said nothing about that because I was the asshole dumb enough to have rent and utilities in my legal name.

Much like my personal stash of drugs (not the fake one I let Kym pilfer) I had to hide this money from the paranoid and creative junkie minds that knew there was cash somewhere.  Hiding it under the computer cost me $35 bucks.  The clever wall plug panel was a $40 loss.  No use ranting and raving about it.  Kym and Jason have perfectly blank, angelic faces.  

So I found a new place.  Fuckers.

Kym was carving a mohawk out of Jason's long, stringy hair.  His hair was blue a week ago but now faded into a toothpaste/algae green.  I held frozen peas to my swollen head.  Blood and icy water mixed with the black mascara Kym painted onto my eyes in an Egyptian/zombie theme.  Red and black ichor dripped down my arm.  

We snorted the drugs.  The night grew softer and kind.  Love filled our hearts as I relaxed within the bubble of my insanely high brain.  The TV is beautiful.  I was raised by TV because my mom was always gone.  I had no idea what we were watching but hell -life is good.  The jerk I hit with a bottle was forgotten like the cops.  Sure I still remembered his friends because my body bled and ached but Jason's bumps of H with coke melted away this rude reality... And now my aura began to glow nuclear bright.  I was drifting into the cosmos.

A rattling noise came from far away.  Like seeds in an empty pod.

""You ever feel like there's another world just beyond this one..."", wondered Jason as Kym shaved off his long locks of hair.

""Yeah"", I sighed because I could feel it right now.  ""I think the other world is a spiritual plane...""

Then I heard the noise again and looked around.  But there was only the TV so I melted back into the couch.

""Did you guys take that acid?"", asked Kym as she squinted to focus her eyes in order to keep the mohawk straight.

""Oh yeah...."", said Jason reflectively.

""What the fuck is that noise?"", asked Kym as the rattling turned into a faint tap tap tap.

Jason and Kym stalked into the kitchen warily.  

""Its down there"", said Jason pointing at the cabinet under the sink.  A faint girlish giggle can from inside.

""What the fuck!"", said Jason opening the door.  

A tiny doll of a homeless street kid emerged.  Dev.  Her hands were covered in blood and some of it was smeared on her face.

""Are you OK?"", asked Kym.

""Just hiding"", smiled Dev standing up.  

""From the cops?"", I asked.

""No no no.  The Drowned Boys"", said Dev in her weird flat doll voice.  ""The Drowned Boys walk tonight.  One was here.""

No one liked Dev.  Her mind had been so far gone for so long she was a pain to deal with.  Usually her boyfriend Melo watched over her but tonight she stood alone and bleeding in our kitchen like some lost circus freak.  My glowing high was fading fast looking at her.  Her tiny, frail frame was layered in sweaters and jackets but her eyes were wild things.  Always so far away and gone.

""Ok well we gotta get going"", said Kym who hated her because Dev gave her the creeps, ""So you need to use the phone?  Call Melo?""

""Or a bandaid?"", I asked though Kym glared at me.

""No.  I am protected by blood.  You people though...you walk with Drowned Boys.  You need to open your eyes..."", Dev droned.  Then she walked out our door.

""Fuck me!  Look at this shit?"", said Jason from the kitchen, ""We got any bleach or 409?""

On the cabinet door where Dev had hidden herself was a circle drawn in blood.  Four trailing smears of blood from her tiny fingers clawed downwards from the bottom of the circle.

""I swear she cannot ever come in here again!  There is something so fucking wrong with that chick..."", said Kym covering her mouth as blood dripped from the circle.

""Lets go get a drink"", said Jason as he snorted more bumps of coke and H.

I fixed Kym a few bumps and did some as well.  The coke propelled us to move and the surreal soft focus of the LSD made the room wobble like we were underwater.

""Man that was Satanic shit"", said Kym as she sprayed cleaner over the bloody symbol.

""What is she talking about?  Who are the Drowned Boys?"", Jason asked helping Kym wipe up the mess.

""Who cares?  Dev is insane and Melo is a Saint.  The real question is who has money for drinks?"", I asked looking at Jason who grinned.

""What about up there in the light?"", said Jason innocently looking at my latest cash hiding place which was the light right above us.  Fuck.

""Hey it OK"", said Jason soothingly, ""You just aren't good at deception!  But the light is pretty obvious for one thing no one dusts and look how clean that fucker is!  Maybe try your math books next time?  Or a rock outside?""

 On the way to the bar we passed by Dev who stood in a phone booth.  We walked by quickly hoping to avoid her eyes.  But Dev never acknowledged us.  She just kept whispering into the phone, ""Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello..?""",1428700054.0

I have read that snorting will work, but will be wasteful. Any tips to make this work more effectively (preferably snorting powder, not water). Would snorting lemon juice beforehand make the heroin break down in my nose to salt and be water soluble? 

On an aside, is plugging super ineffective if you have not had a recent (24 hr+) bowel movement? Needless to say, I haven't, and plugging was SUUUPER weak today. 

On another aside, anyone have any general info/experience about this Indian ""brown sugar"" that you could share with me? Anything would be appreciated.

Well, I had to see if it was true so I went to his facebook page and turns out he was murdered early this morning.  I hate to say this but the guy asked for people to track him down.  Aj, the decedent, CONSTANTLY would just run off with hundreds and even thousands of dollars from people when he middled for them.  After speaking with his cousin it was revealed to me that he was with someone and got shot.  Of course there were casualties left in the wake of his mistakes and the violence because he left behind a wife and 6 year old son.  Such a sad story.  Be careful out there fam, there are people that will hurt you for stealing or running off with even what you might think is something miniscule or trivial.  Be safe all.  😳 ",1428812389.0

Jason sat across from explaining why stealing things is part of the American Dream and Kym nestled into my side and stroked my back.

""Like TVs and shit..."", said Jason, ""You know how many TVs this country throws away every fucking day?""

""Oh babe I love you sooo much..."", murmured Kym rubbing her face into my chest.

""You guy's can't be here.  You need to order"", said the waiter blandly.

""I've been trying to order"", I said.  ""I'd like a coffee.""

""No them."", said the waiter looking at Jason and Kym.

""I'll have some Coke"", smiled Kym as she sat up straight.  ""Oops, I mean a Coca-Cola!""

""Nothing for me"", said Jason, ""I'm not here you know?""

The waiter left.

""What a rude little man"", said Kym settling back down against me.

Mr. Maru walked slowly by the window.  Kym banged on it and waved.  The mask he wore in public was black material and faceless but he could smoke his long filtered cigarettes out of it.  He neither waved or acknowledged Kym.  He just slowly walked into the diner and sat down at a table far across the room.

""Why is he over there?"", shrugged Jason.

""Jason!  I think I see Caesar..."", warned Kym.

""Oh he's OK.  Caesar is cool.  None of that stuff matters anymore right buddy?"", said Jason looking at me with me with a weird smirk on his face.

I had no idea what he meant so I looked out the window again.  The fog completely obscured my view.  The traffic and streetlights were hazy glowing orbs receding into the distance...

""Hey you guys holding?"", I asked hopefully as the dope sickness was in me.  ""Man I would love an oxy...""

But Jason was gone.

""I think Jason has some oxys from Melo's guy.  He'll be back."", smiled Kym rubbing my arm reassuringly.

The waiter came back instead.  No coffee.  No Coca Cola.  I began to sweat and shiver.  Muscles are one thing but now my bones ached.

""Hey where's my coffee?  Or her Coke?"", I demanded.

""Why?"", answered the waiter.  ""She doesn't need anything.""

I looked at Kym who shrugged.

""I'm gonna see if Caesar or Mr. Maru have any oxys"", I muttered while standing up unsteadily.  

I felt dizzy.  The room wobbled and warped as if viewed from inside a goldfish bowl.

""You're going to leave me babe?"", asked Kym in a worried tone.  ""Again?""

""Be right back dear"", I smiled as I walked unsteadily across the diner.

All these people.  Who were they?  No one familiar.  The floor was unsteady and bouncy like it was rubber.  Outside was the blackest night.  When I got across the room I couldn't find Caesar or Mr. Maru.  I looked around at all the strangers eating and drinking in red vinyl booths.  Where did they go?  I tried to walk back to Kym but she was gone...Maybe I went the wrong way?  I walked back but all around me was nothing but strangers in red vinyl booths...

I found an empty booth and sat down.  The waiter came over.

""Where did my friends go?"", I asked.  Inside my heart I felt a sadness that echoed of things long past.

""It's only reserved for you"", snapped the waiter who walked away.

""What?"", I said.  But the waiter kept walking so I yelled, ""WHAT THE FUCK YOU SAY?!""

""Hey!  Hey wake up!  You're yelling again!"", came her voice from the dark.

A light switched on.  I was home.  I looked over at my wife who looked at me with a concerned look on her face.

""Jesus look at all that sweat!"", said Sharon mopping my face with a towel.  ""Are you sure you're Ok?""

""Yeah."", I sighed, ""Just gotta shake this flu.  Do you think you can get me a glass of water please?""

""Sure honey"", yawned Sharon while rubbing her eyes.  It was 2:30am.

When she was gone I reached beneath my mattress and found the canister.  I opened it and looked inside though I knew the contents by heart.  There would be 1 whole pill and a half pill.  I put the half pill in my mouth and chewed.  Though it was a lie-I felt relief spiraling over my sweat soaked bones and the nausea was pushed back.  This half wouldn't get me high but I would feel it.

I looked over at my phone.  My phone showed the text.  Jesus, I could text him and be done with this madness.  Or...I could eat a third of that other pill tomorrow morning and limp into Day 4....Fuck I feel so sick.  So cold and angry that it has come to this.  Again.

Well?  Sick for another 2 or 3 days?  Or just answer the text?

I answered the text as my wife came in.

""You'll beat this bug!"", she smiled reassuringly, ""You're strong!  Lets change the sheets because you have soaked through them!  Wow and gross honey!""

""Yeah"", I muttered as I put down the phone.  My shame felt cold like the sweat soaked t-shirt I wore.

I now felt fine and rested on crisp new clean sheets.  My wife kissed me which was nice because I know she is terrified of catching my so called flu...Oh well.  Hopefully she never catches what I have.  Never.

I've seen too much.  It hurts too much.  One of these days I must finish this thing.

When the light snapped off I quietly open the pill canister and eat another half.",1428808836.0

my normal DOC is blues and Opana, but I got a handful of Dillie 8s the other day. After researching the fact that bioavailability is terrible any other way than IV, I grabbed a rig and went to it. 

I've only got a few left and want to get the most of them, so here is my question. Is there a point in doing multiple washes on these? at first I was just eating the binders etc out of the spoon but I'm thinking that might have been a waste.

I have 3 spoons sitting here with the residue from a D8 shot in each one. Is it worth rewashing each? should I put all 3 together and do a single shot from them? should I just lick them clean and say screw it? (They are all from the last couple of hours. I know about cotton fever so won't do it after they sit for too long)

The reason I ask instead of just doing it, is that before these my only IV experience was a friend hitting me. I'm not good at hitting myself, so if a rewash is pointless I don't want to bother stabbing the shit out of myself.

Last night I had my largest offer. This guy negotiated with me for a while and our end agreement was basically $300 to give him the panties I was wearing and watch him jerk off. I couldn't say no. Then he comes at me offering $500 as a front to buy more underwear so we can meet regularly, and every time we meet if we do the same routine I'll get another $300.

The dose is much much smaller than you would take of suboxone/subutex, as apparently it works well for chronic pain..

The last time I did it, I did Poppy seed tea and then split a half gram of coke with my buddy. It was the most euphoric I've ever felt, beating even MDMA in euphoria or atleast I prefered the type of euphoria it provided.  That time though I almost OD i think as at the end when I snorted my last fat line my heart would beat very fast and then very slow, i also literally poured sweat, within a few mins there was a imprint on the sofa i was sitting on.

anyways that kinda scared me, but today I did some poppyseedtea while my buddy (only second time doing opiates) popped 2x 10mg oxy instant release.  i decided i wanted some coke so i picked us up just a half g again and after waiting till after the peak of my PST we did some coke.

Its really nice, its like a 2 pronged dopamine facial.

i kicked 100% cold turkey, i had cash a vehicle and nuthin but will holding me back (tho at day 2 or 3 i couldn't get a few feet from the bathroom, much less ride my motorcycle to philly anyway) after 4 days i had to get outa my parents(i was just staying there to kick, i had told them i was a junkie in the hopes my dad the successful drug and alcohol counselor active drunk for the 40 years till it killed him would get me into some kind of med. detox withdrawal, no subs of either kind existed so options were limited, that fourth day i left the 'rents with them screaming that i'd be high in an hour, i didn't matter of fact i didn't touch an opiate for 5 years i drank smoked reefer benzos just no opi.
Then a year or 2 I fractured both tibia in my legs in a drunken 4 wheeler accident at 4am, I was doing the couch tour so was basically homeless had no insurance and couldn't wear 2 casts to the knee, use a wheel chair and my only was transpo was once again me trusty old 800 honda shadow moto, after about 4 months on crutches and 8 with a cane, now I just do the pimp stride but not cause I think im cool, after the percs ran out I caught another habit, caught and lost them time after time.
it had been about 6 years since my first trip to the clinic, times had changed, dope made it to the burbs here in the northeast (dc-boston) and they put me on methadose(the pink shit aint methadone, google it) 
I got it together one day I bought a beer to celebrate a new apartment 5 years later I moved out and threw that beer away, I had been a hard drinker since a very young age, not to mention any drug I could find, while on methadose I quit booze,pills,cocaine/stims I smoked about 3.5 grams of reefer a week after work once the kids went to bed and spent the next 44,000 days going to the clinic going to work and raising my kids, my marriage wasn't perfect but who's is.
About ~3 years ago my wife wanted a divorce after those 20 plus years, i was working alot she was a depressive person anyway so i was kinda blindsided. I fell off the deepend ordering hundreds of xanax & klonopin, started hanging in bars to meet chicks and hear the band ""i wasnt gonna drink, shit I dont even think about it anymore""
I had even convinced myself i wouldn't even like the taste I was wrong there were no seats at a restaurant my wife and kids were away it was the day after thanksgiving and i stayed home to work, i sat at the bar and ordered my old bar order like those years had never been between that day and the last day i drank, since I started chipping a few bags and did well just using 1 or 2 times every few months. But drinking tons getting in trouble with the methadone clinic for drinking caught 2 more dui's, 15-20 bar fights, brain scans broken bones 4 suicide attempts, started self-injuring again(cutting, i did it as a teen) many horrible relationships with people as broken or more broken than I am.
Im in either a rehab/mental or physical hospital for 3-5 days every 2-3 months.
So we get to know, I sold my house which was paid for I haven't worked in about 2 years but it was trashed and I had child support and taxes to pay but I still have about 6 stacks left of the 90k i got 3 months ago while using just a few bags of smack, drinking abit and id taken a xanax that day (I didn't have a benzo habit) but I had a seizure fell and dislocated my shoulder, went to the ER they put it in gave me more percs and sent me home, I got home got out of the car (my dealer was there :>) fell, and had a second seizure, dislocated my shoulder again (2nd time in 2hrs) and fractured the socket this time and got more percs, they ran out i didn't go to the doc and its just now about 75% better, i'm gonna kick I have about 48mg of suboxone and a few 1mg klonnies i know I can do it, I have before but I had a bit more stability in my life . 
Im using about 3-5 bundles a day and maybe 40$ in crack 2-3x a week, i never liked it much but it counters nods, i never use it unless Ive been on dope, I never meant this to be so long but life has been crazy as hell lately so I guess i needed to verbally vomit(or maybe its the rock)
 I just wanted to post this self portrait i took with that new android cam feature that uses both front and rear cams at the same time.

[grammar nazis] take into account that im i did 5 bundles, half a gram of rock, 2mg of kpin and a pint of vodka 7 smoked some blueberry headband and I'm not much of a writer sober   ",1428909714.0

I'm on Methadone.,"Hi..so I go to group meetings twice a week, where I'm drug tested once a week. I'm on methadone and have been for almost a year. As part of being on methadone I go to these group meetings at different facility than where I receive my methadone. I get drug tested at both places. I'm go on my own accord, I'm not in any legal trouble that's mandated me to attend(like most of my group mates are). So I get a letter from the place I attend groups at saying I'm being discharged. I just attended a group there the day before and no one said anything to me, so the letter was a complete shock. My counselor just started last week and this is her first job in the drug field. They assigned her to me, as I'd be an ""easy case"", according to the director of the group meeting place. So I call her and she tells me I came up positive on two drug screens(both saliva tests). Once for opiates and once for suboxone. Both times methadone also came up on the test. I am in total shock as I haven't take anything aside from Methadone. Also if I were to take suboxone and methadone together, Id go into precipitated withdrawal..I'd get really sick...so I can't imagine anyone doing that. Naturally she doesn't believe me. I'd heard people complaining of coming up positive for various substances in group, but I'd always thought they were lying and they didn't want to admit their use. Now I'm not so sure. My question is how could this happen? I can see a test coming up wrong once, but twice? This is crazy. I'm totally stressed out about this. I don't get how this is possible. I don't really trust this place with my care now. I feel like I'm going to be railroaded into them assuming the test is correct. I'm supposed to meet with the director sometime next week, to see if I can keep attending meetings there. The more I think about it the more I want to find a new place to go. The counselor from group meetings said she thought I'd benefit from inpatient rehab, based on two incorrect tests. I am fuming. My drug tests from the methadone clinic only show positive for methadone, but weren't administered at the same day time as the group meeting place. A side note, I asked her why she didn't call me and she says she did. She read off some phone number that I'd never heard of. I explained that wasn't my number. I've received calls from the secretary there before, so I know my correct number at least used to be on file.

For way too long,"Title explains it, ive been going back n fourth between subs and dope a lot the past few weeks. I have my reasons n excuses, I was with my family for afew days and I had a job interview a week ago, both of which I stopped doing dope and went on subs for several days, the longest being about five days before I ran out of subs and then just waited until I had the sub outta my system and proceeded to go get high. This has been going on for along time, though.

I have several issues going on, personal ones mostly (besides this drug problem of fucking course) but the bottom line is that I make excuses for myself to use and get off subs. I save so so so much money by being on subs, I can pretty much make three strips last me a week or even eight days if I stick to small increments, which I do. I FEEL better on subs. I AM better on subs. But my dumbass only buys like two subs for twenty bucks (luckily, they are usually ten sometimes fifteen bucks in Philly) to last me 4 or 5 days. Then, when I go down to the hood to cop subs, I spend my fucking ""sub money"" on two or three bags of decent dope - that still only lasts me a high for an hour, more like just getting well. 

Thus, I hav realized I am pretty much just getting ""well"" on either of these paths, half assed sub maintainence (maintained by myself, lol how well can this work out) or doing a measly 2 or 3 bags a day which barely keep me well. As I said before, the subs are cheaper, keep me well longer, and I am able to live a half normal life. 

I have in no means been on a run in terms of my dope use since early January. It has pretty much been off and on with subs alternated between 2 or 3 okay philly stamps. 

A lot of you know where this is going... Of course I want to pick up a bun and get high as fuck, I truly haven't gotten a decent high since January... I almost wanna reward my not-really-sobriety with getting bent. All in all, it feels like my tolerance is getting so high that I would have to do half a bun to get any nod going. I both wanna stop this run that has been my life the last year since I really started doing dope, but the idea of not using dope at all, period, really fucks with me.

I find myself trying to give a lot of advice on here, sometimes crappy advice, but I'm stuck in more ways than one. I haven't posted in a while but I just wanted to share, in case it resonates with someone else. Any advice is definitely encouraged and appreciated, Maybe I just need to hear ""it"" (whatever that may be) from someone else. I swore to myself I would stay on subs after my birthday about two and a half weeks ago and i just picked up a few bags yesterday.

So in November I was living with my grandparents for a month to save up money for school. I had one semester left to be a software developer. I've been on my own since I was 16, supported myself, never needed help. It was great to relax and take some time to have someone cook for me, someone to do my laundry. Well things were going too good so I ~had~ to go and catch myself a felony narcotic charge and sit in jail for 4 months. While incarcerated,come to find out my grandparents felt the need to clean my room out and find the 1000 rigs and hella para. I had. So midway through my sentence my grandfather comes to visit and tells me I'm kicked out, and I will not be able to receive any of my belongings I've worked so hard to get my entire life until I pay him the $600 he loaned me for my school books. at the time I figured that's nooo big deal. I got $2000 in the bank from my financial aid! Little did I know the irs took that money out with a tax Levi for noting paying my student loans from the first time I went to college. So from there I figured I'd write my ex girlfriend because I felt bad. She left me 2 months before I got incarcerated because I was a huge prick to her and she couldn't understand why...she thought she was ugly, fat, plain undesirable, little did she know the effects of herion. So I explained it to her. My addiction overtook my love for her. Amazingly she gave me another chance! She moved back home with her parents after she graduated college to start her future...little did she know I was going to be there to mess that ️future up. 
So I get out of jail, move in with a buddy, that didn't work out so well my girl loved 2 hours away and I was constantly driving to be with her, it felt like a whole new love. I changed my addiction onto her, I never felt to happy! Eventually she talked her ma into letting me stay there ahh it was great I felt like I had a home, without anything of mine obviously but materials items, for the first time in my life, don't mean anything to me....for a little bit...and 

The depression started coming back...I moved away from all my friends I stopped using, started to get un happy...so what do I do?!? I grab a rig, dilaudid, and tie one off...end up in jail for a few days with new charges and a PO hold. Get out, break down to my girl tell her I'm sorry it was not worth it...

She stuck by my side but unfortunately her parents didn't...they kicked me out and I broke her heart. She had no idea her mom was going to do this...I'm so sick and tired of hurting her...I want to let her go so she can have the life she deserves but I don't want to be without her....I love this amazing beautiful women so much, why do I keep hurting her?!?! Here I am..homeless sleeping in my car depressed as ever...I want to get rid of this pain forever, but that would hurt her so much I can't do it...

>Tianeptine is a full agonist at the μ and δ opioid receptors with negligible effect at the κ opioid receptors.

I dosed 50mg to see the effects, got a massive uplift in mood, and a definite opioid high.  It only lasts 2 hours, and I'm now past that mark but still feeling the opioid itch with a nice afterglow setting in.  No mood drop.

I don't do opioids anymore (apparently), but this was a really interesting find..  its a completely legal nootropic too.  Thought I'd share my experience.

This may be of use to others for dosing and harm reduction purposes.

My contribution:

All doses are estimates based on Fentanyl HCl. Do NOT rely on my dosages alone for any purpose! Research and cross-reference, titrate, and start low.

**Stage 0: Baseline**

* 0 mcg fentanyl ingested
* Normal mood
* Normal social interactions
* Normal tiredness (ie 6 hours after waking up)
* Not thinking about breathing; breathing rate is normal

**Stage 1: Threshold**

* Dosing
** Infrequent user: 10 to 20 minutes after 50 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops
** Frequent user: 5 to 15 minutes after 75 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops
* Noticably but subtly enhanced mood
* Normal social interactions
* Normal tiredness
* Not thinking about breathing; breathing rate is normal

**Stage 2: Coasting**

* Dosing
** Infrequent user: 20 to 45 minutes after 100 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into two doses of 50 mcg each (once at T=0 and the other at T=20 min)
** Frequent user: 15 to 30 minutes after 175 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into two doses of 87.5 mcg each (once at T=0 and the other at T=10 min)
* Overtly enhanced mood
** Physically feeling warm, possibly mildly itching - especially around face and nose
** Emotionally feeling of security and comfort in surroundings
** Spiritually feeling of well-being
* Improved social interactions; more sociable than normal and better in doing so
* Noticably more awake
* Not thinking about breathing; breathing rate is slightly slower than normal

**The Sweet Spot**

In my opinion, the sweet spot for fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops is in the boundary between these two stages.

You can identify this spot (approximately) by noting that:

* When you take a few tads less fentanyl you definitely feel less euphoria but about the same amount of physical side effects
* When you take a tad more fentanyl you don't feel much more euphoria
* When you take a few tads more fentanyl you may feel a little more euphoria but it comes along with too many negative physical/motor side effects (breathing, pupils, nausea, speech, etc.)

For an inexperienced user I might recommend taking 2 doses of 50 mcg at T=0,30 followed by 2 doses of 50 mcg at T=60,90 and then a dose of 10-25 mcg every 30-60 minutes as needed from there.

**Stage 3: Nodding**

* Dosing
** Infrequent user: 20 to 45 minutes after 200 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into four doses of 50 mcg each (T=0, T=25, T=60, T=120)
** Frequent user: 15 to 30 minutes after 350 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into four doses of 87.5 mcg each (T=0, T=15, T=45, T=75)
* Overtly and outwardly enhanced mood
** Physically feeling warm, possibly strong itching all over
** Emotionally feeling HAPPY
** Spiritually feeling of well-being
* Overconfidence in social interactions; probably giving signs of being intoxicated (slurring speech, nodding, constricted pupils, breathing through mouth or deliberately, etc)
* Possibly nodding off to a very light but pleasant sleep
* Possibly thinking about breathing; breathing rate is noticably slower than normal

**Stage 4: Discomfort, or More Bad Than Good**

* Dosing
** Infrequent user: 20 to 45 minutes after 250 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into five doses of 50 mcg each (T=0, T=25, T=60, T=90, T=120)
** Frequent user: 15 to 30 minutes after 427.5 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into five doses of 87.5 mcg each (T=0, T=15, T=30, T=45, T=75)
* Mood enhancement is clouded by feeling of discomfort and anxiety about breathing
** Physically feeling too warm, possibly too itchy
** Emotionally feelings are mixed between pure happiness and anxiety
** Spiritually feeling of unease, apprehension
* Negative impact on social interactions due to outward manifestation of anxiety and intoxication
* Trying hard to avoid nodding off because when you do, you wake up gasping for air
* Definitely thinking about breathing; not sure what breathing rate was before you got high; worried that autonomous breathing rate is close to 0

**Stage 5: Rushing and Panicking**

* Dosing
** Infrequent user: 20 to 45 minutes after 300 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into six doses of 50 mcg each (T=0, T=25, T=60, T=90, T=120, T=150)
** Frequent user: 15 to 30 minutes after 525 mcg of fentanyl insufflated via nasal drops, split into six doses of 87.5 mcg each (T=0, T=15, T=30, T=45, T=75, T=90)
* Mood is negative due to anxiety over breathing and other negative physical effects
** Physically feeling a some of: hot/cold flashes, tingling, actual numbness in limbs and extremities, pins and needles, tightness in chest, trouble moving legs/arms, heaviness in legs/arms, nausea, vertigo, dry mouth, thirst, and pretty much anything else on this list at http://www.drugs.com/sfx/fentanyl-side-effects.html
** Emotionally feeling a RUSH and/or a PANIC (could be both... the RUSH is neutral while the PANIC is bad)
** Spiritually feeling of shame, guilt, morbid thoughts, mortality...
* Impossible to have a positive social interaction due to physical effects alone
* Nodding may be less of a problem at this stage because of the RUSH/PANIC effect but if it is, you SHOULD NOT GO TO SLEEP until you reach Stage 2 or lower.
* You are CONSTANTLY thinking about breathing and it is DIFFICULT because your breathing is shallow... it's a chore to breath

**Stage 6 and Beyond: Get to the ER!**

Thankfully I've never gone beyond the previous stage but I did come close a few times.

I think it is somewhat lazy to say ""call 911 if you are worried"" because we all know that calling 911 carries financial, social, and sometimes legal consequences.

If you do seek medical help then you will need to tell them it is a fentanyl OD to help your own cause.

Then they will immediately adminster naloxone via IM every 3 minutes until you are breathing well and responsive.

From this point you will be monitored for withdrawal symptoms, face the music, and leave.

So, here's my personal action plan for when these situations come up:

1. Before I decide what to do, I make sure I have at least two methods of contacting emergency services or a trusted person EXTREMELY PHYSICALLY CLOSE BY (cell phone, GChat phone, IM to friend, etc)
2. Then, I ask myself: Am I having trouble breathing? If no, then have I taken any other drugs? If still no, then don't call, but ride it out until reaching threshold stage. If yes to either,
3. Am I able to breath on my own at a rate of at least one inhale-exhale every five seconds for as long as I want? If yes, then try riding it out until threshold or until I can no longer maintain this rate. If no,
4. Am I struggling to stay awake AND/OR unable to control my breathing? If yes, call 911. If not, request an Uber and go to the closest (real) ER. Clean up your house a bit while you wait for it to arrive. Now it's time for that trusted person. In fact you may want to call them before you request the Uber so they will have time to clean up and dip out. They will have at least 25 minutes to help you clean and probably much more as long as you are coherent enough to avoid having the ER contact your next-of-kin or the authorities.",1428953125.0

I took my last dose of heroin at around 10 pm last night and my first dose of suboxone at around 8 pm the next night so I was able to wait almost 24 hours maybe a little less. My usual habit is about 1-2 bundles of decent ecp via iv. (could be that I just have a big habit but idk i've heard people with bigger habits than that having subs work). 

I started off with 4mg of sub (put one 4mg tab under the tongue etc).  Waited like an hour and a half and didn't feel any better so I took another 4m. Basically repeated that pattern through the night along with smoking weed continuously but despite the fact that I took like probably 24mg of suboxone over the course of a night I was still in real bad withdrawals. Basically still experiencing full on temp issues/bathroom issues/nausea/and those FUCKING restless legs which really is the fucking worst symptom in the world and makes me fail every time.

I just don't know what I'm doing wrong. I really can't go through the withdrawal cold turkey maybe I'm just a pussy but I  just can't do it so I figure I can taper with suboxone but now the suboxone isn't working either so wtf.

two days later.. i still have a horrible headache, look like crap, exhausted.  i have barely slept, and i have to work 12 hours today.

I waited until the line cleared out and it was just me and her. I walked up and smiled and tried to spit words out of my mouth that wouldn't sound weird. ""Do you know what a ""D-boy"" is?"" The look on her face was evident she didn't and she asked "" is that a dog toy or type of fish or something?"" I felt like one of those awkwardly written comedy sketches about old people connecting with young people. At this point I didn't know what else to say so I just blurted out.......""do you know where I can get any pot?"" My choice of words couldn't have been more stale. She smiled and didn't say a word. I followed that awkward statement by putting all my cards on the table. I explained my situation, my age, my need for drugs, my lack of human contact outside of my own straight laced family. She just kept smiling and said ""your not a cop, are you?"" I laughed and said no and asked her the same question and she laughingly said no as well. At that point I guess I expected her to pull like some weed, h, coke, meth and some shrooms out of her pocket and ask what I'm looking for. I mean isn't that how it works? They ask the cop question and the if the answer is no they pull out the product.... **JK**    Anyway she asked my name and pulled out a sticky note and said ""I can take your number and if something comes up I can let you know.""

I have dealt with chronic and severe pain for the majority of my life. I have spastic hemiplegia, which was caused by brain cancer that was discovered when I was eight years old. Ever since, my right wrist, fingers, and elbow have spasms, and are quite frequently locked in one position. Being in the same awkward position combined with the spasms causes extreme pain. It was not until recently (25 years after the surgery to remove the cancer) that I was referred to a pain specialist.

My pain specialist started me out on Tylenol3, which quickly switched to Roxicet, which quickly changed to Dilaudid AND Exalgo, which is extended release Dilaudid. This combination seems to keep my pain under control better than the other two options that were previously presented to me by my pain specialist.

However, there is one negative side effect. I am massively constipated at all times. I get stopped up, and then when I finally do use the bathroom, the stool is so compacted and hard, that it literally stretches my anus out and causes it to bleed. That is no fun at all.

How do I overcome this? Is there some sort of diet change that I could make? I don't want to be reliant on laxatives or stool softeners. I would rather go with a change in diet.

I've never been to jail but I've tried rehab and most of us know how that goes. I learned a lot there but never changed my location, and with no friends left, either I burned the bridges or they died, I hauled ass to college. Because of that I maintained support from my family. But, I can't sleep. I don't have the anxiety I usually do associated with withdrawal, but I can't stop thinking. It's been three days of no sleep now, I'm running in zombie mode. I want to slam that liquid bliss, especially since I just got paid, more than anything. However I suppose it's good that I'm where I'm at, I can't find a damn thing. Not even a Vicodin. 

But to the point, hows your sleep habits? ",1429080527.0

I thought I'd easily be able to search this sub and find something about this, but that wasn't the case, so here goes:

I've noticed my eyes have been extremely, uncomfortably dry recently, and it seems to be linked to my opiate use. I use other drugs, but the irritation always gets most noticeable when I'm on opiates. 

Considering I've been taking opiates for ~5 years, this seems weird. Maybe it's because of the suboxone-- now that I think about it, this problem started roughly around the time I started using suboxone. Does anyone else experience this, with suboxone specifically or opiates in general? Or do you think it's just that time of year? And if you do experience it, what do you do about it? I've tried visine eyedrops but they don't seem to help much, and I thought I read somewhere that eyedrops (or maybe certain types) aren't particularly good for your eyes.

Thanks in advance for any advice / responses!",1429044376.0

Nothing like having 4 buns stuffed inside this fancy little contraption and being able to take bumps on the fly without worrying about a straw or having to tear bags open and making noise (when you're in public).

It's especially nice if you're like me and have to hide it from people. I just go to the bathroom, tap it a couple times, turn the valve, sniff, close the valve, toss it in my pocket, and I'm back to the party without being shady and taking forever or going into a stall to piss.

Just thought I'd share in case anyone else was dealing with the same shit I was.

Trust me, make the investment. It's worth it. They make different sizes so read how much it can hold before you buy one. Mine says it holds 3g's.

Only downside is that you can lose track of how quick you're going through your stash.

I knew it was a planet because the first thing you learn in astronomy is that if it does not sparkle it is not a star.  So beautiful...glowing like a jewel in the cosmos.  Am I looking through a telescope?  Why is Jason here?  He is not in my astronomy class.  He's an art school dropout.

""Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!"", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled.

Jason dragged me down the path.  I left a trail of blood on the ground from my nose.  Dot.  Dot.  Dot.

""What happened?"", I asked.

""Well he took your money if that's what you mean.  I told you to put it in your boot"", said Jason pulling me through the bushes to a sidewalk and then across a street.  

There were people here.  They stared at us.  In the reflection of a Cinzano's Cafe I saw my face.  My nose was puffy looking and blood oozed out.  The guy eating an egg and pickled peppers sandwich inside looked at me with disgust so we kept walking.

""Do you really think that guy was a cop?"", I asked.  My voice sounded funny and thick.

""Lets hope not"", muttered Jason as he lit a cigarette and helped me down the entrance to the BART station.

""Man this sucks!"", said Jason puffing away angrily.

""Yeah"", I agreed, ""but at least we got away.  And maybe my nose isn't broken...""

""Not your nose!  The fucking heroin man!  We got nothing!""

I made a mental note not to share any painkillers with Jason that I might get from the school doctor and got on the escalator.  Jason jogged down the stairs and the wind from the train tunnels lifted his hair and jacket into the air like wings.  I leaned against the railing of the escalator and held my swollen nose. 

Students of my university try really hard to look gritty and urban.  It's the effect of this city.  Like a giant pulsating heart, the city takes in ideas and personalities and pumps them through it's vast historical chambers.  Like a virus, this alters the very DNA of the idea and molds it to fit into the culture of the city.  This place changes you.  But the people who grew up in the city can always spot the students.

Students look a little too healthy.  They glow brighter with nicer teeth and wear expensive mall clothes.  Students also make easy targets because most students have money.

We were on the other side of the park.  Not the side where the students played frisbee or where the mother's pushed their baby strollers.  We were on the side were the unwashed masses of homeless kids clashed with the crazies, the pyschos and the drug addicts.  We passed a restroom where a wall had been transformed into an informational board.  All these pictures of missing kids with heartfelt messages to call home.

""Fuck you hear those stories about how someone is preying on homeless kids in this park?"", asked Jason as we strolled beneath towering redwood trees that swooshed and swayed beneath a clear blue sky.

""Yeah they found a kid tied to a tree with his throat cut last weekend.  Somewhere 'round here..."", I answered looking at pictures of all the missing kids.    

We walked towards the fountain where people congregate.  The smell of ganja and patchouli oil wafted from a crowd of people with shopping carts, sleeping bags and dogs.  They looked like psychedelic gypsies.  

""How are we gonna do this?"", I asked.  I had never walked up to a stranger and asked for heroin.

""Easy"", said Jason.  ""Just need to find a junkie and ask him or her.  Too many hippies here though.  Lets try down there.""

""Ok...""

We walked through the park and found some older homeless guys on a bench.  

""Bingo!"", smiled Jason, ""notice the soda?  Not beer?  This guy likes H.""  Jason strolled up to the men who stared coldly at us.

""You guys know where to score any H?"" asked Jason loudly.

""Man get the fuck out of here!"", yelled the man and he threw his soda at Jason.

""Whoa!  Sorry sir! "", said Jason and then to me, ""Lets get out of here!""

We hurried away but another guy followed us so we stopped.  A middle aged guy drinking a beer.

""I can hook you up.  What are you looking for?"", he said.

""Bundles.  Would love to make a volume deal...how much can you get us?"", smiled Jason.

""I can get 10 maybe 12 right now..."", the guy said carefully, ""but I need the cash first.""

""Nope"", I said feeling very street savvy, ""we need to see it before we pay...""

""Ok"", the guy said fishing out a handful of bundles from inside his jacket, ""Now show me some cash.  These are $65...""

""$65?"", repeated Jason incredulously.

As they argued I watched a guy who looked like he was an office worker out for a stroll.  But he walked too fast and right up to us.  As he walked by he suddenly lunged at the dealer and grabbed his hand knocking bundles everywhere.

""What-!"", yelled the dealer.  The guy held out a hand and pointed at us and held his other hand behind his back near his waistband.

""I am police officer!  All of you freeze!""

So we stood there.  But shock turned to fear as he pulled out a gun and pointed it at us while walking forward.  The dealer took one step back and CRACK! -the guy swung the gun like a club right into the dealer's face.  The blow instantly staggered the dealer who collapsed.  A tooth bounced in front of my boots.

""Empty your pockets boys!"", the guy said as he stooped down and started grabbing bundles.

Then I did a foolish thing.  A very foolish thing that explains why my nose is crooked.  I stood up for myself against a man with a gun.

""Can we see your badge?"", I asked politely.  

He stared at me, uncocked the gun and put it back in the holster very casually.  He glanced around the park and turned towards me with a smile.  I never saw the punch.

Then I was lying on my back staring at Jason's concerned face.  I wondered if he knew what planet that was orbiting above us in the heavens?

""Dude wake up!  C'mon he's chasing the guy!  Let's go!"", urged Jason helping me up.  I looked around and keeled over.  My balance was shot.  Sky, trees, grass and park all rolled past me as my head wobbled.",1429037318.0

For me, she's just not delevoped enough as a character. She is boring, her friends are boring, their conversations are boring. We don't know anything about her, other than wanting a good life for her son and to be on television. As she gets crazier, and her desire to be on TV gets bigger, it's just not something I can relate to in any way. The 3 main characters of the dope-portion of the film are so much more interesting to me. Her fate is tragic, but Jared Leto's fate is so much more heartbreaking.
