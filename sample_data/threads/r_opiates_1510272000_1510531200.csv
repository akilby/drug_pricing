(Documentary link)',"b'[https://youtu.be/F1ojeXgyAu0](https://youtu.be/F1ojeXgyAu0)\n\nI watch a lot of documentaries about opiates, and I came across this one about the crisis in Canada. I have heard about safe injection sites in Canada before, but this was the first I learned of a really unique (and somewhat controversial) government-funded recovery program for long-time addicts. Basically, addicts in this program are provided with free, medical grade heroin. They are given restricted amounts and can use it safely at the clinic in which they receive it. This program reduces government costs, the amount of overdoses (mainly because addicts aren\xe2\x80\x99t consuming heroin cut with fentanyl), as well as thefts and other petty crimes committed by people looking to fund their habits. It actually seems very innovative and successful. The program is only open to long, LONG-term addicts that have tried other means of getting sober. Basically, the idea is that these people are going to use heroin anyway, so instead of them obtaining/using it illegally and dangerously, why not regulate it and have them use it in a safer, more cost-effective way?\n\nThis is the first time I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever heard about this. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a really great idea. This documentary was interesting as a whole, but this specific program is discussed at 35:25.

I've been browsing this sub on & off for a while - when I'm all out or just don't have as much drugs as I'd like to, I tend to torture myself by reading this board and looking at your beautiful stashes, and if I have enough heroin to get me to where I like to be I tend to be busy chain smoking, nodding out and/or smoking crack to go on Reddit, but I've always appreciated this sub - it's a nice counterbalance to /r/opiatesrecovery & seems to be the only sub where heroin isn't demonized, even amongst the other drug subs. \n\nI've been on & off & on & off heroin for four, nearly five years now. I smoked it for a little while but then graduated to I.V. use after a couple of months, and then in the last year I've been alternating between just heroin & mixing it with crack - either I.V. as a speedball or just hitting the pipe. As I'm sure many of you can relate to, I've been tantalized by the prospect of chipping but have failed at keeping my use at that level countless times. \n\nHowever, about four months ago I met a girl who changed my perspective entirely. I met her while she was using - she was taking heroin + crack, though not I.V. - and she told me that she used to be a junkie but now just chipped. Of course, I immediately assumed she was either lying to me or herself or both, as I've heard that many times but invariably they are either on a fast downward spiral on the way to being a full blown junkie, at the start of a relapse or just flat out lying, so I naturally assumed the same of her. \n\nHowever, afterwards I bought it up with a friend who confirmed that he's known her for over a year and she doesn't have a habit. I was still dubious, but have been seeing a lot of her, and in the four months I've known her I've met her many times, but she has only been high on five occasions. I haven't even had a tiny suspicion - it's obvious when she's high, she does it openly, & I've seen & experienced enough withdrawal to know what it looks like. She is a genuine chipper, and has been for *three years*! I was absolutely fascinated, and have spent the last couple of months picking her brain.\n\nShe explained to me the same old story that we all know, of starting out with the usual arrogant assumption that we will be the special one that doesn't get hooked and maintaining this delusion until heroin has kicked our ass, ruined our relationships, drained our bank accounts, lost us our jobs & totally derailed everything we held dear. She explained that she quit entirely for a few months, and then she decided that heroin was very valuable to her - the state of mind that it gives her (as it gives most of us) was so extremely pleasurable that she didn't want to let it go. She was determined to conquer it. She said she spent a few months trying & failing and slipped up many times, but then something clicked for her. She realized a large part of her failure to manage it stemmed from the deeply held yet partially subconscious core belief that each time she used she was destined to become hooked again. She realized that each time she lapsed she surrendered entirely to addiction again, and that she needed to stop lying to herself. She told me how she realized that the human spirit is incredible, & that the things that humans can achieve with determination & willpower are amazing, and that there is no reason why someone shouldn't be able to manage heroin, and no reason why it couldn't be her. \n\nSince that realization, she changed tactics. She internalized the fact that every time she used, for a while afterwards she would literally become mentally ill. Her mind would start lying to her, and she needed to treat herself after using as if she was psychotic, and not indulge in the thoughts that would try and drive her back to using. Since then, she only uses once a month at most, and she has never developed a habit again. \n\nDuring this time period, I weaned myself off subutex, had a relapse on heroin + crack, and then went through the withdrawal and emerged entirely physically sober. I then spent a couple of months entirely sober except for occasional drinking, but have now decided to try my hand at what she has accomplished, but this time trying to apply what she has taught me. So far, it has been successful. It's all in my mind. After using, I literally become mentally ill. For a couple of days afterwards, I know that my mind will start playing tricks on me. There is no use arguing with the thoughts that come, just as there's no use trying to argue with a paranoid schizophrenic. There's no point trying to reason with it or deny that it's happening - merely accept it, see it for the temporary mental illness that it is, and wait to emerge from the other side. Yes, those couple of days are not the most pleasant days I've ever had - it takes willpower, discipline & vigilance to continually reframe what your own plagued mind keeps telling you, but it's getting easier, and it sure beats the fuck out of withdrawals, full-blown addiction & abstinence for the rest of my life. \n\nThe connection between using once and then using every single day needs to be extinguished. The longer you successfully chip, providing you *never* break or change the limit you set yourself, the stronger that connection will get and the easier it is to do. I thought I'd share this in case anyone found anything valuable in it - I realize this will probably not get any attention, but I figured I owed it to put out there what I was given. Hope one of you out there finds something worthwhile here. """,1510340919.0

Not because I want to stay clean but because I can\xe2\x80\x99t find any. I have only one connect and he\xe2\x80\x99s coming up empty every day. I was on a pretty low daily intake of around 20-30mg/day so I\xe2\x80\x99m not feeling any significant physical discomfort from withdrawals but I am taking 3-6 2mg loperamide every 24 hours. \n\nThis run with pills lasted about 9 months before which I had not taken any oxy/hydro for 4 years. I had been addicted to some type of opioid from 1998-2012. Started off with hydros after a rotator cuff injury which led to methadone maintenance from 2000-2008 then suboxone from 2008-2012. Switching from \xe2\x80\x98done to subs was horrific. Getting off the subs was extremely painful physically and mentally so the memories of that experience fueled my abstinence from 2012 to early 2017. \n\nAlcohol became my substitute and I started to drink moderately to heavily during that period but eventually got bored with it so I decided I would try and dance with my old nemesis again. It only took a couple of months of having a relatively steady supply of cash and pills before I realized I was in trouble and in the early throes of physical/psychological dependency. Mornings are my trigger time as I absolutely love my dose first thing in the morning. I can get through the rest of the day rather easily and once that wears off I get busy with work, family responsibilities, etc. Not having that morning fix puts me in a rather melancholy way for the rest of the day.\n\nThis current dry spell probably came at a good time as I was at the precipice of spiraling into full-blown danger mode. I think the writing is on the wall for oxy/hydro aficionados/addicts though as the dry periods get longer and longer, the overall reaction to the \xe2\x80\x9copiate epidemic\xe2\x80\x9d causing street markets here to dry up or be overpriced into the realm of insanity.\n\nI live in the midwestern US near a large city and used to have a pretty wide range of contacts but after years of stability with legal maintenance drugs and then a few years of abstinence I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone anymore. DNMs look promising but also seem like a huge PITA and rife with peril. Kratom is not legal in my state and not very appealing to me though I\xe2\x80\x99ve never tried it. Never going to try H. Briefly considered going back on the \xe2\x80\x98done or subs but then I\xe2\x80\x99d be officially fucked again (driving time, gas money, waiting in line, et al not to mention likely outed to my spouse hence another problem I don\xe2\x80\x99t need and a situation she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve). Thought about shopping for a sympathetic doctor since I have decent insurance but those are roulettes odds these days. Hopefully my connect comes through with something today but if not I\xe2\x80\x99ll be just okay.   \n\ntl;dr - I passionately love oxy/hydro but she is a cruel mistress; I can endure long periods without her but can\xe2\x80\x99t fathom never seeing her beautiful face again.'",1510333295.0

He used to go in there Friday night after they closed and get a bag and just fill it with bottles of oxy (old school ones), Percocets, Vicodins, Everything good you can imagine. \n\n""Among prescription drugs discovered missing from McWilliams Pharmacy at that time were more than 19,000 dosage units of Oxycontin, Oxycodone, methadone and morphine.""\n\nThis went on for about 9 months, He got a shit load of people addicted, and was responsible for 3 peoples deaths... One of those people was his best friend. \n\nHis best friend never did opiates before and he gave him 80mg of methadone plus the kid was drinking (he was only 18). Methadone takes awhile to kick in so this kid went home and ended up ODing and passed away.\n\nThe guy kept robbing his fathers pharmacy. I couldnt figure out how the father who was the pharmacist did not notice the meds missing, I mean wtf? I remember my dad got a rx of ms contin 30s and he filled it at this pharmacy and the asshole gave him 10mgs instead of the 30s. After that I figured the father had to of known something.\n\nBy this time, The guy was doing 1000 mgs of oxy a day and it was not doing anything, I dont know what happen but he started going out of state and getting a lot of dope and coke.\n\nHe was finally arrested ( DEA was involved plus a bunch of other local task forces). His family lost the pharmacy, and his parents got divorced and he got sentenced to 17 years in jail.\n\nIf I was in his shoes I would of kept those opiates to myself and never would of let anyone know I even abused drugs.. fucking idiot\n\nThink all of this is bullshit?\n\nhttp://www.dailyitem.com/news/drug-dealer-will-spend-years-in-jail/article_a15b9693-39ef-525a-9ae2-070f71426849.html\n\n\nAnyways that is where my first Oxy came from, 13 years of using and I lost everything I am now on suboxone for the last year and really getting my life together, Great forum take it easy and be safe guys\n'",1510314512.0

She just cannot accept that I really do love her because of our backrounds. I grew up well my grandpa and father multi millionaires, big house etc. She grew up in trailer park with only her mom working low paying jobs. With that said I don't ever think of these things for a second, I love her for her regardless. \nWhat gets me most is even though I had a good childhood,most people would never guess what I've been through. I've had 4 ODs the last 2 my heart stopped doc said I should be dead. I've had it all then turned around and lost it all. \n2 years ago I had my own house 2 car's, motorcycle and thousands saved up. Yet here I am now I have 20$ cash,15,000 in debt collections, and my most expensive item I own is a 200$. I also would be homeless but I moved in with my girl and her mom's trailer\nANYWAYS the point I'm making is because of my past I'm very humble, you'd never catch me judging anyone. So here I am I finally found what I had been searching for wrongly in dope real happiness that she provides,but what's killing me is simply because of my family she cannot believe I feel this way.\n She seems to think my family or friends think less of her because she grew up poor. This is killing me yall I can't figure out how to make her understand that all that bullshit is irrelevant and besides if anyone I knew would say something like that to me they wouldn't be in my life anymore.

But, I\'m at the point where I\'m just done, so I\'m going to continue tapering and not using dope anymore.\n\nBut anyway:\n\nI have been taking 1mg sub every morning since Sunday. So, Sunday I took 1mg sub and didn\'t use. The next day, I took 1.5mg sub or so in the morning, and I ended up getting some dope later on that day. It was good quality, I felt pretty high, and all was well. The next day, I really didn\'t feel sick even almost at 24 hours. Usually I would feel sick around 18 hours, sometimes less. But, I did not, and I took my sub in the morning after almost 24 hours, because I wanted to continue to taper. I ended up getting another bun, but it was shit quality, so I didn\'t feel anything. Whatever. \n\nThen yesterday, I took about .5 mg sub, but I wasn\'t even feeling sick at all, and I had just about hit 24 hours again. I used again, a bun of good quality dope, felt high, and that was that.\n\nWe come to today, and I was not even feeling a slight hint of withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. I mean... no hints of achiness, no yawning, no watery eyes, no restlessness, no anxiety, not even intense cravings. I actually was in a GREAT mood, when usually I\'m fiending hard as fuck when it\'s been 16-18 hours since I last used. And I took a very small piece of sub yesterday, and the dope I did was good, but if I had just done the dope, I would have been sick after like I said... 18 hours or so. The exact amount of hours is irrelevant I suppose; it\'s just that by a whole day later I KNOW I would be sick.\n\nSo, I didn\'t bother taking any sub today, because I knew I had to stop using dope in order to really commit to being clean. So I did what any good junkie would, and I did my last bundle today. I know everyone has said ""this is my last one"" plenty of times when it wasn\'t, but I finally have made the decision that I really want to stop. It\'s just not worth it anymore; getting high for a few hours, and then all you can think about is copping again tomorrow and how you\'re going to get the money for it. The high isn\'t fun anymore and I\'m sick of hurting the people I love by using. It\'s just fucked. I want to save my relationship because my girl is basically on her last nerve with me, because I keep using. I can\'t do it anymore.\n\nAnyway, emotional nonsense aside, I am wondering if using the dope after taking the sub and in between my doses has affected my sub taper at all. I am planning on taking 1 mg each morning for the next few days, and then .5 mg, and then just jumping off. \n\nJudging by how long I\'ve been able to go before I felt sick, I feel like the sub stayed in my system, and I was able to ""cheat"" this system and get high, while still reaping the benefits of the long-lasting sub.\n\nSo, did I really set myself back with using the dope at all? Or did the sub remain in my system, and its just like I\'ve been tapering and was lucky to get high? I really don\'t need a lot of sub to stay well. At this point, all I need is .5-1mg... I feel the hardest part with sub is the first day of induction, switching from dope to subs. Hitting the sweet spot is tough. But I always try and use a low amount so as to make the taper easy as possible.\n\nHope this wasn\'t too convoluted.\n\nI really want to do this, guys. I\'ve spent way too much time wasted on dope. It just isn\'t worth it anymore. I hope all of you can recover too once you\'re ready. Thanks for everything.'",1510279594.0

I suffer from chronic backpain and I haven\'t used opiates in a while because of the bad reaction I had with them(panic attack). \n\n\nI had a panic attack from Hydrocodone and Oxycodone. I had used both of them a handful of times before the incident with the panic attacks occurred.\n\n\n\n The most recent time was with 15mg of Vicodin in the 7.5 variety. I had a buddy who told me he had them and offered them to me for pain relief. I took both and was opiate naive tolerance wise when I took it. I took it while smoking some cannabis to ease the nausea and I took it on a somewhat empty stomach so I expected the APAP to tear my shit up. It does my stomach is not happy I didn\'t give it a slice of bread before the apap but it passes and I go into euphoria. This is nice I throw on some music and start doing stretches(when my back doesn\'t hurt I do posture exercises and lay flat on it and get stuff done) 30 minutes into enjoying a reprieve from my pain the panic comes on. Full on anxiety freaking out. Not new to me I have a Xanax script for this type of thing and I have 0 qualms taking Xanax with opiates(high tolerance). It helps but I can\'t help but be scared to take pain medicine again? I kind of feel stuck(elaborate later on).\n\nheroin chronic pain & crazy\n\nSo I have chronic backpain that I have no idea why its happening. I never did anything to my back that I can recall(I have had a few attempts at suicide while on large amounts of Xanax). So Anyways today I had been planning to hang myself because I had gotten tired of dealing with the pain, figured that I cannot take opiates and the Drs have yet to find the cause of my pain(3 MRIs so far many appointments many phonecalls pleading with the insurance company to let me get said MRIs). I suspect I may have pinched a nerve or something but I don\'t know. This lack of solution leads me back to my logical conclusion: It\'s broken! I am broken I don\'t know whats broken. Apparently I have OCD I don\'t do a lot of that TV shit like hands washing but I get stuck and cannot get out of ideas or thoughts. I am stuck in a loop where I either do hard opiates like Heroin or take my own life as I see those as the only two ""logical"" ways to ""fix"" the situation. Normally I would consult a family member when feeling like this but they have not done Heroin so they cannot speak logically to why this is a bad idea. Logically speaking if its a nerve pain which it maybe wouldn\'t heroin be of little to no use because its a nerve not a broken bone? \n\ni feel like im gonna die from a benzo+opiate overdose at the rate im running\n\n\n\nUpdate/Edit:\nthanks for the replies, seriously I come here a lot and read and the harm reduction you guys do is good shit. Decided against the H. Going to see if I can get a Balcofen script or something before trying more opiates, and if I do try more opiates I\'ll work up slower because I am not trying to get high and if I have no tolerance 5mg of hydro or oxy should be adequate for pain relief. \n'",1510279149.0

So J, R and myself set out on a trip to the city at around 11 o clock last night. We pick up from the regular dboy at the 7/11. We get beans/buttons here in the Midwest and just like everywhere else it seems to be fent is becoming the standard when it comes to the dope game here.\n\nDboy immediately says \xe2\x80\x9cbe careful with these homie, they fire af and custies say they\xe2\x80\x99re the best in the city right now\xe2\x80\x9d we hear his shit all the time so who knows but of course everyone\xe2\x80\x99s like oh hell yeah some fuego finally, been dealing with shitty product lately. Lol\n\nJ is the DD to get home so he just sniffs half of one to get well and we head home. Me and R both bust one up each sniff those are nodding uncontrollably shortly after. We\xe2\x80\x99re both fine though. We get back to Rs place and J immediately goes to the bathroom. He bangs the shit and neither R nor myself fucks with needles. We\xe2\x80\x99re bumping some tunes just talking and bullshitting and here a thud from the bathroom.. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can see we\xe2\x80\x99re this going.. we go investigate to find J, pants around his ankles unconscious on the floor. Immediately R starts freaking out assuming worst case scenario that he\xe2\x80\x99s now got a dead body in his apartment and not just that but this is one of our boys from way back. I propped J up and start trying to talk to him and see if he\xe2\x80\x99ll come back to us. I get a wet was cloth and put it over his head/neck trying to do anything to get him to come too. I put my hand over his neck to feeling for a pulse and he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing now! It\xe2\x80\x99s slow and loud almost like snoring but breathing nonetheless. His breaths are slow and intermittent which alarms me but at least I know he\xe2\x80\x99s breathing. It was at this point I had no fucking clue what to do next? I was just lost. Do I just sit here and watch dude for the next couple hours and make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s good, he\xe2\x80\x99s still unconscious but alive and breathing. R decides that J needs to go home now. We have to carry 200lbs of dead weight down a flight of stairs and put him into Rs car. We take him back to his house and explain to his ol lady what happened and she\xe2\x80\x99s immediately pissed but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to lie about anything just in case considering the situation and someone\xe2\x80\x99s life potentially being on the line. I end up staying over at Js just to make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s okay. He woke up this morning with no recollection of the previous evening events other than him driving us back to Rs and banging 2! of the damn beans even after seeing how fucked up we were after snorting just one. I\xe2\x80\x99m still annoyed with J but glad he\xe2\x80\x99s alive. It was a very stressful evening to say the least. \n\nSo I was wondering if you guys could help me out with tips on how to better handle a situation like that if it happens again, and with all the fent bullshit around I assume it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last time something like that happens. Also, no one had any Narcan and I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where I could get some even if I had the extra funds to do so. Thanks for reading guys.

Its pretty long but I'm not going to include a TLDR because I feel the need to emphasise the importance of looking at the bigger picture in life rather than being stuck in the same thought process every day. For me, thinking like this has had a brilliant effect on my recovery.\n\nIn my recovery I have always found it difficult to find something to fill the time I used to use to get high. Since starting my Subutex program I have managed to find something I'm interested in (astronomy) and it has made me think about the bigger picture in life.\n\nI'd just like to give an example of the power big picture thinking:\n\nEvery morning I walk along the same street on my way to work. I go to cross the road and look both ways before crossing the zebra crossing. As I look right I am always semi-blinded by sunlight (if the Sun's out) reflecting off of a window on a house somewhere up the road but this morning I had a sudden thought...\n\nLight is made up of billions of photons, little tiny packets of energy that were created in the core of the Sun when two Hydrogen atoms fused together through EXTREME pressure to form a Helium atom. Those little packets of energy flew out then bounced around the inside of the Sun for tens of millions of years before they finally got flung out at 186000mph; transversing roughly 93 million miles to the Earth in about 8mins 20sec.\n\nThey then hit the atmosphere, got scattred downward towards the ground where they bounced off of that window and into these two fluid-filled sacs in my face that evolved photo-receptors billions\nof years ago.\n\nThe only reason I was in that possition was because chemical-electrical triggers caused my brain and muscles to co-ordinate themselves into forward directional motion, leading to other muscles to move in the direction of that light - also evolved over millions of years. Those billions of photons then entered my eye and were absorbed by the same photo-receptors and turned into processable information by my brain thus - using chemical-mechanical triggers - causing me to feel pain and temporary vision imparement.\n\nMy point is that these amazing processes are totally un-thought of during every day life, the point is to occaisionally think about these things. Bigger picture thinking makes life a whole lot more interesting!""",1510493332.0

This plug always swore up and down that his was the purest and was raw h, and we all believed him because somehow this stuff was magic, I\xef\xb8\x8f could do a small amount once a day and be high for a long long time, sometimes not even sick for the better part of 48 hours if I\xef\xb8\x8f didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any so I\xef\xb8\x8ft had legs for days.   So we get to talking for a little bit he said he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything but he can get me a sub.   But he was telling me thst when he went to the rehab center they took tox screens and what not and that the only thing that came up was fent.    He was telling me that before he went to rehab no other dope would work for him besides the one plug.   No matter how much he would do.   Now I\xef\xb8\x8f was sitting here thinking to myself, fuck I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to fent and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know It.   Stuff kinda starts to make more sense,  I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed a gram the other morning before I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed the raw, and seriously did the whole thing and was still sick, called the dboy up and accused him of selling me fake shit, but he said no one has complained about it but you so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do shit about it besides make my next bag stronger.  I\xef\xb8\x8f knew he was adding fent to his stuff as he was honest about it.  His stuff usually had a decent rush to it, you would have to do a lot to nod out, and from the way he was adding it in, was actually safe.   He used volumetric measuring and what not, had a machine that would disperse the powder evenly throughout the mix.  He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fucking around.   So I\xef\xb8\x8f grabbed a half from him this morning, he was kinda mad at me for yelling at him and accusing me of him selling me some fake dope, but he handed me the bag and said \xe2\x80\x9cyou gotta chill man, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sell a bag like this to nobody but you, but I\xef\xb8\x8f don\xe2\x80\x99t sell fake shit and can\xe2\x80\x99t be having a customer talking bad about my product\xe2\x80\x9d so I\xef\xb8\x8f knew all he did was add some more fent to it.   I\xef\xb8\x8f got Home and did a shot, and finally got myself well.   But too bad this stuff doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any legs, as it\xe2\x80\x99s now midnight, I\xe2\x80\x99m already sick again. \n\nSo now I\xe2\x80\x99m sitting here fucked.   Dopesick.  Know I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to fent. Pissed about it cuz there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I\xef\xb8\x8f can do. Can\xe2\x80\x99t get high on anyone\xe2\x80\x99s dope but the two plugs I\xef\xb8\x8f use. Not even if I\xef\xb8\x8f put a half in the rig.  I officially don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get high, I\xe2\x80\x99m just so disappointed in myself.   And now I\xef\xb8\x8f know it\xe2\x80\x99s fent, I\xef\xb8\x8f feel even more like a scumbag. Everything seriously happened soooo fast The last 4 months got out of hand, and the last month has been iv use, which got wayyyyyy more out of hand than I\xef\xb8\x8f expected. \n\n Here is a back story of my recent use. I\xef\xb8\x8f relapsed because I\xef\xb8\x8f hurt my shoulder at the gym and bought a few perc 10s thinking that my 4 years off dope would be ok if I\xef\xb8\x8f was Using these really just for pain.  I\xef\xb8\x8f did use them just for the pain but definitely could feel thst opiate relief and that amazing blanket feeling. So it took me about a month after that to finally ask someone, I\xef\xb8\x8f asked if he had any percs and he said nah, not strong enough for me, I\xef\xb8\x8f usually smoke this fent and showed me this pink powder.   I\xef\xb8\x8f instantly decline not know anything about it besides it was killing all my friends. At first I\xef\xb8\x8f was really skeptical but I was  always over at this dudes house because we would goto the gym together when we got out of work.   And I would see him smoke boat after boat and be ok not dead or anything and not too stupid where he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t function. So eventually I\xef\xb8\x8f was like fuck it man, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take one hit.    First time smoking anything off of foil and I\xef\xb8\x8f barely got a hit, but holy jesus did I feel amazing. So after that it was off the races, we would lift then go home and get high.   I\xef\xb8\x8f would never bring anything home with me or anything for a few weeks, just toss him some money for a few hits. Then eventually I was bringing Home 20 bags, and it started getting worse and worse, it was crazy because we could get so much of it for cheap.   I\xef\xb8\x8f eventually got to the point where I was getting sick, and stopped instantly and was actually doing good for a month,   But it brought back all the memories of when I\xef\xb8\x8f was shooting dope, and I\xef\xb8\x8f finally got a connection on some real heroin. \n\n\nAfter about a month or so off of the fent powder I knew what I\xef\xb8\x8f wanted,  I\xef\xb8\x8f really just wanted to expierence the iv rush of heroin one more time.  But I\xef\xb8\x8f couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bring myself to use a needle again.   So I\xef\xb8\x8f started buying some of this h, and would snort maybe a line a day.   A half gram would last me a week and I\xef\xb8\x8f could stay consistently high. This went on for a couple months with the habit getting slowly but surely worse.   I was soon snorting a g a day, but it was good dope so it had legs and I\xef\xb8\x8f never expierenced a sickness just kinda was down when I ran out.  So I\xef\xb8\x8f figured iv use would cut that at least in half, and I\xef\xb8\x8f was right for like the first week I\xef\xb8\x8f was probably only doing a point or two a day and I was ok.  But that\xe2\x80\x99s when I\xef\xb8\x8f really started to get sick, I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up sick and have to do a shot before I even took a shit. Then it got to a half a week later, and the last week or two at least a gram a day maybe 1.5-2 if it\xe2\x80\x99s from dude with the mediocre dope.  I\xef\xb8\x8f was clean for 4 years before all of this so I\xef\xb8\x8f know what I\xef\xb8\x8f have to do.  I\xef\xb8\x8f just have to cut all ties.   All my friends, when I was in the programs so they were real friends, all seemed to have relapsed too.   So I\xe2\x80\x99m just sitting here thinking fuck I\xef\xb8\x8f have to make a whole new support group and start all over again.     My life is actually going decently right now, getting back to work after a couples months of being off.   Work is great my Job is great.  I\xef\xb8\x8f maintain, I\xef\xb8\x8f can work through withdrawal if I have too.  But I have the next 3 days off and I\xef\xb8\x8f figure I can get over the hump of the w/d and take a small piece of sub for Work And do the Robert taper plan.   \n\n\nI\xef\xb8\x8f kinda just went on a rant there, I\xef\xb8\x8f apologize.  I\xef\xb8\x8f banged some ice to get through some of the w/d tonight,  don\xe2\x80\x99t know why But this works for me, I\xef\xb8\x8f hate the stuff but it makes me feel ok while I\xe2\x80\x99m high and I\xef\xb8\x8f can actually function.    I think I\xef\xb8\x8f just end up keeping myself so busy that I\xef\xb8\x8f dont have time to think about being dope sick \n\nI\xef\xb8\x8f have no problem saying no to any drug when I\xe2\x80\x99m sober.   I\xef\xb8\x8f just usually smoke weed, don\xe2\x80\x99t drink, hate stimulants, kinda just lived the hippy life going from festival to festival.  And in those places everything you could want is around.   You can find it all out in the campgrounds, but I\xef\xb8\x8f never would search for anything or buy it when the dealers came around.   I\xef\xb8\x8f would occasionally take a dose or two and enjoy a day of music, but in my opinion i wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything hard, just things I\xef\xb8\x8f believed were enhancing my life.    But the thing is now, when I\xe2\x80\x99m on dope, I\xef\xb8\x8f can\xe2\x80\x99t say no to basically anything.   It\xe2\x80\x99s turned into such almost a needle addiction. I\xef\xb8\x8f Love the act of preparing and shooting up.   I\xef\xb8\x8ff I\xef\xb8\x8f don\xe2\x80\x99t have dope, idc I\xe2\x80\x99ll shoot a small shot of ice or maybe some powder just to take away from the anxiety of wanting to use a needle.   I\xef\xb8\x8f really think this relapse has beat me up a lot worse than I\xef\xb8\x8f expected.  \n\nBut anyways, here\xe2\x80\x99s my formal introduction to this community.    I love reading your stories and drooling over your pictures.    I\xef\xb8\x8f hope I\xef\xb8\x8f can get my life back on track and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you all posted.  And as for the confused part of the title in my post,  how the hell did my dealer(the guy that was out for a few days) get such a long lasting relief from dopesickness, if it was all fent?'",1510464708.0

I know I am probably freaking out over nothing and it may not even form an abcess but I want to be ready just in case.

I had totally forgotten about taking the xanax last night. I have a slight tolerance to oxy and I've been taking around 10-20mg a day for a few weeks. \n\nDo I have anything to worry about or is my anxiety just making me paranoid?

My closest friend is addicted to meth, and has been for a few years. He's like my brother. I don't get to see him much, for multiple reasons; the current reason being that he's been trying to hide the extent of his drug use. He stopped for a few days a couple month back for me to come see him. He was trying to put on the illusion that he's getting clean. \n\nSkipping a bunch of details as not to type for hours, this is what its come to: he called a few days ago asking if he could stay with my wife and I for 3 weeks. This is something neither me or my wife are comfortable with. He has lied to us. He has been accused by his blood relation of theft (which i would not put past him...some things we lent him disappeared).\n\nHe refuses to take any responsibility for his drug use, and blames everything around him from stress to the city he stays in. He has it in his mind that he'll be able to get into a rehab facility at no cost.\n\nOn one hand, i want to help him. Like I said, he's like a brother to me. I don't have any blood family. We've been through a lot together.\n\nOn the other hand though, I know i can't trust him right now. I can't afford to feed another person. I know that within hours he'd walk the neighborhood and find a spot to cop some meth. There's drugs everywhere in my area. If he were actually trying to get clean, I'd feel terrible for having other drugs in the house, and for being high around him.\n\nI have not yet told him the answer is no; i will be doing that tomorrow. But, I feel like I'm making the wrong decision either way. It's fucking me my head pretty bad.\n\n(Sorry for the long post; thank you to anyone that reads)""",1510416880.0
