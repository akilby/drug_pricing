He got pulled over and searched (ran a red light) everything in the car was clean but they found a plunger (not the need or cap or anything) and several cotton balls in his car. There was nothing visibly dirty about the plunger, i mean it didn't have visible residue on it or anything like that. The cotton balls he told me were brown (only like 4 of them). 

They didn't charge him with possession which i guess they could for the cotton?? Also the plunger isn't really paraphernalia without the rest of the needle. Anyone heard of this before? Seems vindictive but i mean i guess he can get in trouble for the cotton if it has residue in it which it probably does. My understanding is that you cant have a paraphernalia  charge of an object that you can legally have unless there is or are drugs in the vicinity creating reasonable suspicion/probable cause that the object was intended to be utilized for the consumption of the drugs. Either way it seems so little that it is insane that the cops would ruin someones future over such a minor thing. 

Anyone have this happen to them? also lets not debate whether he can argue that you cant do anything with just the plunger because you need the cotton bc I'm pretty sure the law just means you have an object that is part of the paraphernalia. For example you can be charged with drug paraphernalia of a meth pipe even if it is broken and smashed and you cant actually use it anymore. Same here, alone the plunger you cant do anything with but it is apart of a syringe so i don't believe that would be a valid defense and the cottons can be the basis for the possession of drugs as you can shoot cottons as we all know.",1501551670.0

What do you guys suggest for a curious try?

Also how dangerous is speedballing really? I guess I should try the heroin first and then start mixing up with coke.

Barely had any withdrawals at all. I'm both shocked and proud of myself!,"So I'm from a big city in the Northeast, where dope is always readily available. I have been using very,very heavily over the past 14 months. 

Ive done suboxone rapid-tapers before in rehab, but that was years ago. Recently, I find it almost impossible to use suboxone because my withdrawals suddenly feature really bad vomiting (about once an hour) which never used to be a problem for me. Every time I take suboxone now, I automatically throw up from the taste and waste the sub. I just flew to the Northwest, and will be in bumblefuck WA for the next 10 days. Since I have no connects out here, I decided to stock up on dope and try to taper down....for real this time.

My powder lasted about 4 days, after which I had to drive to a big city and cold cop. It was surprisingly easy to get my hands on $70
of Black Tar.  That 70$ lasted for about 4-5 days, as I slowly chipped away at the little bit of tar that I had. After significantly reducing my doses and the frequency of the doses, I did the last little bit about 2 days ago. So I'm over 48 hours without anything, and withdrawals have been almost nonexistent! Today I'm halfway through day 3 and I feel awesome. I never thought I would ever have the power to successfully taper down and detox using just dope and weed, but it's been done! After my last shot, I've been waiting for the symptoms to start, but other than a little bit of restlessness on the first night (a Xanax and a hit of weed took care of that), I haven't had any symptoms at all! 
I've tried to do this so many times before, but always end up binging on what I have and not properly sticking to a taper regimen. I think the change of environment was the major factor in my success this time. 

Anyway, for anyone who has tried or is about to try to taper down, I just want to let you know it's totally possible to taper down quickly and painlessly without having to substitute another opiate.

Now the real question is: can I stay clean this time? Honestly, if it hadn't been for the success of this taper I wouldn't have much hope of staying clean but this whole experience has really opened my eyes as to what I'm capable of!

A horse can run as soon as it is born, our brains however are so advanced it must grow mostly after birth to avoid killing our mother.

There is so much development going on in those first few years, any adversity like the aforementioned will actually cause degradation on a physical level. Either through damaging cortisol, or lack of natural dopamine, benzodiazepine, endorphin etc receptors. It has been proven that even a stressed mother leaks cortisol into the amniotic fluid and can thus shrink the corpus collasum, the center responsible for impulse control.

This is what society doesnt want to think about- the fact that our addiction is largely a result of things that were far out of our hands. We are the scapegoats of society because when people look into us, they see a mirror that reflects their own pursuit of chemical freedom and they dont like to feel that, they believe theyre just above chemicals.

I just dont want anyone being crazy harsh on themselves. I was sexually abused and as a male, i feel it makes the shame even more apparent. Its hard to remember the kind of negativeeffects this had on my psyche, much less in a physical aspect. Im high and read much of this in a book my doctor lent me.

After 8 years enough was enough. I had started subs around March 30th and on July 24 I suddenly dropped to one 8mg sub after almost 3 months of 16mg a day and after that on July 28 had decided I don't want them anymore. I don't need them I feel. So I've not had a sub since Friday and honestly feel fine.

I do have the yawns, light insomnia and a runny nose but that is all. I feel good physically. 

Mentally I don't know how to feel. Now I just sort of feel like now what?

I do know that withdrawal is real. But after this is I do feel a large part is mental outlook. My friend was on subs dropped down to an 8th of a sub after much weaning he still said he felt like he was dying. I don't know why it's been so different for me. There was a time I would dread going four hours between doses and now I've gone 3 days.

Sub Prob prevented OD. Plz don't ask where to get them!

I know there's a TON of fent around here but these ones deserve a real warning. They are really really strong. Definitely life taking strong in small doses. 

One thing I have to point out that was odd was they were all still high the next day (24 hrs) eyes constricted/pinned and everything even after narcan (I know it only works effectively for a short period against strong stuff). They didn't even feel w/d or need to use. Though that was strange. Happened to me before years ago on a stamp called unlimited. Was high for over a day. 


Edit: just to show how serious overdoses are here (they say they were heroin but I'm willing to bet most were fent/analogue related). 1 hospital 51 people in 48 hrs just 3-4 days ago.

But some shit I didn't know when I was using is that suicidal thoughts can be pretty common for heroin addicts. Not just when you're detoxing, or for the recovery period afterwards, but all the time.

I had a few friends cross the finish line in active addiction, and I sure didn't mind the idea at times. Those dark shots you know aren't safe.. That final escape plan if shit goes down. Just the overwhelming task of existing with all the baggage that comes with addiction. Honestly, it makes the idea pretty attractive at times.

When and if you get clean, or get straight on maintenance, or whatever, all that shit will slowly fade away. You will see there's a lot of love for you out there, even it it doesn't seem like it. 

I just hope more people are aware of how powerful depression and drug addiction are together, and how easily they coexist. 

Please don't neglect your mental health. There's a lot of different services out there if you need a little lift or perspective. I know it's overwhelming living the life, and after enough time the life can feel pointless. Please trust me when I say it's not over yet. You don't have to get clean today, or this year, or ever. But please know a lot of shit changes in life when you start making progress with addiction and the related issues. I've seen too many ODs shrugged off. I've done it myself. I've felt so lost and trapped death sounded pleasant.

But addiction is something most of is go through in our own time and way. There's an end to the stress and turmoil if you live to see it. And life won't be puppies and roses ever, but there is still love and beauty and companionship waiting. Please don't take your share from the world too soon. It's something we all share, and all need.

My last dose of H was April and so was the fent.

I was on suboxone  for a couple months too, but I moved back in with my parents to get my life back on track, away from the opiates and to save some money.. unfortunately I jumped off hastily at 4mg subs and still been using pills almost every day to cope (or any opportunity I can get them) 

Lately I've gotten a steady source of Oxynorm 20mg (Instant release OXY), Generic Oxycontin 20mg (Modified release but they are crushable? Pretty much instant release) and those horrible, horrible Oxy OPs in the 30s.

It's not uncommon for me to have 120mg of the shitty OP's at once, even all chopped up, cos I feel hardly anything, but when I get the 'good ones', I'm using 60-100mg of instant release in one dose (very very expensive and I hate myself for it)

Anyways when I cant get on I go the pharmacy and buy a box of 30 x 12.8mg codeine (Australia) , and for some reason I can swallow 10 - 15 of them and I actually get a buzz and it knocks 3/4 of my withdrawls away?

I'm really confused as to why it's still working for me, obviously I'm not complaining but am very confused? How does such a weak opiate still work, and correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't it use the same enzyme that Oxy uses to convert Oxycodone to Oxymorphone like Codeine to morphine ?

So I was in actual pain the other night (toothache) and you know how you take for granted all the recreational oxy you've had when you ACTUALLY could benefit from it? Yeah that was me. So I presented to the ER and the doc gave me a dental block, numbed my face up good. Couldn't feel a thing. 

Anyway he was clearly off his feet and was running around like an idiot looking after a hundred people at once. He came back and said ""here's a few Endone tablets to take home (5mg IR oxy) and here's a script so you can get some more tomorrow to tie you over.""

All well and good, the oxy helped after the dental block wore off to ease the pain. (funny using oxy for therapeutic benefit right)

So at like 10am I go to the chemist and hand over the hospital script, the pharmacist looks at it funny and tells me he needs to ring the hospital to verify it. First time for everything I suppose. 

He hangs up, and starts his process. Then he does the ""script for xxxxx"" callout, and he says 'your repeats are in with the receipt'.

Repeats? What? 

I get in the car and open up to find my box of 20 Endone tablets, and the repeat authorization.

Again, again, and......AGAIN!!!","My worst nightmare, the harsh reality which is my life. I never thought I would become a junkie. Sure, I was somewhat of a junkie when I smoked tar on my days off from work or sniffed a bag of china with a few buddies at a party. Heroin used to be so much fun. Then, one day it turned on me. Or I turned on it I should say. I fucked up about 3 years ago and let my dealer/friend shoot me up for the first time. A few days later I shot up by myself for the first time. I believe that's when my life drastically started to fall apart.

In the past year I have binged, detoxed, stayed clean for a couple of weeks, and then binged again probably upwards of 20-30 times. It's the cycle. If you shoot dope you know the cycle I am refering to. I am not trying to downplay pill poppers or people who don't bang heroin but I truly believe you have not reached your bottom, the absolute lowest point in your opiate addiction until you start shooting up on a daily basis. And for those who will give examples of pill users or non IV heroin users who have been clean for many years, and state that their bottoms were not IV use. Well, who's to say they wont fall right back into the trap and eventually satrt banging their DOC? All Im saying is you have not seen the worst that this life has to offer until you have fallen madly in love with the needle. We can't predict the future, therefor you cannot say that you will never shoot up. Anyone who has ever graduated to IV use never pictured their life turning out the way it did. 

Anyway, the past 3 months have been a constant cycle of binging on powder heroin (likely fentanyl ) for 3-14 days, followed by quitting cold turkey for 7-14 days. My last bender lasted almost a week and the detox was pretty rough. I was 10 days clean up until about 2 hours ago.  I fucking relapsed again and bought a $20 of some bullshit fentanyl trash. It was garbage ass dope. I'm honestly kinda glad it was. I feel like shit right now and am not even high anymore. I honestly hope I don't pick up tomorrow and start the cycle all over again. I'm hoping I don't feel too hungover tomorrow given the dope was so shitty. But if I wake up feeling like complete ass, I might try to find some better shit around town. I honestly fucking hope I don't and just tough out the cravings tomorrow. 

I'm so fucking tired of shooting dope. I cant even go back to snorting 30's or smoking tar. All i ever want to do is bang heroin. I have completely ruined my love for opiates when i stared shooting up. I have turnd into a complete waste of space piece of shit junkie.  The needle is a best friend who i can't  seem to let go. Everytime i think im doing good i turn around and fuck it up again. I hope tonight was a one and done, because i honestly can't keep doing this to myself. I'm fucking dying more and more everyday I have a needle in my arm. Thanks for reading, hope you can realte. Well, I guess I hope you can't relate or never do. Take care and be safe everybody.

I broke my collarbone Friday and have been in the hospital since, got surgery on Monday. All went well. I tried to avoid it as much as possible but after being unable to sustain the pain the first night after surgery, I took a couple oxycodone pills, 6 hours apart. Took another one the next day (yesterday) around 5 pm, and that's it. Many of my friends had similar experiences and took way more, so I thought it would be okay.

However I find myself being completely unable to sleep now. Every time I'm literally about to fall asleep, something in my head/neck triggers and it just violently shakes one time, waking me up instantly. It's been happening the whole night.

At first, it took two, three, maybe even four hours before I can properly register without missing. And I only had a 10 pack of 31G 5/16"", so needless to say those got used 10-20+ times each and I cringe. Since then I got a 100 pack so truly only use one per IV, if I miss I may give it another go at it, but when [this is what the needle looks like after multiple uses](https://i.imgur.com/xK5g6.png) But now I have another problem, I still miss (or begin to miss) and take another shot at it. This happens over 90% of the time I attempt IV. And I can never, never get blood to get into the syringe to show I have registered, except maybe a few times. At this point I know where my veins are approximately and I just push the plunger and if it doesn't sting keep going, if it does sting, pull the needle back or push it forward and start to plunge it again (and repeat). Also, I have carpal tunnel I'm getting looked st today by an orthopedic specialist, but it's in my dominant/right hand which makes switching up veins to the left arm much more difficult because I can't pull back on the plunger, I can only guess where the vein is and try not missing. Watching YouTube videos on IV tutorials taught me that it's best to feel a vein rather than see one and I completely agree. Once you know what your vein feels like it's very easy to just graze over your forearms or elbow crooks and locate that van you can't see at the surface.

     This is clearly a problem, I don't understand why I can't register even when I am in a vein. Yes, I do pull back on the plunger so the vacuum bubble would fill up with blood when inside the vein. But all of these problems lead me to missing at least some of basically every single shot. I think that's why my injection spots are tender and lumpy. But I've been taking amoxicillin just in case, and just got some cephalexin so I won't have to go to the hospital if I think an abscess may be growing.

""Well, no I can't really say that I do. Sounds nice though.""

He said little else, but the way in which he smiled and looked down at the ground said 'just you wait.' Were we soon to meet? I didn't dare ask but it had to be. He had met him when he had gone where I was about to see.

With that he left and told me that he'd see me when I came out. It was time. I had been told that I should expect to hear a loud buzz, like from a giant bee, and that it would grow louder and that's when it would begin and that it would feel like I was in honey if I tried to swim. Sure enough the buzz came like the moment after the jump, and then there was only the fall, the river and the fear. A potent energy traveled up my body, inches at a time but in the span of a moment, and as the buzzing had gone it had begun. 

And as it goes with a river I didn't swim but got pulled and taken. I got pulled as high or as low as anyone could ever care to go, and there wasn't really anything any higher above or further down below. 

At the high there was a innocuously colored rock. It was round, surrounded by total black, and it looked and glowed like our moon. I didn't know where it was but I knew where I stood. To let him know that I was and to know that he was too - I left him a stone of a similar tone.

""Just leave one for me, okay? Leave one right next to mine and I'll know.""

And at the low, there was an underground cavern with walls that were a deep clay red and I was taken as it were along a stream, and it meandered through and ran with thousands of screaming souls rolling past each other like toothless gears. I recognized the faces I took a second to make and they were from people I had forgotten exist or no longer thought about very much at all, just like the ones that come in a dream. There were kids, old friends, hell-raisers and all, and I rolled along past and among them inside the jagged blood wine colored walls. 

A lot happened in between the highs and the lows. I got pulled for too long and too hard and every minute became a chore. And before everything went black I revisited his throne and saw that nothing had been placed - just a pace from my own, safely colored stone. 

I came to and it felt like the world had spent the afternoon playing soccer with my soul, and there was a word that rested on my tongue that I hadn't previously known. Vermure. Vermill, verma. vermin, vermull. It danced on my tongue for days and then many more before I understood what it was.

Vermilion. The rocks without any glow. The color from the river, of the walls from down below. 

So then friends - I'll see you when we roll.

-

I am currently on methadone, 110mg daily for 2 years.

-

I am getting off of methadone and going to go back to Kratom, which I previously took daily for 3 years or so

-

I know that to minimize suffering, the doctors and my counselor suggest max of coming down 2mg/week. I've seen and heard experiences of people reducing at 3mg/week, and their experiences are normally considerably worse

-

However, spending an equal time tapering to get off as I have on a stable dose sounds and feels ridiculous. For this reason I am looking to ""cheat""

-

I know that ultra low doss naltrexone can be used by those in active addiction to lower & slow the creation of tolerance. I know it would be dangerous to use this while on a stable dose of methadone, or even dangerous on a very long drawn out taper. Yes I know to be careful and SLOWLY introduce intake of naltrexone, starting out much below an amount that would have ANY effect on the process.

**TL;DR- looking to come off methadone at the semi-fast rate of 3mg/week (from 110mg, started 2 years ago) and want to use ultra low dose naltrexone to make it less painful.

Hopefully they'll see I've passed all my drug tests and haven't gotten into trouble and just leave me alone.

Anyone have experience with this? Is it common to have your PO actually come in your house and look around on supervised probation? My old one just knocked on my door and said ""just wanted to make sure you live here"" and then left.

They asked for my phone number and address, which they should already have. Give me this feeling that they're going to stop by soon. I gotta go clean up.

But.. preferably it's related to slamming opioids. I dont even like meth. Somehow I did it around 50 times tho  It was just around many times.

What's the worst infection you ever got?
Pot heads complain about cotton mouth. Tell me about the time you got cotton fever. Etc.

I was always very clean when shooting. I've had needles get thick with blood and had to thin it out and use a new neeedle. But the injection site was always clean. If I had no swabs I'd use soap and clean very well.

But I fell asleep with a rig in my arm once. Woke up to blood in the rig beside me, lots of blood like I shot half abd pulled way back...I did dumb shit like that. I loved watching it go in. 

So I wake up to a rig beside me and I felt off from the monent I woke up. I tried to walk to the bsthroom and my left leg was ..dead. I had no movement ir strength except my upper thigh. 

I walked on my ankle. 

When I got to the bathroom mirror I was living a nightmare.

My lip and left side of my face was swollen. I looked like I had gotten a severe beating but without the bruises and colouring. I was so puffy. I could barely speak cause my tongue was swollen but I called the nurse line here in BC. She said very shortly that I needed an ambulance. I had also bitten a chunk and split my swollen tongue loose on the right side. I couldnt stop focusing on that loose piece of my swollen tongue. 

I was working on a farm helping my bro grow pot in a barn. He had given me multipke chances and paid me well..in cash. Most of which went straight to dope. And eventually some coke when I discovered how nice ut was to shoot coke. By itself or with heroin. 


He moved me out there to get ne away from dope.  Considered drug testing me, but found it infintile. He dropped me in the town I grew up in and used in all the time. But was suspicious ever since the first time a co-worker found bloody alcohol wipes lazily tossed where a sink should be in an unfinished barn bathroom. I would load two needles and keep them at the bottom of my lunch bag on harvest days and shoot up in the bathroom. Below some box of tea. Below the tea bags. Tie the bag a million times so no one could snoop. 

Sometimes I would shoot just coke for work, and work really hard.

When he saw me at the hospital he looked disgusted. ""What the fuck gave you done to yourself, brother. He paid for a taxi home and I had to make small talk with the driver. I got some antibiotics but I was never told what I had for sure. I was told the  swelling would go down eventually...but my lip stayed fat for so long I worried it would stay that way forever. And my mangled tongue took forever to heal.

I was walking on my left ankle for weeks and had numbness and pain for weeks. 

***Any idea what I was suffering from???*** I was discharged the same day with perscription strength antacids and ""serious antibiotics"".

My brother said I had to move out and go to treatment or take my zero savings and figure something out. Lesson learned. Always save lots of money ^_^

I swore I woukd never shoot up agsin and I ended up finding a point when packing after getting better. Snorted a bit. Shot the rest. I got a weird red spot on my eye that eventually went away. I was still taking antibiotics. ....I couldn't bear to tell him I shot up again. 

I used to hide my needles and dope in the stove. Deep in the weird foam or whatever fiberglass like material that was near the wires of that gas stove.

To get high I would move the stove and reach into the front of it from the back. Once I cooked a sausage roll from the store and panicked about the little metal container full of little dope baggies when I realized what was happening.

The fucking bags melted together and to the container. I had something like 300$ worth of dope in there. I salvaged every bit I could. Shooting every bit I could. 

That's the worst time in my life. Living on that farm after a bad breakup and years of shooting up. But I had a lot of fun too. No internet. Only left to go to town or sleep at a friends house. 

New years he finds a needle full of dope in his shower. I did one forgot the other. Tells me he'll take some pity on me. Kicks me out at 6AM New Years Day. 

At the time I think...good. now I can k6st ho to town...pick up..and go right back to the farm. Seeing my best friend was a hassle.

My main DOC was cocaine, but I got into pills and then chiva when it was popular in the late 90s.

My boyfriend is pretty much constantly on something anymore (like stop after a 30 minute skype call to get high, then call me back type shit). Weed and alcohol are pretty constant, Xanax was his DOC but he kept getting shitty presses because the doctor wouldn't give him anymore, so he's doing more and more opiate pills (mostly crushing/snorting them). Uses various other things (used to do coke a lot, has done meth but I dunno how much, and molly) when they're around. He's used something IV at least some, but won't tell me what and denied it when I asked in the past (I do healthcare and know what track marks look like).

I love the fuck out of him and pretty much just accept all this for what it is. I'd like it to change, but I don't really say anything or hassle him because I know it won't change long-term until he wants it to - basically just gave him & his roommate Narcan and told him to try to be careful.  But it has been an issue in the past where he'll blow me off because he wants to go party and knows I'll be staying straight. And once or twice a year he'll get into this whole depression thing where he starts telling me he's not good enough and just going to drag me down, and talks about breaking things off. Then he'll either end up in the hospital or call me in a day or two and tell me he doesn't mean it and wants to be together. 

I'm just wondering if relationships like this can work out long-term, and how to reassure him and let him know that he is more than worth everything to me and I love him, whatever point he's at in life.

To complicate it more, we're long-distance right now because of school/work and because I have a son and can't have anyone living with me and using while he's around.

A few weeks ago(no more than a month) i had trouble hitting the vein on the side of my wrist(cephalic) and ended up waiting too long and the blood inside the needle ended up coagulating and like an idiot i injected it there.



It hurt and i could feel the lump of blood afterwards,since then i havent touched that vein, but sometimes my hand(the hand with the vein i injected in) feels weird, the tip of my fingers get tingly sometimes(RARELY)

My hand just feels a bit weird and i keep wondering if this is because of the incident and somehow i damaged the circulation to my hand,like i made myself had a blood clot from this.


On the other hand, i think of all the iv users who have blown veins and take about an hour to get a shot, they drawn blood into the needle and it coagulates a lot more,they injected and they're fine.


I know some of you have been through this, do i need to go to a doctor? does blood coagulated blood return to normal after injected and going through the body?

Never been physically addicted either. Can count the number of times over the last 6 years I had gotten high on them. Usually months apart, fortunately. However, there's nothing else in the world I have ever loved more than them, and I have no doubt I will one day become an addict. That I guarantee. 

It won't be a way to cope with past traumas or pain or a shitty reality. It will be due to this lingering feeling of dissatisfying purposelessness, boredom existential crisis depression, you get the idea. For some people, anhedonia is just how they were born with - extremely broken/dysfunctional pleasure centers, before they even touched drugs, at least that's definitely the case for me. I don't remember ever having long periods when I'm just a content person able to enjoy things. 

My dad told me a few years ago (I'm 27) that when I was in 2nd grade, only 6 years old (started school a year early) I came back home one day, and was just extremely frustrated, said to him ""everything is boring everything is the same, we wake up we go to school we come home we eat, do homework, play a little go to bed, and then wake up again to do the same"". I do not remember saying any of that or that say at all, but pretty sure my dad realized that day a shitstorm is coming the older I get. Well. It's been 21 years since, and I fully stand behind what I said as a 6 year old. 

SSRI and therapy and working out and eating healthy yadyada, no matter what I do, nothing helped. I do sometimes have brief moments of satisfaction from small short rewards, like doing well on tests, getting promoted, etc, but they last a day or two at most, before I resume to my ""what's the point"" set of mind. 

Other than times when I am validated and getting those feel-good rewards in my brain, from external sources, I started to slowly but steadily feel nothing. And the older I've gotten, the more rare and harder to get my brain to release any fucking endorphins. Nothing is never enough. Doing any sort of regular activities hasn't been enjoyable to me in years. Going out or getting food with friends is not enjoyable. Going to the park with my dog is not enjoyable. Watching a show I would claim to enjoy is only a way to completely distract myself from my own thoughts. Nothing gives me joy, my pleasure center just stopped releasing endorphins. 

Life has been just deteriorating to almost entirely joyless, pure anhedonic nihilism for me. And though nobody on this sub would consider me an addict, I will be one. A big one. It just hasn't yet happened. 

At 21 I had minor tiny surgery on my wrist. Just a small ganglion cyst removal, no bones or muscles even involved. I actually had an option to drain it like most people choose to, but I heard the word surgery, and I knew that meant painkillers, and I swear on my life, that even though I had never taken an opiate at that time, I was already enchanted by them. Watching dr. House pop Vicodins  every episode gave me this hinge that I need those. I want those. I have got to try them. Surgery day came, was awake for the full 45 minutes sedated on something warm and cozy, enjoying the bliss. When it was over and I was unhooked from everything, nurse immediately came up to me worried about ""how much pain I'm in"" as the numbing wore off...no pain whatsoever, but I knew exactly what would happen next, so I put on my best hurting face, told her it's just getting pretty intolerable, as she decided that ""its better I take two of these"" right away as my parents signed my release and I was getting up and walking out of the hospital. My first two Oxys. Swallowed down. We live about 10 minute drive from there so when we get home it has JUST started kicking in, and this was it. This was love. Finally. I think I spent my entire high on Facebook chatting to everyone. Talking to anyone was just this amazing feeling of connecting and loving them. Everything was great, the universe was great, life was just this amazing experience and I couldn't believe why I ever thought it was dull. I wasn't supposed to be driving for a few hours after so I just enjoyed my new love of life until later that evening, went to get my script filled, 30 Oxys, 10 mg I believe, which I know here is not much, but with zero tolerance, or was more than enough to keep me happy for a month. By the next day I started calculating when and what to use them for. I planned activities and chores around when I was going to take them. I wanted to always be high obviously, but I'm also OCD with my plans and like to rationalize every piece of my schedule. 

Anyways, ran out of my surgery Oxys in 2.5 weeks. Did everything in my power to try and get another legit script but no luck. For the 3 weeks after I ran out, opiates were all I could think about, I don't ever want to live life how I've been living it, being sober and living my life majorly depressed with no relief, is just... not for me. 

Skip forward to 27 year old me, tonight. I am mentally obsessed with opiates, yet that right there, my surgery at 21 years old, was my longest binge. Have since had maybe a couple of 3-4 days supply of weaker hydros or tramadol but I can probably count the number of times that happened, over the last 6 years. Never been physically addicted obviously. But I have no doubt in my mind at some point I will be. 

My OCD has been strangely stronger than my addictive personality (I would explain what I mean by that,  but it's almost 2am, so maybe another time), and that's the only reason I have been able to postpone my future addiction, hopefully a few more years, when I'm just filthy rich, and can afford a luxurious addiction cycle.  Get high every day, build a tolerance, get physically dependent, check into 2 months detox rehab, the nice ones, wherever Lindsay Lohan goes, sign me up. Build my tolerance down, check out of rehab, and get high again. It's all about being able to afford my addiction. Just need a few millions rolling in the bank, dear god I hope I have that some day.  

If I end up not making millions then I will wait until I'm 70. My last few years on earth will be one giant euphoric hell of a time and there will mostly be no consequences as I don't plan on having kids (worrying they might inherit my depressive genes) and hopefully the person I marry will be down with this plan. Spend down our 401k and retirement on the on happiest drugs on earth in the happiest place on earth (so what, I like Disney and its evil corporation ways, sue me). 

The thought of a future of being able to get high til I die is what's keeping me alive. ",1501751796.0

I am currently reflecting on how I got to where I am now and I'm balling my eyes out even though I'm high as a kite on 100mg of oxy 

A day after New Years I was robbed with a machete by 4 16 year old kids in methamphetamine. I was in a rural city doing university to become a primary school teacher and the area is known as one of the worst Australian towns for the ice epedemic.

Anyways, I lost $25k worth of assets ,my dj gear and my car made up majority of the value 

But the worst part was they sliced my beautiful little girl up. Sorry, not my child, my fur baby , my 18 month old little whippet girl.

She was the best dog I've ever had and she didn't deserve what happened. I go over the incident and see her copse and the blood and the flesh that was exposed in vivid detail all the time. It really really really hurts to write this but I need to get over it and fuck it I feel comfortable talking to internet random addicts than anyone else in the world.

Opiates provide me with immense relief of all my hang ups and I don't think about the incident as much when I'm on them. I don't like to go to sleep on drugs but I like getting as high as I can and still being able to function.

It's getting to hard and expensive to maintain my addiction but I've started to notice the ripple affects of my addiction happening to my family.

I want to go back to being drug free. Do you think after paying all my civilian debts, I should save up the money and buy another whippet? I'm just scared I'm not going to give her the love she deserves as I'd imagine I'm gonna be fucking ultra depressed and have no energy when I'm clean.

Pls talk to me and help me feel better :( I miss my baby girl so much, I wish I didn't take her out with me.. I wish I reacted to the situation quicker and protected her :(",1501741127.0

The chilly air of my front porch at night makes me shiver. I had been sweating through my shirt in the garage two minutes earlier.


Lighting the cigarette and sucking in past my sore gums and raspy throat, the slight head rush made me forget the shitty day for just a moment. I pulled out my phone and flipped through. What goes with tonight, hm? 'The Devil in the Dark'? That's at least an ok one from what I remember. And if not, the joint resting in my pack of cigs will probably enhance the entertainment.


Some miner on a faraway planet gets acid-burned by a space rock creature, Captain Kirk starts telling me about the voyages of the starship Enterprise, and the mosquitoes start to eat me. Usually there will only be a couple of bites. Not a big deal for a few minutes out of the house. The mosquitoes suck, but all of the other insects are fascinating. Watching the spiders spin webs, the ants fight and build, you become part of their world just on the front porch. I have to flick a tiny spider off my chest.


More miners get burned alive and Spock isn't sure what's going on. A quite large ant scurries into my view. It's one of the biggest I've ever seen near where I live, with a full set of wings resting, folded on top of its thorax. I watch it simply move around, with no apparent purpose. Perhaps it was in a new place, simply exploring?


Not that the cig is spent, I can move onto the main course. This episode isn't bad. Sure, the monster is made out of a carpet, but god damn this weed tastes good. That ant keeps running under my folded leg. I shift position to avoid crushing it. My other leg starts itching. A tiny buzzing annoyance is flying off with my blood, with which to incubate countless other tiny buzzing annoyances. My life essence will spawn evil. My red cells are going to come kamikazing back at me so they can fuck and breed.


Now Spock is mind-melding with the space rock alien carpet to try and communicate. Big Flying Ant is running into my leg again. Weed's all done. Another cig? How many is that today? Don't count the pack. Who cares? Just smoke. Don't count the pack.


1,2,3...9. Fuck it, make it an even half. There's still 20 minutes left. I'm sure Kirk will save the day. Arm itches. Let's stand up. If smoking and pacing was an Olympic sport, I'd be on fucking Wheaties.


Kirk and Spock successfully use telepathy to broker a cease-fire between the rock carpet (that was only a mother protecting its eggs) and the human miners. Scotty beams them up and all is well. Was that ant a queen? My entomology isn't that great, but don't all queens get wings?


Staring at my feet on the concrete, another warm rush hitting my mind from the warm smoke, the gleam of animal bodily-fluid shines into my eyes. Resting like a small crushed grape, wings still undamaged, the corpse of the queen had stained the stone beneath it.


I couldn't help but stare. Is this what our lives are? Ants aren't that different from us. Is god just an asshole junkie with a cigarette in his lips, smashing helpless creatures with his faded, torn-up Converses? Nah, that's just stupid psuedoprofound bullshit. Don't be silly. But why is this making me sad? Maybe death just makes me sad.


I kick the queen corpse off into the grass, flick my butt into the tray, and turn the door knob. Time to dream of the morning, when I get to put more Morphine inside of me.

Anyways I'm sick of being in debt, infringement fines snowballing into greater amounts of debt cos I'd rather spend the money on gear, the lies to the family, pulling every excuse in the book out to the boss for why I won't be in today (dope sick, the fucking lactic acid in the legs feeling man , I used to be able but now I can't ), I just need it to stop . It's getting annoying and what's the point of using drugs if half the time you can't even enjoy them cos your worried about other shit like what the duck am I gonna do when this lot runs out??

Anyways enough of the random junkie rambling, I have 200mg of oxynorm left and I'm wondering what I should do with it?

Should I squirt it up my ass for something different ? Should I slam it Into my veins (I don't shoot but I've had 70% pure hammer a few times shot up from a friend, I liked the head explosion but the rest was meh). This is legit tho is it worth seeing what oxy is like slammed into the veins ?

Should I do 2 100mg oral doses ? I usually go 60mg / 80mg max, not that I'm scared or fear of od, more fear of running out too quick) 

Or should I space these bad boys out and ease the withdrawals ? I'm prepared to pay the final price for kicking the habit tho, see junkie rant above.

I got off of opiates for like 2 weeks then started smoking some every 2 or 3 days then every day. Since then I've been smoking and/or snorting it because my roommate who I'm living with for free was super against it even though he snorts like a gram a day. I must say that smoking and snorting it has been a real bummer. Yes it makes my wds way more bearable but I crave the needle. Today after work I walked like 2 hours to get a rig from a cache of supplies I left should I find myself on the street and got a rig I'd hidden there. Then when home I did a shot of some shit I thought was bunk af and it actually gave me a rush. The shit did nothing for me when smoked and snorted yet a small shot felt great. I know I shouldn't start banging it again since I have a job I can't wear long sleeves to and my gf gets out of prison this month and will look for tracks but fuck I miss doing shots. Never start shooting or odds are it will be your R.O.A. forever. Smoking it is fun but with the shit I've got currently it just doesn't do shit. Guess it's straight fent+cut. I've been smoking a little ice also but with meth I can't stand shooting it. I've done it a few dozen times but never again. Is it odd that I don't think twice about shooting h but cringe at the thought of shooting meth? The last time I did it there was a burning that felt like it was going up my arm. I only do meth when I've done a lot of dope and only if it's offered to me. A lot of people I know will always ask if I want to smoke a bowl and when I say yes they pull out an ice pipe and pass it around. Took me a while to get used to smoking a bowl mean smoke meth instead of weed.

I put 2mg usually into an emptied out nasal spray bottle (can buy empties online. I emptied out one of the many bottles layin around the house). The old school types of bottles work best. The ones with the little pump and tube bullshit. The name brand ones arent really built this way. 

Now put your sub dose into the empty bottle. Warm up some sterile water 10 seconds in microwave. Make sure it is not too hot, and measure out ar least 3mLs. (Or be like me and just drip a small amount in that bitch out of a bottle cap. Half a bottle cap is plenty. 

Then, tighten the lid on your drug/warm water mixture and shake like u are having the fap of your life. Now this shouldnt take too long (kinda like WD fapping) because of the warm water mixing the pill/strip up so efficiently. After feeling your shaking is adequate, open it up amd check to see if any residue is left unmixed. Dont want that. If it is all mixed u are good to go!

Enjoy slightly less damaging and more efficient way to dose this medicine. Your sinuses will pay over time so do not overdo it. Trust me. Mine are so constricted it hurts sometimes. 

Fuck, on second thought dont do this, but the people asked so here we are.

Edit: if you are really in a pinch, you can just mix sub with warm sterile water, draw a couple mLs up in an oral syringe, lean your head back and *slowly* drip the solution in a drop at a time. Dont snort! Just lightly breathe and if you feel the liquid draining down throat too fast,  tilt your head completely forward, perpendicular with the floor. Hold till it dries. I also do this trick with the spray bottle after spraying a ton of liquid up there that wont stay in place.

I started using oxy when I was 14 and we all know the slippery slope. By 16 I was smoking tar, only my closest friends knew but I lived in AZ (hope I didn't break the rule) and if anyone has been there for awhile you'd understand that it's a cesspool of misery. The only things to do is get drunk and high. I remember the first ""hard"" drug I did was coke, I felt incredible. Being the young and naive kid I was I thought I could use socially... There is no social use. I quickly switched to meth (price, longer high, yadda yadda) and at the time I could take it or leave it. So, I thought ""hey I bet heroin is pretty rad"" it was (as most of you know) beyond rad... words just can't describe it. I didn't know it at the time but, I was hooked. But, enough of that. One morning I woke up sick, as normal, and said fuck it I don't want to be the person looking back at me in the mirror. I have done things that before I used I thought that's the worst you can do. I quit cold turkey. Fuck me in the ass it was horror. But, after detoxing I forced myself to start going on walks and shit like that. Every fucking day I think about using. But, I decided to go to NA and if you go in there with the want to stay clean the people take you in. We know each others pain, we have all been in the same hell just different rooms. Addiction is a chronic, painful, and fatal disease. I know that feeling of isolation, lying to everyone, justifying that ""just one more hit, I'll stop tomorrow"" or that feeling of ""this drug has made me it's bitch and there ain't shit I can do about it"", I know addiction turns you into something that's not human, living like an animal because you need the drug to survive and it's always at the top of the shopping list. I know you feel isolated, lost, or hopeless. That's the drug degrading your self image. And I'll level with you guys, sober living isn't easy you have to work for it, it's mundane and sometimes you find yourself alone just reminiscing about getting high. But, if you work for it sober living is kinda rewarding. You get to count each day and you get this feeling of ""holy shit I never thought I'd be able to do this"" not to mention the money you're not spending on drugs starts to build up. Also, your loved ones are proud and that feeling alone is worth it. Just yesterday I sat down with my mom and admitted I was stealing her pills she looked me dead in the eye and said ""I forgive you"". I broke down, I'm the kind of guy to cry but I was crying like a bitch. I'm 20 days sober today. There's hope, even when you don't see it, you don't have to go it alone, you don't have to go cold turkey, the only thing you do need is the want to get clean. It's the drugs making you feel to weak, YOU are strong! As addicts we already know how to take it one day at a time (wake up, call the d-boy, how to get some money today) just give yourself a little faith. I love and feel for you guys and gals (or other, I carry no prejudice) I DO have faith in YOU. Feel free to pm me, I am new to recovery and have learned in NA that sponsors have to have 6 months clean, that's bullshit (as long as you don't feed into the addiction) you just need someone who will help you have faith in yourself and cares for you. For those who don't wanna get clean (which I understand) be safe, the dope game gets deadlier each day.

P.S. Just to let you know I'm 18 and a male.

TL;DR You ARE stronger than you think, you can quit. Know you're not alone. We all carry this disease. But, there IS hope.",1501861346.0

6rjheg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6rjheg/observation_using_gold_md_kratom_for_mild/,4,https://redd.it/6rjheg,sloan_fitch,Observation using Gold MD Kratom for mild withdrawal,"Early in withdrawal I was emitting emotionless bytch tears and other bodily fluid. All shits after my first shit were become liquid coupled with a negative morning attitude, and poor body temperature regulation. Hot and cold from minute to minute. You know when you take a shit and you get this chill that causes a wave of brief tremors through your body? Heck, you can experience similar without opioid withdrawal symptoms. Sometimes a little cold air makes it easier to take a dump but anyway that's what I'm here to talk about today.

&nbsp;

Had a bad experience a couple of months back where I consumed a lot of Kratom encapsulated within capsules made of vegetable gelatin. Some people complain the capsules slow down or seem to reduce the efficacy of Kratom. Can't say if that's true. It stands to be reasoned at least some of the Kratom was metabolized even if some of it perhaps got goopy and stuck to parts of the capsules during digestion. 

**The capsules are appealing because you don't have to taste Kratom at all,** but might reduce the effects a little. I used to think that maybe the capsules played a role in fucking up my stomach, I wont assert that view today but I think the **capsules made it easier for me to ingest a lot more Kratom** than other ROAs. Today, I poured a little under four ounces of OJ and mixed it with two teaspoons of Gold MD Kratom. Drank it as quickly as possible, part of the reason why I barely filled half the cup and avoided that gag reflex that Kratom sometimes brings out. 

&nbsp;

**It was a success, just under thirty minutes later I noticed a change.** For one, the chills in any form albeit minute were gone, body temperature regulation went back to normal, and **I felt a bit of warm buzz**. Possibly more than what I'd feel from snorting a roxy 15, though that's probably because of my tolerance. It wasn't the same feeling so it's not directly comparable but it did effectively relieve the ill effects of withdrawal** that were present at the time.

Of course I was worried it would wear off before work ended. So I mixed another teaspoon of Kratom with the last 1/5 of my up of coffee as I already drank most of the cup. All I ate at this point was three wantons and some Chinese crackers in soup.

&nbsp;

Not long after this, I was already in the process of trying to get subs. It was a last effort before I resigned to the expectation that the subs would not be obtained today. You see, earlier this week on Monday afternoon I asked the friend who usually gets these things when the subs would arrive. He answered me, ""worst case scenario, tomorrow."" Two more days went by with no success. It seemed he was trying to get it, even witnessed a phone conversation on the matter late Wednesday night. You see, he gets the subs from a middle. This middle has to then meet the person who has the subs. My immediate friend also has a connect ho has them for a little less than half price but that person also fell off the face of the Earth and has become excessively unreliable. The last time the cheap sub connect delivered, it was right before delivering a batch of fake Heroin. 

Sure, if the cheap sub connect showed up I'd still be willing to gamble his subs are real even if I don't trust his Heroin anymore. Unfortunately, the **cheap sub connect is NOT available.** He'll text every two or three days to see if my friend wants anything but after he states what he wants **the dboy never follows up.** Therefore, we must go through the middle. **The middle is not far from us but the prices are a little steeper** than what the normal street rate in this area. The **middle is also a little upset at my friend** because he was not willing to sell him a fuck ton of benzosfrom his script. The middle for the subs *can eat or rail three bars in one fell swoop like its his regular thing.** For once I am on good terms with this particular middle and have his contact info so I reached out to him, explained that my friend is ordering on my behalf. Within 90 minutes of getting my first text response we had the subs delivered. The delivery happened within 20 minutes of the ""it's on it's way"" message.

&nbsp;

I'm glad everything worked out in my favor today. I wonder if things would've worked out so well if I didn't contact the middle. **More importantly, final thoughts about the Kratom**; it left a bit of a lingering sensation in my gut. It's probably just working it's way through my digestive tract. This type of plant matter absorbs a lot of water so it's critical to hydrate. The stomach sensations are similar to what felt like hell two months ago and are probably less severe because I've ingested far less Kratom today than I did on that faithful week two months ago. The ways I've consumed Kratom successfully thus far agree with my senses that detect flavor but internally and biologically may disagree with my stomach to some degree. The **degree of stomach pain is proportionate to the amount of Kratom ingested** and lots of water is required in both cases.


**UPDATE:**

The minor stomach bloating sensation that I felt before going to bed that was less severe than the agony of two months ago.. turned out to get stroger just from laying down. Totally ruined my sleep. I managed to get some sleep only by sitting upright in a comfortable recliner. If not for that recliner, I would not have gotten any sleep.

The Kratom obviously doesn't agree with my stomach. A shame because it did work to relieve some of the symptoms. Good thing I hustled to get that sub.

**Update 2:**

It's just like the last time I did kratom. My stomach hurts after every meal. It's not as bad only because I didn't consume as much Kratom as last time. I consumed no more than five grams as of 24 hours ago and have not consumed anymore since. 

I suspect the Kratom would agree with my stomach better if I drank three times more water and drank no coffee whatsoever. Hopefully some fiber will help. It's so annoying because I feel like a 100% except for this Kratom stomach.",1501840887.0

Having heard so much about opiates and their 'charming' effects, I was pretty eager to try them.

I had no tolerance whatsoever, never did any drugs or even alcohol before. Only thing I tried is kratom, where 1 gram of (regular leaf) powder would go a long way.

Anyway, back to the oxy. First night I tried 20mg IR. Nothing. I felt absolutely nothing. Not high, and also not in less pain.

Second day I tried 35mgs and potentiated with tonic, magnesium, and those stomach things (not sure what brand they are called in the USA, but they were 'recommended' by the webs).

After a few hours I got sleepy and itchy. Also mildly sensitive to light. But nothing to get excited about.

A few days later, after my GP confirmed I could just take as many as needed, I decided to go hard; took 70mgs oxy IR at once, and another 60mgs 30 minutes later.

I slept for 1.5-2 hours, that's it. No joy, no less pain, no euphoria, no high. Not even sick because of the amount.

With the fentanyl, I only felt 'good' the time they gave me an IV shot in the ambulance. In the hospital I got the nasal spray to take care of the pain at home, but even 300-400mcg doesn't do squat. 

I read fent makes your tolernace shoot up, so I'd rather not use that and at home I am sticking to oxy. But, why am I not getting any pleasurable effects? Or pain killing ones, for that matter?

(please don't tell me to run while I can and how I should be glad I'm not getting any joy from them. I am fully aware of that and normally I couldn't agree more with you. However, I only got them prescribed cause I have only weeks to live so I can't really care about getting addicted or not at this point. I just want to have  a 'good' few last weeks)",1501839834.0

Not a frequent opioid user at all, but I've found Tapentadol to ever hardly be discussed. It's still apparently new and unknown. I have some experience with it for ""medical"" reasons and would just like to shed some information on it. Not encouraging use, just maybe helpful information.
_______________________________________________

Tapentadol (Nucynta, which comes in ER which is shit) is a fairly potent U-Opioid Receptor Agonist, with a comparable potency (in terms of U-Opioid Effects) to anything from Codeine, to Morphine. Tapentadol is based off Tramadol. Tramadol's main issues invovled seizure risk due to SERT+NET affinitys, metabolism dependent, and relatively weak U-Opioid Agonisim. 

Tapentadol was developed using pre-existing data from Tramadol. It is, essentially Tramadol ver.5.0. 
Tapentadol maintains Tramadol's ""dual-mechanism"" of SERT and NET reuptake, except this time, it's SERT reuptake is negligible, and it's NET reuptake is strong. Tapentadol is essentially, Tramadol that requires no metabolism for effects, lessened seizure risk due to negligible SERT affinity, and a significantly more potent, U-Opioid and NET ligand.

_______________________________________________

It's a good opiate. It's not to strong, and
surely not weak. It's very mood uplifting presumably because of dual NET reuptake and potent U-Opioid agonisim. It can feel like many different things at different doses. It can provide common opiate like effects, depending on formulation, and dosage. It's probably worth
further research. Highly underrated.

Original--->
Took hydrocodone syrup as my first experience.  Then about a year later (17) I was given a green 15mg oxy...  I didn't know it yet but I was mentally addicted already.  Proceed to the next school year-im 18 and I finesse a girl in my class to give me her 58 remaining 5mg oxys from a 60 script received for her wisdom teeth removal (!?!?!).  I hadn't had anymore opiates until I got these.  I originally planned to sell them, but after taking two and melting in class into a cozy, mellow bliss, plans changed.  I gave some out for free and took at least 15 mg a day and probably 30 on a heavy day.  Didn't get an actual connection for steady opiates until I started my freshman year of college and met R in miami.  He was my dealer through the year for everything from coke to oxys and even weed when I wanted to splurge on some fire (19).  I tried heroin the next summer.  Snorted a few bags over to day's, went a week and a half and copped more, then began copping as much as possible.  You know the story.  But cut- because this all happened just about three weeks ago.  I had my first IV experience about 4 days ago and did it last, last night.  I am now forcing myself to quit because this shit is consuming.

He had the nerve to say that we were just boys exploring our anatomy playing games. I quickly pointed out that he was 15 fucking years old and in puberty and I was a 6 year old boy who worshipped this kid. His messages to me today were so fucked up and I'm again left wondering if I did something wrong. I know this is very private but I don't care. I needed to vent.

6rg8he,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6rg8he/having_a_shit_night_literally/,17,https://redd.it/6rg8he,lackofreality,Having a Shit Night (literally),"Ok, I read the post about an unfortunate incident during anal sex. I was then inspired to share my experience on what promised to be an outrageously magnificent experience. 
I was going to having a threesome with 2 guys one being my partner, and the other had been carefully selected, a friend with a filthy mind, who was good looking and who would be discreet, and and be cool about the situation to come. For a long time I wanted to try double penetration, it'd been on my bucket list for ages, and the night arrived; this was really going happen, I was nervous, and beyond excited.

We get into it, first (my partner, now known as guy 1) guy 1 is in my pussy, so second (now known as guy 2, literally) guy goes round the back and penetrates  Now, after having kids I can recognise that really heavy feeling down below, like there was no room in there at all to make this happen, to make any movement at all happen.  But I am not one to be a quit (lol), and it began to feel really sexy, kinky and forbidden (the forbidden aspect makes it more spectacular).  That was until Guy 2 pulls out of my ass.       

I mean everything to the point had been really wicked.  As soon as guy 2 withdraws out comes tumbling quite a hefty clump of shit. It was quite soft, due to the large amounts of coke we'd been using all night long, I stupidly thought I'd be bunged up from the pills I use (for pain relief I tell thee)!. The shit lands partially on guy 2's lap he moves so quickly, it partially falls onto  the edge of the sofa, and majestically rolls onto the beautiful stone floor belonging guy 1.  The previously beautiful stone floor was now not so pretty to look at anymore.  
I too was covered in my own shit.  I then became aware of a rumbling of bad big time flatulence, signalling the fan fare,  indicating the arrival of yet more shit to come along and join the party, and so it did, but I managed to catch that piece!

The worse was yet to come as the family dog, alerted by the smell of strange shit came over for a lovely sniff, and was growling at anyone who attempted to move him, he really seemed delighted at the pungent aroma, his tail wagging furiously. At that moment, the dog was the only one in the room who seemed to be enjoying themselves. The small permeated every inch of the room.
We all looked at one another wide eyed, and they both went limp instantaneously. I just had to front it out and then picked up more of the shit with my bare hands off the floor as if it were a every day occurrence.Exit me, shower, bleach??
After that we never talked, nor made any mention about the situation. If anyone is thinking of it, maybe make sure that shit really can't happen!
This really happened unfortunately, and this is the first time I've disclosed it.  I feel safe to do so, as you lot are deviant.
I'm thinking if we'd got a higher dosage of Oxy's that this would have turned lout very different....Maybe the situation would have been different if we'd consumed a higher dosage of tea?

6rfnfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6rfnfh/how_i_became_an_iv_drug_addict/,61,https://redd.it/6rfnfh,lovepussydrugs,How I became an IV drug addict,"When i was young i was fascinated with sticking my finger in light sockets. My mom used to tell me ""baby go zoot zoot"" in her creative attempt to deter me. Still, i would keep on shocking myself. Doing things i wasn't supposed to felt good if only because it was forbidden. When they told me to never try drugs, same thing. I think i will tell my kids drugs are not the problem. It is doing them daily which is the problem.

By high school i already knew i would become a drug addict. This was before i had ever even seen a maryjewana cigarette. My perceptive friend would always say, ""dude you sound so stoned"". ""You listen to Pink Floyd and The Doors, you gotta be a pothead!"" Well i was sober, but not by choice. I was so antisocial that i never had access. One day i found out the local skate crowd might know where to acquire some of the herbal remedies making up all my daydreams as of late, dozing off to Dark Side of the Moon. I imagined the feeling to be like the orgasmic tonal qualities of the female vocalist in Great Gig in the Sky. 

I wish i could tell you with certainty that it all began that day. Of course i dont believe that. I lean more towards the destiny theory, or wanted to. It was completely inevitable i end up with an insulin syringe full of oxymorphone sticking out the crook of my arm, held in the sturdy hands of my 50 year old pseduo-doctor junky friend who stayed part time in this drug den. on paper it was registered to the sweet old lady taking us in. I'm not exactly sure what made me make the jump to IV use. Okay, maybe it was peer pressure. Maybe it was... you guessed it: destiny. 

How i was led to this situation is a typical story. I was bored and lonely and just generally jaded with life. Depression since high school had caused everything to take on quite a grey, cold quality (kinda like the atmosphere of a fent buzz). All the weed i smoked helped while it lasted. All this smoking led me to meet many strange characters. One day a weed dealer of mine has this 50 year old guy with him in the car. He says ""hey man if u can get any needles i can hook you up. We have hydros."" Now i had used opiates here and there, but i had never been friends with an IV user. This immediately sparked my interest. In the back of my mind i thought ""this is my chance"".

A few more weeks go by of me simply buying hydros and then eventually opana. I would walk the few miles across town to get to my special little drug den. So many different characters lived there: Roxanne, the sweet but sometimes sour (when on benzos she was a bitch) girl who used to tell me im beautiful. I wish i could say the same for her but seeing a woman crying, hanging upside down from a dryer, trying to register in her last good vein in her foot and failing is not flattering. She was literally a bloody mess. Then you have Red, the hyper junky with obvious disease eating away at his liver. He only shot with gigantic needles. I forget what theyre called. Then Bob, son of our town's huge dealer. Last but not least, Dan and Dillon who would become my using buddies for the next sixth months. 

Dan was a wise 50 year old normal ass dude who got divorced for good after years of slowly falling deeper into addiction. I could tell his wife and kids not wanting him in there lives was the main drive behind his search of a chemical hiding place. He taught me more about the dope game than anyone i know. I loved chilling with him, mostly because i had faith in him to always find something for us. He knew everyone. One number fails, onto the next. If that failed we go driving until we find it. 

Now Dillon was probably one of the dumbest kids I've known. He could read but beyond that not much i could say about him. With that said it makes me feel even dumber for letting him be the one to peer pressure me into that shot on that fine, warm day in June. 

It was a normal day like any other, but my life would honestly never be the same after. Well my brain never functioned the same. Relationships were never the same. I walked the normal walk across my small mountain town, felt in my pockets for my 25$ as i turned left up a backroad past the bank. I always recall the dog in the first house on the road barking like rabies where leaking out his ears. Almost like he knew how bad i was about to fuck up. 

I reached ole granny's drug den, going in the front for now because i wasn't labeled as a junky yet in her eyes. I passed Roxanne and a couple other randoms who were resting on the couch. ""Hey sweetie"", she always greeted me in a manner which caused a few butterflies to float up my chest. She was a very attractive woman despite all her self abuse, in her dark sunglasses and tight blue jeans. Her pretty brown eyes had seen as much pain as any miserable person ever had, if they were open. 

I said my hellos and was ignored by the Granny as usual. She knows why I'm here. I make my way back through the kitchen to the backroom, where i see a gnarly site of two dudes sticking themselves like pin cushions. ""Uhh hey yall got opana?"" I hated trying to snort these endo series ones, but that is all they had. I bought a quarter of a 40mg pill for about  25$ (ridiculous). It was then as i tried to leave dillon comes up to me excited. ""Hey man you gotta try it this way! It is so much better! The rush is unlike anything you have seen"". I told him i didn't know how. ""Dan is good at this man, he can hit ya!"" 

Now dan wasn't ignorant. He at least acted like he wanted to talk me out of it even if deep down he knew he wanted me right in the gutter with 'em. Why not? Free drugs for them for finding them for me. This was always my deal. Sharing never bothered me. I have empathy for my fellow addict. He finally saw it in my eyes i had decided my fate 20 minutes ago. ""Okay, we got you a fresh rig.""

As he reached up into a little hidden cupboard for the box of needles, i kinda saw my life flash before my eyes right there. What would my mom think of me now? 

I was in for the electrocution of a lifetime now...

Some asshole today decided to randomly message me to tell me I've disappointed my late father by getting caught up with addicts and mourning the loss of an already wasted life. Then proceeded to tell me I should probably seek help and find a rehab soon or I'll end up just like the rest of my loser friends and I need to stop talking about how an addict was the most important person to me. 

Of course this hit me right in the feels and sent me to my dopeman for an extra morning pick me up. 

I find it disgusting to talk ill of the dead, it's how I was raised. How I assumed everyone was raised. 

Mind you, the night I found out the news this dude randomly messaged me and was trying to have me give him a reason to live he just wasn't feeling life and I told him the bad news as soon as I heard. He told me that sounded like a goddamn personal problem and we should get back to his feelings because he was in a really bad place. 

He is the first person to call me out for my addiction and bring up rehab to me. 

My response is to get high and chill anywhere but home. 

To anybody that has lost loved ones who used did it make you seek sobriety or did you try to numb that pain the best way you know how? Oh sweet opiates you're always so kind during emotionally trying times.

I initially didn't like it because its pretty invasive and I heard that your poop can absorb the drugs if you have some in there. Im constantly constipated because I'm addicted to opiates and have been for awhile and everybody here knows how constipated opiates can make you.

I don't want to shoot up and I don't really get high from snorting heroin anymore. So, a few days ago I got tired of struggling everyday to get high and I just took the plunge with plugging my dope. I went full throttle and ended up plugging a lot of heroin into my butt, and over the next few hours I felt amazing! It even felt amazing and over the next few days.

However, it's now the 5th or 6th day of plugging and I have had to take milk of magnesia everyday in order to clear my bowels so I can plug. Recently, like all yesterday, I have been feeling pain like 1-2 inches inside me. There was also some blood in my syringe after. I also kind of feel like my sphincter is lower now and that my butt hole is much more prominent.

now. its 4 days on STRONG antibiotics later and nothing. im in pain & not getting better.

I dont get my pain med script til monday. I have been needing more pills (she cut me down AGAIN) to cover this new pain so I have subs til monday. 

so my long story short is: I need to make an appt if my infection is not 100% gone by monday. up until monday, I will have subs in my system. tuesday / wed is the next time ill be clean and ONLY have what she prescribes in my system. I know for a 100% fact if I come in for my appt, I WILL be drug tested. and I will absolutely have to wait til a day im clear to be making the appt. 

also a question I was gonna ask: can I volunteer myself or ask if she wants a drug test ? I would rather ask to have one and KNOW im gonna pass vs having my yearly one sprung on me when im picking my meds up. what do you think ?

I'll go first. My career as an addict has probably only begun. It wouldnt surprise me if addiction would lead me to my death eventually. Both my parents have struggled with addiction. My mom died of a heroin overdose when i was 10. I actually went into withdrawal as a baby when i stopped drinking her breast milk lol. She had been struggling with addiction her whole life pretty much. My dad is sober and well now but has abused drugs and alcohol most of his life. He started shooting heroin while homeless in new york when he was 17. Took him about 35 years to get clean from all drugs. My uncle also struggled with addiction. I totally have dem junkie genes lol.",1501782877.0

With some ideas and questions too!","So, there's quite a few routes to synth oxymorphone.  One is oxycodone--->oxymorphone.

https://erowid.org/archive/rhodium/chemistry/oxymorphone.html

Another is naloxone--->oxymorphone

I'm not gonna bother finding a link or paper for this.  It's rather difficult, and IF you have left-over unreacted naloxone then your final product would be useless.  We need the naloxone to save lives anyway.

The first one, though, can be done fairly easy, and oxycodone is, somewhat widely available.  

My main point is the Chinese chemists doing this for us instead of these bullshit fentalogues.  OTC oxy in china--->oxymorphone and even use some AA on that.  Hmmm, I wonder if any chinese chem companies would do a custom synth?  Sorry, if this bores people.  I'm, more or less, thinking out loud here, so to speak.

Yes it gets tedious for the mods to have to have to look at and delete posts and make judgement calls but Thats what's mods are here for to moderate. I feel like lately some of you guys have been very quick to just lock down threads. I think the posts should be open for discussion. As imho(which may be worth shit) it does more good than bad and could save a life and that's why we are here. 

I absolutely get it that it's annoying to police posts constantly removing specific comments but again that's why we have moderators in the first place not to shut down entire conversations but to remove things against the rules. Lately it's come down to ""I don't feel like reading all these posts or it may start drama so I'm preemptively locking this post""  where specifically speaking on fent warnings it's a good thing to have an open discussion (as long as no sub rules are being broken during the discussion)  

I in absolutely no way mean this as an attack on our moderators as they have to walk a tight line between free and open speech and discussion and making sure the rules of the road are not broken but like I said previously I've recently noticed a heavy hand on the lock button and sometimes the excuse given is ""I don't wanna deal with this"" I'm sorry that's why your a moderator is to deal with it.  

I can't stress enough that I'm not hating on our mods and I'm not talking shit or attacking them im just voicing an opinion and trying to create a discussion. 

If we are a harm reduction forum than conversation and education are required. Sometimes the description may be vague or misunderstood and in this lifestyle can cost a life.

I feel like such a piece of shit.  Sorry for the long post...I'm very anxious and scared about this.

I started seeing a pain doctor a while back for chronic pain due to an autoimmune disorder that affects my knees, hips, and shoulders.  This was my first time going to a pain management doctor.  He started me off on 5mg hydrocodone.  This dosage did very little, if anything, for my pain. We slowly moved up the ""tree"" until I finally found that 20mg oxycodone helps me tremendously.  When I made the switch to oxycodone, I hadn't been taking my hydrocodone as much because it wasn't very effective, so I still had a good amount of hydrocodone left (maybe 30 pills? I never counted...still have a few, actually).  

I try my best to take my medication as prescribed but sometimes the pain gets very bad and the medication doesn't help as much.  I bought a pill organizer so I wouldn't be taking more than my allotted medication for the day.  Unfortunately, when I'm having a terrible pain flair-up, I would have to pull from other days.  This meant I was often a few pills short by the end of most months.  To compensate for this, I (stupidly) took some of my leftover hydrocodone because I was terrified of withdrawals (new to opiates, never experienced WDs but I had read enough to scare the shit out of myself).  

So, for a few months, I would end up a couple pills short on my oxycodone and take a few (2-3x 10mg) hydrocodone throughout that last day before my appointment.  I never heard a peep from my doctor.  Everytime I went in for urine analysis (UA), his assistant would only check off the ""oxycodone"" box on the request sheet and have me sign it. Thus, I figured everything was fine...well I guess I was wrong.

Today I went in for my appointment and he kinda blindsides me saying ""we have a problem.""  He tells me almost every month since he switched me to oxycodone, I've tested positive for both oxycodone and hydrocodone in my UA.  He asks ""where are you getting the norco?"" and I told him that they were leftover from when I made the switch to oxycodone but he refused to believe that.  He told me if ""I get audited and a DEA agent asks me why this patient is testing positive for a drug he's not prescribed and I told him the patient had leftovers from a few months ago, he'd call me an idiot"" (he's always been very vocal about his fear of the DEA).  He asked me probably 3 or 4 times ""where are you getting the norco from?"" and every single time I said it's from YOU!  He still refused to believe me.

He wrote me my script for oxycodone and said if I test positive today for hydrocodone that he can't see me anymore.  Well, I'm almost certain that I *will* test positive as I took 15mg of hydrocodone yesterday during a particularly bad flair-up.  On top of all this, he *always* leaves the doors of the rooms open so I'm certain that the entire office could hear what was happening.  The lack of privacy had me frozen with anxiety, shame, and embarrassment, which surely made me look like a complete liar.

Looking back, there were many things I did wrong here.  I'm not trying to play the victim card here.  Although I didn't know it, I was breaking the ""rules"" and that is not acceptable.  I put ""rules"" in quotation marks because I never signed a contract and was never given a sheet with the ""rules"" on it.  Had I known I was putting myself in jeopardy like this, I certainly wouldn't have been taking the hydrocodone.  I thought the ""golden rule"" was to only receive pain medication from ONE doctor and I never broke this. I understand that I was self-medicating and doctors do not like this.  Yes, in hindsight, I should have talked with him about increasing my dosage (which I was actually planning on doing today) instead of self-medicating, but this was always very stressful and anxiety-inducing for me due to the entire office hearing me (a young male) try to justify why I need more opiates.  Like I said before, there's always been a lack of privacy at this office which is part of the reason it made it so difficult for me to even muster the courage to discuss a dosage increase.  I just wish he had told me after the first month, ""hey, cut it out with the hydrocodone.""  I would have happily obliged.  Hell, I'd have handed over the rest of my hydrocodone right then and there.

So...**what do I do now**?  Do I have a ""red flag"" on me that will prevent me from being accepted by another pain doctor?  My anxiety and pain are very high right now.  I have 6 years worth of medical records documenting my condition.  Is all of that going to be outweighed by my misstep(s) here? 

Right now, I'm assuming the worst and planning on slowly weaning myself off the oxycodone when I get that last refill.  Then, it's back to my old life of constant chronic pain (which I put up with for over 5 years before finally seeing this pain doctor).

Fuck.  I'm so god damn stupid.",1501886941.0

I've been here 3 weeks, getting antibiotics every 4 hours, and along with those meds, I'm getting 4mg of Dilaudid into an ISI line (basically like a subcutaneous IV port) every four hours with it as withdrawal management. here in Canada they have no problem keeping you comfortable as they know they're treating the infection, not the addiction. So anyways, 4mg of hydromorphone every four hours is nice, but as a subcutaneous shot, it leaves something to be desired. especially after 3 weeks. 

I got a new ISI line put in two days ago, and I saw them inject 4mg of hydro into the line, insert it under my skin and then pump another 4 mg for my shot. I didn't even think of it, but they prime the line first . So I've been walking around 4mg of hydro dangling from my arm at all times. Lol so of course I found a syringe barrel and drew the hydro up, and plunged it into my central iv line (sterilized and the flushed the line after) and I gotta say, it sure beats subcutaneous. So now I play this game of trying to save up large shots of liquid d by holding off. Just did a 12 mg shot lol  ... 

No point to this really but I mean, this is pretty awesome lol. I was getting to the point of wanting to steal some vials of D from the medicine cart, but this is safer legally and pretty much impossible to detect.

6 weeks in the hospital is tough, gotta be creative a bit. Would you guys do this? Or what are reasons I shouldn't do this? Are there any ? Lol again just bored laying in my hospital bed waiting for my next shot.

It *is* possible to stop these evil urges in our brains with healthier ones. My sweet and creative friend described to me a room which she imagined in her mind, analogous to her happy place. 

It was an old school style mansion with modern funiture. The specific room she described was the library. She mentioned how it had a nice, strong maple(?) smell from all the bookshelves. There was even a ladder with which to climb up to the second story. A desk sits in the middle with a nice fountain pen on top, just for looks. There are ballpoint pens in the drawer in case you actually wanted to write. In the back corner sits a fireplace burning some freshly cut wood from the old tin shed outside. She continued on with so much detail, i really was experiencing this room myself.

Now, the details aren't so important. What is important is that temporarily, as i lie in bed barely conscious, was that my demons shut the fuck up for a few minutes. I admired her on the spot creativity and just appreciated the fact someone would put this kind of effort into entertaining a tired mind like mine.

Open for details. But.. much does time play into even small super small does of subutex?,"Ok.. so here we go.. it's been a month since I got ""high"" last thing I done  was rail some hydromodphone..

Anyways my brother gave me ONE 8mg subutex.. before that I had about the equivalent  of half of one whatever the zubsolv equates to.

Anyways for the past month or a little more..

I'd snort a few tiny lines of the zubsolv. .then the subutex...every morning..

I made one 8mg subutex last at least 3 or 4 weeks... ONE 8 MG SUBUTEX. .3/4WEEKS

Now with that small of an amount of butex does the amount of time I was doing it factor into blocking time..if so how much..

It's been over 24 more like 27 hours since I last snorted subutex...

I just took 20 MG oxy and 30 MG hydrocodone... because I started to feel a bit of a wd feeling...

And I'll be honest I'm a recreational user.
I have never done H.. I have went through some rough binges..spending a lot if money on pills... but never H. 
I have never shot up either...

I can use opiates and not go out and start pawning everything I own because of my habit..

My brother however is a a recovering addict.. has done H.. takes 16 to 24mg of sub a day...

He just had a baby..he has been clean for over a year outside of subutex.. his wife the same.

We all recently got a house together.. and he gave me that 8mg sub thinking I had a problem as bad as his but he started to think differently after seeing how long I made that fucking thing last.

If I had to estimate I'd say it was either .25 MG a day of subutex I snorted..sometimes less ..sometimes a tad mode..

Either way I just ran out of the pill yesterday it's been over 24 hours.. it's been about 28...


In my safe in my room I have about ten 10mg hydrocodone and about eight 10mg oxy...

Long story short.. how much do I need to take or how much longer do I need to wait to get the full effects of my opiates ?

I know this question is one asked a lot but this one is a bit different than most.. and I figured maybe someone here has experienced something similar when running out of their sub trying to ration it out or whatever.


I tried to Google the shit but I couldn't really find an answer to this question..

So I thought maybe someone here could help me...

Now I had no problem about a month ago breaking through the subutex wit dilaudid but hydromodphone is different as far as  breaking through ability 

And also different in that even snorting it...it's not that euphoric ... it kills pain good and numbs you put good but yea..so it was used to tell how much it was breaking through.  

Anyways any help would be greatly appreciated...

Here are some other things that may factor in..

I haven't ate  in about 24 hours..
I'm a male.. 6ft1.. 168lbs.. 37yoa 

I have high metabolism combined with a job that makes me sweat my ass off. 

I also have about 10 Xanax bars in my safe. 

And one 8mg suboxone strip.

 I would have taken it instead but I have bad anxiety problems and suboxone strip can occasionally make that way worse 

Besides..it's been awhile and I just wanna get high.

Anyways it'll shut up now and hope someone here can help me...

I know if nothing else the hydro and percs will keep me from getting sick.
But in hit gonna lie.. I wanna get high because it's been awhile and I don't wanna waste anymore pills today If I don't need to..

Shit.. took me about 20 or 30 min to type this all out and I'm starting to feel a Lil warm and fuzzy.. 


But any input anyone can give me will kean a lot . 

Thanks for reading.  I know there are some great minds on here and this is a different type of sub back to opiates type tale so figure some of u might enjoy reading it and helping me figure it out. Thanks in advance

Oh yea thought I'd add one of the main reasons I'd also been taking the sub instead of the opiates I normally prefer is because of how dangerous and plentiful fake pills full of fent and god knows what else are.. I have two connections I really trust and they are only open for business status once a month first of the month normally each and they normally get rid of ebsthubf rhey have fast because of how hard it is to find trustworthy connects


I do have legit pain and anxiety problems..

I work 2 jobs.. 3 including side jobs.

I do hvac work during the week and I work weekend at a grocery store.. they grocery store took away my fucking insurance.. so I've been saving to get enough cash to afford a doctor visit and my meds. Hopefully by next month..

Anyways again... any kind of help and insight would he extremely appreciated.",1502032634.0

I don't know if I'm getting bad gear or something. Anyways, here's the thing, I started buying from a new dealer, and his stuff was great, but since two weeks ago, I'm only able to get three or four good hits off the foil before it starts tasting horribly.

When this happens, I'll exhale no vapour (that and the bad taste is how I know I haven't got a good hit). Also, along with the taste I notice discomfort in the throat, as if it were real smoke and not heroin vapour. The strange thing is the beetle doesn't burn or sizzle, it moves normally and so, unlike the early days when I used to burn them badly.

An important fact is that where I live, heroin is sold bundled up with a point of powdered cocaine freebase to help the beetle last longer. The thing is, all the heroin I've scored came like this and I have had no problems when mixing it.

Could this just be badly cut material? Or maybe it's the foil? (The foil I've got right now is quite thin) Has anyone experienced this? I'm thinking of trying to smoke it in a bottle (relatively common around my area), but if this is due to the cut, I'd just be inhaling a lot of shit. Today I'll try getting some new foil, because it's easier than switching providers.",1502023817.0

Don't give up because things can get better, I promise you.","As my history shows and some of you may remember, I used to frequent this sub for a long time and I was extremely bad into heroin for many years and started doing massive speedballs with coke and crack for the last year or so of my addiction. I was quite sure that I was too far gone to actually come back from the abyss of using and I really just gave rehab one last shot for the sake of my parents. I was seriously just waiting to od(and damn near did in the bathroom while I was being admitted) and truly thought all hope was lost. 

I know a lot of you may not like what I used to get out of it but I got onto suboxone, something I had fought for years and it worked. It allowed me to get my shit together and find happiness and a fulfilling life while setting aside the physical aspect for a while. In my experience I've found that what I really needed was an opportunity to tackle one thing at a time when it came to overcoming this monster. So I set aside the withdrawal and huge cravings aspect of it for a while(the coke/crack cravings were BAD but subs still helped a lot) and worked on my life. I got a job in a warehouse and absolutely threw myself into work with the same ferocity with which I scored. And it paid off tremendously.  I have an apt that I pay all the bills for, a job that I'm excelling at with bosses who rely on me and continue to give me opportunities to advance and while my life may be simple and I still have some issues hanging over my head from my use(debt mostly), I'm happy. I never thought I'd be able to feel this way but I'm happy and I don't think I could ever go back to that shit. 

Once I had gotten my life together, cutting back the subs wasn't hard. Even when I cut back a lot and I felt it a little bit it is just totally different when you are so far separated from that life and you have regained a lot to lose again. I'm not deluding myself into thinking I could never slip but right now at least I don't see it happening and that's really all that matters isn't it? I keep progressing and keep distancing myself from that life and things keep getting better and better. I've been conditioning my brain to associate all the good that's come from not using to not using, I remind myself what would happen if I went back and I have quite the history to look back on if need be. 

I know some of you are very much against maintenence, I used to be too and I'm not trying to pitch you subs, I'm just telling you that it has done wonders for me and seriously what is the downside if you fail? Falling back into addiction? The place you're already in? Withdrawal? The withdrawal isn't bad and if you do it slowly it's pretty easy on you. I personally smoke small amounts of weed now as well.  I don't do much, I go through an eighth in 3~weeks and I restrict it to only at night after everything else for the day is done. I don't drink at all but I give myself this and honestly I've found myself wanting it less and less as time has gone on. I like the clarity I have now and while I have no problems with weed, it does take that away from me. 

The point of this long winded nonsense is to show you guys that even someone as bad as me can get past this shit(and seriously look through my history if you question how bad it was) and to offer my help and support to everyone who wants it. Looking at the posts here truly hurts me, I am not judging you I'm just deeply saddened by this crisis and what it's doing to people and the fact that a not insignificant number of you aren't going to make it breaks my heart, it really does.  Because I know that the reason I'm here and others aren't is just chance. I should have been dead many times, I basically od'd on camera in this sub before and it's pure chance that I made it and many of the incredible people I knew aren't. 

I know this probably won't actually stop anyone from using but I at least want to plant the seed of hope for anyone who thinks there is none and to offer absolutely whatever support I can. If you need someone to talk to, if you have questions or literally anything I can do short of aiding your addiction I not only will but I want to do it. 

Good luck to all of you and I love you all. You're all better than this shit. ",1502021748.0

So I'm in the process of getting clean, it's been about 6 weeks. I moved back home to get clean because of the comfort of home and the support and what not. My dad had also went through a oxy addiction and is 4 years clean now so I thought going there to get clean was a good idea, but boy was I wrong.

   My parents have always been kinda wierd growing up I would get punished for smoking weed even though they smoke themselves when I was younger. My mom is going through an oxy addiction right now too but refuses too see it because its ""from the doctor so it can't be bad"". Even tho she gets sick when she runs out and runs to my grandma or my aunt to get some of there pills, but ""no I don't have a problem"" according to her.

   Anyways so they drug test me now to make sure I'm clean my dad doesn't care that I smoke weed anymore and thinks it's a good thing becuase when they test me if weed doesn't show up then they know I faked the test. That is the ONLY reason my mom is ok with it though.

    So my mom freaked out the other day because she went through my room looking for god knows what and she found a hollowed out pen tube. That pen tube I use for for smoking wax off tin foil because she had taken my rig and torch from me. She's freaking out ""HE'S USING AGAIN!! HE'S USING AGAIN!! THAT UNGRATEFUL BASTARD! AFTER ALL WE HAVE DONE FOR YOU!!""

   My mom hasn't really done alot for me in my recovery other than put me down for it really. Saying things like ""I can't believe you would go and do something like that you fucked up so bad and ruined your life and mine because now I have to worry about you not waking up every morning and having a dead son"". Also things like ""You're so stupid to have let this happen to you"" you know things like that. Anyway she finds that and is yelling I want a piss test I want a piss test. I have no problem taking a test for her so I do. I piss in the cup everything is fine the line for THC isn't there and everything but the line for opiates is kinda faded but there's still a line there.

   She starts to freak out even more yelling I want him out and shit like that, but I'll admit the line for opiates is a little faded but so was the line for cocaine, PCP, and amphetamines was also a bit faded. Now i haven't done any of thoes drugs  so I have no idea why the line would be a bit faded so i offered to take another one for them and i do and all the lines came out solid as fuck except the one for THC which is non-existent.

   This is still not good enough for her, ""look at the pee is so clear he just put warm water in the cup"". Even though the line for THC isn't there I faked the thing according to her. My dad sees that I obviously passed the test but my moms telling him either I leave or she does. So now she's telling me I have to get out of the house now it's not finalized because my dad told me to just stay at my girlfriends house for a few days and come back so we could talk.

    I'm really really hurt over all this because I have been clean and I have been doing the right thing but to my mom I'm still a worthless junkie. I've been fighting the hardest battle of my live and have been making progress but she hasn't seen any of it. I'm being kicked out for not doing heroin..... Has anyone here had to deal with anything like this? What do I do here? I feel absolutely powerless in this situation so much so that I just want to go get faded as fucking fuck...... so if anyone has any advice for me it would be  appreciated.

10mg methadone oral
250 mg tramadol oral
300mg codeine oral
200/250 mg dihydrocodeine oral
20mg morphine oral
15/20mg oxymorphone
That's my opioids experience,i take them always without tolerance.
I wanted to try fentanyl,oral,nasal or trasdermal but i can't find a safe way but yesterday i found a fentanyl nasal spray for a resoneable price,the description is this: 
Fentanyl HCl Nasal Spray 5 ml 1000mcg/ml 
Fentanyl HCl Spray Liquid which should be administered through your nose like any allergy spray. Each of your spray should give you about 100mcg/spray instantly. So this 5 ml bottle can give 50 sprays in total which should be good for your test.

My question is:is it worth?is it safe and how much should i take?

Poorly written stream of consciousness","I've slept three hours in the last 3 days and somehow I'm still going.

Why do I hate myself so much? 

I've been an addict for 11 years now? Fuck. Currently in recovery just like every other junkie who isn't actively using. Hah, who am I kidding. I still use a needle whenever I can, which is daily. It may not be dope, but I'm still actively using. Subs are a blessing and a curse, got me off dope but reinforce my addiction. And I've run out.
I opened pandoras box when I was too ignorant, thinking I was invincible, better than everyone else, to know otherwise and have paid the consequences ever since. Even spent just over a year clean of opiates/oids with only a couple slips that didn't last more than a day or two.

Lying, stealing, and cheating my way through every day has become so normal that I don't even think twice about it. And really, if I didn't my dogs wouldn't eat. 
Of course theres no shard around either, that always helps with w/d. This stream of thought isn't even coherent.

Just rewashed a handful of sub cottons in hopes I could stave off the aches crawling up my back. The physical act of shoving a dull, overused needle into my arm did more than the distinct lack of get well in the cottons.

Found a bottle of T3's earlier, but I don't have my hopes up. Gotta save them for the work week (like that will really happen), not like they'll do much anyway. Can't even shoot codeine, what's the point? Eating the whole bottle might get me off E, but junkie relationships mean everything gets split lest blood get spilled. I'll be as useless as they will shortly.

I don't know whats worse, sub withdrawal or dope withdrawal. Dope is a week +/- a few days of writhing agony. I't stab a baby in the throat for a fix coming off the shit. Sub withdrawal gives a whole new meaning to the term 'lethargic'. Not writhing in pain but motivation to do anyting is non-existent. My dose is low enough that I don't spend every second trying to crawl out of my skin, but getting up and doing anything makes me want to kill myself. And it seems to go on forever. Even after a month without there is little improvement, and I""m going into day 1. Again. Fucking waste of space.

And I'm supposed to be the strong one. I know she feels just as bad, and I gave her her first taste, so I feel responsible. Guess who gets suck it up and take care of the pups and us. Thankless work, yet here I am. Goddamn this is depressing. I guess it could be worse. I still feel responsible for the one person whose going through it all with me, even if I don't feel responsible for myself. The house could be on fire.

I care more about her than me. She deserves better.  I love her with everything in me, and I'm complete shit at showing it. I hope she knows. I know she doesn't feel the same about me, but she tries. We were both delt a shit hand this life, not like we make it easier on ourselves. Tragedy, death, and despair is all that's left in our wake but we're still here. Co-dependance is dangerous when you're at each others throats when sobriety sets in. But it's better to feel whole than spend this alone missing your other half. If it wasn't for her I probably wouldn't be here, and if I was I'd most definitely be worse off.
Every time things seem to start looking up something else happens. Was so close to getting ahead and another shitstorm rained down upon us. Set us back literal months. It was so close we could taste it. For the first time it wasn't self sabotage either. Shit crumbled from all sides with us struggling to hold things up in the middle, being crushed, yet again, in the process. I've overdrawn so many accounts that I'll never be out of debt and it just keeps piling up. Fuck me right? Always making grade A decisions in the moment. My impulse control is gone. Will power barely exists. I am my own worst enemy.

At least if I had some meth I'd have a reason for being awake all night. Sleep deprivation is a fucked up drug when there's no associated dopamine overload. 400mg of Gabapentin hasn't done shit to tire me out. 

Fuck life. Whoever thought concious thought and free will were a good idea was an idiot. We don't even understand how it works but we keep on *thinking*. Go on trying to understand everything else around us when we can't even understand ourselves. Addiction is a disease? a choice? nah, just another part of life. Everyone's addicted to something. Some things just affect us worse when they aren't around.

alright so my family thinks Ive been clean and on methadone for a few months now, but I'm not. Ive been getting high every day. . 
 
sooo anyway, I posted a video on snapchat the other day, and my sister messages me and says ""whys there a mark on ur arm?"" OH SHIT. I FUCKED UP. was my initial reaction. SHIT SHIT SHIT WHAT AM I GONNA DO??? freaking out, I told her that I had burned myself with a cigarette on purpose cuz I was mad. Which is something, mind you, that I am not into. self mutilation is just not my thing. Then she asks for a picture! fuck me in the ass right? so I call my best friend, who does self mutilate, asking her if she happened to have a burn mark already on her arm. unfortunately she didn't, so I'm like ok great what do I do... 

luckily, I had a little burn mark on my leg already (don't know how it got there. maybe I accidentally burned myself when nodding out Idk) so I took a close up picture of that and sent it to her, saying ""there it's close up so u can tell its an actual burn mark and not a hole mark from a needle."" She replied within minutes but my paranoid ass was too afraid to open it. cuz once I open it, she can see that I opened it, and what if she said ""take a far away pic so I can tell that its ur arm"" or something and then I leave her on read and don't answer. then she'd know something's up. so I didn't open her message. (they really oughta change that.) instead, I ignored her all night and all the next day. AND THEN BURNED MYSELF JUST INCASE... then opened up her message. just to see it read ""good."" 

so I burned myself for no reason. the good news is, is that she believed me and I'm still in everyone's good graces. I really love spending time with my family and I would hate if that got ruined. it would sincerely break my heart. Bad news is I'm afraid next time I see her she's gonna ask to see this ""burn mark"" on my arm and then find out it's an actual hole mark from a needle. 

wtf am I gonna do? ignore my family? not see them due to the fear of my little sister seeing marks on my arms and revealing that I am in fact using? fuck man. needle marks are a bitch.  and to top it all off, of course it's fucking summertime and wearing long sleeves is a dead giveaway in itself. 

anyone have any suggestions? Ive tried covering marks up with foundation and concealer but that doesn't really work. I'm now shooting in my hands that way the usual spot (inner arms) doesn't have any marks. I don't think shed think to check my hands (or atleast Id hope so.) like there is really no hiding needle marks is there? -_- ugh come on winter and long sleeves!!!! ",1501998079.0

I put it down to a partially reduced sex-drive due to opiate use, but also my genersl laziness in regards to going out and 'pulling'.

I was at thee pub last night, and this girl, who I've always thought on multiple occasions has been flirting with me, was being very blatant this time round. 

Myself, her, my mate and a couple other locals were sat outside smoking (It was about 2am), and this girl (Let's call her Sil)called me over, asked me for a bump of my coke. I was happy to giver her one, so started pouring coke out on to my phone, and she grabs me, quite tightly, by the upper / inner thigh (Near me Jonathan), and is giving me that sultry look. She's going on about how we always help each other out, have interesting talks n all.

She snorts her bump, hand still on my leg, and is ssking me if she look good etc, then asks me if I'd 'Want to go somewhere n get fucked' (On top meaning go get intoxicated, n I think also meaning, to do the dirty). 

She's a real pretty girl, but I had to decline, 1) Because she was so pissed (But I guess she was the one coming on to me)

2) Because I was staying at a mates house, and the 2 of them had to be up at 4am to drive to airport, the other had work at 7, and the flat was being inspected at 11am.

Thirdly, I wanted to go back and smoke lots of dope, which I wouldn't have been able to do. 

So, how's the sex-life of your single-pringle dope fiends? Do you have much of a sex-drive? Do girls, if they knew you used opiates, would they see this an an unattractive / 'stay away' state?",1501990383.0

Knowing they exist makes life tolerable - I just know if I choose to start buying them (I've gotten them for free so far/found old script bottles) it will very quickly roll into an active pill addiction that will become too expensive and you know the rest.

A lot of you have posted about Kratom, which anyone can apparently pick up at GNC, and its similar effects (weaker though, of course, and also addictive). My first reaction ever reading about kratom was wtf, how is it legal then, must not be good enough hence no profit can be made off addicts. Second, how is it so unknown/unheard of? I have friends who are the know-it-all type, research on everything, and no one outside of this sub seems to be talking about this? So again, my conclusion is it must not be that good. But if someone with low tolerance and limited experience with opiates try it, will it be strong/close enough to an opiate feel?

Ended up with nine screws and two plates in my leg. Shit is painful as fuck. I was only in the hospital for three days. The day I broke it, the following day for surgery, and the next day I checked myself out. (Not AMA, the doctor was ok with it) But, the only reason I checked myself out, is because they were giving me steady dilaudid, fentanyl, morphine and oxycodone, and then once I got moved to the orthopedic floor, the bitch nurse cut my dilaudid (all IV meds) and only gave me 7.5mg percocets. So I said fuck this, I'd be better off at home. Well, the fucking hospital sent me home with 60 5mg oxycodone. It literally lasted me like three days, bc I was prescribed 1-3 pills every 3 hours. Now this is why I believe it was so fucked... I had another major surgery two years prior on the ankle on the same leg. Had less hardware put in, and it didn't seem to hurt as much. I also had insurance back then. This year, I was and still am currently uninsured. When I broke my ankle, it was a way less serious injury, yet the doctor offered me 4mg dilaudud, AND 15mg oxycodone. All because I had insurance, I am sure. This year, I break a way more painful most weight-bearing bone in the body and get a bottle of the weakest oxycodone they make. I have been taking kratom and ibproufen around the clock and am still in a shitload of pain. The shit orthopedic clinic wouldn't give me anything more than worthless ass tramadol. They wanted to refer me to another bullshit clinic which can't even write narcotics scripts, or a pain management place, which I would love to ducking go, if it wasn't $500 for the first visit. Fuck.

I'm back from space/fat/pray the gay away summer camp! And I have 7 days clean!,"A few weeks ago I made a post asking for some advice on how to sneak dope into a summer camp that I was going to and I finally returned. So as it turns out they were no where near as strict on collecting electronics as I thought they were going to be, they only took my phone at night so I didn't really have to worry about being caught. I was going to sneak in 2 grams and then a lil' bit of kratom but my dealer was a dummy and didn't sell me 2 (She made it right though)) so I only ended up having .7 and enough kratom for 2 days. After the first day I realized it wasn't going to last me long enough so rather than conserving my dope as much as possible I figured I'd plow through it in 2 days, have enough kratom for another 2  days and have my pappy mail me some more kratom before I ran out of everything. The kratom didn't last as long as I thought it would and it took the kratom in the mail to arrive a day longer than it was supposed to so I had some minor withdrawals for 2 days. Nothing too terrible bad really, just insomnia which I can't fucking deal with. So as such I've been clean off heroin for 7 days now! To celebrate I went out and got me a g, and I was going to get some coke too but my dealer couldn't get it for another day or 2 so I'm going to have to wait a couple days before I can do speed balls :(.

The reasoning was that once opiates hit the brain, the receptors get filled, and any added opiates don't hit the receptors as well/hard. So if you're going to swallow oxy/smoke BTH/shoot opiates, you should do the maximum amount all at one time instead of doing something like half now half later, because the second half wont be as strong as if you took it altogether.

Long story short - I've attempted quitting norcos about 5 times cold turkey to no avail. This time I'm over a week in with no pills, I know it seems pale in comparison to the success stories I've read on here. I've been supplementing with kratom, l-theanine, and mood up stress down, and trying to get in exercise - but my body feels a hot fucking mess in terms of muscle aches and migraines. like 8/10 on a pain scale. 

Problem is - they were like that BEFORE said addiction, which is what led me to pills in the first place. Now my monthly doc visit is in two days, and this is what I fear. I'm worried I'll just get overstimulated by everything there (much like us ladies do when we go with a friend to a salon, we say ""oh I'll just get a haircut too!"") for a weak example anyway.... Or I'll let the doc tell me I do need them and just give in and take the script. 

So I suppose it boils down to - Even though I'm trying to stay completely off these things, I'm wondering if I should grab one more prescription and have a bottle on hand for ""emergency"" days or those days when I have to get as shit ton done but I can't because of a crippling migraine. I've also been on stadol before for migraines, and that just led to norcos. So I'm thinking maybe ask for that instead?

Then when you are desperate, you can get a wash out of these cottons and save yourself from illness for a little longer. Some people claim to get a real decent hit if they have used a lot of good dope.. 

So, here in the UK, when we go into 95% of all pharmacies and ask for a 'pack', no questions asked they reach under the counter and give to an awesome brown paper bag wrap of goodies. Spoons, ascorbic acid for dissolving , 20 X 1m needles (any size available on request) and alcohol sanitary wipes AND... with each spoon, a filter that is basically a rolling tobacco filter tip.


Does anyone want me to do a no-faces totally anonymous video of picking up a pack in the UK, so you know what to do in the interest of harm reduction?

Anyway - my actual question. Does anyone from England actually really use their filters? I ask because it just seems like the dope isn't good enough here (that I know of, anywhere) that you would get barely a tickle from a bunch of filters. 

Three x '£10 bags' at once makes a person feel itchy for about 1 minute, then no euphoria, just wellness. Until symptoms of withdrawal kick in 12 hour later. 10 dealers in one city, a different colours and textures, same result. Makes .e think it's me with the problem.

I was in the hospital today to get my head and chest x-rayed as I apparently blacked out around 8PM last night and fell and hit my head several times. One time caused a nice gash on my forehead and now theres blood all over the floor and walls in my house. Anyways it took two emergency room nurses over 5 minutes (one on each arm) to find a single shitty vein to draw blood from which of course blew the vein but I told he to keep going she's not going to find a better one. 

If they don't think I used to bang from just that they probably do now when I asked ""What gauge needle is that 23?"" Which is when she looked up at me with a puzzled face and said ""ummm yea how did you know"" to which I responded ""just had a feeling."" 

So yea pics soon to come of the gash on my forehead and my left ear which is so bruised it's black. I feel like I've been in a car accident. 

Moral of the story don't slam 8 beers then think ""Oh I'm totally fine might as well take like 10mg of benzos"" seriously don't do it. This is the first time I've ever blacked out no matter how drunk I've gotten (I'm talking like 2 handles of whiskey and still knew what was going on, I mean I couldn't move but still) so now I know how scary it is when people say they've had that happen.

Oh and I created and run the IRC chat, but that's neither here nor there. Several years ago, in my late 20's I made the usual progression, sorta. Some friends turned me on to 30mg morphine, I'd done vikes for wisdom teeth surgery and friends but never really got down until then -- so anywho, I got oxies and was lucky enough to do some opana stop signs before those dried up and eventually heroin. I'm trying to keep this short but also some back story.

Dope got too crazy and expensive, I work full time in an office. I used subs here and there to save money but just got hooked on subs and was in for a RUDE awakening when I stopped Roxie's and subs cold turkey after a couple months of regular use. 5 weeks of absolute hell and I gave up and got back on the black. 

Again, it was too much to be blowing $60+ a day, back to subs. I know /r/kratom and/or opiatesrecovery may be better but I was hoping for success stories or tips from y'all.

Kratom is great, but bupe is very strong and even though I'm down to less than 2mg/day, .5-.75 snorted twice a day, I have to be slightly functional for work. Going down in dose from here is tough, due to the epic half life of bupe I feel like whatever opiate I do during the month or so of detox won't matter. If I could find/afford hydro or oxy for a month I would. Should I just load up on vitamins and kratom and wolf down 6g 3-4x a day for a month until this horrible, soul sucking joy vampire drug is mostly gone and white knuckle through PAWS. Anyone done bupe for a while (I'm a bit over a year now) and got off with kratom? Thanks.

But I had to share this story.  I had just copped earlier around 5pm and did my shot.  As I was walking home, I see this asshole teen beating this small, defenseless puppy.

I just did a nickel upstate in the pen, so I couldn't go with my gut and just give this fucker a right hook.  I'm watching him beat this dog mercilessly and I had to do something, but again, I'm on parole.

So I walked over, pushed him out of the way and just scooped up the puppy.  I brought her home and now she's laying in bed with me. I feel like a softy, but I had a hard life and was beat regularly too.  Now she is mine.

The asshole kid was yelling at me like 'wtf u doing nigga'.  I didn't say one word, just grabbed her and walked away.  I guess technically I violated parole and stole the dog, but fuck it, whatever.  Now I just hope I don't get called in for a piss test, lol.

On a sidenote, I know homies friend just died, and that majorly sucks. I truly do feel for the dude.

6s3pnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6s3pnd/fuck_this_fent_shit/,4,https://redd.it/6s3pnd,imathrowaway386,Fuck this fent shit.,"So this is a throwaway, as my current gf knows my reddit username and im pretty sure she keeps tabs of what im doing, and she would freak out if she knew we (she) did fent.

So i moved back to my home county 6 months ago. Got in contact with my some family that i had a falling out with and havent talked to in years...and most of them are on heroin now. When i left here nobody did heroin. Everyone for the most part just stuck to blues. I moved to another county in the state, and you couldnt find heroin there. It was all blues/dilaudid unless you drove 45 minutes to the 2 nearest metro areas.

So after i moved here with my girl, i get ahold of my brother, and he is fucked. Smoking crack, shooting heroin and dilaudid and his gf is a prostitute and he steals shit from stores and sells it. He was getting me blues semi regularly, but about a month ago he gets arrested. Already on bond, so now he has no bond. At work i find a guy that literally pulled out his debit card to pay for his drink and percocet falls out - so i get his number.

After about 2 weeks of him saying he cant get anything, he finally comes through with oxy 5's. Sucks because its a shitload of powder to snort. In the mean time, my stepdad who used to weigh 300lbs and now looks like skeletor because of heroin, was able to get blues around the first of the month from his ex-80-something year old gf (he is in his 50's btw). So that tides me over. 2 days ago nobody can get anything. So i start lope. Except its not really working. Today i say fuck and hit them both up. No answer from stepdad. Dude says he can get Codeine 30's for $10 (""its a good deal bro!"" - wtf, was i fucking born yesterday?). Finally a few hours later, he says he can blues. About 30 minutes later he said he got the A-215's and hes on the way.

Now this is the first time he got blues for me. He even mentioned it last time we met. He was supposed to get me 3. He gives me 2 and half and says he owes me. He will get me a 15 and 5 tomorrow. *Okay fine.*

I take the half and crush it up. *It burns*. Not good. Few minutes later, i notice it *doesnt have that oxy drip taste*. Then about 15 minutes later, im not sick anymore, but the euphoric, energy i usually get from blues is non-existant. Also, my gf who is pretty niave when it comes to drugs besides weed, said it burned and it barely did anything - and i didnt mention anything to her about it.

Besides that, ive been doing blues for years. So you get used to little things like the way they snap when you snap them in half, and the look of the pill. Both of these had red flags.

I texted him and his response was ""Nobody else said anything.""

Dude is 10 years younger that me and probably doesnt even know it. Maybe he does. I dont really care. I have a package of real ones coming from -REDACTED- tomorrow, so ill be fine. I just needed to vent.",1502085565.0

Ive been on subs since may and went on a run for a few days at the end of june. I didnt take any subs for two days before i started it and had been taking 4mgs every other day for about 3 weeks before that. When i went on my run, i didnt get high for 3 days (mostly smoking, banged a little bit too on the last day out of frustration, went through about a g total). I just didnt wanna od or push anything too far, but by the end of the run i hadnt taken any subs in 5 days and didnt catch a buzz.

 
Part of it is that i think it was just some weak h, but its also got me thinking. How much will my tolearance be up from taking subs? I know the bupe blocks opiate receptors for a while but i thought id get at least a little high.
 

What does r/opiates think? Im picking up tomorrow and by the time i do itll be 72hrs since my last 4mg sub. I just wanna have an idea of if i have an opiate tolearance, and thats preventing me from getting high or if its my receptors being blocked.

Long semi-oily hair, skinny as a rail and unreliable as fuck. I woke up in the morning to sweat-soaked shits and kicking legs, and immediately checked my phone. Did I already have a message? Yeah, probably. Dan: “hey get ur ass up”. I was the money man. I was the middle class kid who always figured out a scheme or a scam to get the hundreds of dollars a day we needed. They were simply the middlemen. I take a bite of my strawberry cereal bar, the whole 100 calories it was in its entirety. I gag at the taste, even though I used to eat these like candy. I’m already sick as fuck but also constipated at the same time. Don’t ask, I never got the shits until around day 3 of withdrawal… If I'm lucky I'm alone and can walk out of my house unbothered. Otherwise, my parents were standing right there, like the army lieutenant from Full Metal Jacket (or that’s is how I saw them for the past few months). “Oh hey mom… I'm going out for a bike ride.” She shakes her head. There towards the end she didn’t even have the words to say to me anymore. My heart broke more and more each day. 

I rolled on out the blacktop driveway as I made a stop in the bushes right across from our old wooden fence dividing the property line. I quickly but calmly grab my rig (short tip, long tip or any size. Hell, even bent. My longest running was nicknamed “Coffin Nail”) from a random spot in the bushes I had thrown it the previous night. Could *not* be bringing that onto my property with the way my parents are. I continue walking out this little country backroad as I’m staring at my phone waiting for the call from Dan or Dillon that they are pulling onto my street. I listen to Burrough’s Junky on audiotape from youtube (and about how his maid said opium brought sweet dreams. That sounds better than the oxymorphone nightmares), and suddenly the phone rings. it is them. “Hey man get to the graveyard to meet us quick, Dillon has a credit card we can use to turn into cash. You can figure out how, right?”. Oh fuck.. How am I gonna do this? Of course I would figure it out but OF COURSE I can’t rightly say how either. Nonetheless, one could likely wonder how I ended up in this position, so let’s get back to that for a second.


[drug den behind the bank, 8PM June or April(?)]

It was a calm day in April as I stood within a small 5x10 laundry room with bleach, appliances and every single thing you would need to shoot up some little rubber pills. I wondered to myself… “there’s no way you can IV these things. I’ve seen the threads on bluelight. This will fucking kill you”. I kept thinking and realized I ultimately didn’t care. It was just once, right? I wanted to feel that rush, damnit! I was just a young drug aficionado who wanted to push that limit time after time. Dillon has this stupid fucking smirk painted upon his face and nothing could change it. He was filled with glee regarding the damage I was about to instill upon myself. It was actually quite morbid now that I think about it. Dan on the other hand had the blankest expression I have ever seen. If I were not a man of logic and reason I would tell you that his eyes were pitch black that day. That is how they looked anyhow.

He reached for the fresh pack of insulin syringes in the cupboard above and tells Dillon to fetch some warm water from the kitchen. “Make sure it’s fucking warm this time!”, Dan insists. I watch him carefully dip the pill, wipe the coating on his worn, old red long sleeves and stick a quarter of a yellow E series opana 40mg onto an aluminum foil tray he made. He turns on a nearby toaster (the fuck is that doing here?) and begins to let it warm up. “Oh.. you have to cook these by the way”, he just now tells me. I knew it would be a rough process but not this rough. Okay, I’ll survive. They have so far, right?

Before I know it, the pill is mixed atop a coca cola can (bottom side up) into the gross, black and brown amalgamation which was thicker than the sweetest honey this side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I see Dan bite off the end of a cig filter (sweet, more lack of sterility for me to cringe at. Ah.. how things would soon change) and throw it into the mix. He begins to draw up this honey into the orange tipped insulin syringe. “Hold out your arm”, he says. I hold up my arm, shaking all over from nerves. How would it feel, I wonder. He says I will feel a poke just as the doctors say. I feel it, but it isn’t bad. I kinda liked it already. I now actually turn my head towards him to watch how he does it. I’m not squeamish anymore. I noticed the little tiny sea of red blood rush into the brown moat of oxymorphone solution. Uh oh… this is it. “I’m in..”, says Dan. I watch as he slowly but steadily pushes down the plunger, and I’m already feeling it…

It begins in my forehead, like an exotic kiss from the ghost of all my past loves combined. It was so warm and inviting, so quick and powerful. So natural, so real and delightful. It felt like meshing souls with the gods (or demons). I felt my body go completely numb with euphoria and I was sitting on flowers. I was wrapped so tightly in the opiate blanket I couldn't move much at all. I was back in the womb again, but it looks like the forest from Alice in Wonderland. Everything has a feint glow to it. Colors are much more vibrant. Everything is now soft to the touch, no pain or discomfort could see its way through this chemical Wall of China. I remained blissfully trapped in this little wooden kitchen chair, in the back of some old ladies home, a legit drug den. All my anxieties and all my fears, all my hesitation about the thoughts of my peers and family,  were all gone now. I look up with glossy eyes and a similar shit-eating smirk as Dillon had earlier. “How is it”, they both say in unison. I muttered out, “pretty fucking amazing. Everything I thought it would be and more...” This is it, I knew already in the back of mind. This is how I want to feel forever. 

I didn’t hang around long. Even while high as a fucking kite, I knew I had to get out of this bed bug infested home. My mom and I would both freak if we got them. I gave my appreciation as everyone’s mouth dropped that I was capable of getting up at all, let alone ride my bike home. This became a common theme with myself and my drug addict friends. They were always amazed at my natural inclination to “handle my shit”. Maybe it was simply a natural tolerance. I’m not quite sure still but it applied to all types of drugs. I floated down the brick steps under the glass sliding door connect this den to the outside world. We would usually sneak in this way as to not bother the actual tenant of the home. She was chill with all us junkies hanging around apparently. She just knew we would be dead or in jail otherwise I guess. I hop on my 250$ mountain bike that is supposed to be shared with my mom. She never uses it though. It has become my daily driver for my drug missions. It really sucks in a town with not enough sidewalks, and drunk/high rednecks swerving all over the pothole infested and cracked road. 

I did not even care tonight. I couldn’t see well, but my instinct was guiding me home. Home was my happy place, and on my peaceful bed I would always meditate. (Ever gone into a meditative state while high on IV opiates? It is bliss and even better than just the typical nod. I told myself I was repairing all the damage I had done to my brain. Ha, yeah…)

I glide down the sidewalk beside the bank at warp speed but to me it feels like slow motion. My pupils were pinned and my eyelids were so heavy I can barely keep them open long enough to see I’m on the pavement. I continue downhill past the funeral homes, dollar stores, prostitutes and pharmacies which now dominate this small town. I pass the government living buildings in downtown, which I normally don’t like biking past due to sketchiness of the road *and* the people. However, on this night, bring it on. I was one of them now. They all loved me. Just show them your fresh track marks! Shit is like a badge now. I was feeling all chill about it on the ride home, and for the rest of the night as I crawled up in bed after meditation and threw on some adventure time. 

I remember shutting off all my lights and barely cracking my door, implying I’m asleep. No way I wanted to deal with my parents now. I doze in and out for a few hours in a blissful haze similar to the time I sniffed some heroin but a lot stronger. There was literally no way for me to stay awake long like this. The pull of my bed’s comfort was in its prime state. A state only achieved with chemical influence. I go to bed for a presumably dreamless night, but if I did dream it was probably already about shooting up. 

In the morning I awoke, and everything was normal for a brief moment. I look around and stretch, when I see it. A big nasty bruise and red puffy lump on the crook of my left arm from the needle’s bite. I feel an extremely intense feeling of disgust wash over me like all the litter in the ocean just came and I bathed in it. 

I felt like scum, and I was never gonna do that again…

I've been browsing this for the past couple of days, and first of all thank you to the multitude of ppl out there who are willing to share your knowledge with those of us who aren't as savvy.  I am brand new to the site in general (as if my greeting wasn't a dead giveaway), and really see immense value in something like this, as I constantly Google stuff re: opiates only to uncover shotty information at best, which I don't see a lot of on here and if so, it is quickly snuffed out and corrected...so here goes...

My use has developed into kind of a one week on/one week off type of thing.  

I usually re-up on payday with approximately 50 or so Perk 30s which lasts me 5-7 days, then I wait roughly 48 hours after my last dosage (which I sniff) when I start feeling withdrawal symptoms badly to begin taking 4mg of Subs every 12 hours or so to keep the withdrawal monster away, and then I stop taking the Subs roughly 48-72 hours before payday rolls around so I can then re-up, rinse and repeat.

Does this sound like a decent plan in the respect of making sure that I'm not wasting my re-up by using opiates again too soon?  I know that I definitely feel jammed up after the 2-3 days off of Subs, but I realize that could be mind over matter and I'm basically tricking myself into believing that I'm as high as I would be even if I chose not to take the Subs at all.  

Would I be better off taking even more days off in between Subs & Perks, taking the Subs at a lower dosage and/or frequency, or is the way I've been doing it okay?  I would like to ensure that I'm not messing around with my tolerance level too much and getting the best value possible and the most bang for my buck (pun intended).  

I'm all ears.  Thanks again.",1502063553.0

Yesterday another friend and sibling of a friend were waiting on a dboy. As typical the dboy wasn't committing to a precise time, which is still better than saying 20 minutes and making us wait an hour. In our case he had a real, ""I'll get to you when I get to you"" type of attitude.

&nbsp;

While waiting for the dboy, one of my friend's other siblings was asked if she had a connect. Sibling A usually doesn't go through sibling B because it would just make them more annoying. Sibling B also has a big mouth, and then you have the so called ""grape vine"".

&nbsp;

One time I walked into a friend while shopping and they said, ""I heard you did acid"" with a negative connotation in their tone. Of course I ask, ""where'd you hear that?"" To which he responds, ""the grapevine."" Fuck you and your motherfucking grapevine nigga. It's not like I'm gonna go on a murderous rampage, or vandalize something for for talking among friends. It puts me within inches of writing off a friend when they give me such a dumb ass response unless they've already built up a lot of good will that outweighs such a betrayal. 

&nbsp;

During a routine phone call my good friend plainly dropped the question as to whether I did H. Fuck, wonder why he'd suspect that? I didn't ask him why he suspected that because I'm not gonna put him on the spot if he has sources he can't reveal. On top of that, I'm not going to insult his deductive reasoning skills.

Bored today, went to play some keno at the smoke shop. Play 10 games, 3 numbers with a multiplier. Watched my 10 games, two of them the first number that came up was one of mine (I play 24, 33, 71), one game that was my only number. The other one I hit two on a 3x multiplier. So im gonna go get my $7.50 and buy a few scratch-offs then head home. The line was a half mile long so I decide to go out and smoke a cigarette and wait for it to die down. 

I head back and go right to the counter, hand him my ticket and he scans it. I pick out my single $5 and $2 ticket, he rings it up, the drawer pops to hand me my fifty cents and he hands me $100.50. I thought he made a crazy error but I look at the machine and it says ""Customer Wins: $107.50"" I glance back at the keno screen and there it is on the game that just ended, 24, 33, and 71. Turns out the first game I watched I guess I didn't buy in time to be on it, so that last game I was in for. 

The best part is some *cosmic* shit that made that line long so I waited because otherwise I would have just gotten my $7.50, left and not me nor the cashier would have ever known and that 100 bucks would have been in the trash for no one to enjoy.

Guess im getting some coke to hangout with my dope tonight. Not that I couldnt have afforded it anyways but it's more justifiable this way. 

Other thoughts:

1) Why do we always win money when we have money. My lady just got paid $1,400 yesterday and we've probably bought 4-$5 tickets plus this keno since then. Won $50 on the first ticket, bought 3 more and hit $100 on one of those. If we only had a few bucks we would never hit anything. 

2) Anyone else feel like this sub is more hostile than normal today? Not sure why the anger. Its a beautiful mid summer saturday! Birds are a chirpin, rigs are a registerin, cigarettes a smokin.

I am curious whether the same chemicals and process can be used to convert #4 to #3. In other words would some water, baking soda, and heat do the trick?

My only other option was to try to find a site to guest at but i was informed that insurance usually doesn't apply and it would cost me about $100 for the 2 days.

As I'll only be missing 2 days they basically said as long as I make every day after i won't be in any trouble or face any repercussions. But the counselor was also more or less hinting at the fact that unless i want to feel like shit, I'll probably have to use and they don't kick you out if you relapse. In fact, she basically told me to just be careful and resume the program when i get back.

So... What should I do? I can already feel shitty withdrawal symptoms start to set in at night and in the morning when the subs have worn off.

But they also had a ton of these:

RETAIL THEFT

By the nature of the game the law is very hard to avoid, no joke. But this was the first charge on so many of my friends records. Retail theft, drug and paraphernalia. Now they're stuck on probation, in jail, all basically cycling through. They can't stay clean and some of them still steal.

I was just thinking though, if I could tell someone using dope one thing, it would be when you're out of money, ask for help. Easier said than done but getting stuck in the legal system makes recovery SO much harder when you can get extra time for every relapse. It traps you

I'm not trying to preach, it was just a thought because I think at some point money becomes a problem for most junk users. I can't tell you not to steal but it's such an easy way to get caught and even stopping for a little bit would help you a lot..

My scripts never last so i finally found a plug for oxy. Expensive af but hey i was only going to buy a few 20s/40s a week to supplement my script. Now it's like a month later, I'm taking 100-140mg of oxy a day at work on top of tea when my script is for 40mg a day. Like I'm fkn spiralling here fam. Working 10-20- hours a week of OT on top of the 60 or something hours i was already doing to justify my spending so much on pills. But then I'm at work so long i need even more oxy to keep energetic and not throw myself off the roof mid shift. Vicious cycle to say the least.

It's just getting ridiculous, I'm simultaneously contemplating trying heroin though that's just as expensive here, killing myself or trying to get clean. I just fkn wish i wasn't in crippling pain 24/7 it makes living without painkillers so challening but at the same time i miss life. I miss chasing women, playing sport, being able to have fun with friends without constantly wanting to leave to do pills. On top of all this shit i barely get to a fkn nod anymore. 2 months ago i was plugging 30mg of morphine on top of tea with maybe 5-10mg of oxy on the side and nodding hard. Now i take 140mg in a day and I'm not close to a nod. Fk this life, I'm so fkn trapped. Brb gotta go spend another $250 on a few days worth of pills.😐 ",1502190432.0

So everything is as it should be, but the blister pack is off.. to me.

So even though the pack is identical to regular, I will never know if it's real, but if the blister pack is weird then I know for sure it's well made fakes and take caution, but continue to use. At least I'd know that they are fake.

CAS: 101365-54-2   
Molecular formula: C22H28N2O2   
[Structural formula](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/2-methoxy-N-(1-phenethylpiperidin-4-yl\)-N-phenylacetamide.png)  

Water solubility: saturation point of the HCl salt at 25C is >12mg/mL  

Among the fentanyl derivatives with a history of recreational use, this compound is most structurally similar to [acetylfentanyl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Acetylfentanyl.svg/1200px-Acetylfentanyl.svg.png)  

**Dosage guidelines**  

Potency is similar to fentanyl and with no tolerance I felt threshold warm and fuzzy effects at 1.5ug/kg IR. Strong effects were felt at 9ug/kg IR.  

**Duration**  

3-4 hours IR  

**Subjective feels**  

I've sampled a few fentanyl derivatives and can't determine any unique effects. IMO the variance in this class is only in potency and duration.   

Initial rectal administration of MAF produces a warm, dulling sensation which spreads through and around the body. After a few minutes the full body is vibrating comfortably with constricted pupils and the mind is relaxed, a little foggy.

Not fine dining but emulated it and a step up from most chain places. Pat was a co worker of mine. He was friendly n goofy and he quickly became a friend and one of those people that just makes your night at work better.

We went out for drinks here and there. Talked about music, life, work, anything. He learned of my past and i learned of his. Like me, he had some addiction issues here and there but seemed like he was back in a good place.

A few months into working, i could see signs of regression in him. I respected him and his choices, didn't ask questions, just let him be. I treated him how i always had and he was the same with me. He lost his job shortly after but i tried to maintain contact with him. We didn't talk much, and honestly i was nervous to interact with him. I was still not far removed from heroin and i didn't wanna jeopardize my situation. He texted me once in May and once in June. Nothing that seemed important but i didn't reply to either. I was still scared.

Tonight, my manager told me that Pat over dosed this weekend and died. He was young. He was a great guy who was warm and genuine. 

I'm sorry that i wasn't a better friend. I'm sorry that i didn't offer help when you needed it. I'm sorry i didn't respond to you and that this is how you died.

•There are some light blues that look like they have been sucked, as in they fall apart, the imprint is barely visible if at all, and they break into powder as soon as you try to break them. 
•There are other light blue ones that are smaller than normal, they have the same diameter but are very short. 
•There are dark blue ones that have darker spots throughout them and are very hard to break up. 
I'm not sure if they are fent, but orally they have no effect whatsoever. I do these on a daily basis and have for quite sometime where as they are so strong and it would cost an insane amount of money to use anything because It would take 120 mg hydrocodone to feel anything. I started with a habit of 6-7 tabs twice a day and in the beginning it took a quarter of one snorting to feel the effects similar to 6-7  10 mg tabs. A friend of mine said they were very strong shooting them and plugging they are less potent than snorting. They may not be fent, but they are definitely not oxycodone and are very, very strong. 
These will bring a nice high, but be careful guys! Stay safe and happy nods!

I shot up in the inner vein that is right below the Back of my knee last night. It registered the whole time and blood was flowing in with no pain, but afterward it appeared to still somehow be a missed shot. (Numb, slightly swollen, high came on gradually). Now it is a day later and I can barely straighten out my leg and can barley walk, I'm limping around at the moment. The pain has gotten worse as the day has gone by but I'm also working an 8 hour shift on my feet at the moment. Besides being a little bruised like leg shots usually get, the area is not red, just a tiny bit tender and swollen but nothing noticeable. The pain seems to be deeper in my leg if that makes sense. Any idea what this could be? Is it just from the miss and will go away in a day or could it signify something worse? No signs of cellulitis buy the feeling is somewhat comparable. I'm just concerned that if the pain keeps getting worse that tomorrow I might not even be able to walk. 


EDIT: So I went to the doctor today and it turned out to be cellulitis. Had spread to my arm when I woke up so that's what I was thinking. Moral of the story is shooting below the waist = bad.

I have such a powerful fucking urge to get a 2 more and cut them in half and use it as an evening treat this week before finally stopping. What do you think?

The dude and I had a falling out, so I switched back to kratom for a few months, found a plug for xans, my plug ended up getting me green 15 oxys for 7 a piece then I quit for a month and found new plug for oxy which I've been getting for a couple of months.",1502130910.0

Anyway, two hours ago I was walking out of a Publix with my toasted Italian on white with provolone, lettuce, extra onions and jalapenos with a bag of kettle cooked Jalapeno chips (I like it spicy son) when I noticed a retiree dragging a 3 week old bunny, a 2 month old puppy and a kitten behind her golf cart. Now just having been released from doing a ""nick"" ""down the road"" at a ""pen"" I was like ""nah cracka, fuck dat shit"" but I didn't wanna go back to ""the joint"" for stopping this 90 year old animal murderer from turning these creatures into puddles of blood. Eventually, even though I'm a recovering user and grimy ass junkie with over a decade of trifling behavior in my past, I decided I had to act. So I hit the 90 year old with a Rock Bottom. About this time her husband came out of Publix with some zipties and a roll of duct tape (presumably to kidnap and torture more innocent creatures) and he fixed his face like he wanted some static too. So, like Burger King, he can have it his way. He ran up to check the vitals on his animal torturing cohort who was still recovering from the textbook Rock Bottom I administered when I raised my right eyebrow, and delivered the most [brutal yet effective combination of slaps](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ETVChmu2eaw) ever. He's on the ground writhing in pain and moaning like a bitch, the bunny, puppy and kitten are all chanting my name, I remove the elbow pad that I was wearing at Publix for some reason and [administer some junkie justice](https://youtu.be/iDTyVipw3DQ) to these fuckin jabronis.  One of the cart attendants informed me thst ""he was broken in half"" and that they ""had a family"" as if that matters to a cold hearted junkie with a soul of gold  (like me).

I have been taking percocets 7.5mg about once a day for about a 6 months now (only with a period of about 2 weeks off and 2 weeks on.) However, this last month I didn't have any days off, so I started to become more tolerant to the drug (I guess), and I am having to take more to feel anything. Well yesterday, I took 3 (30 mins apart), and didn't feel that high that I typically feel when taking them. Today, I took 4 within about 1 hour of each other. I didn't feel high at all, that is, until about 4 hours later, a time when the drug should be wearing off, I am starting to feel like I'm wanting to nod off, only I won't allow myself bc my adrenaline kicks in when I do. The more time passes the more subdued I feel, my chest and upper stomach feels a little tight (my blood pressure is normal, 127/79 and my heart rate is good too, 70), and I could sleep if I wanted to, very easily. This has never happened to me before, and it's freaking me out a bit to be honest.

Of course, for anyone with any tolerance, 200mcg administered buccally, gradually over 25 minutes, is not nearly enough to get a buzz. Two at a time isn't either. Plus they're a pain in the ass to administer - you have to actively rub them around and avoid swallowing, and they tear up your gums. I'm aware of the baking soda trick - this only serves to make it more unpleasant in my experience.

Is there any way to hack these? Better yet, extract the fent? What immediately comes to mind is plugging, but I'm not sure what the bioavailability is from that ROA. Of course I can try (-_-). Dissolving them into a small volume of liquid and using nasally doesn't sound particularly pleasant, too much material up there. Any ideas/experience?

I've gone from 16-8before but this was when I was only on 16 for a couple weeks max. I felt more cravings but no sickness. Now I've been on 16 for at least two months.

I have never gotten to the point of regular use of opiates, or even close to regular use - I've been a very infrequent chipper, once or twice a year at most, but I really do love opiates, more than anything, so for me it would only be a matter of time, as in if I found reliable access to them I would tumble down that road for sure. 

Decided to try Kratom, and share my personal experience on in case there are other people out there who are recovering addicts or know they could easily become addicts like myself.
 
Instead of ordering it online though, I actually decided to buy from a local store - I live in the pacific NW, I know everyone said it's best to get it online but there are plenty of legal herb/weed shops around here that I felt more comfortable just buying it there first. Sure, it's more expensive, but I'd rather not put my credit card and information on a Kratom vendor website...maybe I'm overly cautious (and snobby).  

Got a red strain (mangae? spelling) after a bit of online research that suggested those are the most euphoric-like, resembling opiates' effects. It cost $14/ounce, yes I realize that's a whole lot more than the deals I can find online, but don't worry, when/if I become a regular consumer I will make sure I get a better deal. Seriously though, spare the $money comments, I'm fine with the rip-off, my wallet can take the hit.   

Anyhoos, had my first tea yesterday, put a full teaspoon (so about 2-3 grams, don't have a scale unfortunately) and I really liked it! The taste wasn't great, but the effect was pretty darn close to opiates!! Like I said, I wasn't really looking to be high as a kite and/or close to nodding, when I take opiates, I usually just want the enhanced mood, motivation to be active and do things, to be more social and energized with people, etc...and that's exactly what I got!!  I don't know about people who are trying to quit H or painkillers and how much they would feel from it since their tolerance might be too high for Kratom to work, but for all you people who have been chipping or close to forming a habit/addiction (I would include myself in this category), I strongly recommend it!!

6sfvst,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6sfvst/story_of_my_first_withdrawal/,2,https://redd.it/6sfvst,heroinAM,Story of my first withdrawal,"Wanna make this short and sweet. I was 15 and loving with my grandparents bc both my parents were opiate addicts and in jail. Drank pretty often bc my grandparents literaly had hundreds of bottles of wine and liquor they never even looked at. Eventually, I wanted something more, and I knew that something had to be opiates; if my parents were willing to die for that shit, it had to be good. My great grandma also lived with us, and she was perscribed a metric fuckton of meds. After she died, she left behind about 100 4mg dillies and at least 120 of oxy 10's, along with some old hydros and morphine my grandparents had leftover from a surgery. I had honestly been waiting for my opprotunity to give them a try. I didn't intend to use them frequently, but we know how that goes. Popped two oxy tens at school for my first time, and I'll never forget that feeling of warmth crawling up my spine; it was the warm hug I had never felt. I had never been so happy, social, and empathetic in my life. I decided I always wanted to feel this way. See, when you're high on opiates (as many of you know), being an opiate addict doesn't sound like an awful idea. Anyway, I started using every day right away and once a day, snorting and swallowing, with enough pills to last me about a month and a half if not more. Now, I knew that withdrawal was a thing, but for some reason I felt like I was immune from it. By the time I ran out, my tolerance was maybe at 40 mg of oxy to feel good. I had gone a day or two without using before and had been fine, so I wasn't too worried about running out. Anyway, I started having flu symptoms, and honestly thought it was just a coincidence, until the second night; 36 hours in. I was feeling bad, but for some reason, withdrawal was a lot easier before I knew a line of hydromorphone was the cure I needed. That night, after I finally managed to sleep, I had a crazy vivid and long dream in which I was a Confederate civil war soldier; starting with me being in a fight with my wife about enlisting, going to war, and eventually being in a battle. It was really intense, I remember the stress vividly. Suddenly, I was shot in the stomach, and it hurt. Badly. I could fucking feel the pain, and I sat there in the dream, bleeding out in agony; I couldn't wake up. Eventually, one of my fellow soldiers carried me off and took me to a medical camp, where they were preparing to give me a morphine pill. That's when I woke up, but the pain was still there in my stomach and legs, and I had to throw up. It wasn't just like ""oh shit, I feel like I'm gunna puke""; I HAD to throw up. I jumped out of bed and tried running down the hall to the bathroom, but puked all over the carpet instead. I eventually made it to the bathroom where I passed a huge fucking baseball of a turd, followed by the first diharea of that kind I had ever felt for the rest of the night. Wasn't able to find a plug for any pills for at least two months, but would still steal from my friends grandma (worst thing I've ever done honestly) and convince kids who got injuries or surgeries to give me theirs. six months later I'm shooting heroin, and the rest is history.",1502220502.0

So we hop in my  santa fe and head towards the city. about ten minutes into the drive a younger kid named fred calls me ""bro please take me to the city"". I tell him No way. already on my way, not turning around. I can hear the desperation in his voice when he blurts out ""I will give you $500 for a ride to the city right now"". bet. be outfront in five minutes. 

So i pull up to his house, he gets in and we start the half hour drive. ""wheres this $500 dude?"" ""...........listen bro i dont have it yet im getting it in the city"" (Not the answer i was hoping for but this kid is an idiot so it was to be expected) I told him he's a scumbag for wasting my time and promising me money that he's never gonna get, and if he thinks hes gonna get his get well off of the tiny amount that Nick and I are about to get than hes out of his mind. Then i ask the question ""So whats the plan here fred how are you getting this money?""

Fred explains the plan. Someone from his hometown(2 hours away) is looking for a pound of loud. He's meeting us in the city. and fred is just gonna take this kids money. Nick and I think its hilarious. ""There is no way that's gonna work, your retarted. Who would just give up their money and let it walk?"" So at this point i know I'm not seeing a dollar from this kid but i figure this whole scenario is pure entertainment. I think the best case scenario is that I get to watch Fred and the victim fight. 

We pull up to the meeting spot, I call the plug and start the ""5 minute"" wait. Fred hops out to go rob this kid 1 BLOCK OVER from where we are copping. ""If he doesnt wanna give up the money I'm just gonna kick his ass"" Nick and I laugh ""Yeah, okay fred sounds good, kick his ass."" Right when Fred dissapears around the corner the dopeman pulls up and Nick and I get well. And we wait.... and we wait some more, no sign of fred. Nick calls him. I call him. No answer. Nick and I start discussing the possibility that Fred either got his ass kicked or got arrested for trying to rob this kid in broad daylight. ""Fuck this, I'm leaving. Fred can find his own ride home."" So i start to pull off, at this exact moment Fred turns the corner, with the vic right next to him. The vic, as it turns out, is probably 6'2 180ish pounds. Tatted the fuck up, throat, neck, face, all that. The kid is a straight goon. ""Absolutely unreal! THAT""S the kid he was gonna rob? do you see this right now dude"" Nick stays silent. 

I'm driving down the street(One Way) Fred and the vic are about 15 yards in front of us, on the sidewalk to my left, walking in our direction. My plan is just to nope tf outta there and let fred deal with this dumb situation that i wanted no parts of from the beginning. Right when im about to pass them, Fred makes his move. Sprints to my car and dives in the backseat. ""GOGOGOGOGO"" i lock the door. drive maybe ten feet, and a god damn fed ex truck is stopped blocking the entire street. I look to my left. The vic is running up to my door, starts punching the fuck out of my window. And im just stuck there, waiting for my window to shatter. After the longest ten seconds of my life, the fed ex truck starts moving. SKIRRRRTTTTT. i bust a left, then a right. We're free. ""fred what the fuck was that, you're such a moron! I knew this wouldnt work!"" I turn around.....Still to this day i cant believe what i saw. Fred has a backpack. Holy Shit, the little fucker actually got the money! he unzips it, the backpack is STUFFED with cash. ""HOLY FUCK DUDE HOW MUCH MONEY IS THAT"" Fred just smiles, but he's shaking. We're all jacked up on adrenaline. He  hands me five thousand dollars, gives nick $2500. I call my dude. ""PAPI!!!! i need 30 bundles. okay. see you in twenty minutes."" i park up and Fred starts counting the money. $32,000. THIRTY.TWO. THOUSAND.

(I need to preface this next part by saying Fred was not my friend. he was a young, dumb, annoying hot boy who I've known for probably two months at this point.He was new to my area.I really did not like this kid. I only put up with him because of dope. No friendship at all.Nick on the other hand is my boy, we grew up together. and we had been running partners for 3 years at this time.) So, we proceed to get high af, and we start to drive home. I stop at wawa, grab some ports, pump my gas. I hop back in the car and nick gives me this look. Fred is passed out. Wrecked. With the bag right next to him. So i grabbed it. Then woke him up. ""Listen fred, this bag belongs to me now. Because I'm not a total dickhead im still gonna break you off, but if you try anything, you'll get nothing. There's two of us and one of you. What's it gonna be?"" he really had no choice but to accept it, at least at that time. He was way too high and got caught slippin, there's no loyalty in this game. So i let him keep 10 buns, and gave him the $7500 that he originally gave to nick and I. (He paid for all the dope and coke) This really isn't the end of the story, The aftermath is way crazier and ill probably post it later if anybody at all reads this.",1502218373.0

The crack is excellent, the heroin is incredible, and this long period without chemical euphoria has come to an end!

Also hi.,"Long time lurker here, never posted. Forgive the new account, I create a dump one for everything online. Not a user, never really had any friends on any of this shit either (besides the one, but he's got more diagnoses than prescriptions and his 3 neurologists still don't have a clue what to do lol, don't think he counts since it's all medical and inconsistent).

Wanted to ask some questions for y'all. Gonna ask the questions first, tell y'all a little about myself below.

What can I do in my everyday life to help y'all out? Been happy to drop a few twenties once I'm making my own bills and rent and after I get my neighbors some food money for the month. I carry a pack of cigs and a couple lighters for anyone who wants em. Working on getting Narcan to keep in with my edc kit along with my mask and other 1st aid, but it's taking a bit. Trying to figure out how to subtly ask my work to install a sharps container, I think I'm close to getting one put in at my local coffee shop. I try to educate people that are willing to listen when the subject comes up. Besides that else would y'all want from me? 

I like sitting and talking to folks, end up meeting a lot of people going through wd, or just down on their luck for a day or a decade at a time. Usually seem pretty chill with a cup of coffee and McDs lol, I don't got much more. Almost copped for a guy a couple of times just cause you could see the pain in his eyes, never did since both of the two times it was downtown and cops were rolling (of course they didn't give a fuck about the dude on the ground either time), can't risk my job and my life over that. Never want to leave a dude in an alley in that sort of state though, could barely move. Always end up walking away without doing much more than checking breathing, heart rate, and maybe leaving some food/water nearby. Leaves me feeling pretty useless. Thank god I haven't had to call ems yet, I'm lucky af so far there.

Also, what can I do in a position of some amount of influence over kids? I'm a high school teacher. Scares the shit out of me thinking about them trying any of this, they got enough to deal with. I'm not gonna say even on a burner account if I know any of them are using (massive consequences for that shit in this field), but we all know a few are gonna at some point. What can I do, say? Getting parents involved is something, idk. I've seen that go wrong back when I was in school, ended up poorly both times for all involved. Feel a bit helpless there and it kills me thinking about it. Can't really discuss this stuff with colleagues with any real honestly without putting my position in jeopardy either. Online hasn't been a whole lotta help, too many ""resources"" still want to pretend this shit ain't happening. Ideas?

Anyways, that's mostly it. I'm not a heavy user of anything, I know I get addicted to shit easy. Tried a few things over the years, any stims weird me out and get me panicky, weed makes me anxious now, and psychedelics are amazing but never around. I'm the type that'll want to try anything once but knows damn well he shouldn't. Opiates always called to me, ever since I watched Apocalypse Now in high school lol. That scene told me one day I was gonna smoke some shit, and I always dreamed of being in the mountains of Pakistan. Stupid dream I know, but hell lord knows I've wanted to be up in those gray rock peaks under cold skies watching a bleak landscape move with some of the most warm feeling I could imagine.

I know I'm too fucked in the head to do it right now, though. I don't respect this drug, how can I, never tried it, but I respect the shit I've seen people deal with because of it, and that's enough right now. Still want to someday, but I'm the kinda person that only does stupid stuff if I'm in control of it, and it doesn't seem like you can control this stuff. I'm happy to wait till I'm 60 and dying of bone cancer like my grandad and then I'm buying my ticket to go get my ass knocked out by some high quality tea up in some tiny-ass village who won't mind a dude willing to share some food and stories before slipping away into that warmth.

Lots more to me, ask away, will say what I can. Y'all here are good folk, come here whenever I'm down or need some meditation, there's honesty in this place that you don't find in most people in real life. Same reason I go downtown and chill with the homeless folk whenever I can, they got stories like nobody else. Don't have to be true, as long as they're telling me something that makes us both happy. They're honest about shit most people clam up about, even if they'll say whatever it takes when the wd kicks in. Idk, been wanting to say hi for a while now.",1502378402.0

What I do is put 1ml in my spoon, take a cotton, stick in there, and then bring it to the side of the spoon where theres no water and press hard on it letting the juice seep down into the water til theres nothing left. Then I pick up the cotton and squeeze it with my fingers over the water and set it to the side. I repeat that process for however many im using, into the one solution.

About $40CAD and waiting almost three weeks, I had high hopes. I had read in the past about the uses of agmatine, and even tried a single dose a long time ago shortly before dosing with oxycontin, but it was mainly on a whim that I bought this, thinking that my tolerance was getting too high for comfort (rather, for affordability). I have gone from taking 25mg three times a day to 45mg thrice daily, morphine, insufflated (or the equivalent in hydromorphone; often a mix of the two). I also expect, unfortunately, to be off opiates in a few months for financial reasons (even though I absolutely cannot function without them).

As soon as I got it I weighed up three capsules, total 100mg, and added the white powder to them; reweighing, I got 640mg total, or 540mg agmatine. 25 minutes later I took 30mg morphine and 3mg hydromorphone.

I like having a large quantity of powder going up my nostril; without that cough and choke, a lot of the rush is removed for me, which is why I tend to mix the otherwise small quantity of morphine (0.5x60mg) powder with a large quantity of hydromorphone (3x1mg) powder.

This combination definitely works. It felt strong enough for me to feel compelled to reduce my next dose by the equivalent of 10mg of morphine, and yet I am feeling quite high anyway. Definitely a magnitude of high higher off 5mg hydro + 10mg morphine than I would had I taken a whole 60mg morphine.",1502345020.0

I don't feel bad for burning fred, or being involved in the original robbery. The majority of people would have done the same thing I did under the  circumstance. ""the game is the game"". If you dont wanna get burnt for 32 racks. Then dont come to a strange city to meet even stranger people. What I am not proud of, is how I reacted during the aftermath. This whole come up and how it just fell into my lap was the only major W i have had during my junkie career.  I really felt like JJ himself personally blessed Me for all my years in the game struggling to get by. 

Also, as many of you noticed in part 1, Fred is a complete fucking moron, like his stupidity is legendary. but despite all his flaws, I still give Fred MAJOR points for having balls of kevlar and a whole lotta heart. I could not have made this shit up if I wanted to. This come up was stranger than fiction, I went from trying to leave the scene of an unplanned robbery (that i made clear i wouldnt participate in, I was just his ride) to being up about $20k in a matter of minutes. I thought it was the W of the century, I couldnt believe my luck. Like many of you pointed out, the really insane part was that anybody would attempt to re-up from fred, for any amount. Thats just a bad idea, i mean, he's a junkie right? If youre smart enough to trap your way up to 32k, you should not be making such rookie mistakes. Why would the vic show up alone, with no gun, in a city that isnt his, with a backpack full of cash, and then hand over that bag to fucking fred??? Unbelievable. Some might say the vic was just asking to get burnt. 

After i took possession of the bag, Nick and I started asking Fred 21 questions. The way fred told it, he knew the vic from his hometown. Pre-Heroin, and the vic used to buy weed from him. In his words ""I was running that town bro, his connect got booked and he needed to re up bad, so he called me"". okay. Even though i dont believe that at all, they clearly had some sort of trust built up for the vic to put his trust in fred. We then asked what he was gonna do when he inevitably came looking for his backpack of money. Fred told us the kid was a bitch and wouldn't do shit, in fact, he said the vic had way more than 32K and he wouldnt miss it too much. At that point I didn't know what to believe, I was just so psyched to actually have a good amount of dope and money, so it this point I stopped asking questions and focused on getting to my house, with the bag.

Okay, back to the story.... So we leave wawa, starting the drive home. Fred wasn't even pissed he got burnt by us, He was handing out ben franklins to homeless people, begging me to drive him to Del Friscos (Famous Steakhouse, super boujee) and just generally being stoked out of his mind. Right when we get on the highway and cross the county line out of the city, a god damn state trooper pulls out to follow me. Needless to say, I was freaking the fuck out. Ill never forget this feeling, I was convinced I was going away for life, this car was full of felonies. I remember thinking that this was instant karma and I was in way over my head. Obviously, he didnt pull me over because I would still be upstate for that one. We make it back to fred's neighborhood, I drop him off at a random persons house. He gets out and ACTUALLY FUCKING THANKS ME, daps me up, and goes inside. This is where me and nick freak out, because we actually pulled it off! I woke up with nothing and now we have hundreds of bags and something like 22.5K. We go grab a pound of weed, then split the take (50/50 cause thats my mans). Then we call everyone from the neighborhood and tell them to meet us at the park for a celebration. A good time was had by all, and i ended up staying the night at some girls house. 

I wake up to my phone blowing the fuck up, Nick is freaking out. tells me not to go home, the vic is posted outfront of my house. With two cars full of hard core looking rican dudes. Knocking on my neighbors doors, asking for me by name... GREATTTTTT. So i went home to try and do some damage control, but mainly I went home to shift all the blame from me, onto fred. I call fred and warn him ""the shit has hit the fan fred, there is a fly in the ointment, the lion will speak! Get the fuck outta dodge, DO NOT GO HOME, they're probably outside our house as we speak!""

I pull up to my house and approach the rather conspicuous cars full of dave east lookalikes in my middle class suburban neighborhood. So, they show some guns, i get ruffed up a little bit. Nothing too crazy tho because we were outfront of my house in broad daylight. So they ask me where the money is and i immediately throw fred right under the bus. (I know, I know. Not a thorough move.) I tell them it was all his idea, I got $500 to drive him to the city and i was actually just driving away when he decided to dive into my car, (Which is true) i pointed out he never called me and instructed me to be driving down the street at that moment. He saw his opportunity to get away with the money, and he took it. I still dont know for sure how they found out where I lived, Im guessing my license plate? Maybe some facebook snooping? Anyway, the goon squad rolls out, en route to presumably fuck fred's whole life up and get the money back. I start blowing his phone up but its switched off.

About a week later i found out what happened to fred. Apparently, right after I talked to him he decides to get high AF and shoot up his opiate naive MINOR neighbor. his neighbor, predictably, overdoses. Fred flees the scene when the older sister calls the cops and ambulance. The older sister tells the cops that fred was responsible. So the cops go to freds house, squad deep. Fred's mom lets the cops in, and the cops end up finding all the dope and money. The cops find Fred hiding out in a tree house or something, and arrest him.  The goon squad must have seen this go down and they obviously heard that fred got caught with a shit ton of heroin, cocaine, and cash. Once they heard that, they just took the L, charged it to the game and never came back around.

 I could have gotten Fred killed that day, and this should make it clear to everyone reading that if i wanted to fabricate a story, I wouldnt make myself look like such a grimy bitch. but this is how it went down. Fortunately, nobody got killed because of my stupid actions. At that time i didn't care about any collateral damage, I was only concerned about enjoying all my free dope and cash. I dont live like that anymore, and I think I've grown up a lot since this incident. But now R/opiates knows what My friends, family, neighbors, and myself have known for many years. Kenzo is a junkie piece of shit and shouldn't be trusted.

Fred got charged up with all types of felonies, his mom eventually scrapes together enough money to bail him out, and this dickhead gets out of jail, tries to rob wawa with a kitchen knife. Gets booked again, more felonies. He ended up getting a 5-10 uptop, and nick and I get away basically scot free, and we ran through that fucking bag like the junkie losers we are.

6sqvgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6sqvgu/using_an_ocd_relief_approach_to_addiction/,4,https://redd.it/6sqvgu,curiouspapageorgio,Using an OCD relief approach to addiction,"I have experienced the most fulfilling abstinence lately due to a very powerful adaptation of a Dr. at UCLA's 4 step approach for OCD patients to be rid of their issue. This is Dr. Gabor Mate's rendition of Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz's OCD approach in the context of addiction (the two processes are very similar in terms of brain mechanism, the main difference being the OCD patient's impulse does not bring intrinsic pleasure, thus making it sometimes harder for addicts.)

Step 1: Re-label

In Step 1 you label the addictive thought or urge exactly for what it is,
not mistaking it for reality. Imay feel, for example, that Imust leave off
whatever I’m doing right now and go to the classical music store. The
feeling takes on the quality of a need, of an imperative that must
immediately be satisfied. Another person will say that she needs to
have a chocolate bar immediately or needs to do this or that,
depending on the object of the addiction. When we re-label, we give
up the language of need. I say to myself: “I don’t need to purchase
anything now or to eat anything now; I’m only having an obsessive
thought that I have such a need. It’s not a real, objective need but a
false belief. Imay have a feeling of urgency, but there is actually
nothing urgent going on.”
Essential to the first step, as to all the steps, is conscious
awareness. It is conscious intention and attention, not just rote
repetition that will result in beneficial changes to brain patterns,
thoughts and behaviours. Be fully aware of the sense of urgency that
attends the impulse and keep labelling it as a manifestation of
addiction, rather than any reality that you must act upon. “In Relabelling,”
writes Dr. Schwartz, “you bring into play the Impartial
Spectator, a concept that Adam Smith used as the central feature of
his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments. He defined the Impartial
Spectator as the capacity to stand outside yourself and watch yourself
in action, which is essentially the same mental action as the ancient
Buddhist concept of mindful awareness.”1
The point of re-labelling is not to make the addictive urge disappear —it’s not going to, at least not for a long time, since it was wired into
the brain long ago. It is strengthened every time you give in to it and
every time you try to suppress it forcibly. The point is to observe it with
conscious attention without assigning the habitual meaning to it. It is no
longer a “need,” only a dysfunctional thought. Rest assured, the urge
will come back—and again you will re-label it with determination and mindful awareness. “Conscious attention must be paid,” Jeffrey
Schwartz emphasizes. “Therein lies the key. Physical changes in the
brain depend for their creation on a mental state in the mind—the state
called attention. Paying attention matters.”

Step 2: Re-attribute

“In Re-attribute you learn to place the blame squarely on your brain.
This is my brain sending me a false message.”3 This step is designed
to assign the re-labelled addictive urge to its proper source. In Step 1
you recognized that the compulsion to engage in the addictive
behaviour does not express a real need or anything that “must”
happen; it’s only a belief. In Step 2 you state very clearly where that
urge originated: in neurological circuits that were programmed into
your brain long ago, when you were a child. It represents a dopamine
or endorphin “hunger” on the part of brain systems that, early in your
life, lacked the necessary conditions for their full development. It also
represents emotional needs that went unsatisfied.
Re-attribution is directly linked with compassionate curiosity toward
the self. Instead of blaming yourself for having addictive thoughts or
desires, you calmly ask why these desires have exercised such a
powerful hold over you. “Because they are deeply ingrained in my brain
and because they are easily triggered whenever I’m stressed or
fatigued or unhappy or bored.” The addictive compulsion says nothing
about you as a person. It is not a moral failure or a character
weakness; it is just the effect of circumstances over which you had no
control. What you do have some control over is how you respond to the
compulsion in the present. You were not responsible for the stressful
circumstances that shaped your brain and worldview, but you can take
responsibility now.
Re-attribution helps you put the addictive drive into perspective: it’s
no more significant than, say, a momentary ringing in your ear. Just as
there is no “bell” that causes the ringing, so there is no real need that
the addictive urge will satisfy. It is only a thought, an attitude, a belief, a
feeling arising from an automatic brain mechanism. You can observe it
consciously, with attention. And you can let it go. There are better
sources of dopamine or endorphins in the world, and more satisfying
ways to have your needs for vitality and intimacy met. Once more, don’t allow yourself to be frustrated when what you have
let go returns. It will—probably soon. When it does, you will re-label it
and re-attribute it: “Hello, old brain circuits,” you say. “I see you’re still
active. Well, so am I.” If you change how you respond to those old
circuits, you will eventually weaken them. They will persist for a long
time—perhaps even all your life, but only as shadows of themselves.
They will no longer have the weight, the gravitational pull or the appeal
they once boasted. You will no longer be their marionette.

Step 3: Re-focus

In the Re-focus step you buy yourself time. Although the compulsion to
open the bag of cookies or turn on the TV or drive to the store or the
casino is powerful, its shelf life is not permanent. Being a mindphantom,
it will pass, and you have to give it time to pass. The key
principle here, as Dr. Schwartz points out, is this: “It’s not howyou feel
that counts; it’s what you do.”
Rather than engage in the addictive activity, find something else to
do. Your initial goal is modest: buy yourself just fifteen minutes.
Choose something that you enjoy and that will keep you active:
preferably something healthy and creative, but anything that will please
you without causing greater harm. Instead of giving in to the siren call
of the addiction, go for a walk. If you “need” to drive to the casino, turn
on the TV. If you “need” to watch television, put on some music. If you
“need” to buy music, get on your exercise bike. Whatever gets you
through the night—or at least through the next fifteen minutes. “Early in
therapy,” advises Jeffrey Schwartz, “physical activity seems to be
especially helpful. But the important thing is that whatever activity you
choose, it must be something you enjoy doing.”4
The purpose of Re-focus is to teach your brain that it doesn’t have to
obey the addictive call. It can exercise the “free won’t.” It can choose
something else. Perhaps in the beginning you can’t even hold out for
fifteen minutes—fine. Make it five, and record it in a journal as a
success. Next time, try for six minutes, or sixteen. This is not a
hundred-metre dash but a solo marathon you are training for.
Successes will come in increments.
As you perform the alternative activity, stay aware of what you are
doing. You are doing something difficult. No matter how simple it may
seem to others who do not have to live with your particular brain, you
know that holding out for even a short period of time is an
achievement. You are teaching your old brain new tricks. Unlike the
case with old dogs, no one can tell you it can’t be done.

Step 4: Re-value

This step should really be called De-value. Its purpose is to help you
drive into your own thick skull just what has been the real impact of the
addictive urge in your life: disaster. You know this already, and that is
why you are engaged in these four steps. It’s because of the negative
impact that you’ve taken yourself by the scruff of the neck and delayed
acting on the impulse while you’ve re-labelled and re-attributed it and
while you have re-focused on some healthier activity. In this Re-value
step you will remind yourself why you’ve gone to all this trouble. The more clearly you see how things are, the more liberated you will be. We know that the addicted brain assigns a falsely high value to the
addictive object, substance or behaviour, the process called salience
attribution. The addicted mind has been fooled into making the object
of your addiction the highest priority. Addiction has moved in and
taken over your attachment-reward and incentive-motivation circuits. Where love and vitality should be, addiction roosts. The distorted brain
circuits, including the orbitofrontal cortex, are making you believe that
experiences that can come authentically only from genuine intimacy,
creativity or honest endeavour will be yours for the taking through
addiction. In the Re-value step you de-value the false gold. You assign
to it its proper worth: less than nothing. What has this addictive urge done for me? you will ask. It has
caused me to spend money heedlessly or to stuff myself when I wasn’t
hungry or to be absent from the ones I love or to expend my energies
on activities I later regretted. It has wasted my time. It has led me to lie
and to cheat and to pretend—first to myself and then to everyone close
to me. It has left me feeling ashamed and isolated. It promised joy and
delivered bitterness. Such has been its real value to me; such has
been the effect of my allowing some disordered brain circuits to run my
life. The real “value” of my addictive compulsion has been that it has
caused me to betray my true values and disregard my true goals.
Be conscious as you write out this fourth step—and do write it out,
several times a day if necessary. Be specific: What has been the value
of the urge in your relationship with your wife? your husband? your
partner, your best friend, your children, your boss, your employees,
your co-workers? What happened yesterday when you allowed the
urge to rule you? What happened last week? What will happen today?
Pay close attention to what you feel when you recall these events and
when you foresee what’s ahead if you persist in permitting the
compulsion to overpower you. Be aware. That awareness will be your
guardian.
Do all this without judging yourself. You are gathering information,
not conducting a criminal trial against yourself. Jesus said: “If you bring
forth what is within you, what you have will save you.”
 That is true in
so many ways. Within you is knowledge of the real value of the
impulses you have obeyed until now. To quote and paraphrase Dr.
Schwartz, the more consciously and actively you come to re-value the
addictive drive in light of its pernicious influence on your life, “the more
quickly and smoothly you can perform the Re-label, Re-attribute and
Re-focus steps and the more steadily your brain’s ‘automatic
transmission’ function returns. Re-valuing helps you shift the behavioral
gears!”
Dr. Schwartz introduces what he calls the two A’s: Anticipate and
Accept. To anticipate is to know that the compulsive drive to engage in
addictive behaviour will return. There is no final victory—every moment
the urge is turned away is a triumph. What is certain is that with time
the addictive drive will be drained of energy if you continue to apply the
four steps and also take care of the internal and external environments
in the ways suggested in these chapters. If there are times when it
reappears with new force, there is no reason to be disappointed or
shocked by that. And accept that the addiction exists not because of
yourself, but in spite of yourself. You did not come into life asking to be
programmed this way. It’s not personal to you—millions of others with
similar experiences have developed the same mechanisms. What is
personal to you is how you respond to it in the present. Keep close to
your impartial observer.
I take the liberty of suggesting a fifth step to be added to the FourStep
Self-Treatment Method, at least in the context of addiction. I call it
Re-create.

Step 5: Re-create

Life, until now, has created you. You’ve been acting according to
ingrained mechanisms wired into your brain before you had a choice
in the matter, and it’s out of those automatic mechanisms that you’ve
created the life you now have. It is time to re-create: to choose a
different life.
You have values. You have passions. You have intention, talent,
capability. In your heart there is love, and you want to connect that with
the love in the world, in the universe. As you re-label, re-attribute, refocus
and re-value, you are releasing patterns that have held you and
that you have held on to. In place of a life blighted by your addictive
need for acquisition, self-soothing, admiration, oblivion, meaningless
activity, what is the life you really want? What do you choose to create?
Consider, too, what activities you can engage in to express the
universal human need to be creative. Mindfully honouring our creativity
helps us transcend the feeling of deficient emptiness that drives
addiction. Not to express our creative needs is itself a source of
stress. I permit myself here to quote from the final pages of When the
Body Says No, my book on illness, stress and mind-body unity:
For many years after becoming a doctor Iwas too caught up in my
workaholism to pay attention to myself or to my deepest urges. In
the rare moments I permitted any stillness, I noted a small
fluttering at the pit of my belly, a barely perceptible disturbance.
The faint whisper of a word would sound in my head: writing. At
first I could not say whether it was heartburn or inspiration. The more I listened, the louder the message became: I needed to
write, to express myself through written language not only so that
others might hear me but so that I could hear myself.
The gods, we are taught, created humankind in their own
image. Everyone has an urge to create. Its expression may flow
through many channels: through writing, art or music or through the
inventiveness of work or in any number of ways unique to all of us,
whether it be cooking, gardening or the art of social discourse.
The point is to honour the urge. To do so is healing for ourselves
and for others; not to do so deadens our bodies and our spirits. When I did not write, I suffocated in silence.
“What is in us must out,” wrote the great Canadian stress
researcher, Dr. Hans Selye, “otherwise we may explode at the
wrong places or become hopelessly hemmed in by frustrations.
The great art is to express our vitality through the particular
channels and at the particular speed Nature foresawfor us.”
Write down your values and intentions and, one more time, do so
with conscious awareness. Envision yourself living with integrity,
creative and present, being able to look people in the eye with
compassion for them—and for yourself. The road to hell is not paved
with good intentions. It is paved with lack of intention. Re-create. Are
you afraid you will stumble? Of course you will: that’s called being a
human being. And then you will take the four steps—plus one—again",1502337760.0

I love browsing reddit, especially the drug related posts, but with that comes having to read some seriously belittling and condecending thoughts. The worst is when you are on r/drugs, like Jesus Christ take a look around you, you are on a subreddit dedicated to drugs! and no where does it state all opinions on drugs have to be negative. Once post I saw was a girl who found a baggy in her house which belonged to a roommate she believed, and it had dark brown residue, most likely bth. it was post after post of PACK YOUR SHIT OR YOU WONT HAVE ANY SHIT LEFT! followed by people getting scientific and stating that you can't have heroin without shady clepto behavior. literally people in a drug forum saying that H isn't a recreational drug its a escape when you have nothing left. I have been using for years, I would never steal from someone, ever, under any circumstance. I would rather suffer and go without then put suffering onto anyone else. I also love my life, make good money and do not need to escape anything. it just makes me sad sometimes that a open conversation can never be had about this, everyone in the world is an expert on H when it comes down to talking about it, everyone is so sure they know absolutely who you are if you do H. I love this forum, miles ahead of r/drugs, but even here sometimes you run into the generalizations. is it wrong of me to want people to judge on a case by case basis? am I the one in the wrong here, I don't believe in generalizing, I believe life is so intricate and complex that generalizations do us as a people a huge disservice. Why can't we think for ourselves and make our judgments based on the information presented to us, not based on preconceived notions we have? Free thinking, I will always exercise my right to entertain everything I'm presented with as a unique situation and will always accept I don't know anyones full story. sorry for this rant, I just hate how people shut down any thought that goes against the mainstream ideas on drugs, drugs can be terrible and like a cancer, but they can also be beautiful, its that wide spectrum that pulls me in, so much of everything, to generalize is such a shame imho..

1. Most important is that you get it from a good vendor and usually headahop brands  suck however there might be a solid brand depending on how many places you go. It overall they are much more expensive than a vendors prices since for about the same price you can get 4-5grams of Kratom for every 1gram from th head shop 



2. Depending on your daily habit and how high your tolerance is you will likely need to do more. But I have also heard ""less is more for Kratom"" so everyone is different but for me personally I need about 10-20grams 2 times a day in wds



3. The symptoms of my wds that Kratom takes care of are the following:

- no diahreah 

- no hot or cold flashes and only minimal sweating (but only cause I sweat really easily as long as I can remember so it might just be my body being normal)

- helps my appetite, as a matter of fact I get the freaking munchies later in the day after taking Kratom 

- enough energy to go out in public/be at work but no enough energy to motivate me to do work lol

- eases anxiety a tiny bit but still there

What it really doesn't help with 
 - motivation I still have non of it. I sit there just in a mental state of no emotions really

- cravings

- body aches


Now different strains are also a legit concept. My favorite was white dragon and red meng da as both gave me a little bit more of energy than other strains. But the energy didn't last long and also got a slight head change. Red Bali and the Gold are not really all that great, more over rested also I tried the red md extract which is suppose to be stronger but didn't help much either. 

Best way to feel it was taking it usually first thing in the morning as I feel the worst then and it's best taken on an empty stomach. And then either at lunch and dinner but been taking it invetween those times to cut to only 2 times a day.  Also about 15-20 to feel it easing the symptoms. I wasn't a believer until it actually helped ease my wds so I suggest people give it a chance and get a good brand to recap and then you will see Kratom helps a ton ",1502322721.0

(Dependent on *suboxone* and want to stop),"So last year In October I had been addicted to heroin for four months and benzos for over a year. I wanted to, you know, not be.

Benzos were cheap so I worried about that later.

I got a sub script in October but given that I wasn't addicted to H for that long, I ignored the doctor's orders to ""stay on forever"" and weened off to nothing in December. Was actually successful!

Then throughout December I weened myself slowly off benzos which... sucked. It's weird, benzo and opioid withdrawal both suck but are different. Anyway.

I realized having like 2mg of suboxone (I had a shit ton left over) really made withdrawal feel fine. I did this once every three days or so.

Then in January back in college I used a small amount of suboxone after workouts cuz preworkout made me feel like shit.

I realized that was bad so I stopped, then realized I was physically dependent on the suboxone, had withdrawls and everything...So I went back to the doctor asked for subs and he said ""I fucking told you.""

But I still want to get off it.. But school wasn't the greatest place to be a useless person, and I haven't wanted to be useless since starting my first real job out of college. I've tried totally jumping off even from such a low dose and I feel too fatigued to move.

So tldr; I've been taking like 1 mg of sub every couple days or so, waking up feeling like shit lots of mornings and feel like I'm in mild withdrawal lots of the time, and have for months.

So... this is gonna get worse if I keep this routine up huh? I kind of need to function and can't just jump off but I REALLY WANT TO",1502319799.0

So I called for awhile afterward to see if anything came of it, no one could ever find a case for me in the system on it. Eventually Christmas and New Years came around, my aunt died of cancer super young and tragically. Lost the number, stopped calling.

Got stopped at checkpoints and have had my ID run numerous times since then; nothing. Even a background check at work showed up zero

I know this might not work, but I have insurance that pays for all of my fees so I might as well give it a try. ",1502317739.0

I was clean when I met him almost 14 years ago, but he found my methadone one day. I got off the methadone before we were married, 11 years ago, and before any of my kids were born.

I have never relapsed on opiates but I have had a period of crack use for a year or so, about 6 years ago.

I already have temporary sole custody, it's been that way since we separated about 5 years ago. 
Now that I have served him with the divorce papers, he's making these threats, that he will ""expose"" me.

Now really, I don't give a shit if he tells the whole world, I am clean and sober today and can't change my past mistakes.

So, how full of shit is he? Would a judge take away custody over these claims? My hope is a judge will tell him that it is not relevant to today.",1502313312.0

I want to tell someone the context before I actually ask.
I live in a country with almost inexistent opiate troubles, and IV abuse is unheard of. So I buy morphine vials in, meet in the underground station at plain sight. I walk to find a place to shot while I load my rig, poorly hiding inside my backpack. I find a bench an shot in a busy street. I used a big needle, 23 or 25, can't remember, so blood begins to run down my arm and into my shirt, before I could reach a papeltowel. So my t-shirt got a big blood stain, that I can cover with my sweater, but will be noticeable at home and I live with my parents.
Any advice on how to get rid of it?
