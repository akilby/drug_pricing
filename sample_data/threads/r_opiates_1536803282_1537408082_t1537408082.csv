And I compare the cognitive effect, that it does this, to MDMA (not in a rolling way but the emotionally openness). For example I took it earlier today (20mg IR) and I‚Äôm feeling pretty depressed, back in bed listening to music I haven‚Äôt touched in weeks, with the ability to cry (something I absolutely can‚Äôt do sober anymore since the age 12-13, until I learn that sober skill again).

It always gives me this calm headspace yet focused but it‚Äôs almost sedating almost always for me. I tried abusing it once (taking 20mg tablets throughout the night with a buddy 1-2 at a time ever hour, not a smoker but I sure smoked over 15+ cigs that night) and I felt absolutely guilty and disgusting (even though I just talked small talk all night) as the ‚Äúbinge‚Äù ended 2pm and I was up for almost 2 days, first day didn‚Äôt abuse, couldn‚Äôt sleep and the second day without sleep I decided to wanna feel what everyone loved about it. Not even at the 160mg range mark after all that night..

Anyways, yeah it‚Äôs making me feel depressed, mentally focused slightly but sedated in a weird way hard to describe.. other times I‚Äôve gotten productive, hungry.

But the main point is I noticed, depending on *my* mood, Adderall amplifies how I feel inside in a sense.
Doesn‚Äôt feel no where near MDMA except for this openness trait on my mood. 

Adderall for me isn‚Äôt like Opiates where when your up, down, left, right, crazy, it always put me in a normal, on the happy side of my headspace, but I was still emotionally rational and functional.

I want to know if anyone else has this similar effect? Somewhat at least?",1537407754.0

I am a little worried about a locum GP (any brother Brits on here will know what I mean!) who prescribed me 7.5mg zopiclone to help ease some crippling insomnia. S/he didn't radiate confidence and I've had a serious incident with a clueless GP last year - the GP doubled my azathioprine dose for five days to help with an Crohn's mini-flare. Turns out it was a severely toxic dose and was the final bullet that killed my thyroid. Hence why I'd feel much better with some amateur-experts opinions!

I'm on 10mg Subutex a day and currently no other narcotics or first generation sedative anti-histamines. Long story short I was on a cocktail of codeine, long release dihydrocodeine, cyclizine (a great booster, but legitimately the only anti-emetic that worked to stop 15-20 vomiting sessions a day) and liquid morphine to deal with several bad bowel blockages that led to two major resections in 7 months.

I was told as long as I took only one 7.5mg a night for a couple of days there should be no problem with the buprenorphine combo due to it's ceiling for respiratory depression, and that I'm already above it.

Anyone with personal experience, or with a well rounded knowledge agree with that? Bloody comes to something when the users are better placed than a doctor!

Just out of interest (and my addictive personality needing to know!) would codeine/zopiclone cause problems due to the lack of respiratory ceiling?

9h1fv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9h1fv2/i_think_im_done/,31,https://redd.it/9h1fv2,iwanttomakesense,I think I'm done,"I've been on oxycodone and morphine for almost two years now. I have a connective tissue disorder and the only way that I can describe it is that I just hurt all the time. On a good day it feels like I had my ass kicked two days ago. On a bad day it feels like there's acid in my shoulder blades or hot needles in my back. Sometimes I get headaches that last for days where I lose most of my vision and puke uncontrollably. It drove me crazy. I lost my wife, my job, my kids. I tried to kill myself several times.

Then after years of negative experiences with health care specialists, I finally found a doctor that listened to me. We tried a few different drugs before settling on oxycodone. Then we added morphine on top. For the most part the meds helped with the baseline pain, we never could get the headaches under control though and they got progressively worse, especially this summer. I lost my job again. Got a new, better paying one right after and couldn't make it through the first night shift as my back was spasming and had to leave the shop several times to throw up. Lost that one too. Almost immediately.

I had also been seeing a doctor at a pain clinic who would give me nerve block injections sometimes up to fifty injections all along my back, neck, head and face. They don't help, they just make me uncomfortably numb for a few hours at most until my symptoms return but I do it anyways because it looks better on paper that as someone taking opioids, I am also seeking other avenues of treatment.

He recently left and I was switched to a new doctor who on our third visit suggested we 'give effexor a try and see how that works out' and told me I was a drug seeker when I informed him that no, I had been on effexor when I was younger for depression and I did not want to go back to that for a multitude of reasons. He told me that I was a drug seeker and typed a lot of what I imagine were some pretty negative things to my primary physician through the medical portal that they use to communicate with each other. I tried not to think about it and sat there as he silently injected me with local anesthetic after his sanctimonious diatribe.

When I went to refill my script, I didn't realize it at the time but my prescription had been cut in half without any warning from my doctor. I didn't notice because the script had been written for a month this time - I normally have to request a refill every two weeks so the amount was still technically the same as always in terms of both amount and cost. The pharmacist, who has always  treated me like a junkie from the moment I filled my first script, didn't even bother to mention the change. Had I have to thought to read the label I would have seen the ""DOSE REDUCED"" but such is life.

My head had been pretty brutal for most of August and the first part of September so naturally I ran out earlier than expected... Even earlier than usual. When I finally did look at the bottle to double check when my next refill was due, I noticed the dose had been changed. After the interaction with the 'pain specialist' I can only assume that this was meant to be a taper off. My doctor has never expressed any desire to lower my dose in the past and the fact that she did it without explaining why does not look good at all.

The last week has been hell to say the least  and I still have to wait two more to find out what the hell is going on but the situation looks pretty grim. My symptoms are back in full force most days and the withdrawals on top of that just about killed me and tbh I genuinely wanted to die. But now I'm feeling better in a really, really fucking wierd way.

I recently started therapy, which the old me would have never done but I genuinely wanted to work on my mental health even before I knew I was likely losing my meds. Withdrawing during the first session was probably one of the worst experiences of my life. At the same time though, it was an amazingly gratifying situation. The WD's had made me so vulnerable that I was unable to keep my normal facade up and I actually just talked. And kept talking. I'm not proud to say but I had to hold back tears for alot of it. It was the perfect storm, I was like a therapists wet dream. For the first time in my life I was actively addressing the problems in my life instead of desperately trying to avoid them.

While the WD's are gone for the most part. I don't think the cravings will ever really go away but I hope eventually they'll start to subside. I've been using the short amount of  time that I've been 'clean' and in therapy to think about the road ahead, and I have two options at this point. One being heroin, as pills are hard to come by in my neck of the woods and the small amount that I had access to for times like these are no longer available. And two, accept my fate and try to be as positive as I can about it. Deal with the pain and do my best to be happy and show those that are important to me how much I care about them instead of never texting or calling anybody back, never leaving the house except for work/ visits my kids, or nodding myself to sleep every fucking night because I can't handle the physical or mental pain that never ever seems to go away. And the fucked up thing is, I think I'm gonna go with option two.

Being without oxy has taken away my ability to shut off my brain when the demons want to hang out and I've had to face them head on. No more numbing myself because I miss my wife or kids. You miss them? Find a way to get them back, you fuck. No more passing out on the floor because I hate what my disorder has turned me into. You're in pain? Find a less physical job, dumbass. Stop hurting yourself for money, there are other options. No more getting fucked up because mom didn't love me growing up and won't talk to me as an adult. I just gotta deal with it. 

I'm still scared as shit about the headaches that I get because they seem to strike randomly and can last anywhere from an evening to a fortnight but you can't win em all, I guess. Then again they are a beast that even oxy couldn't tame so it's something I'm just gonna have to learn to live with.

I didn't really talk to any of you but I followed some of your stories pretty closely to the point that I felt like I knew you. I related to alot of the chaos in a lot of your lives. And I just want to say that I love you guys. Especially Metro so if you guys could do me a solid maybe stop downvoting his fucking wowzies? They were how I knew a post was fire and now I hardly see them anymore. FLJ, you seemed like a fucking character, congrats on the new mod position. Chasingd0pamine gets an honourable mention and of course Tracey. Tracey, you're doing the Lord's work. Pretty sure I read that you were feeling burnt out recently and I hope that you're doing better.

Thanks to the people that answered my dumb questions when I was confused about things like cold water extraction, and thanks to the people that answered the even dumber questions that I would ask on my burner accounts. My personal favourites were the ones where I thought I was dying because of certain drug cocktails that should never be taken but are also just too much fucking fun not to.

Everybody be safe out there, from my brothers and sisters on the needle to those of us who loved our pills just a little too much and everybody in between. Nod for me guys because I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to for a long, long time. If I ever do again.

Peace out opi fam.

Just earlier today I was totally DESPAIRING. A good shot of crack and heroin loaded up, I was sick as fuck, and could not find a vein anywhere. I've used up all my good sites - crook, arms, hand, wrists, feet, even my shoulders and around my biceps. For the last few weeks I've been thinking that I'm going to have to go neck or groin since it was getting SO difficult to hit a vein, and often when I did hit a vein trying to inject would cause searing pain and a weird red mark. Not a miss, but apparently the veins are obstructed, so even if I hit some blood and dont move the needle a millimeter it will still not be a hit. In desperation today, I tried somewhere new.

This may be common knowledge to you, but I decided to try the back side of my arm, the spot thats usually really awkward and difficult to hit because of the angle. That is until today when I realised that I could turn the needle so that I was injecting against the flow of blood - *away* from the heart - and still hit the vein perfectly fine! 

This has opened up a whole new area for me of really good veins that are giving that big purple gush of blood and its fucking awesome! I know they won't last forever, but I'm rotating my sites since for the first time since I started using this has opened up a whole new bunch of great veins at once, and I'm going to try and make them last. I didn't ever hit them before because if you try to put the needle in the right position i.e. with the flow of blood, they become unhittable as they are at a weird angle, but I have had three shots today and put the needle in the ""wrong"" way and have had zero problems. I know it's probably not ideal to go against the flow but it sure beats starting to use my groin or missing. 

Thought I'd post this in case there were any fellow junkies out there like me who didn't realise these veins could be hit by going against the flow. There is nothing worse than being sick and having the cure in your hand and not being able to get it into your body, so if this helps one fellow junkie then I be pleased.

Hope Junkie Jesus smiles on you all as he has guided my needle today! :) ",1537313100.0

It‚Äôs hard to fathom that he thought he‚Äôd become a heroin addiction (IV). I‚Äôm 99% sure he doesn‚Äôt bother to carry Narcan.,"Is there any possibility that my brother is happy?  I move him so much. We used to be so close. Or perhaps as close as he COULD be to a human?

I meant to say it‚Äôs hard to fathom that he would develop a severe heroin addiction. It happens so ok. But he put no attempts to slow the progression down, at all. He was able to do that with drinking and he‚Äôs a severe alcoholic. 

He heavily abused drugs and alcohol since he was a teen, heavily. A lot of it stems from a severe, unloving upbringing.  I was no angel, but he is the most reckless person I know.   I‚Äôm not judging ....just the way he was (is)?

He also betrays everyone, including me, but I‚Äôm not really mad. I know it‚Äôs up to him to choose kicking H - I don‚Äôt see it happening. I wish my intuition was wrong.  He lies so much. Even senseless lies. 

He changed and is it a personality change from withdrawal or long term drug and alcohol use?  I‚Äôm a recovered alcoholic and I‚Äôm lucky my liver is OK. 

He had a lot of aspirations‚Äî-he never cared for work but his college degree was so important to him. He dropped out senior year.  

His favorite author was at a local store today - signing books. It was a surprise!  It wasn‚Äôt Stephen King...but that popular. He would have been excited and I would have bought us both books to sign. Now, I bet he wouldn‚Äôt care.  

He‚Äôs handsome. Or was. His looks are GONE. He was a good dresser, too. A bit of vanity but he carried himself well. He looks like he was thrown in a ditch, face first.

I have a couple of other questions - but is he maybe satisfied with his life?  I want happiness for him. Saw him a few years ago, he‚Äôd OD‚Äôd and aspirated and I legally make medical decisions if he can‚Äôt consent. So much pain. 

I‚Äôm scared of him now. Especially ‚Äúfriends.‚Äù  Lots of B &amp;amp; E, including family. But true B&amp;amp; E plus knicking stuff to pawn during the day. 

He screws over everyone. Everyone. He got in the scene as an enforcer and I heard he‚Äôs been greenlit. He stole a bunch if opiates from the main dealer.  

Oh. He doesn‚Äôt work a regular job. So he‚Äôs scraping together money daily by whatever means. 

I need to quit worrying.  I can‚Äôt let go. Yet maybe it was all a lie. I freely gave him money thinking he was clean.  

He gave me company and safety when I left my marriage. I knew I‚Äôd given him 60k over a year and just as a gift....but I didn‚Äôt say steal. Just ask. 

He was homeless, too, so he needed a place to stay for free. I bet he is homeless a lot yet I cannot imagine. 

But what if he died?  Will he die happy?  I miss that f@cker but I do NOT trust him. ",1537311498.0

I go from 65 mg a day to about 50-70 mg of oxy a day for 8 days, oxy runs out so I get dope for 2 days to buy time until my saint of an ex gf brings me enough suboxone to get through the rest of the withdrawals.

Last year I managed to drag myself into treatment for 30 days after getting hooked on opiates for 3 nasty years. I started in college just like anyone else, oxys and whatnot. After a few years of barely scraping by I was about to fail out of school and was very reliant on heroin to get through my days. I couldnt take it anymore and my family couldnt either. I went to treatment last January. It was awesome actually I learned a lot and reopened my eyes to life. However, I didn't take anyones advice and stuck with suboxone. After treatment I managed to get a job I love working outside at a Garden Center. Right before the fall I was accepted by financial aid to finish my last semester at college and get my degree. Everything in me wanted to get off the suboxone before I started school. I was on 16mg a day so I started halfway through the summer. I got myself down to 1mg a day of suboxone. With a month before school, it hit me. I got high again. It's like I was living in a different reality because of the suboxone. Off and on, I've gotten right back to where I was. Instead of getting help or detoxing before school, I manned up and said I got this. Well it's a few weeks into the semester and I definitely don't got this. In fact I had to move home again, and my life has really affected my folks. My mom can't handle it anymore. She ended up figuring a lot out that I would never have included her in on (for the sake of her sanity), but she figured it out. At this point I just can't believe I got back to this point. I can't focus. I can't retain information. I'm usually a smart guy, but I've been reduced down to a t.v. watching dumbass who manages to go to work for 16 hours a week. I'm sad guys. I'm calling the treatment place I went to last year and I'm going tomorrow. The hardest part for me right now is how I'm going to get the University to understand I've fucked up once again, and how I'm going to tell my job that I'm going to be gone. The job is lowpaying and just some job, but I love the people like family. Guess I just needed to get this all out there since I havent been able to talk about it much.

Is this true for most people? She keeps mentioning how her skin feels like it‚Äôs crawling, she‚Äôs constantly agitated to the point her words are aggressive, she can‚Äôt stay still in bed at night,

What can she do for this? How does she get though this Gabapentin withdrawal? 

I can visibly see and I 100% believe that she‚Äôs going through hell.

- Opiates

Online it says that drug tests testing for opiates don't test for bupe because the drug tests for opiates check for a metabolite found in meth/heroin/prescription opiates like oxy but that metabolite is not found in bupe (my guess is because it's a pseudo)

How much truth to this is there? I know it gets out of your system quickly and I don't take it often so I shouldn't have a problem regardless but this bit of info would make me feel even safer if it's true.

But even there you find a lot of pants on head retarded shit.

&#x200B;

The point of maintenance therapy should be offering you a safe alternative to street drugs and the hustle and crime, period. Adding tons of catches and strings and red tape only drives people back to the street and now their tolerance is lower and DEAD! Bravo medical pros!  The only real reason to kick someone off is if they are not taking their meds and obvious financially diverting them, period. No one should be kicked off for pee tests coming back for other drugs, what the hell kind of sense does that make? Well we see here you are struggling, so get the fuck out and go back to your street H! What is this a jealous GF? You'd think a med pro would say hey it seems you are struggling, does your dose need increasing?

It seems like sometimes the rationale for the strict rules and zero tolerance is to get only those who are committed to quitting and are willing to show effort but I feel this is wrong. If it was seen more as government competing against the illicit market for those dependent, think of how much market share they could take away and lives back on track or even saved.

Surprisingly Canada and Britain and Australia and a lot of Europe is surprisingly backwards, even for subs they make you dose essentially like methadone. Have to come in every day to a pharmacy, dose in front of the disgusted pharmacist who hates dealing with this crap daily wasting his time. Sometimes at a special addicts counter or area, yea sounds great!

It turns out when you load up on a big supply of opiates without having ANY tolerance, it's pretty easy to just nod the FUCK out.

Oh well. Supply wise I've just been chilling on a massive supply of weed, usually with a bit of opium sprinkled into the joints, some dihydrocodeine and alazopram (courtesy of the pharmacy, no less!), as well as some nice strong heroin (just sniffing, no needles; no need)

It was a pretty weird feeling to walk into the pharmacy and ask for these super tightly controlled drugs and have the actual pharmacists just be like ""yeah, got you bro""

I could use some of your advice on what constitute great recreational pharmaceuticals, specifically opiates.
When I went yesterday, I just wrote down on a list- ""Vicoden, Alazopram, Codeine, Dilaudid, Fentynol"" and asked the pharmacists if they had any of those. They seemed to recognize the Fend and Vicoden but didn't have any in stock. I only checked two pharmacies because I have a serious lack of knowledge about prescriptions. I'm definitely gonna hit the pharmacies again and get more/better goodies.

The way the restaurants advertise and cook with weed here is fucking dope. The first day I got an extra extra strength ""happy pizza"" which knocked me on my fucking ass, and then yesterday I got the strongest possible ""happy milkshake"". Dude, it's like a big ole delicious milkshake that would be super delicious without any drugs (which you can't even taste) and it's only a couple bucks.

Two big upcoming missions: tomorrow I'm going to relocate from a hotel to an Airbnb. That's gonna mean I'll have a whole goddamn apartment to myself, full kitchen, living room, etc... AND this place has a motherfucking outdoor jacuzzi on a balcony with a direct view of the river! I'm gonna spend so much time chillin on that balcony getting fucked up, what a dream vacation.

The second big mission is renting a motorbike, 125 cc is all a man needs - and it's less than 5 dollars a day I believe. Total freedom: might actually end up taking a roadtrip to some other nearby countries, but who knows; everything is so chill here that it's pretty hard to leave!

There's one problem with this tek: those infernal bubbles that form and rise while boiling the OP+coke in the microwave.  I didn't like standing there for 10+ min turning the microwave on and off, over and over.  We DO NOT want the cup to runneth over!  

So, I got to thinking about something I could do to eliminate the foamy bubbly bullshit.  I remembered my high-school days of funneling beers, and using my finger to rub the side of my nose and putting the finger with the nose grease on it into the beer foam, in the funnel.  This dissolved the foam, so to speak.  Then I had an idea! 

So, I put 1 drop of cooking oil (any type will work) into my OP+coke solution, screwed the lid onto my Magic Bullet (the food processor not the sex toy) cup and began microwaving it.  Yes!  The bubbles only went halfway up the cup and stayed there, and I was able to just let it cook!  Within 4 min my OP pieces were clear and no foamy bubbles leaked out of the lid! :)",1537247587.0

No matter where we are in the world. They literally have zero clue about formulating drug policy. 

We (an Australian state) recently hosted the DEFQON 1 music festival. I‚Äôm not familiar with the specific sub culture, who attends etc, however there were apparently a rash of drug overdoses and the place was awash with drugs (keeping the cops very busy). 

Dozens of people in hospital. Two young people tragically passed away. 

The Premier (elected head of government in the state & member of parliament) is talking about cancelling the festival, disallowing similar events & is convening an ‚Äúexpert panel‚Äù to report on what can be done. 

The irony here is that we literally have government run HEROIN INJECTING ROOMS that supply free injecting supplies and medical staff on site with free Naloxone, alcohol swabs, syringes et al for all! 

Pill testing is being advocated by the vast majority of the community in an effort to facilitate harm minimisation. Yet with their monolithic and blimp mentality, the government is simply saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs. 

They‚Äôre illegal and you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs in them‚Äù. NO SHIT that‚Äôs why we need pill testing so our kids don‚Äôt fucking die! 

Still promoting abstinence. Still talking about the tragedy of losing young lives, yet they won‚Äôt permit simple measures that can help save those young lives that they‚Äôre allegedly so concerned about. 

You can literally cross a border here and the next state over actually provides government funded pill testing. No drug overdoses there! 

The press gallery are thankfully excoriating the government in a live press conference, but I just wanted a rant about how fucked up drug prohibition and policy is. 

A member of the fourth estate, asked a particularly incisive question:

 ‚Äúif people are overdosing on drugs, because they are illegal and thus made in suboptimal conditions, by criminals, with unknown and dangerous chemicals, and it‚Äôs those chemicals that are causing the deaths of our young people, why would you be opposed to testing that could inform their choice of whether to take it or not?‚Äù (paraphrasing).

Premier stammering and going red in the face ‚Äúdrugs are illegal so don‚Äôt take them‚Äù. 

Great job Gladys (yes our premiers name is Gladys).

Fuck me I hate politicians. They‚Äôre as thick as two short planks. They purport to represent the people, yet when the people say ‚Äúwe want decriminalised drugs and pill testing‚Äù they‚Äôd rather young people die. 

It‚Äôs frankly disgusting. 

Sorry for the rant, guys.

IF YOU ARE NOT CAUGHT UP TO S5E10, TURN BACK NOW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

First of all, this show is great. If you haven't seen it, check it out. It's on Netflix. It's basically about this Horse who was an actor in a famous 90's TV show called Horsin' Around. And now he's in his 50's and dealing with long-term depression. 

Well season 5 just came out yesterday and I'm loving it so far. It's gone in an even darker direction than the rest of the show. 

Well in this particular episode of season 5, he's taking opiate pills for his herniated disk that he got from messing up a stunt for his new show. And his sister flushes them down his sink because she thought he was trying to drug her. So they go on a search for more pills because he's ""in pain"". Later in this chase, they're being chased by the police, and he lifts his sister and himself over a fence in order to get away. Well once they get away, his sister points out that his back shouldn't be in pain if he was able to do that. He denies up and down that he's using them recreationally, and takes her to the airport so she can go back home. 

On the drive home, he stops at a red light, and picks up the empty pill bottle. He holds in up and looks inside, desperately hoping somehow there'll be another pill inside, then licks his finger and swirls it around the inside of the bottle. He starts jittering and sweating and looking around frantically, then speeds through the red light and gets into a massive car crash. The next episode starts off with him having several broken bones, and taking more pills. 

This is probably the realest, most accurate portrayal of addiction. I know people, personally, who have done something like that; hurting themselves to get painkillers. I, myself, have frantically and obsessively shaken my bottles upside down, hoping some nonexistent pill would fall out, licked my finger to try and get pill dust. I've been clean for 9 months, and this episode was very triggering for me.

Usually, I‚Äôm sitting in the church basement right now, listening to some old timer rattle on about how a person will stay sober all day if they don‚Äôt take the first drink or some newcomer talk about how he thinks he can smoke weed and still be sober. It‚Äôs always interesting to see the reactions it gets. Sometimes, I laugh at the way it all goes down. Sometimes, I cringe.

I‚Äôm not there for that tonight, though. No laughter. No cringe. No awkward exchanges at the meeting. No serenity prayer or seventh tradition. My whole life is off course. I‚Äôve derailed it. There was an obvious break in the track ahead, but I just went on at full steam, anyway. Didn‚Äôt do the things they say to do in N.A. and A.A. Never called my sponsor. Now, the first impacts are being felt, and soon my life will be a smoldering heap of twisted metal. I will lie. I will steal. I will use whoever I have to use to get my drugs. My days will dissipate like smoke. My bones will burn like embers in a fire. From the wreckage I will emerge as the monster that I am, the monster I have to be to feed my addiction.

Sounds melodramatic. I know. I‚Äôm just not sure how else to say it. What‚Äôs stranger about all of it is that even as I become as ruthless and ridiculous as I can become, even as I hurt people, I will long for love and approval and friendship. It‚Äôs hard to explain. It‚Äôs not rational, but neither is drug addiction. For now, though, the changes are subtler. Less severe in every way. For now, I‚Äôve only relapsed and lost my job. For now, I‚Äôve only missed my home meeting and failed to call Jerry like he asked. For now, I just have to get to my room without talking to Dale, if I can avoid it.

I do. The shower‚Äôs running when I get home, and the light in the bathroom is on. The door is shut. He is blowing his nose and hawking loogies in the shower. Dale is singing some old gospel hymn. My room is black and chilly when I get into it. I close the door and collapse onto my bed, pulling my shoes and socks off with my feet and letting them fall onto the floor in the dark. The heroin is wearing off, but residuals sit in my throat like an egg and in my stomach like a warm molten metal. My mind wanders. Life is a practical joke. I think to myself. One I don‚Äôt get. I remember the first time I realized that life seemed to be an inherently miserable and melancholy affair but was also somehow comical in its irony, even if it has never made me laugh.

In my earliest memories my mother has no face. Seriously. I know that‚Äôs weird, but that‚Äôs how it is when I think of what she was like during my childhood. The way I remember her renders the woman who gave birth to me as nothing more than her body from the neck down, whatever clothes she was wearing and accessories she carried or the way she smelled at any given moment, like at night when my dad used to read in his armchair under the lamp and she smoked cigarettes on the phone and laughed with ice cubes clanking in a glass of liquor. Those nights she is a lit cigarette and the sweet smell of mixed drink to me. But on this night, the one where I am bawling in my bed because everyone I know in the entire world is going to die, she wears a thin cotton gown. Sun spots on her chest and moles on her soft white arms. I can smell lavender and cold cream glycerin. There is a pink handled comb in her lap. She strokes my hair. To me, my mother speaks with the voice of God, but it is feminine and worn and glowing radiant light from behind the clouds hiding her face, the clouds my memory puts there for some reason. She whispers that I‚Äôm an ugly crier. She says my face is covered in red splotches and gets up to turn the lights off and leaves me in the dark.

The memory doesn‚Äôt end there. My father comes in an hour or so after her. He must hear me crying on the way to his bed, separate from my mother‚Äôs bed. So, he turns in at my room at the top of the stairs but leaves the lights off. The lamp in the hallway backlights his wild hair. His silhouette is identical to Albert Einstein‚Äôs. That is what I‚Äôm thinking even though I‚Äôm still crying, and he asks what‚Äôs wrong, and I tell him, and he throws his head back and laughs like it‚Äôs all some sick joke he‚Äôs in on and been waiting to see play out. He speaks again. The gleaming white calcium of his teeth makes me realize that under his skin and hair and fat and without all the soft tissue and blood, my own father is just a skull and skeleton talking to me. I distinctly remember thinking that, even as I am having this breakdown at five years old. The thought scares me. All he has to say about everyone dying, though, is that I‚Äôm going to die, too, but that only makes me bawl harder. He matches my crying with even louder laughter, sitting on my bed and his hand on my chest.

As sleep takes over in my room at Dale‚Äôs, the memory of my father changes into some strange mixture of Albert Einstein and Kurt Vonnegut, Jr and himself. Three in one. The images of that night at five years old melt into incoherent dreamworld silliness and visitations from nightmare beings who whisper. I have visions of evil in the dark, and everything is on fire. I‚Äôm a melodramatic person. What can I say? And if I am, it only makes sense that my sleep process is, too. Then, it is the black void of slumber for the rest of the night.

The front door bangs shut and sends a rattle through my bedroom windows.

Blinds are drawn. Grey morning light pushes through them. Dale‚Äôs Ford Explorer starts outside and drives off. I‚Äôve slept later than I have on a weekday since I‚Äôve lived here, and it gives me terrible anxiety. There‚Äôs also something about brain chemistry when you sedate it with something like heroin and remove the sedative, even just once. The brain‚Äôs natural energy and thought life feels unnatural and over stimulated. There‚Äôs a bit of crust in my eye like a giant bacon bit with sharp corners. Drool on my face is slimy and stinks. Splotches of white decorate my pillow case. My neck and shoulders ache.

Dale knows I‚Äôm not at work. That‚Äôs not good. It will require an explanation soon enough. Probably, anyway. It‚Äôs possible that it won‚Äôt, but if I do ever have to give him one, I‚Äôm going to lie. That‚Äôs just where it‚Äôs at now, and I don‚Äôt care. Calling Beth is the next item on the list of things to do.

My brain is on autopilot, like it has relegated all decisions to the parts of my brain inherited from our reptilian ancestors. Those parts are baser and more primitive and able to pick through the subconscious to determine what course of action is most profitable to feed itself. It makes decisions based on realizations I don‚Äôt even know that I have had. Beth hasn‚Äôt been to a meeting in a month. We‚Äôve only talked a few times over the last two. She‚Äôs relapsed.

The phone rings through to her voicemail. I call back. She answers and says that she‚Äôd come get me, but the baby is sleeping and can‚Äôt be woken up. I‚Äôll have to take the bus to see her.

I smoke Winston cigarettes.

They remind me of Ghostbuster‚Äôs, and that's why I like them. Now, Beth is sitting on the floor asking me for one. I pull it of my soft pack. I also like soft packs. They‚Äôre retro, kind of, at least to me, and she reaches up. Beth grabs the lighter on the scratched coffee table. It‚Äôs the one I helped her pull out of a dumpster last winter. There‚Äôs a Where‚Äôs Waldo book, a few rolling papers and a small pile of weed. She turns her head to light the cigarette, so she doesn‚Äôt set her hair on fire and asks me,

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know. Same old. Same old.‚Äù I laugh.

‚ÄúNah. This is not the same old, same old, Randy.‚Äù The banter of some old macho cowboy blares in black and white out of the TV on the wall.

‚ÄúAre you sure? Seems like it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm sure. What‚Äôs going on? I‚Äôm not tripping on you or nothing. You just don‚Äôt ever come over here on a Thursday morning. You have a job, remember? Or am I wrong about that?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say anything. Just smile.

‚ÄúGot fired?‚Äù She speaks sweetly. Her words are full of a certain sadness.

‚ÄúNo. Not exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you say?‚Äù She laughs a little.

‚ÄúIt was time to retire from my career as a valet. What? Don‚Äôt you think there‚Äôs a time to move on from something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But, usually, when someone moves on from something, they have something to move onto. Ya know?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly! What do you think I‚Äôm here for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. So. You moved onto me, have you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt see why not, baby.‚Äù I smile big. Our relationship has never been like that.

‚ÄúBaby? I‚Äôm not your baby. Besides. Gunter wouldn‚Äôt have it.‚Äù Gunter is her sugar daddy. He‚Äôs an old miser who immigrated over here as a kid but now pays her rent and bills in exchange for whenever he wants her companionship. It‚Äôs hard to think that they have sex, but I don‚Äôt know. Either way, he‚Äôs not possessive of her. A true sugar daddy.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs he gotta know about it?‚Äù I look up at one of her baby doll heads. Beth has a thing about decapitating baby dolls and painting them. It‚Äôs her artistic expression. At least, that‚Äôs what she says.

‚ÄúUm. This is his place. He‚Äôs gonna know if you live here. He comes by with groceries twice a week and has right to come in whenever he wants.‚Äù

It‚Äôs true. I can‚Äôt stay with her, and I know it. Her baby cries from the back room, and Beth runs to go get her. I haven‚Äôt seen the baby since Beth first had her and brought her to all the meetings for everyone to meet, like a piece of pink and grey ball of mashed up hamburger meat in a napkin that we all passed around. I always have a hard time knowing if I‚Äôm acting right in those situations.

Am I making the appropriate goo goo gaga sounds? Am I supposed to talk to it with words? Why would I? They are usually sleeping. Babies don‚Äôt understand anyway, but I‚Äôm always afraid of seeming inhuman. So, she comes back in with her daughter who has turned into an extremely selfish and irrationally angry monkey over the last ten months. The child pulls Beth‚Äôs hair and screams. She knocks things over and laughs. It seems like children always want to do the worst possible thing they can, like play with the chemicals under the sink or stick something in an electrical outlet or crush themselves by climbing on cabinets and pulling them down, but I‚Äôm not much different. I like poison and doing things that will probably get me killed too. For some of us, nothing ever changes.

I ask Beth if I can use her Facebook messenger to message someone. She hands her phone over. Sal is as easy to find as he said he would be. He comes right up and even responds to my text immediately. I text my number and wait on the couch for the call. There are six 20-dollar bills in my wallet. Sal‚Äôs got the fire.",1537219456.0

(And a long ass story from me),"Has anyone hid their use from their girlfriend/boyfriend? What problems did it cause? Did you end up telling them eventually? Has anyone kept using and never told them at all and had them never find out?

I apologize, but as always from your good friend Angry Chair, this post is probably gonna be longer than it needs to be, but I‚Äôd like to tell it all to someone and get it off my mind.

 I had a serious and pretty long term (at least for my young age at the time, about 2 years) relationship with a girl but we both had trust issues and many other issues and well, she was crazy. We both were I guess. We got too serious too young. We planned to get back together in the future after some time apart but after a couple days apart she missed me a lot and wanted to get back together really bad, but when I meant in the future I meant maybe a couple months or a year in the future, not a week. 
I moved on faster than I should have and started talking to other girls within a week after breaking up. I guess I was just glad to be free after being young and attached to one girl for so long. I made the mistake of getting serious with another girl in 2 months (big mistake).
Anyways I never used dope when I was with girl A. She was very controlling and would say she would break up with me if I started using hard drugs, and I agree it was very stupid that I stayed in that relationship and obeyed her rules but I guess it was good because my life didn‚Äôt spiral out of control until we split apart and I was free. I did coke behind her back sometimes but it was no big deal. 
I can‚Äôt remember if I tried dope once or twice while we were still together, but I do know I didn‚Äôt get actually into it until after we split. 

So I started talking to Girl B, and around this time I would use dope maybe once every week or so, sometimes a couple days in a row, sometimes going a few weeks without it (basically whenever I could find it I would do it.) I ended up overdosing in front of Girl B the morning after I made her my girlfriend when me, her, my best friend and her best friend (we were trying to get them to hook up) all stayed at my friends house for the night and drank and chilled and what not. I told her I ‚Äúthought it was coke‚Äù and got sold something else, and she found out it was dope but I told her it was an accident and that was the only time I had ever done it. So that scared me away from dope for a couple weeks but needless to say I started doing it again, but still not getting hooked. I would do it whenever I could find it cuz I just felt like I was a better version of myself when I was on it. Well one day came where I used a few more days in a row than I should have and woke up in withdrawal. (Not the first time, but i still wasn‚Äôt in an active addiction. I would feel kinda shitty for about 2 days and then be fine, find some dope again a few days to a week later and start it all over) it wasn‚Äôt terrible withdrawal but I was anxious, depressed, had the shits like a race horse and couldn‚Äôt eat for the life of me. This day just happens to be a day I promised girl B (who I was now dating at the time) that I would go to her nephews birthday party. Great. a kids birthday party while dopesick. I get through that day and throughout the rest of our probably 8 month relationship I get pretty into my dope use (but nowhere near where I am now) and she never finds out. I didn‚Äôt have a steady supply, it was basically random when I would be able to get dope so I would always be sick when we would go to parties or events or when she would wanna just hang out. It sucked. 

Few months down the road I realize that Girl B was just some girl I wanted to fuck and I truly belonged with Girl A, but she had found another boyfriend (of whom she is still with) and by this time hated my guts because she thinks I cheated on her when I didn‚Äôt. Wtf. (Young relationship drama lol) The tables turned and I started missing her a lot and basically stopped giving a fuck about Girl B but continued to date her for another couple months maybe, just because I was lonely I guess. How sad. Eventually I just break up with her because wtfs the point lol My relationship with girl B was a joke. 

It‚Äôs been about a year since me and girl B broke up. I am deeper into my addiction than ever before and I miss Girl A more than ever. I wish I got back together with her when she wanted to. I feel bad for Girl B for hiding my use from her after oding in front of her and staying with her when I knew I was still in love with Girl A, but girl b was honestly kind of a whore and wouldn‚Äôt have understood my dope use the way A would have. 

This went from a post about hiding use from your S.O to a novel-long vent about the past 3 years of my life. I apologize for the annoying and whiney bitchey post, but I guess I just needed to get it out. If you read the whole thing I really appreciate it. Anyway feel free to share your experiences with girlfriends (or boyfriends, whatever you‚Äôre into) and drug use. Feel free to share anything. Doesn‚Äôt matter what. And call me a pussy if you want, I could care less, just wanted to let my thoughts out somewhere as my friends/family would be no use because they wouldn‚Äôt understand. Hope everyone‚Äôs having a good day so far. Your friend, Angry.",1537208454.0

does the chase for tolerance ever end?

do you ever lose an opiate tolerance and if so how long does it take?

if i keep up this habbit of chasing this high how long do you think it might be before im physically addicted?

My wife was away from home over the weekend at her brothers... He had recently had a baby and my wife was there for delivery. 

She flew back in and got off the plane and couldn't even walk straight. My kids noticed it right away and started prodding her about it. I grabbed her arm and told them she was tired and got her to the car. 

When we got home, I took her upstairs and figured she would sleep it off (not the first time she has come home completly wasted, though it is rare), and I went downstairs. I got her bags from the car and put them inside. 

Then I heard the garage open and she went out to the car to ""get her bag"". In more than 10 years she's never gotten her own bag, she's always sent me to go get it. So I got suspicious... And i dumped her bag out. 

I found nicorette (which her mom chews all the time) and some chewing tobacco stuff which her mom also chews... And then I found a pill box of oxy from my uncle who is in the hospital. I called her mom to see if she asked my wife to hold any of her tobacco/gum and she said no. And I knew it wasn't an accident that she had oxy from my uncle. ""Why would I want that? What does it even do?""

After a long fight and argument when she was more coherent I just agreed it must have all been a mistake (I don't but I also don't think arguing will help anything). Her parents are worried now because I told them in an effort for some help on this, but they are the type of people who believe their daughter can do no wrong, so I wound up causing them drama for no reason, especially when they won't help. Question is.. What can I do?

I don't even drink so to me this is very strange to confront, I don't know how to catch her in the act and obviously I have thrown out everything I found. She won't admit she did anything and I kind of figure this was going to happen, because she doesn't want to shame her parents or me.

Yesterday i found a pill crusher and dilaudids in her purse. What do i do? How do I help her? (X-post),"My sister has struggled with pills for the past 5 or so years. It all started when she started hanging out with the wrong crowd, failed out of college, and later got a DUI. 

It's been 2 years since she last relapsed and her DUI. She works as a full time manager at a retail store and went back to school as well. I'm so proud of her and I let her know that. 

She's been acting very strange. She's been extremely jealous, anxious, sad, and needing my full attention constantly. Also she has been spacing out, pupils tiny, and her eyes have been going half shut with very long blinks. My dad is very suspicious but I haven't told him what I found yet. 

I went through her stuff yesterday and I found dilaudid, Xanax, a straw, and a pill crusher. I am so sad she's back on this and all I want her to do is get help and stop. I've been told that she looks up to me and I have the potential to turn this around. I've asked her twice now if she's doing anything and she promised me she hasn't (she lied). 

I'm not sure if I should full on confront her and tell her I found x, y, z, how do I help? Or I just wait and hope she stops on her own. I live 1500 miles away from my family and am unable to be there for her through this. I told my mom already since she lives with her. What do I do? Please help. 

 She's also been hanging around a bad crowd again. The people there do the same thing they did at 20 years old and they are 30 now. My sister needs out but she's an adult and I can't tell her what to do.. she's also been doing cocaine and drinking on everything I've mentioned above. I'm so scared she's going to lose her job and fail out again. 

She's made her friend know that she wants to stop but doesn't know how. She feels empty 24/7 and even worse without the drugs. This all started back again after she got surgery and was prescribed pain killers. She also has a ton of stress but I just don't know what to do. 

UPDATE: I confronted her. I told her how much I love her and I'm her for her. I also said I went through her things and was suspicious and I only did it because I was so concerned. She gave me the pills to throw away but kept two green hulks. She said she took them last night but I know she lied. I let her know I know she's lying and I hope she can make the right decisions. I won't ever see her as a failure because I know how hard this must be for her. I'm hanging out with her all day today and doing what she wants. 

She was also concerned about me telling my mom and said she will tell her when she's ready. I told my mom last night because she needs to know too. My sister lives with my mom and needs her support as well. I just hope I'm doing the right thing at this point ",1537188776.0

Every time I came it was on my way being middled there by a roommate or an ex - but it was always *her* doing the transaction. Many times in a car full of dudes it was everyone... Shamefully, including me, hitting on her when she ran out. I mean, who wouldn't? With a beautiful half Mexican, half italian face and a body built like a pocket rocket at 4 ft 9.... I'll let your imagination do the rest.

I always noticed her loyalty to her man. Cartel or not. Biggest kingpin in the area at the time or not. She was a sexy woman. She handled the most hands on of jobs. She ran into just about every guy who would ever want her. I noticed her loyalty. I kept watching. I shut my mouth.

""Do i know you?"" She said to me one day as my middle was inside the opulant five bedroom house she shared with her high ranking, cartel owner. ""No, im C's friend, but i dont think We've met."" Little did I know that within 10 days her big cartel kingpin would be facing 80 years up the road.

Little did she know that under the most dire circumstances, id wish that on *no one.* Little did I know the death threats to follow the next month of my life. She had no clue i lived 5 minutes away walking distance till the day she showed up after the raid.

I could go on about how I ended up falling in love with her to the point of a suicide pact. I could say that she wasnt a nymphomaniac almost to the point of a fault and she couldnt cook better than most five star restaurants. I could say that i had golds in my mouth as a latino and knew how to carry myself before i was with her for 3 years. But what's the use in flaggin u know?

Rest in peace my bear cub. Im more in shock 3 suicide attempts didn't bring us back together. I've had more women and money in the past 3 months than ive had my entire life. Remember when you always said ""if i die, you'll know whether guardian angels exist?"" Well now i know that they do. Just give me one that can buy me happiness.

Cuz that fentanyl should take names. But it doesnt. It's good they cremated you. At least i know they burned me with you.

Often times, doctors are ready to write you a prescription. One of their first choices for pain are opioids. The most common are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Codeine. Many get prescribed these for legitimate reasons, but some people game the system. The people looking for opioids for non-legitimate reasons often use them for depression, anxiety, and emotional numbness because of situations.

I‚Äôm first going to expose how easy they are to get. I went to the podiatrist, and after an operation, he gave me a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine. I knew this was a drug of abuse, so I only used them whenever I really needed them. I maybe took 5 out of the bottle of 30 over a span of months. I could‚Äôve easily gotten addicted to these, so that was the reason I used them as sparingly as possible.

The media has recently given us information on why opioids are so often being abused. They have made statements that they are being used by addicts for depression. I‚Äôve read that opioids have ¬®a general numbing effect on both the body and mind¬®. If you are going through rough patches of depression, it may seem like these drugs are perfect for you; they aren‚Äôt. ¬®Some addicts gain tolerance and need more and more¬®. This easily leads to an overdose, and ¬®you can overdose much more easily if you take opioids with alcohol¬®.

Mainstream media has also said that people use opioid painkillers to eradicate feelings of anxiety. Being that painkillers also numb emotions, people think it‚Äôs a good reason to take opioids. ¬®Any use other than using painkillers for pain is considered abuse¬®. Addiction can easily take over anybody, but people with anxiety that have access to opioids and also have no self-control, is a recipe for addiction. 

It‚Äôs scary how fast a doctor is to write you a prescription for opioids. ¬®Many people get addicted even if they are legitimately being used for pain¬®. On the other spectrum, there are the people who abuse them. Popular opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin are all too frequently being misused by people who have emotional problems. People suffering from anxiety and depression with open access to opioids are at ¬®high risk for addiction and dependence¬®. One last note, if you get hooked and run out, ¬®withdrawal is painful and could be deadly¬®.

That happened probably about 6 years ago and was in a back brace for a year straight. Im a very physically active individual and it hurt about Everytime I did something I used to enjoy doing, kayaking for just one example. Pain where I would barely leave the house anymore. Looked into CBD and what not because I'm not a fan of pills.  

So I moved to Colorado when I was 19 to get my mmj card to hopefully help start being able to do the things I love and it worked for the most part. I still can't do all the things I love because CBD only helps so much and it makes me sleepy as hell making me not even want to be active the reason I am even taking it! 

I found kratom and that has helped a little bit but half the time it doesn't help at all. It gives me the motivation to go hiking and rock climbing and helps counteract the CBD tiredness somewhat. But it's getting expensive taking CBD daily and not knowing if Ill even have the energy or pain relief to be able to go for my jog up the mountain that afternoon. 

I live in the outdoors in the Rocky mountains where I can go for a hike and climb in my back yard. I've been able to manage so far with that type of stuff and my self prescribed kratom and medicinal CBD..as much as I can, it still hurts. 

Well I just got a great job where I can actually work and not have to be sitting behind a desk all day but unfortunately this job has some lifting requirements, I lift 50-100 lb concentrators and repair and clean them. Oxygen concentrators like to help people breath and repair and lift liquid oxygen cylinders weigh sometimes 170lbs. I absolutely love my job, I have been there for 3 or 4 weeks now.

 But this last week we had a huge order for about 150 60lb concentrators I loaded into the back of our box truck. I'm not one to complain and able to shrug things off, I am probably the strongest guy in our warehouse of workers and can lift heavy things all day but this last week I took my kratom, my CBD, but I couldn't do it. I tried my hardest and did all the work but at the end of the day I was about to pass out from the pain in my lower back it hurt so bad. 

I'm not damaging my back because at night it feels fine just while im lifting the concentrators about every time my back is in excruciating pain. I absolutely love my job and Its extremely hard to find a good job here especially at my age I'm not about to give this up. But does anyone have any ideas to help me be able to be more physical without the pain? Ideas on what I can do in my situation? It's terrible being 22 and having back issues. Nobody at works know, I play it off like I'm not in pain. 

I take Aleve and what not as well and i don't even notice a difference, does this mean I need to take some sort of prescription pain killer that I've tried so hard to avoid but is it just unavoidable now under my circumstances? Should I see a doctor?

Going away to Boot Camp? That‚Äôs no where near a hard thought for me to fathom nor fear.
My wife having to wait to come with me? Slightly.

Coming off Suboxone, Klonopin & Valium? 
This is absolute hell for me.

Now I‚Äôm fearful that I‚Äôll not pass my drug test at meps.
My last Suboxone use was today 8mg with ‚Äútapering‚Äù days in between.
And my last dose of Klonopin was about 5-6 days ago roughly 2mg; my last dose of Valium was 4-5 days ago at 40mg.

Now I‚Äôve read that Benzodiazepines (such as the ones I‚Äôm on) can take 4-6 weeks to fully get ride of the
 *drug metabolites* to be able to pass a urine test. 
Now I don‚Äôt know how true or not that is but I‚Äôve been put on Ativan at the age 13, went on Valium a little over a year ago, and added Klonopin in less than a year ago.

Now the thought of losing my whole future to my past drug abuse to opioids/being on maintenance medication really, really scares the hell out of me.

Ended up having to stay in hospital for over a week because I'd aspirated so much spew that without constant supplementary oxygen I was in danger of hypoxia, I was on IV antibiotics and a constant drip of saline because I somehow had an acute kidney injury from dehydration (I was lying on the ground for almost four hours before I was found, I have no idea how I'm alive. Just lucky someone was in the house and heard the death rattle and came to check on me). I also managed to fuck my face up by lying on it for almost four hours, luckily it wasn't broken but I had a lot of soft tissue damage and my jaw swelled to the point where I couldn't even open my mouth wide enough to fit a sandwich in. It was incredibly painful and obviously the docs wouldn't give me anything stronger than paracetamol.

&#x200B;

Anyway, as soon as I got out of hospital I was back to smoking a gram of H a day. Did that for a few months, then a couple of months ago, on a whim, I went to my local needle exchange and got a goody bag. I'm deathly afraid of needles but it was scarily easy to jam the needle into the crook of my arm and from then on I was off to the races. (Please do not start injecting heroin on a whim, it is a lot easier than you think and once you get it good luck stopping)

&#x200B;

(Now we finally get to the point)

&#x200B;

So I'd been using the vein in the crook of both elbows (think it's called the medial something something vein), but I was starting to get a fair amount of scar tissue, to where it started worrying me because it was difficult to get the spike in, so I decided to hit the back of my hand. Obviously I missed and now I have a bump that's about 3cm in diameter and feels like I have a golf ball under my skin. It doesn't hurt, I've been to a doctor and shown them it and they said it looks OK right now but to keep an eye on it. That was last week though and there's been no improvement or worsening. I'm just worried it's going to get infected, which would suck because I've been clean for almost two weeks. Just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: missed a shot, 3cm raised, hard bump under skin, no pain. No improvement or worsening over a period of a few weeks. Should I worry about an abscess forming, and what can I do to help my body break down whatever it's trying to seal off?",1537140023.0

I took a few days off methadone mainly for a  bit of a tolerance break and this eased the hot and cold sweats and sick feelings really effectively.

I usually don't dream at all when using, but it seems to really be on the nights I am cutting back or trying to slow down.

As a kid I was always into sports - soccer, baseball, basketball.. and my family, esp my dad, was always so supportive. Had a few coaches along the way that were so incredible a few turned out being like family to me, as well as my parents. I never even stumbled onto pills until after I had graduated high school, right before college. Its been so many years now.. 8 or 9.. that its really become my life (as would be putting so much time into anything for a decade). Really been struggling lately to break it off for real and for good, even though I see it within reach - a decent car, saving money, I actually have pretty much come to 0 on my debts and bills. I need to just take that extra push and save all of a few of my paychecks and I will be right where I need to be.

So onto the point, I've been having these surreal, vivid dreams where I am very young, about 10, at a sports tournament.. but I can never seem to get the strength to even get past the pre-game talk I am so focused on trying to get dope so that I am able to play. The first one was an indoor soccer tournament and I was struggling so hard to get the money together it was pure panic and I woke up before being able to. Next, a basketball one where this time was waiting on a dealer that I woke up before he ever came. Now last night was a baseball tournament where, with a coach that is like a father to me, I gave up defeat admitting to him and my parents there that I needed help and couldn't do it anymore. But that to play in the tournament I just needed to get well right then and that I was so sick my body was dying.

It's crazy and drugs were never, ever on my radar until much longer in life.  But my body combining the good, younger days, with this devil I've been caught under for almost the past decade.

I got a little more itchy and more of a body high, and I felt a lot more positive. 30mg more and I already felt pretty high. My body was feeling really good, I was able to focus on   a game I was playing and music sounded pretty fucking good. Only on 90mg.

Highest I did was 120mg and that had me on my bed doing nothing but listening to music, whole body feeling just perfect. I remember trying to eat or drink and it all tasted shit I just wanted to relax. I also got itchy as fuck, but I didnt bother me.

&#x200B;

Does codeine effect me better than most, since a 100mg dose got me feeling like a bliss. Sleep was amazing too

I have never tried other opiates but I'm thinking of picking up some codeine pills :s",1537110032.0

Left my ex some time ago and we haven‚Äôt spoken much about anything for a year. Recently let him back into my life and see how completely addicted he has become. Carrying drugs and needles and spoons in his lunch box, doing meth just to wake up every morning, shooting up H at work idk how many times a day or night. Mixing it sometimes.. the ‚Äúgoofball‚Äù or whatever it‚Äôs called. I don‚Äôt know all of  it. He told me he‚Äôs overdosed 8 times. He acts like he did it on purpose. He says he knows how much he can handle and he wont overdose again. the first day I was with him was good but he got a little weird/paranoid. It scared me a little because the things he was saying was just so off and not like him. The second day he was in a great mood, talkative, loving. The third day I had to care for him 4+ hours during what I thought could end up as an overdose, I took care of him as well as I could. 

In the beginning, before we split, he had a severe alcohol problem. or so I thought but it was actually cocaine as well, I had no clue. It has apparently progressed to this. And continues worsening. 

I told him I can‚Äôt have him around as it is just too dangerous. I told him I love him. I told him I‚Äôll support him in any efforts he‚Äôd make for recovery and getting the help he needs and taking steps to go into rehab, etc. he said he‚Äôll go to rehab Monday. (tomorrow) I doubt he‚Äôs going to go, he said he can‚Äôt do inpatient. I didn‚Äôt ask him to go or anything but That‚Äôs what he said. He begged me not to leave him. I feel like he‚Äôs desperately reaching out for help but doesn‚Äôt want to quit. 

Last night he said that he has nothing else to live for so he doesn‚Äôt see the point in quitting. He said if he had his kids back then he‚Äôd quit. I told him how backwards that it is. He was using heroin for the little time while they were in his care anyways and he lost them for that reason. That‚Äôs just his addiction talking I know but it breaks my heart and I fear he will die soon. I‚Äôm very concerned but what else can I do. Nothing. It‚Äôs such a bummer. He was my best friend, the only man I have ever loved. He has a lot of potential. But I feel that he isn‚Äôt even a person anymore. Just an empty shell of what he used to be. 

He‚Äôs been using H for a year and he‚Äôs lost everything. His wife. Kids. House. All his money. A couple cars. His job. His freedom. He looks really sick. Everything is gone to the point where he is homeless and luckily now he‚Äôs at least able to sleep on a floor at a friends house and find a ride to work. Like at one point does anyone decide to quit? I am so scared that he‚Äôs going to die. He‚Äôs been at rock bottom for awhile. 

Anyways I just wanted to vent a little. I know this is the opiate group but I thought if anyone understood it would be you guys. I probably sound crazy or obsessed idk I‚Äôm just worried. Please delete if this kind of post isn‚Äôt welcome. I‚Äôm just going to continue to be here for him to talk to and I‚Äôll help him if i can but I don‚Äôt wanna get myself involved in this disastrous cycle he‚Äôs in. ",1537103105.0

TL:DR- Want to ask psych to up dose from 90 to 120 bars (max prescribed dose) per month and also an adderall prescription.  Should I ask for both at the same appointment? Or should I ask for one of those things at a time between two appointments? 

Background: Okay so I first started seeing this psych after multiple people I knew went to him and had success. First appt I walked out with a script for 90 2mg xanax a month. This was back in October of 2016. Over the time since then i had asked and he switched me to klonopin 6 mg/day and another time he switched me to Valium 30 mg/day at my request. When I asked to go back on xanax he in so many words said it‚Äôs 100% up to me which one I want and he didn‚Äôt care. So I went back on 90 bars a month back in February. Now I know he‚Äôs prescribed people adderall and xanax before but I don‚Äôt think they were prescribed as high a dose as I am. My reservations for asking to up my xanax dose are that it‚Äôs already pretty fucking high and 120 would be the max he could rx. My reservation for asking for adderall is I‚Äôm not confident he would go for it. Worst he could say is no but I‚Äôm wondering if I should ask for both an increase and the addy script in the same appt or if I should ask for one before the other and in what order. Honestly this doc is very liberal I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he prescribed oxy for neuropathy or some shit.

TLDR: My lifetime supply of fentanyl was lost in a freak accident and now I have to start subs which are only available daily in the methadone line at the pharmacy so my dear wife is sure to find out sooner or later, asking if I should tell her and more importantly the best way to do so if I must?

It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been troubling me a lot more than usual lately: I‚Äôm a secret addict. I apologize for the length of this post but as much as I appreciate people‚Äôs opinions and find the collective consciousness of this forum very helpful, I don‚Äôt think your opinion will be as helpful to me as it perhaps could be if it isn‚Äôt based on the right context and considerations so a little background is really required.

I went to seek help and told an addictions counsellor about my problem (quite a few months ago now)  but before that there was absolutely no one in the world (except for random people on the Internet like yourself who is currently reading this) that knew anything of my problem. I‚Äôve been opioid dependant off and on for 30 years but it‚Äôs gotten worse in the last couple of years and I‚Äôve been dependant 100% of the time in the last year. I used opioids to control depression on an as required basis for 30 years but 15 years ago when I was married it had been at least 10 years of nothing, no opioids or depression so I really thought I was done with it at the time. 

It‚Äôs almost a cliche that I ended up using heroin as a less expensive alternative to prescription medication and more recently when that became too expensive to be sustainable I started using pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. Several years ago my heroin started testing positive for fentanyl but I had no choice to use it (carefully). As I was using fentanyl anyways, even if I didn‚Äôt want to, it only made a certain amount of sense to investigate and learn if I could use it more directly. While far from ideal for my purposes it is better for me than heroin in so many ways and it is of course a lot less expensive than daily heroin (pennies per dose).

In the beginning (over 30 years ago) I was pretty naive and seriously believed I had the flu the first couple of times I got dope sick.  It was so long ago I don‚Äôt really remember now but I would remember having run out of what I needed and that just wasn‚Äôt the case because I remember those few times during which that happened very clearly. So I was dope sick and really had no idea, if I had only known I likely would have just dosed to abort the withdrawal syndrome but I hadn‚Äôt yet connected the dots (30 years ago) that I had become dependent, rather I had just stopped using by choice to see if my depression would return and coincidentally thought I got the flu at around the same time.

I‚Äôve never directly lied to my wife unless you count not telling her about my increasingly serious problem with opioid dependency as a lie or the fact that I suffered from depression some 10 years before we met but hadn‚Äôt had any trouble since as a lie which I know some people absolutely will. If she ever directly asked me in such a way that it was not possible to give her a truthful answer without lying I‚Äôm know I would tell her the truth. It was really difficult for this addictions counsellor to understand how I could have the problem for so long and no one knew but here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt get high, I just dose enough when I have to that sends my depression into full remission (almost as effective as a light switch) and then I would simply stop dosing, usually well before dependence developed.

I have some insight into how she might react to this (very badly) because not long after we were married (and before the depression returned) I had a problem with alcohol dependence (fortunately dependence and not addiction, there is a difference) which developed after my parents both died and I was stupidly using alcohol as a sleep aid. While this alcohol dependence was developing, my wife would never forget to prepare a rather stiff drink for me at bedtime, to help me sleep. She was as naive as I was about the danger. I would drink only at bedtime, wake up the next morning renewed and refreshed go off to work without fail.

Eventually one evening I came to my senses and resolved to stop doing this to my liver as the amount required to help me to sleep was ever increasing and clearly getting out of control but it was already too late, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I started to sweat and soon developed nausea, vomiting and a rapid heart beat.  Sitting in front of my computer at 4 or 5 AM (dial up modem Internet in those days) and trying to figure out what was wrong with me I researched my list of symptoms and ‚ÄúAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome‚Äù appeared on my monitor. I remember I sat there frozen and in a daze, staring at it for the better part of an hour before it sank in that this was likely what was wrong. The means to confirm my amateur diagnosis was pretty simple so I drank some gin and very soon felt much better. The next day I couldn‚Äôt believe how stupid I had been to allow this to progress so far. I researched how to fix it, obtained the required amount of valium (diazepam) to substitute for alcohol, created a spreadsheet with a taper protocol to dose a slowly decreasing amount of diazepam every 6 hours over the course of 7 days (5 was recommended as sufficient but I wanted to be sure) and had the serious talk with my wife as to what had happened and how we were going to fix it. She wanted me to go to inpatient detox but this was exactly what they would do for me there and I didn‚Äôt want the embarrassment of anyone else in the world knowing how badly I had screwed up or how stupid I had been.  I had lots of paid sick time at my job and anything less than 10 concurrent days didn‚Äôt require a medical certificate but I still used vacation time to do this as I didn‚Äôt feel I should be taking paid sick time to treat a self inflicted wound. I took a week off from work and she was a trooper, waking me up and giving me the medication I had self prescribed in strict accordance with the protocol over the next week. After it was over, I went to a good number of AA meetings at my wife‚Äôs request but I simply couldn‚Äôt relate to the people there, I wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic and had no urge to drink, rather I had just become alcohol dependant because of my ignorance and no longer was but my wife was absolutely terrified. Only after we went on a number of Caribbean vacations where all inclusive (already included or free) alcohol was excessively abundant and she noticed that I drank responsibly did she seem to stop worrying herself sick that I was an incurable alcoholic. 

A couple of years after we had put this behind us my depression returned which was obviously very disturbing to me but I knew what I could do about it and of course I did. Perhaps the relative ease at which I had put alcohol dependence behind me played a role here as well. Ok, not perhaps, it definitely did. I was still very naive and probably felt at the time that if I did become dependent on opioids I could simply replace it with something else or slowly taper down the dose and leave it behind me as easily as I did with alcohol and even as I had been able to do with opioids in the past but of course I was incredibly stupid and obviously very wrong, fentanyl is a quite a very different animal.

As I started to realize the amount of money I was spending I starting taking steps to bring that under control. I learned that I could dose a lot less and still not be depressed. I was able to make what I had last longer. Of course like anyone, my tolerance increased and eventually the pills got too expensive and like so many I turned to heroin. I remember one of my early experiences with the wonderful warm euphoria of heroin and thinking ""If this is all I ever get out of this life I might be fine with that"". I really didn‚Äôt get high very often. Sometimes I would go through several grams of heroin without getting high even once. Getting high wasn‚Äôt important to me -- having my life back was and I really found heroin too sedating. If I did push enough heroin to cause euphoria it was very short lived because all I wanted to do was to take a nap. I suppose if I hadn‚Äôt found heroin so sedating it really could have got me with a serious addiction but I really didn‚Äôt like it because of how tired it makes me feel. At some point all my new batches of heroin started testing positive for fentanyl. I really had no choice but to use them carefully and as I was using fentanyl even if I didn‚Äôt want to I started to investigate if it could be helpful directly. Eventually my tolerance increased and the heroin got too expensive so I started dosing pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. It was a lot less expensive than daily heroin. It also isn‚Äôt useful for getting high (perhaps some of the analogs are but not fentanyl itself) but just using it (without getting high) was sufficient to keep me singing with the radio and not depressed.

When I met with an addictions counsellor I found out to my great dismay that In order to get into the buprenorphine program I have to give up my job (because it requires me to be able to fly the friendly skies) and that‚Äôs a pretty big decision I can‚Äôt make without involving my wife but I know from past experience that she will react badly and be worried and terrified all over again and I‚Äôm really having a hard time bringing myself to do that to her.

In my country, suboxone is treated the same way as methadone with no difference. I will have to go to the same pharmacy every day for the remainder of my natural life. After three months I will be able to get two additional doses friday for use on the weekend but the strict monitored dosing and urine testing goes on forever. The program costs something like $40/day in my area which is $14,600/year and without a job that‚Äôs a lot of money. There is just no way I get to disappear everyday at the same time for very long before my wife figures it out or worse jumps to the entirely wrong conclusion (she is always encouraging me to ‚ÄúGet a Girlfriend‚Äù but just the same that‚Äôs only because she wants what is best for me and I really think she‚Äôd be hurt if she knew I actually had one).

I know that my tolerance for fentanyl is increasing because it does take more now to control the depression and I also have some pain (likely from opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and I don‚Äôt want to continue dosing fentanyl for years.  I have only a small supply remaining and it is rapidly getting harder and much more risky to obtain (really impossible, not for lack of trying). 

The Intervention

Handling and mixing pure fentanyl hydrochloride is very dangerous. The amount required to keep me well for a week is pretty hard to see and doesn‚Äôt look like much of anything with the naked eye. To make it safer and easier to handle and mix precisely, I had dissolved my entire inventory into an aqueous solution, 1 liter of bacteriostatic water mixed with fentanyl hydrochloride to a concentration of 5mg/ml, so that one bottle was just about 10,000 strong doses or really a lifetime supply. This was usually stored safely in a cabinet in my office, the one room my wife knows to leave be (she knows she can do as she pleases to the entire rest of the house) and there are no children in our home. I stupidly left it out on the counter for a short time after mixing the required amount for the next two weeks (every two weeks I reduce by 5% when I am tapering) because I got interrupted before I finished. The door to the office must not have latched completely and one of my wife‚Äôs cats got in and knocked it off the counter. In a freak accident, it landed mostly upside down. The problem wasn‚Äôt discovered for several hours and 98% of it leaked into the thick pile carpet where it was unretrievable. Obviously, I am the world's dumbest idiot for leaving it out and not making sure the cap was on more tightly. In any event, the lifetime supply had become a couple of months supply and that was a couple of months ago.  I have spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to replace it but that is simply not meant to be.

I have been coasting along the last couple of months, dosing fentanyl each and every day but never enough to get high and tapering as much as possible and I am becoming increasingly aware that this simply isn‚Äôt going to end well. I know I allowed this to happen and I have to accept the consequences but I‚Äôm feeling pretty trapped and don‚Äôt know what to do. I know if I tell my wife she will either leave me or she will dig in and help but I‚Äôm really not sure which way she will go on that. With each passing day it becomes a slightly bigger problem. 

I know when I run out it will not be pretty, although I have been tapering as quickly as I can, there simply isn‚Äôt enough left to complete a taper and even if there was it‚Äôs likely my depression will return at some point (it pretty much always does when I am in acute withdrawal).  Suboxone is a better solution for me (stronger kappa which is associated with depression or rather the lack of it) according to the last 20 studies I have read on the matter.

Knowing this disaster is coming real soon now I‚Äôm not going down because I was too embarrassed, proud, or stupid to ask for help so I went to my Doctor and told him what was up. He was shocked of course, and then became very distressed and withdrawn saying he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with it and referred me to the lady Doctor in change of the methadone program and I‚Äôm scheduled to start on that path next week. There is no heroin in my part of the world (just pills) and the stigma is so very strong here.

It‚Äôs a small town and as soon as I start standing in the methadone/suboxone line every morning she is going to know at some point. I know I can hold out for a while by picking a more distant pharmacy but it‚Äôs only a matter of time.  It‚Äôs easy to hide drug use when it has no effect on you (except the positive one of not having depression) but I can‚Äôt hide disappearing at the same time every day and not being able to travel for very long (the methadone Doctor said she‚Äôd call in prescriptions in distant cities for me but I simply don‚Äôt believe she can do that, I can‚Äôt even keep up with the travel schedule sometimes, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect her to be able to). We have two cars but I still think it is wise to pick one within walking distance just incase. I know it‚Äôs likely better if she hears it from me but I‚Äôm losing my mind with worry that she will divorce me.  

Do you think I should tell her or just try my best for as long as I can not to get caught?  If you think I should tell her any thoughts on how best to do it (thus the reason for this crazy long dissertation so you know all the machinations)?  She was really frightened with the alcohol incident and to her (never having even seen heroin in her lifetime) this is likely to be much much worse.

The only comfort I have is I know that the end of my life will end my addiction (and my depression).",1537078183.0

Let's talk drugs! I took a tuk tuk downtown and literally within 30 seconds I had a guy walk up to me and tell me he's got every drug under the sun. I bought a fat bag of weed and some black opium, they're quite nice to smoke together. I also got half a G of heroin, but quite overpriced (for here) at $50. Strong stuff though. I don't know if it was just that guy, or what. He says all the heroin has to be imported and blah blah blah. 

Anyways, I got all my supplies, and then ordered a large happy pizza to go. What is a happy pizza? Well, there are dozens of restaurants downtown that advertise ""happy"" food - which means they cook it with weed! Like, openly, advertising it on the signs and shit. I got my pizza extra extra happy - the taste was actually quite good as well.

The big mission today is to hit the pharmacies. Apparently everything is OTC and legal: codeine, vicoden, tramadol, etc etc etc. Let me know if you guys have any tips in that regard.

From a PDF on the Immodium site we find that lope is well absorbed orally but has an outlandish first pass metabolism rate above 90%.

That lope is not absorbed well because the pills have magnesium stearate in them? This makes no sense because this is a common binder is pills of all sorts.

That lope is only active in the intestines and doesn't really leave them. Huh?

So last night I went to a friend's house (we'll call him Aaron) to smoke my h, and he asked for a point and he'd get me back when he bought some today. Aaron needed needles too, so I brought over some today and he bought me a pack of cigarettes in exchange. Aaron asked for another point today, and so did his roommate (we'll just call him roommate). I told them call the d-boy and make sure I can get more bc I'll be out if I give y'all each a point. So Aaron called him and d-boy said yeah come through in 30. Roommate gave me cash for his point, and Aaron is supposed to give me 2 points out of his sack. Then Aaron gets stuck on the phone with his crazy ex, and once he gets off he says he just dropped acid. So I said ""bro wtf, I need to get my shit tonight."" And roommate told me ""you act like you'll go through withdrawal or some shit."" Like yeah, I will. He's tryna tell me that since I smoke it, withdrawal isn't a thing to me. And now since it's been 2 hours since Aaron called the d-boy, he's not answering. So I suggested let's go through my guy, and Aaron said fuck him, he's not getting my money. So I guess since they got what they wanted, fuck whatever I need. So now I'm out of dope, and they're concerned about a.) Tryna set up some nigga that just robbed them, and b.)

Note that shit daughter had a child of her own that he had to raise as his own from a young age. She is now an adult in her 20s and is serving in the navy. His good daughter that has done great most of her life was charged with selling some of her hydros to a girl she knew and apparently someone else sold a fent laced hydro 10 to the same girl and killed her. Both sellers were convicted of murder and had no bond. The trooper had to get a mortgage on his paid off house, empty all his savings to get a lawyer good enough to keep his good daughter from getting sentenced as she didnt sell the fake pills. 

So this state troopers has literally worked his entire life for NOTHING. He mopes around and for a man that use to be full of character is now basically dead.

So, I've been using Oxycodone (~ 200mg p.d) and generally add in a benzo (Temazepam/Diazepam/Flunitrazepam/Midazolam etc) or a gabapentinoid (Lyrica) if I want to get super chill. 

I've been using opiates/benzos/gabapentinoids and others recreationally for the past year and thoroughly enjoying my life üòä

One thing that I have never experienced is a nod. I hear people talk about this all the time but for me up until now, its never happened. 

Well, this morning I took 10mg Diazepam, 600mg Lyrica and 60mg Oxycodone, brewed myself some Blue Mountain and had a chill day. 

This evening, I had chosen a great Prime show to watch (Mr Robot), had pizza and then took my Saturday night dose.

So, 1,200mg Lyrica and 80mg Oxycodone down the hatch. (No benzo BTW, however I am aware that my morning dose of both Lyrica and Diazepam may still be active)

Well, I was watching the show with my sister and suddenly got a tap on the shoulder. 'youve missed most of the first episode?! lol)

Apparently, I had nodded off. I awoke half way through the second episode feeling great lol.

I am still feeling great now. I am very cautious when it comes to mixing benzos with opiates however less so with Lyrica.

I have once again been reminded of how wonderful Pregabalin is. I love it!

I jumped on it bc usually when I ask, he charges me double (we agreed on a mutual understanding that I‚Äôd buy him a bag if he could grab me one, because I don‚Äôt like going on the runs, so I have to trust that he comes back every time, and he always has so far. I think it‚Äôs fair - I‚Äôll buy you a bag if you can grab me one, right? Well then it somehow became $50 extra, than $100 extra, basically just pushing it as far as he can.) Usually when I grab a bag off him, I pay double + more. So anyway, back to the story... I sent him the $50, he came by, dropped the bag off, and then I start smelling it, doing it and mixing it up, and realize the dopes a little off perhaps? Now, this isn‚Äôt my usual dope from my normal guy. However, I have tried this dope once before. it looked the same pretty much but Idk, it just had a weird consistency in the spoon this time.

Did it once more and still same reaction - ‚Äúeh‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright.‚Äù Long story short - I‚Äôm wondering in the back of my head if it‚Äôs possible he put a little bit of baby powder or something in it to make it look like it‚Äôs more dope when it‚Äôs really not, ya know. I mean, why else would he be selling me a bag for $50 when usually he charges me double + some..?  I‚Äôm thinking, maybe he took some out for himself, mixed it with a little bit of baby powder, and sold me half or maybe less than half of a bag, and charged me $50. So for him, he‚Äôs basically making $50 off half a bag or less and then getting an actual hole bag for the same amount. Im very generous, but I‚Äôm even more skeptical.

I cant really find nothin‚Äô for ‚Äúwhat does baby powder mixed with dope look like?‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing on here either, I checked! or maybe I didn‚Äôt look hard enough. 

Either way, do you know what baby powder mixed with dope looks like? Or how can you tell if ur dope is mixed with baby powder, or something of the sort?

Went to the Dr's at 8 am on the Sunday, they checked me over and other than a low oxygen count he said I was fine and gave me some antibiotics, which I've saved for something useful(I get tonsillitis frequently). So this week I took the week off work to try and taper, costing a fortune in pay and feeling pretty bad about my poor attempy at stopping.

Today I decided to have a second attempt at it and I'm now getting that same chesty cough I had last week, I've got enough codeine to do a 50 % reduction over the week, back to work Monday no matter what. I feel stupid, I thought I was in control  and didn't do the smart thing and try a longer taper.

I know it's only codiene but I've not experienced this before, having done other drugs in my life, non have left me physically dependent like this, its quite amazing. 

I hope the chest thing is withdrawal and not something more serious, seems to be a lot of Tb coming to the UK from Asia etc. 


Good luck to all those quitting.

about 5 min ago I snorted 3 big lines each about  .2- .3 of some good/fire dope, it was mixed. 2 lines were fire and 1 was real good dope but not such potent as the other two. I also took 2mg of etizolam which is the same as 1mg of Alprazolam. Thats what I learned here together with a bropiate. And I just wanted to thank you guys for. Everytime I come here I learn smth new or read some super interesting atory from someones day. I am more than grateful.that I am at the moment whether addicted to dope or to benzos. Thanks detox, mom, brother, friends and you guys for helping me staying ""sober"" I know that I sometimes use at the moment but it gets less and less everyday. Yesterday I had some real cravings while getting drunk with my friends and I didnt touched the dope just because of you teaching me how to handle cravings. I must say that I touched that night dope and snorted a .1 line but that was just because something really bad halpend to my best girlfriend amd I knew that dope will help me to forget it and that I can sleep and work today. I worked today 8 hours cutting trees, builiding walls(German walls with stones, IDK as far as I knoe most of you are from the USA and as far as I know there are most of the walls, not all, are made out of wood) so one stone has a weight of ca. 4kg and I lifted about 150-170 of them today. I am really groogy. But this day was a day where I didnt thought once about using because of the work keeping my head focused. And I didnt wanted that risk again doing such things with dope. The last time I did that while actively using and broke my arm and foot. So this was a great day. And I gave myself some small treat after such a hard day of musclework. I found a way with the help of you to do smth against my cravings its riding my bicycle. Thats great you helped me so often in the last 2 years when I was using and I sometimes asked some real stupid questions just because I was so high. Becauae of you I didnt started shooting dope. I just wanted to give you all a super big hug and a very grateful thank you for caring about me, listing to me if smth bad happened, just for every little thing you have done. This is a great Community and I never met any ppl here who were harsh or disrespectful. Ok there were some assholes too but they just said it like it needed to be said. And some dumb trolls but who cares about them. I send to everyone of you much love and respect for beeing the wonderful persons you are. You guys are great never forget that. If anyone needs help please pm me and I will.answer you and help you. Stay as you are and never let anybody tell you that you are scum or shit just because you are using. Its andisease and if you are ready you can start to fight against it. I will try the chipper way now a bit. Lets see. Maybe I am one of the thousand ppl who wont get addicted again and if I get addicted again I found a great way for me how to stop using. If anyone is interested in my way of detox that worked for me now 3 great times. I was 3 month clean before I relapsed the maximum amount I was sober in the 2 years before was one week and that was only because my dopeman got arrested and I am or was to shy and scarred to cold cop. So if anyone ever needs help just hit me up and we can write about everything. Even my PTSD got much better aince I stopped using now. So enough from my emotional post. I just had to get that off of my heart. I love you guys and gals. Stay safe. Please try to always carry narcan and not use alone like me and tell the others where your naloxone is. Its a lifesaver. I will always remember my one and gladfully only OD and I was alone and thank god I came back on my own. Always do a test bump or test shot. You can always take more not less and every life matters. Have a great day/night whatever time it is at yours. I will post some updates how it works out for me as a chipper and at the moment when I realize I am coming to near to addiction or am addicted again I will definitly get sober again. Thats for sure. Oh and I will write a book about a junkie in my age and in my country cause you can nearly find nothing about addicts in my age from my country. Only from the oldtimer junkies from the Heroin Epidemic in the 80s untill late 90s. So now its really enough from me you got better things to do than read this super long text.

That is, unlike injections of cocaine which produced a very distinct ""taste"" (I believe technically that it's a smell, since they say we only taste salty sweet, bitter, sour, and ""umami"" [Japanese word denoting tee sensation produced by foods that Americans would call *savory*, eg a rich bone broth]  IIRC, and all other taste sensations supposedly actually come from the nose and the sense of smell), varying directly with the quality and amount of cocaine (a very strong gasoline type ""taste"" [ie smell], probably partially due to solvents used in production, but i am pretty sure cocaine itself has that solvent taste to it).

Heroin, on the other hand,  had no taste as far as i was concerned.i do not remember ever noting a taste,  even a faint one,  while shooting tar or ECP in the early to mid-2000s.

Today, i definitely taste the ECP I get. I cant really describe the taste, and its not vinegary even when i have the good stuff that reeks of it, but it is a definite taste every time it's good, real dope (fent cut almost certainly in these stamps, but still good heroin with it).

Also, I'm on low dose subs, praise Allah, and I taste the taste, and it's always there even if it's partially blocked in the brain.

Have I changed or is it the dope? Maybe it the fent I'm tasting? Maybe I discounted the taste when I was young because it's relatively weak compared to coke even if I did taste it.

Has anyone else developed a more keen sense for the taste of a shot of dope?",1537029902.0

Lol","So you guys may remember me, and my story about trying to produce a sperm sample while high on oxy, and then my descion to get clean from everything after my sperm results came back really bad from all of my drug and alcohol abuse over the years. 

Since me and my girlfriend have been trying to have a child, the doctor basically told me I needed to get clean to be able to have a chance at getting her pregnant because my sperm count was horrible and I only had around 0.7% of active sperm when regular males are around 4%.  So I did. I got clean from everything and it's been about 2.5 months. I had a few relapses on alcohol but I have stayed away from cocaine, opiates and I even quit a 10year marijuana habit as well. 

I feel great, I am currently in school right now for my final year of electrical so I will be a master electrician in about 2 months. 

Me and my girl have been trying for a child for just about 2 years now, and nothing has worked but I also had not gotten of drugs and alcohol prior to two months ago and I was a decently heavy user of oxy, with occasional heroin, drinking 4-6 days of the week all the time  and snorting coke every weekend for years.

She missed her period this month and sure enough, the test came back positive.

Although this is still very early in the pregnancy and anything can happen over the next few months, I'm proud of myself for actually getting clean, and getting clean actually worked for us to conceive. This gives me even more motivation to STAY clean to raise this child and hopefully the pregnancy goes smoothly. Just wanted to update you guys on the situation if anyone cared. You all gave me lots of helpful advice and words of motivation and I still message with a few of you on here that have had my back when I wanted to relapse on heroin and I am truly grateful for that. I'm excited to be a father, and to be a sober father unlike my alcoholic father. I want to be the best dad I can be and I can only do that if I'm sober. 

Thanks guys, stay safe.

so far I've been shooting the foam, is that bad?? Isnt it bad for air to be injected in your veins?

What I am trying to figure out before I go is, is the doctor going to turn me away if this is the case, or, will they see that I am really trying to do the right thing and help me?",1536972043.0

I've been doing a taper since Saturday 8/1.

Well I'm waiting to meet my dude and get the last sub for the schedule I had set up and he's been bullshiting me for 2 days. When I posted I was asking if the subs were just talking longer to wear off or if the taper lowered my tolerance because I didn't feel very many symptoms. Well I'm pretty sure it's a lowered tolerance thing because I haven't taken anything in 61 hours and while I feel really shitty, it's no where near the withdrawals I'm used to. I have chills, sweats, mild RLS (gabapentin kills it pretty much completely), dizzy, emotional issues, but no stomach problems, no cramps, the joint aches are minimal, my back doesn't hurt like hell, I'm fucking SHOCKED. How in the fuck did a 2 week taper lower my tolerance this much? Fuck it, I'm not gonna ask questions. When I get this last sub I'm just gonna take 1mg, then in 2 days take another 1mg, then I'm gonna make the jump guys, I was scared of the detox, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to tough it out at home, but now I'm 100% confident that I got this shit.",1536962768.0

His cheeks collapse around his teeth. The cherry ember glows orange and lights his face. He continues, but now, he speaks words made of smoke.

‚ÄúTwo years is an amazing feat, dude. Really, not many get there if you consider all the people who have ever tried to get sober. Almost none. Be proud of yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks. I am,‚Äù proud of what? I‚Äôm not sure. I just know it‚Äôs the right response.

‚ÄúCall me tomorrow. We really need to get that fifth step done. I wanna see what‚Äôs up with your fourth so far. Just let me in on what‚Äôs holding you up. Gotta work the steps man. It works if you work it. It won‚Äôt if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. I‚Äôll call you. Maybe we‚Äôll get some coffee. See ya. Thanks again, Jerry.‚Äù We hug. He walks off. A blond girl whose nose and chin almost touch follows him to his car. They have something between them.

Another guy I know from the meeting taps me on the shoulder. He says he has tickets for a Mariner‚Äôs game next weekend and wants to know if I‚Äôd be interested in going. I tell him yes. We exchange numbers and walk our separate ways. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not going to make it to the game or even see Jerry, tomorrow. Relapse is like suicide. If you really want to kill yourself, you don‚Äôt tell anyone. You don‚Äôt even let people know it‚Äôs a possibility. You just do it.

The house smiles like a Jack-O-Lantern with a crooked mouth in the dark.

It has four apartments. Two upstairs. Two downstairs. Ours is on the bottom left. Through the front door, the hallway smells like pot smoke. It comes from the neighbor girl‚Äôs place. Her laugh and the muffled voices of a man in her apartment make me wish I was inside of the apartment with her. OK Computer is playing, song six. Karma Police. *For a minute there, I lost myself. I lost myself.*

The lights are always off at our place. An orange blast of stove light reaches into the living room from the kitchen. Dale sits on the couch with a wet towel over his face. He‚Äôs my roommate. Actually, he‚Äôs my landlord, because he‚Äôs the one who has his name on the lease and only invited me to rent the room to help him pay rent.

‚ÄúRandy.‚Äù

‚ÄúDale. How‚Äôre ya?‚Äù

‚ÄúTerrible.‚Äù He removes the towel. His cheeks are swollen like he has them filled with air.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

He shakes his head. There is hesitation to explain. I imagine he‚Äôs embarrassed by whatever happened to get him into this situation.

‚ÄúTried to dye my beard last night. Company must have changed the formula. Bad allergic reaction.‚Äù Dale is gay. You wouldn‚Äôt know that, but he is.

‚ÄúWhoah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He holds the towel to his face and walks to the sink. He flings the spoon and milk ringed glass I left in the sink that morning at me. It shatters. He screams and curses. There are many unopened prescription bottles in medicine cabinet behind the bathroom mirror. They all have his and other names on them. Lithium. Depakote. Prozac. Celexa.  I never know when one of his episodes is coming on.

Dale wears a clean white t-shirt and shuffles a worn pair of close toed slippers across his afghan rugs. They are propped up on the end of the couch now. His head rests at the other. He grunts and exhales dramatically. I sweep up the glass with the broom and pan and clean the spoon before placing it in the dishwasher. It‚Äôs better when I‚Äôm in my room. He never bothers me there.

Once I hear his door closes for the night, I sneak out to the front steps for a smoke. Party lights blink in the neighbor‚Äôs window. Something‚Äôs playing but is softer now and unrecognizable. She‚Äôs probably having sex with whoever I heard laughing through the door earlier. I was nothing special to her. That‚Äôs okay, though. Neither is she. Well, that‚Äôs what I tell myself. I roll the cherry out of my cigarette and flick it toward the street. A raindrop falls on my forehead as I walk back in. I think of Jerry and the fourth step, then Sal and the relapse before I fall asleep.

Dale is up when I come into the kitchen to cook breakfast.

He holds another wet towel to his face and mutters in the dark of the living room and tells me he‚Äôs going to the hospital. I nod. He shows me his face. The red lumped cheeks have wept an oily mucus overnight now dried in a green crust on his skin. His mouth is puckered and small from the swelling.

‚ÄúYeah. Maybe they can give you a cortisone shot or at least some oral steroids to help with the allergic reaction.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù Dale says through his teeth.

The door shuts behind him, and he gets into his white Ford Explorer through the front window. I pour a cup of coffee and open the fridge to pull out the can of Spam from the morning before covered in tin foil and a diet Dr. Pepper. This has been my morning routine for months. Black coffee and diet Dr. Pepper while I fry up some Spam.

When I was a kid, we never ate it. Probably because it smells like dog food before it‚Äôs cooked, but someone fried it up one time and shared it with me at the halfway house I lived in right after rehab. I never looked back.

Maybe, it‚Äôs not healthy to eat so much Spam. I think to myself. A half can every morning. For a moment images of my own ballooned feet retaining water flip through my head while the grease pops in the pan. Then, I begin to tell myself a story. I call it, The Attack of the Spam Babies. It‚Äôs about the pandemic of parasitic creatures which evolved from sodium molecules and preservatives in the canned meat product. They incubate themselves like tiny bugs at first just under the host‚Äôs skin. A person might confuse them with blisters or mosquito bites for a while, but as they grow, the bumps get as big as grapefruit. Inside, malignant fetuses kick and turn the way babies do, but when they come to term, they crawl out of the human‚Äôs mouth and devour them like the giant, hybrid larvae of a wasp or botfly made of Spam. Everyone is infected. The world is being taken over by these creatures. It plays like a low budget, horror/sci-fi flick from the sixties in my mind.

Then, I think about my diet Dr. Pepper and wonder if drinking so much aspartame is as bad for me as they say. I looked it up once. According to the FDA and all peer reviewed studies, aspartame has no negative side effects unless it is consumed in impossibly large quantities. Also, people who have an ailment called phenylketonuria can have problems with it, but belief in aspartame being so unhealthy is believing that the FDA and several other organizations have conspired to falsify the results of the tests, that they are hiding the proof of detrimental side effects for a profit. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.

I‚Äôm no stranger to conspiracy theories. Dale fed me several the first few weeks I lived with him. He might be considered a rightwing nut job. I don‚Äôt know, but whatever he is, some of it rubbed off on me. When I called my mom and the old man she‚Äôs married to, I would tell them about Pizza Gate or the Kardashian family belonging to the illuminati and how Bruce Jenner‚Äôs transition to Caitlyn Jenner tied into all of that. It wasn‚Äôt that I believed it as much as I was just sharing the information.

They never appreciated it. My mom had already dragged the old man into paying for my psychotherapy sessions between the ages of 11 and 13. I went because I had become extremely antisocial. Anytime I found myself in a public setting or talking to someone, my mind would automatically blast me with visceral imaginations of whoever was talking to me while they sat on the toilet, like I could smell the way their guts digested their dinner and see their bowel movements in all its different consistencies, black and greasy silt or crumbled chunks of brown clay or painful strings of a slimy yellow snot. I could hear the wet plops and their red-faced groans. It was crippling.

After two years of therapy and 20,000 dollars later, it went away. I just grew out of it. Therapy did nothing. I told my mom and the old man what it was all about after that. They didn‚Äôt seem impressed. Years later, when I got out of rehab and started telling them about conspiracy theories over the phone they asked me where I got those ideas. My mom asked me if I wanted to go back to therapy. They wondered if it was just something newly sober addicts went through. I haven‚Äôt seen them since they sent me to live with my dad in the city at 15.

Oh, well. I think, chewing my spam now. My shirt is off. There is a paisley shaped blister of bubbled skin on my stomach where grease popped out of the pan yesterday and burned me. I press it with my thumb. Clear liquid leaks out of it and rolls through the hair above my belly button.

‚ÄúSpam Baby.‚Äù I whisper.

Leaves pop with fall of heavy rain drops in the tree out front.

It‚Äôs not raining. Not really. It‚Äôs not even drizzling, but the day is gray, and there are a few rain drops falling from the sky. I just don‚Äôt consider it raining. Others might. Other‚Äôs probably do, but one thing‚Äôs for certain. I need a raincoat with me in case it does start pouring.

The only raincoat I own is hiding somewhere. I pick through the piles of clothes on one side of my room and fling them against the opposite wall. It‚Äôs a form of sifting, and while it makes the room even messier than it was before, it does allow me to find things. Five minutes pass. I‚Äôm sweating and breathing hard. Finally, the yellow sleeve of my raincoat shows itself. It is sticking out from under a large plastic bin full of books I‚Äôve read. The creased jacket slides out from underneath the weight of the book bin with a pull of the sleeve. I tie it around my waist as I walk out the front door. It‚Äôs raining oustide, now.

Our neighbor‚Äôs dryer vent blows hot scents of fabric softener into the driveway. Her husband‚Äôs truck leaks motor oil and diesel onto the wet concrete, and I walk through smells of pine bark mulch and fresh raindrops falling in the dirt where their yard had to be dug up for a busted pipe. There is no movement or sound on our block but my footsteps on the asphalt in the pale morning light. At the corner, a man with a black bandaged hand and head gestures and jabs the air declaiming like some diseased prophet.  His eye wanders. It rambles wildly as if it is an autonomous organism with its own distinct intentions and preoccupations, an insect which has bore a hole in the man‚Äôs face and made it its home. He yells at me as I pass.

‚ÄúYou have been called, boy! You have been called, but you have not answered! Your time is up. This day will be your death. Hell has place for you yet! Yes! It has place for you yet!‚Äù

Fear rolls through my biceps and the insides of my wrists. The fear is that this strange encounter might turn into a physical altercation. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt him. More than that, though, I don‚Äôt want to get hurt or infected with whatever he might have.

He‚Äôs crazy. I tell myself. Crazy or not, the words hit me hard. I know exactly what he‚Äôs talking about. It‚Äôs as if his crazy rambling is not crazy at all but actually the emission of some eternal and infinite intelligence warning me away from the path I‚Äôm taking. This is the first time I‚Äôve thought about Sal and the gift he‚Äôll be giving me shortly on the train, if he comes through and if I see him. The decision is death, and I know it. The decision is death, and it‚Äôs one I make willfully.

The train ride is cold.

The rain has moistened my shirt and pants enough that the cool insides of Sounder car are miserable. I stare at a mother and her son in the seat across from me. He is a grown man but can‚Äôt take care of himself. His face looks to have been smashed by the orifice that squeezed it out decades prior to today. The chin and head are small. Primitive eyebrow ridges call back to the rim of the cratered rock which held the fabled primordial soup, the accidental slop from which all life crawled forth. He spits a chunk of half chewed bread at the window. Strands of saliva stick from his mouth to the glass. He laughs, and his mother coos and clucks rubbing his shoulders like a momma bird soothing her babies in the nest. The scene has made me sick and angry this morning. I decide then that his life is the argument for eugenics and maybe, I‚Äôm not as opposed to it as I thought.

Someone slaps my shoulder. It‚Äôs Sal. He is shooing me over making sweeping gestures away from himself with the backs of his hands. I scoot over.

‚ÄúSah?‚Äù He says and swings into the seat. It‚Äôs funny to him to say it so absurdly.

‚ÄúSup, bro?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean to, but I am rubbing my hands.

‚ÄúBro! Put your tongue back in your mouth! Haha! You‚Äôre looking like a fiend.‚Äù I don‚Äôt appreciate his comment, but he‚Äôs right. Besides that, he‚Äôs got the power over me this morning in a baggie in his pocket or wherever he‚Äôs holding it. ‚ÄúHow ya going to do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù

‚ÄúBro. I haven‚Äôt thought that far. I‚Äôm just going to see it for now. I‚Äôll decide how when I get there.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what?‚Äù He laughs.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?‚Äù He laughs again.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù I turn away and look out the window. The sky is black. Everything is wet and getting wetter.

‚ÄúAight. Aight. Here you go, man. Don‚Äôt throw a fit, huh?‚Äù He reaches down and tugs on the cuff of his jeans. There‚Äôs a square fold of paper in his sock. Sal pulls it out. ‚ÄúYou know, I ain‚Äôt really one for lying, and I ain‚Äôt really one for giving out stuff for free. I was thinking all last night that I should just make you pay for it.‚Äù He holds it out. I reach for it, and he pulls it back from me. Sal hands it to me.

I unfold the piece of paper. Inside, there is a wax baggie. It is stamped with the letters D.O.A. in black ink. This is the kind of packaging I have seen pictures of and heard about from a couple I lived with in New Mexico in my twenties. They were from Atlantic City and told stories of the girl turning tricks for tourists she met on the boardwalk. They bought bundles, which were supposed to be ten bags, but they got 11 from their dealer. I always wanted to see what they were talking about and try it. Here it was right in front of me.

‚ÄúD.O.A?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúDead on arrival.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like there‚Äôs barely anything in there.‚Äù I am accustomed to dime and even nickel sized boogers of black goo stuck to square cut pieces of trash bag in a balloon.

‚ÄúYeah, man. That‚Äôs what I was asking how you‚Äôre gonna do it for. This stuff should be deadly. Better than anything you‚Äôve ever tried.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah. You said it‚Äôs of a brick a bunch of Vietnamese dudes had in an apartment. I mean. They probably don‚Äôt get their stuff from some dude of the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. They don‚Äôt. They said they get it from an old man. I‚Äôm guessing some family or something from back east. I don‚Äôt really know, but they ain‚Äôt playing around. That‚Äôs for sure. Barely speak English, man.‚Äù

I nod. We sit in silence a moment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm prolly gonna snort it. I don‚Äôt have a rig.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúGet at me, if you want more.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúFacebook.‚Äù

‚ÄúFacebook? I don‚Äôt have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt have Facebook?‚Äù

A number of paranoid thoughts enter my mind. Government surveillance and information collection are thoughts for a second. My drug use. My criminal history. Things like that. ‚ÄúMe. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude. A lot of reasons.‚Äù I raise my voice. The mother of the disabled son raises her scarfed head to look. Sal and I have been very quiet up to now. ‚ÄúI had it for a few months after I got sober. Made friends with all the people I went to high school with. They‚Äôre all doctors and lawyers and have children. I‚Äôm living in the back of some psychopath‚Äôs apartment paying way too much money with a crappy job and just got sober at 32. I got tired of reading about lonely old ladies‚Äô urinary tract infections and body image issues. You know? I knew them from N.A. and A.A. It was like, why are you posting about this? It looks pathetic. Just like when people post their sad dinner pictures. Are you really that sad and lonely? Are you really posting a picture of the salad you just made and the crusty tortilla you‚Äôre about to eat? Wow! I don‚Äôt care. A bunch of political propaganda and warnings of supposed pedophile rings using certain ads to lure their victims and all that crap. My mom‚Äôs sister-in-law and this crazy hippie chick I met at C.A. meeting once went off, bro, I mean they WENT OFF on each other on one of my posts, arguing about breastfeeding in public and whether that‚Äôs acceptable. Dude, my post had nothing to do with that. It‚Äôs just like it‚Äôs a place where people freak out on each other over nothing or make public announcements about how they‚Äôre freaking insane or sad and lonely.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù  He turns his head to the side as if thinking. His bottom lip is pushed up.

‚ÄúAnd get this, yo. Get this! You know what the worst part was, Sal? Guess. Just guess. It was that I was doing all of these same things. Me, bro! I had to get rid of it.‚Äù I am screaming. Another passenger laughs at what I‚Äôm saying. Sal holds his hands out.

‚ÄúAight, bro. Aight. Calm down. Man. You‚Äôre tripping out on me. Making a scene.‚Äù He laughs a little. ‚ÄúBut, look, check it out. I need you to get a hold of me. Search for Sal Emmanuel Garcia. I‚Äôm the only on in this city on Facebook with that name. I‚Äôll come right up. Just make an account and get at me. Remember, I just gave that to you so you can tell me what‚Äôs up with it. I already know it‚Äôs fire, but you gotta keep your end, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Sal Emmanuel Garcia. Got it.‚Äù

He rides with me for another few stops. We bump knuckles, and he gets off. I look at the baggie once more before folding it back up in the paper and sliding it into the breast pocket of my raincoat. My clothes have dried some. The heater must be on in the car. It‚Äôs warmer. I get off in a few stops.

I valet park cars in a garage at one of the hotels downtown.

My boss is a large Samoan with a thyroid gland that is currently trying to kill him by leading his entire endocrine system and vital organs in full blown mutiny against him. He speaks like Eeyore and wears the same khaki pants and blue collared shirt as I do for my uniform. We talk about his divorce and how that‚Äôs going.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still living with me though. It‚Äôs awkward.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah. Didn‚Äôt you say she‚Äôs sleeping with someone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he sleeping with her at your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Dude, you should have more respect for yourself than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love her, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. But that‚Äôs not the same thing as having to disrespect yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to explain. She is struggling financially.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

I turn away from him and lean onto the valet kiosk. The things he‚Äôs just told me disgust me. Everything about him is ridiculous. The way he talks. His depression. The way he lets his ex-wife use him. I have moved the baggie from the folded piece of paper into my pants pocket and finger it from time to time. A customer walks up. I write the ticket and take the keys. I park the car. I wait at our desk and do it again when the next one comes. Finally, it‚Äôs a quarter past four. If I walk back to the desk slowly, this old lady handing me her keys will be the last one for the day.

The inside smells like expensive perfume and new car. It is basically a Toyota Landcruiser, but Lexus‚Äôs 2016 version of it with leather interior and beautiful woodgrain panels. Everything is automatic. It has all the bells and whistles. The gold emblem in the steering wheel represents a world of things I don‚Äôt understand and never will. My mom does. The old man she‚Äôs with buys them for her.

I find a dark corner of level three in the garage. It is quiet. No one is around. I pop open the center console and find an owner‚Äôs manual in it. The wax baggie is flimsy in my fingers but stiffens enough when I press the sides to open its mouth. Fuzzy granules fall onto the glossy cover. I can barely see what‚Äôs there in the dark.

The dope quality had been going down for months and i was thinking of quitting due to the fact i couldn't find any real good heroin. Then one day i sniffed a 4 bags and within 20 minutes my heart was RACING. literally close to 300 bpm a minute. My entire body was shaking violently and my vision was blurred to fuck due to my eyeballs shaking too. i told myself if i didn't get better in an hour i would call 911. I was utterly terrified. It did go away in an hour and i was ok.

I have come to the conclusion it was heroin cut with clenbuterol mainly due to this article [http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html](http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html)

It scared me off dope for well over 2 year and now i cant use without worrying about this. Has anyone else come across this? also my buddy who smokes it did not notice these effects. It seems it has to be sniffed or shot. 

The heroin also tasted floral but also bad. kinda like rotten flowers

horrifying. 

any one else have the misfortune of getting this stuff?

I want to thank you all for giving me insight and helping with my questions.

I ended up going cold turkey starting Monday morning this week.

I took clonidine .2mg and 6 loperamide 2mg 4x a day for the first 2 days, then clonidine 3x a day with 4 loperamide on Wednesday. 

On Thursday morning, I took one last clonidine and that was it. 

I slept a LOT.  I was exhausted (I think because of the clonidine), and the dry mouth from the medication was the absolute worst.

But today, I woke up with energy and a new outlook on my future.  I FEEL FUCKING GREAT!

I don't know if I am the norm, but I feel very fortunate that I didn't feel any of the withdrawals like I did years ago when I tried to quit.  I think on Wednesday night I had about an hour in the late night where my legs felt restless, but besides that I didn't cough, sneeze, no runny nose, no yawning, no aching, no headache.  Just tired, and again, I think that was the clonidine.

I am sure that the positive desire to be done with this is also a factor in how I feel.  I have NO DESIRE at all to go back to the way things were.  It was such a wonderful feeling to wake up this morning at 7AM and I was alert and ready to go.  I can't count how long it has been that I would wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed, just to get out to the garage where I kept my stash of pills so I could get one in my system and feel I could then start the day.

I find that I unconciously still touch my pocket to check to make sure I have a pill there for my day.  I am guessing that that muscle memory will take some time to break, but it sure is great to know that I can take off my pants and not constantly worry that I may have left a pill in there for my wife to find, or, God forbid, a pill falls out of my pocket on the ground for others to see and question.

THE LIE IS OVER!  And I am really looking forward to the new me.

Thank you all again, I will probably still lurk here, and if I can be a strength and help to others, that would be the least I can do.

For those of you out there that are ready.  YOU CAN DO THIS!  Have the positive mental attitude and if you want, use my mantra:

*better every day*

God Bless you all.  And thank you again.",1536940112.0

I decided to hit in the crook of my arm- you know, the inside of the elbow. I don't hit there often, thus that is where my vein Old Faithful lies. I insert the needle, register and everything seems to be going fine. I'm in the vein, no issues yet.

When I pushed the plunger in it felt like I injected fire into my veins. It shot all the way up my forearm and into my hand. I quickly pulled the needle out and started rubbing my burning itchy arm. 

What happened next convinced me my arm was going to need to be lopped off. My forearm, wrist and hand swelled. My hand was the worse. It swelled 3-4times its original size. I couldn't make a fist and the skin was pulled so tight it felt like it was going to rip open. 

What happened? Any ideas? Has this ever happened to anyone else? After 2-3 days my hand went back to normal. I didn't seek medical advice because after a couple of hours the swelling started to go down. It looked almost like an allergic reaction.- like a giant hive.

I'm not allergic to the dope though bc I've shot it before in other veins without an adverse reaction. 

So, any ideas on what happened would be interesting to hear.

TL;DR Did shot, felt like my arm was on fire, hand swelled to giant proportions.

It‚Äôs creeping up on the 6 month mark since I quit a very heavy pharma habit. (90mg-300mg Oxy IR per day switched over to a 200mg-400mg per day Morphine habit due to availability and pricing). It feels great to not wake up sick.. and not think about pills every fucking waking moment... this is kind‚Äôve a shit post / update, but really I just wanted to check in and provide some reflections. 

The following are the 3 main reasons why I feel I hopped the opiate train at the perfect time: 

1.) I had switched from Oxy to Morphine due to price and availability of Oxy in my area. 2 months into my quit, my Morphine plug (a 60+ year old cancer patient) passed away. This guy had unlimited morphine at literal unbeaten prices, was always, always home. So that tragedy occurring, undoubtedly was a big factor in preventing my relapse. RIP Unc <3 

2.) The main plug for Oxy in my small town (has been main guy around here for 10 years and running) just got his house raided Sunday, and booked Monday for possessing 2 handguns (1 coming up stolen) with a felony, as well as several other charges. So he‚Äôll be gone for a good while. 

3.) When I was using heavy, I maybe encountered 30 fent presses maybe 2 times in my years of use. Now, everyone I talk to, it seems to be the ONLY blues that are flooding the streets. I‚Äôm not saying real blues aren‚Äôt obtainable, but I know (at least my area) the presses are more common than real deal blues 10 times to 1. FENTANYL EVERYWHERE. 

At this point, even if I wanted to relapse, I literally have no idea where I‚Äôd even look. Besides dark web, which I‚Äôm too old school for. Or cold copping shitty fenty dope in the inner city, which I‚Äôve never done dope, and never will. Watched 5 really good friends die, and many others in and out of jail/rehab. So just not my thing. I make great money and could always support my pharma habit. 

 So yeah, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm glad I have released the demon. It‚Äôs nice looking through the window from the other side. I have a lot of love and respect for (mostly) everyone  and I wish everyone nothing but the utmost success in whatever goals are currently in their sights. Much love, opiate family.

Zero tolerance for the opiates, but I have a pretty damn decent tolerance to benzos. I don't use very often, but whenever I do 4-6mg at once is the sweet spot and I usually end up doing 8-9mg before the day is out with little consequence. Memory is always a bit foggy but never full blackout unless I end up doing more than 15 or so mg. How bad of an idea is this? After I get a feel for the oxymorphone I was thinking of adding 2mg of alpraz to the mix.


Edit: Yeah this shit is overblown as hell. Ended up doing like ~20mg of Opana today, like 6mg xan, and about 1500 soma. I have a lot of experience with benzos so take it as you will, but honestly just feel it out and if you aint too fuckt after the first dose hits add on what you will. Just give each new dose time to kick in so you can feel it out.

Edit2: Soma is fne but for gods sake take it easy on the xan, for the tolerance described in my post i would recommend no mpre than 2mg. There wasn't much respiratory depressiom but i did emd up blacking out",1536905394.0
9fpg51,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9fpg51/my_most_successful_hustle/,17,https://redd.it/9fpg51,er1cl,My most successful hustle,"The post asking about hustles earlier inspired me to share this experience with you guys. I hesitate to call this hustle a success and if you read this wall of text you'll see why. When I need extra cash I look for odd jobs on Craigslist. My favorite are those that say pay is negotiable. It turns out I'm a stellar salesman and I can get good money for an easy job most of the time. Last week an ad for cleaning with a negotiable pay caught my eye and I met with an old women who needed a whole house cleaned. She said she'd pay me per hour for as long as it took.

Easy money right?

She told me her kid lived in the house and made a big mess. The price is negotiable because her kid was a ""drug user"" and she was positive there were drugs or needles inside. She wanted to be upfront about the safety risk so she was willing to pay more. My junkie brain was thinking what a score not only will I get paid hella cash for cleaning a house but I might find dope.

We agreed on $50 an hour and I started.

I'm not judging anyone for being messy especially when they're strung out. Who can be fucked to clean for free right? I understand, I really do. But fuck man, this was something else. Let me paint a vague picture for you. You guys know wd shits right? Well the toilets in this house had years worth of ass sludge crusted in and around them. I think the porcelain was starting to erode from the constant stream of acidic shits hitting the surface. The fridge was left cracked and the whole inside was molded: green mold, grey mold, foamy mold, I've seen it all. I think if it was left any longer mushrooms would start growing there. The cabinets were brimming with mouse shit, every corner of every room had cobwebs, I needed a face mask to dust. I thought cleaning a house would take me 4 hours but it took me 8. JJ didn't bless me with a stray bag either so by hour 6 I was starting to feel WDs myself. At one point I just finished cleaning the floor and then lost my lunch after smelling the fridge and had to start again. I felt like I was a contestant on a fucked up reality show:

""Junkies Cleaning up After Other Junkies"" idfk

At the end of the day I said sorry to the woman for taking longer than I first guessed but she didn't care. She thought I underestimated the mess to begin with. Then the woman starts crying. She tells me I'm an angel because she couldn't go into the house after her son died in it and didn't know what to do. I start crying too because it hit too close to home. She took that as an invitation to keep talking. My next two hours were spent listening to the woman that reminds me too much of my own mom crying her eyes out about her kid who od'ed.

and I was crying with her.

The successful part is that she paid me for the 8 hours cleaning and the 2 hours talking at $50 an hour. I made $500 for a days work which was a score but fuck me if I ever have to do that again. ",1536903553.0

at the moment I am some sort of chipper amd this time it really works. I ruined my piss test today but otherwise I know what I can tell my Psychologist why I took what I took. The next one is in about 1 or 2 month so I can consume now again.Yay. So atm I rail some lines ams then Inthrow in 20mg of Etizolam. IDK hoe strong it is compared to Diazepam for example. I cant find amything on google too. Its like google deleted everything about drugs. And bing dont work at my phone. IDK why. So maybe you can help me. Its for.relaxing and sleeping. I mean yeah I am really high but IDK if its just from the fire dope or from the fire dope.mixed with etiz. I started to enjoy benzos now. Since I cant use dope.daily anymore. Sadly and good cause otherwise I will be dead im some years and thats not what I want for.me or my family. I lost my dad 2. years ago and I know how hard that was. And I dont want that my mom and bro have to go through that shit again. So which benzos do you take? Also which do you mix with dope? I really like Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Etizolam, oh and I would love to test some rohypnol (flunitrazepam) but thats hard to find. I can get blistered benzos very cheap ans I know that not the right sub for this but r/Benzodiazepins is a joke... so maybe some of you could help me out. I am thankfull for every tip i dont care if its a tip for mixing dope and benzos or sedating benzos oh yeah I mostly enjoy the sedating benzos..Amd I dont take like 10 and black out the maximum are 2 or 3 over the day and max for one week and then I wait a few days so I wont get addicted to them they ahould just help me through my shitty job so I can go there the last few month untill I can get out of there and find a new one. Oh amd the etiz start kicking in now cause Instart nodding from about 100mg of dope nasal plus 20mg of Etiz. So yeah thanks im advance guys. And I will see a psychatrist in the next month who will hopefully give me a script for benzos too against my anxiety ans panic attacks. So thanks in advance fam. Stay safe and please dont write that mixing opis and benzos is risky. I always know that but I will do it. You cant change that. I cant change your habbits too. So love you fam. Stay safe and rememver to have narcan or call 911 for help. Every life matters. I lost 1 friend 2 weeks ago to an OD cause the assholes who were with him just threw him out of the house on the street and then called 911 and it was already to late. They were concerned cause they had paraphenelia. No drugs in the apartment. Such bastards. But karama will catch these assholes too. You can always do more not less so do a test bump/shot before you do your normal dose. I forgot that a week ago too and then I started nodding hard at work and my coworker came over to look for me and I stood up and collapsed and fell dowm and was out forinute or two she carred about me and I told her that it must be my meds and that I am ok. So since then everytime I got new stuff I do a teat bump and if I mix benzos and dope I just do half my dope dose because of the benzos. So enough from my high talking machine. Stay safe. And give me some tips for good benzos and please no RC benzos. Thanks im advance again fam. ",1536869759.0

Day 1 I waited 26 hours and I was fucking dying). My question is if this is my tolerance getting lowered a lot, or just the subs taking longer to wear off? I didn't expect a taper to do much after less than 2 weeks, if this I lower tolerance I might just tell the plug to stick the sub up his ass for telling me ""I got you"" when I asked last night, then ghosting me all night and today.",1536866208.0
9fkf8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9fkf8p/codeine_bloatingstomach_issues/,5,https://redd.it/9fkf8p,tilet,Codeine + bloating/stomach issues,"Hi all :)

I‚Äôve been addicted to codeine kinda full-on for 2 years now. At one point I was on around 400-500mg doses (in one go, every night) but now I cap it to 300mg. Long story short, 2 months ago I developed GERD (basically like acid reflux but worse I think) and I take Zantac/ranitidine and things like ginger tea to help when it hurts after taking my dose.

Recently I‚Äôve been getting a horrible feeling of bloating and dizziness, but not every single time I take my dose. It got so bad the other night I thought I was going to pass out from the dizziness and I was certain I was going into anaphylactic shock because I didn‚Äôt take my normal promethazine pill to counteract the itching (instead certrizine this time).

Does anyone have experience with similar side-effects? I understand things like this might be localised to codeine and not other opiates/opioids. The GERD IS probably due to the fact I ALWAYS took it on an empty stomach to maximise effects until I started getting these symptoms. 

Thanks guys, stay safe :)

Earlier this year I came home from my grandmothers funeral, still in my suit to find my wife of 10 years deceased on the couch from an apparent overdose on Pain Medication.   


Addiction has ran in her family forever, through out entire marriage it has been an on-going battle for her to try to control. She has had multiple accidental overdoses through the years and we were lucky that I was always there to save her and get her help, however, this time I wasn't.   


We shared a 10 year old son together, this was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, was to tell our son that his mother was gone forever. Addiction tears individuals apart and tears families apart, it is something that is very serious.   


I am actually a Film Maker, so after her death I decided to partner with a musician who wrote a song about addiction and create a powerful music video to help raise awareness for addiction. I would like to share that video with you here now and ask that if this video has an impact on you, rather big or small that you share it and hopefully it helps you or someone you know get help.

This question would be better in r/drugs or stims or benzos. But I'm on this sub every day, so I feel more comfortable asking here.

I took a tiny amount of coke tonight (rubbed a little on my gum & took a bump), not sure exactly what time I stopped but I know it was by 11pm (mtn time, not that that matters). For the first time since I started taking stims & benzos like 5 years ago, I forgot I'd just taken stims & took 1/4 of a 1 mg xanax around 12:45 am. Took another 1/4 about 30 seconds before I remembered I took stims that night.

I started purging right away & it looks like I got that second 1/4 out. But I'm not positive, & since I haven't ever made this mistake before I'm a little scared & not sure what to do. For reference I take about 2 mg xanax nightly (I know it's a bad idea to take these every day ftr. I'm slowly working on tapering). I'm 26 & dont think I have any serious heart conditions.

How much danger am I in guys? It wasn't a ton of either drug, so I can't tell whether I should keep purging until my stomach's empty or just ride this out or what..I know this is either a ridiculously dumb post or I made a very stupid mistake, but it is what it is.

Some of the things they tell you to do is to not use any synthetic opiates. I thought this was weird because they do not mention Natural Opiates.

Less toxic than say.. Hydrocodone?

Many opiates are naturally occuring in Opium, but they're all ""bound together"" in one plant. so its still in its natural state when consumed.

Ok so IF I understand all this correctly which is a big if, normal opiate agonists bind to the mu receptor agonize it and then detach and float around in your body and then reattach to another one with varying affinity(strength of attachment).

&#x200B;

<Please note I'm using terms sloppily and paraphrasing, feel free to correct me this is interesting!>

&#x200B;

These two drugs above however will attach to your mu receptors PERMANENTLY, they are never detaching. Sounds awesome right? Well not really since apparently mu receptors can only take so much agonizing until they internalize(get sucked back in and go into hibernation) taking them out of commission.

&#x200B;

So if what I am reading is correct these drugs should provide a powerful high for around 48 hours(narcan wouldn't work BTW!) at which point the mu receptors they are bound to would internalize, possibly leaving you with a near naive low tolerance? Maybe? I'm not sure if human beings, or addicts have ever consumed these, or if its all tests on guinea pig intestinal cells.

All that simply to say I ran a scam- is it still a scam if the spender got what they wanted?- so I went for a 1&1 from the most dependable vendor, which was 40 quid as the bloke only does twenties, and his twenties are well worth that money. The first stone I ever got from him was so fuckin fat that ever since I've been trying to acclimatise myself to the generally normal size of the white round my ways, convinced absolutely every time that the runner's pinched some of the rock or that the dude's simply getting stingy.

A sprinkle of vitamin C powder which had an accident a few weeks ago, leaving it clumpy, dotted throughout with shrapnel like Big Boss after the coma, and somewhere during or between those steps I squirted two randomly-filled-rigs-worth of tap water into the mix, because without water, nothing can occur. That's true for everything in existence. Well, nearly. ¬†
So yeah, strictly speaking I did have another snowball. With so little girl- and thus far I've purposely avoided using these specific American slang words for the drugs simply because I didn't really like them- and a rather large amount of boy, I wondered how much of this snowball I would actually feel.

Shit you‚Äôve had to do to get money/drugs, police encounters, being ripped off, dealing with asshole dealers..whatever. I‚Äôve come to realize other addicts almost always have at least a few good stories haha. 

I‚Äôll start it off with 2-

Me and a friend were both broke so we found some wire to scrap. Took it to the scrapyard and ended up being like $13 short for what we needed so decided to go to Walmart and steal a few of those big heavy gauge extension cords. We get to Walmart, grab a cart and go to the aisle. We weren‚Äôt sure exactly how many we needed and didn‚Äôt want to end up coming up short again so we figure better to be safe than sorry.  So we choose the longest heavy duty extension cords they had, they were like 100ft and costed $50/$60 each. 
We grab 8 of them, throw them in the cart and come to the conclusion that rather than just push the cart straight out like we already paid, it‚Äôd be less sketchy if we put our coats on top of them, he gets in the cart, and I push him out of the store. Well let‚Äôs just say our coats didn‚Äôt hide them at all and looking back at the situation, that was probably the MOST sketchy way possible haha. 
So anyway, we start heading towards the exit, no greeter/receipt checker so we think we‚Äôre good. We get through the first set of doors, about to walk through the second set when I‚Äôm pretty sure I hear ‚ÄúWalmart loss prevention‚Äù behind me in the quietest voice. I turn around and see this guy who I recognize from the aisle we got the cords from. He was there twice talking on his cell phone but not really looking at anything specific. Once I see him I already know I heard correctly and just keep walking. He says ‚ÄúExcuse me, Walmart loss prevention, please stop‚Äù and I of course ignore him. I had parked by the auto section where they do oil changes, so when we got outside I turned and start going down the sidewalk right in front of the store. Loss prevention is still following us but he‚Äôs staying back a bit for some reason.. I say ‚Äúyou ready?‚Äù to my friend (who‚Äôs still in the cart), he just gives me a look which I assumed meant he WAS in fact ready, so I stop short, putting the front of the cart against the garden section fence so it didn‚Äôt move as much when he jumped out and I start running, thinking he‚Äôs right behind me. Well he wasn‚Äôt, I get to the car and hear ‚Äúwait, wait, don‚Äôt leave‚Äù and see him still halfway between me and the cart. I start the car, open his door, and put the car in drive ready to takeoff once he gets in. We get away safely, no extension cords but at least we didn‚Äôt get arrested. LP stopped following us once we left the cart, I assume their main concern was getting their product back. We figured out another way to get money and after we copped and got high I asked him why it took so long to get to the car.. he says ‚ÄúI had to get our coats‚Äù Lmao like bruh, we have loss prevention following us and your first thought after hopping out the cart was to get our coats? Too funny.

This one is quick, just though it was kinda funny-
One time I met my dealer in a Home Depot parking lot. I was sick af and sat there for over an hour waiting. He finally shows up, I get my shit, and go into Home Depot straight to the bathroom. There‚Äôs 3 stalls, 2 of which also had someone in them so I decide to wait to get my shot ready. I‚Äôm sitting there impatiently for a few minutes when I hear an unmistakable sound, the flicking/opening of stamp bags. I say ‚Äúit sounds like we all had the same idea‚Äù and hear the other 2 people start laughing. I know they‚Äôre doing the same thing so I get my shot ready, do it and get out if there.

EDIT: I've added a TL;DR at the end of the post.

I've been clean of heroin and cocaine for approx two years. I was on methadone initially but really despise the stuff so changed to buprenorthine (we call it subutex of subbies) sometime in 2016..

So i was really keen to detox off the subbies before i start university in (oh my bloody fucking helllll) 5 bloody days. 5 days!! I'm kinda realising as i tyope how bloody soon that is! So i detoxed mid August and have been truly clean for 30 days (I say 'truly' clean as I'm aware that some people consider being on subutex or methadone as not true abstinence; interesting idea to debate as I'm on Quetiapine and Mirtazipine \[sp?\] probably forever. I'd be curious to know who would consider that to negate my abstinence).

Okay, so Iwent to a festival with a mate who likes to drink. I was undecided about about whether or not I'd drink - I was never an alcoholic really, but sadly, I can't be a casual drinker - I can't stop after a few and usually I just end up making a tit of myself. Or worse, I'll start fiending and will do absolutely anything to score (heroin, crack, ketamine or diazepam). My friend was drinking whisky, which is my choice of drink and probably the 'safest' drink for me - as I have in the past been able to have a hot toddy at a family xmas do, or a glass of Glenmorangie with ice and then just call it a day.

I realised that I'm really waffling. To cut a long story short, I scored crack and smack. This was Wednesday afternoon. I had a few pipes and sniffed a little of the gear. Thne I thought, if im going to do this, I'm going to do this properly (I don;t want any excuse tomorrow to score again). Took a taxi to a local pharmacy and bought some pins - online it said that there's a needle exchange in the pharmacy, turns out no, but I was able to buy a couple of pins (20p a pop! Who'da thought it?!)

So I've sorted myself a speedball and I'd really appreciate it if someone would run through some basic harm reduction with me.

To be really clear, i've not used heroin or crack cocaine (or anything) since April 2016. I'm not sober currently, I've smoked a little gear and a few pipes but obviously my tolerance is super low. I have a bunch of buprenorphine left over, is it at all possible that to use that in case of an overdose? I've heard it has naltrexone in it?Of course that would be a total last resort and probably sounds really stupid, but I'd rather deal with instant withdrawal than to OD..

EDIT: Is it possible to purchase naltrexone from a chemist? Headshop?

EDIT: TL;DR:  
I've relapsed but don't want to die tonight. Seeking any harm reduction knowledge or info regarding naloxone in the UK.

EDIT: I've heard of a few overdoses occurring in the UK due to another more potent opiate being in the gear. I can't remember the name of the stuff but there was a Louis Theroux documentary about it in the US somewhere. There's also been a few mentions of it on BBC Radio 4 and I've seen several posters warning of the increased likelihood of overdosing if your skag is laced with this stuff. I'm based in North West England, should I be concerned about this stuff? Also, as I've been clean 2+ years so I don't have a regular guy who I can trust not to give me dodgy gear...",1536801073.0

That out of the way, My connect is a woman that gets fat scripts every month. For years the process goes as follows -

\-1: She gets her script

\-2: I middle for her on a single big deal that moves 2/3 of her product and nets her about $500 and nets me about $300 which I use to pay the power bill.

\-3: As the weeks progress, I get the odd front here and there and I end up owing her about 60-90 bucks when the scripts  run out.

\-4: The following month, she re-ups, we do the single 2/3 deal as per usual and I pay her what I owe her out of my $300.

&#x200B;

This has been the routine since time out of mind. Well this time, she sold her main nut to someone else (historically I've been her only buyer because I'm safe, simple and have only a couple of clients I sell to) and then lied about it saying that the pharmacy was out and had to order the script leaving me calling her \*every\* day asking about whether it's come in yet. Also, me telling MY clients that I'm waiting on the pharmacy when in fact, she had it the whole goddamn time.

Instead of making this a ludicrously long post the TL;DR is:

It's in a packet but I'm still paranoid: could anyone have done anything to it say, how you could sabotage a condom in the wrapper and nobody would notice?  
I've been sticking to my Subutex for a week but have the ingredients for a speedball right now and no other rigs.  
Have some old Vit C powder, but could I use Epsom salts to cook the crack and the #3 down? Or shall I stick to my Vit C?

9faa7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9faa7d/methadone_potentiation_success/,3,https://redd.it/9faa7d,Connokofang,Methadone Potentiation: Success!,"So I have been trying to find a proper methadone potentiator for a long time. Obviously certain drugs like benzos or other sedatives that are scheduled narcotics work. However I have been looking for something more accessible and not illegal or requiring a dealer or prescription. I know I could use alcohol but this just makes the methadone feel dirty. 

So far I have tried a variety of otc drugs and supplements with varying results. 
Baking soda an hour before felt like it increased the amount of methadone that was metabolized though not that great. Cats claw seemed to do the same thing at about the same level. Prilosec did this to but was actually noticeably quite effective and I was left with pinned pupils and slight euohoria that I do not usually get from my daily usual dose. Still this experience was lacking for some reason and did not feel adequate enough however. I tried white grapefruit juice and this did seem to heighten the effects slightly as well. Also tried chamomile and this literally knocked me out on the floor and according to my house mates it looked as if I had a minor seizure so never again ( I was coming off benzos around this time though I was doing a careful tamper but this might explain what happened). As for things like soma, tagamet and promethazine I cannot get these in Canada or require a prescription unfortunately. 
This is where I almost gave up. 
I kept reading and a medication  called ophenadrine kept coming up as a drug that is a muscle relaxer and antihistamine that can cause euphoria and according to anecdotal results and studies people reported that when taken with an opiate it increased analgesic effects and ""helped the opiate find the pain better"". 

This is where I got interested and went to a pharmacy I dont usually go to and they had some for a relatively cheap price. I took 200mg and then went to dose my methadone at my clinic ( 75mg). For the 30 minutes that I walked before I got to my clinic I noticeably could tell the spasms I usually get in my calf had subsided and so had my sciatica pain that had been bothering me for days. Oddly I also felt in a much better mood then usual and felt that slight euphoria that people reported about it. 

One hour after dosing my methadone I could feel it coming on alot stronger then usual and noticeably a dull headache I usually get had subsided and methadone alone usually doesn't help this. I had a bong bowl and from here things got really interesting. Heavy sedation and a heavy nod that marijuana does not cause usually happened as I dont feel an interaction between cannabis and methadone ever. The classic opiated feel and almost weightlessness kicked in with feelings of relief and relaxation and clarity that I only seem to feel when I take short acting opiates. 

I Would not recommend potentiating methadone as this is dangerous and obviously the point of maintenance is maintenance and not to get high mixing things that mess with your CNS and can cause heavy respiratory depression ending in death. The reason that I do this is that I have major chronic pain issues and I feel that methadone can actually cover this if I find ways to make it work better and based on doctors and patients notes about orphenadrine increasing analgesia and helping the painkillers I had to try and these people were not kidding. I imagine for increased effects I could do something like take prilosec and ophenadrine but I dont want to add too many things together and obviously create interactions that are dangerous and that cause too much pronounced respiratory depression.",1536776610.0

There's nothing visual about them, it's all sensory. Like if you were to close your eyes in your own living room, your senses would tell you where you are due to how familiar the surroundings are.

When I have these dreams, my mind is convinced im going to be in a certain place when i come out if it, but of course since i havent moved an inch, I'm exactly where I nodded off.

That explanation seems a bit complicated so here's an example:

I just did my business on the steps in my back yard. I had one of those nods where you didn't realize it happened until you come back around.

Well my mind was convinced I was going to open my eyes and be in the driver seat of my car with the door open, parked in my driveway. This is obviously not the case, as I have not moved from the stairs.

Freaks me out sometimes because occasionally my nod-consciousness makes me think i nodded out at a very inappropriate location.",1536731500.0

You will only be thinking about it every once and a while. If you relax yourself, and take a few deep breathes, chill out, really mellow, in a zen-state, you simply are able to feel it more, rather than if you're running around the house or playing soccer. 

Though i admit if you have nothing on your mind and you are moving around and being social with nobody snapping at you , with friends, this also can work, but the point is you really gotta calm down . or i do. i noticed the times that opiates have not effected me in the last 10 years are times in which i was being extremely active. for instance, tonight i was rubbing my mothers feet and helping her after her surgery, so i didn't have time to think about it, and i took more buprenorphine than i needed (a little less than 2mg)
I probably only needed 1mg, as yesterday, 0.50mg, had worked quite well, but did not alleviate my pain (as stated in previous post)


I've been using Bupe for 10 years. Im just trying to figure out how to make it work better cuz ive been in very severe chronic pain.


And im not syaing this goes for everyone, but when im relaxed, i really do feel the bupe more, in a euphoric sense, the sense of good well being . i know its not easy for people to achieve this state but idk

thats how i feel

chillin = awesome


being uppidy and doing shit = you aint thinking about it till you realized you mighta taken a bit too much that you maybe didnt even need.

so if you get what im saying, you can make more out of less


i break my 2mg'ers into 4 to 8 pieces, and take small amounts. also, if it goes past A particular time in which i feel like it won't be effective bcause i will be thinking too much or being too active i will hold off. holding off is OK ! 



anyways just posting my thoughts , i realize that they may seem like common sense or bullshit to some people, but this may help some people lower their doseage naturally. without even doing anything..........

go zen mode or go home.

We would seize it.,"Just because all that information came to light doesn‚Äôt mean that it all came to a head. It would be another year or more before these revelations would have serious effect on our lives. Things went like they always did. We woke up. We hit licks. We nodded out. We talked and slept for the night. The most common was to boost from the stores and sell the merchandise to fences, a fence being someone who buys stolen goods at a discount to resell them later. There were lines of them downtown. Mostly Mexicans who resold the stuff we brought them at a flea market on the weekends. Sometimes we sold to an older Asian man who lurked the area.

They paid five bucks for two twelve-dollar cans of Crew pomade.   Pomade was easy to steal. They paid five bucks for two big cans of instant coffee. A tube of good toothpaste might fetch a dollar, and other smaller items like lip stick or shampoo might get us another buck, so we stole lots. Rufus had a large gym bag he‚Äôd bring. I had a bookbag and carried two fabric shopping bags, the reusable kind you get at the front of the store for a couple bucks.

Every morning, we‚Äôd do whatever we had left over from the night before, a rinse or some morphine to split and maybe some benzos to take which fueled the kleptomania, which starts with a K and an L like kleptomania. I wondered if that was a coincidence or not, because when I took it, stealing from the stores seemed as inconsequential as dying in a video game. Kleptomania. Klonopin. I don‚Äôt know. Someone told me that kleptomania was a legitimate side effect of benzos. It was definitely true that they caused people to steal, but I‚Äôd heard that people could get off shoplifting charges if they were prescribed. Sounded cool but also like a lie.

Stealing our subway rides was always a challenge. But it was also like a game. Some transit official might see us coming and batten down the hatches to prevent us from coming, but while they did that, we would go back up to the street level and come in from across the street, jumping over the turnstile or sliding under it. Sometimes, we took the handicapped elevator. There was always a way.

Whenever we got to the strip mall with the stores we were hitting for the day, we‚Äôd hide one set of bags somewhere. Inside, Rufus or I would cause a distraction. The other would run through the choice aisles and fill his bags with the goods. Sometimes, we split up to save time and hit stores in a more modest fashion to avoid trouble. Once, I came back to a Safeway to find Rufus being reprimanded by a cop as management suspected him of stealing but when they called the cops, they couldn‚Äôt prove it. He laughed when they let him go and watched the cop drive off. Rufus had already been out of the store and stashed the loot in a port-a-potty. At a Walgreen‚Äôs once, a young Asian boy who obviously worked at the store was sent to follow me around awkwardly reading through a packet of coupons. I confronted him, but he just stood behind me fake reading through the deals Walgreen‚Äôs was offering that week. He made it harder to lift all that I wanted. I only got out with a few cans of Crew that night.

When we got back to the city, we sold our stuff downtown and walked up Pill Hill to get our Dilaudid or morphine. Sometimes, we called Victor and rode the bus to meet him on the other side of town. Sometimes, we went to eat at a soup kitchen where they were giving out free meals, but I always struggled to eat next to the flailing and mentally insane masses in the cafeterias. I always felt like there was feces floating in the air or being flung into my food by the people eating next to me. One night, this kid was walking around the spot where we slept and approached us. He looked like was maybe 19 or 20.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù He said.

Rufus and I looked at each other. The kid was way too well dressed to be talking to us. I mean, he was wearing what looked like an expensive pair of tasseled penny loafers with no socks. A sharp pastel pink collar stuck out of a clean Izod sweater. Rufus and I were sitting on a bench pooling tobacco from half smoked cigarettes, so we could reroll it.

‚ÄúDo you guys know where to get any heroin?‚Äù He spoke with a British accent.

Rufus and I looked at each other again, suspiciously this time. A pair of bicycle cops rode by. One made eye contact with me. Was this young procurer one of them? Could he be trusted. Rufus spoke up first.

‚ÄúHey, youngster. Why don‚Äôt you make the block real quick. Let me and my associate here have a little talk. Come right back. See what we can work out.‚Äù

He walked away. Rufus turned to me.

‚ÄúWhat do ya think?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got an accent. Probably legit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. What do we have left?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know maybe a twenty piece. He looks rich.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure does.‚Äù

When the kid came back we told him we‚Äôd be happy to part with what we had but wanted 50 for it. It was a scandalous thing to do. 50 was too much. But this wasn‚Äôt the time to start pretending that we had morals. Opportunity revealed itself. We would seize it. Everything else was an afterthought and really didn‚Äôt matter.

‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWe only have to go to my parent‚Äôs flat.‚Äù

‚ÄúFlat?‚Äù Rufus asked.

‚ÄúHe means apartment.‚Äù I spoke up and turned towards the kid asking. ‚ÄúSay. What‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúEdmund.‚Äù

‚ÄúK. Edmund. Let‚Äôs get to your flat, sir.‚Äù Rufus said in a fake British accent.

We walked for what seemed like an hour, and by the time we got there, Rufus and I were sweaty. The regular stale stench of our clothes used the humidity and heat from our bodies to push an even more pungent aroma of body odor and street into the halls of the apartment building. In the elevator, Edmund turned to us and said,

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just say you‚Äôre my chums from secondary or university.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked horrified.

‚ÄúSounds sweet to me.‚Äù Rufus said.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for us to be telling your parents we‚Äôre your friends from secondary or university. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, Edmund, Rufus and I are street people. I don‚Äôt think your parents would buy it. Can‚Äôt you just go in and come back out real quick with the money?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could, but it will work better if we tell them a story.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of story?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be more likely if they see you. We‚Äôll say you are my mates from school. I‚Äôll say you need money for a cab ride home.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me. My parents are easy.‚Äù

I shook my head again and looked at Rufus. He smiled. His expression seemed indifferent about the idea of going into this kid‚Äôs parent‚Äôs apartment and telling them an obvious lie so he could get money for us. We walked on nice carpet and by nice tables with vases of flowers on them and looked into the clean mirrors hanging on the wall that Rufus and I never saw in the buildings we visited. There were plugin air fresheners pushing out the warm scents of cinnamon and pumpkin into the hallway. He and I were used to the smell of stale urine and mildew and meth smoke escaping through the cracks under the doors. The hallways of the welfare hotels we knew so well had holes in the walls and unintelligible words scrawled or scratched into the plaster, and the carpet was always ragged and stained. We were very clearly somewhere we didn‚Äôt belong.

Edmund opened the door and greeted his mother from there with a shout. His father walked into our field of view from the hallway. He held his head sideways and wore glasses peering over his son‚Äôs shoulder to see Rufus and me standing behind him. Edmund turned to us.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

‚ÄúEdmund,‚Äù his father spoke, ‚ÄúWho do you have with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome chums from university, Father.‚Äù He said it *fah-tha.* It was something like a caricature of a spoiled English boy. Then again, it wasn‚Äôt really a caricature. He was a spoiled English boy.

‚ÄúTell them to sit down. We‚Äôre about to have dinner.‚Äù A woman‚Äôs voice called from the kitchen, his mother.

We sat down. The parents eyed us. They looked doubtful that we could be his classmates from college. There was a pot of soup and a pan of fried fish next to some plates of vegetables and potatoes. A bottle of wine. Sitting there, it occurred to me that we didn‚Äôt know what college this kid went to in the first place. If they asked any questions about that, we were screwed. We‚Äôd be outed, if they didn‚Äôt recognize that we were impostors already. They should have. It was obvious, but Rufus began to do his thing.

They were enamored. He was calling them by their names, which were Lucy and Harry Brown, like he was their old friend. Another bottle of wine came out. Lucy shouted and laughed at Rufus‚Äôs jokes. Harry made his own. Rufus spoke in his fake British accent and had started calling Harry by Harold. At one point, Rufus stood up and took Lucy by the hand for a small waltz around the table. Edmund and I traded looks. Harold clapped and cheered them on, his face red with laughter. They popped another cork on another bottle.

Eventually, the joking and laughing and shouting moved to softer more intimate talking. Lucy swayed from the wine. Harry‚Äôs smile bubbled up from inside of himself so that he couldn‚Äôt stop. He looked to be speechless. Rufus talked about his crazy life, and Lucy asked him how he met Boom Boom. She nodded to me with her head when she asked.

‚ÄúBoom Boom? He is my dearest and sweetest friend in this whole miserable life, Lucy. He is.‚Äù She swooned. ‚ÄúI was a scoundrel, Lucy. I was a scoundrel and he was good to me.‚Äù Rufus made eye contact with me and held it as he said it. I recalled the night I found him talking on the shoe like a phone.

‚ÄúTell me. Where does one get a name like Boom Boom?‚Äù She asked.

I stared. Rufus took the opportunity to answer.

‚ÄúYou want to know? Sit back, sweet Lucy. I‚Äôll tell you the tale. Harold, I see you‚Äôre with us still. Please, listen. Don‚Äôt let the wine take you from us yet. This is one I call the Strange Case of the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It‚Äôs quite the tale, and our beloved Boom Boom is the star.‚Äù He spoke in somber tones and held his hand out towards me, palm up, like an announcer introducing the main attraction in a circus freak show.

Rufus could really tell a story. I like to think that I take my inspiration from him. There‚Äôs no way though. He was such a natural, and that night, we were all blessed to sit at that dinner table and listen to what a master at his craft. He cleared his throat.

‚ÄúI am now and was then a scoundrel. As I‚Äôve told you, Boom Boom was very good to me. He treated me with kindness and compassion most never do. We spent every second together after that. These are things you already know, but he went by a different name at the time. One we won‚Äôt discuss, as it was one I never liked. No. No. I knew right away that I would have to change his name to one he deserved. The opportunity only had to show itself. And it did a week after we met.

‚ÄúThere was a strange man who showed up one day at our park out of nowhere. The man had obviously been in prison for most of his adult life. He wore a denim button up long sleeve shirt tucked into his jeans. His face was all tattooed up and he walked around showing the back of his palms and his thumbs sticking in. It was the prison walk and posture. You know what I‚Äôm talking about, right, Lucy?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt. Harry was drooling on the table. ‚ÄúWell, he had gotten a reputation around the block for grabbing at one of the girls we knew back then. Her name was Buffy. The guy also robbed several dealers at the park. These were guys we knew, so pretty quickly, he got the nickname the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It was a strange case, as I‚Äôve said.

‚ÄúEnter, Boom Boom. Me and Boom Boom went to the park to sell a bag to a customer. When we got there, the Hammer was already up our buyer‚Äôs butt. The transaction was made. We walked away but heard our customer screaming for help before we got to the street. The Hammer was roughing the guy up on the basketball court, and out of nowhere, Boom Boom was on him. I‚Äôd tell you, Lucy, about how long the fight lasted, but I can‚Äôt rightly call it a fight. It was a knocking out. Boom Boom caught him with one left hook, and just like that, the man who had terrorized the local homeless and addicted population of the area for those few weeks was down for the count. Before we ran, I saw some kind of bloody ooze leaking from the man‚Äôs head onto the pavement. Later, I found out from Buffy, our female acquaintance who saw the whole thing, that the man was taken away in an ambulance, but not before the police handcuffed him to the gurney. He‚Äôd violated his parole and went back. We never saw him again. But that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the story of how Boom Boom became Boom Boom! The first Boom is the sound of his fist against the face. The next Boom is the sound of his opponent's head hitting the ground.‚Äù

Rufus looked up and smiled at me with a gleam in his eye. I smiled back. Lucy clapped her hands and laughed.

‚ÄúWOW! What a story, Rufus!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNow, what are the plans for you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur plans?‚Äù Rufus asked.

‚ÄúYes. What does the future hold for the two of you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve had dreams of starting my own construction business. Not sure what to call it yet, but our motto will be‚Ä¶.‚Äù Rufus held his hands out and up in front of him as if framing a distant billboard with them, ‚ÄúOur motto will be, That Should Be Good Enough.‚Äù

Lucy clapped again and laughed. ‚ÄúHahaha! That‚Äôs perfect. I love it, Rufus. Gentlemen, it‚Äôs been an amazing night. I have to get Harold here to sleep.‚Äù

Rufus and I opened our eyes wide and lift our eyebrows at the kid. Edmund needed to get that money from them before they slept. This was his chance.

‚ÄúEh.. Mother?‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúYes, Edmond?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe chaps are in need of fare for a taxi home. I promised them we would help.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Of course! Of course! Let me see what I have.‚Äù She found a one-hundred-dollar bill in her purse and held it up for us to see. ‚ÄúAll I have is a hundred. Will this work?‚Äù

It would work. We thanked her and said our good byes. She carried her husband to the back bedroom, and Rufus and I walked out the front door with the kid. It was obvious that he would want change or something more for the money.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Edmund said.

‚ÄúWell, we can take you with us to the store for change or you can walk with us to get something more. It‚Äôs late and street dealers don‚Äôt work in the city at night. It‚Äôll be an adventure. Are you down?‚Äù Rufus said.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù The kid affirmed. We got in the elevator and hit the button for ground. It might be daylight before we could find anything. We‚Äôd let him realize that when it was already too late and he was too invested to back out. No need to spoil the fun before it started.",1536725250.0

What i came away with is that the feelings that Buprenorphine give you override the feeling of pain rather than actually killing it

130mg of DHC was less than 0.50mg of Buprenorphine

Upsides:
12 hour DHC definitely covers you for over 20 hours, you won't feel any withdrawal until the next day, or a few days later.
-----------------------------------------
Buprenorphine gets me high as fuck.



Downsides:
Instant Release DHC will have you wanting more medicine by night-time if taken in the morning


-------------
Buprenorphine doesn't really kill internal pain that well, or my pain is greater than the bupe.

Overall

130mg of dihydrocodeine was found to be a little b it less substantial than 0.50mg of buprenorphine but had a greater painkilling effect than buprenorphine.


The first day i had started with a geater doseage of DHC, 120mg ER and around 30mg IR .

DHC honestly doesnt have as much feeling to it as codeine. but it wasn't unpleasant


Im unsure whether to continue will 0.25 to 0.50mg buprenorphine or continue with 130mg dihydrocodeine.

and like i said, i found the 0.50mg bupe to be far stronger in terms of the actual euphoric effects but nnot in physical effects to actually kill pain. which it should be.

dihydrocodeine alleviated it during one of the worst possible moments


i was also able to use both low dose DHC and Buprenorphine in the same day.

i had learned that you CAN use Bupe and a short-acting opioid in the same day after being indoctrinated in several clinics by high-ranking doctors. so this is not my first time doing this but i also do not recommend it , theres a chance i have bupe built up in my body even if its a small amount to void pwd .but also on doctors note stating that i could take buprenorphine in the same day as taking codeine/dhc/hydrocodone/oxy (NOT oxycontin or longtec or ER)

So anything that is 6-8 hrs and <40mg of hydrocone or so, you should not incur any PWD when inducting into Buprenorphine . 

my assumption is that buprenorphine is so strong that it actually pushes the DHC/Hydrocodone/(short acting opioids) off of the receptors rather than actually fighting them for it and incurring the precipitated withdrawal.



This is basically a shitpost because ill be following up with my doctors . But advice is still appreciative:

1) im not trying to quit opioids, i have no need to quit opioids.
2) i am not looking for opioids, but suggestions on how to kill pain. (no kratom, no NSAIDs {unless its something i have not heard of}, muscle relaxers {pretty much allergic}, no tramadol {makes me loopy}
3) have any of you ever had trigger point injections work for your pain, and actually stay & work? (effect stayed over time?)
i guess lidocaine or botox would be used


Final Thoughts: DHC ER is great if you wanted to quit a long-term Buprenorphine useage while reducing your doseage further than you could reduce it with buprenorphine. It doesnt really get you high. IN the UK / EU they also use it to detox people. It lasts 6 hours instead of 3, and in ER form it lasts 12. ",1536711203.0

I have abused basically every drug. I have been escaping with drugs for so long now. I have been hospitalized for multiple overdoses, including a meth freakout. After taking a massive dose of untested ecstasy I feel so anxious 24/7 my chest feels like it's going to explode. I tried a little Xanax binge to see if the anxiety would go away, but I'm just as anxious in my chest. This is the SECOND time I did a crazy drug and feel like I'm gonna have. a heart attack. six years ago I took a massive dose of DXM and freaked the fuck out and wasn't the same for 5 years. That is what started my oxycodone addiction. now I made the SAME mistake with ecstasy, I deserve death. I am truly a failure but I'm scared to end my own life. Even if I can get sober, my body has endured too much damage. Even if it's anxiety and not organ damage, there has simply been too much stress to my body for an entire life time. IT'S OVER. I lost. I will not reproduce, as I've fucked my body so much I wouldn't risk putting a child in this world if I'm gonna drop dead by age 40 due to taking INSANE doses of stimulants, Benzos, opiates, psychedelics, etc EVERYTHING. 

If I'm not going to reproduce do to fucking my body up permanently with drugs, then I'd have to find some type of purpose in life, otherwise it's pointless.

I had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. 

 Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me ""where is all your money going"", but she coughed up the cash.

Now here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?

I played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  ""the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive"". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say ""damn girl, you're a speed addict"".

I told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.

Now I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!

Whenever people post pics of Heroin that they‚Äôve just scored, if it‚Äôs not in a clip seal bag, it seems like it‚Äôs packaged (does one ‚Äúserve‚Äù Heroin?) in what looks like small bits of folded paper about the size of stamps? 

I see people refer to these when in a larger quantity and held together with an elastic band as ‚Äúbundles??‚Äù. I may be wrong on that as well though. 

So, if I may beg your indulgence, what are those things (is it literally paper folded in half?) and if so, how does the powder not simply slide out of it?

[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/)

In the study - the regent of liquid codeine solution was microwaved with a 450w microwave at 20C for 5 minutes with activated charcol as a regent. Apprantly the microwave radiation hydrodinizes the codeine into dihydrocodeine with stunning yields, which can be further converted to HYDROCODONE

Would this experiment work in low yields at home conditions? I haven't studied chemistry to any  huge degree, was just a part of my biology bachelors, so i'm not really knowledgable about the terms and conditions used in this experiment.

&#x200B;

Regardless - i have a 450w microwave, and i'm gonna try microwaving the liquid solution for 6 minutes at 20C to see the results (since i have bigger ammounts of codeine solution)

EDIT: probably not gonna work, ""2.5‚Äâg codeine was suspended in water (30‚ÄâmL) and acetic acid was added until codeine dissolved (1‚ÄâmL). pH of codeine solution was recorded at 4.75. 0.20‚Äâg Pt on activated charcoal catalyst (1% Pt/C) was added to solution. This solution was put into a CEM discover microwave reactor (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC). The upper part of the reactor was filled with inert nitrogen gas by passing nitrogen gas and the addition of H2 to the system is started. The initial hydrogen pressure was set as 5‚Äâpsi in all experiments. H2gas was deflated giving the reactor nitrogen gas.""

I don't really have Nitrogen gas reserves at home, and no microwave that can set pressure levels for hydrogen absorbtion. Thought it has something to do with Hydrogen from Water connecting to codeine... eh, well, gonna try for anecdotal science",1536670476.0

9ewuza,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuza/im_in_icu/,16,https://redd.it/9ewuza,dori_88,I'm in ICU,"Early Monday morning around 2am I got up to go get a glass of water downstairs, because i had a night terror and was really in pain. Even I  was convinced it was just anxiety. 

When reaching for a glass to pour the water i tuned my head and stretched a bit to get the glass. Never got it because when made that  movement my whole neck cracked followed by a loud pop.

So, outside I went to get air.  I found myself sitting on the backyard patio dizzy with severe shooting pains and classic problems like tingling and full blown nausea.  Pain sky rocketed from 2 to 8 in 30 minutes the dizziness was so bad i called 911. I simply couldn't stand up. I was too afraid of falling than anything else. 

So paramedics came in the back gate and transported me to the hospital because that 8 jumped to yikes the second they did that bp was also 145/108 with 110 pain rate.  

The ER doctor was an asshole and wouldn't give me anything addictive including benadryl iv and insisted on a 2nd CT Scan that showed no changes according to him and that I just had a pinched nerve.  I countered with, ""well, why does my neurosurgeon say the screws are loose upon his evacuation of the CT?"" The ER doctor was arrogant and said he must've looked at it wrong because he might've been rushing.  

So he was more than happy to call my neurosurgeon at 6am to evaluate it carefully to calm my nerves but went off shift at 7am. 

Well he calls the neurosurgeon at 6am by this time its been 5hrs and I've recieved oral flexril and an IM benadryl shot. 

Without an IV at 6am the neurosurgeon said i needed an admission so neurosurgeon could be down there and see me/evaluate my 2 CTs and MRI. The ER doc was reluctant to admit me and told me I'd likely go home after the neurosurgeon determined it wasn't serious. 

I almost believed him and almost took him up on the offer to discharge me at that very moment where u could follow up outpatient. I didn't though because by the grace of my higher power my neurosurgeon was going to already be doing  surgeries at the hospital I was at.  So I stuck around to get the MRI read and and calm my anxiety so that i could go home with peace of mind and throw out my flexeril. 

I spent 8hours in tears, but remained calm convinced it was all an 8hr long panic attack. The ER doc went off shift. A new ER doctor came in and just reinforced the original ER doctor's sentiments.

Finally, 10 hours later the neurosurgeon arrives and cofims that I indeed DO HAVE LOOSE SCREWS and ontop of that the whole plate is shifted causing c5 where a spacer is starting to herinate and is punching my spinal column likely causing my severe pain.  He put me on his Operating Schedule for the day ordered me a 1mg dilaudid shot and then 3hours later I underwent major surgery.  

I am currently hospitalized in the ICU following surgery and have been pushing the narcotics off as much as possible. Dilaudid is ordered every 4hrs. I've had opportunities for 4 doses. Due to the medical necessity I am still  43 sober as of today.  

I've been reaching out taking each problem at a time as well as not future tripping. Im also proud for staying calm in the ER and leaving it to my higher power.",1536666878.0
9ewuod,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuod/like_a_freight_train_i_heard_in_the_distance_i/,23,https://redd.it/9ewuod,Adamdkc,"Like a freight train I heard in the distance, I never saw the the tracks I was standing on.","It's hard to pinpoint where this all started. I grew up between 2 houses, parents who divorced before I knew what marriage was. My dad was successful and lived down south in the islands with his former lover and new wife. He only got to see me every other holiday, and some random weekends he would pick me up from the private school he paid for and my mother taught at.

My mom was a paranoid schizophrenic who loved her son as much as she could, given her condition. I had anger issues growing up. Not the kind to predetermine a serial killer or anything, I was just a little confused about why my mother cried at night over the phone to my aunt about the rent and why my dad just bought a new boat. I  guess I didn't understand why two people raising a child together couldn't help one another financially. 

As I got older, i understood that my father paid child support and that Christmas at his house was a literal wonderland. I also began to understand that my father left my mother for the woman who lives in his house, and it ruined her.  

 Before the private school she taught at, my mom hopped around our state a lot, going to school and racking up debt. She was a genius in her own right, but she changed universities quite often pursuing different degrees. One year we found ourselves living in an RV in my aunt's yard. My aunt, who would be my mother's sister, had a son named Daryl. Daryl was a few years older than me, and aside from the common hazing boys give one another, he was always kind to me. I thought it was fantastic, as I could spend as much time with Daryl and his older friends as possible. I couldn't stop thinking about my cool older cousin introducing me to his neighborhood friends. 

The neighborhood happened to be a very rough part of the general Miami metro area called the Wick. As young as I was, I idolized Daryl and his friends. When Daryl got caught drinking schnapps  with our next door neighbor, I snuck a swig while he was being berated in the next room. I thought the shit was disgusting, but I told Daryl about it the second we were alone.

Daryl always did his best to keep me away from his life style and the shit his friends would get into. Later that year my mom and I moved away after she discovered some kind of medical needles under my aunt's bed, and Daryl was arrested for running around the neighborhood naked after drinking some tea he made with some flowers he knew where to find.

Over the years, we would visit on holidays and Daryl would share his weed with me. He was shocked when his 12 year old cousin asked to find him some bud, but he obliged. The stories passed around the family about Daryl got worse over the years, gang mischief, prison for drug trafficking. For some reason, I never felt negativity about the situations. I was always mildly intrigued.

Years go by, and sometime in there my mother takes the easy way out. She decided to stick a garden hose in the tail pipe of our family van, and shove the other end into her car window. Left with one parent I hardly knew and a rebellious attitude, I headed off to an island of rich white folk, where drugs weren't really sold as much as just there. I wasn't really welcome there, i had grown up in a larger area that had a heavy music scene, and I thought that was all the rage.  I met a few kids who got into it as well, and shortly after I had my group.

 In our early years of high school, acid and weed were all the rage for us.  We tripped every weekend, and we always wanted to push it harder than we had previously. If I were forced to pinpoint a time in my life that I should have been alarmed about my interest in drugs and escaping reality, it would be the time my friend Jeff's girlfriend gave me some of her mother's pain meds she didn't take from her cancer prognosis. 

""I can get you this stuff whenever dude. It's not really my thing and my mom is into the whole holistic medicine stuff. Just give me 20 bucks every time i give you a bottle and we'll be square.""

Every time I took the things they made me puke, but afterwards it was bliss. I realized I had to share this with my fellow students, and at age 15 I started moving MS Contin to kids at parties. I had never heard the word opiate before, or seen heroin outside of D.A.R.E., and the idea that these pills Alexa was supplying me with to sell were addictive is something I didnt understand until almost a decade later.

I eventually left that island and went on to my own life, joining the army at 19, discovering painkillers as I know them now around the same time via some army buddies, and some civilian buddies from a college town I lived in before the service. I served my time honorably, drinking whenever possible as infantryman do, and deploying as infantryman also do. I ended my service honorably, with a divorce under my belt and a few Purple Hearts, along with a 70% disability rating from the PTSD I was told I suffered from. I never took the meds, the depression ones made me cold and the insomnia ones made me dead. Instead I found cocaine, and popularity in the waterfront city I moved to after I got out.

Now, WHY am I prescribed painkillers and why have I been on them for the best part of a decade? (None of this provides personally identifying info and no it didn‚Äôt make the papers). 

I‚Äôve ridden motorcycles for years. Since I was 5. Sports bikes are (one of) my passions. 

I was involved in a high speed accident some years ago, when I say high speed I say in the vicinity of 190km/hr (not sure MPH, you can google it) on a public road not a track. We know this because I was wearing a GoPro. No I was not charged as it was an accident. 

I fell asleep. I woke up in a ditch. Everything hurt. I nearly died. My injuries were/are as follows for those interested:

‚Ä¢ Unstable C5/C6 cervical fractures. Stable T1/T2 unstable L4 fractures. 

‚Ä¢ Broken radius/ulna

‚Ä¢ Dislocated shoulder

‚Ä¢ 4 Broken ribs & fractured sternum

‚Ä¢ Broken scapula (doc was VERY impressed with that one).

‚Ä¢ Broken femur & clavicle. 

‚Ä¢Conncussion & mild TBI.

‚Ä¢ Variois soft tissue injuries.

Oh and a unilateral tension pneumothorax. 

Multiple surgeries blah blah. 

But that‚Äôs a snapshot of why I‚Äôm here, why I‚Äôm prescribed painkillers & all that shit. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and if you made it this far, you get a good star ‚≠êÔ∏è

P.s I‚Äôll post some ‚Äúpill porn‚Äù when I get home from my latest script.

I‚Äôve never been this low before or this hot with the law or living this every single penny counts life. I was living out of my car this time last winter but had money and no problems with the cops.

I am on 40+ mg of oxy a day and I have lost my doctor and all the other doctors here want me to use medical cannabis for my pain but it doesn‚Äôt work 100% and is very expensive and I have had a financial change and can‚Äôt afford to spend my rent money on cannabis. 

I am hoping I can get some prescriptions for a few months until I can get this under control but so far my only option is to basically go broke and withdraw from oxy and use cannabis aggressively and try and taper off the oxy. 

Now the problem and the reason for the post. I am getting almost suicidal trying to manage without oxy, yet when I take it everything is dandy and it‚Äôs helpful but costly to smoke bud and I can use less opioid, so maybe I can stretch things but I worry about the day I have no oxy and am sick and in pain and suicidal. I know we have methadone clinics nearby that I can self refer to, however I can‚Äôt use methadone and cannabis and don‚Äôt know what methadone is like. I don‚Äôt want to buy pills off dealers as I don‚Äôt actually want to die and I obviously am not ready for heroin if I don‚Äôt want pills and don‚Äôt like spending money on weed. 

Does anyone think methadone would help pain and put me in a mental place I can survive? Is it free? I found Kratom at a head shop but don‚Äôt trust it because it‚Äôs not regulated/tested and as I said am trying to find a way to live without endangering my life. ",1536640278.0

I mean sure occasionally I will find someone selling a few percs and once I was able to buy a very obviously pressed blue 30mg oxy. But overall hydromorphone is the most widely available and used opiate. Every other daily user I've met uses hydromorphone. Even when I was in a car accident at The age of 18 I was written a script for hydromorphone both in the ER and later by my doctor. It seems like it is the go to choice for almost every doctor when writing a prescription as every person I know with a regular opioid prescription is getting hydromorph contin. This really confuses me as it seems like one of the easiest and most rewarding opioids to abuse. I mean they are just these capsule full of extended release beads and they are so easy to crush, not to mention every pharmacy sells pill crushers that make easy work of breaking them down. 

  With the opioid epidemic being such a hot button issue right now it seems odd that doctors will right off the hop write a prescription for one of the most easy to abuse opioids with the largest jump between oral and IV Bioavalibility. Hell the fact that I can only really get hydromorph reliably is the only reason I started to shoot in the first place as I have no problem snorting heroin and popping oxy when I order them online as the smaller jump in potency just doesn't justify the risk for me in the same way hydromorph does. Not to mention the fucking amazing rush you get from shooting hydromorph where as when snorted or plugged it is honestly a pretty average opioid. 

   The last thing I wanted to mention was the price, on the street a 6mg cap will usually go for 20$ and they are always very easy to find at that price however if you get a good connect it isn't too hard to find a 4mg pill for 10$ or even a 6mg for that price. So looking at those prices you can easily see how snorting them really isn't very affordable as they are obviously priced based on the IV dosage.",1536639895.0

What are you guys talking about? As far as I am aware there are at least in the USA state RX databases, and in countries with free government healthcare yea there are permanent computer records. Doctors or hospitals keep records on you, but you have to agree to transfer these or even carry them yourself to the new physician.

But even the state RX databases often only go back so many years, its not lifetime.

&#x200B;

Pick up and leave the state, or wait out the database, go to new doctor and just make some excuse for why you cannot get your old records. Lie and say you have dual citizenship and just got back from a decade abroad etc.

1. How would he find what is in an Oxycodone? He thinks there is oxycodone, but he is trying to find what fillers are added to it.

a. He would also like to find the (not sure how to say this properly) what dissolves what in the makeup.

b. He has used 93% grain Alcohol to dissolve 10mg Ritalin IR, powdered, dissolved, filtered and let air dry until it is a dry power. It packs a punch, but his yield is only about 40%. He was thinking maybe he did not let it dissolve long enough? Any other idea?

2) If he uses the same process on the Oxycodone.

a. Would you use 93% grain alcohol or just water (like CWE) to dissolve?

b. Do you think the product would be a better snort that just crushed? Could you base it?

I dosed 1mg sub a few hours ago, no relief but my pupils are normal sized. I havent dosed meth in over 12 hours. I have been trying to sleep since then so i can start feeling better. 

I want to obviously take more sub til im not sick still, but it almost seemed like the 1mg of bupe caused the meth to kick back in again harder... 

My question: does bupe do anything positive or negative to meth comedown? I was hoping it might help me sleep, i took a large amount of medibles and it seemed to stim me up more too. Anything i can do to knock me out?

No benzos on hand or even meletonin. I figure that my brain heals during sleep so tomorrow i will feel more like day 6 of opiate withdrawal instead of like day 1 still. ",1536606379.0

Tomorrow I have to get on a plane to go visit my girlfriends sister. It won't be a long flight and it is not international. We are leaving from the Baltimore airport.


I have a little over a g of dope that I am gonna have to stretch to keep me well out there. I am trying to figure out how to get this past the airport security. We are only bringing carry on bags. Normally when I go anywhere with my dope, I keep it in a crotch pocket. For those of you who don't know, a crotch pocket is made by cutting a horizontal slit in the flap of fabric that is behind the crotch zipper on pants/jeans. You just tuck your shit down there, zip your pants up, and you are good to go. I was planning on doing this until I found out about the full body scanner thing. It's got me a bit worried. I haven't been shooting my dope the last several months (trying to ultimately cut back and quit) and have just been sniffing it, so I don't need to worry about rigs. 



Does any one have any tips or insight as to how i may be able to pull this off? I have no connections where I am traveling to so I kind of need to bring or else be in nasty withdrawals the entire time I am there.


Any help would be appreciated.



Thanks!

EDIT#2: Just a little update. I am at the airport and made it through security. They did in fact have the body scanner. I went with ""put my dope in capsules method"". I had a bottle of 5-HTP vitamins, and the powder with in the capsules was almost identical in color to my dope (light brown). Mixed 3 dope capsules in with the other 15 or so caps of 5-HTP left in the bottle. For good measure I brought two other bottles of different vitamins. I put all three bottles in my carry, and the people scanning the bag didn't even give it a second thought. Suffice to say, this method works very well. 10/10, would recommend.",1536590378.0

Location-specific usernames are no longer being permitted to post here, and will be asked to make a new username and banned as of 9/10/18. Any accounts like this created after then is automatically in violation once we catch it, and will be PMed by one of the mods asked to come back with a different name and banned. These kind of usernames are causing problems for multiple reasons. 

Older accounts in violation that have established karma/post history here may be granted an exception at mod discretion, but for the most part any names like this will not be permitted go post here even if no rules have been broken yet. 


The types of names not allowed and the reasons they are not allowed should be obvious, but here is clarification: 

-examples not allowed: this includes usernames (that are often created with rulebreaking intentions) such as: obvious ones like ""dopesickinXcity"", ""needHinATL"", ""LAoxyplug"" etc; and some less obvious but still not OK names that include area codes, zip codes, etc. or usernames that arent location based but are along the lines of ""PMmeforheroin"" etc. that are clearly intending to source here. Names with just a state in them may be granted an exception at mod-discretion. 

- reasons for this rule: 1) they are often obvious with intentions to break rules 2) they invite potential sourcing from others near you 3) they very often end up leading to location discussion and comments that violate our sourcing, location, or meetup policies and put the entire sub at risk.

At first I didn't.. I hope I feel differently when I awake or at least not so fucking bad about it. 


Basically, yesterday (Saturday) Cliff rang my doorbell. I opted not answer the door, despite it being obvious ppl were home.. I mean like the fucking front window was open. Unless he didn't look up, it was quite obvious.

I didn't know what to do when he rang but I didn't want to come to the door. I hate being at a disadvantage as he's the type to say ""I have an emergency"" and many times I've regretted availing myself for ""emergencies"", or at least realized they were not emergencies either way. Sometimes not even all to inconvenient.


Well whatever, I could go all day. This is is the exact thought which makes me well up with sadness...


#The other day...

Cliff rang my doorbell, I didn't respond. I ran to grab a towel to pretend I was in the shower so that I could say ""I'll swing by to talk later"" and so he wouldn't enter my house with is bed bugs. Then I decided not to bother answering because I didn't want to bother visiting his house to find out some bullshit. well actually, I was on the fence. I texted that I had work and would swing by before work.

&nbsp;
**I checked the front door surveillance camera, and he was standing there..**  I still didn't know what I wanted to do, I just wanted it to end. I checked again and he stood in my driveway a few seconds. Then I texted that I'd swing by around 4pm and he didn't respond... maybe he got the message, maybe his phone was shot.

&nbsp;

Goddamit I feel so awful about this even though the preponderance of history says I really shouldn't. I should be continuing to rejoice that I haven't been dope-sick and that I haven't gotten shafted into pissing way money. 

&nbsp;

I set a reminder to try and make amends tomorrow... at least drop him off a replacement power cord for his computer even though he's a careless slob. I want to do something right to offset the guilt I feel but nothing more as such wouldn't be in my interests. ughhhhh...fuck fuck fuck. This is so fucking paradoxical.

I feel so bad just assuming he's up to no good, or up to something that will annoy the shit out of me but what if he just wanted to check in as a friend? I mean probably not but goddamit I'm in a thought loop. Until I go to find out I wont know either way and will be burdened with guild. Yet it's probably more logical just to push through the guilt and to move on while I can because being cordial might get pounced on.

I‚Äôm going into a rehab in 2 weeks, & honestly, it couldn‚Äôt have come at a better time-I don‚Äôt get any euphoria or enjoyment out of this, esp since they changed up the damn formula.

My question is has anyone ever experienced this? It looks brown & flaky & u think it‚Äôd be good stuff but it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs either the cut (I can hear something almost *crunching* when I go to chop it up), or something. The feeling is so bad & uncomfortable I gotta breathe really deep to level myself. And bf anyone says, just stop-that‚Äôs actually why I‚Äôve been taking just small bumps to stave off sickness, so that should tell you how awful the feeling is. 

Thanks for the input, stay safe!",1536505713.0

So i tried these pills for the first time a month ago. I took half a pill for my first time. However the second time I took whole pill. Basically oxy/naloxone extended release pill. 20mg oxy/10mg naloxone. Everything was fine until next day when the pill wear off. At first I was just feeling nauseous and dizzy, but that went away in 30 mins. At the evening, I got this terrible burning sensation in lower abdomen and my left testicle was in so much pain. What could be wrong? I don't mind nausea but abdomen pain was really terrible, I thought I was gonna die. This time I decided to try crush the pill, so I make it immediate release, because I didnt get much euphoria last time, was only super relaxed. I also didnt get nauseous during high the last time I tried it but like next day later in the evening.. Any advice? Is there any way to prevent abdomen pain? Drinking a lot maybe?

The last couple years I've used Kratom and benzos to help my withdrawls but I've never been in a MAT program . I've never been to rehab and only been to NA a few random times.  I don't have any user friends, I live in a small mountain town in the Northern Cascades and make the monthly 2 hour drive to the nearest metropolis to buy a piece of tar.  (24 grams for $900).

I've tried countless times to get clean on my own but I've finally admitted to myself I need help. My family is really pushing me to go on methadone.

The horror stories about how methadone gets its claws into you are a little unnerving and I am scared I am trading a daily habit of BTH for a methadone addiction that will sink its claws in to me much deeper than the tar ever did.    Because I have no user friends I am not able to get any perspective other than the treatment community and some doctors.. who I just don't trust all the way.

If he was in the car I know he woulda said drive away I just know it.  I could have easily driven away but I didn't !! He gave me a free one of for not driving away.  He also could have probably found out where i lived and bc he dealt with a handful of people who did.  I didn't have my own place at the time, I lived with my rents.  Either way there was probably alot of things I coulda done in that situation but I just didn't.  What would you do?",1536455948.0

I recently went on about a 14-18 day streak of shooting heroin about .3-.5 a day with the occasional day off here and there 
I still have Kratom but I have acquired 3 and half 8mg suboxone. 
What would be the best way to stretch out 28mgs
I know after 2 weeks or so isn‚Äôt that long and the sickness won‚Äôt be as bad as it‚Äôs been before when I was using heavy amounts for years but what would be the best way to taper the 28mgs 

Thanks you for anyone who has any input ",1536454383.0
