I guess I'd like opinions but maybe I just want to vent. Feel free to ignore.,"Edit: TLDR: Well fuck. I'm high as shit shooting coke and dope while drinking Jameson and I'm having a great time while also not having such a great time??? I also feel that TLDR's should be at the top? Is that just me?

I got out of rehab for the third time in May of this year, I went in four days before my birthday. As opposed to the other two times, I was kind of taking it seriously. Well just a little more serious. I want to get sober so my stressed out father can deal with his problems without worrying about whether I'm going to be alive the next day. 

Before the second time in rehab I got a dui cause I drank a lot at work so I could sleep that night as I was getting dopesick and couldn't pick up till the morning before work the next day. Got arrested kind of but managed to make it back to my fathers house while drunk as shit, woke up in the morning to him sitting on my bed saying ""call your boss, you're not going into work."" 

This is going somewhere i promise.

While in rehab the second time my father politely let me know I gotta figure out something for living, cause I cant do it at his house anymore. I understood why, I wasnt that upset about it. I mean shit I almost killed myself driving drunk and I could have easily killed somebody else. 

SO I found a recovery house about an hour south of where I lived before and some people I met said it was a good place. So fuck it, I could find a job quick and find my own place to move into in 6 or 10 months and I'll have my license back by then, perfect. 

Barely a month in and a relapse on dope, start right away with the needles, and a good thing for that I did three buns and got high m once in the two days I had it for. All around pointless. So I get randomly dayberug
ugh that I probably could have gotten away with saying I didnt do anything and they would have believed me, but I'm a bad liar and I know that.

Go back to rehab under the same company but it was their new location a state and a couple hours west. This place was huge and fancy blah blah two TVS in every room blah blah. I meet my therapist and this guy was probably the best person  I could have had in this place, knew exactly how to talk to me so I didnt pussyfoot around what I should be talking about.

After a couple weeks I get the feeling that I want to get on with this a live sober, first time I genuinely had that though so that's important I think. I eventually come to the conclusion that I hate the house I was at and planned on going back to (sharing a large 3 story house with 27 other men is fucking rough.) And I decided to make some positive changes that might help my attitude towards all this sobriety bull shit. 

With the help of my therapist I find a house that he says I would love, real close to a big east coast city and I've always wanted to live in a city so I was excited about this step closer to where I want to be. And he knows that because he olwas one of the first people to live there when it first opened. And I trust this ex- Green Beret motherfucker so I went for it.

Turns out I loved the house and had no problem staying sober here, I found a kickass job that was going to teach me everything about making sushi so I was actually fucking happy. I got 90 days sober which was the longest I've had since I started using. About 2 months into living here some went down and I failed a UA for opiates but i really didnt use. So i get kicked out on the spot.

I was already half ass looking for a new place so i didnt have trouble finding a place that told me i could move in next week. And i already made some good friends and one of them offered to let me stay in her basement until I find my new place. So I wasnt going to actually be homeless which was nice, but everything still fucking sucked.

Two days into staying at this girls house, I figured out where to cop and got some dope that turned out to be real strong fent, I was shooting like 1/3rd of a bag and nodding. Well whatever, now I'm sitting in my new apartment shooting speedball, which I've never even done before somebody on the street offered me soft so I figure I'd try it.

But boy am I sad. My poor father just wants me to be alive, I don't necessarily want to die but when I start using I dont really want to live either. I already owe so much money to rehab that I know for certain I cant swing that again and come out anywhere near on top. Well fuck.

Also edit: If someone just wants to talk to me about something completely irrelevant I would love that. Thanks you beautiful people.g",1535074249.0

I have some limited experience with both as I successfully used DCK for tolerance which helped. I snorted the dose and didn't use any more opiates that day, and it helped me to lower tolerance from 75-100mg a shot to 50mg which was the dose I started with (ie the dose I was taking when I first started using morphine). That was about 2 months after I started taking opiates daily.

I've also used ketamine for managing tolerance (I injected around 35mg) which didn't really help (I used morphine around 3 hours after K).

I took the same dose of ketamine few days later and it helped me with withdrawals (I've been using morphine (at doses around 300mgs daily) and other opiates for 4 months at the time). I haven't experienced any physical symptoms but mentally I didn't make it and started using morphine again after 3 days.

What are your experiences? Do you have any research papers on that matter? How should I administer ketamine to lower tolerance?",1535068011.0

There is no room for feelings or weakness. Many have been consumed by its vast pitfalls. Many still dance on the edges of certain doom. But there is a power that comes from knowing how to navigate in the danger, and it becomes intoxicating. Regular life, the life of a ‚Äúcitizen‚Äù as I have come to describe it, loses its flavor. One begins to crave the taste of risk, the rush of broken laws and the way surviving the street each day feels like destiny manifested. 
But after so long, inevitably the rush and the euphoria fades, just like the chemicals one may have been seeking when he first began to foray into the street. Things we are so quick to take for granted in our old lives disappear, like regular hygiene and steady employment. The chaos wears us thin, and we begin to shut off more and more to the outside world, receding deep within where physical and emotional pain can no longer hurt us. We worship at the feet of a god who knows not our name or our path. We drill down onto whatever false savior we have aligned ourselves to with the focus of a surgeon. Our salvation is always within our reach, in the bottle or the pipe or the needle. It never judges. It never questions. It never notices.
When the day of reckoning arrives, if one is fortunate enough to reach that day, it is a stark and terrifying truth we are forced to confront. The drugs stop working. The bonds and the routines betray us, and we are once again empty, stumbling deeper into the vast emptiness of our own tattered souls. Two paths are presented. One is the path we have been running from for so long, we know immediately where it leads. It is the path of living a purpose driven life, filled with obligation, accomplishment, love, disappointment, plans for the future, failure, despair, joy, and so much more. The path to a life lived is one we have the greatest fear of taking. 
The other path, dark and treacherous, beckons to us, but we can feel the danger and the deceit that hides along its jagged rocky outcroppings. This is the path to death. A sad and lonely death is the only destination. Usually those who choose this second path are the catalyst that rockets them toward that shallow grave. It‚Äôs is the only escape for the lost and broken soul who can no longer find refuge in the false gods he once served. 
The human mind and body are not indestructible; there is a limit to the amount of suffering and utter despair one can endure. Offer prayers of love and forgiveness for those of us who have given in to the path of oblivion, for no earthly creature can truly say they have found true peace. No one can save a man who has journeyed down the path of oblivion, and too often it is true that turning back becomes impossible. Mercy and peace to them all. Mercy and peace to the livers of life as well. Both paths require courage and fortitude. Both are harrowing and often offer no quarter.",1535064418.0

I call him back and he tell me thats wat i ASKed 4. I ask if he has some dope and he says he just got rid of it. so I end up gettting some later in the nihgt fromhim and keep the crack and smoke booth for a few days. after 3 weeks of being couped up in a hotel getting ripped off from the dope he was delling me I called my doan clinic to get back enrolled. since then my life has been stable and I havent had any set backs in terms of legal problems or relapses. i still smoke weed and take doan.

Seems H can get out of hand real quick and tolerance obviously builds fast so i got up to about a bundle a day. I definitely don't feel like i NEED a bundle to avoid sickness and assume half of that would be sufficient enough to avoid sickness while dropping my tolerance but unsure as its my first time doing this.

Can anyone recommend a practical plan for someone whos been doign a bundle a day for about 2 months? should i cut it in half for a week and then drop 25% per week from there on out? would love some tips from veterans, thank you.

TLDR: What % of a drop from daily use would you recommend for someone trying to ween off of a bundle per day habit? Been snorting this amount for about 2 months. I assume its not very strong stuff either in case that matters, don't have much to compare it to...

I will say that speed was a much more toxic addiction for me than opiates, that stuff drove me crazy and very easy to lose control of your mind(amp psychosis) and make your appearance look terrible. This lasted 2 years and i had developed a huge auxiety disorder and felt terrible( panic attacks when i was out couldnt sleep),this led to me standing with my Mom talking next thing i know im on the ground(Huge headrush and lost control of my body). i checked into detox for 5 days  after that, they gave me 2 10mg valium during my stay. Havent touched speed or alcohol since.

&#x200B;

Downers,psychedelics, and valhalla  

When i got out i went to my doctor and explained my situation and was prescribed .5mg clonazepam 4x daily for my auxiety. It worked and the cravings for speed and alcohol left completly. Benzos Benzos Benzos goddawn i thought quitting speed was hard, anyone whos been on heavy does of benzos for months on end knows what i mean when you quit cold turkey. My girlfriend recommended shrooms and that changed my whole life(i looked at myself in a new perspective and didnt like what i seen) stopped benzos completly(still use Xanax every now and then) and went on a journey through my mind-acid mescaline   and god of them all DMT(what a trip). No more auxiety since none its almost like the DMT changed something in my brain and i was at peace with myself and still am( this is not a sad story im doing great which is why im writing this).

At this stage im 20 have a great job, great girlfriend, my own place life is good and still is. I was out moutain biking and hit a turn and ran straight into a thick branch of a tree. Broke my collarbone ( doctor gave me nothing but anti infammitory) but my friend gave me some perks 5/325. Holy Fuck is all i have to say about the first time i got high on opiods it felt like heaven on earth and in my mind was the perfect high. Started getting 25 every month and would take around 20mg a day till i ran out. Best sex of my life was on Oxycodone i dont know if its just me but does it ever put me on that level. This went on for 6 months or so but after awhile i found out that the tylenol was bad for my liver so on to oxycontin. But it was discontined and i hate Neos they make me itch soo bad. As some of you know there still going strong in other parts of world.

&#x200B;

At this stage im 21 still have my job, a different girlfriend, and still renting my own place and getting 14 O.C 80s every month. Im using 40mg a day(still do) and living my life happily. I take a 2 week break every 2 months.

Here i am at 24 still doing the same thing and still on my same dose every night when i get off work. I have my own house now and a new car thats paid off no girlfriend atm though. Oxycodone seems to not affect me like the speed or benzos, im addicted no question but im a functioning addict and healthy person for the most part. The reason im writing this is because everywhere i read that if your on opiates your gonna end up shooting up and ruining your life etc etc. In my opinion through my 4 years of use opiods are not hard on your body and you can live your life perfectly fine while on them. I find with opiods you just have to take breaks so your dopamine has time to recover. Iv only ever used them orally and at my height was using an 80 a day.   Have any of you had the same experience? Have any of you been able to go 10 years while being a functioning addict compared to my 4? I feel like opiates get a bad rap but when your not to greedy and live a healthy lifestyle you can function just fine in my opinion. Im sorry for the long post thank you for any input:)

Will post some pics once i fugure out how to do it discreetly.

I was all over the place when I wrote that post. I didn‚Äôt know how to cope. My mum got diagnosed with cancer, I found out that my wife beating alcohol father who who presumed missing only died a died a few weeks ago and my sister died two weeks ago. They‚Äôve changed the immigration laws in oz, despite the fact that my son, partner and ex partner are all Australian it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a job despite being highly qualified. I‚Äôm very well known in another field and got fucked over brutally in ways I cannot describe because someone women choose to us their vagina and a demonstration of their talent. 

I get the impression that some people get preferential treatment on here. Stories of people losing custody of their children, losing their children altogether, getting away with major felonies as well as stories of extreme violence towards other individuals and leavings others to do OD. 

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, i don‚Äôt want it in any shape or form.

I wrote the post in a rush as I needed to vent to a community that i thought would understand the plight of an addict. Let me clarify a few things. I hadn‚Äôt taken taken anything except the cannabis which I was did not intentionally take. Not an excuse. I see so many posts about people driving high or after having taken a shot and most don‚Äôt get the same reactions. My last dose of Xanax was 36 hours before the incident. My lose dose of H was 8 hours before the incident. I did not take any in my kids presence and never did and have never have. I was starting to go through mild WDs. I‚Äôve been using for two months after my ten year relapse. Not an an excuse but I had no idea the vape pen had cannabis in it. 

A lot of things were phrased incorrectly, i was just telling you guys what I had left and wondering what to do what that gram. I‚Äôve sold it to a some guy who used to middle for me and using the money for therapy. 

The child was born without my consent. The court granted me full custody but a child needs his father and and I never had one growing up. He sought therapy, worked on himself and became a better person. 

The police got me to drive physically get into the car and drive it into a safer spot. My encounters with the NSW police has not been great in the past- they didn‚Äôt give a shit when all my my stuff got robbed or when I got mugged but they were amazing. They‚Äôre experienced enough to not to let someone who is fucked up beyond belief not to do that. 

The hospital and police report says I suffered from a seizure. They both noted my my first priority was my child and that he was an extremely happy young boy with a strong bond towards me. 

When I said the gram is gone and I‚Äôm done, I meant either sell it or flush it. I chose the former and used the money for CBT.

I‚Äôm not a nasty or malicious person. I give and I give until nothing is gone. I have my child my life even thought he was the product of rape the best that I could. When I‚Äôm at my lowest I always help others. I have never ever reached out to anyone for help. Any time I reached out for help to my mother, it was a torrent of abuse, malice and insults for something as simple as wanting a little bit of a help with my maths tests or picking an outfit. My life was strictly controlled to every extent despite having started school two years early and excelling beyond belief. Last night‚Äôs post has taught me that reaching out for help or venting no matter what will bring me back to square one. 

Medical professionals often treat us like scum because they‚Äôve never been there. A huge part of me wants to call it quits because this isn‚Äôt something i can do alone. You guys are right, I am a piece of shit and my loved ones are better off without me. I can‚Äôt do this alone. You guys are right, I‚Äôm just a junkie piece of shit who doesn‚Äôt deserve anyone around me.

I sincerely hope that those trying or struggling to stay clean get there. Shoot me a message while I‚Äôm still around if you need to vent. ",1535011064.0

The grateful dead have become the band people patronize through jokes about drug filled fans who only love songs so long cause the drugs.

The grateful dead created alternative rock music and the idea of concerts. They played bluegrass before becoming the dead. They took weekend festivals bluegrass bands began in rhe early 60s and decided rock music should have the same. So they pulled together Monterey pop, Altamont, the free love in, sunshine day dream, and. Even the Woodstock promoters got help from the band/band,manager.

Their philosophy has always been making a living through ticket sales. Real musicians play live and sound better,than any studio recordings. It's impossible to recreate the synergy, chemistry a band gets playing live.  They have acoustic ballads, country songs, blues songs, jazz songs, covers, funk, first adopters of electronic music ( now edm.), they have songs 4 minutes long to 48 minute long meditative journeys, pop songs, old rock n roll songs, blue grass songs, and psychadelic space time ripping orchestras your brain can only hold on to as it makes you dive deep in the brain.  

They have over 2400 songs in their catalog.  They never play a song the same way twice. A song played Friday night might have a guitar solo in a completely different scale mode/category/type Tuesday night's version has. Played by the piano between a different verse too.

They improv together and the songs are long because they either jam one song into another, or write songs meant to morph into the next without stopping. I often find myself holding my breath, or feel my heart beating through my chest when they play. They build up whole concerts with separate waves of energy over 6 to 8 hours. Slowly building to songs rocking like the freebird solo speed, or so delicate, one tickle of the piano ivory keeps the beat of an old gospel tune.


The dead had 4 main singers. Jerry is only one of the two main. Bobby is the other and I prefer his songs better. They were forced to after their main singer died in 72. In the 80 to 90s, young Brent brought his songs and voice.


Listen to them. I guarantee they're not at all what you expect. Lmk and ill give you a show to listen to. Live is how thru want to listen. They've always encouraged the audience to record and give the shows away for free. From 65 to 95. Every show is available for free and the soundboard recording to. Pristine.

Even the acid tests. Where you bought a ticket and you got a cup out of multiple huge trash cans filled with koolaid and lsd.


Unfortunately, jerry died when he checked into rehab. His heart gave out starting his detox. He started smoking heroin in the late 70 s and continued off and on til his death. Brent died of a speed ball too. The rest of the members ALWAYS tried getting,them to stick to anything but dope. I'm with them.


Get at me. I bought my first live show at Xmas at 14. I still listen to the dead and the stories their songs tell are priceless. Songs for any situation in life. 

Tldr: listen to the dead. People always connect the dead to heroin. I wanted to clarify it was only a big part of jerry's life and he didnt shoot it. He also died trying to get clean.",1534988671.0

How many baggies to get charged with selling?,"I live in WA state for the record. Like do they test an already cleaned off baggy for for microscopic residue just to charge you or can you have a tiny bit on you and not get charged etc.? I'm asking cause my purse has a secret pocket (I guess not so secret now) I made that I keep things like my hit kit and tooters (for smoking,) any other random paranaphelia and small amounts of drugs (which I also keep in a separate hiding place in my purse.) The drugs are usually meth and sometimes heroin. I know that people aren't idiots though and could probably notice things like there being things in my purse if they were looking through it that they can't seem to find if they touched it which would lead them to the ""secret"" pocket so I'm just wondering if I shouldn't keep like old bags and slightly dirty tooters that may have residue on them in case I get searched (why do people get searched anyway, like for what reason could a cop search me and my stuff?) Is there a certain number of baggies you can have on you cause I heard if you had a certain amount (I""m not sure how much though) you'd get charged with selling but those things accumulate fast when you buy small bags and my mom spends most of her time at home so it's hard to clean out my purse at least really frequently (our walls are thin.) And how much time do you think I would be looking at if I did get caught with them? I know it sounds pretty fucking dumb to carry those things around in your purse but I live with my parents and they don't know as far as I know and so I can't do them in the house when they're not there and it looks normal to leave with my purse or a backpack as apposed to my hit kit out in the open etc. I can also bring my purse into the bathroom and still look normal so they don't go through it and throw out my stuff when I'm taking a shower and stuff so it has it's advantages too. My parents do know that I have a past at least with drugs though just fyi so I bet they do go through my stuff when I'm not there  bc they did even before I started doing hard drugs.

I've never had any run-ins with the law besides speeding tickets and I don't want that to change.

I'm looking for advice but I'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit to post asking this. I'll go into more detail if needed but here's a TLDR at the beginning to save you a read: to sum things up, I have severe pain in both my hands as well as wide spread aches and stiffness in my entire body, though not as severe as my hands. My bones feel like dust. I feel like I've been poisoned down to my bones. I've had a plethora of tests done and they havnt shown anything so far. My doctor refuses to give me any opiates stronger than Tramadol. What can I do to get stronger painkillers or even better any idea what might be wrong with me and how I can cure it so I don't need painkillers?

My doctor incorrectly believes tramadol is not addictive though it definitely is. I took it years ago for back pain and had horrible withdrawals when I came off it. He gave me a weeks worth of oxycontin when I first presented with the severe hand pain and it's only gotten worse since then. He gave me oxycontin 10mg twice daily as I was in tears the pain was so severe. It helped a little but now he's refusing to give me anything other than Tramadol and/or anti-inflammatorys despite the fact I told him they are barely touching the pain and have awful side effects. (Brain zaps and affecting my mood). Im talking 100mg tramadol 3 times a day so quite a large dose bit it's barely helping at all. He won't even give me codeine for some bizarre reason even though it's weaker than Tramadol. I've taken that before and never had the same negative side effects that tramadol causes. I've tried talking to him and rayionalising the situation and begging and talking some more and he won't even let me talk/ask about a morphine based stronger opiate anymore. All of this is really starting to stress me out and I feel incredibly sad hopeless and depressed. He keeps going on about my age and how I shouldn't be taking these at my age (I'm 26 but feel 80 right now). I don't see how it matters what age I am as the medicine I'm asking for is addictive to anyone who uses it whether young or old. The pain is so bad now I feel like I'm unable to work. Though obviously I have to work to keep an income. He keeps blaming the medicine board and regulations but it seems like a lie to me or an excuse not to help me. There has been new regulations regarding strong medications like oxycontin being prescribed for short term use only in my country. So I get his point that when the tests aren't pointing to any particular problem he can't really prescribe me strong medication regularly or atleast it's difficult to do so and would attract unwanted attention. But this seems ridiculous to me at the same time because I can barely dress myself in the morning which is not normal for someone my age and it's clear I need something stronger when I'm so much suffering. It feels like hes just covering his own ass and not eilling to help me. He's not even trying to treat the problem in other ways though. I've had to ask him to do tests and explain how medicines work to him. I explained that the side effects tramadol were causing me were likely due to its SSRI activity. He said its not an SSRI. I had to explain to him for 10mins over the phone it was and eventually told him to read the wikipedia page. To his shock it said it was a weak SSRI and he then thought i studied pharmacology. Whereas its basic googling my medication before I take it knowledge. His medical knowledge seems incredibly out-dated. After learning a little bit more about the medication he prescribes probably ten times a day to different patients he still refused to give me something else. Why even give me the week of oxycontin to begin with if it so worrying to him?

I only got an x-ray done on my hands literally today, I had also to ask for it to be done, surely it should be standard practise to give someone an x-ray on day 1 and not after three months of suffering? So ya, this has been ongoing constant severe pain for three months and I feel like I'm going crazy. I honestly can't take it anymore. Before you say it also doesn't seem to be mental illness related, as no matter how stressed or down or happy I feel on any given day. The pain is still there. I can be very stressed or upset and it does not get worse. It has however steadily been getting worse over time. When my hands first got sore it was just mild stiffness and I felt no need to go to the doctor or even take an ibuprofen, but now I can barely use my phone. It is a huge effort to type all this out so thank you for baring with me.

I dont have the technical names for the tests to hand right now but I can get these if needed. Tests done so far include: white blood cells, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, inflammation, vitamin levels, mineral levels and all other standard blood tests. According to all these tests I am perfectly healthy and show no signs of inflammation. However my hands and feet do swell up every now and again so I don't understand how I have no inflammation whatsoever. I'm in constant pain all the time, aches and bad stiffness all over my body. I sleep ok and eat relatively healthy. I also have a bad, sharp, pain in my neck. Widespread muscle tension, fatigue and occasional nausea. It feels like I've had the flu and two broken hands for months now. Pain does not travel down my entire arms so it doesn't appear to be a pinched nerve in my neck causing the hand pain. It is just isolated severe pain from my wrists to my fingers. 

I was also referred to a private rheumatologist. This was also no help whatsoever. He charged me a small fortune for a short ten minute meeting and told me I have tennis elbow and fibromyalgia, he conducted just one test: patting and squeezing my arms. He squeezed a pressure point on my elbow very hard and I said ""ow!"". He later didn't seem to listen to me when I said my elbows were fine that it was my hands that hurt. He then proceeded to give me a steroid injection into each elbow and prescribed me low dose naltrexone. This didnt help at all. Naltrexone is not a licenced treatment for either fibromyalgia or tennis elbow either. Neither of these diagnosis really match up with my symptoms either but maybe im biased because I dont like that theres no test for fibromyalgia. But that's besides the point. That was the only treatment I've received beside painkillers and anti infammatorys and nothings working. There is no test for fibromyalgia so it sounds like a bit of a throwaway diagnosis to me. I feel like the doctors just can't figure out what's wrong with me so they do and say whatever they can to get rid of me or pass me onto someone else and just don't try and help me. I'm spending so much money on all of this. I'm giving my resignation into work tomorrow because I can't cope with it any longer. It's too painful and I'm missing too much days as it is. It doesn't seem right to stay on the payroll when I'm missing so much days.

I am waiting for blood tests results for haemochromatosis, vitamin D deficiency, and thyroid function. I had to ask my doctor to do these tests, he doesn't seem to have any ideas of his own, he doesn't make suggestions to try and figure out what's wrong with me. These could be likely culprits as I'm from Ireland and they are quite common in Irish people apparently. But I'm worried nothing will show up again and I'll be left to suffer with no help treatment or cure in sight.

Does anyone know how I can convince my doctor to give me stronger painkillers? Should I stop seeing him and go to another doctor? Does anyone know what might be wrong with me? Most important question but a long shot - does anyone know what could cure me so I don't need to take painkillers?",1534973346.0

A quote once said: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go looking for happiness in all the places that made you lose it‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been taking the steps to not do that in life. But the only temporary feeling of normal emotions (including sadness and not limited to happiness) was when I was on some kind of opioid/opiate. 

Yesterday I felt some normality again and felt sad right after knowing once the Vicodin and Valium wear off, I‚Äôm back to this robotic state: *numb and empty* ‚Äîyet full of so many thoughts.

And I‚Äôve been on Suboxone for over 3 months now after I stopped because I‚Äôm heading to the military to learn discipline without having my parents alive and all. My support systems feel so distant to me. 

And all these feelings; I know I‚Äôm not the only one to experience them: so this means that someone found a way out of feeling like this. Yet I can‚Äôt seem to.

I just dosed a drug that I almost hate and I am prescribed, *Adderall*20mg, and it only lasts about two hours; then a blanket of total sadness came over me again: I can‚Äôt talk, I feel this impending sadness, tears stuck that I confused that feeling of wanting to cry for wanting to puke ‚Äîall while sitting on the couch with my family I haven‚Äôt saw in a while.

I took my Valium with it too to mellow out. But then now, about 4 hours later I take another dose because I couldn‚Äôt shake that feeling of wanting to cry for minutes on minutes. 

And it really seems Suboxone only works for me for about 3 days or so before pooping out.. I feel no different on or off it. So I‚Äôm 5 days about without it now.

And then I have my girlfriend bitching at me on the phone while she‚Äôs at work saying how my actions effect others, I didn‚Äôt go up to get my Suboxone filled, I keep missing appointments ‚Äîand I‚Äôm 100% aware of the consequences of my actions but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck. I can‚Äôt even lift a limb. 
It‚Äôs like a ‚Äúpsychomotor retardation‚Äù feeling is the best way I can describe it.

No amount of time at therapy as helped me through this. Not any medications except temporarily using them: their effects diminish after a few days. A daily regimen feels imperative.

The dinging is quickly pushed out of my head as My body reminds me that I‚Äôm sick...I hadn‚Äôt forgotten and I can‚Äôt wait another second. I know this is a major nono and my dboy would chew me a new asshole and probably block my number if he found out I was getting ready to use in the stairwell but all that could be dealt with once I had gotten well.


I worked quickly and soon enough I had it all laid out ready to go. I ready my straw bring my phone screen up and as I hear another annoying. DING! I inhale, no better feelings exists  then when you go from Sick to well.  I honestly can‚Äôt think of a single thing that is better. I hurriedly get the deed done and begin my descent down the piss smelling and cigarette butt laden staircase. I hit the first floor and walk back into the sun. Only this time it‚Äôs not oppressive and unbearable like it had been just 5 minutes earlier! 
 
Now  I embraced the warmth and the rays of light danced and flickered through the leaves of the trees. I could feel my legs starting to regain strength, the cramps in my calves finally subsiding thank god! I cross the street to the corner deli looking for the homeless kid I‚Äôve seen the last few days, I had planned on buying him a cig and some lunch but he was no where to be found. I gave up went in the deli got myself a dew code red and 5 looseys and went on my way lighting up a cig as started to walk towards to subway. 

This was the most rundown ghetto part of town I had ever been in while doing dope. I would never bring my gf (my ex gfi mean) down here. One cause I don‚Äôt want her to see that besides the color of my skin I fit in pretty well down here. I made that mistake once before showing of my knowledge of the shit part of queens. It didn‚Äôt go over well and was met with a lot of suspicion. The other reason was I didn‚Äôt want things to go wrong while  I was here and her ending up hurt or robbed. 

As I walked a homeless woman approached me asking to by her a metro card when I told her I had planned in hopping the turnstile she then asked for a dollar when I reiterated that I was JUMPING THE TURNSTILE, she then focus on what was left of my cigarette. Out of pure aggravation I gave her what was left maybe 1/4 of a Newport. I pulled a very English move an tutted as I walked away upset that I once again felt compelled to give away my hard earned cigarette. These people don‚Äôt realize that 9/10 they have more money than I do. That soon enough I would be on the streets with them. Why? Because drugs. Drugs always seem to take precedence. I‚Äôll look for a job once I get well I tell myself daily. Then I get well and no job is searched for...

Anyways. I walk back to the subway realizing I had a few more dollars than I normally do I went to McDonald‚Äôs to eat. Again my first meal in about 18 hours. I do another bag in the bathroom when I arrive but for once I intend on sticking around and buying something. 

After I eat and smoke a second cig I descend into the subway to hop a train and begin the long grueling subway ride back to where I live. And that‚Äôs where I am right now. Sitting on an uptown 4 express train waiting patiently to get back home. Where reality surely awaits me.

I'm coming to you as a sister of someone who IVs Heroin and Meth. A short background: He's been in the life for about 8 years. Been to rehab 2 times and had a year sobriety about 5 years ago. He then began a relationship with a woman and it is toxic. They began to use together and have been for quite sometime now. Things recently came to a head. They're broke, fight all the time, his health is shit, and her kids have been taken away (which he was really invested in). We have known he was using again as it became very obvious, but recently learned that he was now doing meth too. So the question is:

As a user, what would it take for you to go to treatment? NOT what is your bottom, but how can we approach treatment with him that will give us a better chance to support him and get him there.

How would you want someone to offer a non-judgemental hand? 

In the past we have used tough love, we have no leverage. He talks about going but feels guilty for leaving his girlfriend at her lowest, (may just be an excuse). Is it a good idea to help her find treatment too? She is not close with us and really distances herself because of the drugs. 

Our current approach is letting him open up to us which seems to be working but very slow. His life is running out, we cant wait anymore. He legit could be dead right now and we wouldn't even know. 

Any thoughts welcome. Stay safe friends.",1534960151.0

So I had accumulated some clean time and felt the need to reward myself obviously (junkie logic) leading me to drive into the nearby city with a decent hood to score in. The shit is pretty much all dope/fent or pure fent down here in Florida. Head to my usual spot, start walking around and getting asked what I needed but I'm a pretty discerning customer when cold copping (been burned by weak/bunk product too many times to count) so I mostly refused and kept searching for someone familiar. Finally saw a group of guys I'd cold copped from a bunch of times and their shit was always straight so I bought a bunch and headed back to my car. I no longer had an apartment in the city so I drove to a nearby spot I used to use to fix when I would be in withdrawal because while I totally disagree with driving high, I think we can all agree driving after you've gotten right is MUCH safer than driving in withdrawal. 

  
Parked my car and turned on some jams. I was expecting to fix and then go for a walk and get some food or just enjoy the city since I didn't want to be driving if I was actually high (it's not like I was in withdrawal and getting right). Did my usual ritual, prepped the shot, found a vein which was super easy since I'd be clean everything had healed pretty nicely and shot up a baggie. Normally, a bag is enough to get me well and in my excitement from copping for the first time in a while and preparing to get fucked up, I forgot to account for the fact I had absolutely no tolerance and a single bag from these guys would have me nodding hard/knocked out when I was shooting $100/day. 

  
The last thing I remember thinking is ""Wow this is really good shit I'm super fucked up"" and then there's literally nothing. It's just like there's a hole in my memory until I feel something on my face and I try to pull it off and someone goes to stop me. That's when I realize I'm lying in the back of an ambulance on oxygen and telemetry. Apparently an off duty cop wandered by and saw me knocked out in the front seat of my car in this parking lot and was unable to rouse me. 

&#x200B;

At this point the ambulance hasn't gone anywhere, we're still in the parking lot while they continue to monitor my vitals and ask me what I took. I kept insisting I hadn't taken anything but my prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and that I was just really sleep deprived. They obviously didn't believe me since they explained it took two narcan shots to bring me around. At that point I was pretty mentally with it but freaking the fuck out about my car which contained paraphernalia and a bunch of dope. I've never gone to jail in my life and I work in an industry where a drug arrest could end my career (healthcare) so now my overdose had turned into a full on panic attack thinking I was legally fucked and my heart rate and breathing were going through the roof. I began insisting I wanted to leave without further treatment and was declining transport/further services. I had to repeat I wanted to leave against medical advice probably 6-7 times because they kept insisting my vitals were too fucked for me to not go to the hospital. I pointed out I was alert and oriented, non-altered with a normal mental status. I knew my rights and I wanted out of the ambulance now. 

&#x200B;

Finally they acquiesced and removed my IV, O2, monitoring leads, etc and had me sign a refusal. They unceremoniously  kicked me out of the back of their rig and then I saw my car. The rear window had been smashed but otherwise it looked fine and my syringe was still on the floor (in plain sight, but undisturbed). There's one problem though, I can't find my keys to get into the car anywhere and it's locked. I asked the paramedics and they said they hadn't seen my keys, it wasn't until one of the local gawkers standing by informed me the paramedics had given my keys to the police officer who's cruiser was on scene. Oh shit, okay I'm completely fucked. Even though I wasn't driving, I had the keys in the ignition to power the stereo and I was in the front seat. They're gonna search my car, find all my shit and slap me with multiple charges. Possession, paraphernalia, DUI, etc.   


I jump into the window and try to grab all the paraphernalia and dope I can and shove it down my underwear as discreetly as possible but I knew I probably didn't get every baggie. Meanwhile, there are gawking members of the general public and several undercovers all hanging around watching my ridiculousness unfold. One of the undercovers demanded to see what was in my hands after I exited my car window and luckily I was able to show him there was absolutely nothing and I insisted I was simply searching for my keys. 

&#x200B;

The uniformed officer in her cruiser on scene though ended up being the primary for the call which is the only thing that saved me. See, this uniformed officer was a young black female who was without a doubt the NICEST most compassionate cop I've ever encountered in my life. Once I found out she was the one with my keys, I walked over and introduced myself and she handed me my keys and told me to park in a different spot so she could pull up alongside me. There's a glimmer of hope. She's handing me the keys and letting me move the car. 

  
I move over to a set of empty spots and a few minutes later after running my license (which was totally clean), she comes up and asks me to get out of the car. She does the same and exits her radio-car and comes to stand alongside me. The first thing out of her mouth is basically ""I could have your ass in jail and your car impounded but you need to get help and that won't do anybody any good"". We then end up having a 30 minute conversation about my schooling, my future, my addiction issues, life in general. Apparently she also has some types of mental health issues as well. The entire conversation was super positive and it was literally just her trying to get me to see how much potential I had and how scoring smack was ruining my life. She actually made me cry at one point.

&#x200B;

Early on in the conversation when I still wasn't 100% sure I wasn't going to jail, she asked if I was Jewish and I said I was half (total lie, but I was desperate) and then she talked about how a Jewish family had helped her family when she was growing up poor and how much respect and admiration she had for the Jews. Her face like completely lit up when I said I was part jewish so you could tell she really loves them (I mean who doesn't love the jews?).

&#x200B;

Once all was said and done, she asked me to get some Gatorade and food and wait a little while before I drive off and if she caught me scoring in this area again she would rip my ass apart. She wasn't going to arrest me or search my car or person or even issue me a citation. She just wanted me to be okay and to get better. She even told me the undercovers who were chilling were telling her I needed to go to jail for DUI cause I was too fucked up to drive but she said that was nonsense because she had an entire conversation with me where should could tell I was completely coherent and she had seen enough addicts and junkies to know when somebody was completely fucked. 

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna say I didn't finish the rest of the dope I bought (albeit MUCH more carefully) over the next few days because I did. But that was the last time I ever bought dope and part of the reason was the compassion of a young black female cop who genuinely wanted to help people be better instead of chasing crime stats by throwing every mofo she sees in jail. I owe this woman my life. ",1534956107.0

To the point: for over a year now, I've been toying with the idea of doing a piece of writing about the drug addicts in my city. My original idea which I've scrapped was a history of my city from the perspective of the alcoholics and drug addicts. That had an interesting angle to make it stand out from other similar articles in it's field. I don't think I could find the motivation now to research our past and corroborate it with the stories of the users though.  
  
So anyway, yeah. There are a small group of junkies that I really get along with, one of whom I've known since before I did dope and the others I've had a fairly close friendship with for a year or more. And I want to tell the stories of these people. Not just them though; we have hundreds of junkies around here, male and female, young and old.  
But unlike you guys in America, barely any of our addicts are well-presented, normal-looking working people to be honest. I know of maybe three of four who have jobs, and maybe two, and myself besides, who you wouldn't know was a heroin addict just by looking.  
They are mostly down-and-outs. I've seen two girls who I thought were Mmmm yummy-looking, funnily enough both since Sunday lol, and one of those actually asked for my number when I met her scoring off the same bloke two nights ago, and she invited me for coffee Monday morning but I didn't go and told her when I get money we'll go, on me. I don't like going anywhere with girls when I'm broke. 

 Butt damn! she keeps blowing up my phone, texting me a helluva lot she's so eager to meet. Maybe she wants drugs? she says it's not that lol but I'm sure it's not just my decent looks she wants haha. I actually know her boyfriend, who she informed me is in prison right now- conspiracy to supply? I think. Second customer of their first line was a copper haha.).  
If I hadn't lost my flat months back she would probably move in with me right now as that's the general idea of what she said the night I met her. All a longer story.  
Me and my ex are not actually together at the moment but we are having a daughter in December, and even if we weren't I know it would hurt her if I slept with someone else. Although, she gets over things pretty rapidly at the worst of times, hmmm. 

  
 Anyway I've gone fully off-track here, sorry guys (any advice lol)...
So yeah, I want to write an article focusing on the drug addicts of my city, but I feel like it should have some kind of angle to make it more interesting and readable, know what I mean? Like the first idea I had, that had the angle of being a local history following the lives of it's addicted inhabitants.  
I can't think of anything I could use to give this piece a unique selling point so I'm hoping you guys, the ones closest to me and my point-of-view, could give me your advice and opinions.  
  
Tl;dr: Read just the first and last paragraphs. I want to write about the junkies in my city. Can anyone help suggest a unique, interesting angle to make it stand out?

Their are to many thing's going on to just keep acting like I can keep acting the way I am and not expect thing's to go south. Met a lot of cool,sick,fucked up,innocent, and not so innocent people but it's time I started acting like I give a fuck about myself and the people around me. Which I sincerely do but I can't have my cake and eat it too. Might stop for a year or two till thing's level out or I might just not come back at all. Time for me to find something productive I can obsess  over that I actually enjoy currently thinking of a few things. I'll still lurk and post but I can't keep doing this to myself and to the people around me. If anything it's the best move, everyone I know is gone or I've lost contact with so that won't be a problem. It's finding an outlet for these urges that is gonna be the trick. But I'm not worried I know I can do this and for the first time I actually want this rather than be forced into it. Kind of excited to see what I can do now that I wanna get serious about starting to create a better version of myself. At least I got some good memories out of this crazy road I've been on.

Let me tell you why you may never be able to stop unless I tell u why,"If you had an amazing life let's say when you were clean for all your life and then you took opiates the first time let's say you took some percs or hydrocodone because I doubt a lot of people here went direct to Injecting, smoking, or  snorting..

First of all. When your an opiate virgin you will feel a come up taking it  orally but that feeling to you will feel like a rush. You will feel amazing but because your an opiate virgin, and you have amazing  friends, a place you love to live, a car you love, And a job.... The hydrocodone really is providing 10-20% of the high and the rest is your own brain being grateful about your own happiness in life and seeing and realizing very strongly how amazing your life is. Some people are like this others don't actually have the skills to understand why the drug is making them feel so good so they assume it's because it's just the drug itself providing 100% of the effects your feeling. 

But I promise you.... It's really just because it attaches to your opiate receptors and this activation makes you feel very good about the life you already have. If it's a good and happy and positive life, the high will be very strong.

But when you keep doing it let's say daily, first, tolerance goes up because 10mg now is no longer going to provide you the same effects first because the receptors it attached to broke off (not all but receptors lessen in the brain and become less sensitive), another reason is if you still take it to get that feeling you felt the first time, it's never going to happen, because you cannot just appreciate and be grateful for same things everyday. You think you can just stop living life and think you can take opiate daily and appreciate and love life based on what you have and felt a month ago the first time and since then you haven't even thought of doing or changing or improving ans bettering your life in anyway because you can do opiates and feel good....

No it don't work like that. Same thing with eating the most delicious food you've ever ate the  first time or listening to your most amazing song you ever heard first Time and then thinking  you can just eat th same food and listen to the same song every day because it felt so good when you first heard it so who needs something new... And the brain is very good at tricking you into believing that if this is the  best food you've ate in your life and let's say your 23 years old and this song out of tens of thousands of song you heard is the  best one, what are the chances you'll ever eat or listen to any better? So let m just eat and listen to the same thing and hope that this time if I eat a lot more or listen to the song in repeat and try real hard to feel and remember what I felt doing these activities the first time I tried it last month then for sure I can feel the same good feels again from the first time..


But our brains cannot enjoy th same things over and over... Because the receptors in our brain the felt those feelings already broke off and the new receptors arent the same and furthermore they're already coded not to be sensitive to th same exact feeling because if they did alwwys feels the same thing over and over humanity would literally die off. No one would want to do shit because they feel th same amazing high every day.

The  whole point and reason people keep doing it is to feel that same high they felt the first tim  whereas now they only feel a rush and feel good doing it because they know they will avoid the sickness and the body and brain having withdrawals like crazy mostly because its trying to adjust back into reality and the longer you've been addicted the harder th transition will be  because a 10 year heroin addict has essentially been inactive in life for 10 years. And the longer you go the more likely you will never feel the same high again. And opiates by their own don't really feel that good when you feel the physical aspect of it once you've done it so long that when you do even th fatest shot you only feel a physicql rush but have no actual joy in terms of thinkinf life is so good because you've done nothing at all for years have had no new experiences other than probably losing everything you had desperately trying to score another hit. You're life is no longer planning and living your life for a better goal or dream but just thinking day to day only...wake up, get more drugs, so long as I did that and maybe spent an hour two scoring then coming home and shooting I accomplished something today and I'm good and don't have to worry or think about anything because no addict can think about future goals or dreqms because as soon as they do not they realize there's no place fo any drug addiction in life when you Tryibg to become something unless they're thinking about becoming a dealer who uses his stash too.

And of course I'm sure the addicts including myself although I've stopped for a whlle do the drug and hope subconsciously since they forgot long ago why they kept wanting to get more in the first place (to feel the same magical high) and can't stop it because they always think today if I do it I may feel that high and when they don't plus they get sick when they don't do it they can't stop the cycle and really the only effect that is close to what they felt way back when they first try it is just feeling content you have the drug and did it and have it in your system so everything must be good. That's the onky aspect however abstract it is that remains even in a 10 year heroin Injectjng addict to the very first time they did an opiate. Why the drug felt so good th first time that part is gone and forgotten buried in the subconscious and only the abstract emotion of the contentment it brought is weakly there when a 10 year heroin addict shoots up in the morning or day or night ",1534899702.0

Chapter 3
Taste Profile

During my time working on the original OxyContin project, one of my most brilliant contributions was truly a sublime stroke of absolute genius. 

‚Äã‚ÄãI was, that is to say, we all were completely aware that the market would eventually discover that defeating the time release coating, crushing the contents, and insufflating (sniffing in laymen‚Äôs terms) would produce a high unlike anything the world had ever seen. Even the most hardcore heroin addict would be in awe of OxyContin‚Äôs euphoric flood and endless ‚Äúlegs‚Äù. Opiate naive individuals and opiate-tolerant addicts alike would bow to the clean, long lasting, serotonin tsunami that OxyContin would produce. With this foreknowledge, it occurred to me as I was letting an ibuprofen tablet dissolve under my tongue one evening in the lab when I sensed a vicious headache threatening to disrupt my work, that ibuprofen was sweet. The manufacturer had added a sweetener to the formulation. Not because sucrose would aid the action of the ibuprofen. No, they made the tablet taste sweet because they knew people like me would dissolve the medication under their tongue and find the taste pleasant. These chemicals do not taste pleasant on their own. In fact, they mostly taste so bad that we would do anything to avoid tasting them completely, if we had to do so. Anytime a pharmaceutical compound has a taste, especially one that is pleasing to the palette, it is by design. 

‚Äã‚ÄãWith that, I designed what eventually became OxyContin‚Äôs ‚Äútaste profile‚Äù. Ask anyone who ever chewed an OxyContin pill, or crushed and insufflated one, and they will all tell you the same thing: it had a unique and pleasurable flavor, even when dripping down the back of ones throat from the sinus cavities it had been forcefully inhaled into. 

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãThat was me.
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãOne may wonder: ‚ÄúWhy would a time released medication, a tablet designed not to have a taste at all, need a taste profile?‚Äù This is a fair question. The time release coating had no flavor profile, it was by design taste-negative. Only after defeating the time release coating and either chewing or insufflating the the powder inside the tablet, would one know the sweet nondescript flavor that is OxyContin. 
‚Äã‚ÄãOne may further wonder ‚ÄúWhy would the drug manufacturer put any thought into the taste of the compound when the only way to experience said taste was by defeating the time-release coating, an act the manufacturer would never condone, an act the manufacturer indeed would warn against performing?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã

‚Äã‚ÄãLet the record show this much: we always knew what people would eventually discover about our product; the ways it could be used and the ways it would be used. We considered all possibilities, we always do. We leave no possibility unaddressed, no stone unturned. This is our art and our craft; we are the gods of the world Huxley imagined: better living through chemistry.

‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãMaybe, if I‚Äôm feeling generous before I reach the end of this dispatch, I‚Äôll share the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù for the OxyContin flavor profile and those of you with a desire to do so can ‚Äútaste‚Äù the flavor of a lost generation. We will see how charitable I am feeling when I reach the end.",1534876854.0

'Look, honey, you can do whatever you want. Ultimately it's your choice. You don't have to and can't possibly justify it to me.""


""It's always been my choice.""


""And it will be again tomorrow. Remember that. So why even call?""


""Cause I... need you to know I love you. In case I don't get another choice tomorrow... Tell my family I said ""Good evening,"" anything else would just be too awkward fr them.""


""Oh fuck you. Love you too. Be safe. Please? Come back.""


My head is a swimming pool of kitty litter stuck on stupid. The xanax-gravity glob of impulsive randomness has long since settled in. I need this. It's me. Always was.. I was a a liar trying to run. She's cominh home. No. *I'm* going home. Yep.


I mix up what I'm guessing is a few points of crystal in my spoon with almost enough water. i can feel the anticipation buzzing up my legs., into my knees. Suddenly I'm bouncing my leg as I try and pull thick toxic goo into my rig. Naturally, it doesn't work at all, but it keeps my mind busy as I try not to think too hard and jinx my homecoming tonight.


**Over two but less than six hours later** 


My cupboards are bare, the fridge is halfway there. My neighbors will be lighting incense in the morning, because I won't even remember buying or smoking enough weed to last me two months. I'm fixing to go buy some beer from a long closed liquor store when my text comes through. 


""I'm here. So you actually wanna hook up or just another straight white dude invading my space for drugs?"" 


""Ha. fair question. I'm not gay though, or straight. I'm a hedonist. You'll see what I mean. But - even if I was straight I'd still blow ya if you really found that for me.""


""Yeah, my boyfriend says it's good. I'm on my way in. Never met a real live hedonist before. I have so many questions."" 


A short, petite native guy comes around the corner and stops dead in his tracks and turns to looks at me. 


""Not saying I'm nice, cause I took a few xanax. But I'm not dangerous.. Your call though.""


He smiles and walks up the steps, and next thing I know we're inside my living room.


""Be careful with this shit, okay man? It's not safe these days. I don't even know the fuck why you want it if you don't do it anymore.""


""I'm dumb as fuck. What's to argue?""


""You white boys are dumb as fuck sometimes. Why you guys love heroin so much?""


""Why you native kids like firewater?"" 


'Ha, fuck you man. That shit's your fault."" 


""Only directly. So that's a 30? huh? You weigh it?"" 


""No, but he owes me 30 bucks and he pissed me off so it's yours for 30. I don't have any more but that's worth at least 30.""


""Well that's more like $300. No joke. So he's gonna be pissed.""


""Shit, take it man. I still want that blowjob though."" 


""Ha, if it's real we'll talk about what this costs. You even old enough fo a blow job? You got any ID? I'm not even sure yo'u're 18. Creeps me out to be honest. Some fucked up kinda sting you goy going on here.""


""I'm 24 dick, I can prove it. And I think most cops would have beat the shit out of you by now.""


I mix my shot up in silence, he watches me and asks me where I get my rigs. It turns out, he's pretty familiar with my ritual himself. I give him a little dust to mix up with his next shot of clear, and by the time we're tied off and ready he's learned I'm a chef at a restaraunt downtown and he just graduated business school in the spring and is kinda.. living about as hard as a seasoned drug addict on a xanax driven two year clean celebration bender.


After our respective shots I wake up to him slapping my cheeks.


""White boy, i'm callin' 911. and takin your wallet if you pass out again.""


""Fuck off if you're gonna try to be my girlfriend. I don't need the drama take the wallet and go. Better leave the fuckin' smack though or run far, far away.""


A bright idea pops into my head, and without even opening his eyes it only takes a minute before I have his hard cock sliding down the back of my throat. I want him to feel as great as I do. He probably never should and hope he never truly will, though. This is scratching that itch of longing after pretending it wasn't real for years. Like a dog with fleas that itch is scratched, and I fade in and out of consciousness as I do my best to show him how carnally grateful I am for being such a cute delivery boy capable of keeping up with my bullshit.


A few hours later I wake up on my couch, and he's laying beside me in a light snuggle. I put my arm around him and pull him closer to me and thank him fo
r the bliss. 


""Your're really good at sucking cock, white boy."" 


""Don't call me that, native kid. And I'm good at it cause i like doing it. Especially when I get drugs for it.""


""Ha! So you're a prostitute now?"" 


""Sure. why not? You pay pretty well. You know your boyfriend is waking up about 250 dollars light tomorrow right? I'll give you cash to give him, and I promise he'll still be pissed.""


""No fuck him. He's a dick. It's really hard to find that stuff these days. I don't need to make it easier for him""


""Ha, ok man, just let me know when he flips shit, ok? I don't like being this guy. But it's really, really fucking good. So he's not getting it back.""


""I don't care he's a dick shut up and suck my dick again white boy. Ha!"" 


""Pay up anytime. native kid. You're a bottle of silver wolf away from gettin rolled before a night in jail. Remember that.""


""Oh fuck you white boy. Wanna see me drunk?""



""Maybe some day. On a date. Before a blowjob, like regular people.""


""Ha. Shit. Are you serious? Thought you'd just be my ""Sugar daddy"" 


""That daddy shit's creepy. And you're already past your prime for that. Gotta pull your own weight in  those bags under your eyes. Or marry rich."" 


""I don't think fags should get married. We're all fucking insane.""


""The world is really. You're not special. That's the point. And don't say that word."" 


""It's our word. I can use it.""


""It's not my word. It's a word I heard a few times while getting my ass kicked.. until I learned to fight. And I'm not even gay. So, at least in my house, just a lil respect please? I grew up in a different time. I got harassed for having a gay friend. Before I was even a full fledged faggot..""


""Okay, I get it. That's like some middle school shit anyway, get over it""


""It was after graduating high school man. But, it drove me out of here into the civilized world. Though I see it's been tamed quite a bit back here now, too."" 


""Not on the reservation. I'm like.. not a man? Like, less than a man. And always will be.""


""You get your dick sucked whenever you want by a white dude. What's manlier than two men with dicks?"" I tell him as I unzip his pants again.


Now it's about 8 or 9AM Sunday morning, and the light is coming through the windows and I'm sitting naked and clean on a towel I laid on the couch trying to text a number but I keep thinking the words ""Two years>..."" and fading out a little more... I hear my phone drop.


""Wake up. You can't die high on Sunday morning, you're supposed to be in church. ""


""Fuck your god kid."" 


""He's not my god. He's yours.""


""Sure as shit isn't mine, You're the one spreading the gospel here. Go to church. I'm gonna get high and die and everything stops forever. I'll know peace, you'll know false hope. Luck.""


""Jesus fuck dude. Quit being so god damn melodramatic. Can I get a little more smack? Let's put down on speedballs."" 


""Goofballs. Speed balls are coke. No one know why but t's final. And I'm out of brown."" 


""YOU DID IT ALL?""


""Want your money yet?"" 


""Dude I thought it was really good, and way more than I thought..>""


""It was. Doesn't make it last much longer."" 


""How the fuck are you not dead.. are you trying to kill yourself?""


""Specifically now? No. I wanted to enjoy the smack. And I did. I'll probably go out in a car wreck. Or ground up alive n a meat grinder during an elementary school field trip to see how laws and sausages are made. Except nobody gives a fuck about where their food comes from anymore. Don't let me get into the legislative branch kid. I don't even give.....""

 
I open my eyes, and he's standing at the end of the couch with his coat and shoes on, and my wallet in his hand smiling at me. He tosses it onto my chest and sits on the arm.


""I can't even rob you man. You're fucking pathetic from wallowing in pseudo-intellectual self pity all day. Aren't you going to count your money?"" 


""I don't fucking care. I've been working about every waking hour this summer at my first head chef gig. All I have is money, and I don't fucking care about money anymore, It's the real killer anyway. It's only ever made me miserable one way or another. I live a very simple life to account for my hatred of money. You need some money? My house is a socialist paradise, really. We welcome business majors. Go ahead and enjoy the spoils of Marx.


""Well you can give it to me if you h so much Or you could buy more panties to keep around for all those badass bitches you must have over all the time. Are you trans?""


""Thought you liked my blowjobs? And you're gay, so I must be a man.""


Next thing I know he's got both of his frail little arms wrapped around one of my arms as he tries to hold me up and steer me forward and I instinctively follow.


""What are we trackin? Shit are we on the trail of tears?"" 


""I really thought you actually knew where we were going. Fuck you, too. You're two blocks from your house.. You drug me 
here. I'm bout ready to leave your racist ass in the gutter so you can hate yourself even more.""


""Oh! Jack. Fuck yeah kid, let's go get some weed. And a cup of coffee. And share some of this smack with him.""


""You did it all. See the puke down your shirt? Are we visiting him at the church? Cause that congregation might have to deal with this shit so I hope he's in it""


""He lives in that grey house across the street. Fuck them, those Pentecostal heretics will get theirs in hell. Hey, that's him on the steps with his head in his hands. Think he's waiting for us. And I can't be racist because my grandpa was half native, which makes me only part white. Now who's racist?"" 


**Some later point inside Jack's**


""So you're gay now?""


""Nope, sorry."" 


""Oh right, gay guys have more sense than to show up at mt my house covered in puke and waving to decent society attending church accross the street. But I suppose they might have called them all heretics. What the fuck are you on and why the fuck are you doing this to me?""


""I'm gay? At least, for smack. Like any decent person!""


""You got smack? Seriously? holy fuck""


""""No he did it all cause it was to much and really good it seems.""


""Wait... is he really a prostitute""


""Haha he's your friend, I just met him. He's fuckin crazy.""


""Yeah, I've never seen him get anything like this. He barely even smokes weed.""


More coming, this story's just getting started.  If you don't iike the gay shit you oughta try it next time you do xanax and black out because it's in your sub conscience now. Only way to get it out is to go read some Burroughs and sexually harass women in a bar.

(Snowball) Have you ever...?,"Hi guys, so this just happened: I, being fairly new to them, had just done one almighty knee-trembler of a snowball for myself (do you call them snowballs or speedballs in America?) and a friend who has been a user for nearly 20 years with nary a vein remaining on her body was trying to bang her own.¬†
  
I saw her struggling and knew it must be congealed now so even if she got a vein, the elixir wouldn't pass through the eye of the needle. Crack tends to resolidify after standing around for a while, and actually I had no idea about that until a few nights ago.¬†Which is kind of strange since on one particular day preceding that night, I fixed up four separate rig-fulls of delicious, frightening snowball and had no issues with them getting hard while they waited to be picked next to enter my circulatory system. *(What's up with that?!)* 

  
So, back to the present day: I tried various methods of heating the liquid up to simply just get it out of the pin, but to no avail, so with a heavy heart, we threw it in the bin. She's not dependant luckily as she's on subs, otherwise¬†we'd still be fighting to make it IV-ready probably.¬†It was the last of our gear though so party's over for the night! ¬†
  
I did a few Google searches on the subject, finding only 2 relevant questions asked on Quora where the OP was questioning the safety and feasibility of banging a 2-week old coagulated shot of meth!  
One person, amongst his likely meth-fuelled words, came teasingly close to answering what I want to know: he said if you don't know how to get that thickened blood out of a syringe, you should reconsider your ability to IV and stick to other ROA's.¬†
  
So yeah, how the heck could I have gotten that shit out of there? My plan was then to heat it until it thinned enough to draw back up to have another attempt. ¬†
  
I wanna hear the stories you guys have regarding times your shots thickened until you couldn't use 'em, and what you've done or seen others do to salvage that precious medicine. ¬†
  
Thanks guys. ¬†
  
Stay safe and may you all be blessed with good dope or an easy, comfortable sobriety",1534864735.0
993ssc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/993ssc/just_discovered_my_mother_has_been_steeling_my/,29,https://redd.it/993ssc,Myfamikysucksass,Just discovered my mother has been steeling my dad's pain meds,"So this is a throwaway because of obvious reasons. If you look in the post history of this account you'll see a detailed post about what's been happening in my family lately, but this post is about something different. My dad has had a bad back, been in severe pain, and been taking (a lot of) pain medication for about 7 years. He always hated the way opiates make him feel, so he usually takes less than he's prescribed, meaning he has extra. About 8 months he started having the issue of being low in his meds, sometimes even out, at the end of some months. Occasionally he would give someone in the family one for various things, but it was never anywhere near enough for him to have this problem. 

Me, being the 21 year old kid the finger was always pointed directly at me. He's occasionally given me his medication for a condition I have, but the second he started having these problems I stopped accepting them from him. My brother has been given them on occasion and complained about the way they make him feel. My mom asks my dad for them pretty frequently, for headaches, when she's sore, when she falls down (which happens pretty frequently), basically she's been asking my dad for his pills at least once a week for a few years now. 

Eventually I moved out (fairly recently), but still visited my parents pretty often, and because the pills still went missing, that finger was still pointed at me. I use some recreational drugs, occasionally even opiates, but my dad has been my best friend my whole life, I can't even bring myself to accept his meds when they're offered to me for my pain because I know it'll throw off his entire life by one dose, let alone steal them and force him to be in incredible pain. Yet, my dad still slightly suspected me, and my mom was sure she knew it was me. Arguments would ensue and she would yell at me, accusing of taking them. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. I'm not gonna go into too much detail as this is a very sensitive topic and I made a post in /r/dysfunctionalfamilies that goes into great detail about these events. My father tried to commit suicide. The only reason he didn't succeed is because my mom called my fiance and I to check on him, we managed to make it there in time to stop him from taking any more pills and call 911. Before the police/EMTs arrived he kept talking about my mom cheating on him. We thought it was just due to the large amount of meds he had just took, but we later discovered he was right. 

She had been cheating for awhile. Last night my dad texted me to tell me my mother told him that she wished he had succeeded and was dead so she could claim his life insurance policy. Immediately my fiance and I grabbed everything we'd need for a potential overnight stay (medications, phone charger, clothes, etc) hurried down there, a drive that usually takes 30 minutes took me more like 13. After a long talk with both parents (not important to this story, again details in other post) we decided to just try to sit with my dad and help him relax (mom had to sleep for worktn the next day). At one point I took one of my medications out of my bag to take it but I dropped it. I was sitting where my mom always sits and the bottle landed in her purse. I reached to grab it but I grabbed the wrong bottle. I realized this bottle had my dad's name on it. 

It was dated 4/2018, and it was MS Contin. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt I opened it up and looked at the pills inside, they were indeed the same 30mg morphine my dad takes....24 of them. Now I know she didn't take these all at once, this is just her stash, but that means my mom had been taking these pills from my dad since April. My fiance saw me with a pill bottle in my hand, assuming it was mine or hers, and put it in her purse. I don't really have much of a question here. I know I'm going to tell my dad, I know I'm going to confront my mom, I'm just pissed. 

I know opiates can make decent people do crazy things, but this is beyond crazy. My own mother was stealing pain meds from my dad, presumably to get high (she has previously and still does have an alcohol problem) and was constantly blaming me and screaming at me over it. I'm just having a lot of trouble handling everything. Sorry I guess this post doesn't really have a purpose.",1534863116.0

We chased the tourists away with our body odor and grease caked pores, blowing hits of weed at their kids. We badmouthed the owners for selling out and never bought more than a cup of black coffee with refills.

So, Travis came to find me, except he wasn‚Äôt really looking for me. He needed a ride for his uncle, but we both knew he didn‚Äôt have an uncle.

‚ÄúSure, I have to be back to work at Ogelvies for four.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. He‚Äôs back at Geoff‚Äôs. We have to get something out of his car.‚Äù

Minutes later my blue S 10 idled in the shade of Geoff‚Äôs gravel driveway. It was my beautiful blue truck until I forgot to put antifreeze in the radiator, then it was an immovable eyesore that the grass grew around in the front yard of Cheo‚Äôs house on Montoya. The death of that truck marked the death of my 8-month stint of sobriety. Well 8 months is what I told my parents and Cheo. It was more like 4 months, and I was smoking meth the whole time.

‚ÄúBob‚Äôs 73 years old and from Woodstock. He showed up earlier this week and flipped his car down a ravine 2 nights ago. The highway patrol said he flipped it at least six times and walked back up himself. A real miracle. He had to throw his stash and scale before he could walk back up.‚Äù I pretended not to notice that Bob was not his uncle at 73 years old. ‚ÄúWe just have to help him get something out of his car, in Questa.‚Äù

Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk. He had an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door, swinging and creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

‚ÄúF***ing imbeciles! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse s***!‚Äù Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

‚ÄúI know. I know. I talked to Geoff about it. He said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don‚Äôt believe it, though.‚Äù

Some drama I wasn‚Äôt privy to, but I found out later that his dog was missing. It was one of two times that Geoff and Christine had stolen and traded the old man‚Äôs pure bread Pekinese to Edward for coke, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his baldhead to the stained waistband of his shorts, and he sweat. His shirt was always off, and his health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

Once after Eddie moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas into a milk jug with the silver dollars. His neighbors saw us do it, but Taos is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man‚Äôs dog got eaten by coyotes, in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.

‚ÄúBob, this is Riley. Riley, this is Bob.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Indomitable Buffalo, they can‚Äôt keep me down! Buffalo Bob Cass! Pleased to meet you!‚Äù His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band, Rick Danko. He even stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn‚Äôt stand Buffalo though. He thought he was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Bob coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in can of soup, probably from the wreck. Travis looked at me horrified. Bob acted like he didn‚Äôt hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to Taos, he stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow he lost his U haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of 5th gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory opened up and summoned my imagination. They said Taos was still the wild, wild west, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up towards Colorado.

Funny how people are when they ask you for something, especially junkies. Bob wasn‚Äôt Travis‚Äô uncle. He made it sound like his car was down the street or in Ranchos worst-case scenario but not 20 miles away in a different town. There was almost no way I‚Äôd be back by four. Travis nor Bob had any clue where his car was, not a number to call, not the name of a junkyard, nothing. It may not have even been in Questa, and I bet anything that whatever they wanted out of the car wasn‚Äôt in it anyway. But that‚Äôs how it goes for a junkie in Taos.

At a gas station we pondered what to do. Bob didn‚Äôt have any ideas. Travis was busy smoking heroin in the bathroom, and there are untold junkyards in Questa. Bob and I sat in the truck and smoked cigarettes waiting for Travis.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go in and see what‚Äôs taking him?‚Äù It had been over 20 minutes, and when I walked into the gas station Travis was on an office chair behind the counter. His face was green and body doubled over. He held his gut with his hands.

Before I got back out the door an ambulance pulled up. They loaded him onto the gurney and into the back. It was a bad case of gas as far as I could tell from his diet of pure sugar and the irregular bowel movements of an opiate addict. A gloved hand grabbed a tube of lubricant and a rubber tube in the window, before they pulled away. I shook my head and walked back to the S10.

‚ÄúWell? What the hell is taking so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance came and took him. He looked like his gut was in a knot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance? Really?‚Äù The truck was 15 feet away while they loaded Travis into the back, but somehow Bob had missed it. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I guess he won‚Äôt be coming back with us then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No, he won‚Äôt. Probably what he ate gave him a stomach ache.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he have?‚Äù

‚ÄúA giant moon pie and a bunch of orange soda.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no s\*\*\*! What did he think was going to happen? Eating like that! F\*\*\*ing imbecile!‚Äù

Bob got silent and turned away as if he forgot what he said. He looked out of the passenger window, pensive and still, pondering some deep truth about life. Dark clouds gathered over the horizon, and the aura of heroin and his tiny pupils were peaceful, quiet for a moment. His long grey hair barely touched the collar of his leather coat. It was proof of the wisdom only 73 years of life can give.

The crinkle of cellophane broke the silence in the truck. He pushed it back before his dentures ripped a chunk of moon pie into his mouth. The gold handle of his cane rested on a 64-ounce fountain drink between his legs.

‚ÄúF\*\*\*ing imbeciles, I tell ya! I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in all my life. Well, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù

I started writing about Bob as soon as he moved in. My plans were for a book. The first line went,

‚ÄúThe heartache. The headache. The stink of watery, green feces sprayed on the walls and puddled on my landlord‚Äôs carpet.‚Äù The carpet was new when I moved in. Brand new, and Bob ruined it. On top of my plans for a book about Bob, I had dreams of being a poet at that time of my life. It took me years to realize that I hated poetry.

He began to detox in a bad way, the beginning of a dramatic and obscenity-laden affair of about two months. He kept a welcome mat on the floor next to his bed, and I picked it up out of curiosity one day. Underneath were at least nine cigarette burns where the cigarettes had burned from end to end on the carpet, but the mat was also completely caked with green poop. Between the toilet and his bed, the green trail proved he was not well. There was at least one spray of lime green on the wall by the door.

Bob was a self-proclaimed junkie through and through. He knew it. He told so many stories of all the dope he had done and where he did it and how good it was and who he did it with. Those days were gone though, and 73 is not so kind to a junkie.

We were all dying like him. It was only more obvious that he was on his way out. Dead men and dead women walking, we looked for life in death, because staring death in the face was the only time we felt alive. Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else. None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended that this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery. Bob needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it. I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie‚Äôs one morning. When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit. But, he sat in his bed smoking a cigarette.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked you out? Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much trouble. They said they weren‚Äôt prepared for me. Too much s***ing. Too much runny nose. Said they didn‚Äôt expect me to be s***ing all over the place like that.‚Äù

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot. It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

‚ÄúCome on, you f***ing b***!‚Äù He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder. He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.

I slept with a few different girls while I lived at that place, one named Luanne. Some people tell you they are bipolar, and others you find vacuuming your living room at 4 a.m., dancing to dubstep and smoking a bowl of weed but you know that they don‚Äôt do meth. Luanne was that kind of bipolar, and she spent the night with me sometimes. We were good friends.

I saw another girl who panhandled change in the parking lots during the days and had my mother‚Äôs name. She was beautiful in a weathered kind of way like some old momma you find at the pound, worn and scarred by the world but beautiful because of it. Bob called all my women by the same name: that f\*\*\*ing whore.

Anytime we went somewhere he would tell strangers of the abuse he suffered at my house. It was humiliating and largely untrue, but one hipster kid bought Bob‚Äôs line and sneered at me for my inhumanity. He would take Bob to his house in Tres Piedras and care for the old man as any decent human would. The guy made a big show of how altruistic (one of Bob‚Äôs favorite words) he was and what a disgrace I was. Travis and I laughed so hard that we had to put our hands on our knees to keep from falling on our faces.  
The next morning, I found them in the hipster‚Äôs Nissan in the parking lot behind Tazza. Bob sat in the passenger seat with an unlit Native 100 between his lips and acted excited to see me, too excited, like he needed something, like things weren‚Äôt working out with the hipster. ‚ÄúHey, Riley! I‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶. Are you now, Bob?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh yeah! Extremely.‚Äù He turned to the hipster in the driver‚Äôs seat. ‚ÄúHey, you, where in the f\*\*\* is my phone?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where in the f\*\*\* your phone is! It‚Äôs your phone! Why don‚Äôt you keep track of it?‚Äù I agreed with the kid. It wasn‚Äôt his responsibility, and they yelled some more before the old man came back to my place.

Bob got healthier while he lived with me, and my heroin habit grew. He put on weight and got his bodily functions under control for the most part. After two months it was time for him to leave, and he had a place rented in El Prado. I packed his stuff into the back of my truck, and for some reason he called me a, ‚ÄúF***ing piece of s***! You know that? A real piece of s\*\*\*!‚Äù

After all I did for him I had it. I had only ever touched him with care and concern. All the times he went to the hospital, I visited him. When he came back from a CT scan, I patted his head and held his hand. At night before he slept, I washed and rubbed those two petrified pieces of mahogany he called feet and lathered them with tiger balm, but now I had him by the collar and my fist cocked back behind my head and bit my lip. ‚ÄúOh what? You‚Äôre gonna hit a sick old man are you? Bet you feel real tough! Don‚Äôt you boy? You‚Äôre real tough now!‚Äù I threw his boots into the back of my truck and took him to his new place. My back tires sprayed him with muddy snow and gravel when I tore out of his driveway.

After he moved out, my manager at Ogelvie‚Äôs, Tiffany asked me about him.

‚ÄúHe said, he thought he was bothering you a little bit or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúA little bit?‚Äù We both laughed.

He had been in on a Saturday afternoon to watch his Iowa football team play Ohio. Tiffany said he kept walking around the place ‚Äúgrabbing himself.‚Äù She called me to come watch him, and in case things got crazy I could take him away.

Ogelvie‚Äôs fired me for acting goofy when I came out of the bathroom and wearing sunglasses to wash dishes and the weird film that collected in the corners of my mouth and for obnoxiously ranting at customers. A week after that I defaulted on the rent at my place. When my landlord came to see me, we talked for 30 minutes in the cold next to the shattered front window while addicts lurked around inside. He was nice about telling me I had to go, but when he left I found a loaded syringe behind my ear. The weather had already cracked the engine block in my S10.

Before I moved out Bob called me to tell me he broke his hip and that he was staying in the old folks‚Äô home by the hospital. We hadn‚Äôt talked since the day I almost punched him, so I went to visit him.

‚ÄúYah! Fell on the ice on the road up to my house coming back from the movie store.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you rent?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Some s\*\*\* flick about a hit man. Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt worth shattering my hip. That was it, though, when I fell. I couldn‚Äôt do anything, and it was getting dark. The neighbors drove around me and up to the house to watch the news! Can you believe that s\*\*\*? Drove right around me lying on the ground! I could have died!‚Äù

I smiled. It seemed hard to believe, but unbelievably bad things always happened to him. Now he graced the nursing staff of the geriatric ward with his red faced, foul mouthed, screaming accusations. More than once, they caught him rolling around in his wheel chair smoking weed in the hallways, while he pretended that the pictures on the wall were fine art. When he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted from the staff, he messed himself and rolled up to the nurse‚Äôs station and demanded that they take care of it.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead, Bob. I missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed you, too, Riley. Missed you too. How‚Äôs that piece of s\*\*\*? What‚Äôs his name? Timmy? Can‚Äôt stand that mother f\*\*\*er. When is he going to get where he can take care of himself? I mean. He‚Äôs only 38.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He was referring to my buddy who had been living at my house since before Bob came around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going to go. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go for that matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean? Are you getting thrown out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I decided to buy some coke last month while the rent money was in my pocket. You know how it goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I do. Haha. F\*\*\*ed yourself didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù He showed his dentures with a smile.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I won‚Äôt be home for a while. At least another month. You can stay there and help me out when I get back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! Thank you!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one thing, Riley.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah? What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave Tim wherever the f\*\*\* you found him in the first place. The last thing I need or want is his sorry a\*\* at my place. Lousy piece of s\*\*\*.‚Äù

I moved into his house a few days after Thad stabbed me in the face with an umbrella over a handful of Xanax that I stole from my friend‚Äôs leukemic landlord. Despite all that I had going against me in terms of reputation and appearance in town, the black scabs on my face embarrassed me, because they made me look less than sophisticated. Looking sophisticated was the least of my worries, and while Bob was in the hospital, my new friend Johnny and I tied my mattress to the hood of his car to move me and Tim and Tim‚Äôs dog into Bob‚Äôs new place.

Johnny and I used to tear through Taos in his white Lincoln Town Car with two other kids while I projectile vomited out of the passenger window. Both of those kids are dead now. One jumped from a cliff escaping imaginary and malevolent figures. The other overdosed and got left in his car at the ER one night. They found him dead in the morning.

Other times Johnny and I hung out with an older nurse who hated me until we shot cocaine together. Then she stripped down and danced and sang for me while Johnny and I laughed at her. She never noticed that I wasn‚Äôt into it, but that didn‚Äôt matter. She was into herself.

It was common to watch her mix way too much cocaine with way too much heroine in the same shot, and ten minutes later she bragged about how she only ate granola because Fruity Pebbles were so unhealthy. She told us about a house she had in Ranchos that was haunted with a patch of red paint that bled through multiple new coats over several years. Eventually she had a dream in which all the details were disclosed about a 19th century abortion involving a teenage girl and a priest in that bedroom. I tried to contact her about the story, but she‚Äôs dead too.

Bob ran Tim and his dog off as soon as he got home from the hospital and fell in a pile of his own feces soon after that. He had gotten mad at me about not giving some syringes to Johnny in an episode of dementia and yelled for help all night long after he fell. I let him sit in it until the morning, even though I couldn‚Äôt sleep for his yelling. It was how heinous I had become. He struggled to breathe for several days before we took him to the hospital, and it turned out that one of four broken ribs had punctured his lung. He snuck his IV out of the hospital when they released him, but when he pulled it out at the house his blood was black saw dust.

Sometimes I had fits of furious passion in my bedroom and banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. Then there was no point in writing. Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt even get out of bed and chose instead to watch the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Bob caused me.

I forgot that I even had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn‚Äôt make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in the KTAO parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a Taos Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lay down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house, except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Bob‚Äôs, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left him outside of Smith‚Äôs grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith‚Äôs was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Bob‚Äôs the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can‚Äôt remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it, but I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Serio was taken from me by another local drug addict, who was better than I was. He accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and everything that I touched.

‚ÄúEverything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do, is everything you want to do!‚Äù He laughed with his dentures out like he was channeling my old friend Bobo. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Buffalo Bob Cass and made crowds swoon. Every time he died and went to heaven some ‚ÄúAbe Lincoln looking m\*\*\*\*\* f\*\*\*er‚Äù sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn‚Äôt come in the back door.

Once, he woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in Woodstock told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives. These were the stories that he told.

One day he watched Yolanda, Garth the dope whisperer‚Äôs girlfriend, open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed that he was gone, but he watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Bob slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was Taos when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn‚Äôt work out for them. He sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took 300 dollars out of his account and never came back. The year‚Äôs last snow had still not melted.

When I was homeless the next summer I would end up at that desert oasis in Ranchos called Taco Bell. Inside I would stare at the walls painted purple and red to make it look less cheap and listen to the soft jazz. The dropouts working the counter understood the plight of life in Taos and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup. I pondered life and what could have been and what was not. Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town. Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over chlorinated pool at the hotel. I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late August. Back to school commercials offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils on the hotel TVs. Anxiety put knots in my stomach when they played, and I could feel it all, like I was there, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the 6th grade. Then, I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson‚Äôs parking lot looking for a fix.

The last time Bob and I spent time together was right when he got out of the hospital again, a year later. We had not talked for a long time, but I knew where he lived, and I knew he was in the hospital, so I moved in. I was renting the front room out to Johnny and his junkie girlfriend who drooled on herself and always had 4 or 5 spoons on the kitchen counter with streaks of soot and the scattered pink crumbs of pills she called fast 5s. One of her eyelids always stuck halfway shut, and she paused several seconds between every word. They didn‚Äôt look very fast, but who was I to judge.

Bob was happy to see me anyway. That was the life of a junkie, even at 75. You go to the hospital. You get out. Junkies are living in your house, and the party goes on. My girlfriend, Danielle, put the light bill in her name, because Bob owed money to the company, and he asked us to. But when he made us mad one day I threw a big box TV at his feet and busted the white powder all over his floor. Danielle and I went and turned the power off on the old man in the middle of winter to collect the deposit. It was the last time that I ever saw him, but not the last I heard.

A year later, he called me from Miami where I suppose he died. Years later in the foyer of a church, a woman asked me if I had a grandfather who passed.

‚ÄúHe wants to tell you hello.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you talk to dead people?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends are passed over.‚Äù She said, as if calling them dead was politically incorrect.

‚ÄúOh, well, I didn‚Äôt know my grandfather. I don‚Äôt know who it could be.‚Äù

She struggled to get the deceased‚Äôs name, but could not come up with it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know if he tells me his name. He says he loves you. He says you went through a lot together, and that you were in a bad way. He said he is proud of you, for doing so well. Very proud.‚Äù

She walked back over to her table, and I forgot about her. My girlfriend and I talked at our table. She said she thought contact with the dead was evil. I had my own opinions of how that worked and explained. The lady stood up suddenly and screamed,

‚ÄúBOB!!!!! He says his name is Bob!!!!!! He loves you and, he is so, so proud of you!‚Äù",1534821638.0

I didn't think I'd fall. I stick my feet in the rabbit hole but I always pull them back out... no big deal, right? For then, yes. Each day passes and just a touch more drugs are done. But I work! But I go to school! But no one knows! I'm fine, I'M FINE! Anyone asks when I'm under the weather, ""I'm fine"" I say, but I am sick inside. I'm very sick.   


It was just hydrocodone. I was a kid. A stupid fucking kid. It's no excuse. But where in D.A.R.E. did they teach us to worry about the pills the doctor gives you? My class missed that chapter in the 4th grade. But I threw it up when I got my wisdom teeth pulled, so I threw them in a drawer. A car accident at 18 and more pills.... more of the same thing I threw up before. So into the drawer they went.   


I was about to turn 21. My friends were all coming for a bonfire. We were going to have drinks and then go out in a bus. My mom was baking brownies for my friends. She asked for my help and thought I was fuckin' with her and didn't feel like helping... ""Little ungrateful bitch"", I hear as I climbed the steps because my stomach hurt so bad. Not my stomach, lower, my ovaries actually, but I didn't know that yet. I crawled down the stairs in tears an hour later, my mom apologizing and rushing me to the hospital. 

  
The doctors ran their tests, promising me pain relief ""just after one more test"". This was after 3 or 4 but whatever, they're the doctors, not me. Finally an internal ultrasound, which was basically a dildo with a camera on it, poking the SHIT out of my ovaries. I cried and cried but at least they found what they were looking for. Finally, because they found the source of the pain, a cluster of ovarian cysts, two of them being baseball sized and already rupturing cysts, I could get some relief.   


Now this is where the funniest and also worst joke of my life comes into play. My mom tells the nurse who is hooking up the morphine to my IV. ""She was supposed to celebrate her 21st tonight with friends"" she tells the nurse. The nurse looks over at me, still doing her job, ""Happy Birthday, hun"". My mom continues ""We had to call off everything, but I guess now instead of saying she had her first legal drink on her 21st, she had her first shot of morphine.""  I didn't laugh. The nurse didn't laugh. My dad chuckled a bit. I probably would have if I could have, but the pain was too much. I would have laughed too, fuck it. They monitored me overnight, when the pain stopped, they sent me home with a few scripts. ""You still have two golf ball sized cysts there... speak with your family physician, they'll get you on hormones to get to those other cysts before they rupture, but come back in a month so we can be sure they've negated in size rather than the latter.""   


My dad said he watched the whole time. My dad is inherently good. Wonderful. He had ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" on my shit hospital TV, he said he hurt, watching me literally writhe in pain, he'd never seen that before in all his years, he was 55 or so at the time. But he said he watched, he watched the morphine drip in with the water... he watched the TV but paid more attention to my movements... he watched them slow and slow as the morphine dripped in. ""How are you feeling?"" he asks halfway through the movie. ""Like shit"" I reply, ""But better, at least maybe I can sleep."" ""Try"" he said, ""try to sleep."" I drifted off and he said he watched my body lie still, finally at peace in his mind at least, and just as one of our favorite movies was about to end, in comes the nurse ""We need to send her home, and we need this room."" she tells him. ""But.... The Good the Bad and the Ugly is just about to end, can't I wait with her and finish, then we'll go?"" What a fucking guy. My dad is amazing, that is a thought I will never let go. He didn't get to finish the movie. He grabbed all my belongings and put it all in a bag, I left in hospital socks and two hospital gowns so I was covered. They wheeled me to the exit and a nurse stood with me while my dad pulled up the car. My mom had left hours prior. ""The pharmacy on x block will be open 24 hours and fill this for her"" the nurse said to my dad as he lifted me into the car.   


We get to the pharmacy, it's not my usual as my usual isn't open at 4 in the morning. My dad is inside waiting for my prescription, but I don't feel right, I open my door and lean out the car. I throw up for a few minutes, mostly dry heaves, and stay there, slumped over, head in my hands, hospital socks somehow still clean. ""Did you throw up?"" It still makes me laugh that he asked. ""No dad, it was the coyote"". He looks at me confused, because the joke doesn't make fuckin' sense... ""yeah Dad, I just threw up but I'm okay"". He closes my door gently and get's in the driver's side. He puts the script in my bag of clothes, rubs my back while encouraging I put on my seat belt again, I do so, and we get home safely.   


My mom is awake and comes to hug me, I hug her back and tell her ""I need to go lie down"" so they help me into my room comfortably and set all my stuff in the corner. I tell them I'm just going to sleep, that the pain is gone, and I just want rest.   


The pain is gone. It's GONE the next morning. I feel great. Like it didn't happen. I go to clean my things stacked into the corner of my room. I put everything away but one thing.... a script to a bunch of hydrocodone, I guess in case those other golf ball sized cysts rupture before I get on hormones or in my case, birth control. I toss them into the drawer with so many other pills, all the same. Maybe different colors and different letters, but they were all the same. I start to wonder about them. As time grows, my curiosity does too.

  
One night I had a headache, a migraine, the kind that pounds until you can't keep your eyes open but still can't sleep. I say fuck it, I try the pain medications I was so carelessly given so many times before. I'm not sure at that moment that I THOUGHT, I kind of think I just DID. I grabbed two like they were motrin and that was the beginning of the end. I caught a nod my second time taking a pill and I discovered the Wonderful World of Painkillers. But I thought it was just that.... I thought it was just a painkiller... I wasn't really sure on what they could DO or BE.  

The only thing I want now is to get off heroin. I want to get off heroin and I want to be that person that gets to tell others the DANGER of taking a pill prescribed by a doctor. DO YOUR RESEARCH I want to scream to the world. I grew up in a home without drugs. My parents didn't even know. When they finally found out I was using... they were SO confused. They were so ANGRY, and all I thought was, how can you be SO angry when you handed them to me? I'm glad opiates are a more well known term now and that more and more people know what that shit can lead to. But I wish my family and I had been that educated years ago...  


Now I move carefully each day as to not get into trouble. ""Don't get caught"" I tell myself every day. Just last week I thought I was going to jail. I had an unpaid ticket because I was in an accident, the cop said I'd get my ticket in the mail because his printer wasn't working? Whatever. I didn't seek that out. I was late for work the other day so I pushed it a bit too much and got pulled over. My fucking dumb fucking ass. Man I saw those lights behind me and as I shoved my heroin literally up my vagina, I plead with myself in my head, don't have a warrant don't have a warrant don't have a FUCKING WARRANT.   


The officer is at my window. H secured in my vagina purse, and both hand on top of the wheel. ""Stop your car and give me the keys"". I do as asked. ""Where are you going?"" I mutter ""work"", ""And from?"" ""my home on x block, officer"". ""Why were you speeding?"" I reply ""I work in 3 minutes"". He tells me ""Well, I guess you're not getting there on time today, huh?"" I can barely breathe. He says he'll be right back. I know my fate. A jail cell where the HOPEFULLY don't strip search me. And if they do? Jail eventually, most likely. Not a holding cell, JAIL. I wait forever it seems. I see the officer coming back, a ticket in his hand. I assume it means there's no warrant, and I almost cry. He steps up to my window, ""No more speeding okay? We don't want someone to get hurt.... you are shaking a bit though, sure you're alright darlin'?"" I admit it, ""no officer, I'm okay, just spooked by police in general you know?"" I force a giggle, trying to seem normal. He laughs too, and says ""Yeah, that happens, I understand. Don't take off now until you're okay."" I don't think I've ever met such a nice officer before, but then again I am a young, white female with sad eyes so I am almost guaranteed an easy ride in this world.   


This world is so fucked. I got lucky last week. I've been lucky my whole life, actually. The reality is.... I'm the luckiest of the unlucky. That's what I tell myself. I am A Functioning Addict. I am Invincible. But the truth is? Anyone can fuck with me and win. I sometimes just.... get lucky. ",1534796482.0

Anyway, I had a friend who got into heroin years ago and she'd occasionally crash on my couch. Before I knew she was using I noticed a distinct change in her body odor. It's hard to describe. Almost metallic but mixed with a very light sweet combined with musky. That still doesn't do it justice really. It's just a very heavy odor that you can almost taste. It's not BO. Not garlic or vinegary. And it wasn't for lack of showering as she'd take two a day at least when she was at my place.

I didn't think much of it until I ran into a guy yesterday who said he was an active user. And there that smell was again. Slight metal mixed with a hint of sweet and musky. EXACTLY the same as her. I also haven't seen that friend since she got clean so i don't know if that's still a thing for her and I certainly wouldn't ask her, because I feel it's just best not to bring up those days.

Is this a thing? Googling isn't turning up a whole lot and I don't hang with that sort of crowd so I only have these two anecdotal points.",1534767417.0

I checked a comparison website and it said that morphine is generally 1.5 x stronger than oxy, so the 60mg is equivalent to 40mg of oxy. 

Has anyone taken morphine sulfate and how does it compare to oxy?  Does the SR mean standard release? And for the ER pills is there anyway to make them instant? And lastly are you able to cut the SR In half, if it is not scored?

OR

Ancient alien hypothesis believers? 

( notice I used hypothesis, theories already have established evidence supporting the idea, allowing it to be considered a theory.)


These are some angry subcultures. I wonder how angry a dual subscriber would be.


If you can provide me any evidence to back up that hypothesis show me! I'd love to actually find some evidence.

Now, for general opi rage. I'm a happy drunk and happy stoner. I understand those occasional angry drunks who misunderstood a situation getting angry when there isn't a justification...
I Don't understand opi rage at all tho. 

WD rage makes sense, but who the hell is actually angry? I only ever find sad/irritated/tired addicts. Nobody's out there being an asshole in WD When you'd think detox would effect their mood the most....


So Why do you think opi rage is so prevalent? I mean shit, they have what they needed now. If I spend a day in WD miserable, why would I get high just to spend it angry? 


I know I wouldn't get addicted to a drug that makes me uncontrollably irritated when hi. I actively avoid addicts with opi rage. 

Most explanations seem to say people prevent and/or  annoy/interrupt the opi  rager from enjoying their "" zone"".  

A.k.a where they want their high to be basically.

I find that's a bullshit excuse and the rager is usually being an overreacting drama whiner. I think they're simply self involved.  Being selfish snobs who somehow believe they don't annoy anyone themselves...I'll never understand them tbh. Especially since they just get angry and ruin getting hi sessions over pointless shit. ( opi rage couples are the worst to third wheel around)

Does anyone remember reading any papers studying any involuntary anger response by a brain reaction to opiates? 

I don't feel like diving in deep without referred sources tbh. So lmk if you've seen any academic discussions on this.



I'm bored obviously so lastly,

 what are things people commonly say to them that irritate or make you shake your head?...


 My personal example: 

""hey, pat said you're a history buff! Omg me too.! Can you believe puma punku is 12k old! Or how do you think they could build the pyramids? After all, it's a mystery! Levitation?! ""

RAGE. Thankfully mine dissipates quickly.

I was hiking and I fell 70 feet off the top of a mountain. Since then i have been in increasing pain. I started experimenting wit opiates before i broke my back but got more into them afterwards to help with the pain. I did heroin a few times while still in high school, i used to order it off the darknet. 

Last year i moved to a big city for college from the suburbs and have been in even more pain since moving to the city. I dont have a car and have to walk and take public transit which is very painful. Standing for over 15 minutes begins to hurt and i need to sit down, after an hour it feels like i am going to collapse. In the last year ive been using opiates more heavily lately just heroin but only a few days a week max because it is too expensive. I really like using it and getting high but im honestly over it, i hate waking up the morning after, my girlfriend who lives with me hates it, and obviously i dont want to be a heroin addict

I started seeing an orthopedic doctor this summer for the pain and he referred me to a physical therapist.  I have been going for a month and it has helped a little bit but i am still in so much pain. I feel like my doctor is reluctant to give me a prescription because of my age but the pain is unbearable. Should i schedule another appointment with my orthopedic doctor? How can i convince him to give me a prescription? He has all my records and we did xrays and MRIs and there are physical issues with my back like how my spine is shaped.

The Inpatient Rehab I'm going to will continue to give me subs and possibly ?benzos? Idk - I'm doing this totally voluntarily, but I agreed to 30 days. Anyway, I know all about detoxing, but honestly how much detox meds is this Rehab going to give me? How would you compare vs kicking at home?

I can't remember the last time I took a Xanax, but I've been contemplating getting one today just so it'll show up in my piss tomorrow so I can claim that I have a ""big"" benzo habit in order to hopefully get more Xanax to get me thru this god damn impending opiate detox.

So, what can I expect for the next 30 days? Any advice?

I ended up having necrotic pancreatitis, and a spleenic vein thrombosis. Needless to say its VERY painful, and opiates are the only option. So it started with 1ml subcu 6 times a day. I was sent home and given 1mg tabs. They kind of worked at first, but was still pretty uncomfortable. So they upped it to 1mg, and 2mg when needed for pain (usually at night or in the mornings, when im not moving around, im on diuretics as well so bladder fills up and pushes on the other fucked up organs. Needless to say even now I generally wake up every 2-3 in pain. So I kind of have a few questions:

How can I make it stretch? Basically my doctor is only open 4 days a week, so I have to think far in advance when I need more. The last two times I renewed a prescription either the doctor or pharmacy messed up and ran out. Think its 5-10 mg day is my acceptable level so I can run out in 6-12 days. So Knowing this id have to cut in half whatever I had just to function (it sucked). I dont really know much about the other delivery methods if I need/had to do that just to get some sleep.

Secondly, I wouldnt even know how to find a dealer, what its worth, etc. If I had to. Obviously this is not my #1 option, but the alternative is debilitating pain, and probably back in ER. 

Thirdly they simply dont seem to be effective anymore. Ive given what I have taken so 1ml subcu for 2 weeks, 5mg/day, for just over a week, and 8-10/day for the last two weeks. Is it possible to have a tolerance at this point? If so, how do I bring that up with my doctor? At current its always needed morning/night, but on a really good day dont need as much during the day (moving around, endorphines im guessing). On a bad day I need alot more.

I've been using a cheap Bic disposable pen that I removed the back cap and ink cartridge from as a tooter ever since I started smoking my opiates. After a while I get some gnarly resin build-up which as we all know, is pretty potent stuff. To clean it, I used to just scrape it with a paper clip to get everything out, put it on some foil, and smoke away. But I've found that putting my finger over one end and putting a few drops of boiling hot water into the other end, covering that end with my finger, and then vigorously shaking it for about 2 minutes, works a lot better to get the resin out. After that, I take a large piece of foil, dump the resin-y water onto it, and evaporate the water to leave behind the resin, which I promptly smoke. I was just wondering if y'all had any different or better methods to getting resin out and using it. Just getting tired of the water method because the whole process takes a while.
NO, I will not use foil as a tooter. Too fragile. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",1534635925.0

Thankfully I had the presence of mind to do that and stop so I could salvage the rest, then just now half an hour later I finally find a vein and get it in. The hassle is so stressful, especially when there's blood in the rig so I know I'm on a timer till it clots, but its all so worth it when you push it in on home!

I am new to Spain. I get kidney stones every few years and periods of severe migranes 2x a week that then disappear for months. Can someone familiar with Spanish pharmacies tell me what I should ask a doctor for? I need a an equivalent for Vicodin ES (migranes), and an equivalent for fast release Morphine 30 or 60 mg (kidney stones). Generic is best as trademark items are very expensive here if you have to pay cash. I can get 30mg cody / 500mg paracetamol fizzy tabs for 12cents each over the counter, but they don't do the job anymore and all that paracetamol is better avoided.

I tried asking the doc for something stronger than codiene, he flat out refused to give me opiates and instead gave me Novotil (metamizol), which is a decent painkiller, but I had a reaction which wiped out all my white blood cells and had me in the ICU for a week with huge infections and black rotting toes! This is a documented syndrome effecting persons of western European heritage for some reason, and Spain will probably join the rest of the world in banning Novotil.

I snuck subs into rehab as I got out a couple days ago and began detoxing I‚Äôm on the 3rd day of detox and it‚Äôs getting better each day especially the mindset on what lies ahead of me sober and if I‚Äôll return back to normal but for 21 days I snorted up to a whole sub throughout the day to stay off sick and that place really taught me a lot an I truly do have a desire to stop using I just really need it work it but I just want some advice on how people stayed sober for years and years I shot heroin for a couple weeks and snorted/smoked it for 2 months before I got back on subs and am so grateful to have got off that shit but I really want my life back and to turn normal again so if you read this thank you I really needed to vent and would love advice from this sub as I use to frequent a lot and saw many great people on here but some asshole too

Addicts are no more selfish than normal people. In fact, the situation sometimes demands selfishness.

For example, your acquaintance asks to share your dub, which barely has two shots and you need one for your wake up. If you share, you won't be able to get to work in the morning and so miss a day's pay and perhaps get fired.

You see, it's not like sharing half your sandwich at lunch time. In fact, addicts frequently share food, drnks, clothing and blankets even though we will go hungry or cold.

So my answer is addicts are LESS SELFISH. ",1534604030.0

Suboxone does take the edge off but it doesn't cut the pain out completely and this is most likely due to tolerance (due to taking it for OVER 10 YEARS , 8 YEARS STRAIGHT EVERYDAY)


Should i stop taking my Suboxone now, and start again later on? at a dose of 0.5mg ? (i usually take between 0.5 to 2 mg )

Let me preface by saying yes, I am an idiot. I knew subs were for heroin maintenance. I knew it was potent for those with minor opioid tolerances. I knew it was extremely addicting. I didn't care, it cured me, even if temporarily. I'm still not sure I care completely about quitting.

I developed legitimate, minor addiction after 2 weeks straight of use around Oct. Nov. 2017. I had been using sparingly since 2014-2016  obtaining the drug from my fathers medicine stash (although I would also sparingly use opis from other sources such as tram (lots, although no dependence developed), and rarely hydro and oxy). It has been a monkey on my back ever since, I've kept it secret pretty well but I am worried my sparing use will lead to me losing my job, as dealing with the WD on the sales floor of a retailer is hell on earth. 

However my question is, could I get prescribed subs for my... sub addiction? Or am I better off pulling a tall tale and saying I was using oxy/h.

About 10 months ago I tried H for the first time and didnt really think about how serious of a decision I made and honestly didnt ever think about a possible addiction in the future but before you know it I was doing the shit everyday, only ever snorted never banged.

Things got out of hand pretty quickly and I realized I had to do something so I tapered my habit down to about half a point of (china white?) a day and then last week I went to a health center around where I live and was put on Clonidine and Gabapentin to help with any withdrawal symptoms I may experience while trying to quit. 

The reason Im confused is that its been 5 days and ive only taken .1mg Clonidine and 300mg Gabapentin once or twice a day and the only physical symptom of withdrawal Ive even noticed has been insomnia. Which I already experienced here and there before ever doing opiates, and it wasnt even that bad. Ive slept atleast 4 hours a night the past 5 days or so. 

Is this normal? Since my habit began Ive had to go without H a few times not by choice and it seemed to be a lot worse. The anxiety and everything, but this time ive had almost next to no anxiety about it and pretty much zero withdrawal symptoms. Is it just the meds doing their job or what? I havent even veen taking the recommended daily dose. 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Previous to H I'd only done percs and opanas here and there so Im pretty opiate naive compared to most people with a habit. Thanks in advance!",1534551884.0

The last 8 months of using were speedballs while popping 4mg of xanax, 60mg of Addy everyday.

So back in December a bunch of bad shit started to occur. One morning i'm walking into my job and there are multiple desk so everyone kind of greets you, to my luck a loaded rig fell out of my jacket and bounced on the ground and the room was silent as my boss's eyes started to water...Everyone thought I was clean again and here I was just to hurt everyone again. I left to get high and to kill myself. At this time  I was using multiple times a day and got sepsis from multiple Staph infections and my body started to reject the H. I would register and then up or down the vein it would start to balloon under my skin and I started missing even when hitting the Jugular. I was so depressed and couldn't really get high so I was WD and decided to cut myself thinking I should just die, as I cut I noticed my blood was extremely sticky. Out of all the red flags in my life this was the only thing that got my attention. I went to the doctor and was told if I don't stop ill die.

So fast forward I stop using and it was withdrawals I didn't even know existed. I had a fever for about 80 days, extreme depression with normal WD stuff. I somehow never got out of the acute WD stage. How the fuck is that possible?? So then I go use for about 2 months and quit by using loperamide for 2 weeks then kratom a week after and then the WDs were a joke, I was a little sad for a few days and that was it.

So what I was wondering is if you do a good taper and make WDs less extreme then you won't deal with the acute or PAWS as long??

Ive been clean now over 100 days and at no time have I seriously considered getting high. I don't know how this is possible. Im usually miserable. I'm even training for a half marathon and ran 9 miles the other day. Like who the fuck am I and why do I feel normal again? ",1534536165.0

I have been IV'ing the pink liquid methadone you get from the clinics. Using a 3cc/3ml, 23g syringe, I am able to shoot half of a dose in one shot using these syringes.   


Here is where things get interesting. You know how orally, it takes methadone 1+ hour(s) to kick in? Well, via IV it kicks in instantly, with a rush and it is far more euphoric and warm than when you take it orally. It is on par, IMO, with H. It is amazing.  


Now, here is where harm reduction comes in. IV'ing anything that isn't made for IV is NOT GOOD. But upon further review, if you are being prescribed VistaPharm methadone, it is 100% safe to inject.   


Other INACTIVE ingredients in the liquid methadone solution:  
 **SORBIC ACID,**  **POTASSIUM SORBATE, POLOXAMER 188,** **GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL,**  **SUCROSE** and **WATER**   


Poloxamer 188 is related to Propylene Glycol. It is used to stabalize the solution. Propylene Glycol is actually used to make IV solutions, as is Poloxamer 188.   


So relatively safe, but as with IV'ing anything, it is not 100% safe, as there are still the risks that are associated with IV drug use. I am not sure what is in the other Methadone Oral solutions made by other companies, but if you are prescribed the VistaPharm brand, it is fairly safe to do.   


It is a lot of liquid to inject, but that rush and euphoria is something that I never expected from Methadone. ",1534520472.0

2.) the use of kratom, short term for PAWS symptoms. I don‚Äôt really have any money for it but I am not looking to get high, just trying to ease some of the PAWS symptoms. Would any recommend this after the initial withdrawal phase?

3.) what things can I do for my stomach that has been insanely fucked up? I‚Äôve got the Hershey squirts like a MOFO. I just took some loperamide but i know that first dose won‚Äôt do too much. Anything I can take OTC for stomach problems?

I had a conversation with my friend about withdrawal. When we first started using opiates, at least in my case, I went weeks of using without any bad withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, I did get withdrawal, but it took a while. Take a short break and start using again, and the withdrawal symptoms are back in DAYS. It appears that in the ""honeymoon"" stage, the brain is forming new connections and rewiring certain parts to accommodate the influx of opiates. These don't go away, thats why even after a long, long break, you will be in withdrawal with just a couple of days of using.

5-10MG of Lorazapem, + 300-600MG of lyrica, as my primary withdraw agents

Will titrate with Clonindine - which might even help with the leg pain

Bananas bananas bananas - that will be my food.

I have 10 8MG Ondanzetron for when or if the vomiting starts, plus immodium for the other end

Panadol for pain, & chewable vitamin c to help flush my system of all metabolites.

Water water water -

Hospital is 4 minutes away - should something go wrong.

If I cave, I have 32MG of Bupe tablets, & I will take them 1-2MG  absolutely ONLY if the Ativan & other combos don‚Äôt hold me at bay...& I reach for the oxy.

I know it's all good, and my brain is rewiring so the mood swings and the depression and the happiness that turns into panic are normal.

I've been to literal war, I've risked my life countless times over countless things: stupid or otherwise. Yet here is where I always feel so scared.

That's what got me the last time) but enough to be afraid you'll fuck up the few days you did manage to gather. Enough to be so afraid it's easier to just give in. Or is that just another excuse?

Because honestly I've been trying to understand myself and trying to understand my addiction and there are a thousand right answers and seemingly no wrong ones. Same goes for all the fucked up shit that goes in my head: I can't figure out why, ever, because there seem to be no wrong answers. Only right ones that come to me like epiphanies as I wipe my asshole. One day I can suddenly \*\*understand why\*\* for fuck's sake I'm as trusting as a dead cat then three months later suddenly understand \*why\* again - and both answers fit. So which is it? Does it even matter for the healing process? I have no fucking clue.

If I'm going to be called the junkie, I might as well  go back to the junk, right?  Emnrace it, even though I've quit for now.
-------

I've really thought of myself as a junkie, but I'm just coming off an opiate addiction that went from a few pills every day to a lot of mgs of oxy  every day, to snorting a few points of heroin every day.  The whole thing lasted about 2 years this time and led me to try H for the first time in 2016.  

Fast forward to 2018 and I finally follow through on a commitment I made to my husband to get off opiates, but I'm doing it for me.  I even walked away from a decent hydrocodone prescription that got me by about one week a month, even though it was over 100 pills/month.

I quit everything in July with a mild taper and kratom, as well as the usual gaberpentin, weed, benzos.  Withdrawals weren't hell to me, probably from the kratom I'm now wanting to wean off of.  I got 31 days off H and 29 days off All opiates, when last week I was presented with a rare 4 nights alone, so I slipped and had a three day run that no one knows about but me.  After one day off I used again for two days last weekend, after having to put my dog down.

Last Saturday night after my husband and kids went to bed, and just hours after watching my dog die, I must have done a big dose and nodded out all over the house, including falling down in the kitchen and hitting my head on the bathroom mirror, nodding out while brushing my teeth.  Thank God nobody woke up.

Sunday night I did another big dose before bed and projectile vomited in front of my husband.  He couldn't even tell I was high, just thought I was sick.

This Monday morning  I woke up and said that was it.  I was saving over half g for my birthday, which is this weekend.  I ended up dumping all the heroin I had left (not the first time I've done this) and took some kratom instead.  I puked my first spoonful of that, but the rest of the week has gone pretty smooth.  Until tonight when my husband found out I smoked a little pot.  He called me a junkie for smoking pot, even though I've been on H a lot of times around him and he rarely notices.  When he does I just say it's my pain and anxiety pills.  I get no credit for quitting opiates.  He's actually ok with me taking pain pills by doctor prescription.  It's just hard to get a satisfying prescription these days.

He thought I was through with pot, he says tonight, but he sends mixed signals because sometimes he realizes it helps me with anxiety and pain, and minimized my use of harder drugs.

So now I'm the junkie, although I've never tried a needle, have fairly successfully quit opiates (it's a process), and he only knows about the pills anyway.  Maybe I should carry on with my commitment to quit the poppy plant, or maybe I should just become who I really am, be the junkie and go on one more run.  

In Breaking Bad Jessie embraces being a criminal (I'm the bad guy) and in Justified Boyd Crowder embraces, and comes to terms with being the Outlaw.  Perhaps I should heed my hubby's words and just embrace being the junkie.  I do feel I have one more run in me and I might as well do it while I can still stomach the horrible kratom that keeps me going now and will help me quit when it's time.",1534483055.0

I will sometimes, when I buy a good amount of pills 50-100-120, if I know they have been hidden tucked in the sellers underwear or if like today I am told by one of my dealers that he currently just got out of the hospital for a double bad eye infection and he just touched all these pills when he counted them and they were in his possession for a little while which im sure at some point probably he touched his face/eyes and touched the pills without washing his hands.


When I do occasionally end up needing to do this, I will just lightly soak a paper towel in 90% isopropyl Alcohol and one by one lightly rub each pill with the towel then throw them into a container to dry. I get that I may be a bit over reacting and my buddy called my weird earlier but these are things I am going to literally be eating so it gives me a little peace of mind knowing they are clean & disinfected now.


Actually while I was doing this earlier I saw amazon sells a UV light phone cleaner/ disinfector which I thought would be perfect for this application, as I wouldn't have to get the pills slightly wet with alcohol even though it dries almost immediately. Then I realized that might be a bit overkill plus I don't know if it would effect the pills potency in any way.

What do you guys think am I a weirdo for wanting to protect myself from who the fuck knows what after you get some pills that might have been tucked inside a baggie in some d-boys underoos or possibly have some infectious virus on it in my case.. or am I just being a big pussy going overkill with my germaphobia ?

I also bought some Fent Test strips and Mecke Regent test just so I can make sure when I have any doubts that something I might be getting is a little off, some of these fake presses getting made today can really be hard to tell even if you have the real thing right next to it to compare to which I try to keep one of each of the most common 30s around for reference because I do buy in bulk but not reselling them its all just personal use for my monster habit which sucks and I have to get under control by the end of the summer hopefully.",1534481164.0

I just inadvertently pissed off my aquaitance(friend, in reality)/middle. He's a really cool dude and I like him but he was charging me way too much for the amount of risk he actually took, I always waited for him to be making the run anyway (unless I was sick, he earned his money those days üíØ), the girl lives in a fairly nice part of town, and I always drove his ass wherever he needed to before/after we did a run (and he took proper advantage of this) and I'd always buy him shit like water, sodi pops, cigarettes or whatever cause I don't like my friends going without, but don't get me wrong, that has no bearing on this situation cause I'd do that for whoecer, if we're friends I got you, and I know you got me if I'm in need. I can understand a middle who had to work for it (walking/ driving himself to the plug, going into a dangerous or hot part of town) charging everytime and never just doing it to be a good guy, but this guy had the best situation possible with me. I know for a fact with me coming, his runs were easier, and more likely to succeed. 

Fast forward to today; I get a call from the dude, he's not home, but he wants to go see the plug. All good, he tells me to pick him up at his friend's house so off I went down to the ghetto of the city we live in. When he walks out he is visibly high on crack; how can I tell it's crack you ask? Since we have little to none of them methamphetamines where I'm from. Well... very little anyway, i've seen pressed ICE pills, they're suspect to say the least, anyway my point is, dude is definitely smoking hard, and he is in full window watching/carpet surfing, paranoid about Alexa listening in on us mode. Shit, dude was sitting down in the car, but hitting up that crackhead shuffle. Dude was also trying to drink water, and if you know crack, you'll know how hard/ awkward it is to try and drink something, even with the thirst of a black dog in the scorching heat, drinking water on crack always goes weirdly.

Anyways, he finally decides it's time to call and get my run on the go, I wanted the one gram of cocaine, and four 4mg dilaudid, that's 150 (gram Tony Montana100, 8mg=$25) and this price is pretty good, standard in my area. So after checking his pockets, I see he's definitely missing something after he asked to use my phone, I realize he's missing his phone. At this point my junkie brain is scheming, I know I can get the number from this guy, I just need him to think he can use my phone, and that his is fine until we get back.  I convinced him, saying I didn't have time or the fuel to be going back since we are going back there after anyways. So after he uses my phone to call the plug, dude is way too high and not tech savvy enough to worry or even think about the plugs number in my shit. GOTTEM.

 So after we make the usual run, which in his state, took 25 minutes of talking (probably about some bs that only he cares about his car, his phone, whatever his crack riddled brain is settlling on!) I bet the plug was ready to kill herself for real. We go back to his place to do a shot. I do up a nice speedball, decided to try 8mg dilaudid + 2 pointsish of blow, by the way the girl is easily 8/10, it completely dissolves without even mixing, tastes like pure diesel and rings your fucking bell like crazy! (As you can likely tell from my post here, but frankly fuck it, you guys understand lol im gonna put a video in the comments of this shit dissolving like sugar) I even hit a vein first poke! Fuck yeah, i'm feeling like Ice Cube, today was a good day. 

Fast forward 2 days later, my main plug just  ran out of 8mg shields (the heart shaped 8mgs) and im getting ready to call my friend and go thru the bs and the extra money (it really sucks to get a good price on 8s for 3/4 of the month, then dude absolutely rapes me every single time we made a run). The run would take 5-10 minutes out of his life since the girl he went to was on disability and always wanted to make money, she only leaves home like 3 times a week for groceries, to play cards on Friday, and her daughters Sunday dinner we never had to wait or fuck around with her, probably the most professional dealer ive ever met (which is going to turn out great at the end of this story for me lol) she always gave him something to drink and tried to get him to eat, she was basically drug dealing grandma, not to mention this lady is always awake early, and will stay up late if you ask her to be ready, she will. She gets a large script for her hips, and this is her money she's hoarding away for her daughter and husband, this lady is a legitimate saint. 

Everytime he would charge me 20 bones, and a point of blow. So 30 bucks every.single.time I went on a run, and basically it was me driving him to the spot, for free and then giving him money and shit cause he knew the right person, which I never objected to, she had amazing blow and always had pills, so it was worth the little bit of extra money, but my ""friend"" never gave me a break, even on days that he got more than I did, on principle he ""had to charge me, his time is valuable""

So im scheming, deciding what im going to do for a plug since my main is out for the remainder of the month, than I remember about the number. I thought hard about it for at least a half hour, I like my friend, hell I even enjoy the drama and excitement that goes along with the run, it's part of the reason I like this drug and the game so much, it's always an adventure. But the money was killing me, I'm working hard, OT every day in the heat, planning  and working toward moving on up to a better apartment and some upgrades to my car and bike. So I decided to send her a text, she knew who I was instantly, my friend clearly calls on my phone, and they must chat about me during the deal. I straight up told her the truth, that I was a good customer, and that I loved the way she did business, but that I couldn't continue with it, purely monetary. She understands and tells me to come thru, I bring the usual 150, fully prepared to pay it but turns out it was only 125, my friend was adding 25 bucks into the coke, AND charging me 20 and a point. So at this point I don't even feel bad, I just love that this worked out. 

Today I get the text ive been waiting for, the dealing grandma, saint of the dope game, had finally informed my friend how she thought I was a lovely guy, and thanked him for the business by giving him a half, and an 8, 75 dollar business getting bonus! But dude is pissed at me, actually he says his ""feelings are hurt and I trusted you"", he says he enjoyed the runs and having me to hang out with, and he would have brought me in with him, so basically he would have got her to lie for him about prices, all while giving me the illusion that he isn't dry fucking my little virgin b-hole, and that it has nothing to do with the money üôÑ. So anyway now im at a crossroads, I don't necessarily want to lose this friend, he's a good guy, but I just couldn't handle the fucking anymore. 

Anyways, what would you guys do? Would you cut him out (wouldn't be the end of the world, but I don't mind the guy, and it's hard to find friends who don't steal or whatever) or would you maybe just keep calling him to do runs? But renegotiate the prices. I'm opting to buy him a full g of blow, and a few pills just to shut him up about it. Help me out here. 

TL;DR- I had a ""friend"" that made runs for me, but charged me out the ass, I picked up said friend while he was high on crack, and basically schemed the plugs number out of him, got gud with the plug and now ""friend"" is upset, says it's about hanging, I know it's about money. ",1534473482.0

I‚Äôm a 28 year old on Suboxone and Klonopin. Please read and relate. I‚Äôd like to hear your story and how you overcame it (or still stuck in it) if you can relate.,"Can anyone relate to this?  I was pretty much a good kid in high school.  I had a great childhood and I never really did anything bad in high school.  Sure I partied but so did everyone else.  Weed and alcohol junior and senior year.  I always fill my mind with the past as to why I‚Äôm like this now.  College came (community then big schools) and that‚Äôs where everything slowly but surely got worse.  My drug habits got more diverse and my alcohol use went up.  It seemed to be the only thing fun about college.  I still graduated but it didn‚Äôt mean shit to me.  Basically my life has been regret since.  Regret about why I studied what I studied.  Why wasn‚Äôt I normal ?  I had a hot girlfriend for almost 3 years, experienced love, experienced basically everything a kid would growing up. 


Fast forward to now and I‚Äôm stuck on these thoughts: was it because I always admired crazy people and the biggest parties because they excited me most?  Was it because I got caught up with the wrong people?  I mean as kid I always wanted to break the rules even if it was breaking them lightly, like going to the neighborhood you weren‚Äôt allowed to go in because it was too far  (I always use the term it‚Äôs all relative).  I would quit a lot of things.  Start them and never finish.  I did break my arm as a sophomore and got prescribed opiates to this day I don‚Äôt remember what they were but I liked the feeling and especially the morphine drip they put me on in the hospital with the button.  I loved that button

My point is does anyone who takes subs think about this as they get older and let it plague them?  Also, if there is anyone similar to me I‚Äôd like to hear your story.  I‚Äôm on subs for 10 months now with 3 or 4 1 week benders in the middle.  Don‚Äôt know why I chose this route because I feel like it‚Äôs just a bandaid not fixing the problem but it‚Äôs the route I chose.  The problem is, in rehab I couldn‚Äôt figure out the problem!  Why I got like this in the first place.  Is it because of the genetic disease like they say in rehab?  I never believed that.  Whether it‚Äôs true or not I feel like I still could have avoided it.  I was one of those people that never took it too far but far enough that it became a major problem and the one that affects me most in my everyday life.  I‚Äôm definitely an addict I know that, but I never did as much in one sitting as the people around me and never shot up, never ODED etc.  Everyone in rehab would say ‚Äúyou will if you keep using‚Äù and that would piss me off so much.  I started to think I was better than them (which I wasn‚Äôt) either way rehab was a fail.  I got 100 or so days of all opiates but the alcohol use slowly affected more and eventually I went back, broke my collarbone a month later, it got worse, I was jobless at the time so after that bender I said fuck it I threw in the towel and went on subs thinking it would be easy like it was in the past on subs.  It‚Äôs not easy !  I moved to Chicago from Jersey for a new job in June, but I‚Äôm not joyful.  I don‚Äôt feel clean either, and I don‚Äôt take my job seriously nor am I motivated.  I also watch and read a time wasting amount of opiate related things (documentaries, movies, YouTube vids, reddit).  I‚Äôm debating starting all over.  Can‚Äôt take a shit to save my life (or a piss for that matter).  I always thought this would be memory by the time I was 28 and we would look back at that time be like ‚Äúdamn we were crazy and stupid‚Äù but LOOK AT ME NOW FOLKS.

For comfort meds I have some short acting sleep meds, lots of loperamide (radiation to the gut so Iv needed it daily for weeks), a little lomotil, CBD and marinol. 

To my benefit I think my body weight is way below normal, meaning I have very little body fat (normally 120-130 currently 96 lbs which is why I was given marinol). And I take diuretics twice daily along with magnesium and potassium. I dont know if there is any logic behind it but I suspect the diuretics probably keep chemicals flushed out of my system because when I was taking the norco it really only helped for about 2 hours leaving me with four hours in between where I was pretty damn uncomfortable. Maybe I was just to tolerant but one more reason to get my bodies own natural pain controls kicked back in and stop depending on liver killing pills. 

So my question is, should I ask my oncologist for anything else to help ease me away or should I be fine at this point? Iv had a lot off health issues in the last five years or so and had to come off pain meds a few times after a couple of months but not this long or at this big of a dosage. The last few days as Iv taken less and less Iv noticed some muscle soreness, more gut irritation than usual (crampy feeling) and a little bit of tingling restless leg/arms and needing to stretch without relief.

My experience was pleasant and dreamy but nothing orgasmic. After this event I did have a period of around 1 month though, where I'd think about heroin it was kind of weird, I couldn't get it out of my head. After 1 month I completely forgot it. 

Now 6 months later I smoke H for the second time, well I was supposed to do it earlier but it was so low on my mind that I forgot it. It was pleasant like last time but a bit less actually, maybe the setting was not as good or the dope less powerful (I doubt it though since it made me throw up at the end). This time, I completely forgot the drug 2 days later. 

So, is it normal that it's less good as the first time if I wait so long or the dope was maybe less good? Anyway, fun drug I enjoy it but what a waste of time sitting on the couch all day.

I told them about my use of opiates and so I was treated with more pain pills than the usual person obviously. The first 3 days I was on 220mg+. Anyway long story short, they told me they couldn't send me home high and I had to detox in there and then a lady from the drug dependance unit came and seen me and I jumped from 220mg to nothing in 2 days, went into WD's in hospital then got put on subuxone.

I'm now on the subuxone program and am on 24mg a day, yep, 3 blue strips. I have wanted to get onto the program for a long time so maybe the accident was a blessing in disguise.

Whatever it is, coke, tar (never shot good powder dope), crystal, hell I‚Äôve even shot mdma lol, every shot seems to take about a minute to hit. I do get a rush, I think, but it‚Äôs def different from what a lot of people report. I guess I kinda like having a second to put my stuff away, rinse my rig out, put a hot compress on if needed. 

I just did a half point coke shot and went through that little routine. Then it started to hit me, after about a minute, so I laid down and wrote this. Not the best gear so .05 was a dumb small hit so I‚Äôm already back to baseline. I only have a pathetic .26 bag so I‚Äôm deciding whether to just slam the rest of the .2 (and yak a lot) or do two probably enjoyable .1 pushes. I‚Äôm one of those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a stimulant guys‚Äù who still does hardcore stim shit all the time but still tries to avoid the real rough edges of that game. I ate a hulk to calm myself down but a .2 shot still might be a little much. 

But so yeah, I‚Äôve had other addicts agree that it‚Äôs not *that* fast but I see threads on here where people talk about feeling it just seconds after pushing down. My average seems to be about a minute before I start to feel it, maybe another 30 seconds to peak. Sometimes I hop around and hyperventilate and swing my arms around but I don‚Äôt think that even does much more than just standing up and taking a few quick steps. I have a super fast metabolism too, what gives? I feel like I‚Äôm missing something.



Also, completely unrelated crack head tangent here, there was a big news story recently, like national news somehow, was posted in here, about that billionaire dude Henry Nicholas. I guess the chick with him is an aspiring Real OC Housewife so I was reading all about their past scandals and scoping her IG and shit. That kind of lifestyle is already so morbidly fascinating but shit really gets crazy when you add a bunch of hard drugs. I don‚Äôt even live far from Newport I gotta get in touch with Henry Nicholas and make him hire me as his personal assistant.

So I wrote down the way I remember it.,"  I regained consciousness with narrowed vision, feeling disoriented and short of breath. 

'Fuuuuuck,' was the first thing I thought to myself looking up at the EMTs, firemen, and policemen who were crowding my body's resting place on the floor between the coffee table and the couch. My second thought was of her, and so my eyes shot around the room wildly, between the bodies of the men and women who just saved my life as they spoke slowly and loudly telling me I'd overdosed, and inquired as to whether I knew on what. Of course I knew, but I lied and said heroin. I made eye contact with her in that moment and my heart simultaneously sank and split in two. She held our cat, bobbing her up and down as you would a newborn to get them to sleep. In this case it was more likely an instinctual reaction to trauma. Like ventilation for excess, since her drenched eyes and cheeks suggested the normal avenues were well beyond capacity. I got up slowly against the resistance of the EMTs gently trying to push me back down into sitting position, telling me I need to take it easy. ""I need to hug her."" It felt stupid that I needed to state something that was so obvious to me. I felt like a fucking caveman using those words. As I got up and walked slowly toward her with someone's hand resting on my shoulder as if to make sure I don't take a spill, and also remind me that this ordeal isn't over, her body shudders and she bursts into tears. I take her in my arms and with my left hand I squeeze her head against my chest and my right around her waist, pulling her into me. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do. I panicked and I couldn't do the narcan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,"" She cries out over and over again between gasps to breathe and helpless piercing cries that by this point made me lose my shit entirely. We both sobbing and apologizing profusely for a minute before I backed up and placed my hands on her cheeks in a futile attempt to wipe her tears away. In that moment I found myself meticulously savoring the shape of her face and the beautiful, glistening brown sorrow in her eyes. A sense of urgency struck me as if I'd never see her again, and a surge of panic cleared my foggy senses. I took this opportunity to calm myself, just long enough to memorize the  devastated expression on the face of the woman I love- the woman I'd just broken and lost forever in a way I didn't yet realize. My heart soaked up the guilt in these precious few seconds, where it hardened and eventually cracked, leaving me scarred and broken right along with her to this day. She finally looked me in the eyes. 

""I'm so sorry. Thank you for saving me. I don't want to die. I don't want to do this anymore. I love you. I love you."" I would have repeated the same few sentences ad nauseam if it weren't for the EMTs telling me it's time to go. I squeezed her one last time and said ""I love you.""

Reddit commentators quickly pointed out the irony that this test would just attract gays on both sides, tested and tester.

Well it strikes me that the more rules and regulations pain management clinics pile on patients, the only ones willing to submit to them or take the time and effort to study them and take it seriously are people who are hopelessly addicted or selling their script so they have a profit motive. Entire conduct guidebooks and rules you must follow, unwritten rules that depend on each location or even individual doctors, random drug tests you must do with an hours notice, pill counts, pill safes , required hours of physical therapy or alternative treatments, psychological counseling and it goes on and on. 

Actual patients in excruciating pain or end of life care or cancer patients ain't got time or brain power for all that, most of these people have trouble getting out of bed even with narcotics, and forget following byzantine rules or you're cut off. I've seen real human beings in stage four cancer on chemo or life ruining pain, these people are lucky to be functional enough to remember to carry their ATM card when they go out for fast food, and thats usually the big accomplishment of the week.

But those were just the bad times.

 I don't think I had any of those thoughts while high. Going to score dope was an amphetamine rush. Making the exchange was like crack. No shits to have while drawing up.  

There's no longing for normalcy when you're nodding so hard that you hit your head on your broken subwoofer and still not have a care in the world.

Whether you're deep in addiction or running the 12 steps, people are rarely happy.  When I'm hooked and feel like shit it seems salvation is in being clean.  When I'm clean and feel like shit it's obviously in being high.

Lyrics:

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made...
Painkillers

Count your blessings early 
Before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes 
Painkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run
What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing
Prescription made

Should I redose or wait? Is 7.5mg even a recreational dose even if I have no opiate tolerance? I don't know if you're supposed to take this stuff on a full stomach or what.

If I do redose are there faster ROA's that aren't boofing? Normally I take adderall and benzos sublingually and it works out great but I'm not sure if it applies to hydrocodone.

But i have crippling pain
Im scared shitless that i won't be treated for my pain if my MRI results do not display any new details about my injuries

I am one of those people that are in the predicament of , being trapped in the Suboxone ""Opiate Addict"" cycle

And thats not saying that i am a opiate addict, drug user, etc. i am a user of buprenorphine . it doesnt matter the reason i started using it


On the way out of the doctors office, after the doctor had prescribed me Tramadol,he told me ""i do not want to give opiates to an opiate addict""

Why am i automatically grouped in with addicts because i seek pain relief?

This has happened to me quite a few times.

Some Doctors refer me to pain clinics, some doctors blatantly state they WILL NOT TREAT ME whatsoever . (With Narcotic or Non- Narcotic medicines)

My primary doctor now thinks im a drug addict cause' i take Bupe.

The people at the hospital, when i tell them 1 or 2mg of bupe, twice a day, they think i either take 8mg-2mg twice a day (i.e. 16mg of bupe) they think i am a hardcore drug addict

Suboxone initially probably did save my life but now all it does is get me high lol -_- . 

Suboxone is 25 to 50 times as strong as morphine
Buprenorphine used to be HIGHLY sought after in Europe , in rural areas 1 suboxone tablet selling for up to $120 each and is becoming the choice drug in jail aside from heroin etc. 

you see the people that takes opiates are usually in some sort of pain,
or even recreationally most people do not get addicted ...

How can some countries have opiates OTC, and others not?

The government does what the voters want us to do and because we all ramble on about how bad opioids are, they're getting banned .


When i was younger, i had no trouble getting scripts for low-dose oxy or hydrocodone. Now  i have to suck the doctor, nurse, pharmacist & insurance companies dick  .


When Obamacare came into play the new insurance tried to force suboxone strips on me (utter garbage)

When another new insurance bullshit came around, they tried that again, and then told them if they do not cover my Amneal Buprenorphine Tablet, {they are the closest thing to the original stop - sign orange suboxones} i will no longer use them, did they approve them . 


The pharmacist who has no right to talk to my mother about my medication {i honestly dont mind but jesus christ lol}, is telling her about how Soma will make me ""floaty and high"" (i no longer get my meds there, but i came to pick up my Soma there that one time . ) 
Soma is a joke ,
Flexirl is a joke,
NSAIDs are killing me
The only thing keeping me alive right now is drinking canned pears blended with broccoli through a straw . I can't even eat pussy or suck a dick . I have constant migraines, tension headaches and other migraine, neuralgia pain

Its just become very difficult for me after the Prescription Monitoring Program came into effect

Ive been dehumanized , demoralized, improperly treated, overdosed with various medications passed the daily allotment (i.e. the allotment for a day of Diclofenac is 200mg,,, which they had me on like 800 lol... and they did NOT care that it was burning a hole in my stomach)


Because i have yet to get my MRIs due to pain my Doctor would not write me a script for physical therapy so i could get some temporary pain relief

So now i understand why pain patients turn to heroin

I personally wont be turning to heroin, i have a lot of codeine and dihydrocodeine, but i dont really want to use them . I am trying to do things properly & by the doctor but this is now ongoing 6 years straight of being treated like shit by doctors.

My new primary doctor most likely will prescribe, but what the fuck? Our entire country is just naive . 

By the way - don't believe the overdose statistics on TV. that incorporates numbers of overdose deaths that INCLUDE things like antidepressants. 


i just am fed up . i may begin to use the code/dihydro and see where i get. the codeine i feel will not last long enough. i feel it might work, but not be strong enough.

(and yes, i know all about bupe tolerance, so i would not start a new regime like that without detoxing a little bit . i usually only take 1mg anyways)

Now, when i have pain, or i think about pain, i get overwhelmed with anxiety thinking about it . Its stupid and not fair . 

If the war on drugs was ended Mexico would be more stable because the majority of their income is literally from the sales of drugs to the united states which is why the narcos act as the government . and yea, blablabla",1534389071.0

I knew it was definitely more effective than snorting the ECP I get around here, but still, my butthole has been pristine and unpenetrated for all of the years I have lived on this fine earth. But for some reason today was the perfect storm of cirumstances.

I was driving home from dropping off my girlfriend who lives about a half an hour away from where I stay. I was excited to get home because I had about half of a bundle left over at my house and nothing to do tomorrow morning. But, as a snorter, I was annoyed as my allergies had been acting up and since I can only use one of my nostrils in the first place, it was going to be annoying as fuck to get noddin' away. 

Then a voice, a mere whisper, ran through my mind. Almost like an ethereal, echoing voice of god, or at least god played by Morgan Freeman: *Use the butthole.*

My junkie senses tingled, and I remembered I had a few bucks to spare for the week after a hefty paycheck last week. I drove to my local CVS before I got home. Distracted by the holy voice still recounting the magic that I had learned from this sub could be accessed through... well... my ""holy,"" I got to the checkout counter. A pretty girl around my age asked me what I was doing tonight. Me being an awkward dumbass lost in thought about the sweet glory of pumping hard drugs into my anus like basting a turkey, I just spat out ""its for my dog"" (?), grabbed the change from her hand and left.

A quick google search and I found the guide that I read in that same voice, and fast forward to now: I have finally defiled my precious rectum and am high as FUCK as a reward for my sins.

My physical therapist told me I needed to go back to the orthopedic specialist to maybe talk about getting an injection or something because I'm in so much pain which I actually really am! Do Orthopedic Specialists ever give painkillers or is it really something people just don't do anymore?,1534380953.0

I have heard quite a few people say that pregabalin works just aswell as subutext

I was just wondering if any of you have experience in coming off of heroin with pregabalin. I have about 20 300mg tabs of pregabalin and really want to get off of heroin I was planning on doing a fast detox on these if they work like i would normally do with subutext, 8mg first day, 4mg the day after, 2mg after that and so on.

Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks

Reggie and I met one night in Matts tiny room, through Amy. Reggie was tall and skinny like me, and when I told him I was trying to buy an 8 ball of powder he offered to source it for me. I rode with him and Jimmy, a short portuguese guy with a high pitched voice, to a bar in an old train car a few miles from Matts house. Reggie went in with my cash and came back to the truck with exactly what i asked for. I put the bag on my scale on the floor of the track and weighed it; 3.5 grams. ‚ÄúSee kid? I told you, I dont fuck people. Im good people bro, you‚Äôll see‚Äù Reggie said. ‚ÄúYeah, it weighs, but I wont know what it is until we get back and I drop it in the water. I gotta see how she swims first.‚Äù I countered, and Reggie knew I was right. 
‚Äã‚ÄãWhen we got to Matts, I cooked up a half gram in a spoon, testing the quality, and it was good.
‚Äã‚ÄãI handed Reggie a fat crack rock and said ‚ÄúTell me what you think, I want your opinion‚Äù. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie loaded it into his glass stem and brought it to his lips, puffing and twisting as he licked the flame onto the crack ever so gently, like a true professional. Watching him smoke, I immediately knew he was no stranger to cocaine, maybe even more experienced than me. I had only been smoking coke for 2 years, and before that, I had only sniffed powder maybe 20 times in my life. Sniffing was cool but I never liked how much it fucked up my nostrils, or the way I would claw at the bedsheets as the sun came up, unable to sleep or get comfortable enough to relax. Smoking coke, however, was entirely different for me. The high was powerful, euphoric, even sexual, and it was short lived. I could smoke coke and eat pizza at the same time. I could fall asleep with ease after smoking, sometimes I had even slept holding the pipe in my hand. I didnt crave it when it was gone, moreover, I could actually sleep with it in my pocket, if I wanted or needed to. It took discipline, but sometimes that coke I had was my only way of earning any cash, and so smoking it was out of the question. Sure, Id think about it, wanting to get high. But I figured if I was unable to control myself, I was nothing more than a feen and a crackhead, and I didnt want to be that. So I learned to hustle, hold work, make moves, and survive. I was always going to survive. That much was certain.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie finished hitting the pipe, closed his eyes as he held it in, exhaled a giant plume of acrid smoke, opened his eyes and starred at me for a moment, unable to speak. I began to chuckle. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI know that look‚Äù I said. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúKid, holy fuck. HOLY FUCK. Yo you really just cooked this shit?!‚Äù Reggie said, in disbelief. 
‚Äã‚ÄãThere were 4 or 5 other people in Matts room, plus Amy, Matt, and EC, a point guard I played basketball with on my JV high school team. The room hushed, everyone stopping their conversations to see what Reggie was ‚ÄúHoly Fuck‚Äù-ing about. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYo this kid is a fucking GENIUS! He is a beast! Bro you gotta cook my shit for me!‚Äù he said, taking a bag out of his pocket and handing it to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãFrom that moment on, I was no longer the ‚Äúnew kid‚Äù in the homeless food chain. I was the chef, and it was not long before my name was ringing in the streets. I also was no longer homeless, technically. Reggie found out I was on the street and immediately told me I was always welcome to crash at his baby moms crib, up in the apartments on Independence Drive. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat apartments on Independence?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúI never heard of nothing up there but Shepleys and the spot where them kids burned and buried that body.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOh yeah kid! Two apartment buildings, 3 stories tall. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù he said.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie and I got close. Reggie had the gift of gab, like me. He could finesse you and get you to do what he wanted, whether you knew it or not. He liked me because I was honest and I was real, not pretending to be a hustler like so many of the kids on Cape Cod. I had been places, traveled, lived and worked elsewhere. So had he. We had a lot in common. 
‚Äã‚ÄãIn high school Reggie had been a track star. He could run like the fucking wind. He was so fast and had so much stamina, he was also famous for outrunning every cop that had tried to chase him on foot. I shit you not, one night he and I were smoking coke in a shitty hotel room up near the mall, and we decided we wanted another half gram to smoke. But neither of us had a ride to go get it, and the dealer was about 2 miles from us down Route 28. Reggie said ‚ÄúFuck it, I‚Äôll run.‚Äù And he got up, left the room, and ran to the crack man, bought the half gram, and ran back. It took him all of 25 minutes. I was impressed. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie had Jacob, his son, with Patty, their only child. Patty, Jacob, and Pattys two adult children from her previous marriage, Geoffrey and Courtney, lived in a 3 bedroom apartment in Independence Park. Literally the only apartment ‚Äúhigh-rises‚Äù on cape cod, there were two buildings at the time, each 3 stories, each floor holding like 8 apartments. All in all, probably about 50 units. The apartments were brand new, and I started living there with them full time, first on the floor in the living, then on the couch, then eventually in Geoff and Jacob‚Äôs room.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãThere were two Amys I met in Hytown. Amy my street mom was first. Later, right around the beginning of May, Reggie and I walked down past the high school to a row of condos where Amy #2 lived. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy #2 was a petite blond in her early 30s. From the outside, her condo looked really nice, and I was intrigued to see the inside and meet this girl when we walked up the driveway. Reggie opened the screen door, knocked, and then announced himself as he opened the actual door and walked into the living room. I followed behind, slowly and cautiously. Reggie was street smart, and he could fight, but sometimes he was too focused on getting high, and he moved sloppy. I was always careful, moving with more purpose, constantly on alert. I knew how things could happen. I had been in some situations that almost cost me my life, and some that almost cost me my freedom, and a few where I narrowly escaped with both. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy!!! Where you at girl!‚Äù Reggie yelled, coming back out of the kitchen and bounding up the stairs to the second floor. I just chilled in the living room, standing next to the fireplace where I could see both doors, front and back. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIm up here‚Äù I heard a muffled voice squeal, in a very valley girlish tone.
‚Äã‚ÄãEventually Reggie and Amy came down and he introduced us. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúSo, he said you wanted some dope, right?‚Äù she asked me as we sat down at her dining room table. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, he told me you had a plug for some flame - you got a tester though?‚Äù I asked.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhats a tester?‚Äù she said, looking at me puzzled. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI sighed, and said ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not buying shit until I see what it is.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy scoffed, and then stalled a few minutes, waiting to see if I would break and give up my cash without a fuss. I didnt say another word. Reggie eventually took the cue.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHe has the cash Aim, he isnt a junkie shitbox. He spends bread and he moves work, I have been with him, this kid is a hustler.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy looked at me again, stood up and went upstairs. A few minutes later she returned with a bag of brown powder. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThis what it looks like. Check it out.‚Äù she said, handing it to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI opened it up and smelled it: vinegar filled my nostrils. I kept my poker face on, but inside I was jumping up and down with excitement. This was real dope, not fentanyl cut into powdered sugar. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, it looks straight‚Äù I said. I handed her $50, and she immediately barked out ‚ÄúBut you are going to hook me up too, right!?!?‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI nodded in confirmation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never stingy.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy got her bag of brand new needles and handed one to me. Reggie piped in ‚ÄúI want one too kid.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI looked up at him in disbelief. Reggie didnt have a dope habit. He loved cocaine even more than I did, but he never really got into opiates. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBro are you serious?‚Äù I asked, confused. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAbsolutely! I do it every once in a while, just not often, so I dont catch a habit.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI scooped about a point of dope into Reggie‚Äôs spoon, and a point into Amy‚Äôs. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIs that straight‚Äù I asked Amy, and she nodded in agreement. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI scooped about double what I gave them into my spoon. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI had been sniffing pills and heroin for almost 20 years, but I hadn‚Äôt injected anything until about 3 days previous. Actually, the day Sean beat me for my $40, I shot up a suboxone strip in the bus station bathroom. That was my first injection. I had always been vehemently against using needles, but homeless and broke and dope sick, I felt like it didnt matter anymore. When you go to the hospital, does the doctor give you medicine orally because thats the best route of administration? No, they put a butterfly in your arm and inject it into your blood stream. 
‚Äã‚ÄãIts not so much the injecting of drugs that is so bad, its so much of the shit associated with injecting. Like not knowing what your doing for example, when you first start with the needle. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy looked over at my spoon and saw my cotton. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAre you serious! Hahahaha! Look at the size of this kids cotton!!!‚Äù she scoffed. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat the fuck is wrong with my cotton?‚Äù I shot back.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI mean its fucking HUGE dude!‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúDo you even know what your doing?‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie jumped in ‚ÄúHe just started a few days ago shooting. He‚Äôs still learning, Aim. Dont be a bitch.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãMy cotton was huge. I was terrified of getting a particle in my needle. Funny how those fears dissipated over time. A few months later I was shooting everything I came across; coke, crack, MDMA, amphetamine salt, morphine, hydromorphone, the list goes on.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat the fuck ever‚Äù I mumbled, drawing the dope water into my needle. ‚ÄúMind your business.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãI tied off my arm and started to do my shot. I hit first, which was funny since I was the newbie. Shortly after, Reggie asked Amy to help him. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWill you fix this for me Amy, I cant fucking do it.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúSure I got you honey‚Äù Amy said and she took his rig, pulled the dope water into it from his spoon, and flicked it, checking it in the light above the table.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúCan you hit me too?‚Äù Reggie asked. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI finished my shot as she began to do Reggie‚Äôs for him. The dope was good, really good. I was soaking in a warm bath of honey and back rubs from naked nympho angels. I lit a cigarette and watched Amy stick Reggie and plunge the entire shot into his arm. As I watched her plunge the shot, I realized how dark and brown the water was, and how much of it was in the needle. Looked to me like almost 100 cc‚Äôs, a GIANT shot for someone who only does heroin every once in a while. 
‚Äã‚ÄãShe stepped back from Reggie and sat back down in her seat, and Reggie‚Äôs eyes were closed. His head immediately tilted back and I knew that something was not right.
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy was sitting with her legs crossed in her chair,  searching her thighs for a place to inject her shot. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy where is the Narcan I asked you about?‚Äù I said, my voice tense. ‚ÄúSomething aint right. Reggie! YO! YO REG!‚Äù I yelled, standing up out of my chair.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHes fine. Relax. Chill the fuck out man.‚Äù Amy said, not even looking up from her legs. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo, hes not.‚Äù I barked, as I made my way around the table to Reggie. He was gargling and his eyes were rolled all the way back in his head. I shook him. I slapped his face. I threatened him.
‚Äã‚ÄãPanic and adrenaline arrived, and now I was getting serious. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAmy, WHERE IS THE NARCAN.‚Äù I demanded. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI dont know man, fucking chill out, I‚Äôll find it when I‚Äôm done doing my shot.‚Äù she said, still searching her thighs for a spot to do her shot. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBITCH. I will fucking take your shit and slap the fuck out of you. Get the narcan RIGHT NOW. Dont fucking test me. You dont know me.‚Äù my voice low and calm. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy threw her needle down onto the table in front of her, jumping up out of her chair. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOh my god, fine, you fucking asshole. Jesus christ, fucking newbies.‚Äù she said as she walked into the kitchen, reached on top of the fridge, and grabbed two narcan nasal spray kits. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúHere, are you happy now?‚Äù she said as she handed them to me. 
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie wasnt breathing. His lips were getting blue. He was foaming a little out of the crease of his mouth.
‚Äã‚ÄãI hadnt ever seen an overdose before. I hadnt ever used narcan either. I ripped open one of the boxes, and assembled it as quickly as I could read the directions. I put the tip in Reggie‚Äôs nostril and squeezed it down. WOOOSH, a big spritz of narcan liquid right up his left nostril. I stepped back and he coughed a bit, his head no longer laying back limp. I prepared to hit his right nostril with another spritz, but suddenly he opened his eyes and starred at me, looking dazed and confused. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúBro, you fucking OD‚Äôed‚Äù I said, and I let out a long sigh of relief.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat dude? Thats fucking crazy‚Ä¶.‚Äù he said, looking around trying to get his bearings. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúAnd this bitch was gonna let you die.‚Äù I said, pointing at Amy. She was still searching for a vein. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo I wasn‚Äôt motherfucker!‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúYou were overreacting! He was FINE! He was just nodded out!‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, nodded out and not breathing right?‚Äù I countered. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúReally kid, I wasnt breathing?‚Äù Reggie asked. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYour lips were blue.‚Äù I said, matter of factly. ‚ÄúShe just didnt want to be interrupted, she hasnt gotten her shot.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãReggie looked at Amy and shook his head in disgust.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWOW‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust‚Ä¶. WOW.‚Äù
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy never looked up, she just kept looking at her legs, searching for a vein.
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãIts fair to say Amy #2 was someone I had no respect for, for reasons I think are obvious. But her roommate was the source of the heroin, and it was fire, so I ended up going to Amy‚Äôs condo a lot. Reggie liked Amy but I didnt understand why. It wasnt for her looks. She was that type of girl who was probably really hot in high school and then got turned out on drugs in her expensive college. She would shoot cocaine and stand in her bathroom for insane periods of time, picking at her face. Some people are pickers, not just meth heads. Its a horrible ‚Äúgeek‚Äù to have, in my opinion. Her face was constantly covered in scabs and bleeding holes. As was the majority of her limbs. 
‚Äã‚ÄãI learned that Amy‚Äôs father was how she afforded the condo. He paid for everything. He would come by once a week, the same day and time , for 10-15 minutes. His visit was really just to hand Amy cash for the week. The rest of the bills he took care of without her participation. Her ‚Äúroommate‚Äù was really just her drug dealer, living in the second bedroom, for free. He would sell her the coke and dope when she had money, and when she was out, he would crumb her with just enough to keep her from going ape shit. I never actually saw his face, which was something I respected. Smart not to be seen. 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚ÄãA few weeks later, Reggie and I were out running together as usual, and we ended up at Amy‚Äôs for some reason, I cant remember why. Once we got there, we wanted to smoke crack, so I told Reggie to see if Amy could get us a $40 piece. 
‚Äã‚ÄãAmy told us that she had to order it, her roommate wasn‚Äôt home. So she made a call and we sat downstairs waiting. When dude arrived, Amy was upstairs in her bathroom, like always, and dude didnt even look in our direction as he ran up the stairs to her. Later, he ran back down the stairs and out the front door. Reggie and I looked at each other, and then we both stood up and headed upstairs to find out what had happened to our $40. We found Amy in her bathroom. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhats up?‚Äù Reggie asked her. ‚ÄúDid you get it?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, here you go.‚Äù she said, handing him a folded piece of paper. 
‚Äã‚ÄãHe opened it up and looked at the contents, and then looked at me. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶.‚Äù I asked, peering into the fold. It was about $5 worth of crack, if that. Definitely NOT $40 worth, not even $20. What was in the paper was enough for one person to smoke a half hit, basically a giant tease and not even worth doing.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNo, this is not going fly‚Äù I said to Amy. ‚ÄúNot even fucking close Amy. Give me my shit. You do not want to try this game with me, you will lose, I‚Äôm trying to tell you.‚Äù 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThats all they gave me!!! What do you want me to do?!!?‚Äù Amy yelled, slamming her tweezers onto the bathroom counter. ‚ÄúI mean I cant force him to give me more, can I?‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYou could have called us upstairs before he walked out the door Amy.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou know Im not letting this ride. You can either call him back here, or you can give me my $40 back and keep this crumb you are trying to give me. One way or another though, I‚Äôm getting whats mine.‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúI cant call him back here, he doesnt have a phone!‚Äù she screamed, and I knew then she was trying to game me. I started to pace and noticed something sitting on the hamper full of dirty clothes. It was a brand new iPhone 6, like BRAND NEW. The 6 had just come out that same week. Again, Amy‚Äôs father.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúOk well if you are gonna rob me then I guess I have no choice‚Äù I said, picking up the iPhone and showing her I had it in my hands. ‚ÄúFuck it, I bet this is worth more than $40 anyway.‚Äù I said, as I started walking out the bathroom to the stairs. ‚ÄúReg, we out.‚Äù I yelled.
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNO!!‚Äù Amy screamed, chasing behind me. ‚ÄúGIVE THAT BACK!‚Äù
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúNot until you give me my money or my work Amy, I‚Äôm not playing with you‚Äù I said. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúFINE ASSHOLE‚Ä¶. ‚Äú she said, reaching into her bra and pulling a baggie out. She handed me the baggie and I looked at it closely. ‚ÄúIts all there asshole‚Äù she hissed.
‚Äã‚ÄãI handed her the iPhone and started making my way out of the house. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúIm gonna call the cops on you, you fucking ASSHOLE!‚Äù she yelled after us. 
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúYeah, you do that you dumb bitch.‚Äù I said as I opened the screen door and walked out, Reggie behind me. 
‚Äã‚Äã
‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWhat in the actual fuck bro‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, turning to Reggie as we hustled down the driveway into the foggy night. In my backpack I had a stolen .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. In my nut sack I had a large quantity of ECP, probably around 10 grams, what we called a stick in the commonwealth.

He doesn't have a car, but has a lot of errands to run so every morning we send a text asking if he needs anything today and at any point in the day if he needs something (considering we're not already busy of course) we drive over and usually end up spending the day with him. We'll run and do whatever he needs, then we chill at his place for hours and hours, watching movies, doing lines, whatever. 

Awhile back we had a scare where he asked us to run something to his girl. He hands me a grocery bag and we run it down, but later that day he called accusing us of stealing from him. Apparently he wrapped it up a certain way and it wasn't the same when she got it. We explained we'd never do that, but told him if something is missing we may have dropped it or whatever, we'd pay for whatever was gone, but we promised we didn't steal (we didn't even open the bag). After told him that he believed us and now we're cool again. 

Today my best friend was sick as fuck and has to work tonight, I was trying to help him out but we don't get paid till tonight (technically it's tomorrow at 1-2AM but still) and he doesn't get paid til Friday. Today J called us over cause he needed us to send his ex-wife some money (he can't use WU or anything on his own because he sent some other people money so much they thought he was laundering money) and get his dry cleaning. We went and did that and after when we got back I asked if it'd be possible to get a front to help out our friend. Before I was even able to finish asking he grabbed his shit and started pulling out a .5. I started to explain that I'll pay him tonight and my friend will pay me back later right away he stopped me a said ""y'all don't need to go through all this explaining and shit. Some people gotta explain but not y'all. Do you need something for yourselves too?"" 

Only reason I'm making this post is because it's a nice feeling to be able to have a dealer like this when all I hear from friends or read on here is people getting fucked or having to bend over backwards to get their shit.

Edit: Figured I'd add some clarification because of the criticisms of our actions here

1. We *NEVER* do anything we don't want to. Multiple times we've been asked to run drugs somewhere and we say no (with no argument from J) every time because we're not comfortable having drugs in the car with us (the only time we have dope in the car is on the way home after a pick-up)

2. The Western Union isn't going to some random person for some random reason. It always goes to his Ex-wife to help her take care of his son. Also important to say that we knew her for years before we ever met him, and I had sent her money through WU at least twice before we even knew J.

3. J never carries *ANYTHING* illegal in the car. I'm not saying this just because I trust his word and he says he's clean, I *know* this for a fact. 

4. We're not being manipulated into doing anything. There are plenty of times we're unavailable or don't want to go anywhere and don't help when he needs it. He's okay with this. To us it's no different than helping your buddy run errands while his car is in the shop, just not temporary. 

5. We are compensated *very* well for what we do. To some, a G might not seem worth it, but when a G lasts you 2 or 3 days, and you're getting a G at the very least every other day, it supports your entire habit (we literally haven't paid for dope in 3 months. Not once). Also no matter how much or how little driving we do, if we drive him somewhere, we leave with a full gas tank. On top of all of that, when we're done with errands, we go to his place, do lines, watch movies, eat his food, smoke his cigarettes, etc and just hang out with him. 

6. No he isn't fucking my fiance. ",1534375013.0

I am a pain patient and normally take about 90 10/325 vicodon a month (rx'ed 120,but since on Cymbalta I've cut back a lot),   25mcg fentanyl patches,  and 120mg Cymbalta.  

I normally get rid of 30-45 of my hydrocodone a month to my guy that trades me various other stuff ie: blow,  kitties,  or Molly etc.  Sometimes because I will delay in replacing my patch in time,  I have an extra 1-2patches at end of month that I trade as well. 

Anyhow,  my brother passed away and I was really disorganized and had a box of my patches in my back seat.  I only gave ""my guy""  rides the day they vanished and knew he took em. Anyhow he never owned up to it,  but said he felt badly for me (yeah total bs but whatever too late now) he gave me about 60mg of methadone that I slowly used over like 3days which helped wd's but I was still in agony from pain. 
He has offered to get me another 200mg bottle of methadone or offered me heroine,  which I initially refused. 
Since I am in severe withdrawals now,  I am considering everything but only want enough to get me through the next two weeks until I get me new scripts.  Since in severe pain and withdrawals,  I am eating through my hydrocodone way too fast now and only have like 25 left. 
After I get my scripts I am done with him and not ever gonna get rid of my extra again.  
What would you suggest I get from him to get me through the next two weeks?

Thank you for your time posting and responding. Withdrawals are the fucking worst.

I know that they aren't opiates but I myself, and many others seem to be getting these prescribed more and more lately with their opiates. Always good to know about any interactions and such.

Which of these has less side effects or adverse affects. Which one is more dangerous in the short term, long term, etc.

I know most people prefer the effects of pregabalin over gabapentin and I myself have only tried gabapentin and think its ok recreationally. My goal is not necessarily the one that feels better but rather the one that is least toxic or damaging to my body.

I know that they both can have a ton of weird side effects and thats why I'm asking. Is one more likely to cause ulcers, or liver damage, kidney damage, heart problems, etc. I have a bunch of stomach issues so knowing which one is harder on the stomach would be helpful. Basically I want to minimize the harm I cause myself by taking one of these with my subs or alone. They really seem to help my anxiety so I'd like to stick with whichever is the least toxic. Thanks!

I then was on kratom during this time off street drugs, which is such a shitty habit, I have tapered down to less than a gram and almost am ready to say goodbye to it too. Last night I had a dream I found some old paraphenelia caked in this fire purple heroin I once copped off DNMs and I tried scraping it off to snort and it got mixed with plastic scrapings, etc, and I just have up. 

I saw my ex dealer and did not even think of copping, i see all the people on the streets i used to go to to cold cop and even when i feel down i dont want to grab. My pain issues are finally getting better slowly (i made no progress while using for a variety of reasons), and i am starting to get my brain back-- i never realized how dumb street drugs made me. I can think clearly now and feel like i, escaping the black grips of this affliction. 

Beyond all that, i still have some deep admiration for the drug. I came to hate street drugs (cut up poisoned fentanyl shit), not HEROIN, which is still such a beautiful molecule to me. I cannot say I will never use again, but I will never buy a street drug from a dealer and go into that world, if i can help it. 

The main lesson I learned is that 90% of my excess misery, my health problems, family, financial, everything, was the result of using street drugs. I am convinced if I had had access to pharma grade sterile heroin I would have been far safer, happier, healthier. This past years of my life redpilled me on so much, on society, law and order, attitudes, fairweather friends, etc. I honestly am almost thankful to have gone through it but I know that is rationalizing wasted time. 

I am glad to be free of that shit, but at the same time, I am almost giddy at thinking of how amazing the poppy flower is. Truly given to us by a compassionate God, only humans took it and mutated it into a black tentacled fuck like humans always tend to do. So when I see the 12 steppers, the NA freaks preaching their bullshit about drugs are bad mmmkay and how we are all powerless, I see that as just another fault of human concious. To me, these people view the drug in a box corrupted by societial influence and self hate.

Life has been really good as of late... my son is 14 months old, and getting bigger every day. He is so much fun and we do everything together. We just went to Ocean City, Maryland last week with the family and we had an amazing time. My family life has been great, especially with my beautiful fianc√©. My band is doing great, too. We played our first festival and had an awesome time. I been playing Fortnite lol (groundTERRAPIN on PS4) but I just cut down. I was going hard on it playing all day, every day. Now I play like a round or two a day. Lol also cut down heavily on scratch offs.

Drug wise, I still smoke bud. I been vaping oils more than smoking buds, but it‚Äôs like the same thing. I also take psychedelics or adderall occasionally, but I haven‚Äôt touched crack, coke, or meth or any other hard drugs in a long, long time. Drinking, I can take it or leave it. I have a few here and there when I‚Äôm out and it‚Äôs there. I‚Äôm down to 48mg a day with the methadone, and dropping. I been on a taper from 53mg and I‚Äôm coming down 2mg every 2 weeks as of right now. So pretty soon I‚Äôll be off that, too. Life is good.

If I can get off dope, anyone can. I was a straight heroin/crack addict and I thought I‚Äôd never stop. I thought I‚Äôd die an addict. And I almost did, thanks be to God I got a second chance. I almost didn‚Äôt take the second chance either. So glad I did. Life can be amazing if you let it. Anyone struggling, hit me up.

This is a camping festival so i was planing on locking anything valuable in the car instead of just putting it in my tent and hoping no sneaky hippies raid my tent during the music.

My friend and i have about 10 bundles of number 4 heroin to use and enjoy throughout the weekend. If we lock it in the car with 90 degree weather, naturally the car is going to bake like an oven with the windows all shut, will the dope survive? should we be worried about it clumping into useless junk or worse off?

I was thinking of putting it in an airtight mason jar to avoid humidity exposure, what do you think? Thank you for your time and consideration. Need some veteran advise on this one, please help if you can!

TLDR: would #4 heroin be safe in an airtight mason jar locked inside of a car in 90 degree weather for the weekend? or would it be destroyed? What would you do in my situation, camping at a music festival for the weekend.

When the increased amount of arcade machines brought in were the same one, or a little different, more and more people waiting in line to play, then came the price increase. Sometimes the game was out of order and waiting to be repaired. As we all slowly ran out of money and scrambled to find more to keep playing and keep up with the increase in price it became harder and harder. So we decided to take breaks whether it was forced upon us by being incarcerated from stealing, or the arcade closing at night, or even loved ones telling us to come home.

I didn't choose to quit playing I just ran out of cash and I'm waiting to play again. Other people begging for change, I'm one of the lucky ones to have a job and can get my moment in the sun once more. But life goes on without us so we have to keep the steady pace and hope alive otherwise we too will be swept under the rug. So here I sit, waiting for Friday to finally come and to let me revisit the arcade at least one more time, because all we have is right now and tomorrow is a different day. ",1534342939.0

Well after a lot of people did the same batch in philly, and a shitload of them ended up in the hospital, they tested the dope and found that it had synthetic cannabis/k2/spice in the dope.

That dope with spice in it does not feel good, it does not relieve wd symptoms, and when i got it a dozen different times it made me trip so bad that i shouldve been in the e.r. 

Its been showing up in dope for the past 3 years now that ive experienced, and the people making or cutting the dope must think they are making the dope feel stronger by adding that shit into it. Maybe if everyone that buys dope would tell their dealer whats been happening, it might go up the chain of dealers until it gets to the people responsible for putting it in. If they dont already know its bad and ruins the dope completely, maybe if enough people tell em they wont use it anymore.

At least alert all the other addicts you know about whats happening, and to start slow with new batches so us users dont die from that shit. Its gotta be lethal to inject too much spice, and i doubt theres anything the e.r. could even do for a spice overdose. All i know is that shit is horrible.

Do you think doing some of these things while using opiates could help me realize that it's okay to feel comfortable in these situations?

I feel like I have no hope, and may as well try something extreme.  I think medications typically used for anxiety are bullshit, and they always end up making me feel worse in the long run.  I have had opiates prescribed to me once, and when I took them I felt so at peace; and I never had any sort of rebound anxiety/was responsible with them.

In my experience withdrawals from both are extremely shitty, so i don't really get the difference.  Obviously if you're sure the oxy is pharm its a bit safer, but still both seem like equally crippling addictions, if anything an oxy habit is harder to support as it costs more, implying perhaps an even stronger level of addiction.

Rufus and I tore into it every time we woke up from a nod. Worse than that though between the two of us, one would always brag about the quality. If he didn‚Äôt brag about how good our dope was to some poor street junkie cooking up the typical vinegary, black goo in the bottom half of a coke can or spoon on the sidewalk, then I did. We traded hits for packs of cigarettes or five bucks or meth we didn‚Äôt really want or pills we didn‚Äôt need. So, sooner than it should have been, it was gone.

The morning after it ran out we sat in the park and did some of the dilaudid and morphine we‚Äôd obtained. It was the last day of the month. We‚Äôd have food stamps to trade soon, but until then, we would be bored and wait for someone to come along with a lick for us to hit or something to pass the time. Soon enough, Black Irish walked up to us.

Now, Black Irish was neither black nor was he Irish, at least not so far as I could tell. He looked like a Nazi after the war who had let his hair grow out. Our interaction with him was always the same. He offered us rancid protein shakes in bottles he‚Äôd purchased at 42 cents a bottle from the discount grocery store, where a package of deli cut turkey breast might look more like a package of green roast beef. That was Black Irish‚Äôs thing. Well, it was one of his things.

He also liked to tell people how much he loved them. Sometimes, he would mix his proclamation of love towards you in with veiled threats to your safety, but he said it a lot. It was part of the Christian community he was in and out of it so frequently, a rehab church. He was a self-appointed leader there and disciple maker when he wasn‚Äôt relapsing. Eventually, he started saying that he‚Äôd been called to teach other men how to relapse and come back from it. Black Irish was always angry, walking around with two clenched fists like hammer heads and gritting his teeth, but out of some religious duty, he always told us he loved us. 

Rufus and I had just lit cigarettes. Black Irish stood at our feet looking down at us. He eyed our cigarettes and licked his lips. His fists clenched, and he said,

‚ÄúHey, guys. I love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Black Irish.‚Äù We responded trying to hide our disappointment in having to talk to him.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing alright.‚Äù I never asked him how he was.

‚ÄúGood. I‚Äôm happy for you. Well, yeah, I‚Äôm doing pretty good myself.‚Äù I rolled my eyes. I didn‚Äôt want to know. ‚ÄúJust, you know, got back to my ministry at Hope Outreach downtown.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. We know where it is.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Good. You guys should come down sometime. I sure do love you guys. Would love to see you come in and come to a service.‚Äù He grunted as the visceral hatred he held in his guts towards us tried to escape his mouth. ‚ÄúReally‚Ä¶really love you guys.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. Yeah. You know, what? That sounds nice. Maybe we‚Äôll come see you there soon.‚Äù Rufus piped in.

‚ÄúOkay! Looking forward to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey. I have a pair of movie tickets here, but I can‚Äôt go to it. I've got work. Would you guys want to go see it?‚Äù Black Irish was always fasting from food or subjecting himself to humiliating employment as penance he decided God had decided for him to do. It never made sense. That‚Äôs how it was with him, though.

‚ÄúGuess so. What is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething about a mine in Alaska or something and women being mistreated there.‚Äù

‚ÄúJeesh. A lighthearted flick, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù He handed us the tickets. ‚ÄúLove you guys. See ya.‚Äù

‚ÄúK. See ya.‚Äù Rufus said.

We walked up to the movie theater. The entrance was part of an outdoor plaza in the mall. There was a large grassy hill where people sat. Kids played with bouncy balls, and parents lay on blankets. Rufus busted out a sticky brown roach and lit it. He took a few puffs, blew the smoke up and passed it to me.

‚ÄúMaybe we shouldn‚Äôt smoke here. There‚Äôs kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúNah..‚Äù He was holding the smoke in and talking. ‚ÄúNah. Just smoke it. We‚Äôll be done in a second.‚Äù

I shrugged. I took a few puffs. Before I could pass it back, I realized the smoke was blowing right towards the families and their kids. Rufus busted up in a fit of coughing. I followed, watery snot spraying out of my nose with the thick grey smoke plumes.  It burned like fire in the back of my nostrils.  We coughed hard. The parents of the children looked at us and shook their heads.

Eventually, we stopped coughing and walked into the theatre. A nerdy high school kid took our tickets and told us where the auditorium was. We had no money for soda and popcorn or any of that, but we did have a 200 milligram Kadian. Rufus and I went to the bathroom. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and took the cellophane off it. I opened the turquoise gel cap and poured the time release beads into the clear plastic that Rufus was holding open. He pulled out his lighter and crushed the beads against the stall divider. We poured the granulated powder into a cooker, dropped water on it and sucked it back up, half and half.

A flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came. We grunted simultaneously at the rush. I rubbed my face and capped my rig. It wasn‚Äôt a new one, so the needle got caught on the orange plastic cap and bent badly. Rufus watched it happen.

‚ÄúDang! Looks like that one‚Äôs spent.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Huh? I‚Äôve used worse.‚Äù There were at least six broken needles in my arms. There were seven before that. One had worked itself to the surface so that I could pick it out. The thing is that when they break and you try to grab them, your skin and fat pushes back up and swallows it before you can get it. I smiled and shrugged, dramatically throwing it into the toilet before I flushed it. We laughed and walked out.

In the theater, Rufus found a half-eaten box of popcorn that was cold and soggy. He also rounded up a few old beverages people left behind and mixed them together in the biggest cup. Rufus said it was flat and watery, maybe a mixture of Sprite, root beer and diet Coke. He wasn‚Äôt sure. But took long pulls of it through the straw between chewing the popcorn. The trailers started.

I always liked trailers more than movies. They were shorter. They were more action packed and emotionally stirring than the actual feature films. In high school, I realized that movies worth watching were few and far between. Movies didn‚Äôt do it for me. Most of the time, I was rooting for the good guys to fail and die so I could just go home and start mourning the $11.50 I‚Äôd wasted to see it as soon as possible. The sooner I started grieving it, the sooner I‚Äôd be over it.

Cinematic features had other problems, though, in my eyes. They were terribly unrealistic. And even when the storylines were relatable, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about how the actors were just acting. I‚Äôd heard about how partnerships or love stories on screen were actually terrible rivalries behind the scenes. They weren‚Äôt friends or in love. Like my life back when I used to go to the movies, before I went back to the streets, it was all fake. That was the most realistic thing about it. People pretended to be friends. They pretended to care. They pretended their lives mattered, and as I sat there watching that movie with Rufus, this was what I thought about. I didn‚Äôt have to worry about him being fake. He was broken like me. He stunk like me. He was filthy like me, but Rufus was also real. Rufus was my friend. He slept through the whole thing.

When we got out of the movie we walked up to see Ally Alcoholic. She was sitting on her bench. Rufus was getting sweet on her like he always did. He asked her if she had a clean, which she did. She gave it over, and we walked back to the spot to do whatever pill we decided to when we got there. It hit me then, the things I‚Äôd forgotten for over a week. I needed to break it to Rufus that he had to stop talking to her. I wondered how‚Äôd he take it. Would he accept it? He had to, or we‚Äôd be in big trouble. There was no second option. The Faceless One had ordered it.",1534282966.0
97cfzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/97cfzd/soo_last_week_i_got_kicked_out_of_rehab_for/,17,https://redd.it/97cfzd,mashnote,"Soo last week I got kicked out of rehab for withdrawing too hard. :| sent to jail, motion to revoke probation... anyone experienced something similar/have any idea what might happen to me?","Ok so. I'm hoping my fellow junkies here have maybe been in similar programs and have some idea of how this all might play out. Really if anyone can shed some light, any light, on this clusterf-k predicament... I'd be so grateful... Sorry about the wall of text, it's really a lot of details over a simple thing, just trying not to miss anything...

Last Nov I committed a serious crime for which I am genuinely remorseful. Drove drunk and crashed into an empty parked vehicle - no one was hurt thank god, and insurance covered property damage. This is my 2nd DWI; first was 8 years ago. I pled into ""DWI Court"" which is like a modified probation focused on I guess addiction recovery. It begins with a three month intensive outpatient program - group therapy 9 hours a week, going before the judge every week, etc... and of course random UAs. I have had a serious speedball addiction for a couple years now, so... I pissed dirty... 

They had me sign an agreement saying that I was not to use substances any more, and start having individual sessions with their assigned therapist in addition to everything else, and so on... Long story short I'm a complete idiot and piss dirty a second time at the end of the week. Come Monday my probation officer tells me to get to evening group early in order to drop another UA, because ""in light of the 2nd positive UA, the office will be making a recommendation to the judge, and if this UA comes out negative it will be one thing, if it comes positive it will be something else"". Welp that did it, 3rd positive UA...

So the next day I have court, got to go before the judge. Before court commences, the court officer pulls me aside for a private meeting. She tells me that because of what I'm dirty for (opiates), they're very worried about me. I start crying saying I don't want to be a criminal and I'm very sorry for my actions and want to do what it takes not to do something hurtful like that again (all true)... she tells me it's not even the criminal aspect they're concerned about at this point, it's my health and safety. Says they're referring me to the county-run rehab for a 5 month run. 

It's not too bad, I've had friends that have done it... it's a little similar to jail since it's county run but not even really, I mean the beds and uniforms are similar but the food is better, and super low security... you can technically leave out the door at any time, but it's an automatic state felony for ""absconding"" that carries 2 year sentence, and apparently the sheriffs usually find people in like an hour. My point is, it's better than jail and hey, I fucked up, and hey, I do need help with this addiction, so I was/am down.

So the court officer lady tells me they want me to check in by the following Monday, which is less than a week to get my affairs in order, and that basically if I refuse it would trigger a motion to revoke my probation/all kinds of bad stuff. Then she asked me if I was going to need to be referred to a detox facility first, or at least that's how interpreted her questions at the time, about if I expected to get very very sick. She definitely at least made it clear that they did not expect me to be able to drop this habit on my own, that they did expect me to be detoxing at first. And I said, yeah you're right, and I do expect to get sick, but I don't think it will be anything life-threatening.

Ok. So. I check in to the rehab. Part of my intake was signing a bunch of forms, one of which listed the ""rights"" I have, which included going to the hospital when I want. It was also made clear to me that upon checking in to the rehab, I was switching to a new probation officer that works there at the rehab. I am immediately completely honest with the nurses about my use, expected withdrawal, etc, and with the doctor that examined me the first morning. The girl in the bunk under me is kicking way harder than I am, and I come to learn that she did go to the hospital one of her peak days. 

Anyway, the nurses give me OTC stuff twice a day for my symptoms, Imodium Ibuprofen etc., but it's rough. Come day 3, my dormies are pressuring me to ask to go to the hospital, saying I really don't look good etc. So I do, and the staff basically say they are ""working on it"" for THREE HOURS... my dormies keep telling me it's a violation of my rights and that they got sent right away on request, etc. So they kinda start pressuring the staff on my behalf... three hours later the staff take me to a back room saying all of a sudden that someone needs to be with me at all times, and then finally to another back room, my new PO's office, where I meet my new PO for the first time. Two cops there as well. My new PO tells me there has been a warrant issued for my arrest and that they will be taking me to jail after the ER.

Why? Because ""this facility is not equipped to take care of you. Jail is. This is not a detox facility."" Says that after I'm done detoxing at jail for one or two weeks, I will be returned to the rehab. I'm freaking tf out, saying I don't understand, that I've tried to follow all the rules and be honest and that this is not what I was told before, and that why if the other girls are kicking harder and went, etc... she just says every case is different and that in my case this is what the court ordered. 

The ER gave me a weak Ativan prescription which did follow me to jail, thank god, and to my immense surprise, the next morning the judge DID set a bond for me?! So my BF bails me out. I would've thought they wouldn't let me leave since I was supposed to be finishing my detox there and then return to rehab? But apparently my official ""status"" now is full-blown Motion to Revoke Probation. Guys I am freaking tf out. If I get my probation revoked I could be looking at 180 days in jail to my understanding. My attorney doesn't even understand what happened; he and my family and everyone is basically assuming that I MUST have broken a rule or committed a crime to get a MTRP, he was asking me if I had brought drugs, etc. 

I did have two auxiliary thoughts occur to me. 1) I overheard a conversation right before they took me away to arrest me, where the girl who was kicking hard and went to the hospital, was complaining that someone had ""snitched"" on her for apparently having her dealer meet her at the hospital and using while she was there. So I wonder if that affected how they dealt with me? and, 2) the hospital staff were saying that my readings were actually ok and that my kick wasn't that bad, but it sure felt bad to me, and so I wonder if I was having a panic attack essentially. I had told my therapist in the outpatient program that I have panic attacks ever since my father got charged with four felonies and might spend his life in prison and I've been managing his affairs, and that I was just about to start a Xanax script for my symptoms before I pled into DWI court which does not allow any narcotic meds even prescribed. I wonder if they might consider this anxiety disorder as a mitigating factor.

My next court date is in a week and my attorney thinks I should check in to a 30 day private rehab to kind of do what they wanted me to do, and that he could ""probably"" get the court date pushed back if I did that and use it as a selling point to not revoke my probation. But he also works in a different county and admits he has no idea how this system here works, he's just guessing that would be an option. But I suspect it might ""have"" to be the state-run one... I'm meeting with a local attorney that DOES have experience handling DWI's HERE in this county, tomorrow.

But in the meantime I am still panicking. And yes, using. \*\*I'm not asking for legal advice,\*\* I just want to know if anyone has seen anything remotely similar to this go down, or just if anyone has anything to say at all about this bizarre situation. 

\*\*TLDR:\*\* 2nd DWI, pled into DWI court including IOP, dropped dirty UAs, got referred to state-run rehab and told it would be ok to detox there, got sent to jail from state-run rehab for kicking too hard, now my probation is in ""motion to revoke"" status, freaking tfffff out.",1534282651.0

As I can assume from the posts on the front page you guys are, as you call yourselves, ""opiate enthusiasts""!

Regardless, I would guess some of you guys ~~(maybe most?)~~ have been in contacts with **people in higher up-positions like** the police, maybe even jail, people working at different institutes, social workers and so forth. (edited because worded badly and to be fair insulting, I'm sorry)


I work at a treatment home where the clients are there by their own will while undergoing a sort of replacement therapy for opioid dependence, which means they are on either Buprenorphine or Methadone which is given to them daily while undergoing therapy. 

These guys are mostly ""ex"" criminals in that sense they're not actively doing criminal activity right now. Most of them have gone to criminality to sustain their high use of all kind of substances, mostly opiates. 

Even though they are there by their free will and driven to stay drug-free for reasons like they have kids, they are afraid to die etc., having relapses and not returning to treatment is very usual. Most of the time when they have relapses it's because of anxiety of some sort.

My question to you guys is how can I as a social worker be better at understanding their feelings to mostly opiates and help them in their own will to be drug-free? 

Is it something you'd like to ask me, teach me, etc., feel free, I will try to answer and listen to you all.

**‚Ä¢Nutrition:** how do you keep fed while puking/shitting your guts out? Any specific foods or brands that you SWEAR by that you want on hand if you have a say in the matter?
 
** -** do you utilize vitamin pills/supplements or the like to help maintain nutrition levels? 
How about so-called ""natural remedies""?

**‚Ä¢Comfort:** how do you get through the kicking legs, the horrible body aches and the relentless yawning and tears?

**‚Ä¢The Endless and Incessant Thoughts:** be this the mind numbing boredom, the horrible fiend crave or the deep pit of depression that accompanies the lack of drug.

I am mainly looking for things you can do that do NOT require being given another scrip or drug. 
* This can include if you all feel helped especially by legal CBD and Kratom but they need to **be able to be procured from a store in your neighborhood, not necessarily the internet or illegal means.** *

* Specifically, I don't want to keep hearing to go to the doc to get benzos or methadone or subs or just get weed because let's get real, it just doesn't always work that way. (I will concede to weed but because it isn't legal everywhere, it isn't always the most viable. And yes I do realize that most of our withdrawal are caused by illegal drugs). *

I am aware that this is a topic that is pretty widely touched on already here in this sub but I guess I was looking for a little something more, information wise.

My ears began to ring and my vision went black. I couldn‚Äôt breathe, like I had just gotten the wind knocked out of me. I could tell Amy was trying to get me up but I was no longer there, my spirit had vanished.¬†

Reality forced itself back onto me, no matter how much I didnt want to let it back in. My stomach churned and bubbled and I could taste that watery taste that always precedes that kind of throwing up that doesnt feel good when its over. When I was a drinker, during life before opiates, I could remember being drunk and welcoming a good puke, sometimes even forcing it.¬†

This was different. I felt my cold sweat get hot, my forehead dripping big syrupy drops into my clammy palms where it rested.¬†

‚ÄúAre you ok Slim? Slim, talk to me!‚Äù Amy demanded. I looked up at her and then back at the pavement.¬†

As I began to open my mouth, I was planning to try and tell her I was ok. Instead I vomitted onto the pavement where I was kneeling, splashing black bile and stomach acid onto my knees and hoodie sleeves. And then I was lost, puking over and over, so hard and with such fury I couldnt even stop to try and inhale, and I began to suffocate as my bodily functions betrayed me. I would gasp and cough and snot would shoot out of my nostrils. My eyes were crying, not that I was crying for the lost $40, or the fact I had been disowned by the only family I had left willing to put up with me, or the fact I was kneeling in snow and ice and now puke and stomach acid, with no home and no friends I trusted. I was crying because I was vomiting so hard the pressure was forcing all of the fluid in my head out.¬†

When it finally was over, Amy was whimpering, tears in her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúI am so sorry.‚Äù she said, and crouched over me from behind, wrapping her arms around me.¬†

‚ÄúI really cant believe he did that.‚Äù

.....

Jeff was from Atlanta, by way of Haiti. He had the darkest skin I have ever seen on a black man, and his dreads were long. He wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as tall as me, but he had that kind of frame that I knew meant he could probably murder someone with his bare hands, if he had good reason to do so.

I had heard about him from Amy, and then again from Matt when I sat on the filthy wood floor in his tiny room, smoking cigarettes and just being happy I wasnt outside in the snow.¬†

‚ÄúBro, he came down here last weekend and we sat in this room for like 36 hours, doing nothing but getting fucking GEEKED!‚Äù Matt said, smiling and throwing a fist in the air in triumph.¬†

‚ÄúNo bullshit he had like a quarter of soft, maybe more, and we smoked the whole shit.‚Äù Matt said, lighting another Marlboro red.¬†

‚ÄúWho chef‚Äôed it though?‚Äù I asked, hoping I might find an opportunity to use my most prized skill. I had learned to cook crack cocaine in Richmond. Sure, like everyone else, I had first tried to learn to cook crack from the internet, googling and reading different TEKs and watching youtube videos. Cocaine is expensive. Cooking it into crack so it could be smoked required experience and skill, and it was easy to fuck it up. I had personally ruined at least a few grams trying to learn. Sometimes it came out ok, smokeable at least. Sometimes it was a complete loss, depending on the quality of the powder. So when one of my boys from Richmond had began to use my kitchen to cook his shit, I kept asking him to teach me. At first, he refused. He would call me, usually about once a week, and say ‚ÄúYo I need to use the kitchen.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOk, come through, Im here.‚Äù I would reply, excited to get the crack he would give me for letting him do his thing in my house. The first couple of times he came over and cooked, I tried to nonchalantly watch him, but he would turn around and say ‚ÄúYo please dont crowd me bro, I‚Äôll be done in a minute.‚Äù I thought about and realized that I would probably want to be left alone too, since he was in the process of converting his $900 investment into $1800, and if he fucked it up, it would be a catastrophic financial loss. The more I thought about it, I began to change how I behaved around him when he was there to cook. I started keeping the kitchen clean all the time, instead of leaving dirty dishes all in the sink and on the counters. When he came over the 3rd and 4th time to cook, I had the water in the pot simmering, the pyrex clean and dry, fresh unopened boxes of Arm & Hammer on the counter, next to a clean knife, spoon, and fork I had flattened.¬†

He noticed these preparations and then one day he showed up and said ‚ÄúYou are going to help me this time, you cool with that?‚Äù¬†

Learning how to cook cocaine is not done overnight. Sure, the process isnt too complicated: you add sodium bicarbonate to cocaine hydrochloride, usually in a ratio of about 1:3, then some water, which you heat until the bicarbonate reacts with the cocaine and begins to bond to it. Once the reaction is about done, you remove the heat, let it cool, and remove the new crack cocaine from the water, let it dry, and its ready to smoke.¬†

But there were so many variables. How much baking soda to add depended on the quality of the cocaine powder. How much had the cocaine powder been cut, and what adulterants had been added was a major variable as well. Learning to identify the quality of cocaine powder required experience and knowing what to look for. Was the cocaine powder still hard and in chunks, or ‚Äúblocked up‚Äù as I called it, or was it just a bag of powder, like a ziploc full of flour? Did it have a shine to it, little crystals that reacted to the light? If it was blocked up, did it have a grain when you broke a piece off, like a slab of granite, or was it repress, which meant someone had cut it already and then put it in a hydraulic press and squeezed it back together, making it appear to be higher quality than it was. The cocaine game, like most of the drug game, is complex and dynamic, and people were always trying to find new and innovative ways to make more money.

I learned all these skills and nuances, just like any apprentice shadowing a mastered artist, during my time in Richmond. My boy that taught me to cook ended up becoming one of my closest friends, and he taught me so much about the game and life in general. When I moved back up north, I gave him my favorite possession, a digital jewelers scale that measured accurately to the thousands, 3 digits to the right of the 0.¬†

‚ÄúI want you to make a million dollars with this, Fortune 5000‚Äù I said when I handed it to him, using the nickname I had given him. Cooking crack was something I did better than anyone else I had ever met since I had left Richmond, better even than the d boys I met in the projects or on the block in New Bedford. I was Heisenberg of that crack shit.¬†

‚ÄúSlim can cook like a mad scientist‚Äù Amy said to Matt. ‚ÄúYou gotta see my bro in action.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù Matt said, looking a bit puzzled. ‚ÄúDude can you show me? Because I suck at it. I mean I can do it, but I dunno, its like its always a little bit off, I only get lucky and get it right every once in a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds like you probably use too much water‚Äù I said, snubbing out my cigarette in the ash tray. ‚ÄúIts easy to cook, but its not easy to do it the right way every time. I can help you though, I‚Äôd be happy to.‚Äù

‚ÄúSweet!‚Äù Matt squeaked in excitement. ‚ÄúIm gonna text Jeff now, see whats up.‚Äù¬†

A few minutes passed, and then Jeff replied to Matt‚Äôs text. He was working, and woudnt be home til late that night. I asked Matt ‚ÄúDo you have any money? I mean I can call someone if you want, thats no probem.‚Äù I was hoping he did, cause I needed to make every penny I could, and any chance to middle man a package meant I would profit in some way. It did not matter the drug, the amount, or the circumstances around the transaction. I could out-hustle anyone, I was a scorpion, cold, calculated, and dangerous when I needed to be. I kept a box of sandwich bags, a box of baking soda, a bottle of miralax, and a bottle of benefiber in my backpack with me, 24/7. I was always prepared to cook, cut, and bag up. It was how I survived.¬†

‚ÄúNo, no money, but Im telling you bro, Jeff has a shitload of coke. He had a fucking black trash bag of it when he walked in here this weekend.‚Äù

I would come to find out much later, that Jeff was perpetrating a huge lie to everyone he met. He talked about being ‚Äúplugged in‚Äù, and because he was from ATL, most people just assumed he must have been what he claimed to be. He claimed he got his bricks in the mail every month. He claimed he was connected to Meech and BMF. He claimed he had a fucking arsenal of guns. What I ended up learning much later that summer, was that Jeff was a pathological liar and a bullshit artist, a fraud so full of shit his eyes were brown. He wasnt getting anything in the mail but past-due bills, definitely not kilos of cocaine. He did have a trashbag full of cocaine that one weekend like Matt said, and they did smoke around a half ounce, like 14 grams, but he only had it because he had robbed an actual drug dealer at gun point that same night he walked into Matts room pretending he was Scarface.¬†

But I didnt know this yet. In my mind, I was thinking I had just found a reason to hope I would be cooking and smoking coke very soon, probably even finding an opportunity to shoot some powder, and I was already imagining the joyous rush of cocaine I hoped Id be having sometime in the very near future.

Matt and Amy kept insisting I meet Jeff, and I eventually did. The house Matt lived in was a boarders house about a 5 minute walk from the Hyannis Bus Terminal. It had around 6 different bedrooms that were rented by the month, a shared kitchen and a few shared bathrooms. Matts room was on the first floor in the back, and had a seperate door to the outside, which was cool. Jeffs room was upstairs, through the main entrance, and was flanked by a room on each side, one of which was vacant. When I met Jeff, Amy and I went up to his room with him, and we talked and bullshitted while he told me about himself and his connections. He said he had been born in Haiti, that much was obvious, and that his mother had abandoned him in the hospital as a newborn, to go back to the streets of Haiti and her crack addiction. He was quick to point out he was a crack baby. He was adopted by his grandmother, who lived in ATL, and moved there when he was 10. Then at some point his mother also moved to ATL, and he moved in with her. I will never forget him telling me how his mother had ashtrays overflowing with crack stems like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. I could only feel sorrow and empathy for him when he told me that, I knew what that meant. I felt a little pang of guilt for being raised by parents that didnt smoke coke or shoot dope, even if they were divorced and my childhood was traumatic.¬†

Jeff wasnt all bad. He was just a con artist. I eventually figured his whole hustle out, just like I do with anyone I spend any real time with. He would claim, like he did with me that night, that he had never smoked crack, that he only had ever just sniffed coke. I had some coke, and I cooked it in a spoon on his coffee table while he watched me with the focus of a hawk. I could tell he was shocked and impressed when I flicked a yellow boulder out onto the lotto ticket on the table to dry, looking up to smile at him.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôll put some hair on your chewing gum‚Äù I said, in the best Early Cuyler voice I could muster.

‚ÄúDamn that does look pretty good‚Äù Jeff said. ‚ÄúI dont know though, I aint never smoked that shit before, I‚Äôm not sure I should‚Äù

‚ÄúYou absolutely shouldnt‚Äù I said, and I meant it. ‚ÄúYou do at your own peril, trust me my dude. You shouldnt ever take the panties of this bitch. I‚Äôll give you some powder if you wanna sniff. I just wanted to show you I can chef. I dont want to turn you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù Jeff said, grabbing a stem and bringing it his lips. ‚ÄúI want to see what this is all about‚Äù.

So Jeffs hustle was that he pretended he had never smoked crack before. People were always generous with someone smoking coke their first time, he had figured that out and was exploiting it.¬†

I tell you about Jeff for a good reason.¬†

Jeff and I became cool, and he knew I was homeless. He looked out for me on a few occasions, telling me I could sleep in the vacant room next to his. I had to leave by 6am, and it was just an empty room, but it was shangra la compared to being hunched over in some bando too cold and too scarred to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. I would take my hoodie off, fold it up, lay it on top of my backpack, and kind of lean against it in a half reclined half laid down position. I would wake up and my legs would be numb, my back screaming at me, but when your homeless you come to appreciate things others would claim intolerable. I wasnt comfortable, but I was safe and warm. You also learn what it means to be truly grateful when you are on the streets. Jeff barely knew me, but letting me crash in that room put him at risk because it could end up coming back on him if I was caught, or caught the house on fire, or refused to leave when 6am came. I always made sure to thank him and I never got caught or fucked up his situation.¬†

So anyway, one night, probably about a month after Sean jumped in the Honda and left me to die on the sidewalk that day, Jeff and I were sitting on the front porch his house, me smoking newport reds, him smoking a blunt. It was dark out, probably like 10pm, and we were just bullshitting when all of a sudden, we see a figure appear in the street, walking slowly towards us. As the walking figure got within eyesight, I immediately recognized who it was, someone I hadnt seen for a long time, no matter how much I had looked and asked others where he was.¬†

It was Sean, the same pony tailed greasy sack of shit that had looked me in the eyes promising me relief only to leave me to die in the street.¬†

‚ÄúJeff, stay right here, I gotta go handle something‚Äù I whispered, standing up out of the wooden Adirondack chair.¬†

‚ÄúWhere you going nigga?‚Äù Jeff asked in his strong drawl, half Haitian and half southern.

‚ÄúI gotta go do this thing real quick‚Äù I said, as I walked down off the porch towards Sean.¬†

Sean looked at me coming towards him and immediately I saw terror on his face. I went into my pocket for the boxcutter I had, and I heard him say ‚ÄúOhhhh shiiiiit‚Äù but after that I went black.

I came to, hand covered in blood, standing over Sean writhing around on the pavement, and realized what I had down.¬†

‚ÄúMy face!!! My fucking face!!!‚Äù Sean screamed, clutching at the piece of cheek hanging from his jaw.¬†

‚ÄúShut the fuck up you little bitch or I‚Äôll give the other buck fifty and make it a whole 3 dollars‚Äù I seethed. ‚ÄúYou really thought you wouldnt ever see me again? Your lucky I dont open up your windpipe and let you leak out on GP. Pick your shit up and get the fuck out my face, and dont ever cross my path again or I might finish what I started on you.‚Äù¬†

This wasnt me. I dont know who the person speaking out of my mouth was, but I didnt protest much either. I was due some payback, some actual balancing of the karmic scales. Sean had robbed me of my last $40, and he did it in a way that was cowardly and disgusting. He could have shorted my bag and gotten over on me, but I still would have gotten well and it would have been nothing more than another drug deal. Instead, I later learned that the boys he called who he absconded with that day didnt even HAVE DOPE. They only hustled coke. Sean was NEVER planning to help me, he was going to beat me from the jump.

Sean picked himself up off the ground just as Jeff came off the porch scolding me. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck wrong with you Slim. Now the fucking feds gon be here, you better hope this white boy dont call police. I dont need this kind of heat my nigga, you gotta relax.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBro this that bitch that beat me when I was on my death bed, remember I told you a while back about it. Fuck all that police shit, he knows better.‚Äù Sean immediately mumbled ‚ÄúIm not gonna call proliceeee‚Äù and the 3 of us all realized at that moment, that Sean's mouth and his speech were fucked up from the laceration reaching from his ear to his lip crease.¬†

‚ÄúJust go, faggot‚Äù I said, as the guilt started creeping in. I never was violent by nature. I abhorred hurting people, to be honest. But I had learned as a young man, sometimes others leave you no choice. Not acting would be like saying ‚Äúits ok to hurt me‚Äù. So I did what the fuck needed to be done. I‚Äôd push it down and away, like so much of what I had experienced, and deal with it later.

I never saw Sean again. Not that he wasnt still out and around. People always told me when they saw him. No, he was making it his job to avoid me at any cost. And he disappeared into the fog of my past, eventually becoming a forgotten memory.

Also the withdrawal is absolutely hell even with 24 mg of bupe.

A twin mattress faced a tiny TV that had to be from the early 1990‚Äôs. The bed sheets were mismatched and had human hair on them. The blanket was filthy. I slept in my clothes on the top of the bed.

It was late March, and it had snowed again the night before. I woke up shivering, chilled to the bone, incapable of getting my body temperature to rise. There was no heat in the room, no way to warm up. I attempted to take a hot shower as a last resort but the shower didn‚Äôt work. 
The motel room had been paid for by a clinic I had been getting my suboxone from. I had called my counselor/doctor there the day I became homeless and had told him what happened. He had put me in touch with another counselor there and she had gotten me the room for 3 nights. Checkout was in 4 hours.

I decided it made no sense to sit in the room til 10:30am. I was homeless and about to be on the street in the winter, 6 inches of snow on the ground, 35 degrees in the day, 25 and sometimes 10 at night. My fate had been decided. I was facing a world I had never been in, and I was truly afraid. 

Ok so I haven‚Äôt told you everything yet. Being homeless was already terrifying and dangerous, but I also had another problem, a major one. I was out of suboxone, had $40 to my name, and I was beginning to get really sick. Being dope sick in the warmth and safety of your own home was intolerable, so the prospect of being dope sick on the street in freezing cold weather with nowhere to go was about the closest thing to hell on earth I could imagine. So I decided to leave the motel room and get to the block. Maybe I could find someone with dope for sale. I had $40 which would get me at least enough heroin to keep me well for the day into the night, if I was smart about how much I did. I just had to find someone to buy from. 
I walked out of the motel room wearing the only clothes I had: a grey winter beanie on my head, a grey hoodie (hood up), a pair of dark blue jeans, my black tactical backpack, and a pair of camouflage air max. 

I trekked through the snow across the street and headed down to the bus station where almost always a few street kids or homeless drunks could be found. I‚Äôd driven by them a million times, now I was one of them. I wondered if they would accept me or if I would be shunned. I wondered if I‚Äôd end up dead in some bando with a blade buried in my ear, pockets pulled out of my jeans like rabbit ears. I wondered about my future. 

Around 8am I saw Amy, and she immediately knew what kind of shape I was in:

‚ÄúYou look like shit bro. Do you need a sub?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, fuck subs, I need dope.‚Äù I said, stubbornly.

‚ÄúBabe just take a sub - you will feel better and not waste your money‚Äù she countered, and she was right. 

‚ÄúNah I want to get dope sis. It gotta be dope. I‚Äôm fucking homeless out here in March. I stayed clean for 2 months for nothing. I‚Äôm not gonna be on the street and not use.
I need to get on and leave the disaster that has become my life behind for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk hun I understand but if you decide you want a sub just tell me. But I‚Äôm sure we can find you something, how much do you have?‚Äù

‚Äú$40, and I want at least a .4‚Äù 

‚ÄúYea ok lets go over to the Jamaican store and see who we bump into‚Äù

Amy and I had met a few days before, and she had taken on the role of defacto street Mom to me. When she introduced me to other people on the street, she would say:

‚ÄúAnd this is my brother Slim. Oh you didn‚Äôt know I had a brother? Yup, he just got out of prison.‚Äù

I had watched her closely as she had taken me under her wing me in the previous 3 days. I had the motel room those first 3 nights. Now I was truly homeless. At first I suspected she was just trying to set me up for a quick lick, like trying to see if I was worth anything, if I had anything she wanted, etc. But she had been nothing but genuine and compassionate to me, so I was starting to trust her.
As we walked to the Jamaican store, Amy asked everyone we bumped into if they knew where we could find some dope. It made no sense really. Any other day there were 50 people around with heroin for sale. I ended up needing it the one morning of the month that nobody had anything. Then just as we arrived at the store, we bumped into Sean.
I had seen Sean a few times before, and he always had the same clothes on: Black sweat pants, raggedy white new balance sneakers, a black Boston College sweatshirt and his slick black hair, pulled into a pony tail. I had actually met him once when I had been staying at the hotel with the jacuzzis in the rooms, partying with a couple girls. I was walking through the hotel hallways looking for an ice machine and I came across him, down in the back hallway of the hotels bowels. I spoke to him briefly, later realizing he was basically squatting down there, probably because he had no where else to go.
Amy flagged Sean down and told him what the situation was. 

‚ÄúYeah I can get that for you right now, what did you need?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúLook man, Im going to make this simple for you. I don‚Äôt let my bread walk. So it‚Äôs like this: you can bring your people to me and I transact with them, or you can put your money up for it and then sell it to me. But you ain‚Äôt taking my cash and dipping, leaving me to wait for you to come back.‚Äù

‚ÄúBro I totally understand, I absolutely get it‚Äù.

‚ÄúMan I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick, it‚Äôs just I am sick as fuck, I‚Äôm getting worse, and this is the last $40 I got so I have to get straight or I‚Äôm gonna be fucked‚Äù

He looked me straight in my eyes and said ‚Äúlisten man, I‚Äôve been there. I‚Äôve been sick like you are, I‚Äôm not going to do that to you. I know how it feels to be that sick, I couldn‚Äôt do that to you‚Äù
 
‚ÄúOk so how do we do this?‚Äù I asked him.

Before he could answer, Amy jumped in front of him and said ‚ÄúSean don‚Äôt fuck around. This is my brother. If you do any dirty shit I swear to god I will hunt you down and I will cut you.‚Äù 

Sean paused and looked at Amy for a moment, and then blurted out ‚ÄúAmy I know you are crazy I‚Äôm not stupid ok, believe me I know.‚Äù

At this point I was starting to think Sean would play fair. I told him I would break off a piece of dope for him if my package was correct, and I planned to do just that. Being stingy in the street, homeless or not, is ill advised. Felony favors aren‚Äôt free. 
Sean made a phone call, and then proceeded to explain what was going to happen.

‚ÄúOk so my dude is on the way here. When he pulls up I will go to his car with your cash and grab it from him through his window, then walk right back to you. I‚Äôll never leave your sight.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo bro, I told you, my money doesn‚Äôt walk.‚Äù At that same moment I could feel the withdrawal symptoms beginning to go into overdrive. I had maybe 30 minutes before I would be incapable of controlling my bowels anymore, and once I took that first shit, what I call ‚Äúbreaking the seal‚Äù, I would be vacating my bowels for the next 4 hours, eventually squirting diarrhea to the point that my asshole would burn from passing so much shit and acidic stomach bile. I was beginning to panic on the inside, knowing that if this thing I was trying to do with Sean didn‚Äôt work out I was gonna be in real trouble. It was fucking freezing out, but I was soaked in cold sweat. My nose was pouring clear snot. My eyes were running, my muscles starting to burn and ache. 

Sean made another call, and then looked at me and said ‚Äúyo my dude don‚Äôt want to meet new people so it‚Äôs either I take your money to him or it can‚Äôt happen‚Äù. I looked at Amy, and she said ‚ÄúI think you can trust him. If he does anything, he knows I‚Äôm gonna cut him from ear to ear.‚Äù 
Now normally, in this situation, I always stood my ground. I refuse to let people take my money and buy for me; if I can‚Äôt handle the business then we can‚Äôt do business. But I was desperate. He seemed sincere. Amy made me feel like Sean understood the dire repercussions he would face if he took off with my cash. So against my better judgement I agreed to let Sean walk to the car with my last $40. 
When the car pulled up, it drove past us on the sidewalk and stopped about 10 yards away. I handed Sean the 2 twenty dollar bills from my pocket and watched him as he walked to the car. 
He immediately opened the rear door behind the driver. Ok, I thought, he‚Äôs gonna get in to transact. Maybe dudes window was up. 
He pulled the car door closed and the next thing I heard was him saying ‚ÄúYo GO GO GO!!!‚Äù And with that I watched my money drive away in a late model teal Honda Accord, two Dominican kids from providence in front, Sean in back, turned around looking at me to see if I was going to try to chase.
I lifted my hand and made a pistol with my fingers, pointed it at him, and made the ‚ÄúBang‚Äù motion. 
The car turned fast and hard around the corner and was gone.

So I made a purchase from a reputable online vendor recently. I usually purchase Afghan #4 but after trying some really good street tar I decided I wanted to find an online tar vendor. I found one who advertises their product as gun powder but everyone in reviews and other places mentioned it is actually tar, though a very good quality tar. 

When I received package this stuff was in a bag but looked super dry almost crusty brown looking, texture of wood, matte finish. When I took it out of the bag, it immediately started soaking up humidity from the air and turned into the the blackest tar I‚Äôve seen yet. Not super sticky but u could tell it was tar as before it looked weird. Now the thing that is tripping me out is the smell. It smells completely different than the vinegar smell I know and love from street tar. I do not shoot up, I usually do monkey water in a spray bottle or turn to cheese. But this stuff smells so bad/unique that I wonder if this is cut with something or maybe it has something added to it to turn into that wood consistency for easy shipping or to pass off as gun powder? Figured if anyone knew what was up it would be you guys. I tried some last night, only 0.02 to test it out as it is supposed to be really strong but I didn‚Äôt feel much just fell asleep. I would really appreciate the help. Thanks guys and gals. ",1534255668.0

This feels wrong, is it true? 

I was under the impression that it was only to be used in the event of a legitimate overdose. 

I would never waste narcan and I certainly don't have any interest in undoing the effects of my oxy or morphine but hypothetically what would happen if someone was decently high (but not OD'ing) and took the naloxone spray? Would it immediately undo the high? Would there be any other side effects?

(I need you all to know that I‚Äôm not an opiate user or addict.  Like the rest of us, though, my drug of choice has always been ‚Äúmore‚Äù.)  I‚Äôve been saddled with treatment-resistant clinical depression for about 20 years now, and this last week has been quite bad; I‚Äôve basically been holed up in my room for the majority of the time.  The reading & identifying have helped me to stay (relatively) sane, and so I want to thank all of you for all that you say & share.  (I‚Äôm also a drunk & drug addict in recovery, thank my maker.)

Often, when I‚Äôm quite depressed, I struggle to put cogent thoughts together, and can have difficulty writing well, which is extraordinarily frustrating for me.  That said, I‚Äôll do my best here.

It might be tempting for some to think that I‚Äôm treating my pain by marveling at the misery of others, but I am truly not a sadist, nor do I ever take any joy in the sorrow of another soul.  It would be more accurate to say that I find it comforting to be among my kind.   Drunks, junkies, stoners, freaks, those with one sort of mental illness or another...  it‚Äôs been my experience that we all have lived a certain special type of agony that cannot be adequately explained on the written page, or by the spoken word.  (We‚Äôve long since stopped trying to explain this kind of thing to the layman.)

As I read the various posts & stories, I see myself in each of them.  From the seeming-and-fleeting happiness in the early years of my using, to the untold hell of an addicted life, to the yearning for recovery while achieving none, to finally getting & living clean.   I‚Äôm reading it all from each of you, and it‚Äôs all me too.

It seems that my depression is a demon which may have reeked more pain & destruction on my life than any other, over the years.  This is the one demon from which I simply have not been able to achieve significant, sustained recovery.  I do honestly wonder if I ever will.  On nights like tonight, I do a lot of doubting.

Finally, two years ago, I was sponsoring a new kid in the deal who was about 90 days clean.  Rob, a recovering heroin addict.  I loved that kid.  He was me when I got sober.   He was just like me.   We worked together for weeks.  And then one single day passed without him calling me, as he always did. The next day, I got the call.  Yeah, that one.  Done.  One shot.  Over.   I was absolutely devastated.

I don‚Äôt want that to be me today, and I don‚Äôt want it to be you either.  But it‚Äôs gonna be somebody.  That‚Äôs just the fucked up reality of this thing.  Because of being able to read what you say, I‚Äôm just a little better tonight than I would otherwise have been, and I thank you all for that most sincerely.  Similarly, all of you continue to help, protect, encourage & save each other by saying & sharing all that you do.

I may not necessarily have a lot to offer, but I feel strongly compelled to express my thanks.

My diagnosis is post laminectomy syndrome with arachnoiditis and bilateral radiopathy. Conservative methods like epidurals, PT, spinal cord stim, non-opioid pain killers do not work to control my pain.  Doctor after doctor is dropping their opioid patients, finding them too big a risk to their license.  The last doctor to discharge me admitted opioids were appropriate for me (I was in compliance, no increases in dose, no alternative treatments, etc) but fears all the crackdowns happening.

I am about to try and find a new pain doc, just want to figure out some of the puzzling behavior of my last doctor and his PA.  The pain doc was pressuring me to get epidurals and other procedures already demonstrated and fully documented to make my condition worse (all the epidurals caused arachnoiditis.)  He also seemed angry I wouldn‚Äôt pay $9K out of pocket for a procedure because my insurance won‚Äôt cover it (considered experimental.)  The procedure offered little relief in the past anyway, barely above what might be the placebo effect (RFA.)  His PA was constantly pressuring me to report I was in less pain than I actually was.  If I didn‚Äôt cave to their pressures, they made indications they would discharge me.  I was eventually discharged when I asked my doctor to fill out forms to activate my temporary disability insurance.  

As I was discharged while in compliance, I am not sure what to tell the next pain management doc.  I need this stuff to live, without I am in so much pain I am bed-ridden and constantly contemplating suicide- not in a depressed way, just in a escaping misery kind of way.  I am by no means an addict, I am a responsible father and husband with good ties to the community.  While other opioids do make me high, the hydrocodone I am on does not impair me (or give me feeling of euphoria) even at the high dose i‚Äôm on (80 mg total a day.)

Is anyone out there that can provide me with insights into pain doctor‚Äôs minds.  Why are they pressuring me in ways that are counter to my care?  How should I respond so that I can attain a high standard of care for my condition?

I wish I didn‚Äôt need opioids to live.  Life had become so hard since the new regulations, life has been absolute hell.  Before anyone asks, I have an odd brain chemistry.  Weed makes me psychotic, so does ultram (makes me have violent and suicidal impulses.)  Not willing to take illegal drugs.

I can't help but flood my opioid receptors with natural and semi-synthetic opioids everyday. The moment I felt heroin, I felt curiosity about such a peculiar feeling. And the moment I felt oxycodone, I fell in love. When I wake up, when I have lunch, when I come home from work, when I go to sleep I dose myself. And GOD I LOVE IT. This rush, this high is so beatiful I'm heartbroken. I don't care if it's heroin or dilaudid or whatever. I don't agree that heroin is the best opioid ever and such. It doesn't matter. Heroin, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone, hydromorphone. It's all amazing. I love it and I hate it so much.

If I don't have any, I NEED to get it. If I have it, and I always have it, I smile. No pain. No sorrow. Just calm. In peace. And I cry. For many reasons. When I'm fucked up I cry because of the way this shit makes me feel. Amazing. Happy. It's makes me feel great. I cry because I can't stop. I cry because I don't wanna stop. Because I will not stop. I'm sentenced to chase this dragon for the rest of my life. Oh, and I will get him! I grab him by the balls every fucking day, even if this means taking massive amounts of drugs.
