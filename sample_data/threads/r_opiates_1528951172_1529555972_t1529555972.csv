All was good, we set up a time to meet up....until he told me the prices. He said I can get 20 of them for 300 (they usually go for $30 each or more) or $25 each if I buy small amount. It seems too cheap?

I found a dude that middled for me in the hood and it turned out to be üî•üî•üî• but the bags were really small. I knew right off the bat that it was sourced from ODB on the DNMs because it was uncut, grey, and I've had it before from ODB. Plus there's no way that a middle man would be that close to an uncut plug just doesn't happen. 


The middle used my cell phone to call the dude and after witnessing me shoot he told the guy I was straight. So I drove away with my tiny ass lil 40 bag and I got a call from the plug telling me to come straight to him from now on. Sweet! I finally found a plug and it's fire... At least I thought so at that point.


First time I met up with him he had twenty bags all neatly and evenly divided and I got six for 100. He literally called me two hours later to ask if I needed more and I said nah but tomorrow for sure. 

Second time I met him he had neat Lil twenty bags just like before no problem, and just like before he called me to see if I needed more. 

He called or texted me every day sometime twice a day to see if I needed.

Third time we meet I said lemme get another six for 100. We meet up and he hands me one bag and says he just put it all in one bag. It's noticeably smaller than what I should've gotten but whatever it's my new plug I'll let this one slide.


Next time I decide I'm not going to spend more than 40 at a time just to send a subtle hint that I know I was shorted. So the next four days I kept getting 40s and they kept getting smaller and smaller to the point where I was only getting one descent shot for 40 bucks.


Then I'm about fed up but I need more dope so I tells him to bring me 60. He rolls thru and puts this little orange moist ball that looks like something he made in his kitchen from flour and sugar and whatever was laying around. I knew right away it was straight bunk but the junkie in me shot it anyways and obviously no affect whatsoever. I call him up and I'm like wtf did you give me. You and I both know this shit was fake. And he gives me some bullshit story about going thru another plug yadadaaa bullshit. But he says in gonna get you back on your next bag so I say come on thru now and I'll take another bag. 


He rolls they and gives me another shitty 40 that barely gets me high. I paid him $38 cash and $2 in quarters cuz that's all I have on me. He immediately calls me and says he you owe me $30 because that was  a $70 piece and I was like I didn't ask for a $70 piece I asked to be made whole after you gave me this bunk shit. But whatever I guess it's my only plug in my new city in just gonna roll with the punches 


So I pawned a couple computers and came up with $100 and call him up and told him I was tired of getting ripped off and I just want things to be the way they were when we first met. I said I got $130, I'll give you the (bullshit) $30 plus $100 if I could just get six pre weighed twenties like you did for me when we first met. He was surprisingly cool about it and said I got you.


So we go to meet up and he asks if I could give him a ride down the street. I said yes but what I didn't know was that he planned on his two friends getting in my back seat too. 


So we meet and gets in the front seat and his friends hop in the back. I'm immediate like WTF WTF WTF!? O have my keys and my phone and said everyone out the car right now or I'm calling the police.

You guys think I was about to get taken?


After they get out of the car I drive away and he's texting me like hey I got twenties and we need a ride what's up what up. I haven't answered his texts or calls. He kept testing the waters with me, kept seeing what he could get away with. When he surprised me with two people I never met getting in my back seat I thought for sure this is gonna be a stick up.

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the  built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) that's basically it, just don't be a douche.

Facts:

* I went to a Jewish junky who middled for me and got a half. 

* The half tasted like cut that was in his dope once before, but this time it was overwhelming.

* The bag was fat, because it was like mostly or all seasoning.

* The middle's house smells a bit like this seasoning. Smell is linked to memory.

It is a very racist question, I know I'm walking a fine line.

The individual who sold the stuff to me is jewish, their house smells like this seasoning (memory is linked to smell) so that's why I am so specific to implicate the cooking of the culture with the smell of this dope.

I'm going to investigate now by checking my turmeric and comparing. I am disgusted by the possibility that I may snort this whole fucking thing.

I never do talk trash about him and I am well within my goddam right to be speaking ill of him right the fuck now.

Correction: I never did. Now, this is the second time. It's way more seasoning than dope. I gave him the benefit of doubt last time. This time there are no doubts.

It is definitely a Kosher seasoning. In my angst, I did speak precisely what was on my mind when writing this post.

My drug of choice is meth which I would shoot up and eventually a friend told me to try heroin so I did and I started shooting up instantly. I never did very much and would nod off but would never ever get a rush that I was told so much about so one night (around 10 p.m.) after feeling good but no rush I decided to do another shot and see if I could feel any better which I know is stupid but I was pretty depressed at that point in my life so I didn't care. I remember waking up at around midnight drenched in sweat so I moved over to my couch where there's an ac window unit and then promptly passed out. I remember hearing the sound of somebody throwing up and realized it might be me so I thought I should probably go to the bathroom and the next thing I know it's 10 in the morning and my roommate is knocking on the bathroom door asking if he can get in to get ready for class. I think I told him I was sick or something and he just went somewhere else to get ready. I guess I fell asleep after that because then I suddenly woke up and it's 4 in the afternoon. I could taste in my mouth that I had thrown up at some point and I somehow had almost no vomit on my shirt and it's mostly in the toilet but I have no recollection of actually throwing up or anything other than hearing it in the middle of the night.  
So my question is, was this an od or did I do enough to just sleep through everything that was going on? I was always under the impression that an od means you'd stop breathing and would die without medical attention but when I talked to my friend she said I had od'ed and got mad at me for doing as much as I did.",1529535621.0

Packed 8 of my subs for the work week. After receiving my bags from the claims area, I headed to the hotel to find my script was gone. TSA left no note or anything saying they seized my stuff. I called the airport, only to be told they have no record of any seizure of any kind regarding my belongings. Super pissed for the rest of the day, and realizing I need to find something to get me by I figured I would give whisper a try. I've used the app a few times and have had really good luck. after a few hours I got a couple of messages, most of them were people asking what a ""Dboy"" was lol. One message however was a guy who said he could help. I told him I could make the 30 minute drive and would give him $100 for helping me + one sub and a half gram of powder. We talked for a bit over the app and he seemed like a truly nice dude, who knows how it feels to be skewed. So I figured I would go for it. I drove out and met him at a  fuel Mart station in the rougher part of town. He showed me the cig pack with the stuff inside, I could see the sub pill sitting on top. I handed him my money and we headed out separate ways. I waited until I got back to the hotel to check the pack, figured I couldn't do anything anyways now. after taking the sub out, I went for the powder. it was a crushed up aspirin, in some tin foil ): Neddless to say, I spent $100 on one 8mg suboxone.

Is it readily available or difficult to find? I am suffering from really bad anhedonia (not depression though), probably from chronic stress, which means I almost never feel any sort of joy or pleasure. My entire life is falling apart from it since I have certain athletic and career aspirations but I have almost no motivation to do anything and it is really hard and stressful to force myself. It's been like this for almost 4 years now and I've tried so many antidepressants and nothing helped. I had elbow surgery done a few months ago and I was prescribed a decent amount of 2mg Dilaudid. It ended up changing my life since for the first time I was able to feel pleasure, excitement, joy, as well as motivation to do things. The pain passed fairly quickly but I continued to use it recreationally, but very carefully, only once a week as I was aware of the risk. The few hours that I would be high were like a literal vacation, a break from feeling like a complete zombie. Unfortunately I ran out a month and a half ago and my anhedonia is getting worse and worse and it feels like my life is completely falling apart. I can hardly get myself to leave for work on time and I am at risk of getting fired, not to mention that my grades were ruined because of it. I've also tried tramadol (had to CWE tramacet) and T3's but those did almost nothing. I've never bought drugs, not even pot, off of the street and don't know how to do it. If there were some dillies to buy, what is the likelihood that they are fakes containing fentanyl? Would I be able to use test strips? Also, would it be worth it to get a Narcan nasal spray? I am not a junkie type of person at all, I am a busy student who volunteers a lot and is currently employed as a pharmacy assistant and I deal with methadone patients a lot, so I know of the risks. The thing is, even though I would be extremely careful to avoid dependency, I would rather have problems with addiction and achieve some success rather than achieve absolutely nothing (which is where I'm headed) and still be anhedonic.

Also: I have residual nerve pain as a result of the surgery that gets pretty bad after workouts even though my elbow itself healed perfectly. Is it worth it to try asking a doctor for pills? They will probably just say to take stupid Tylenol or give me some more bullshit tramacet or T3's or gabapentin",1529533333.0

I wasn‚Äôt exactly clean before that, I was abusing codeine and tramadol for 6 years up until I went to the clinic a few months ago. They gave me subuxone as opposed to subutex which worked a treat last time. That stuff drives me nuts, my doc went on holiday for two months, I‚Äôve only been in this country for a year and they‚Äôre super strict with prescription meds so I went out and scored some gear because subuxone can go die a miserable death in hell. Doc is back Friday. 

Anyway, I was reading the top posts from the last month and read the post about the airline pilot dude who nearly got busted by security for wrapping his drugs in foil. Made me realise I‚Äôm not the only pilot out there who uses. I‚Äôm not an airline pilot, and I‚Äôm in a very different field, a much more dangerous one and am quite well known in that field but I don‚Äôt carry passengers. I never flew while high. Was taking two large doses of codeine twice a day. Never flew while I was riding out the high (I would drive to the airport though). It didn‚Äôt impair me, just gave me an almost hour long buzz. 

Do we have any more of you on here? A lot of my pilot buddies do use drugs quite lot, mostly coke, a lot of coke and I have one other pilot buddy who I know uses opiates recreationally and he‚Äôs the only one who knows I do. Starting to wonder if it is my friend in fact now... aviation is small. 

What are your guys views on that? Would you feel safe knowing that one of your airline pilots, flight instructors, airshow pilots were using opiates. Those three specifically because they risk other people‚Äôs lives as well. I always thought that if I had a major crash and survived, I‚Äôd be tested and fucked for life in terms of my flying career.

Fent gives you a decent rush, but there‚Äôs none of that typical opiate energy involved where you feel like you‚Äôre on speed (a phenomenon I‚Äôve noticed with heavy opiate users as what draws us to them, instead of working like a depressant the complete drop in inhibition, massive bump in motivation, and overall increase of energy makes it feel more like speed - whereas when I get really good ice (smoked) it‚Äôs a very euphoric, clear, but ‚Äúslow‚Äù high...where time slows down but I‚Äôm not about the clean the kitchen like I am on opiates). I bet everyone is different here but, anecdotally, I know I am not alone.

High quality dope gives a very specific type of rush...that histamine response which leads to pins and needles (and honestly is where I reach my ceiling as anymore and the pins and needles become uncomfortable - for me that‚Äôs around 4 bags of high quality ECP (stuff around New York - don‚Äôt think saying an area that is hundreds of square miles and contains well over 10 million people qualifies as sources...though let me know if if does and I‚Äôll remove immediately).

We all know that fent has little to no legs compared to dope, but the biggest thing I notice is that subsequent doses...for me about 4-6 hours later...another shot of dope equal to my first shot I actually get a nice rush.  Nothing like the rush from being sick to high, but it‚Äôs pronounced and there.  Whereas fent does not exhibit this...it‚Äôs almost like a waste when your redosd and I try wait until I‚Äôm not feeling perfect well I get any rush at all, but my addict brain generally doesn‚Äôt allow that.

In short, I can make an equal amount (2 buns) of good dope last twice as long as 2 buns of fent.

I should start volumetric dosing my heroin nasally to reduce the hotspot risk.

Is volumetric dosed fent more dangerous than snorting powder heroin? I don't try to get very high, so I'm not inclined to intentionally push the limit on safe dosing... I'm just taking enough to feel decent when I dose. I'm considering switching from h to furanyl fentanyl since it's much cheaper. 

Are there risks that I'm missing in my thinking?  I thought the two big risks of fentanyl are when doing powder (risky eyeballing instead of volumetric dosing) and also when doing intentionally high doses because the euphoria is weak so people take too much to try to get euphoria?

So, 5 years ago I met this girl that I really got along with. We were super similar, two peas in a pod. Inseparable, spent all our time together and had nothing but fun and easy living. 

I come from a middle class family, w strong family ties. She has a meth fueled biker army as a family and I never held it against her and was always on good terms with them. 

Jump forward 2 years and she started wanting to do tar with me. I obliged. We got on the ride to disasterville, and before I knew it we were deep into fentalogs. It didn't affect me negatively, but she was declining health wise and mind wise all the time more and more. 

After 3 years and constantly being attentive to her over doses trying to monitor her breathing 24:7, have narcane handy and keep a good grip mentally on cpr, I finally had to lock up the dope in my gunsafe because she'd be stealing from my stash when I finally got sleep. 

This worked for a while but not long. Finally the sleep deprivation took its toll on me, and I slept until 12:30pm on one faithful Easter. 

I woke up to find her blue on the floor, completely cold w my gunsafe pried open and foil in her death grip and a tooter in her hair. 

My father and I tried our best to revive her to no avail. Had to call the ambulance. Again. This time was the third time in 2 months I had to call for her. And this time they all knew us by name and what the issue was. 

To make a long story short, she's alive and ""well"" but has suffered serious nervous system damage in her brain. It's almost like a stroke ( I think) it affects her motor skills and speech severely. 

So we no longer live together at this point because I'm kicking tetrahydro fu-f cold turkey and it was a bitch. So I couldn't physically care for an invalid whether I wanted to or not. And I did, very much. 

So she moved in with the meth fueled biker army, and they do alright to take care of her in all honesty. As good as a tweaker can I suppose. 

So I see her about once a week, because I hate going to the mobile home she's at due to the violence against white people there I am not exactly welcome you could say. Nonetheless, I make sure to speak with her often and see her when I can.

Now we're all caught up till about last week. 

She invites me over to meet her gay friend of 10 years, and I agree. He's annoying as hell but I ignore him and am just happy to spend time with my lady. But when I arrived the pair was wasted drunk, and since I was there her gma (let's call her D) puts me in charge of the mobile home while she is gone. I accept. Then her and her friend decide to steal Ds meth, and I don't put up a fuss about it. It's hard to understand her as it is, then add the liquor to the stroke jargon it's truly impossible for me to grasp anything she says the first few times. 

So we all get high and have a nice night overall. 10pm comes along and I leave after making sure she was tucked into bed. 

The next morning I wake up to my phone being blown the fuck up by D, and she tells me my lady's gay friend said I broke her Windows in to steal her meth and eveything that happened to her granddaughter is my fault. Like I put a gun to her head and made her steal my drugs just to flip my life upside down. 

I'm not happy about this, and we get into a serious argument over the phone. It doesn't go well. I end up deciding that war with the biker army isn't worth the trouble considering my lady is not the same person at all since the od. She acts like a 12yo, always sarcastic and rude. Always bitchy. So I tell her I love her more than the moon and stars but she really put me between a rock and a hard place. 

Now, we're at today. Up until today for the past week I have kept in contact with her for fear of her doing something awful to herself (suicide in some manner). But today she hits me up and sends me a bunch of pictures of this dude she wants to fuck and how much he loves her and blahblahblah. 

I was very offended by this. I always treated her well, and that's something I haven't been keen on as far women go in my past. 

The disrespect is fucking me up rn. 

So I wish her the best and tell her I'll always love her but I cannot be her friend anymore it's just too hard. 

I feel like I dodged the biggest bullet in my life and yet it still hurts like a son of bitch. 

Sorry this is so God Damn long. 

I don't expect this to be well received I just dont know where else to go and I figured this was relatable to this sub.

8se9mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8se9mb/so_after_12_years_of_daily_opiate_abuse_and/,12,https://redd.it/8se9mb,SpeakingHonestly,"So after 12 years of daily opiate [ab]use, and having withdrawn from dope and literally every opiate prescribed to man (more times than I could count), I had my first experience with precipitated withdrawals yesterday. Story/Timeline inside.","**SPOILER**: it's *un*chill

**5:45AM** - Feeling groggy and nauseated, joint pain amplified, I get up to pee and see my pupils dilated as fuck. I realize I've got just over an hour and a half before work, I half-asleep decide that that's a safe enough window and fumble for the loose suboxone films in my 7-day pill organizer. I stick 2 under my tongue and drift back off for a few minutes

**5:50AM** - The chemical-orange taste of the suboxone dissolving wakes me up again, and as I realize they're about 70% dissolved, my eyes fucking JOLT open and my heart literally palpitates/skips a beat

*""wait. NO. oh my god.* **OH MY FUCKING GOD**. *my foot isn't even tapping. i'm not even into the cold sweats‚Äîi'm probably still 6-7 hours from clean receptors.. what did I just do?""*

**6:10AM** - Pacing around and trying to convince myself that I had been sicker than I really was prior to dosing the subs, and that PWD wouldn't hit me (and if it did, it wouldn't be too hard and it would be over in time for work).

**6:25AM** - Pins and needles in my arms and legs, thin film of sweat manifests over my upper body, I lay down and throw a blanket over myself

**6:45AM** - I'm well and truly fucked. I postpone texting my boss and think back to some of these shitty stupid reddit posts I've read in the past about how PWD is more intense but only lasts an hour or so. At this point I'm still ignorantly planning/expecting to make it into work‚Äîif only feeling shitty and having to hide it.

**7:45AM** - Should have left for work 20 minutes ago, but can't get off the couch. My heart is racing, my skin is burning, I redose suboxone since I have no dope left or other opiates to take the edge off. I know the only way out is through. I text my boss that I'm sick.

The next 3 hours are spent rolling around in a restless sweaty haze. Tossing sheets off of me, and pulling them back on‚Äîreplacing my knee pillow maybe 30 times (fucking thing has a life of its own). I become lucid/present again at around 11:00AM and realize I'm through the worst of it, but I still feel like this:

I take the rest of the afternoon to rest and recoup and think about what I did and why I'm a shitbird.

Hey y‚Äôall, hope your tuesdays goin alright. So my friend had a bit of an overdose over Memorial Day weekend, and I kinda sorta did the same thing in the same spot a couple days later. Paramedics were involved both times, not my first rodeo, never fun of course. I‚Äôve had a few similar situations in the past and I‚Äôve never had to pay for the narcan or the ambulance or the hospital or anything. Neither of us even went to an ambulance either time, but we still received ‚Äúcare‚Äù I guess, briefly. 

My homie got a bill, though, at his folks place in another state, for this incident. Apparently they‚Äôre saying he needs to pay a ‚ÄúFirst Responder Fee‚Äù. We‚Äôve been trying to learn what we can about it without much luck, so I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has experience with/knowledge about this. I haven‚Äôt got a bill (yet), really hoping I don‚Äôt get one, but I‚Äôm not feelin too hopeful there. Apparently him not being a California resident might have something to do with it, not sure how they‚Äôd pull that up though. 

I‚Äôve OD‚Äôd and been taken to the hospital in an ambulance and I even think I received a sort of bill for that at one point with like $0 owed somehow. I got surrounded by cops with guns and forced to go to the hospital in an ambulance last year, and I never had to pay for any of that either. Apparently these fees are a city thing though, so none of that necessarily means anything in this case. I can‚Äôt even find any info on this city actually charging these fees but homie got the bill from a collection agency already so, like, I guess they do.

Luckily it seems like it won‚Äôt be anything crazy, like $150 or something. That‚Äôll be pretty hard for me to swing in my current position but it‚Äôs doable. Really not sure what I‚Äôm gonna do if it‚Äôs like $500, my mom would def bail my ass out luckily but I really don‚Äôt wanna have to tell her her son (who‚Äôs supposedly clean on subs too fml) fuckin overdosed. Managed to hide all the others from her üòë she doesn‚Äôt deserve to have to worry about that shit, she worries enough as it is.

Supposedly it may be possible to get these fees waived somehow as well, so I‚Äôm holding onto some hope there if I do get hit with this bill. 


Thanks so much in advance anyone that can help me out here at all. Can‚Äôt find a whole lot of info on this and I know I just gotta deal with whatever comes my way here, it‚Äôs my damn fault anyway. Just hoping I guess that someone can tell me something good here!

Caffeine is by far THE most common cut in #3, this is because it makes it easier to chase the dragon on foil. So I was wondering if when you then smoke it off of the foil, does the caffeine enter your system as well?

I ask this as I'm high right now and this is one of those highs where I have a lot of energy and I feel really productive, I've smoked a lot and sometimes, depending on what I get, it's very sedating and sometimes it's much more energising.

I know for a fact that caffeine is added to #3 so my line of thinking is that those more energetic highs are from where there's a higher caffeine content and the more sedating ones are where there's a lower caffeine content.

I'm sure in America you guys get your stuff cut with something. Do you ever notice the cuts in your highs?

Is it possible that when I'm vaporising/smoking my H, I'm also doing the same to the caffeine it's been cut with, thus giving me a caffeine high(as much as you can call caffeine a high) as well?

I looked it up and normal bic lighters can reach up to 800  degrees Celsius, though normally they float around 300-400. The vaporisation temperature of caffeine is about 200 degrees, so surely it's possible?thoughts?

EDIT: Have any of you Americans felt a difference in high which you believe to be due to a cut?

EDIT 2: This is what made me think about it - the key thing that shows you have good H is when you run it on the foil there's no residue indicating little to no cuts that can't be  vaporised, and if there's no residue, then what happens to the cuts like caffeine?",1529439476.0

8sbjhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8sbjhm/epiphany/,3,https://redd.it/8sbjhm,kev647,Epiphany,"I was just messaging a fellow subreddit poster here and as I was sharing my input on their recent decision to get clean when I just realized something huge.  We all know that part of the biggest problem with opiate addiction is that the bad effects of withdrawals don't really appear until a while after your dose - 8-12 hours or so.  BUT, when you administer your favorite opiate while you are sick in the middle of withdrawal, you are immediately healed and your body builds a bond that see's the thing that got you sick initially as the cure, the antidote.  It doesn't have the ability to actually, at a subconscious level, associate the drugs with the sickness.  Great.  But did you ever wonder why when you are relapsing on your opiates, that the effects are not as desirable or as fun?  How many times have you relapsed when you were out of the woods with opiates only to go, ""that wasn't that great..."" and then you are back into your old habits. 

Well I think I figured out why.  When you are sick, the feeling of going from completely miserable to healed and then to high is a huge jump for us.  However, if we are already clean, that jump isn't as noticeable and doesn't seem that big.  That relief while being sick feels huge.

So let me say, Hello my friends. I hope you are all good and well. Sorry for the wall of text in advance. There's a tl;dr at the bottom.

I've recently decided to get my life together and quit my addictions. So about two months ago I quit taking benzos and have been on maintenance for my opiates. The road hasn't been easy but I feel like I've come a long way. As of right now, I really have no withdrawal symptoms but over the time I've been off everything, I've developed a noticable tremor. Mainly in my hands and its gotten to a point that it's starting to affect certain aspects of my life. Even just typing this out on my phone is a little difficult. Thank god for auto-correct, right? Another thing is that tremors actually run in my family. (There's a specific name for it but I don't want to be identified) My grandfather had them and passed it on to my father. The thing is though, in most cases they don't become evident until your 40's, which is still a ways a way for me. But it technically can develop at any age. My question is do you think this may be some kind of withdrawal? I mean, other than the tremors though, I'm fine. Or do you think I may have an early onset of the disorder. Maybe activated somehow through my drug use? The main thing that's strange is how it progressed after I quit. I mean, since my late teen years I would get a slight tremor from drinking even the smallest amount of coffee or when I was really tired but before this I can't say I ever really noticed much. I know 99% of you have no idea about genetic disorders so I'm mainly asking about your experience with benzodiazepines and/or opiate withdrawal and their link to tremors. Any personal experience would be greatly appreciated.

Tl;dr Have you ever had tremors from benzo and/or opiate withdrawal. When did it start. When did it end. I know there's a lot of variables but anything you could tell me would help.",1529432766.0

And of our friend circle im the guy everyone goes to if they want advice on drugs. we are all 19-23 in our friend circle. Pretty much all of my friends play video games and have there money saved and they all just fuck with weed. Im the person without the gaming console i sold it and i kind of have zero dollars saved up. 8:00 am i get woke up by bendernod. I think to myself he never calls this ealy so i answer.

bendernod ""did i wake you up""

me (sizzle)- "" yeah your good just tell me whats  cracking""

bendernod ""i was up all night in *locatiom removed* @heroin el chapo basketball nodding court of drugs** with these hoes dopefiends and dealers had a good night on coke and spent about $250 on just coke and one of the hoes shoots heroin into her arm with a needle. shortly after i asked  if i could buy some! She (kayla)-""yeah baby um here!"" she breaks out some black tar. i asked kayla if she i need to crush it up good because im gonna snort it"" kayla replied calmly yes and she procedded to light up some crack. so sizzle i snorted some and i was feeling real good but it was just a tease. asked Kayla for another bump she said do u have money im out. i gave her $85 and she used my phone and 4am and the dealer came and only kayla met her plug and by 5am i had some heroin. i put it on my scale on top of a $20 bill it weighed .1 so i figured she ripped me of and this would hardly get me high so i went home and  it was 6 am by now. i showerd and ate and laid in bed and figured 8 am was good enough to call you. can i come over""

sizzle- ""yeah pull up gang""

bendernod got here about 2 hours ago and showed me the heroin. reddit gang i believe my friend bought fentanyl!!  after getting the solid like heroin chunk out of the bag. it was pure white!

i explained thats fentanyl and its a good thing he showed up here so i could show him how to use it.

the whole white chunk did weigh 100mg after weighing on my scale to. 

I break bendernod of 6mg bump of this fentanyl and he snorts it up.5 minutes later bendernod feels very good he told me and gets all happy and thanks me explaining how lucky he is to have a kind friend like me and he offers me a bump. i do 12mg because i been doing east coast heroin the past week. and he does 4mg more and he starts nodding.

im glad bendernod had a good time he is still here and it was his idea for me to use reddit. if u want to ask us anything fire away we are gonna watch tv and try and get high. he is on my phone all the time because i trust him. 

questions from me and bendernod. if the reddit gang has a minute to help us out that would me nodsome!! <nod+ awesome> lol

we like any type of music. anyone have a youtube playlist they wanna share?

we have no job so we want to save as much heroin as possible. any tips. bendernod said the dealer told him to take a 20mg bump and lay down flat on back with head up quickly right after snorting a tiny bit for 30 minutes! dealer claims this will save money and promises it will seriously get us very very high if we snort h and lay down on back for 30.

thats pretty much it. we just wanna know if snorting small bumps and laying on back for 30 minutes will get us really high like the dealer saiid!

me and bendernod thank u for reading happy nods and stay high stay positive. throw out the hate and become great. stay safee

This is from about 5 years ago.

Now, I used to have a ""friend"" named Kevin. I know it's a meme to hate on people named Kevin, but I really didn't care for this dude, and his name really is Kevin. I still hung out with him though because his mom gave him her script of K-pins and he was an alcoholic so he would share all his shitty vodka with me. When we hung out I was basically also an alcoholic. I'd occasionally have some pills or dope or something and sometimes his neighbor would sell us random opiates. It was a friendship made solely for getting completely shit faced together.

One night we were getting wasted and popping some K-pins, as usual. There may or may not have been opiates, I can't really remember; the benzos made most of these nights pretty hazy. I'm not sure exactly why we went, but we ended up going to Wal-Mart at 4am. So, I drove there completely wrecked, but surprisingly i drove fairly well from what I can recall. Luckily the store was only a 10 minute drive from Kevin's house.

We were walking through the store and I had a razor blade in my pocket for cutting up dope/oxy. This was right around the time I started banging and I know I definitely didn't have needles that night. Well, when I'm on benzos I have zero inhibitions, so I impulsively started slashing all the bicycle tires in the toy section, obviously. After I had rendered a few flat I fucked up and accidentally sliced open the palm of my hand. I started bleeding everywhere.

I immediately walked to the pharmacy, leaving a trail of blood behind like Hansel and Gretel's breadcrumbs. When I got there I opened up a pack of bandages and some medical tape then bandaged myself up to stop the bleeding. I think I just threw the opened packages on the floor and walked away.

I knew we should probably leave after that so I swung by electronics and pocketed a spool of 100 blank DVDs, for some reason. I didn't even burn DVDs anymore, instead opting to use my laptop as a media server to stream all my movies to my PS3 (now PS4). But if I'm in a store and on benzos I'm going to steal something, no matter how pointless.

We got the hell out of there and I drove back home at 5am as school buses were taking all the kids to school. We made it back safe somehow and continued drinking. I still have no idea how I didn't get arrested and I have no fucking clue why I went to Wal-Mart in the first place.

I have to wonder though what they did when they saw the blood all over the store. Of course they cleaned it up, but surely someone would have checked the security tapes, right? Oh well, just another story on my list of why I no longer take benzos recreationally. Come to think of it, i don't really drink anymore either.

Can't explain it really. I guess it's just that everyone loves their morning rituals; Normies love their morning coffee/tea whereas we love morning dope. It's just an amazing start for the day: shower first so veins come out better, poke yourself, red plume, and take-off!


Also, yes it's shitty to use when on maintenance. In my defense though, I hardly ever do it and I'm not nearly as bad as most other folks at my doctor's. If you think nobody uses drugs when they're on maintenance, you're almost cute in your naivet√©.

My girlfriend had never done opioids. Then, this past weekend, she got her hands on Percocet, and she's never really done drugs. It wasn't out of being stuck up or some weird backwards view on it, she was just never really interested, and was fine with her occasional drink. She's smoked weed twice I think, and didn't like it that much.

Little background on her, she's depressed, and is diagnosed with a few anxiety disorders, one of them is OCD. I was scared of her ever trying opes because I had a feeling she'd like em way too much. More than me. Anywho, she told me she wanted to take these percs, and I even had a strong gut urge to stay away from them. I didn't want her to do them either, I didn't want the withdrawal for her, I didn't want the fiending, and turns out, this would be the third day in a row of her doing them, she just wanted to do them with me. She promised not to do them ever again afterwards, and I figured that, what the hell, its 15mg of oxycodone, last time, she doesn't have access to more, whatever, and I've fought off the fiending before, I'll do it again to be on her level.

This was my fault and my mistake. I cut her lines. I taught her how to snort it. Turns out, she was planning to take her life after I left, and this was kind of on her bucket list. She didn't because I stayed longer than I had planned, and she couldn't do it.

I feel as though if she had never met me, she would've never even known what an opioid was, or how to do it, or what it did. I feel fucking awful. I don't know what to do. I've been lurking this sub for a while, and you guys have always seemed supportive of each other. I know I'm a dumbass, I know I fucked her up, I know I shouldn't have done it. But I did it all anyways. How do I stop? Does this fiending shit ever end? How do I help her?

I'm sorry if this shit is really soft bullshit and I'm just overreacting, I just wanted the story out there somewhere ya know?

TLDR: Gf takes Percocet, almost kills herself, I taught her how to do the drugs

I've suffered from treatment-resistant depression for over half of my life. (I'm 30 years old.) Since I was 24, I've taken many different anti-depressants including nearly all the SSRIs, SNRIs, Remeron (mirtazipine), Wellbutrin, pramipexole, and even an MAOI, Nardil (phenelzine). None of these worked. I stuck with 30mg of Remeron because it at least helped me sleep.

I had my wisdom teeth removed at 25. My dentist gave me a prescription for Percocet. This totally eliminated my depression and anxiety. I knew about the risks of addiction, but I quickly ran out of the Percs before any physical or mental addiction was able to take hold.

I started using a small amount of kratom to aid in the withdrawal from Percocets that I was on for 9 months. Then, sure enough, I found an excuse to use kratom all the time. After a year of it, I quit it cold turkey and the withdrawal was almost as difficult.

So now I'm clean and have been for months. I don't drink alcohol or any sugary drinks. I don't smoke. I exercise a lot. I get some sunlight every day. I eat well (lots of salads, nuts & seeds, chicken, and fish). I take all of the recommended supplements, including tyrosine in the morning, a good multivitamin, niacin, vitamin d, biotin, 5-HTP & GABA, LOTS of high EPA fish oil, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin at night, but I'm still depressed, anxious, and deeply anhedonic. The anhedonia in particular is killing me - nothing seems interesting to me. I know that it takes months to feel better after drug abuse, but it has already been several months and I'm not feeling any better.

So now I'm at a difficult crossroad. I started to read articles about ""Reward Deficiency Syndrome"" and think that I and many other people who don't respond to traditional antidepressants may have it. Here's a link to a good Psychology Today article explaining what this is: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/addicted-brains/201308/when-the-thrill-is-gone-reward-deficiency-syndrome

Even though the theory still needs to be worked out, the basic idea is that, for whatever reason, my brain simply doesn't have enough dopamine D2 receptors, and, because of this, I have to supplement my brain with extra dopaminergic/endorphin-boosting drugs just in order to feel normal, otherwise nothing is enjoyable to me and is not worth pursuing. This might be why normal antidepressants just don't work on me. My issue isn't with serotonin or norepinephrine or even dopamine. My brain's reward system is just messed up.

I talked about this with my psychiatrist about this and, considering that I've been through every class of antidepressant medication, she is seriously considering putting me on an ultra low dose of Suboxone (buprenorphine/naloxone), even though this is controversial in psychiatry. When I say ultra low dose, I mean .5mg of Suboxone. The smallest dose of Suboxone they make is 2mg; I'd have to cut the already tiny sublingual Suboxone strip into even smaller quarters.

My psychiatrist knows about my past substance use and she is understandably very hesitant, as am I. I asked my psychiatrist if perhaps I should microdose with kratom instead and she said that while she might be supportive of the idea, kratom is likely different from batch to batch and that I might not know how to dose. With Suboxone, I'll be able to to titrate where, with kratom, I'll have a much more difficult time. So now I appeal to you guys to see what you think.

Should I take the ultra low dose Suboxone (.5mg) or should I microdose with kratom (from .25g to 1g)? Or should I do something else entirely?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! :)",1529378837.0

Everybody hates not getting as high as desired... where he wanted to be. Especially, when the reason isn‚Äòt the lack of the substances you want to get into your bloodstream, but more likely to the naloxone  Pharma companies added to your favourite snacks. 
 
Yes, i‚Äòm talking about naloxone. Here is my thought on how to ‚Äûkind of‚Äú get to some kind of solution

I recently thought a lot about reducing, not quite eleminating the Nalaxon from combined medications like the well known Products containing Oxycodone and Naloxone and a relatively unknown one, since it‚Äôs more common in Germany and Belgium only - Tilidin/naloxone

As far as my research took me, oxycodone  and Tilidin are easily soluable in ethanol, while naloxone only slightly is. 
So using a quite similar way as people use to wash stuff with acetone out of their speed, it should at least be a way to significantly decrease the amount of Naloxone that was inside the perfectly crushed tablets before. 
It‚Äòs similar to caffeine. It‚Äòs poorly soluble in acetone, so most, but not all of it is gone after the cleaning of it 

Since naloxone becomes orally active when taken 25-35mg , that would be quite handy. 
Dosage Oxy (Targin 20/10) now is 50, to be on the safe site with the naloxone . 
Since I have a tolerance, it  does nothing for me. 
When it comes to the max. Dosage of 350-400mg  Tilidin (Extended but crushed and parachuted) due to the 28-32 mg naloxone  contained, I can‚Äôt just take more. 
First pass metabolism kills most of the naloxone orally since 97-99% won‚Äôt get into your bloodstream. 
But at 25-35 mg most people feel the rush to weaken and when reaching 35/40mg Naloxone or more, most people instantly feel plain sober. 
So here is what I found so far.., 

Solubility of oxy 

‚ÄûNearly insol in ether, water, potassium and sodium hydroxid. 

Insoluble in water; soluble in ethanol, chloroform
[Lide, D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 86TH Edition 2005-2006. CRC Press, Taylor & Francis, Boca Raton, FL 2005, p. 3-410] **PEER REVIEWED**‚Äú

Solubility of tilidine: 

Physicochemistry
It usually comes in its hydrochloride hemihydrate salt form; in this form it is highly soluble in water, ethanol and dichloromethane and appears as a white/almost white crystalline powder.[3] Its storage is restricted by its insensitivity to light and sensitivity to degradation by oxygen, hence necessitating its storage in amber bottles and at temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, respectively.[1][3]


And finally naloxone : 

Water Solubility Soluble in water (73 mg/ml), ethanol (3.3 mg/ml), methanol (50 mg/ml) and dimethyl sulfoxide (73 mg/ml). Insoluble in ether

My question is, how realistic my thought of just reducing the naloxone in the formula simply by using a small but not too tiny amount of ethanol  to solve the Tilidin or oxy in it while just some of the naloxone will be solved in it, run it through a coffee Filter and let it dry. 
Maybe repeat once or twice. 

Besides, I assume the ethanol should be as dry as it has to be when it comes to washing amphetamines with dry acetone, right? Same procedure to dry it? 

I won‚Äôt get rid of all the naloxone, but even half of it would allow me to double my dose, so I can actually get the nice active Rush from the Tilidin or make use of all the 20/10 oxy/naloxone that are widely available in my area,  means I‚Äòm aware there won‚Äôt be snorting or anything else. Just the good ol‚Äò swallowing pils 

Thanks if you read until now.

So it all started a few years ago. It began with a prescription of clonazepam. I realized that I could have fun if I took a few more than prescribed.

Then I realized if i smoke some weed while high on clonazepam it was really fun. 

~Fast forward through the psychedelic experimentation phase~ 

It didn‚Äôt take long for me to get my hands on hydrocodone. I had heard and read about the high, and I decided I wanted to try it. So I downed a few 5/325 hydros and I was on top of the world. I had no real connect to get pills from, so hydros were a rare but welcomed commodity. But I loved the way they felt. It was the one drug that I didn‚Äôt need to also have weed to enjoy. 

I continued to mostly smoke weed, and occasionally try other substances, mdma, shrooms, Xanax, you name it. 

One day I make friend with these two guys. Well call them Fred, and Robert. Fred was a pretty straight edge guy. Had smoked weed, done acid once, nothing crazy. Robert on the other hand had two brothers who sold cocaine up in the city that we lived near. So he had a bit more experience. Well once I became good friends with these guys, I decided I wanted to try coke. So we drove up to his brothers place and had a badass coke fueled night. 

Well, these brothers sold cocaine, but they also enjoyed heroin. They didn‚Äôt do it often, and didn‚Äôt seem like junkies, but they had access to it, and like a dumbass I decided I wanted to try it.

Where I lived the highest purity shit on the streets was tar. The lower purity shit was gunpowder, basically a tiny bit of tar that was mixed with a shit load of inert powder. So I started with monkey water, snorted it, felt the heroin, but it wasn‚Äôt all that amazing. I tried it a couple times after this, also snorting, and I got really high, but didn‚Äôt see how it was so amazing and addictive..

It was all fun and games until the day I decided to buy a fresh pack of syringes from the Walmart pharmacy. Biggest mistake I ever made. That night me and Robert went up to his brothers. We got some decent quality H, not the best, but strong enough for naive dumbasses like me. So I get one of the brothers to help me shoot up, took a second for him to find my vein, but he did find it. 

I watched as the needle entered my arm, I watched as the dark red blood was registered within, and I watched as the semi-clear, dark brown liquid slowly entered my vein, and suddenly I was in heaven. It took maybe about 30 seconds before I was so fucked up I thought I was going to die. I threw my guts up, but at the same time it was the best fucking high of my entire life. I will never reach that level of ecstasy ever again in my life. It was amazing, and I was hooked... 

I will write about my story in more detail if you guys are interested, I just wanted to share some of it.

Started doing Tramadols and Tapentadols, but have fully reverted back to heroin after only one month. I started to see flashbacks of my life before getting clean last summer, and it scared me shitless. 

My girlfriend(19F) of 7 months knew about my addiction when we started dating, but I had been a couple months clean when we got together, and she has been so supportive of me and believes I am a strong person for admitting my struggles and not pitying myself. I just told her I have been hiding my relapse from her, and we had an emotional last night, but it was out of care for each other, not anger. She promised me she will always be there for me, as long as I trust her enough to tell her anything.

I decided to fix my addiction temporarily because I am swamped with full time work and online classes. Went to a methadone clinic for the first time ever and got a 40mg dose. I feel happy and motivated, but fuck me this methadone feels like a long acting heroin peak. I feel like I enoy this stuff a little too much, but this will only be a temporary fix until I can clear my schedule for outpatient support. 

My girlfriend and I will go to NA meetings every Wednesday, start going back to church, and she is going to stop doing drugs along with me(she does alcohol valium and hexen occasionally). It's always a big help when you can work with someone through an addiction phase. The MMP(Methadone Maintenance Program) has alleviated any cravings for pain, but I feel like this could become my new dope habit if I stay on it for too long, so I am going to keep doing this program for only 4 months, enough to get me to have more free time to go to a treatment program and taper the methadone. Maybe I don't even need to go if the program is successful in stability, then tapering.

This is my first time doing methadone programs. Does anyone have any warnings about this stuff? I know there is a lot of negative stigma and unwarranted suspicion about methadone, but it is still an opiate, so the stigma has some truth to it possibly. I don;t want to be a lifetime methadone addict if possible.",1529344582.0

All in all, I think it was a necessary experience. It made me feel like the best version of myself - confident, anarchistic, laid back, and in a constant state of relief. 

But it also brought me down to my knees - luckily I wasn‚Äôt doing it for long or else I think personally it‚Äôd be inevitable that I‚Äôd end up in jail or OD‚Äôd. It was just too sweet, there‚Äôs not much I wouldn‚Äôt have done for that fix.

Yesterday I threw always my relaspe stash of 2 press Roxie's and half of yellow opana because I knew I didn't think I was going to this time and it felt like that little league home run I never hit. 
Everytime I have tried to stop I always kept some for when I knew I would ''need'' it. Stupid I know.

I have fallen into a phenibut, baclofen, gaba, Xanax and wine person ever since I have quit taking opiates. Being completely sober isn't what I want in life right now but that is a pretty good combo to still be functional as long as the Xanax dose isnt above 2mg. Of course none of this is healthy to take all at once but that isn't what I'm going for and that wasn't the main reason I quit taking opates. I'm just trying to get threw life a little less high. Life may be more hazy but I'm less high for sure. The plan is the slowly get off these substances and maybe lower the Xanax and wine usage some.
 
Everything is fent or really expensive if it's real in NW Florida and it's bullshit doing 3 pharma 30s and not getting well from them because of the fake roxy habbit. I've never really done dope consistently because I hate going threw people to get shit and alot of our shit looks like grey and is so inconsistent sometimes you need narcan, sometimes you can snort a half gram and be sick. I'm sure it's just the junkies I know the their dope is shit and presses blow it out of the water. 
But...

What is your favorite non-opiate related med?
What do you use daily?

Also do you find it hard to not take opiates while not being sober from other substances or easier because at least you are doing something?

And will the using dreams ever stop? Fuck.. almost every dream I find a huge bag of assorted pills but I can never do them or break them down or anything before I wake up. That shit is stressful. 

I also am interested in tianeptine because I have a fucked up arm and I can't really grip or lift anything over 15lbs and the amount of nsaids im taking with the wine is destroying my ulcer and chrons disease which I never noticed really before like I do now. Using wine as a pain killer isn't really working as well as I hoped.   I know tianeptine is technically an antidepressant but it also apparently kills pain slightly and that's all I'm looking for. I also don't know if taking this will make me crave opiates more than I already do. Part of me thinks I shouldn't add anything to the gaba mixture. 

I tired to talk to a sub Dr almost a month ago and since I wasn't using at the time and was 4 days clean I didn't qualify. I was told this program since it is on the cheaper side only takes people in withdrawals or using so that is out of the question as of right now. 

Part of me want to go back to my old Dr and get the 90 15mg oxys back but i know they will only last 4 or 5 days and I'll be right back where I was a month ago. 

Trying to not take opiates while physically fucked is tough and I know it will be extremely metally tough if I tried it sober.

I feel for myself- whenever I use opiates my mind is clear and I can focus a lot better on the task at hand. Whenever I‚Äôm sober, of course I have the same capabilities, but I find myself struggling to focus on what is currently in front of me.

I‚Äôve tried Adderall and other adhd medications but I‚Äôve had no luck with them. Whenever I‚Äôm on opiates I can get shit done; tedious tasks where I‚Äôd otherwise lack motivation to complete. I understand I could most likely train myself to achieve this same level of productivity without the opiates but I‚Äôve found they really aid me in doing so.

My job is extremely boring, without giving out tmi, the people I work with are on avg 30 years older than me and they tell me I‚Äôm literally the youngest man in the city doing what I do. I‚Äôve stayed high throughout the entirety of my employment here and I‚Äôve discovered that the few times I‚Äôve sobered up my productivity has hit a steep decline.

I may no be using the right words to describe exactly what I mean but does anyone understand what I‚Äôm saying or feel the same way?


EDIT: despite popular opinion I feel the need to clarify to you all that I am not saying this to brag. I was looking to see if anyone here felt the same. When I‚Äôm sober I feel alone. I‚Äôm 27 years old and I‚Äôm reaching my mental prime. I feel so fucking aware of everything when I‚Äôm sober; sometimes paralyzed with the anxiety from everything that I see.

I reacted out of anger that everyone was attacking me. I‚Äôm not fucking saying this shit to be against y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm with y‚Äôall. I was just looking for someone who could understand what it‚Äôs like. The opiates give me clarity because they dull my mind. I don‚Äôt want to see everything that I see. Regardless of whether you‚Äôre ‚Äúreligious‚Äù or not, I know this is for a reason.

I don‚Äôt care who thinks I‚Äôm a genius I just used the word to get the attention of someone who can relate to this. I know there are other highly intelligent people out there who use drugs and I wanted to speak with them. This is nothing against someone of average or lesser intelligence.

EDIT 2: throughout my years of drug use (13 years) I‚Äôve sobered up for long periods of time at a time; sometimes even years. When I was sober I never felt like myself. Often times I would go weeks (literally) without sleeping. This lead me to feel fucking insane and angry all the time because I couldn‚Äôt focus on my work. When I started using opiates I was finally able to get some fucking work done. This is what I really mean.

EDIT 3: By genius I don‚Äôt mean an astrophysicist or even someone proficient in calculus. An example of what I mean is- take a look at rapper 6ix9ine. Someone with a narrow mind may say ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an idiot, he‚Äôs bad for the youth‚Äù, etc., etc. but if you look at him from a different lenses you can see that the character itself (of 6ix9ine) is genius. Rap has been the same for as long as rap has been around but this new generation is changing it. The guy colors his hair rainbow- for attention, says crazy things- for attention and then people check out his music (which actually grows on you.)

During my addiction, I ruined relationships with not only my friends but with my community at large due to the ripple effects of heroin addiction stigma.  About half of my good friends, one by one, got into dope, and the other half stayed away and stopped speaking to the ones who started using.  The users very quickly stopped speaking to one another.

Fives years gone, two are clean, two are dead, one is still using and no one is talking to one another.  Our good buddy and one of my best friends passed of an overdose this past Spring.  I did not feel it was my place to go to the funeral... his family hates us.  None of the other users and none of the other clean folk went either.  And so I mourned in my apartment by myself, to my friend's life and to all the wasted years.

(Pure alprazolam powder from Czechoslovakia + Heroin),"      So here's a crazy story that happened in my past. I'm flowing on suboxone, gabapentin and phenibut , and feel like writing out a true tale from my past. 

      I was around 20 years old. I was living for the moment, free of anxiety of consequence. It just happens when you're younger and on drugs. I had recently acquired a job working at a deli in a supermarket in my area. 

    The night before, I was at a friend's place that was about a 30 minute drive from my house. He had just bought pure alprazolam powder from the DN, and let me tell you this shit was real. I remember insufflating a very tiny line, maybe a couple of grains of salt, and feeling barred out the night before. I bought some of his powder and drove home and got home around 11PM to midnight.  (Warning: operating a vehicle under the influence of benzodiazepines is NOT recommended and I don't condone it!) I don't really know how much I bought in terms of weight, because I didn't and still don't own a miligram scale. 

        Fast forward to the next morning. The time is around 8AM. I don't remember going to sleep, but I do remember waking up and feeling VERY good and free. With work coming up in about an hour or so, I came up with the great idea to snort more alprazolam before work, ya know, just to insure I have a great day! I actually snorted the entire content of the bag, which was still a small line about the size of the cotton tip of a Q-tip. It might've been around 8mg to 10mg. 

           I get to work at around 9:30 and I'm a fucking mess lol. I remember I was dropping rotisserie chickens in their case on the ground, picking them back up, and putting them back on the rotisserie lol. So after fucking up for a bit, I decide to quit the job. Right on the spot, I walked up to the manager fearlessly as fuck, and told her I had another job on the line, and that I'm done working there, see ya, bye. She was pissed, but I walked out.

             I decided that now that I was free of that bitch ass job, it was time to get high and get some dope and spend the rest of the day blissed the fuck out. The time is around 11AM. But wait, I don't have any money. Hmmmm.....I KNOW! I'll go into the parking lot of the store that I just quit, and ask their customers for money. Great idea! But first I need a plan, what should I tell them to get their money? I decided it would be best to stay in my work outfit, and tell people I just got laid off from the job, and needed some money for gas to get home, because this store was so evil that they left me on the street with nowhere to go and no money. I kept this gig up until I made $55. Yes, i made $55 in about 30 minutes doing this. 

             Of course, this was making a scene though. Some customers went in and told the manager what I was doing in the parking lot, which got him kind of pissed. So, I WENT BACK IN THE FUCKING STORE AND WALKED TO THE CUSTOMER SERVICE STATION, ASKED FOR THE PHONE TO CALL MY DOPEMAN, AND STARTED COUNTING ALL THE $1S AND $5S I COLLECTED FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS. The dopeman said he'd meet me in the parking lot at the store (I left out the situation and ruckus I just caused in the parking lot...) 

             The manager found me, and started yelling to me from literally the other side of the store. This part is a blur, but all I remember is yelling ""I'M DEPRESSED, PLEASE DON'T CALL THE COPS, I'M LEAVING, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME) (lol imagine this happening) 

           Anyway, I meet my dopeman in his raggedy, beatup, diarrhea colored Buick in the parking lot, buy the dope, and drive home to my house (Yes, I had gas this whole time hehe)  The time is around 12PM. 

         I got 6 bags i think. They were good bags too. White, flakey, almost candy-smelling heroin, with a little whiff of Vitamin B12 and bacon as for the smell as well. Weird combination. Anyway, I think I shot up 2 or 3 bags, and must've made a PB&J sandwich and a bowl of cereal after shooting them. My mom told me she walked by my room, and saw me sitting in my computer chair with my head back, a half a sandwich sitting on my chest, a bite of sandwich in my mouth, and milk and cereal all over the floor. She claims she woke me up, and walked me over to the futon to lay down. I don't remember any of this part at all. 

         Some time after this, I must've woken up and decided to finish the rest of my dope, because the last thing I remember is waking up on the futon waaaaay later in the day. The time was 7PM. 

         I wake up laying on my stomach on my futon, groggy as FUCK, feeling like a truck hit me. I'm talking benz'd the fuck out, with no recollection of even getting out of bed this morning. I lift my head up, and see an uncapped syringe laying under my chest, and a dried trail of blood on my left forearm. I sit up with my head spinning. My mom comes in the room with a look that spelled out a mix of worry, shock, and confusion. 
          ""Do you know what you did today?"" She asked in a normal voice, not yelling or talking down to me or anything. 
        ""Uhhhhh, no?"" I answered. I was actually being honest, because I didn't know. 
        ""You went to work, quit your job, somehow got incredibly fucked up, and passed out with a sandwich laying on your stomach and a bowl of cereal spilled all over the floor!"" She exclaimed. 
             It all hit me like a ton of bricks. The entire recollection of that day burrowed into my brain at that moment like a Madagascar cockroach. 
           ""Whooaaa, I really did. Holy shit. What the fuck??? How???"" I said, completely perplexed with my actions. 

        From that moment forward, I learned to respect the ultimate authority and power that is pure alprazolam powder. I had officially roofied myself.

But if I tell doc, that I use my nose as a vacuum cleaner, he most likely would not prescribe me anything funny.

When I was 13 I wandered into what I thought was an abandoned trailer. 

To my surprised Cinderella was inside. 

Standing behind her was Steve Harvey. 

But between them was a read headed step child probably 12. In the child's hand was a bottle of robitussin. Name was Geebie. 

The kid took a swig as Cinderella did a line of blow and took a shot of whiskey. Jack Daniels. 

Steve Harvey looked at me. ""Welcome to my trailer bitch"". He snarled. 

Confused I pulled out my meth pipe. 
""Y'all ever heard of the 4 stroke gang?"" 

Steve took the pipe from me. Took a long hit. 
Blew it out. His penis became so sensitive he started splooging everywhere.

8rnujb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8rnujb/middles_how_does_your_middle_benefit_from_getting/,7,https://redd.it/8rnujb,TheLemurMaster,"Middles, how does your middle benefit from getting your stuff for you?","I broke a two year sub assisted sobriety in April. Before I got onto subs my drug of choice were pills, mostly oxycodone. They were so freakin expensive so usually I could only afford to take 60-100mg a day. I started on 6mg sub, tapered to 4mg then broke my arm. When I broke my arm badly the doctor upped my dosage to 24mg a day hoping to help me avoid going onto full agonist pain killers. My arm healed but I did not taper and I began to take way more than prescribed. I'd always end up short at the end of the month and would buy some subs at super high prices from a few people I knew. 

In April I ran out two weeks early. No one I knew had enough to sell. I tried to cut my dose down but I would always take more than I rationed figuring I would ""start tomorrow, just 4mg tomorrow for a few days then 2mg and I'll make it to my refill date"".

I didn't have any way to get oxy. I was so out of the game. Finding a hook up was a miracle. I didn't cold cop. I cant say exactly how I found a new middle, but I did.

After a week or two of messaging back and forth we finally made the meet up. He told me $100/g and I told him I'd like a gram and that I would give him $100 for helping. I still had money to spare, so that wasn't a problem. The whole thing went down smoothly. I got home, weighed the bag and it was only .7g. I decided not to say anything because I thought maybe that is how it goes. Usually coke is sold in $50s around here and its .7g despite the dealer calling it a g. 

I had taken my last 6mg of sub 12 hours before and I started my journey into fent dope with the tiniest bump worried that I could possibly OD immediately from this super powerful substance. Nothing much happened. Naturally I still had plenty of buprenorphine holding tight onto my receptors. After a few hours I did reach a state of well being. The stress of mild sub withdrawal was lifted. It was nice. I saved the rest for work the next day and on the way home asked my middle if I could get a $150. No problem he said, it was like he was just waiting for me and was ready. Another smooth transaction. I get home and weigh it, this time it was 1.4g, close enough to 1.5g. It also had what appeared to be and tasted like crushed up Xanax. There were these soft bluish bits, one was quite large. This dope also appeared to be much stronger. It really hit me, wonderful euphoria. That was it, the hooks were in me, my relapse was complete.

As time went on the quality of the dope went up and down. Also the weight of the bags went wild. I am not sure exactly what my middle does in order to benefit from getting me dope. Sometimes the bags would be HUGE but the quality was shit. Like one time he gave me 6g for $200 and it was absolute garbage. 

Early in our relation while I was in the worst withdrawal I had ever experienced he gave me something totally bunk. I thought that was it, he decided to burn me and burn the bridge. I texted him just to say it isn't doing anything. I expected no response. To my surprise he was also in the same boat. I turned around and within an hour he got me a new bag of some real fire. It got me high as a kite and bolstered my faith in him as a trustworthy middle.

For a few weeks everytime I bought a ""gram""  or ""2 grams"" the bag(s) would actually be 2-2.5g and most of the time very high quality. I wasn't understanding how he was benefiting from me. Sometimes though the bag would be soooo much and the powder of a more granular consistency and a much lower potency. I wondered if he was scooping some out and putting regular sugar in it.

More recently though the bags have now returned to be just one gram. The quality is immensely better but it's very rare for it be much over. I guess I can't complain. I got used to taking higher doses because my gram bags were two grams. Now I am doing 2-4 grams a day if I can afford it. It's a very tough day if I have to make it through on just a gram. Fentanyl has no legs at all.

I am very nice and itchy and noddy right now though, and that's why I wanted to right the story. Just a few days ago he was giving me deals like 2g for $130 so I got all these deals and did 2-3 grams a day. Then yesterday I go and spend $200 and the bag is only 1.8g. It was the strongest I have had yet but fuck. I let him know and today gave him $160 and he gave me 2g. That bag weight is all over the map. He must be scooping some out and yesterday scooped too much. So I imagine he benefifs from either grabbing a few points or charging a little more than his guy charges. He also middles for a few other people so maybe his guy hooks him up due to him bringing so much business. Sometimes I give him some extra money, give him a bunch of cigarettes or let him use my credit card to get gas or food.

At the end of the day he's a great middle and performs me a good service. I really really need to stop though. I went back on my suboxone for 3 days last week, I thought I would make it. Now I'm high as hell on fentdope. I am such a world of shit financially, such huuuuge problems. I have to face the music tomorrow when I run out of dope and have no money for anything. wish me luck guys",1529199315.0

That same night this girl (who we'll call L) emailed us saying she could get us a hookup. Because we were broke we couldn't do it but we stayed in contact just in case. As a thank you for offering to help I told L if she needed a favor she could ask us and we'd see what we could do. 

Last night she asked if we could help her because she was out, broke, and sick. Unfortunately we were in the same boat, but I said I'd see what I could do. Later that night I found a MS Contin 30 but by the time I tried to call she was asleep (we were still sick but because we don't shoot it wouldnt even get us well). 

This morning our dealer called and said he needed a favor (because he doesn't have a car and he knows we've been struggling financially we have an arrangement where we'll give him a ride, deliver dope, drop off his dry cleaning, etc, and he'll throw us a .50 and some gas money). 

So we do the favor, get our bag, and I just started feeling really terrible that this girl, who I've never met, never even seen her face, was suffering through withdrawals. I put aside about .2 and told her I could help. She doesn't have a car so she said I'd have to meet her. I'm low on gas, have no cash, but the thought of this girl suffering, or going out and blowing some guy to get cash wouldn't leave my mind. 

I drove down there, waited for 25 minutes because her ride was late, and gave her the dope and the morphine. She was so happy she broke into tears. I'm not making this post to be all ""check me out I'm a generous saint"", just trying to remind you guys that we're all in this together. Sure, a lot of people are dicks who will take advantage of as many people as possible, but the vast majority of us are just struggling to get by. It doesn't take giving someone a gram for free to help them, even something small can help.

Edit: While everything in the post is written in the first person my SO was in this with me the whole way. She feels the exaxt same way I do about the situation. 

Edit 2: Whether you do or do not believe in Karma, something interesting happened today. I just lost my job so I've been looking for odd jobs anywhere I think I'll find one. I made posts on Facebook, Craigslist, Next Door, etc, explaining my story and offering to do jobs for people. I get a few replies with the usual stuff (landscaping, general labor, minor construction) which I'm more than happy to do and it seemed my luck was slightly turning around. Just slightly. 

About 20 minutes after I got home from meeting L I get a response that's just this gentleman's name and phone number. On the phone he tells me he's essentially a professional handyman and that the amount of business is growing faster then his current group can handle. He said he'd love to meet me, and if he likes the first impression I have a job. Basically we're going to meet and talk a little, then I start working almost immediately to see if I'm fit for the work. He asked what my ""current asking rate is"" and I told him at my old job I was making $11.40/hr and I'd like to be making a little bit more than that. He counter offered with $15/hr, 50 hrs/week, paid daily. ",1529196306.0

I typically use heroin but my girl just recently picked up oxycodone and im not really getting anything out of it... she got 20mg lil blue(grey) ones i think they said k 57 on them, the first day i snorted 15mg and got a nice little itch and felt pretty good at first then fell asleep and woke up to try the same thing and literally felt nothing. I snorted another 10mg and still felt nothing.

I gave up and snorted some boy and barely even felt that too!

Im confused because I know my tolerance for boy is manageable and I don't really ever have to increase my dosages by much if any and I try my best to keep it low as possible but now my tolerance or something got all fucked up maybe my nose just wont absorb it anymore or something idk.

I guess my point to this is is there anything I can do to increase the bioavailiability? i know snorting isnt the best but i figure ill atleast get high from the drip and a little bit of rush cause i love the drip and act of crushing/snorting...
And does tolerance rapidly increase with oxies versus heroin?

Even got in very good shape( ripped, shredded with 6 pack abs) but the depression just never got better. took a shit ton of benzos and painkillers and did a half ass attempt at killing myself. i can't keep a job, the second i get money i spend it all on drugs. so those 3 years were me living at my dads.

I don't really chase an extreme high it's mostly i take enough to get a mood lift but that is never sustainable. doing it for so long the mood lifts only last ike two hours. So even though i'll only do like 30 mgs in one shot. if i have them i'll end up doing 200 mg's in one day.

i don't know what to do anymore, i cannot live sober, i did my best and tried very hard. i can't live life on pain killers because i go broke and lose my job to fast. I think about killing myself 24-7.

what the hell should i do? Get on methadone or subs for life? something to just barely tickle my opi receptors long half life where i don't feel like killing myself all day? Right now the only road seems to lead to my death.

Or even weirder, you‚Äôll have your eyes closed nodding and you will still visualize what you think is in front of your closed eyes, clear as day but obviously a bit more hallucinogenic.
I have however noticed there is very little open eyes visuals, however. That‚Äôs so weird that there would be such intense CEVs, I highly suspect it‚Äôs due to the molecules structural similarity to phenethylamines (like MDMA and 2C-B) as well as it having a 4 hydroxy group attachment much like our friends DMT and Psilocybin.


This drug is seriously underrated! And not only does it give classic opiod euphoria (especially when plugged.. DONT snort! Will burn bad!), but it also has these crazy nodding hallucinations created out of your collective memories of recent. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôd close my eyes to nod then a minute later I could make out my wall and blanket and be like ‚Äúwait I thought my eyes were closed‚Äù only to open them and find I was right, and most of the time my open eyed visuals (normally, non-hallucinations) were nowhere near where I was convinced they were based on what I saw with eyes closed. But I didn‚Äôt just hallucinate stuff that‚Äôd been within my sight shortly before nodding, I also witnessed serene landscapes and entities. Like some DMT or high level acid trip shit üòù it was wild


And yet another unique property of this opiod- it almost even seems to produce GABA or GABA-like activity because it can make me stumble, feel very dreamy and forgetful as well..
And at 0.65¬¢ For 100 mg doses from india (i only took 125 mg and tripped/nodded sack, this may be the great new opiod.

I also have about 5g kratom, 20ml more syrup, and 4mg suboxone. I also have quite a few 5mg klonopins and 4 50mg vyvanse. How should I spread this out to get me through the next week or so. I'm trying to taper down as best I can to minimize withdrawal symptoms. I

The place is always filled with hookers and some of the gnarliest junkies I‚Äôve ever encountered. So I go in, place is filled with people  so Mr.traphouse suggests we go upstairs so we can do our business in private. He give me 6 .2 baggies and in the hand off one is dropped. I start looking around for it on the bathroom floor while he goes to grab some more boy to make up the difference and all of a sudden the door gets closed and I am now cornered by a 6‚Äô 5‚Äù junkie with a massive kitchen knife and he‚Äôs trying to rob me/force me to buy his clearly fake drugs. I make it very clear I‚Äôm not interested and need to leave. I try to pass him and manage to get the door open. As soon as my foot crossed the threshold he slams me up against the wall and sticks the knife point in my side and forces me back into the bathroom. He says ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt no gangster, but right now I don‚Äôt give a fuck. You aren‚Äôt leaving this bathroom till I have everything on you‚Äù so I pulled out a 20 and tell him that‚Äôs all I have left after copping my shit. He isn‚Äôt having it. He comes at me with the knife down and I basically spin move out of the way and broke the door off the hinge barreling through it. And I am booking it for the front door with Knife Boy hot on my tail. Everyone starts screaming to stop ME! Mr.Traphouse is on the porch and blocks me from getting outside. So I yelled ‚Äúthis dudes trying to rob me with a knife‚Äù Knife boy holds up the knife and denies such a thing happening. Mr.Traphouse pistol whips him out cold. Happened so fast I jumped. He goes in his pockets, get me my 20 and breaks me off a half gram of boy and a half gram of hard. Then he walks me to my vehicle apologizing the whole way.

I was sexually abused by my older brother for 3 years almost everyday which started anywhere from 4-6 it‚Äôs hard to remember. 

I have horrible fucking mental illness from it. Crippling PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia. I also suffer HPPD from years of daily chronic cannabis abuse and psychedelic abuse and I can‚Äôt use those anymore cause they cause serious disassociation. 

Anyway,My girlfriend just dumped me out of nowhere after on and off for 5 years, 3 years on and I also found out she was cheating. I loved her man. She is the only girl I‚Äôve ever come close to having sex with. 

All around me i see people my age living life to the fullest. They‚Äôre going places, they have goals and aspirations, they have no problem being social, they have no problems making friends, they have no problems getting girls.

I am so fucking alone. And I truly don‚Äôt care weather I live or die.

I have some experience with opiates. I use Vicodin and Oxy when I can get my hands on it, but in this area it is so fucking rare to get pills, they might as-well be non existent. There is no open air market.

However it is super easy to get Tar. 

Tomorrow I‚Äôm truly planning on buying my first gram. If I die I fucking die I guess.

I actually thought it was long lost, but after searching around quite a bit, I found some old notebooks, and thankfully, this was one piece I had in there.  Much of the stuff I lost was due to typing up pieces, only to have a hard drive crash without having backed things up properly.  I ended up going back to pen and paper shortly after that happened, though I haven't had the inspiration to write anything in years, hence sharing older stuff.  I wrote it back in '03, I remember quite well.  I hadn't been using terribly long, was all about some 80s, and had just discovered a lot of the guys that would become personal favorites, like Whitman, Thoreau, and Emerson.  I'm sure I was probably trying to emulate them somewhat, which isn't to say I actually succeeded lol.  But, it was weird revisiting the piece years later, just because, while I hadn't been using long enough to be a full blown addict, I could see the road I was headed down in retrospect, just seeing where my mind was at the time.  Anyway, enough introduction...)


As I solemnly stroll through the barren field

Serene as it may seem

The field is filled with all I've killed

Crushed hopes and broken dreams

--

And where do I lie

In this hazily constructed area

It occurs to me

How strange all of this is

Others see me clearly

Perceived as quite askew

Though I can see nothing

As I peer from an obstructed view

Yet still I hope to find that line

The line that is straight

Which I'm obviously not used to

--

Most of my exploits

Involved a path quite jagged

Justifying how I ended up in this mess to begin with

--

It seems every turn to take in this field

Leads to the wrong place

Either that or I'm led back to the beginning

Which is equally as frustrating

--

Because then

I have to once again

Face all of these obstacles

Constantly growing exponentially

As many aspects of me continue to fade away

--

Not quietly, as the setting sun

But rather viciously

Like a child being scarred for the first time

--

They can only fade for so long

Until their existence ceases altogether

And if at that point

I have yet to make it through this field

I'll be forced to wander aimlessly

For an eternity, or perhaps longer

--

But at this point it is hard to tell

What I am searching for

Hopefully I could find some of the things I've lost

And possibly revive some that I've killed

--

Although I was seeking an end to this maze

I suppose in the end

To find the happiness I've misplaced

Could be better than any other imaginable outcome

--

So I begin again

Back to the front, tabula rasa

Unsure of where to start

Like a newborn attempting to learn to speak

With no one around to help teach

--

I catch a glimmer in the far distance

So I follow the bright light

I believe at one point in time

I was told that this was a viable option

--

But the longer I walk toward the light

The farther away it appears

--

Logic would tell one to rethink the plan at this point in time

But there is no time for that

So I continue walking, trusting my instincts

For that is all that I'm left with

Because I have lost everything else

Somewhere in this damn field

And with no clue where to look

This bright light must be an omen

--

So I muster up any vigor that remains

In this former shell of myself

And try to find my way amongst all this treachery

To the shining light

--

This time, however, as I begin approaching the light

It does not seem to distance itself from my onslaught

In fact, it is locked in place at this point

Statue-esque as if struck by Medusa herself

--

""A-Ha!""

I say to myself

""This time I've got the little bastard""

--

So I begin to run

Sprinting with all my might

Toward this shining light

And while its mobility may have been nullified

A feeling of terror still encompasses what remains of this mortal coil

--

As I approach this time

The light becomes increasingly dimmer

And the closer I get

The quicker it fades

--

I begin to wonder if this journey is even worth the time

Though my other options are quite limited

Or rather nonexistent, if you must

--

As I make it to the location of the light it has completely faded

And all is dark again

--

Just as I begin to ponder

Any possibility of escaping this predicament

All of my concerns soon become irrelevant

--

The darkness emitted this light to lure me in

As nonchalantly as a fisherman

--

And just like that fisherman

Now that it has grasped me

And has me for its own

Everything that I know matters no more",1529140270.0

Came over and was like 'homegirls in the bathroom in the store right there, just give me the money and I'll run over and grab it""

I fell asleep with a nice shot made up and didnt notice till i woke up around 10 hours later.

(AKA middle man used phone to call plug and left number on there),"Hi all, if you were a dealer, would you be happy for a new customer? I mean i know there are people who would be happy to get a new customer to make $$$$, but then there are some who get sketched out easily.

The situation is kind of like this, found out a coworker also does dope. Powder dope is more rare and costs more. 'China White' is all my coworker buys and does. He only snorts, where i use rigs and tar since most of my area all I've had luck finding is tar. After finding out he used, we'd drive up sometimes to cop. My tar dude lives a few miles away from his guy so we'd just share a ride sometimes. I would get my tar, he would get his China. He kept telling me to try it so I did one day. It was definitely a different feeling. The Tar would keep me well longer, but the rush from the China was a different type of rush, kind of more euphoric in a way. 
Anyways, so since trying it, I've started to throw in money a few times to get something from his guy. But some reason I suspect he tries to pinch it no matter what, even when I get a dub. It's ironic because  whenever my coworker will get a dub for himself, it will look extra fat, but whenever i throw in money to get a dub, it'll be extra small. Like maybe twice when i couldn't go up, i've asked for a half G and he'd bring me back something I thought was a .5, but after seeing his sacks, it would look like a dub his dealer gives him. i don't have a scale so I never knew. 
ANd this is everytime, when only he gets something from his guy, it looks fat, but everytime i throw in for something, he'll say that's just what he gave him and i'tll be mad small. 
My coworker also doesn't have a phone so he uses mine when we go up together and always deletes the number after. But 2 days ago, he left the number in there while he went outside and i wrote the number down before he deleted it after he came back in.

So i have the guys number, but i don't know his name. My coworker did a good job of making his connect avoid coming to the car as well. Liek everytime, I've dropped him off like 20 feet away or he'd alway get out of the car to walk to his guy. Now I know why. So I don't think he's ever seen my face before, but possibly my car. I could keep getting tar, but i want to try something new, if you guys were in my situation, how would you guys try to reach out to the China plug? Or would you even try? I don't know if my coworker was trying to scare me or not, but he said never go down there alone. He said dudes down there will just take ur money if they don't know you and just say, 'what money'? , but i'm sure if i can make myself out to be a steady customer that will bring steady cash flow, he'd be happy for that, no?",1529116708.0

My wife and I decided it's going to be best to drive back since 4 plane tickets (wife, son, myself and dog) would cost quite a bit more for tickets to get there and back, as well as renting a car for 2 months. We'll make the drive in 3 long days, staying in two hotels. The whole trip will only cost about $600-$700. I mean...it's definitely not money im stoked about putting out. But hey, it's the best option at this point.  
  
Thank you all for the advice and kind words, and just telling this douche bag how wrong he/she is and what an asshole he/she is.  
bro clearly you're too incompetent to understand my original post. Thus being the reason you replied with such negative, ignorant, and useless things to say. I didnt blame anyone...my lawyer actually did a pretty good job, seeing as how i only have to do 4 months when the minimum is 2-5 years and it's not my first offense in that state.  
  
Yea, i made quite a bit of a problem for myself. Again, since youre too stupid to retain anything you read...ill repeat it. This happened over 2 years ago. My child is 2.5, the case is 2.5 years...can you do basic math? I dont need to explain to you my choices in life. Im sure a lot of us (except you apparently, you must be a saint) have made bad decisions in life. I just happen to be paying the price for one of mine years down the road.  
And ill repeat this as well, even though numerous other people told you already...im only upset with my lawyer for not getting back to me over a month ago when he first knew about this. I could have 2 months to plan this out...instead I have 2 weeks. But im done with your stupid ass. Have fun being a moron IRL.  
Oh yea, and if anyone else has ever had to do any jail time in California...you will probably know what it's like. It blowwwws big time compared to any other state ive been to. I mean the prison politics that trickle down into jails is so shitty. Being white and having no choice but to run with the peckerwoods (whiteboys) im kinda forced into the lifestyle while im there.  
**Just a little bit of that life is something like this:**  
No talking to blacks, or other races  
Most certainly do not eat food they have touched  
No drinking from the water fountain that other races use.  
If a black used a toilet that im about to use before me...i have to spray and wipe it clean.  
I'm forced to work out with woods (whiteboys) twice a day in case a fight breaks out. (The OG peckerwoods control this, and want you to be beefed up, pretty much as a soldier for the whites)  
  
That's just a little of the prison politics. It fucking sucks, i dont live that way in real life...dont care to at all. But in there its different. You kind of have to, or you'll be a loner and when shit hits the fan, which it does a lot in this place...you'll be alone, and you dont want that to happen.  
It's unbelievable how barbaric they live in there, i dont get it. If i was lucky enough to go back at a time that the facility im speaking of is wayyy too full, ill luck out and spend my time in regular county jail. This is a jail turned into a prison. But it's a prison that happens to be ran by the county sheriff's dept. instead of the state like normal state pens.

Addressing Running into Traffic from Post 2
====

**I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and I own it that that was wrong. If I could apologize to those drivers I would. I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway, I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center. They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**

I know I'm Disliked Here
===

Despite being disliked by some here, I feel sharing my story is not only cathartic or important for myself but, it if it at least helps one other person going through the same sort of shit, then good. I'm glad I shared. We've all done fucked up things with our addictions, and now it's about restoring the damage done and moving forward. I just hate how quick some of you are to judge when you're not going through it. Just like I can't judge you based on a few paragraphs or stories - you can't judge me because of what I have to on a opiates related forum. I don't sit and judge anyone here. I find mutual respect is the best medicine. **I kindly ask that any critiques given are constructive and not downright mean.** I'm really trying to improve here and am taking the first steps towards that.

5 Days Sober, Let's Restart
===

Just working on my life now. I have several job potentials in my email plus I'm meeting with a counselor Monday. They require 3 recovery meetings a week along with 9 hours worth of recovery group work weekly. We'll see if this program is a fit for me. It's covered by my insurance - their inpatient is not. Either way, I'm just picking up the pieces and starting over. The recovery AA/NA or SMART meetings are way outside of my comfort zone. They're just emotionally triggering so I have a friend that's willing to take me to my first meeting hopefully it goes well, we'll see. 

The Pain is Real
===

I have a real pain problem. Even the counselor today asked if I was still in withdrawal or pain. The pain is localized so I'm pretty sure it's actual pain vs. withdrawal. Especially because my UA came up negative for opioids. I do have a residual cold now though because of the exhaustion and lowered immune system from the withdrawal but that's not a biggie. What's going to be trick is finding something that works for the pain that isn't opiate based. I think right now it's all about keeping clear and developing better coping mechanisms for my situation. I'm not sure what that looks like right now but at least I'm taking steps towards it.",1529109093.0

We will be at one of their houses, and we will be there for the better part of a day (10-12 hours.)

I am going to do a shot right before arriving that should hold me over for a solid 5-6 hours, but I know that around that point is when I usually notice feeling kinda anxious. We are all volunteering for a cause that I care a lot about, and will be on the phone talking to folks the entire time so I need to be on my game/feeling comfortable. 

If I fix a shot and bring it with me, is there anything that I should be aware of? I know that dope in water begins to change molecularly into morphine so I realize it will be weaker. I just don‚Äôt want to get into the bathroom and the dope have turned into a solution that is too thick or weird to use. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable fixing a shot there due to time/all the different accessories that I would need. 

I am using tar, and it does occasionally take some work to get a large shot into the rig, so I‚Äôm thinking that I should make a few shots with more water than I normally use to be safe and not have it become too thick to shoot.

I am on suboxone maintenance but I have been clean from heroin a year on May 22nd. 

I would be proud of myself except when it came out that I was a heroin addict to my family, it motivated my cousin to go to our family and admit that she was struggling with her sexuality and with alcoholism too. She said she wouldn't have done it if I wouldn't have gotten help. She went to rehab and had gotten sober from alcohol. She was in the National Guard, had graduated certified in chemical weaponry iirc. I was so proud of her. She had always looked up to me and followed in my foot steps but this past year we had really bonded and looked to each other for support. We would text or snap each other telling each other that we were proud of each other and that we motivated each other. She was a HUGE support to me. Just having her look up to me and having her be motivated by me made me want to keep doing good.

Well, May 2nd of this year was my 29th birthday. My last birthday in my 20's and 20 days shy of one year clean of heroin. It started out as a normal day but ended up the worst day of my life. I'm not sure when it happened, but my cousin had fallen off the wagon at some point and had killed herself on my birthday. This really, really, really, fucked with me. I'm SLOWLY getting better but there was a solid month where I didn't know if I was coming or going. The only reason I didn't relapse was because I knew she would be disappointed in me. I blamed myself. I have a lot of regrets regarding my cousin that I can't get over. I know that I need to go to counseling to really work through this and that is my plan, I just have to get some things out of the way first, one mainly being my dog's surgery. Which I took care of yesterday. My dog is like my kid and I was really worried about her. Now that that is off my plate, I thought I could relax some but my ex seems to have impeccable timing and decided to text me after months of no contact. 

I'm trying to stay healthy, and on the right path. For the last year I've been talking to a guy that I did absolutely fall in love with but he didn't feel the same about me and I could hear it in his voice. I don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with me because it just makes me feel bad about myself, so I broke it off. It still fucking hurts really fucking bad, but I can't force him to love me. It's sad though because a lot of our issues are internet related (we were long distance) and i'm sure if we lived near each other those things wouldn't even be an issue.... Anyway, the ex from my heroin days is texting me again. Apparently he is doing good and I'm glad he is doing good but I feel like he is trying to squeeze his way back into my life again and I know for a fact that this cannot happen. We were toxic for each other. I know this. I hate that he is hurting over me, but if we ever ended up together again, which we won't, it would end VERY bad. I told him yesterday that I didn't want him to get any ideas of us getting back together and to start calling me and obsessing over me and he said that he wouldn't, he just needed a friend and I know the most about him (we lived together 10 years). That would be believable if there wasn't 20 texts from him on my phone this morning and for the fact that he has been texting me all fucking day. I am trying to stay on the right path but with everything negative that's happened recently - breaking up with the guy i'm really in love with, my dogs surgery, my cousins death, etc., I hope I'm strong enough to put a stop to this.. I really do. Any suggestions are welcome.. I need the help. ",1529099879.0

Then proceeded to add 25units of clam/pg I had pre-measured in oral syringe, added that to cooker with the Pre-mixed heroin solution... Any one who has IV'D PG solutions no they r to syrup-y w/out adding water, but we are taking it up a notch and adding heroin infused water to thin out the propene glycol solution so that it will easily draw up.... So now we have a quarter g of high quality heroin, and a PG solution containing 1mg of c-lam... Together at a total volume of 40 units, take 5 more units of sterile h2o, and add that along with everything else in the cooker (4 a total volume of 45 units of total liquid, (I have half ml syringes, so 45 units gives me just enough room to comfortably register)... Mix again thoroughly... Filter, draw up, and inject.... I feel real fuckin good right now, maybe 15mins after injecting.
      1st u get the rush of the IV heroin, followed by a slower come up of the iv Clonazolam.. I'm at maybe twenty min elapsed now, I feel warm, euphoric, very euphoric... And then the heaviness and relaxation/ anxiety inhibition creep up, slowly but surely ever minute that goes by it is more and more pronounced:):):). 
   I'd highly suggest it to people highly tolerant to opiates/Benzos, and more importantly tolerant to combining both Benzos&opi's, about to do another, and I'll b absolutely done for the rest of the day.

Doesn‚Äôt knock me on my ass, and if I‚Äôm out and about doing stuff I‚Äôm not really impaired, just cheery. 

I came across some XR morphine 30. If this sounds familiar I already made a post about this asking questions a week ago but now I have just a slightly different question for anyone who has the time to help a sister out.

Planning on plugging it because of BA. So using the charts on the sticky I see that orally 10mg of morphine is 6.67 mg of oxy, so my 30mg morphine equivalent to roughly 20mg oxycodone. So this is where I want to double check. If the bioavailability for the morphine goes up from 30% orally to 70% rectally, the 30mg morphine should go from being equivalent to 20mg of oxy to more like 45 mg. Does that sound about right? Because if so I‚Äôm looking at a dose that‚Äôs a little higher than what I‚Äôm use to and should maybe start with less than a full pill? 

And does the crushing and plugging bypass the time release? I‚Äôm thinking that would effect the potency one way or the other as well. 

What do you guys think? I used all the sidebars like I‚Äôm suppose to before asking, just want to make sure I‚Äôm getting it right. 

Interested in hearing from people familiar with the dose and roa as well.

Noone here does. And my family back home thinks I'm 2 years clean. Anyways.... I come up with a plan. Not an amazing one... But a plan. I text him and first ask ""hey can you front me a gram until tomorrow""? He says yes bc we have done this before. So next I tell him my situation and just say... ""Listen do me a favor. Just leave the shit in a cigarette box by the driver side door of my car in the driveway. Ill run out and grab it as soon as you drop it off"". I couldn't have her see I was going to meet some gangster lookin ass dude outside her house at one a.m. to hand him money and come back in. I can't blow my cover here. I try hard not to at least. Anyways. He agrees. So I wait for the text that its there. He messages me ""its there"". I immediately say to her "" hey I forgot my cigarettes in the car ... I'm gonna go grab them"". Walk outside and.... Nothing is there. Mind you we are on a back road. No one is around . I came out 30 seconds after he text me. There is zero possibility someone grabbed it or him leaving it at the wrong address. So I feel my stomach dropping and I frantically make the call to him and ask him where the fuck he left it. He says to me that he left it there.... Which is totally impossible. Not only that but he says now I owe him for that.... And I have to pay for it regardless if I want any more shit off of him. LOL. Needless to say I never hit him up again. He thought he was my only dude and I had no choice but to pay him that money if I ever wanted his shit again. That shit still pisses me off to this day. That was a total junkie move. Peace out dude... You're not the only monkey in the circus.",1529081222.0

I have minor scoliosis and went to 6 different doctors to see if I was able to be prescribed anything besides a weak ass muscle relaxer they were getting me to try (which had no positive effects) and went the easy route buying my own meds black market style. I created this habit starting off on 10mg hydros and 10mg oxycodones. Throughout my years of abusing this medicine I have created a tolerance, obviously, but I never tried to fit the need of getting high enough to try anything hard (dat boy.) The maximum I would take in a day would‚Äôve been around 80-90mg of hydros mainly. Yes I would rail a mblock 30 if it came around at the right price but for the most part of my addiction I stayed with minor opiates knowing the dangers. I always kept up with how much acetaminophen I was consuming so I avoided as much liver damage as possible. 3 days ago was my breaking point after trying to come up on some and finding nothing but fake pressed Watson 853s that broke down like powder in my mouth and made me fatigued enough to lay down at work. I‚Äôm so tired of relying on a dboy everyday to help me feel normal. I came clean with my parents and told them my problem and they supported me. We have decided mutually that I need medical advisory and rehab just to keep me grounded from where I‚Äôve come from. My doctor told me that cold turkey was too dangerous and prescribed me 4 hydro 5mg daily to wing me down. I wanted to get tram but she insisted. I literally begged her not to give them to me. I know this is going to be a life long struggle but the money I make and was forking out is my motivation along with giving my parents there son back and of course being healthy again.  But I know that I can‚Äôt do this alone so any wise words from this forum will help tremendously. This is the end of this road for me truly. I‚Äôm more into putting it into action with little said instead of just saying oh yeah I‚Äôll quit I‚Äôll be ok.

West to east. Well 2.5 years ago i had gotten caught with a bunch of xanax, 492 i believe was the exact number. Anyway, they put out a warrant and i had no idea. Well i also had a dui case from the same week that the xanax situation happened. I missed court and just didnt think about it for about 2.5 years. Anyway, i decided to goto rehab last july and get clean, then moved the family out with me to the east coast. I remembered i had that DUI case to worry about. so i hired a lawyer back in the west coast state to goto court for me. He got me a deal. 8 days in jail, serve 4 with no probation or anything. It was actually for 2 dui's possession of heroin and 2 paraphernalia charges for crack stems, this was all within 10 days. So i go back last feb. to serve my 4 days in jail...upon release they tell me i have an outstanding warrant in another county, which was just the county a few miles away. I post bond on that and get to go back home to state on the east coast. Well, i re-hired the same lawyer for this case...he swears up and down i wont have any jail time for it, since its so old and only a C4 substance and i had already voluntarily went to rehab and gotten clean. I knew this was too good to be true, but couldnt help but be hopeful. Anyway, court for this was on May 9th, which i didnt have to appear at. I called my lawyer the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 14th, 15th. Left messages, never got any calls back. I assumed they had dropped the case like he kept insisting they would.  
Well yesterday, 06/14/2018, over a month after court, i get a letter in the mail saying this is a Time urgent message. It states that the only deal i could get was to serve 4 months but no probation. And if i dont make it back my the end of this month to turn myself in, the deal will no longer be available and the judge that agreed on it is moving up to a new courtroom so will no longer be there. Soooo, if i dont make it back 2,300 miles across country in two weeks i will miss out on that deal and have to see a new judge who probably wont be willing to cut me a deal like this one.  
To top it off, ive been out of work since 02/25/2018 due to major back/spine surgery that i had on 04/06/2018. So ive exhausted all funds available to myself and wife. I picked up another job to bring in some income until i can get back to my normal job.  
I now have to come up the money somehow to get back across country, but i have a wife and son who have to come with me, oh and my dog. Which mean we're driving because its wayyyy cheaper than all those plane tickets. She would stay here but we have no one to watch out son while she works and she wont be able to afford daycare without my income. Back there she has her family who can babysit while she works, while i sit in jail so that when i get out we'll be ready to move back east.  
  
Sorry for ranting, and probably not making much sense, since my mind is all over the place. Im stressed the fuck out, on how we're going to get back, im pissed about having to goto jail...Im **MOST** upset at my lawyer who couldnt even call me to tell me this, and give me time to prepare. Instead i get two weeks notice. I have to inform both jobs of mine, and my wifes job that we're leaving, for 2 months!  
 
Now the shittier part. Im on 75mg/day of methadone. They say theyre going to try and detox me as fast as possible, but i know it isnt possible to come off that quick.  
All i want to do is get high honestly. im dreading going to jail being sick from methadone WD's the whole time.

Everyone's independent circumstances; both internal and relational, are definitely nuanced. But generally; should we nevertheless just surrender to these moments? Their words may be cloaked in a stigmatised sense of righteousness; but are often so profoundly incorrect and hurtful. Should we accept that having made these mistakes we are forevermore second to and beneath them? That we are shittier human beings?

Want to make a separate comment on here about how this affects me, I think it's critical for us pain patients to speak out. I'll try to keep it brief. After being mangled as a pedestrian hit by a car, I will have chronic pain in my leg for the rest of my life. I have massive Hardware in my leg, rod in my femur was multiple screws in my hip and knee. I was study on a low script for 6 years just fine, suddenly lost my script for 10 mg oxy without having done anything wrong, I wasn't abusing it I just could not afford an MRI uninsured that a new guideline required me to have to continue being prescribed it.

Not at all blaming anyone else for my addiction, but I must say that I never once bought a pill on the street during those 6 years. What did happen though, was me going to the streets and mediately after losing that script. When pills got expensive 6 months later I was using heroin. And the two years since I have absolutely destroyed my entire life. I want from someone who was unfortunately hit by a car at 16 and stuck with a lifetime of some pretty rough pain, so now someone who also has that same chronic pain but is additionally ifucking heroin addict on top of it.

What is going on with pain patients and their scripts is complete and utter bullshit.
- People on scripts for years, even older riddled with arthritis and a stack of things wrong causing them pain, are fearing being cut off, likely without even as much of the taper, and they the day is going to happen.
- People are being pushed to Suboxone for pain management, when the reality is that it doesn't help everybody's pain and I do experience a pretty noticeable decrease in pain control by using that for paying since I am in recovery for my addiction now. 
- 7-Day scripts are not going to help anyone, and are truly ridiculous for anybody that's not post-op or a temporary injury that will heal, people that are going to be prescribed long-term should be prescribed on a 30-day basis. Sure, hold people accountable, drug test pill count whatever. But limiting the script so drastically is so detrimental. Going from pill Mills insane High unnecessary oxy scripts to anybody that says their back hurts, to ibuprofen and being told to stretch when you have documented proof of legitimate pain, is not the answer.

Pain patients are becoming criminals, risking felonies to supplement their lost script when they turn to the streets. Pain patients still need to go to work functioning when they are aching and withdrawing following their inevitable off from their medication. Soccer moms are out there buying pills in the hood, people with low tolerance is that are buying illicitly are having to worry dying from a fentanyl or random research chemical press when it would be avoided altogether if they could just get a goddamn script, pain patients that never even abused their scripts are being treated like junkie scum. Chronic pain is debilitating, chronic pain has made me suicidal. People should not be contemplating suicide seriously because they are in such severe untreated paying, I have seen more than one post on here and the chronic pain sell about people wanting to end their life because they hurt so bad.

I can think of a handful of solutions that would solve much of this, but it seems like the ignorant people that are in charge of it I have no idea what they're doing. Hey, maybe a requirement to be in charge of this shit should be having chronic pain. Because clearly everyone's ignorant, lacking compassion, and seems to want people jumping from the doctor's office to shooting dope over untreated pain...

 1. If they are going two limits scripts like this and push pain patients on Suboxone, let people get methadone easier as well. Allow Kratom to be a thing as it keeps a lot of people's pain and check without having to escalate to harder things. You can walk into a Clinic being a heroin addict and get a high dose of methadone that would absolutely kill pain. But yet it's much harder to get it prescribed for pain... Why? As an addict I have full compassion for other items, however it's somehow easier for drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair, drug addicts to get help then it is for pain patients to get pain. That is not fair at all.

 2. Cut that 7-Day script bullshit for chronic pain 

3. Let primary care doctors continue treating moderate pain, ultimately though just let doctors be fucking doctors and not refuse to prescribe and fear of their DEA license. 

4. Stop continuously decreasing the amount that doctors can write, and insurance companies need to stop suddenly refusing to cover more than a certain morphine equivalents in a script. Bust the doctors that are actually abusing their power and wrongly over prescribing opiates script, let the others be and treat their damn patience the way that they see fit as... A doctor! 

5. This isn't something that government would do, but still something that would help all this... Pain management clinics need to cut the cash-only bullshit some of them do, and methadone and Suboxone need to be more easily accessible as it would help pain patients and also addicts as well. 

6. People need to drop a goddamn stigma around people taking opiates for pain! It's totally possible to use it as prescribed and not be a junkie, and stop shiting on the people that have fallen into addiction after pain issues. Thing of simultaneous pain patient and raging addict has made me want to kill myself at times because it is such a goddamn miserable existence . Stop telling people with debilitating pain to suck it up, stop being so uncompassionate, trust me if Tylenol worth we would fucking take it. I would love a normal life. 

7. And for those that r a simultaneous addict and being patient like myself, like I stated above, which is a more and more common story these days the current state of this shit... Make methadone the remedy for this if Suboxone doesn't work. People seem to develop the belief that if you form an addiction you don't deserve pain control and should suffer, no... That's bullshit. I'm an addict, and my pain is still real and valid. I deserve treatment, I don't deserve to be shit on for something I didn't ask for. I didn't ask to be injured, I didn't ask to lose a script that I was studying on for 6 God damn years.

That about concludes my rant I guess. This whole thing is fucked. I'm bitter at ruining my life ending up on heroin immediately following losing a script, it's bullshiter it's not fair. I'm better at the what ifs, I'm bitter thinking that this probably wouldn't have been My outcome  otherwise. I'm bitter that I wasn't abusing my script, and lost it without warning. I'm better that I have fucking shot up heroin because of the progression of events. I get to enjoy life of chronic pain and being an addict. It's miserable,  and I'm determined to use every breath I have to use my voice  to speak out on this and to help pain patients, addicts, those are both etcetera.  Too many people are  stigmatizing  these groups. At the end of the day, I'm still just a God damn person beneath my addiction and a person that just doesn't want to hurt anymore. A person that is considered suicide to make it stop, on multiple occasions. 


TL DR, nobody gives a fuck about pain patients when implementing these policies.  Pain patients are turning into criminals. Pain patient  with no record are catching felonies buying their medication on the streets. Pain patients are using heroin. Pain patients are becoming suicidal over such debilitating pain. Pain patients are not always addicts. But if they are addicts, they still deserve relieved! Pain patients should not have to fight for a script for Percocet with extensive documented damage to their body. Pain patients being prescribed opioids are not why there is an epidemic! Pain patients are not responsible for past over prescribing. Pain patients deserve options to feel normal. Pain patients wish that non narcotics and injections would work. Pain patients are tired. Pain patients are being neglected. Pain patients are using fucking heroin and it should not be happening ever due to a lost script by someone not even abusing it!!! I repeat, pain patients are using fucking heroin  to treat their pain. Pain patients are your parents, your grandparents, your peers, or you someday. Pain patients that are young still have pain that is just as valid and should not be dismissed for their age. Pain patients are not often just drug Seekers.. Pain patients don't deserve to be treated like junkie scum for treating their pain with opioids. Pain patients shouldn't be told to suck it up, ever. Pain patients for the most part did not ask for their pain! Pain patients are not the ones crying wolf begging for stronger and stronger meds. Pain patients are overdosing and dying. Pain patients are risking coming into contact with fentanyl. Pain patients just want a normal quality of life, want to be able to work play with their kids enjoy their free time Etc. But instead leave doctor's appointments in tears with their pain untreated, invalidated, and driving them insane. If you have not experienced chronic pain, please have compassion for those who do deal with it. And please do not try do finesse an opiate script when you don't need one, every post on here that's ever been made asking for tips in the ER or the doctor took score a script takes away from people who really need it and it's bullshit. I truly want to punch every motherfuker in the face that fake pain to any extent trying to score opioids, it's an insult two people that never asked for pain and never asked you truly need these drugs. Thanks to anyone that's listen, and to those that are hurting along with me I hope you have a day of minimal pain and please feel free to message me anytime to connect to someone else who gets it.",1529064763.0

](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8q6byk/im_checking_into_the_hospital_tonight/)

I went to one hospital which referred me to another. I was completely suicidal and verbalized this to both hospitals. The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.

I was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. 

Some 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.

I got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.

They decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early & I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.

Now here I am 

4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.

Anyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain. I'm hoping that subsides soon.

**Edit: I realize running into traffic was a bad idea. I really could have endangered someone else and i own it that that was wrong. If i could apologize to those drivers I would.  I was in a very fucked up state of mind. Anyway I'm currently checking into an outpatient treatment center.  They do not feel inpatient is right for me especially since I'm already detoxed. Right now I'm just going to put the pieces back together, own and accept my mistakes and move forward.**",1529057107.0

My method, in hindsight and through testing, doesn't work and it involved mixing the ""powder"" (read:beads) with baking soda and melting it together in a toaster oven on something metal and then throwing it in the freezer to stop the heating . Then I would scrape it up and snort it.

Well firstly, baking soda burns like the devils taint up your nose. Secondly, it still takes a good while for it to work.

The new method I just discovered involves using alcohol as a solvent and sugar as a medium for solidification of sorts. I made a small pile out of a 36mg Xtampza capsule on an aluminum plate (the side of a vaping mod). I added drop after drop of tequila until the whole pile was thoroughly wetted and was starting to run. Using a small coffee straw I mixed the booze and the XT together until it seemed to be dissolved. Then I added a pinch of white sugar to it to collect it all and stop it from running all over the place. Then I heated it in the toaster oven until it swelled up and bubbled slightly.

Immediately I put it in the freezer to stop the heating process and to solidify the goop. This method didn't give me a pile of material that I could snort unfortunately so I scraped it all up and ate and chased it down with some soda.

The alcohol/heating definitely broke it down as it wasn't granular hardly at all AND it tasted pretty f-ing good. More importantly, within 25 mins I was fucking high as if I ate 40mgs of oxy IR. Normally with Xtampza you have to wait at least and hour to feel it fully.

\*\* TL;DR: Mix Xtamza powder and alcohol until dissolved, add sugar and heat in oven until bubbly, freeze for 10 seconds, remove and eat. \*\*

Fucked up in T+25mins.

Hope it works for you all. Im sure there's a better medium than sugar that might result in a crushable/snortable final product. I just don't know what that might be.....corn starch?",1529053543.0

I was sweating, shaking, pacing the rooms of my home looking for some sort of relief. This was a pain that struck a familiar nerve and I remembered experiencinging it a decade ago. Mother fucking kidney stone pain and it seemed way more intense than last time.

Yet I was very reluctant to stroll to my local emergency department. See the first time I had stones many years ago I was into drugs, but hadn't yet scared my arms with thousands of needle stabs. When I went to the ER that time it was Dilaudid buffet, with the nurse proclaiming during my discharge, ""Oh, you've still got another shot (my 3rd) on your precription, want it for the road?"" Fuck yeah I said, and by the time I got home 5 minutes down the road I projectile vomited everywhere. I was having a blast.

In between then and the present I had totally fucked my life by jumping on dope and banging, leaving obvious marks in the crooks of my arm. It has been a few years since I got clean and got my life on track but the marks are obvious and the health care junkie radar has been hyped to NORAD proportions. I was not hopeful my ER visit would result in easing my pain.

However, something had to be done, and even if they would not afford me pain medication I at least needed to get this checked out. You don't want to fuck up your kidneys. I stumbled in and was taken to triage. They took one look at me and it was clear I was not having a good time. Vitals checked, now it's timed to get blood drawn. The first barrier. They draw from my left, by far the worst of the two. They tell me to go to another area, but as I get up a nurse says, ""Sit down, I'm gonna give you something for the pain."" Thank Christ.

I got a IM injection of Toradol which I had never heard of (worrying) and which I now know is a NSAID. This shit actually brought my pain down to not great, but fairly managebale pain. I had to wait until a room was ready for me. I was pretty impressed this weak ass drug actually did something and they get me a room and get a CT going. 

In the meantime they don't give me any narcotics but ask how comfortable I am. Im honest and say for now I'm ok but the pain is coming in waves. I'm not really trying to score opiates. I honestly should stay away if possible. An hour later though and I'm back to writhing and call the nurse. The doc who breifly saw me earlier before being pulled away said give him some morphine. The nurse starts prepping an IV line.

She looks at my arm, sees the scaring, and says she's gonna go above it to avoid it. The cat is definitely out the bag now, but I don't care since I'm still getting the morphine. And I was thankful because it nearly instaneously brought me to normalcy. Cool, but I figure the mercy is up since it obvious to the staff now that I had drug addiction issues.

Nope, the doctor comes in and says they saw a stone, I'm getting a script until I see a urologist, and she even gave me a Norco to take there before I left. I was pretty amazed that I got narcotics after it was clear I had an IV drug abuse history. Especially in the current climate around pain meds today. It probably helped that I obviously was in pain and clearly did have stones, but I've heard some horror stories.

A sad and surreal aspect of the trip was a girl in the room next me was there on an OD. She'd been narcan'd and was alert, then she tried to just dip out the side. The nurses were arguing with her, saying she can get discharged but can't just dip. Then she did just dip after agreeing to stay. Then her boyfriend was calling threatening the nurses. They were all talking about security and what an asshole this guy is. Next there is someone on the phone talking about social workers on their way and the children of the girl. I was being wheeled out for my CT and could hear the staff saying something like, ""The younger daughter is happy, playful, and social, but the older daughter is showing signs....."" and then I was around the corner.",1529037518.0

I've been wanting to do this for a long, long time.  I have become acquainted with some of you throughout the years-some of which have been good experiences, some of which have been awful.  


I guess this is what we call a shitpost.  I really wish I had something meaningful to say.  I have been doing heroin for about four years now.  Its an on-again-off-again kind of thing, as I have never let my habit grow too large.  That being said I do go through stints of daily use.  These runs consist of somewhere between 1-3 bags of ECP daily, used in small quantities throughout the day.  Heroin gives me the motivation to accomplish tasks and be social, but it robs me of the human elements of life.  I may get more things done, but I am less thoughtful, and overall less creative.  I have been maintaining using Kratom recently which is a godsend, however I think it only works because my habit isn't too large.  I am working on quitting again, as I am sick the cycle that we all know too well.  I make good money, but I'm always running short by the end of the month.  I want to be a more balanced individual.  That being said the ups and downs of addiction hold their own attractions in a fucked up, twisted kind of way.  


I have tried going to meetings and therapy in order to stop using drugs.  I've been to hundreds of NA meetings but I'm just not sure that its for me.  Therapy was moderately helpful, but I found myself lying to my therapist so I concluded it was a waste of time.  Like I said earlier, Kratom has really been the most helpful thing for me.  After finding Kratom, I have become a huge advocate for maintenance therapy.  Every opiate addict deserves to have a maintenance option, and in my ideal world, this would come at no cost to them.  Maintenance is truly lifesaving, and from a societal and financial point of view is 100&#37; justifiable.  


Lastly I just want to say that I am very self conscious that most of my sentences start with ""I"".  It makes me feel very self-centered and selfish.  Shoutouts to all the contributors to this subreddit and the internet at large, as it is actually pretty difficult to write a post.  There is a lot of uncertainty about what to say and the format is so free-form!  You really have to think about what you want to say.  Anyways hope everyone has a good night, good day, good life!

I‚Äôve been slamming since 2014, with a year of rehab sandwiched in between, and occasional trouble aside (related more to hydration than anything else), my arms have been pretty reliable thanks to 31 gauges & daily rotation. 

I urged him to try harder to hit his arms but he insisted that his neck was the only way. 

It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve never seen this sorta shit before, it‚Äôs just that the people Ive seen hit there are like 10-20 year veterans. 

I‚Äôm not here to criticize anyone that hits their neck, cuz I know that limited access to fresh rigs will wreck veins in a hurry, but I just wanna know, how long before you made the transition? Be it ankles/neck/legs/etc.

& is it true that, I‚Äôm terms of a rush, neck > arm veins?

I started floating regularly, 2-3x a month, about a year ago and its changed my life for the better in so many ways. There have been times where 90 minutes in the tank feels like it peels layers of shit off of my brain and I'll come out of there with literally no internal monologue for upwards of 1 day. Not to mention the water / salts work wonders physically as well

Anyway I've foolishly prided myself on chipping for years and never using long or hard enough to get sick. Well, after a week of 180+ mg OC a day, combined with 40mg of Opana a day for the second half of said week... I felt pretty shitty when the fun ran out. My WD was very very mild, I had been through much worse, but after one rough day I got in the tank and the next day I woke up and felt totally re-set / refreshed.

I think in intense, long-habit acute WD it'd probably be very very tough to sit still in a tank for 90 minutes. but for anyone in PAWS looking to break up the monotony of not using and feeling dull, or for anyone in MILD wd... give it a shot (although its not the cheapest ""cure"" out there)

TLDR; if you began withdrawing the syringe from the vien, while still releasing small volumes of liquid-- leading sayyyy 0.05ml of fluid to accumulate between the skin and vien (during its exit). am i in any sort of danger? everything was sterile to OCD or medical standards




I wont upload pics cos im too paranoid for that.

however-- being right handed, i tried to inject into the crook of my left forearm; but got scared and pulled it out (no blood entered the syringe like i thought was supposed to happen, however after removing it-- it was obviously a vein bleeding). turns out the 30g syringes i have are quite hard to draw on with one finger...

so i retried on the other arm, with my less synchronized left-hand... I think as i began pulling out the shot my thumb was still on the plunger and so a small amount of liquid continued to be released as the needle was being withdrawn.

it was initially a bit red, but thats subsided a fair bit-- what is petrifying me is this very small lump above the vein. less raised than most pimples, and skin coloured.

it is very small-- but could this be an abcess???? please tell me im over reacting. I believe a very small amount of fluid was left between the skin and the vein. the small lump has a yellowish tinge to it (not unlike the liquid in the syringe), and the surrounding area just seems mildly blotchy

Seems to me like it would likely set me back, but it also seems sort of like a long taper. I realize it may extend withdrawal a little, but at this point 1 night of sleep may be worth it if it doesn't start me over completely. If I don't, I'll probably go until day 6 or 7 without sleeping.

I've decided i'm going to quit again (and I always do, the problem is for how long...)

Anyways, to end this binge i've got 15 sealed sterile needles (30g, 1/2 inch needle length) which I plan to use over 5 days at 3 doses a day. I only bought 5 sterile mixing cups (the metal ones you get from needle exchanges instead of spoons)

So for question number 1; Would it be bad IV practice to use the same mixing cup/'spoon' everyday while changing filter and syringe for every dose? (I.e cooking aparatus replaced once daily, rigs and filters replaced after every use-- 3x daily)

they said the sterile spoons were for one time use-- but i suspect they say this to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, I use alone so this is a non-issue. I don't see how reminants of water, heroin and vitamin-c will lead to a blood borne infection, at least not over the period of a single day

My second question is-- I am obviously going to start **low**, If say-- my first dose was *too* low, could I retry again with that same needle? assuming of course i hit the vien on the first try every time (i *was* a bodybuilder, but remain very lean and vascular-- my arms are naturally tourniqued so i cant imagine missing one of my fat viens). I know syringes blunt with every time they penetrate the skin-- but surely it is not necessary to throw it away after a single insertion? we are talking a 2nd attempt MAX here, so that i dont risk an OD (and once i know my dose, this wont be necessary). I do not wish to experience any scarring whatsoever, ive got alchohol swabs and the lot and am being very medicinal/OCD about this. Would a 2nd attempt leave a scar?

I know certain spider bites can really fuck you up so that's definitely a possibility. I'm going to find a doctor tomorrow if I wake up and nothing has changed.

So, I'll do my best not to rant too long here, but brevity and I rarely see eye-to-eye, so let me go ahead and apologize for the length.  First ever post on reddit.  I've lurked this forum for roughly a year now, and I feel like I know a number of you, though I obviously don't.  I didn't even make this account until a few months back, thinking I would post then, but you know, fear and anxiety, so it goes.

I've used for roughly 17 years now.  Cut my teeth on the old school 80s, things went from there as they tend to do.  I've had fairly sizable daily habits in the past, but I don't get to indulge too much these days.  The old back and forth of a handful of days sober, only to end up caving in and doing more.  Which of course wouldn't make sense to a lot of folks, but I know I don't have to explain that around here.  But yeah, my tolerance is pretty low these days, which is good, but I never seem to stay clean long enough to feel much stronger, mentally or physically.

Anyway, much love to all of you folks.  Seriously, I know you get a decent amount of posts like this, because I've read quite a few myself.  I keep wanting to try to put myself out there in some way, and well, I know I'm never going to do it if I don't just fucking do it.

I used to love to write, though it doesn't happen as much these days.  More inane ranting than anything.  I've lost a lot of things I've written over the years, whether it be poems/songs/stories/etc.  I always preferred the pen and pad, but after a certain point, I started typing things more often.  This was the main reason I would inevitably lose things, via hard drive crashes and the like.

I had a bit of a story written at one point, one that I really liked where it was going, even though I wasn't quite sure where I was taking it.  I ended up losing it, but tried to recreate it years later.  Naturally, we're always our own worst critics, but I don't think what I have now is as good as what I once had.  Then again, that's how life goes, eh?  Nostalgia is arguably the most intriguing emotion of all.  And, in the words of Oscar Martinez, time is a son of a bitch...

To try to begin to wrap this up, after finding a few things that I had written or rewritten over the past few years, I wanted to share something here.  Something heartfelt, though possibly trite.  I could go further into the origin of the story, but it's probably much less interesting that letting you interpret it as you will.  I didn't expect this part of the post to go on for so long, but I am mildly buzzing right now, and extremely bored, so there's that.  Regardless, if you're still reading at this point, all the love in the world to you.  And even if you aren't still reading, hey, that's understandable.  I genuinely hope you're all doing as well as you can be, whether stone sober or nodding like a motherfucker.) <3

It was a dark and rainy night.  Water cascading off of the windshield, reflecting light in the loveliest of colors.  Your eyes glowing as they met mine, assuring me I was fine.  You had me convinced we were looking through the same set of eyes, though you always seemed to wear your emotions as a disguise, I wasn't privy to this information at the time.

It's hard to blame you, though you clearly had plenty of faults, it's not as though we both didn't.  We had wonderful conversations that night.  Of blue flowers and wooden coffins, of how things could only improve from here.

It felt like you believed in me.  Fuck, you made me believe in myself, a more difficult task than I wish it were.  Bombarded by waves of various emotions, we smiled seas and cried oceans.  You touched my face as we kissed, you held me as I stroked your auburn hair.  We shared bowls and smokes, all while watching as the moonlight cheered us on from afar. 

I thought we would take on the world, you and I.  But it really didn't matter, you were becoming my world.  Obsession can be deadly, yet also weirdly necessary.  I felt at peace for the first time in my life.  It was a dark, rainy, beautiful night...",1528955302.0

My question is for those who can successfully chip. How often do you use and how often do you take breaks? Has anyone ever suffered full blown knock down drag out addiction, bounced back, and then was able to manage their usage in a way that they can use off and on essentially chipping for a substantial amount of time with confidence they're not going to get themselves back into full blown addiction?

Love you all first of all, this is just a quick post I had to make or well, I feel I had to make.

So, in withdrawal as I have been plenty of times before over the past 4-5 years of my addiction (on and off, 2 rehabs you get the jist) I currently am on day 2, and I sit here with massive amounts of goosebumps while I sweat the goosebumps keep on happening over and over. Of course, cold sweat. Not fun.

I sat there and realized I am just sitting here watching TV as If I normally would be doing, if I was high; but alas I am not high I ran out 2 days ago. Fire heroin, DNMs, expensive shit. Well, as I sit here with goosebumps I realize my emotions are all here, right now. My senses are back, its hard to explain but ya'll know what I mean it's like you walk outside and everything is heightened sounds smells etc (esp. b/c I sniff, probably) the smells are insane its weird pizza even smelt overwhelming earlier as you guys know this is what withdrawal is like; and it feels shitty for the most part of course.

But, why not just enjoy this time that I have right now while I have my emotions? It's an awesome thing, even though I feel like shit. Music sounds amazing, it's like I realize what the fuck I had not been enjoying music the past 6 months or so I have been using for fucks sake its orgasmic. 

I know when I got clean the last time, it was like that too for me. But any of my fellow opiate lovers do this? Like, shit the emotions are here right now, enjoy it before you pick up again. 

I am probably going to have dope tomorrow, so why not enjoy the moments I have with my emotions back for now since I know I'm just gonna use again as I am not in the mindset to stop right now. 

Weird thought I guess, because feeling like shit may overpower the willpower to even try to feel ""good"". We all sit and loathe during withdrawal I feel like- or at least I just was until I realized fuck I am wasting precious energy as my soul is here right now whereas when I am high it's kind of like I am a ghost in a shell. 

I also notice I laugh my fuckin ass off at random shit as if I am manic, due to the heightened emotions and senses. And it does feel good.. so try and laugh if you're on day 2 like me.. <3

I keep myself very occupied but slipping into a strong nod is all I can really hope.
Is it possible I‚Äôm just not ready to quit? I‚Äôve maintained a lot of sober time willingly it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm out on the street looking for it and I‚Äôve made a lot of progress on myself as a person but I just want some opiates for fucks sake. In reality am I bound to relapse because I have maintained such frequent thoughts and cravings through a long period of sobriety? I feel like I haven‚Äôt hit that rock bottom a lot of people need before they realize it‚Äôs time to get sober. Other than suffering with mental health and addiction I kept up good grades in school, stayed out of trouble, kept up a friend group, have a girlfriend I just didn‚Äôt like being dependent on anything for so long but I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm psychologically ready to give up opiates for good. 
TL;DR Been sober for a long time, still have cravings even though I‚Äôve been productive and occupied. Do you need to hit a rock bottom before you‚Äôre really ready to stay sober for good?",1528937950.0

8qxgfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8qxgfw/cravings/,38,https://redd.it/8qxgfw,chasingd0pamine,cravings -,"But not for opiates. I've been massively craving meth these days. The first time I tried meth, I smoked it and went on a 3 day bender that included no sleep or food. It was great, and I totally saw the appeal. But I didn't really fall in love until my first time IVing it. 

It was a Saturday night, my ex and I were at Walmart. I wanted to steal another TV to trade to our dealer for some dope. We'd already traded the 43"" smart TV I boosted. My ex (let's just call him T for story's sake) was ready to go home but my degenerate junkie ass was not having it! Let's just try one more store, I got this! Sure, OK. So we are standing outside the store before going in so T could smoke a cig. He's chatting with some employee that's outside on a smoke break. Out comes your stereotypical homeless junkie lookin' dude. Within a minute he mentions beans. Beans?! T and I lock eyes with that devious grin. *beans are capsules of heroin in the Midwest, just to clarify*. So T is the smooth talker out of us both and when it comes to manipulating in the drug game, he takes the cake. Within minutes the three of us are in our truck, giving this random dude, Juice, a ride home in exchange for a bean each. 

Except we never actually take him home. Once we realize he has slew of drugs on him, we push things a bit like the junkies we are. T and Juice bullshit back and forth for a bit, I add in my charm wherever needed. T butters him up some and it wasn't long before Juice pulls out like two grams of shard and lets us try some. We ended up spending the next twelve hours with this random dude, and going through the entire bag of meth. But that first shot is what really stands out in my memory. I'd considered snorting it, but we had rigs on us and I was feeling impulsive and had never banged it before. 

I disregard T telling me not to go too hard and prep up a fat shot, shaking in excitement at getting to try IVing it. I hand T my loaded rig, as I didn't know how to hit myself yet. I wrap the phone charger cord around my arm to tie off, and hold my arm out across the front seat. I look away, still squeamish about needles and blood (when in just a few weeks I'd be relentlessly poking myself with hooked needles and bleeding everywhere). Despite being in a dark car, T hits me on the first try - as always, he was a pro at hitting himself and others. Immediately I'm hit with a rush I'll never forget. I wanted to puke. I wanted to talk a million words per minute. I wanted to move. I wanted to do everything. I wanted to feel like this forever.

I'm over a month clean from heroin, almost never crave it, but god damn do I want some meth. ",1528935719.0

We are opening our first detox facility, and seeing that California just legalized medical marijuana, we want to be one of the first facilities to offer CBD Oil as a service to help with the detox process because of its awesome effects in helping the body through various symptoms. We know a lot of users are tired of the conventional treatments for substance abuse detox, and we truly believe CBD oil will be a safer, healthier alternative!

How likely would you be to admit yourself to a detox facility if it offered CBD oil/edibles/water/aromatherapy as one of it's services to aid the detoxification process? Is this a particular aspect that would interest you? Or maybe, would it discourage you from admitting yourself? Do you think your significant other/family member would admit you if they saw CBD oil was an option at our facility?

For the last year or so he's been snorting about 90mg Oxycodone approximately 3\-8 times a month, with the last three weeks being more like 2\-3 times a week.

So I bought 6, 8/2 suboxone strips. It's hard to recall exactly how I tapered.

Day 1: 8mg

Day 2-4: 4mg

Day 4-5 (maybe 6): 2mg

Day 6-9: 1mg

I have a lot of sub left if needed but I want to get it out of my system. I have been exercising a fuck ton and getting sun to stay sane. My big problems are sleep (sweating as fucking / insomnia) and anxiety (I got a panic attack at work the other day and cried).

Tools left:

Xanax (taken about .75mg at most, 6mg total in detox, usually for sleep)

Gabapentin (I try to take 600mg but doesn't seem to do much, have a fuck ton left from last rehab)

Ambien (haven't used)

Clonidine (haven't used, when do I use this?)

Caffeine (energy drinks to wake up for work, 80-160mg caffeine)

Thc

CBD (seperate from THC): I use sometimes but idk if it does much

Melatonin (used once)

I wish I had trazodone, valium or phenobarbital, and flexeril/soma... I could look on craigslist for kpins or valium, doubt I'd find the others.

Weed is really hard for me to stop and provokes anxiety so I want to stay away but I have used some.

Today I woke up and had chills / diarrhea but could be from a good sleep (xanax/gabapentin) after lots of days at work and insomnia.

With that said, I come to this community to seek help in composing a withdrawal cheat sheet or FAQ sheet. This will not be your ordinary cheat sheet that contains tips on how it will help the user get through it; we have those on here and other parts of the internet. What I am looking to help create is a sheet that is for your friends, family, significant others, etc. (read: people who have never been through it), to use and help understand what exactly is going on during WDs. It can be something as basic as a do & do not list of things that they (non-users) can refer to in order to help out the person who is sick. 

It does not need to be a peer-reviewed medical journal, and I think it would be best to keep it short and concise. Maybe it can cover:

What is going on physically

What is going on mentally

A basic timeline explaining how long it would take each set of symptoms to subside

What to do to help

What NOT to do to help

When to seek real professional help (I'm thinking call 911 type of help, not treatment)

This thought just crossed my mind because I am about to do a home detox and want to make it as easy as possible for all parties involved. I have been through it enough to know what to expect and all that shit, but this list is for people who do not have a ton, or any, WD experience. Feel free to add or remove items from my list, or downvote this to hell because it is stupid. I don't care. This is a throwaway anyway.

My longest running was nicknamed ‚ÄúCoffin Nail‚Äù) from a random spot in the bushes I had thrown it the previous night. Could NOT be bringing that onto my property with the way my parents are. I continue walking out this little country backroad as I‚Äôm staring at my phone waiting for the call from Dan or Dillon that they are pulling onto my street. I listen to Burrough‚Äôs Junky on audiotape from youtube (and about how his maid said opium brought sweet dreams. That sounds better than the oxymorphone nightmares), and suddenly the phone rings. it is them. ‚ÄúHey man get to the graveyard to meet us quick, Dillon has a credit card we can use to turn into cash. You can figure out how, right?‚Äù. Oh fuck.. How am I gonna do this? Of course I would figure it out but OF COURSE I can‚Äôt rightly say how either. Nonetheless, one could likely wonder how I ended up in this position, so let‚Äôs get back to that for a second.


[drug den 2.0, 8PM june or april(?)]

It was a calm day in April as I stood within a small 5x10 laundry room with bleach, appliances and every single thing you would need to shoot up some little rubber pills. I wondered to myself‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way you can IV these things. I‚Äôve seen the threads on bluelight. This will fucking kill you‚Äù. I kept thinking and realized I ultimately didn‚Äôt care. It was just once, right? I wanted to feel that rush, damnit! I was just a young drug aficionado who wanted to push that limit time after time. Dillon has this stupid fucking smirk painted upon his face and nothing could change it. He was filled with glee regarding the damage I was about to instill upon myself. It was actually quite morbid now that I think about it. Dan on the other hand had the blankest expression I have ever seen. If I were not a man of logic and reason I would tell you that his eyes were pitch black that day. That is how they looked anyhow.

He reached for the fresh pack of insulin syringes in the cupboard above and tells Dillon to fetch some warm water from the kitchen. ‚ÄúMake sure it‚Äôs fucking warm this time!‚Äù, Dan insists. I watch him carefully dip the pill, wipe the coating on his worn, old red long sleeves and stick a quarter of a yellow E series opana 40mg onto an aluminum foil tray he made. He turns on a nearby toaster (the fuck is that doing here?) and begins to let it warm up. ‚ÄúOh.. you have to cook these by the way‚Äù, he just now tells me. I knew it would be a rough process but not this rough. Okay, I‚Äôll survive. They have so far, right?

Before I know it, the pill is mixed atop a coca cola can (bottom side up) into the gross, black and brown amalgamation which was thicker than the sweetest honey this side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I see Dan bite off the end of a cig filter (sweet, more lack of sterility for me to cringe at. Ahh.. how things would soon change) and throw it into the mix. He begins to draw up this honey into the orange tipped insulin syringe. ‚ÄúHold out your arm‚Äù, he says. I hold up my arm, shaking all over from nerves. How would it feel, I wonder. He says I will feel a poke just as the doctors say. I feel it, but it isn‚Äôt bad. I kinda liked it already. I now actually turn my head towards him to watch how he does it. I‚Äôm not squeamish anymore. I noticed the little tiny sea of red blood rush into the brown moat of oxymorphone solution. Uh oh‚Ä¶ this is it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in..‚Äù, says Dan. I watch as he slowly but steadily pushes down the plunger, and I‚Äôm already feeling it‚Ä¶

It begins in my forehead, like an exotic kiss from the ghost of all my past loves combined. It was so warm and inviting, so quick and powerful. So natural, so real and delightful. It felt like meshing souls with the gods (or demons). I felt my body go completely numb with euphoria and I was sitting on flowers. I was wrapped so tightly in the opiate blanket I couldn't move much at all. I was back in the womb again, but it looks like the forest from alice in wonderland. Everything has a feint glow to it. Colors are much more vibrant. Everything is now soft to the touch, no pain or discomfort could see its way through this chemical Wall of China. I remained blissfully trapped in this little wooden kitchen chair, in the back of some old ladies home, a legit drug den. All my anxieties and all my fears, all my hesitation about the thoughts of my peers and family,  were all gone now. I look up with glossy eyes and a similar shit-eating smirk as Dillon had earlier. ‚ÄúHow is it‚Äù, they both say in unison. I muttered out, ‚Äúpretty fucking amazing. Everything I thought it would be and more...‚Äù This is it, I knew already in the back of mind. This is how I want to feel forever. 

I didn‚Äôt hang around long. Even while high as a fucking kite, I knew I had to get out of this bed bug infested home. My mom and I would both freak if we got them. I gave my appreciation as everyone‚Äôs mouth dropped that I was capable of getting up at all, let alone ride my bike home. This became a common theme with myself and my drug addict friends. They were always amazed at my natural inclination to ‚Äúhandle my shit‚Äù. Maybe it was simply a natural tolerance. I‚Äôm not quite sure still but it applied to all types of drugs. I floated down the brick steps under the glass sliding door connect this den to the outside world. We would usually sneak in this way as to not bother the actual tenant of the home. She was chill with all us junkies hanging around apparently. She just knew we would be dead or in jail otherwise I guess. I hop on my 250$ mountain bike that is supposed to be shared with my mom. She never uses it though. It has become my daily driver for my drug missions. It really sucks in a town with not enough sidewalks, and drunk/high rednecks swerving all over the pothole infested and cracked road. 

I did not even care tonight. I couldn‚Äôt see well, but my instinct was guiding me home. Home was my happy place, and on my peaceful bed I would always meditate. (Ever gone into a meditative state while high on IV opiates? It is bliss and even better than just the typical nod. I told myself I was repairing all the damage I had done to my brain. Ha, yeah‚Ä¶)

I glide down the sidewalk beside the bank at warp speed but to me it feels like slow motion. My pupils were pinned and my eyelids were so heavy I can barely keep them open long enough to see I‚Äôm on the pavement. I continue downhill past the funeral homes, dollar stores, prostitutes and pharmacies which now dominate this small town. I pass the government living buildings in downtown, which I normally don‚Äôt like biking past due to sketchiness of the road AND the people. However, on this night, bring it on. I was one of them now. They all loved me. Just show them your fresh track marks! Shit is like a badge now. I was feeling all chill about it on the ride home, and for the rest of the night as I crawled up in bed after meditation and threw on some adventure time. 

I remember shutting off all my lights and barely cracking my door, implying I‚Äôm asleep. No way I wanted to deal with my parents now. I doze in and out for a few hours in a blissful haze similar to the time I sniffed some heroin but a lot stronger. There was literally no way for me to stay awake long like this. The pull of my bed‚Äôs comfort was in its prime state. A state only achieved with chemical influence. I go to bed for a presumably dreamless night, but if I did dream it was probably already about shooting up. 

In the morning I awoke, and everything was normal for a brief moment. I look around and stretch, when I see it. A big nasty bruise and red puffy lump on the crook of my left arm from the needle‚Äôs bite. I feel an extremely intense feeling of disgust wash over me like all the litter in the ocean just came and I bathed in it. 

I felt like scum, and I was never gonna do that again‚Ä¶

First tried Opiates when I was 14. It was cool back then. Spent a few years taking them on occasion. Then occasionally used throughout post hs years.

Found a plug that let me get 100 mg tram  2/1$ and got myself hooked in college. The plug and I disagreed on something and we broke ties. I found a new plug to get me oxy at .50-1$/mg. This was great because I had enough money to buy about 60-90 pills (10mg and 15mg) a week and was functioning perfectly.

Eventually that plug claimed to sell me some pink 10s (never played me before) and I had a bad feeling about it. Anyway she hands me some pinks and I drive off. The letters appear to be scratched off but I didn‚Äôt think TOO much about that bc the bitch was a junkie herself and she‚Äôs never played me before. Long story short they were fake pills and when I called her back she blocked me and I had no way of contacting.

Then went to another guy who charges outrageous prices for oxy but none the less got myself hooked on 30s to the point where I need them every couple hours to function and feel normal. If they were less expensive and more accessible I wouldn‚Äôt have this problem.

I‚Äôm considering going on methadone therapy to let myself chill and rewire my brain to function without oxy and hydro. I also understand that a lot of you would consider this a light habit in comparison to H and other things. For me it‚Äôs a problem because it‚Äôs draining all of my money.

I'm a doctoral student in sociology at NYU, where I research missing persons.

As part of my research, I‚Äôm trying to learn more about how and why people end up listed as missing, which isn't very well understood by either academics or law enforcement. To that end, I'm currently interviewing people who have formerly been classified as missing, either formally or informally, for a peer\-reviewed academic paper.

I‚Äôm posting here because, anecdotally, I‚Äôm finding out that a significant number of people who end up missing are dealing with opiate addiction. This keeps coming up in interviews with families of the missing, as well as in social media posts about missing persons cases. I'd really like to learn more about this, as there‚Äôs virtually no research on this topic.

If you were ever a missing person, even for a short time, I'd love to hear more about your experience. If you're interested in participating, please fill out the form below. All interviews are confidential. And, if you have any questions, I can be reached by DM.

And please feel free to share this with others!

I live with my parents house because it was the last place I could go, and if I get thrown out of here, I will literally have nowhere to go (not an exaggeration). My plan is to claim that I got addicted to pain pills that were prescribed by my former doctor (he abruptly closed his practice last week). So, my question to you guys is what would be the best pain pill to say I was prescribed and now no longer have access to, that resembles dope the most? What I mean by that is which type of pills have the same length and type of WD that dope has. I haven't done painkillers since the days when you could get IR OC 80s very easily, so I am a bit dated. This is my last ditch effort to save whatever relationship I have left with my parents, and in their mind, getting addicted to a pill from a doctor is a lot different than getting addicted to ECP.

So hey everyone I'm  on methadone now but when I was a user I used both bth and ecp a lot. Bth was always cheaper and felt more of tucked up high where eco felt more clear headed, but both could make you nod.  I also preferred tar because less likely to be cut with fent and I loved the taste when smoked. Tasted like bbq. A huge benefit bth has over ecp is if you're caught by someone besides police you can play it off as hash. 

ECP was stronger most of the the time. The strongest  bth I ever did was not as strong as the best ecp I ever did.  I felt tar had more legs too, but also a worse withdrawal.  

Also to anyone who has had #3 as well as bth and ecp could you compare.

I was prescribed it for the off label use of anxiety/depression after a year of trying 7 different meds, therapy and TMS. I pulled my back and was prescribed a narcotic and was told by the urgent care doc to stop taking it as there may be some negative interaction. I then proceeded to have some of the best sleep I‚Äôve had in a while for two days, but then shit got real. 

I starting taking Gabapentin around November and loved it. I just as quickly started developing sleep issues but didn‚Äôt make the connection. The medication was taken consistently with 2/3 days of misuse just to see what it did (damn you Google) but for the most part taken as directed, 3x100 mg daily. Around Jan I started taking 300 mg all at one time, I don‚Äôt remember why. Beginning of Feb I started taking it sporadically as I started to feel the best I had felt in over a year, me thinking it was because of a much needed career change and TMS therapy.  I was on the road to mental health recovery and didn‚Äôt want to be on meds anymore. But around mid Feb I started developing body tremors and sleeplessness. Staying up late because I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep but then sleeping 7/8 hours, no big deal, as I was not working and could sleep in if I needed to. But then I would fall asleep then wake up about wouldn‚Äôt be able to go back to sleep for hours. Plus I started having stomach issues and gained 10lbs in about 5 weeks. I got checked for thyroid issues and leaky gut, both negative. I also went and had blood work done and checked for vitamin deficiencies, still waiting to hear on those. But I finally made the connection that it was because of the Gabapentin. 

Some other notes. My symptoms: bloating, stomach pain/organ swelling, insomnia, mild anxiety, internal body tremors/heart palpations, throat fluttering, occasional headache, weight gain. I have tried everything for relief over the last few months. Valerian root, CBD oil, pancreatin, turmeric w/black pepper, gaba supplement, thyroid therapy (hypo), thyroid calming (hyper), otc sleep aids, trazadone, magnesium citrate, and now magnesium orotate, lemon balm, lemon grass, B12 and biotin vitamins. They all (except hypo thyroid supplement) knock me out the 1st day and then palpations come back with a vengeance the next day and then bye bye blessed sleep. 

I‚Äôm on day 12 of the withdrawal and it does get better daily, but that first week is a bitch. The exhaustion and not knowing what‚Äôs wrong with you is overwhelming and I could barely function and was incredibly irritable. Thankfully not too much anxiety. Now knowing what the problem is and lessening of symptoms makes this bearable but it still sux.  My stomach pains, and bloating went away, I did adapt a healthier vegetable, fruit, low carb diet, and added probiotics tabs, komucha, and yogurt cut out fatty fried foods and junk, etc. I‚Äôve lost 2 lbs, since my back prompted this so that‚Äôs awesome. Now I‚Äôm just trying to figure out the sleep as I‚Äôm getting 1\-3 hrs, sometimes at one, or spread out throughout the night.

I‚Äôm going to do a celery juice cleanse for 3 or 4 days maybe longer to detox my liver, as the palpations may be caused by a fatty liver. I also had a colonic on day 8 and plan to have 2 more to detox me. I‚Äôve also reduced my alcohol intake and plan to start working out as I was already 170lb at 5‚Äô4‚Äù.

I remember coming off of Effexor and thinking that that was horrible. That was a cake walk comparatively, the brain zaps lasted for about a month after the last dose.  I didn‚Äôt have to take anything more than a multivitamin and magnesium and I could sleep. Right now I‚Äôm just taking the gaba, b12, biotin, magnesium orotate and turmeric. Hopefully I‚Äôll be able to sleep soon.",1528893776.0

I woke up at 11am to walk down to the hood as my dealer wakes up around 11:30 every day. As I walked up to the gas station I saw him turning in before I even called him, so I took out my $20 to cop my 5/10 gunpowder. (FML... it's been so underwhelming lately, but where else am I gonna go with a $20 bill) I'm thinking my luck is gonna be good.... grab the cap, and head to McDonalds.

Go into the stall. Now, my fucking rig is stuck. It sucks being in Florida as it is SO difficult to get a rig I end up using the same one over and over again and trashing my veins. So I start trying to lube up the plunger and finally succeed. Get some water into my hand and draw it up.... *fuck. My cap was in that hand.*

So now I have this squishy fucking cap and I cant open it so I just put the entire cap into the spoon with water and start trying to dissolve it. I'm starting to really sweat now and I'm sick out of my mind so I all I can think of is getting this shot together. I can't find my filter for like 2 minutes. Finally, I draw up the dark liquid up from this MESS in the spoon. Sit down on the toilet. Can't find a fucking vein.

Well, I'm digging around, digging around.... when I MUST HAVE NOT LOCKED THE DOOR RIGHT, BECAUSE AN OLDER GUY WALKS RIGHT INTO THE FUCKING STALL WITH ME. He stares DIRECTLY at my heroin syringe in my arm and goes ""Jesus fucking Christ!"" and FAINTS right there. Like are you fucking kidding me? What the FUCK am I gonna do now? And on top of that, I can't just put my spoon away, because it has a mess of cap and dope on it.... maybe like 30&#37; of the cap that I couldn't draw up.

In comes another guy. He sees the guy passed out on the floor, I'm struggling to put all my shit away but my spoon is still on the baby changing table and this guy is passed out preventing me from closing the stall door. This guy manages to get the old guy up, who proceeds to yell ""He's shooting heroin in there!"" To everyone in the store. Some innocent bystander is like ""I have narcan in my car!"" Amidst images of a mob of customers holding me down and forcibly narcanning me, I start running.

Past few months I have pretty curious as to trying opiates. I know it's not the best thing to be curious about, but the past year I have really been experimenting with new substances. Tried my first psychedelic, smoked weed for the first time, and even tried cocaine just a few weeks ago.

Just some background as to who I am as a person. (Not sure if this will help to what I am getting at, but possibly someone can relate or understand?) I'm 19, college student, and pretty depressed. I am actually writing this post as I am doing my calculus homework for a summer course that I am taking. Past years have been pretty brutal mentally. I think this is a big reason as to why I started dabbling into drugs; just to maybe give me some type of happiness. From a past post about heroin, one part that stuck out to me was how content the person was. I can't recall the last time I have been content and overall satisfied with anything. Here are my two questions:

What made you start using opiates?
Do you regret using them?

Im just curious and also do yall think I should just cold cop and do a tiny shot to test it because I heard that just a grain of fentanyl is enough to kill you.

Don‚Äôt write it off just because of a few horror stories. 


I was an heavy opiate user for about 4 years or so. It started like many other people‚Äôs stories with prescription opiates, namely norcos, morphine pills and Roxies, but quickly turned to BTH when my pill habit got too crazy. After a couple run ins with the law, constantly disappointing my family and a terrible car accident that happened under the influence (luckily I only injured myself and no one else by my stupid actions) I finally decided to get clean. I went to an outpatient suboxone treatment program and therapy to help get my head on straight and try to live a normal life. I‚Äôm currently in my 10th month of sobriety using suboxone. I have a great full time job, the trust of my family, no more debt and a much better outlook on life. And I have all of this because of the great outpatient program I‚Äôm in and suboxone. 

The reason I‚Äôm making this post is because I know that some people in recovery look at suboxone as either the devil or not being truly clean. And yes, while I am still taking an opiate drug, it is nothing like taking a drug to get high. I literally don‚Äôt feel anything from my suboxone, it simply keeps me from going through withdrawals and from constantly craving opiates. It allows me to wake up and live a normal life while thinking clearly as opposed to the mental fog induced by drug use. Suboxone really is a wonder drug for opiate addicts and I think the stigma around it should be seriously scrutinized due to the fact that suboxone has worked for so many people. The only caveat to this is you need to find a suboxone treatment program that does it right. Some programs definitely prey on vulnerable people and simply try to get them to switch to suboxone and stay on it forever for monetary gain. They don‚Äôt offer things like therapy or counseling to help a person understand why they started using to begin with and then giving them the tools to deal with these things in a health way. They don‚Äôt offer any help other than a prescription. However, there are many more programs that do offer these things and I believe that, in conjunction with suboxone, therapy and counseling can help a person truly overcome addiction. I guess what I‚Äôm really trying to say is, don‚Äôt think that all suboxone programs are there to scam you. Some definitely are, but if you find the right one it can be life changing. If you‚Äôre looking to get sober, try to find a program that offers suboxone treatment and mental health counseling among other tools to help you stay sober. Another thing, try and find a program that has a taper schedule planned out from the beginning. My program is 2 years long, however it can be shortened if the patient shows significant improvement throughout the first year. I plan on starting my taper within the next 3 months and I don‚Äôt even have the slightest urge to use again. Idk, I just feel like this needed to be said. Suboxone really is a great tool for recovery and if you want to get sober, it is one of the best options us opiate addicts have. 

That‚Äôs all I really had to say. Don‚Äôt right off suboxone completely because of some of the horror stories you here. If you find the right program, it can be a god send. If anyone has any questions about anything I said or the program I‚Äôm in, just lmk. ",1528844879.0

I guess they‚Äôre kind of quick stories with questions attached. Thanks in advance for any helpful responses!

1) I brought my homie back from an OD over Memorial Day with mouth to mouth resuscitation. EMT‚Äôs got there right as he woke up and gave him 2mg to be safe but I brought him back with only a few breaths. He fell out pretty hard though, completely stopped breathing, etc. None of that is very surprising or unusual, but the one weird thing was his jaw was clamped shut super hard. I have a dent in my thumbnail from trying to pry his teeth apart. Managed to somehow still get some air in him but I‚Äôve never really seen/heard of that before. I clench my teeth pretty often from anxiety/etc but I‚Äôve never been told that I did it during an overdose (I‚Äôve had a few too many).

Is that a common thing? If not, anyone else here seen/experienced that? Or know why it happens? Btw this happened immediately, it wasn‚Äôt like I found him that way, it all happened in front of me.

2) I‚Äôve been on subutex for 6 months, started with 8mg which got me feeling 100% better after going through pretty much full WD for about 5 days beforehand (from a .2-.5/day BTH habit). I‚Äôve been on and off the sub all year, usually 2-4mg/day or less, and never off sub/shooting dope for longer than maybe a week. 

I just got off about a two week run shooting dope the other day (think I dosed sub one day in the middle of it) and I started getting pretty sick about maybe 18 hrs after my last shot. I‚Äôve never put myself into PWD from sub but I‚Äôm not trying to risk it either, so I started with just a little bit of an 8mg tab. 

Didn‚Äôt get any sicker but didn‚Äôt feel any better either so I kept taking 1-2mg at a time until I‚Äôd taken 8mg without much relief to speak of. Only brought one with me bc I didn‚Äôt even think I‚Äôd need the whole thing, but I ended up having to bail on my friends and take the bus 2 hours to get home. 

When I got home I kept taking more sub and I still felt like shit. Finally got myself stabilized (mostly) after 24mg. I‚Äôve never had to take that much before! I was only shooting maybe .1-.2/day before that too. Next day I think I took a full 8, then maybe 4 yesterday. Didn‚Äôt feel like I needed any today, I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve taken probably 2mg and felt fine but I had a shot of dope (actually felt a .1 shot with that much sub in me but only for a minute, you know how it goes). 

So the question I guess is, anyone else have to take an insane amount of sub like that to get well after using such small amounts? I could see 16mg maybe but I was still totally sick until I got up to 24. Got right back down to my usual 2-4mg in a couple days afterward but that first sick day it took soo much to get well.

Anyways, both of us only smoke we don't snort or inject anything, even #4 EC powder.

I always did it this way and never thought otherwise. I just like the look of it, and the ritual of ""chasing the dragon"". My friend, however, creates a little crater toward the edge of the foil and drops his dose into it like a bucket on the end of a little stick. he lights it underneath it's location on the foil, per usual. 

My question: Is there any advantage to smoking dope off foil using one method over the other? 

I tried both and maybe I am oblivious because I don't know what I am looking for, but I didn't notice a difference. You could save a lot more tin foil if you didn't roll it across the entire foil like a roadway though...",1528833305.0

So I know opiates are a slippery slope I found myself in a bit of a shitty family situation...

my brother is doing 1-2 eightballs of coke a day and is lashing out at everyone, his boyfriend is cheating on him and when I tried to tell him this he kicked me out, which isn't bad but I am living with my ex girlfriend and best friend and now we are both displaced

My mom is in an open relationship with the ass hole I've seen her with for years, I've seen him hit her and attack her car with a crowbar and now she's okay with him fucking some other bitch. she just has to know everything that is going on. (A lot to digest)

My grandpa is bipolar and has a reputation of abandoning my grandmother who is a cancer survivor and a diabetic... the tension in my family has cause them to isolate themselves from everyone to the point where my grandpa has to throw temper tantrums on the phone screaming at people only to have him being very friendly upon walking through the door to greet him. my grandmother, has taken to drinking every night... to the point where she is passed out at the table, slurring her words as I say goodbye to walk home.

My father has been absent since he came out as gay when I was 11 and since then he has tried to live his own life and pretty much abandoned me and my brother to chase dick... now that I am in college for computer science (which I am paying for myself, which sucks because I cannot afford this next semester) thinks he can step in as the father figure after he lived off of my grandparents  (mom's parents) for the past 7 years rent free and now that he 's on his own he feels all  high and mighty and is trying to be my father. 

My ex girlfriend is a wonderful soul and I am so attached to her I don't want to even think about anyone else with her but I don't know if her and I want the same thing anymore.

My boss has heard how everything is going and is offering me a house that I can rent from him, because he sees a lot of himself in me and when I confronted my mom about it she says she doesn't want me to leave.

I've been dealing with substance abuse (benzos and opiates since I was a freshman) I've never been physically addicted before this long as bender... I can't remember if it was weeks or months since I went more than a few days without doing a line or popping a perc... 

This past week I realized when I wasn't using my 30's or sniffing cheese I was anxious as fucking and could not sleep and had bad RLS....

Opiates are the only thing that make me feel like I'm actually normal... I enjoy not having anxiety, or having ibs issues, not sweating, not second guessing everything I say, being confident, nor feeling like I'm freezing to death... but I'm at my 4th day clean. I'm over the worse part I think as I can get out of bed. thank god for clonidine and Robinul. I am scared I have ruined my ability to enjoy my DOC ever again. at such a young age. it's all my fault. I am beyond depressed and feel like I  let everyone down. my ex is horrified for me because I am in so much pain and lethargic and she is too naive to identify WD symptopms. 

how long will it he before I can use again without resetting this hell? I'm going to be clean for at least a month and working on my self control as well as coping mechanisms. when there is just so much going on it is just bliss to be able to sniff a 30 and be able to just focus on my job or class... any input is appreciated. thank you guys and gals so much...

But we all relate to being arrested or at the very least, avoiding cops because of the contents of our pockets! I just wondered if anybody has any thoughts about [the story in the UK from yeaterday.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/11/epileptic-boys-mother-barred-from-bringing-cannabis-oil-into-uk)


A mother was prescribed cannabis oil for her critically sick child with epilepsy. The seizures WILL kill him. But this oil made from the plant has altogether stopped the seizures and kept him well. Doctor in the UK prescribed it.. Doctor in Canada sold it because it is medicinal and legal. It was confiscated at the UK border because it contains a small amount of THC which is illegal. (It's mostly CBD if I remember rightly - the other chemical in weed that is not psychoactive, it won't get you high, but it helps with anxiety and other conditions - like epilepsy, obviously).

-

This has made me so angry. The war on drugs is fucking pathetic, outdated, unwinnable and has wasted lives, money, time and the progress against serious medical issues like depression, epilepsy, PTSD, addiction.. - All these things are strongly anecdotally aided by various illegal drugs (ketamine for depression, ibogaine/LSD for addiction, MDMA for PTSD, mushrooms for migraine and serious depression etc etc the list goes on and on) Yet science hasn't moved forward in more than 50 years because it's illegal to look at these substances, even in a controlled setting. The pharma industry could have developed non psychoactive versions of any of these drugs by now or worked out their method of action within the brain. Instead, we're decades behind because we've prohibited everything about them - which hasn't stopped a single person that ever wanted to do drugs, from ever doing them!

Drug dealers are like the Hydra. You cut one off, you get two spring up.
I've been sitting waiting for my dealer while reading the local paper about how 5 dealers were caught and sentenced in my city. One of them WAS my dealer. He said he was going to co to use making money until he goes to prison for under a year probably, but sell his phone with all the customers to so.eo e to take over. Not a single break in the chain.

-

Anyway. As we are discovering, one of these illegal drugs is also one of the most medicinal plants ever. (The hippies were right, who knew!).

From epilepsy to cancer. Change the balance of THC to CBD and you get great appetite enhancer for people struggling to eat after chemo.  Or anti anxiety.. Weed genuinely seems to be pretty miraculous for a number of serious conditions.

It's pretty much a certainty at this point. So,while we wait for the law to catch up. This mother may have to watch her son for because the law says this plant has incorrectly been deemed illegal and there is no talk of changing the law, despite the benefits. This story will hopefully bring more attention to the subject. But I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the government to make a positive change. They're scared shirtless to change drug policy and it's the most cowardly thing any of those politician fucks can do. **Science says 100% to do this... They won't because they're too scared of how they'll look in the eyes of their right wing supporters.  Meanwhile, BILLIONS in untaxed illegal drug currency flows out the country, people die due to science being unable to pursue any psychoactive a (See: 2016 COMPLETE BAN ON ALL PSYCHOACTIVE DRUGS, INCLYDING ONES THAR HAVENT BEEN INVENTED YET!

FYI, this idiotic law saw a 600% increase in hospital admissions because research chemicals were suddenly illegal, people had to turn to the street where they didn't know what they were getting or the dose. Jumping on a gap in the market, dealers started selling Spice - which then TOOK OVER the homeless community (endless news stories about it) with people dying, seizures and getting addicted to it with many addicts saying it is even harder to come off than crack and heroin)

For reference of my preferences: I really like oxycodone, and I really don‚Äôt like hydrocodone (It makes me sick more than anything).

(Hijack their connect),"So I just got back into the game after a good 6-8 month break but since I've been on break my dealer went into treatment. Well I've been trying to find a connect for a while and it didn't go very well in the beginning. First off, I was able to find a dude who was willing to help me out finding some good ECP (in my area it's actually hard to come by and more expensive). The only problem was he was charging me $20 extra which made half G's cost $90 bucks!! Wayyy to expensive but it was all I had access to and since my tolerance is so low, it lasted long enough where the $90 wasn't that big of a deal breaker.

 Well, of fucking course the jackass ends up robbing me (I gave him the cash and after 20 min of waiting he said he got pulled over and blah, blah, blah. I knew he was lying instantly because if you get caught with dope or rigs, since he was a shooter, you're going to jail and not for just one night because he hit me up the next day saying he'd ""get me back for the $90 eventually but if I wanted to grab again he could help me out""). So there goes that connection, luckily for the 2/3 weeks he helped me grab I was able to get 2 numbers from him. One was his ECP connect (got the number because one night he was sick and needed a point and I told him I'd only help if I could get the connect). Well he must have known his connect was changing numbers or something because that connect changed numbers like 4/5 days after I got the number (I was able to call the dude 2 days in a row but he just kept saying he didn't have any and he'd let me know when he did... after he asked 20 questions about how I got his number).

On to the main reason of this post... Well the other number I got was some chick who could help me find tar, but she wasn't a dealer, just a middle. I picked up with her a few times but she was the greediest middle ever. First time I grabbed they picked up the dope and shaved off 2 points of my half gram (I said **I** could break off at most a point for her but off course she  broke it off). Well, I decided to buy grams after that so I didn't have to break off as much for them (her and her bf) but of fucking course she wanted 2 points if I bought grams.

I argued with her about it but I couldn't do anything about it because I didn't have any connects yet so I had to deal with getting basically ripped off (especially considering I had to drive 40 min to her place, only to drive her and her bf 20 min back towards my crib where her connect was to pick up).

After 2 weeks of this shit.... constantly trying to get the connect from her, telling her I'd pay for it, etc .... I decide I need to get the connects number. The chick who was helping me would always have her bf come with us to grab and they would always keep telling me that ""you're not breaking off enough"" and would sit there until I gave them what **they** considered to be 2 points off my gram. Well, one day it was just me and the girl and we went to pick up at some restaurant.

This was my chance. I wrote my number on a note and slipped it into the cash... after I counted it out for her. The note read ""Yo, I've been going through Jane Doe for a month now but she's ripping me off. Here's my number, hit me up so I can buy straight from you"".

I didn't expect to hear back but literally 2 min later the chick got a text from her dude. I'm thinking ""oh fuck, I'm screwed"" but he just asked her if I was sketchy, if I'm cool, etc... She was sketched out wondering why he was asking questions and I just said it's probably because he saw me looking at him when you grabbed. Well, 2 min later I get a text from the dude saying I can buy straight from him now!! Later that day he asked if I broke her off some and I told him I always did (and not just a point, but upwards of 2 points).  I told him not to tell her I got his number a few times, and he said he wouldn't......lol

Well, later during the day my phone started getting blown up by the chick. Apparently she was trying to get the dude to give her a few points because she told him I didn't give her anything (which was BS because I gave her easily 2 points this last time because I got the dudes number and was like ""fuck it, here is the last dope you'll get from me"" lol). The connect messaged me and apologized because he told her that he knows I gave her a few points off that gram. So I have to go into damage control mode (just in case I need to grab from her again since she had a few connects)..... I told the chick I never talked to the dude and kinda convinced her that he was lying because ""how could I get his number?"" and ""he's probably just saying that so he doesn't have to break you off any"". Luckily, I also told her I was taking a break for a few weeks after I picked up (this is after I got the connects number, so I was essentially breaking it off with her) so hopefully she stops messaging me (she constantly hits me up asking if I want to pick up again.. Like less than 24 hours after getting a gram). 

FUCK yeah, I was so tired of all the BS I had to put up with going through  that chick and her bf. They were heavy users and that's one reason they were constantly asking me to break off more... to the point where a few times I honestly told them that I'm not giving them any more. As a bonus, I was able to haggle my prices down to $120 a gram (the chick was getting charged $140 because she would never ask for lower prices, and she would get points from her dude for bringing him business so she didn't give a fuck what someone like me paid).

Another bonus... This connect is only 20 min away and is legit. We talked a bit when I first grabbed from him and he hates the girl who was helping me out because she's such a fiend. She constantly tries to score points for bringing him $20 sales and his rule is 1 point for 1 gram sales.

TL;Dr
Chick who was middling for me was a fiend, asking for 1/5 of the dope i purchased. After putting up with her shit for a month I snuck my number and a note in the cash to her connect asking for him to hit me up. And it worked. Also, now I pay $20 less and don't have to drive extra to pick up.

Moral of the story: don't be a greedy middle because people will find a way around you (a point off a gram would have been cool with me and I would have continued to grab through her for a while, but asking for 1/5 of my bag is just greedy).",1528771917.0

Been on opiates for years like 150mg oxycontin , stopped that and now have been on oxycodone for 1 year nearly 2, at 20 mgs a day (5mg four times a day). I got pregnant and told my dr I wanted to stop very slowly as I still have chronic pain and if I even half my pill I notice withdrawals bad I'm not sure why. I get hot and sweaty and feel cramps I feel like absolute shit. 
My dear dr was away and will b all week so I decided to c someone else. Big mistake. This mole was cold and nasty looking I could tell when she called my name I'd made a mistake. I told her I'm due for my scripts and she said she can't give me my endone as it's not safe. I said I understand but I am weaning off it slowly and my dr is aware. She said no and no need to wean can just stop.... I said but I feel the withdrawal if I just stop and my dr said not to. She said oh well it's a small dose anyway and you will be fine take panadol. Um wtf? Im so upset she basically just made me out to be a dumbass. She told me to go to the hospital if I felt to sick.

2nd Edit: I called him. I said what money I had, he said he'd have the bag ready. He let me in, took the cash, handed me the bag and literally pushed me out saying I had to go. I've been ripped off by this guy, I've been going to him for literally my entire addiction. I don't consider myself a thief for this... I see it more like winning on a cheap scratch off. It was an exciting moment weighed it out 12 hours later seeing how great I made out. I don't know what to think, did he hook me up because he knew he was being a dick? He's hooked me up before so it's not all that far fetched but a whole gram? Okay, maybe. But this is his job. I buy enough to pay his rent. I needed this. I didn't hurt anyone to get it and if he was hurting for an extra gram that much, he wouldn't have had a mixup like that to begin with because he would be paying more attention.

Been chasing the dragon for a few years, am now a certified professional with virtually no wastage, can even do it all with one hand if given a lighter that has a lock mode. 

Problem: let's face it, it's not ideal. Amongst many drawbacks, i can think of the following:

a) it involves foil. Stories claim that it might be dangerous, other that it's an urban legend. Truth is, if you ever vaped meth from foil then from glass (oil pipe), you know it tastes 100&#37; better in the pipe. So why take the risk?

b) foil is noisy. Trying to unwrap your crumped up foil in the toilet, desperately insuring its fairly smooth while getting paranoid about smoke detectors is sub\-optimal to say the least.

c) it's not convenient. Spending time\-pre\-cutting sheets and stashing them in a book for easy access, carrying foil on you which makes 0 sense and might raise attention, having to buy 'just foil and a coke please at the supermarket' \- well you get my drift.

d) it's dirty. Oh yes, we've all been there, one false move and you touched the underside where the lighter was, voila, black fingers. Now you're trying to wash your hands, but just leaving the foil on top of the table made the table dirty... its' endless.

So... surely there's a better way. I know evidently i could just buy H4 but in the UK where i'm from, H4 is essentially 99&#37; of the time a fent analogue, and i love my life. Mainlining is not a step i wish to take at the moment, and i don't think needles are particularly much more convenient either.

I'm been thinking of carrying a glass surface and chase on that, leveraging a stronger heat source (torch lighter). The problem is that normal glass shatters easily, and the pyrex stuff doesn't come in thin enough, or flat enough containers to be convenient carried.

I've tried oil pipes (meth pipes), no dice, that's essentially either: a) wasting product as the heat is applied evenly to the whole of the product, wasting much of it by heating parts of it way too much, and other not enough, or b) essentially 'boiling it' over , creating a nasty, hyper heated fume that's as impossible as it is  dangerous to breath.

One thing i thought might have some legs is a metal cylinder, roughly 1cm wide, meaning wide enough to sprinkle h within, but also not wide enough to prevent using as an 'all in one device'. Sadly, i had little luck with this, as when i tried the H, if not evenly distributed, would evidently 'roll' and 'aggregate' within the pipe, and eventually either drop down on the floor, or ... dangerously make its way down towards my mouth.. no thanks. The idea came from how you can easily re\-heat any tooter and essentially burn the accumulated resin within it. I guess a mechanism by which little notch prevent the h to roll down when heated or accumulate too much in clumps is imaginable, but it would be rather... specialized hardware. 

I'm out of ideas, so if you have any and had luck with them, let us know! Bonus points if it involves an 'all in one (pipe\-like) device.
