Couple questions:

1) Why does dope come in powder and tar form? Is that decision up to whoever's making it? When is that decision made and why? Can you draw any conclusions on the origin of the dope based on whether it's tar or powder?

2) On a more personal note, smoking gives me a headache and no itching. Powder gives me itching but no headache. Anyone know why? 

3) What is tar usually cut with? And is there any way to guess the purity by look, smell, feel, etc? 

4) What about powder? What accounts for the different colors: some golden brown, some lighter? What is in the cut?

So ive been clean from a fairly heavy #4 habbit for a month now. As stated in a post asking about Tapentadol, I have the worlds greatest motivator to stay chipping and off the H. I'm just not prepared to let this beat me and not enjoy a nice opi high once or twice a month on pills, no H or fent. Yes, ive been here before but not with the motivation I currently have, so i know, I know - 1)I'll be straight back on the H 2)pills are overpriced; buy H... 3)oral ROA is a waste etc. Well time will tell.

Anyway, ramble aside today I thought fuck it ill try and catch a nice opi buzz for the first time in a month with the only opiate in my stash been an NHS 8mg sub, its bupe only, no naloxone. Its still in the blister and was from a very reputable vendor on a certain market place.

I have **never** tried bupe before, and im a month clean. I know tolerance never returns to baseline and I was getting through a few gramms of world class quality #4 a week at my worst, so im not exactly opiate niave. I took 2mg sub lingually, and then snorted about 1mg. This was about an hour ago with a very light breakfast consumed about 3 hours ago. I feel hardly anything, but i am fairly pinned. Wtf? I thought bupe the first few times of trying was supposed to give great nods? Should I try a little more?

So who spent the night alone/stayed home tonight?

This guy did. 
I copped 30 bags of some fire dope and a gram of some fishscale from my new plug in the suburbs. Holy shit this batch is fucking amazing. When this dude tells me to be careful I know it's about to be fire :) I still can't believe I'm getting even better dope in the burbs. Now my plug is a straight OG 4cornerhustler, he's like 45 haha. Dude is the definition of a  trap star. For real. The friend that introduced me to him said he has been constantly consistent for the last two years he's been going there. He never gotten subpar or even average quality dope, it's always the straight fire! My dope from my connects in the city was fire too but this shit is off the fucking chain (and only 15mins away vs the two hour round trip to the west side).

Ah, New Years is pretty depressing for me. Tonight should have been the three year anniversary with the love of my life. Unfortunately she couldn't put up with me doing dope anymore and left me 6months ago. She was it man. That was the chick I wanted to marry. We had a good life together, we had an apartment and we were in love. I still think about her every single day. I see her face in everything I do and everytime I close my eyes. Haha I'm gonna stop talking about her here...sorry just needed to get that off my chest. It's all I've been thinking about today and I don't really talk to anyone about it.

The reason why I'm home tonight is just so I can spend some time with my family before I leave for rehab on Thursday. I'm flying out to west palm beach for anywhere for 1-3 months in inpatient. I'm really looking forward to it! This will be my third inpatient rehab this year. It sucks because I know I have all the tools and know how to stay sober. I had a good amount of clean time but I just had a brief slip and got caught so my mom so we decided this is for the best. 

Oh, another reason why I'm home is because I was supposed to go to see flosstradamus in Chicago tonight. So the event sold out a few days ago, go on Craigslist to see how much they are going for...$150 which is 3x of the face value (and the ticket was an Xmas present). Then the junkie in me took over. I put mine up on CL and sold it last night so I could get more dope and some fishscale to go with it. 

Overall, it's been a good night even with the depression. It's safe to say I've been high as fuck all day today.

He said he couldn't do any small freebies/testers for me to try, and he only had G's, at which point I then proceeded to tell him I only had $60 bucks and maybe I would try him again next year, haha (get it? lame joke).

I went and picked up 300 of em all Ms from a guy I've dealt with a few times. Got em for 1900 per pack. A lil pricey for me in bulk. They came in three separate lil bundles.

I crushed up 3 of em and did em up...funny taste...weirdly easy to crush even for Ms. Didn't feel a god damned thing. Went through all 300 of em and one of the packs the 30 imprint looks like the wrong font. The other 200 look right and I did two out of each and they're real. I'm hoping I only got burnt for 100 of em and maybe the guy didn't know. I'm having Convo on phone with dude gonna meet up n show him.

Gonna have to go through every single one and make sure the other 200 are good. FUCK. I can't sell people fake shit. My guy better make it right.

Anyway 

TLDR be cautious buying Ms in the Seattle area. I'll try to get a pic up here that's clear enough to show how the 30 looks funny.

Edit:yes 19 a piece is getting stiffed a bit my other guy does em for 13 if I buy multiple packs (100s) sadly though people pay up to 23 for a single pack (100). 30 a pill is the standard here these days unless you're getting from a friend.

I would never knowingly pass fakes along to people who are spending precious cash to get and feel well. I do believe in karma.

I'm meeting up with the guy tomorrow to figure this out since its new years. I'm hoping for my money back...he claimed to have no idea what I was talking about.

UPDATE :

So this guy is a douchebag. Gave me the run around for hours today. I finally meet up with him a few hours ago. He tells me that he had no idea they were fake and sort of implied that I was lying and that he sold me all legit stuff. Told me they are all Ms and came from one person with a script he knows. I show him by burning one on some foil. The don't really smoke ..they dont slide like a real one they basically just sit there until they burn.

He concedes that ok yeah those aren't real...I'll give you 950 of your money back if you give me the fake pills back. I did it but I'm pretty sure he is just gonna rip someone else off with em. Took his number out of my phone and will never do biz again. Will also let anyone else that knows him too.

Not worth it to me to bring violence into my life over it at this point. 

TL;DR got half my money back the guy is a prick and I will never do biz with him again.

Well, after talking to him for a few hours, I have found out why, after all these years, he decided to contact me.

Turns out he has several health problems, and was scared he wouldn't have a chance to get to know me.

Now I realise this might all be just an excuse, but still not something I wanted to hear.

He explained why their was no contact for all the years, but won't be posting the reason on here due to it's personal nature.

So, where to go from here. It was left with him giving me all his contact details. Do I contact him, or wait to see if he contacts me again.

I am unsure as to what to do. 

On one hand I feel like making him wait, like he did to me for all those years.

On the other hand, if he really is in I'll health. I might not have the chance again.

This is a very difficult decision, and something I honestly thought I would never have to go through.

It might have been better if he had never contacted me in the first place.

Yeah, I know. Thats a lot of APAP, but it was just this once, so I didn't do a CWE. Worst nausea I've ever had in my entire life; it lastd for a good 16 hours also. I could not stand up, not from the nice buzz I got, but the nausea. Standing up for more than 2 minutes was not possible. This had me bedridden from 8pm the time I took it to lunch time the next day. 

Was this the APAP? does tylenol do that? Or was it the opioid? Is this going to be my experience every single time? I've taken more than that before (months ago) and I was fine... What a waste that was...

It's NYE, and I sent my lovely boyfriend to score, and now I'm waiting for him to get back. It took a reallly long time for him to get there, I thought our guy would have gone and left us but thank fuck he actually waited on, said he was going off at 4pm but was still there at 5. He's actually pretty good, and his bags are usually lush great lumps of bliss. 
Only sucky thing is he's 2 hours away, and today the trains were all fucked up so this is a long thing. I'm waiting, did all the errands and work and stuff that meant I didn't go scoring myself (I'm not just lazy, honest...) and I'm getting sick. I'm on Subutex maintenance, but no dose today because it's New Years Eve and we want to party. But now its getting grim and there's still an hour to go. Is it just me, or do you get sicker faster when you're waiting? The psychological anticipation fucks with you. Can't sit still, can't do anything useful. So I came to distract myself here, I like this place, of all the things I thought I'd find browsing through subreddits, I didn't dream there'd be such a cool lil opiate community.

I always hear of people smoking it, or chasing the dragon.  
I tried it out a few times yesterday, just taking a pinch of placing it on foil, attaching a hollowed out pen to it, and lighting from underneath, inhaling the fumes.  
People say it's hard to chase the dragon, but I seemed to get it down pretty fast, letting almost no smoke escape.  
The rush was nice, but it felt very speedy - not the lethargic noddy feeling I get from the monkey water. It only lasted about 20 minutes, and the taste tasted horrible. Like fucking vaporizing vinegar (I wonder why).  
Well when I woke up this morning, my mouth hurt. It felt like it was all cut up and sore. Any acidic foods I eat seem to put me in pain and it's really annoying.  
I assume this is from the acetic compounds in the smoke.  
My question being, why do people find smoking tar is the best ROA? (besides banging of course)   
It seems wasteful, short lived, and honestly painful...

He was obviousdly not an addict or really needing these pills bc he was clueless and honeslty just didnt know shit. But he came and met me at our local mall and I had my boyfriend driving. I told him that my dude just called back so we had to go get them and that he would have to follow us to the dudes street and park a couple houses before my dealers and give me the money and then i would pull up a couple houses and he would see my dude come out and bring them to me. He followed me and all went as planned. As soon as i got the money and got back in the car we started driving off slowly then booked it! We thought everything was fine then these redneck motherfuckers were on our ass. This led to a 15 minute high speed chase around my neighboorhood haha. But finally(i have no clue how) but we lost these dudes and got away. I mean i feel bad cause its never good to rob people, buit this dude didnt NEED the roxys and kind of set himself up. Calling a random ass girl 45min away thinking he was going to get pills that i pay 35 for sometimes for 8$, dudes trippin. hahaha.

Long story short I got arrested a few months back. My parents found out I was using. I came home for the holidays and am staying with my rents. I have been using occasionally while home. I didn't use yesterday but I used then two days before that and I used tonight. I smoke it and the quality is so so. I just got word that that my parents want to take me in for a drug test tomorrow.

The last and only other test I've had previous to this was when I first got back for break. It had only been 48 hours since my last sesh and I had been smoking daily for almost a year up to that point. I drank tons and tons of water before the test and passed somehow. 

There is a slight chance I'll be able to put the test off until Saturday so obviously I'm gonna go for that. But I might have to go first thing tomorrow morning.

They take me to one of those small clinics to get tested. They don't watch you pee but you have to empty your pockets and take off your jacket. Also you cannot get any water or soap in the room you pee in. They do a simple 10 panel strip test and they do NOT send the sample on to the lab, they just stick the strip in the cup and write down the results.

I'm obviously freaking out as failing this test has the potential to ruin my relationship with my parents forever. I considered doing the liquid hand soap beneath the finger nails trick or maybe trying to put some bleach in an eye dropper and tape it to my crotch. And it goes without saying I am going to be drinking as much water as I can stomach starting an hour ago.

So, I come to you guys begging and pleading, what are your tricks/success stories? Anyone have lots of experience beating these tests?

TL;DR I'm a jackass and have a drug test tomorrow morning or the following day and I smoked tonight. What are your tricks or methods for passing short notice tests?

Thank you so much in advance.


EDIT/UPDATE: Hey guys, thanks so much for the overwhelming support! Long story short I got off with no problems! I ended up being able to postpone the test until Saturday, then when Saturday came around I looked online and found out the testing facility closed at 2pm. So, I nonchalantly told my parents I had a bunch of errands to run in the morning and that right when I got back we could go over to the testing place. So, I timed it just right and didn't even get home until after 2pm. Then, once they realized it was closed they just sort of dropped it... I guess it was mostly just a bluff. All in all, my relationship with my parents is as good as it could be (considering I was recently arrested and they found out their son is/was a heroin addict). 

I can't say it enough though, I love you guys and I'm so glad that I can sit back and know that you guys always got my back. I'm safely back a few states away at University now so I shouldn't have to worry about much. They did say however they found a local company that will do random drug test several times a month,  apparently they call randomly a few times a month and give you a 24hr window to come in and take a test. So, I'm sure in the future I'll have to use at least one of these!

I know I really don't post here much but I've been lurking here for the greater part of last year. 

This week I've shot somewhere around ~100 bags and a little bit of coke since last Friday. I really just started banging it last week. I'm on vivatrol and it was about 23 days since my last shot that day. I figured snorting it wouldn't really break thru so I turned to shooting up. I actually registered first try, go figure. I could see the needle fixation growing FAST holy shit. There's nothing better than seeing that crimson rush of goodness shoot into the rig...it's fucking beautiful. 

Now this is probably unlikely but has anyone here/ know anyone that's been to New Day rehab in north palm beach, fl? 

anyway, tonight will probably be my last time on this sub. Last time i relapsed i actually came in here and before and just started friending...and we all know what happens after that.

In my whole career of using (almost a decade) I have NEVER experienced a day like today. I had some bad cut dope one time- that's it. I'm finally recovered enough to describe it.

Holy Jesus.... So glad to be alive and not writhing in agony. So, it's Friday and SO and I usually indulge a little. I called up the connect who is always up early and arranged to meet this morning so I could have a little something before work.

He said he had the ""good-good"" and the bag I got looked wonderful - so far so good.
I headed home, prize in hand.

Now I will mention we are super hygienic these days. Always a new point, clean water, fresh clean cottons. We wash our hands, wash the cooker, and always use alcohol swabs. Both of us are psycho about it because it's so important.

So this stuff looked great, but was really really dark on the rig, and smelled a little funny. We both did our shot and were like ""meh- okay but not what we were hoping for)."" I went on to work- SO works at home.

By the time I got to work and got situated at my desk I noticed  i was really chilly and had a headache starting. Out comes the heating pad and Advil, I'm starting to shake, it's getting worse. I thought about calling SO but didn't - still didn't know what was going on. I have never had cotton fever or bad dope except that one time- and that time it hit me right away. Then the phone rings- it's SO, panicking ""I think I got cotton fever!!!!"" Really scared. At that point I felt myself going downhill fast and knew I'd be lucky to make it home under my own power.

So the two of us spent a good 4 hours with ungodly excruciating headaches, chills, fever, leg and back pain. The whole thing was so unrelentingly painful- we went back and forth over whether or not to go to the hospital. I said if we were not better by 2 we were going. I never thought it would end. Absolutely one of the most frightening and painful things that can happen. 

Finally, finally we started feeling better. We had taken ibuprofen, klonopin, methadone and I took my blood pressure meds. We also have stayed hydrated. Then someone brought us some real dope. It was weird because we did a little, then kind of lost time, and came to feeling almost normal. The headaches are still not gone though. Just, fuck, you know? Fucking scary.

Anyone else been thru this? I didn't know WTF to do.

I squished and rolled the water around the bag for a bit, making sure to clean each part of it. The remaining fluid was about the color of the monkey water I normally make with a good dose.

It took a good two weeks before I was feeling more or less normal. I then waited another two for good measure.

That leads up to two weeks ago when I decided to dive back in. I coped that night and shot a quarter at around 8pm. Felt AMAZING for the rest of the night. Best thing next to your first time IMO. 

The surprise came the next morning when I woke up feeling like absolute SHIT. It was like someone shot me up with narcan in the middle of a great high. Almost as bad as the worst moment of withdrawls after a month long binge. My dealer was away for the holidays so I spent the next 2 days dry-heaving and then another 3 with no sleep and horrible diarrhea.

This was a pretty startling experience. Not like I've never been through withdrawls before, it's just I'm usually expecting it. 

With my dealer away I had to wait another 10 days before coping again. This brings me up to 4 days ago when I finally picked up a half. Once again I shot up in the evening, felt great, and woke up feeling like I was in the middle of withdrawls.

I know it's rare to go from a long binge, to cold turkey, to a one time high before going cold turkey again but who knows.

I copped before I left, and went through my bundle fairly quickly. Needless to say it was shitty having to be sick while down in the sunny state, but I was lucky enough to find a few blues while down there. Anyway, in my rush to leave, I did a shot and left all my paraphernalia laying around. After the almost 20 hour drive home, which my fiancee and I did without stopping, we got home feeling pretty desperate.

The stuff I copped before leaving was of decent quality, but was cut with something that was not water soluble. After inspecting the spoon, I saw all the cut dried up on the edges. Now normally I don't give it a second thought (and would have cleaned the spoon after using it anyway). In my desperation, however, I decided to see if there were any goodies left in the crusty mess. I threw in some water, mixed it really well, and ran it through a filter a couple times. I was left with 70 units of light tan solution. I've had cotton fever enough times to feel pretty wary about injecting, but of course I went ahead and banged it. After pushing down, I count... 5, 10, 15 seconds and nothing. I felt pretty defeated, of course there was nothing in it... and then, BAM, not a rush per se, but that all-too-familiar warm blanket encompasses my body, and all my achy muscles from the long car ride suddenly loosen up.

Usually this is cuz I didn't drink anything with it, so I downed a couple cups of water and waited. 

It didn't help at all, and the pain was growing more and more intense and wasn't coming in waves, just sharp constant pain. Also, what bothered me most is I suddenly had severe fatigue, and soon couldn't even pick myself up off the bed. It became an agonizing feat to even get up and walking, and the whole time I felt like collapsing and did, which is when my mom called the ambulance for me. 

They came and assessed me asking me questions (I drifted in and out of consciousness from the pain at this point) and they loaded me in and took me to the hospital. I could barely even speak and just remember them putting in an IV and remarking on my abscess (lol) then I drifted off. I woke up at like 5pm, having gone in at 9am, and the nurse was just waking me asking if I'd like to go home. 

I said yeah cuz the pain was gone, and they released me. It was so odd, and I was so weak and they never said anything more about it and honestly, since the pain was gone, I just wanted to be home. It was so so strange I don't know what to make of it. I came home and went and got a morphine and IV'd that and felt normal for a bit but now I'm up and sick and wary of taking more lope cuz that was a little terrifying ",1389104117.0
1umffi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1umffi/unconventional_opiates/,30,https://redd.it/1umffi,suspiciousface,Unconventional Opiates,"This is all very subjective, so if you have had similar experiences and/or actually know what you're talking about, I'd love some input.

I am on venlafaxine and mirtazapine, an SNRI and NaSSA respectively. The combination is sometimes referred to as ""California rocket fuel"". They also both have some affinity for opiate receptors, apparently, which may explain efficacy in treatment of depression.

Anyways, I've only taken opiates orally, PST, codeine, and loperamide with P-gp inhibitors. Venlafaxine on it's own certainly doesn't have any recreational value for me, but the combo is comparable to codeine, caffeine, and diphenhydramine. Mirtazapine is an antihistamine as well, AFAIK, so I assume the two drugs potentiate each other. 

A cigarette or a beer, or both, along with my daily doses is just heaven. 

I also got a decent nod from varying amounts of loperamide (immodium) with a few mouthfuls of black pepper (piperine being the active ingredient) and boiled down tonic water/syrup stuff that was incredibly gross. Not worth it unless I take upwards of 50mg loperamide, but interesting to see that it works (for me, at least).

Anything that was related to opiates would never cross through my brain, because I've heard of all the danger it caused.  However, just last night, I ended up taking 10mg of percocet just to try it out.  I love to try different drugs, but I never want to become dependent on them, and I figured that percocet is a good place to start if I want to learn more about how my body works with opiates.

And with that 10mg of percocet, I probably had one of the best drug related experiences of my life.  I learned so much about how my body works, and the warm and fuzzy felt superb.  Through the midst of this joy, I realized why people could become really dependent on this stuff.  It seemed really dangerous in terms of doing more, and that's my biggest fear when I want to try more.

Right now I don't have any intense desire to try some more, but I want to see how my body reacts with a lot of different opiates (I'm thinking about trying some hydrocodone and codeine when I get the chance).  So for people who were in a very similar situation, how do you end up controlling yourself from letting opiate intake get out of control?  I feel like I have good control of it so far, but that really doesn't mean much when I've only tried a fairly weak opiate once.

I have become jealous of people doing drugs I haven't, I hate it. 

The basis of my fear as far as I can tell, will the bliss I get from being in love be diminished or even worse will my partners love be diminished. Will it no longer measure up. I am also afraid that if I used it once I would be ok until something bad happened that I am not equipped to deal with.

The first bag I picked up was supposed to be a bundle but then it turned into a half gram for 120. When I got it it looked off and when I got it home it was complete shit. Being the fiend that I am I still tried to dissolve and shoot it, but it barely dissolved. Then because it's so dry around here I had to hit up the same person. They promised to get me back for the one before and set me up right but their second stuff weighed out to be like .3 not a half g and it had a lot of cut. So then I try my other friend who acted like he was getting pure straight from afghanistan, saying things like ""promise me you'll only do one point"". Then when he hands me the bag its like a little point bag and I'm like dude this looks like one point and he's like no it's a half g. Anyways I weigh it out and it's only .13. So over the last two weeks I've spent $450 on what was supposed to be 1.5 grams and instead I've barely got three decent points. I live close to [city] but my license is suspended until June and as a white dude I feel like I'll just get robbed if I try to cold cop, that or busted by a cop trying to sell to me. To make things worse I have almost constant stomach pain that only cannabis or opiates can help. I've seen specialists and they diagnosed me with IBS and basically apologized for not being able to do anything. I'm always dealing with this grumbling pain that seems to only be alleviated with either of those two drugs. I was only picking up weed but I tried the H because it's way cheaper when I score real points. I've been using opiates since I was 15 (I'm 23). I started a dispensary in southern california but between hassles with landlords and my business partner getting too involved in H I had to move back to VA. I also had a full ride scholarship to Uni but I couldn't focus because of the pain and again no doctors have taken me seriously. The few times I've talked to a doctor about this pain I feel like they judge me to be an addict and don't give me any help. My uncle had a problem with oxycontin and my dad is terrified of pain medicine and would flip even when I got percoset to recover from surgery. So basically I'm in pain but can't get help because the doctors want to sell me BS physical therapy (aka bill more hours) and not give me the medicine I need. I can't score without being robbed up the ass. I'm really coming to the end of my rope. I'm thinking fuck it and move to afghanistan or mexico where I can get decent dope and not live constantly in pain. I might still get robbed but at least there I can hunt down the thieves myself instead of sitting around like a tool.

Is codeine active in itself as a weak opiate, or is it REQUIRED to be demethylated to the active morphine? That is, is it purely a prodrug, or is the parent compound active (like tramadol)? I'm fairly certain that the net effect of taking proton pump inhibitors is greater analgesia from the extended effects of morphine, versus the small amount of morphine I'd get from the morphine synthesis in vitro (I'm a pretty poor metabolizer anyway).

To my surprise the liquid came out quite brown and produced a very nice withdrawl soothing high. Nothing special but much more than I expected.

However, I would just like to mention that i feel like the derision of kratom is somewhat unjustified. I've felt better on a good strong dose of kratom than I've had on 50 mg of hydro or even slightly smaller doses of oxy. At the same time, yes, the kratom withdrawals are weaker but definitely still fucking withdrawals. I recently stopped a pretty heavy habit for about 5 months and went through hell: sleeplessness, achyness, depression, boredom, complete loss of appetite, nauseau and just general unpleasantness. I also get awful cravings that I still don't really know how to conduct myself with. And yes, I know it's not as bad as withdrawals from oxy and others and bla bla bla, but honestly it's still very, very real. I guess I'm trying to communicate with y'all that the mention of someone's DOC being kratom shouldnt bring us to mock or ignore, and just generally be respectful of each others habits and potentially lower tolerances, even if it's with something weaker like kratom.

In my neck of the woods heroin is rare. It's a great cause of despair for me every day. I yearn, I bleed, I torture myself all day with the want and the pain that my psychological addiction causes me. So I replace, or rather distract myself, from my addiction with literature and prose that understands the place that I'm in. 

I was sober for 14 weeks. That's hard to believe, considering the place I'm in now. I fell in love with a reformed addict. More accurately, I fell in love with the dopamine he gave me. As soon as I went sober, I replaced my drugs with him. And as soon as it ended, 14 weeks later, I replaced his dopamine with my DOC of heroin. It's hard to find, and after only a week-long bender I was high and dry. To deal with the withdrawals, I immersed myself in the endless delights of Ambien. I saved my script all month and it still only lasted me three days. I latched onto that. Ambien was my crutch. Once it was gone, and I was left completely drugless and still withdrawing mildly, I started going to NA meetings. It was the only thing that made me feel better. When I went home for Christmas break, I started a Xanax binge that gave my mother the reason she needed to kick me out of the house. The next few days were all a blur, with couchsurfing with friends and dosing on Kratom just to get some sleep. This week or two past I've been loading up on uppers and calming down with alcohol. The only thing keeping me positive is the fact that I'll be leaving this Godforsaken town in a matter of days and returning to pursue my education. At the moment I'm numb-faced and giddy from a few lines of coke and a few shots of gin (not my favorite, but in times of need anything'll do). 

""My day in the light, the day is darkening. I'm hurling all the little joys against the greater sadness. The sadness is a giant weight. It presses down. Its meaning: ""What's the point?"" The little joys are pebbles. The pebbles are getting smaller and smaller and the weight of the sadness is growing, the sadness is gaining density and mass, until in the end I'm throwing handfuls of dust at matter so thick there's no spaces between the molecules. Nowhere anywhere for anything to move. The years roll on. I can't stop. I just can't stop. I can't stop anymore."" -Luke Davies, *Candy*

There seems to be a bit of a drought in my area at the moment. Does anyone else take almost anything in the absence of heroin because anything is better than being completely sober? I've been on an upper binge, which makes no sense because I hate uppers. But I'll take anything. Coke, Adderall, I even (accidentally, if you can believe it) took meth. 

""Now as soon as they had tasted the honey-sweet fruit of the lotus, they wished for nothing better than to stay where they were, living with the folk of that country and feeding on the lotus. They remembered their own homes no longer, nor did they yearn any more to return to their own land..."" -Homer, *The Odyssey*

I'm 2 days into WD and there's no sign of it letting up soon.

 So I figured I'd use what little energy I have left in my hands to make a post and get my mind off of this horrible feeling. Just putting this out here now, this will be a pretty extensive post, so mind the TL;DR at the end if interested. This post is going to be of my climb up to a king and the downfall, which i'm now hellishly basking in.

I knew about dope for a long time, a best friend of mine got addicted when we were both like 17, his girlfriend got a bunch of money from her father dying and was using all of it to buy massive amounts of dope, crack, coke, anything really. I watched my best friend descend into this dark, scary place that I really didn't like seeing him in, and it somehow reached out to me, trying to pull me in as well. He was always shooting up, he stopped hanging out with me, and would only hang out with me after he had shot up. This had really bothered me at the time, seeing as how I felt like I wasn't good enough to hang out with unless he was drugged up. He soon after ended up getting kicked out of his parents and going to rehab. 

I had a pact with myself to never do hard drugs, but I also had this same pact with any other substance that I was currently abusing at the time at some point. I was more of an alcoholic than anything, drinking large amounts of straight everclear, I also had a bad pill problem, anything and everything I could find, I either snorted or just straight downed. I was binging for days at a time drinking alcohol, snorting upwards of 120mg of adderall a day, I was also a stoner, smoking weed helplessly all the time and on top of that abusing DXM consistently, sometimes daily throughout a week taking upwards of 1g at a time of DXM (I never realized how bad dxm was for me until it was too late). 

Everyone always looked up to me in high school and I don't know why, everyone respected me and always praised my attention, and I was just a junkie, trying to get a fix from anything and everything that I could, no one knew that, at least, the people who did didn't know how bad it actually was. People just assumed that I was a teenager trying to have fun, however it's always been much more than that. 

(skip forward about 2-3 years)

Everything was perfect, I had a job making $11, it was a loose job too, I only ""had"" to work 3 hours a day, but I could pick up as many extra hours as I wanted, i'm only 19 years old with no college history as of yet, so this was a fairly decent prospect for me. I got myself my first apartment with some room mates on a campus area in my hometown, I lived on the 4th story of an apartment building. At this point I had noticed that a lot of my friends were starting to get into dope, my original friend at the time had not been in it as much anymore, only chipping and he's still doing a fine job at keeping it under control. Being back in the city gave me the advantage of being around all of my close friends again. I kept seeing dope come around my house because I never minded it, I had come to accept it as something that was going to be around, and I was just purely okay with it.

I was always so interested in it, watching people do it and the way they acted afterwards, how they felt, I was drawn to it more and more. (I was suffering from some pretty bad anxiety/panic disorder at the time from my dxm use and thought maybe that dope could help me with my anxiety, fear of death etc.) I eventually tried it for the first time.

A friend of mine came over with a half gram of this legendary purplish blue dope that was going around at the time, this dope was probably the most delicious thing that I've ever tasted, the best dope I've ever had no doubt. He warned me, he wanted me to try it out because I had an interest but said not to do too much. So he broke me off a half a tenth to work with for my first night. I started off doing .02 of a point. I had no interest in shooting it at the time, just wanted to snort it and see where it took me.

Immediately after snorting it, I stood up, and walked out onto my 4th story balcony. As I felt the warm tingling sensation enshroud my entire body from the back of my head, going down my neck all the way to the base of my spine, and then the pure bliss that followed, it seemed like some kind of miracle, this couldn't be this drug, it was so amazing, such an amazing experience, all the pain I'd ever experienced was gone, I was a cloud, no, I was the sun shining through the grey-black clouds after a hellish storm, the first light of hope. As I stood there looking over this gorgeous nature preserve park right across the road, I felt the sun's beams glare off of my skin, I have never felt a more orgasmic experience. The warmth of the sun on my skin, and the cool breeze blowing through my hair. I took a deep breath in and felt alive, for the first time in months, years. After this, I continued using dope sparingly, getting a bag here and there when I threw a party or had a group of friends coming over. I loved this substance, and was becoming more attached to it, and didn't think anything of it. It took all my pain away, I was finally happy for once.

I was only in that apartment for a summer sublease, so I had to move out last august, and find a new place to stay, I ended up moving across town to a new house, that would be my new home leading up until just a few days ago. After moving into this new house, I immediately ended up spending a lot less money on costs as previously required due to the rent being lower and utilities being included, i fell into a lot more spending money which was nice. I started selling out of my new house, D and weed mainly. I had a good friend of mine who was giving me straight qps and hps of some medical imported from colorado. I was making thousands of dollars a day and reinvesting into my sales, buying nearly a hp a day and 2 grams of some decent dope. 
Since I was making so much money, I quit my job (Bad decision)

I was selling to a lot of close friends of mine when it came to dope, I slowly started falling into it more and more as I kept selling, I went from doing 1 point a day, to 3 points, and then even half grams a day, I never started shooting though, I've never wanted to shoot, as I'd seen how it changed all of my friends, I saw all of my friends who use to snort, start shooting it, and they never went back, and they started selling all of their things to get more money to buy dope from me.

 I felt bad, seeing this happen to my friends so they could give me their money, so I would give them free batches here and there to keep them at bay a while longer. Without me even knowing, I was addicted to dope bad. Since I always had dope, I never had to worry about being sick, for months, I never went a day without dope for basically half a year. And then one day, the money ran out, I hit the bottom of my stash, people got arrested, connects were lost, and it left me with nothing. After getting fucked over on a few bad batches of d, I was left with no money. Nothing. All of the people who I thought were my friends, the people I let stay in my house for free, the people I gave free drugs too, the people I gave free food, etc. No one was there to help me. After the first 20 hours of not having dope is when I realized, I was beginning WD, I had stomach cramps that felt as though a thousand knives were passing through my intestines, a head ache that any split sound could throw over the edge, all of the typical symptoms that I'm sure any other unfortunate soul on here has experienced. 2 days into my WD, I fell into a little bit of money and bought myself a half point off of a friend, It was some decent black/brownish rock that I was able to make last me the rest of the day only taking bumps when needed.  

Aside from how horrible I felt, everyone kept telling me how lucky I was, something about how since I never shot up, I never got the withdrawals the same, apparently snorting wd and shooting wd are extremely different, I couldn't bother to care much at the time because the people would unload their bags into their spoons right in front of me, and i'd watch them put the needle into their arms and drift back into a cloud. Right in front of my face when I was beyond sick. I wanted that same pleasure again. I had to move all of my stuff out of my old house into my new apartment the other day, where I'm staying now. I had to do all of this while sick, Lifting couches, beds, bagging shit up, it was horrible, trying to pull energy out of you that you don't even have. Where I'm staying at now, it's kind of difficult to come across dope, I'm not going to be coming into any more money until tax season most likely as I'll be getting my tax return and then some money back that my mom owes me. I just got 2 bags the other night, it lasted me 2 days, it kept the sickness away, that's all i've wanted, was to feel normal again. 

Now I'm sitting here, on the edge of my bed, hunched over my computer, zoning out, wishing some magical person could come by and give me a bump, something to get me off my feet.

TL;DR: I knew a friend who did dope, it got me interested eventually. I started doing it and loved it. Started selling dope and weed eventually going through 2gs+ a day snorting a hg to myself usually and hp's of weed, I was making thousands. Everything fell apart, lost my house, a lot of my friends, all of my money, now I'm sick and living far away from any dope.

I understand this was a pretty long post, and I apologize, I just figured i'd share my story, and get my mind occupied for a while before I go back to laying in every uncomfortable position back on my bed.

Hope you all enjoy your day, and stay warm.

So back to the point(n.p.i), I'd rather she not use needles because its a barrier that can change a recreational user and generally leaves a longer lasting impression. Plus I figure there's no need for her to try it IV if I give her a sufficient dose to snort but its been so long since I wasted..err snorted H that i'm a bit unsure on dosage.

I figure I'll give her double what I inject when I have no tolerance? The gear I get is SE-ASIA #4 and 0.05 (50mg) gets me nodding hard so would somewhere around 80-100mg snorted be roughly the same experience for her minus the rush?

1. Does Naproxen even act as a potentiator? I did a little research ad I came up with a little evidence that it does, so I said why not? 

2. Is this as high of a dose as I think it is? Maybe 'high' isn't a good word, but I thought this was a pretty decent dose. Erowid doesn't have a dosage page and all I could find was that 120-180 seems to be a sweet spot. 

1. The syrup I have contains 10mg Codeine and 100mg of Guifenisen per 5mL. How much Guifenisen is a typical ""puking"" point, or does it vary from person to person? I seem to have an immunity to guifenisen, seeing as how I just ingested 1200mg. But I'll go higher if it's safe. 

And finally, is it even possible to nod off to on codeine? Is this even worth my time? My girlfriend has another refill, and I won't ask for it if it's not worth it. Also, sorry if I seem opiate naive, my opiate knowledge is decent but I'm not a big user of them.",1389204635.0

If you hate it, downvote it and move along please. K. I've had a 4 month and 1 week habit that started with vicodin and ended with dilaudid, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Friday night was the last time I had anything. It wasn't a whole lot. Basically enough to keep me from w/d. Well Saturday I cut up a sub strip into 8 and had one piece. Then I decided I was just gonna get the w/d over with. Ride it strait through hell. Sunday was extremely uncomfortable. So cold, so hot. I took 6mg immodium, but seeing as I take prilosec, I thought I shouldn't take much because of the ability of PPIs to aid lopes ability to stay on the fun side of the BBB. Look it up if you don't believe me. (Lope passes the BBB but is immediately removed by P-glycoproteins, which are somewhat inhibited by PPIs like prilosec.) Anyways, Monday was still uncomfortable, but Tuesday I started to feel better. Wednesday I was completely better. The only issue I still had was sleep, solved by Xanax and Ambien. Yesterday I would say I was 95% better. No anxiety. I had some energy. I could FEEL! I was laughing finally. I just think I went through the W/D quick. I have a SLOW metabolism, too. I also think I only had the runs like 8 times, if that. So the question is, after detoxing so rapidly, is it ok to take something? I have 80mg hydrocodone from when I stopped taking it because it didn't do shit. Would I feel anything from taking a little? Just to satisfy my mental cravings. Also, I'm pretty sure it won't, but would it send me into withdrawals if I take some today and today only. I have other types of things that will stop my urges in case I crave tomorrow. Thanks guys. Sorry for the long post.
TL;DR Been a week since last dose. Had mild W/D for a few days. Will I feel anything from a weaker opiate than I'm used to 7 days after a stronger one and will I go into W/D again from just one fun day.

Edit: It might be good to add that towards the end, I was working on lowering tolerance, and 45mg oxy would get me ripped. I would take somewhere between 30-45mg to feel real good and the just keep the buzz all day.",1389362194.0

Well, that hasnt been an issue now for about 4 months, I've had the most steady and awesome connect of good, cheap dope you could ever want. He's even been fronting me grams to sell in the next town over, and giving me dope to do it, so essentially for the last month or so i've been MAKING money to do about a half a day. But of course all good things come to an end, as of yesterday my guy just stopped responding to me out of nowhere, his phone is still on but he just wont answer me and I have no idea why. He isnt showing up in the arrest records and I drove by his house yesterday and his car was there with the lights on. So of course, now begins the process of dope taking away all that it has given me the past few months. I do not feel good at all and have been scrambling to find some subs or dope, with no luck so far. It has been so long since I've been in this situation, but at the same time it is all too familiar.

As a funny story, the dope that i usually get is white, it looks basically like coke, but its decent H. Well my dude also sells crack, or ""work"" as the kids call it these days. The other day i go to pick up my usual 3 grams to sell, and i do a line on the way to sell it. Right away i know something is wrong...it looks the same basically, but it tastes like coke. For some reason i just assume it was new dope that was cut with coke and go to sell it anyway. Well after selling it I do a fat line because i wasnt feeling anything off the first one and....yep, thats crack. I had never done crack before and i did damn near a half G of it, and sold it to my to be sold in tenths to others. I was freaking out, but first I had to hit up my other guy and get a legit half of dope to calm my ass down. My dude ends up realizing his mistake and we bring him back around 1.5 grams of the work (minus what i did and what my guy sold to unlucky junkies that shot up crack...i do feel bad but it was an honest mistake on everyone's part) and he just hands me the 3 grams of dope I originally wanted at a discount. So we had a good laugh about that.

But I aint laughing now. Inexplicably, I cant get ahold of my main dude or my secondary guy, they just wont answer..and I have no idea what to do. Might end up buying some lope tonight which i havent fucked with in months, but its nice to know that options there. The worst part of all this is I went to Florida with my family over christmas, was gone for 9 days, and took 5 subs with me and was sober for 9 days. And I made the decision to buy dope again after a full week of telling myself I could just walk away, the hard part was over. But I didnt, I have been doing a half or more a day for 10 days now and am sick as a dog, with money to burn but no one will answer the phone. C'est la vie when you're a junkie. Anyway, I hope everyone else is nice and warm and has a nod going, and I hope this doesnt sound too whiny.

I see a lot of threads about calculating how much you spent on your addiction as well as the topic being brought up in conversation whether its sober people after a meeting or active users. And the end result is usually everyone being disgusted with themselves and not wanting to think about it. I heard everything from ""man i could have a new bmw with all that money i spent"" to even ""shit i could have bought a fucking house with house much i spent"". Well the other day and a few friends were smoking a blunt and this topic came up. 10k, 20k, 50k, etc. Thinking about it not many addicts make that much legitimately so everyone has their hustles whether its robbing, shoplifting, panhandling, whatever you name it weve done it. The point is most of that absurb amount of money youve spent on dope, you wouldnt have in the first place if you werent addicted. I mean how many people shoplift, return stolen items, stick up dealers/addicts, or go car hoping because they are saving for college or making mortgage payments? Just a thought for anyone whos feeling depressed about the financial aspect of this shit. Its no doubt still a problem for all of us but hopefully thinking about it this way wont make it seem as bad. And yes i know there are addicts out there who support their habit 100% legally through good paying jobs but i think its safe to say the majority of us have done some questionable shit to say the least. edit-spelling",1389295697.0

So I'm clean off the H since Dec 1st, but still take the occasional tramadol or low dose oxy, maybe twice a month.

I have in the past mixed H, xanax and booze which was of course stupid. 

I loathe uppers but know they shouldnt be mixed with beta blockers. What about opiates and a few beers with the beta blockers?

I have recently mixed low oxy dose, very low Valium dose and beer but I'm trying to avoid situations that involve me not waking again up these days ;-)

I pass what feels like the millionth car ignoring the speed limit signs which fellow citizens at least pretend to adhere to with their 75 mile an hour speed. Every second brings me closer. It sure doesn’t feel that way though. My mind recognizes only one thing; high and not high.
	
I know where the cops sit and force myself to slow down when making those few turns on what has been nicknamed the heroin highway, but then again what stretch of highway doesn’t hold that nickname these days. I’ve made this drive well over a hundred times this year and have been incredibly lucky to have only been pulled over once. 

My wellness balances on the half-life of the last heroin I shot over half a day ago, its a balance that is more science than art regardless of what the chic dope users spew about in their countless journals and stories. I am no different. 
           
I’m at the point where there is no such thing as peace within my body, just an urge greater than any non-addict has ever known. The sun is bright. The brightness pounds into my cornea compounding the headache I’ve had since tossing and turning in bed this morning. I turn the radio down, there is no such thing as distraction at this point. There is only the pot of gold at the end of my self-imposed rainbow, its black cauldron holding under a gram in weight of my chosen relief, no gold, no leprechaun, just the beige powder that calls millions of names every waking second of every fucking day.

I finally am within a mile of the exit and frantically search for the ticket that the kind toll booth lady hands me every other day. She knows my unshaven face and bedhead as well as I know her judging eyes. She must knows what’s up, but there isn’t any possible way for me to give less of a shit about what she thinks. Finally I find it underneath my seat as I count out the dimes and nickels which will save me from my 29th fourty dollar ticket for blowing through the speed pass.

I call my dealer to let him know that I am ten minutes away. He doesn’t answer my call which pisses me off although there could be a thousand legitimate reasons which stem from his otherwise normal life. He works a 40 hour week but capitalizes on the thousand of white folk from the neighboring area that flock to the city he grew up in seek of relief. His green Lexus symbolizing the money I hand him whenever I have the opportunity.

I am finally within a mile of his house when he calls me back. He tells me to meet him at his secondary spot, the one I passed five miles ago. I tell him I’ll be there in five minutes wishing for just one day our positions could be switched. Him relying on me and knowing what its like to have his heart skip a beat when he sees my name on his caller ID. Him looking like shit 90% of the time we see each other instead of in his expensive urban wear. Him counting the dollars he scrounged up before I hand him his goods at a 100% mark-up. There’s no reason for me to wish ill on him as he’s been as good as can be to a client, which is what he calls me, even though we both know he says feigned when I’m not around.
 
I pull into the parking lot on the outskirts of the city. Its a great place to meet in the summer. Fences with thick vines surround the parking lot, one of his few girlfriends live here. I wonder if she knows how much of that necklace that she wears has been funded by me. I’m being stupid though, of course she knows what’s up, she did meet me that one time handing me my bundles as I momentarily forget about my sickness enchanted by her light brown skin and thick lips. She was friendly and I could see the momentary sadness in her eyes, knowing that most of the luxury in her life comes from the decay in my own life.

He pulls in a minute later and comes up to the window. This is his territory, he doesn’t fear the police. He makes a thousand a week, maybe two thousand on a good week through his secondary “job,” but he is picky on who he serves. The stamp is the same as its been for the past three months, just how this day is the same thing everytime except for when I’m short a few dollars and have to be extra nice. He knows it makes no difference to him, the three dollars here or four dollars there, but still has to play his position and always lets me know to not make a habit of it, which I don’t. Many times I’ve had to ask strangers for a dollar or two for gas to get me home not wanting to be short with my man twice in a row.

I pull out of the parking lot knowing that I could never make it home before getting high. I’ve played this game in this part of the city long enough to know where the best spots to go are. I drive two miles down the road and pull into one of the nicer apartment parking lots with its trees and bushes where I can park my car besides keeping me as inconspicuous as possible.

I tear open my new pack of needles and pull my kit outta my backpack. I’m just a minute or two away now and I have to focus to steady my hand. I split the tape which keeps every nickel sized bag of dope together. Once the bags are split I line them up together completely unfolded, tearing off the top of seven bags simultaneously. I empty each one out into my cooker admiring the beige color of them. Next I draw the 40 units I need into my syringe being more exact then is necessary. 

The water mixes with the dope devouring the powder so instantaneously that I need to stir it but once before it is ready. I open my pack of Camels and pull out a cigarette, tearing off a tiny piece of the filter which I roll in between my fingers before dropping it into the brown liquid of relief. I push the point of the needle into the cotton and draw up every bit of the substance that I can.

I pull my arm out of the long sleeved shirt I’m wearing and bring my arm out from the bottom of the shirt. I wrap the sleeve around my bicep while pumping my fist, thankful that my veins haven’t given out yet. I hit a vein within a minute and finally relax when I see the red mushroom cloud entering the chamber. I push down on the plunger and quickly pull the needle out of my arm where a single drop of blood pools at the surface. I turn the radio backup and get lucky when a song I like comes on. 

Its been thirty seconds and I suddenly feel what I drove here for, the pins and needles start in my fingertips and toes working their way up my body to my lips. Its almost overwhelming and I exhale loudly relishing in the taste of vinegar on the back of my tongue. The dope massages away the tightness in my back and the feelings of inadequacy in my brain and I finally can enjoy the cigarette that I light instead of just smoking it out of habit. The world is my oyster and I’m its pearl for the moment. I don’t linger out of a sudden respect for the people who leave which as all of my respect of the world I know is another fleeting feeling.

I pull out of the parking lot headed to the home which I still have at the moment, I have enough dope to keep me well even passed this time tomorrow but I will have to return unless I want to make the drive sick again the next day. I call a few people I middleman to let them know that all is well and that I will be back in an hour. I hit the highway when I start to think about how I’ll get the money together tomorrow. The cycle has been reset for another 24 hours.

I have been experimenting with various drugs for about 2 years. The first drug I ever tried was alchohol I found it enjoyable and fun, but it was exactly what I was looking for in a drug so I kept experimenting. Next up I tried smoking weed and liked it a lot and found it to be better than alcohol but it still felt like something was missing. I ended up breaking my arm about 8 months ago and that night they put me on a morphine iv and I have never felt better in my life. I layed in my hospital bed completely painless and I felt like everything was how it should be. I normally am a somewhat shy person but I was talkative and felt like I was connecting with everyone that I spoke to. In my opinion when I am on opiates I am happier and I feel like I am living up to my potential when I am high. Opiates are no doubt my drug of choice,they make me feel complete and help me overcome the things that I dislike about myself. I have abused various pain medications that go from codeine hydrocodone oxycodone dilaudid and fentanyl since then and I have loved every single one. But lately I have begun to worry I have read so many posts about people who feel hopeless and feel like they don't feel emotions like they used to. That they feel numb and unhappy without opiates. I have the rest of my life ahead of me I am only nineteen years old but I would like to have opiates in my life for the rest of my life. Opiates are the perfect drug for me it's like the chemicals combine perfectly with my body chemistry and personality. I don't want to live without opiates but I don't want them to lose the magic they have to me. I have been on a few long binges that have ended with horrible withdrawals but I didn't care. I want to chip on opiates for the rest of my life but chipping seems impossible eventually. From all the posts I've read people always fail at chipping. I need advice I want to keep doing opiates but I am clean at the moment and I am at a crossroads.

Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things. For example when we're back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any one of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do,God, believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. It must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child. On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know! I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out than to fade away. Peace, love, empathy. Kurt Cobain Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your alter. Please keep going Courtney, for Frances. For her life, which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE YOU, I LOV[E YOU!

My wife has found out, so now I risk losing both her and my son. After not talking to me for about 6 hours, she has finally given me a choice. Drugs, or my family.

I chose my family, but believe me, it was not an easy decision. You would think it would be a simple choice, but that's the hold dope has on me, and had had for some time now.

What truly scared me was that during all this going on, my wife screaming at me in tears. All I could think about was going to score. I mean, how fucking low is that.

What's fun now, will screw up your life in the end. You just can't see it yet.

EDIT: well, my wife is still talking to me today, which is a start. I gotta hand over my debit and credit cards when she comes back later.

She is uber angry still, which I expected. But, angry is better than not talking to me at all.

Personally I am feeling very low today. The reality of my fuck up is starting to hit home.



EDIT 2: Well, I had to hand over my bank cards, credit cards etc, so no more dope. I have been told if I use any more she is filing for divorce, and to seek help. Fully understandable and a small price.

The good news is she is not leaving with our son, unless I fuck up and use again. Which I won't, I can't. I won't lose my family, my son.

Some swear by it as a recreational opiate, others consider it nothing more than something to avoid unless sick. 

Well, despite having never taken fent, I have taken just about every other opiate under the sun, including a run with IV dope, and now, the inevitable bit of MMT. Now, I know that mixing done and Fent is a flat-out bad idea, but what I don't know is what kind of dosage and ROA I should use if I decided to take a break from the Methadone and then have some fun with the fent. 

My current normal maintenance dose of Done is 50mg daily, although I purchase it strictly on the black market and some days, when I'm feeling bored or blue, I'll go ahead and double up my dose to 100mg (sometimes 110mg). 

I recently tried to bang 60g of morpine and felt little more than a little warmth from the histamine release.

So there you have an idea of my tolly. Any advice from the Fent vets?

P.S. The other alternative is to take a Methadone hiatus and use something else. I've already got Morp-Sulfate, but was wondering if Oxy might be a better bet? Where I live the original OC's are still the only thing on the market, so banging is very much an option. It's just that I've never shot the shit (only eaten and railed), so I'm not sure what to expect from mainlining it. Any advice/opinoins? I enjoy IV morph, but not all that much to be honest. The fact that the 1CC solubility is capped at ~60mg makes it annoying as hell when your tolly climbs

I started by heating up a small amount (10 oz) of water to about 160 degrees, then backing off the power (depends on your cooktop), until it's under 140.

What I'll usually do is use a pretty large/wide induction compatible saute pan, say 4 qt., 12 wide. I'll do a wash of 4 lb and add it to the pan, and keep adding until it evaporates. It evaporates around 4 oz per hour. You can do a second wash if you want to be thorough and maybe get a better yield. In any case, I keep adding to the mix as it evaporates. I try to bring the reduction down to some easy multiple of the amount of lbs. I've washed, eg, end up with 24 oz for 12 pounds means you only have to drink 4 oz of nasty shit instead of 24 for 2 lb of ps.

1v040u,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1v040u/advice_from_peroin/,58,https://redd.it/1v040u,sinisterskrilla,Advice From Peroin.,"I had never even considered street copping until an argument with my then middle man, Perrin, who me and my addict friends called Peroin. He lived just ten minutes from the city, though still a 50 minute drive from my small town. The bundles back home were $80-$90 for inconsistent dope from flaky dealers. His impressive amount of connects and $50 bundles were attractive enough for him to become my main source. 

The deal was that every time I picked up through him I had to give him 50% of my dope up to a bundle, passed that it was all mine. Most of his dealers didn’t mind selling singles but they all had their one bun minimum. The cut for him was the same whether buying one bundle or ten, and with the size of his habit it seemed reasonably fair. The argument arose when I had only $50 and didn’t want to split the bundle 50-50. 

“If you don’t like my fucking tax how about your drive your ass down to the corner of Appleton and Elm where the Cops sit and the dope’s half as good. Your $50 would get you less of a high then splitting this one with me. It took me two years working my way up connects until I finally worked my way up to this quality,” he explained to me . 

I was only trying to go 60-40 with him this one time but he wouldn’t budge. He remained my middleman for the next couple weeks but the seed had been planted in my mind was growing. If he hadn’t named the specific street corner then he might still be taxing me today, but he was pissed and I don’t think he considered that I would actually do it. 

Two weeks after the argument I was having trouble meeting up with him. I’m not sure what was going on but he kept giving me the run around during the day and finally answering at night saying we were all set for tomorrow. I’d call the next day only to be hit with the same games. I put up with this the first two days but on the third day when I couldn’t get a hold of him I had had enough. I plugged Appleton and Elm street into my phone’s GPS and headed off unsure of what to expect.

An hour later I arrived in the small city (pop. under 150,000) which was considered by most people “in the know” to be the heroin capital of the state. There were a handful of far bigger cities but none boasted the reputation of this one in particular. Per capita it was unquestionably the “dirtiest” city in the state, probably the whole region. 

The signs of dope were everywhere from the mattresses in the alleyways to the no loitering signs which were as common as street signs. The most obvious and impossible to ignore was the drug paraphernalia which littered the city. I joked to a friend that if you’re looking to score its just a matter of pulling a ghetto version of Hensel and Grettel; just follow the needle caps and empty bags instead of pieces of candy and you’ll be heading home in no time.

I didn’t know that then though. I had no clue just how prevalent the heroin scene was and I thought without my little address I would have been hopeless. When I’d pick-up with my middleman Peroin we didn’t head towards the downtown area but kept to the outskirts where his connects were plenty and the risk much lower. I was surprised when I was still blocks from my  
destination to be getting down-right stared at by people hanging on corners and in front of bodegas. I had a feeling they could help me out but I decided to just see what was awaiting me at my destination. I park a block away and walk to the corner. I saw either a black or spanish teenager hanging out of all three entryways to the rundown section-8 housing building that stood at the corner. I was floored when they each asked me variations of one question - “What ya need?” 

I was weary of buying inferior product and wasn’t sure if the $50 price I was used to would hold but I wasn’t so dumb as to not at least pretend to know that that was the price everywhere. It seemed like it could be - $50, 10 bags, $5 a piece it sure made sense. So I went up to one of the dope boys, stepped inside with him, and told him I would buy 4 bags now and come back and get 6 more if it was good. He said fine and I handed him a twenty as he handed me the four bags with a Coca-Cola stamp on them.

I was in disbelief at how easy that was and quickly realized that if the dope’s straight my main worry will be the police. I had asked for a number but he said they don’t really use phones, just that someone will always be there. I wasn’t about to bring up the police so I figured I could worry about that later. I got back to my car and found a safe place to get high. Peroin was partly right, the dope wasn’t as good, but it was much closer than I expected, I couldn’t have been happier when I returned and bought the last 6 bags and it was the same product as the first four, I was a little worried he’s screw me on the last 6.

I figured Peroin must have been lying about taking him two years before being so well connected, I had only hit one spot and already had dope that was %80 as good, I mean some of these dudes must have phones and I can just get a number next time. I felt bad for Peroin in a way, his habit was out of control and considering I often pooled other kid’s money and scored through him multiple times a week he would be out around 35-40 bags a week. That’s the game for ya.

I felt such a rush, not even from the drugs, but just the knowledge that I only needed money now, no word from a dealer, and I could score whenever. I would later regret not just being able to delete a number in my phone and rid myself of ways to get high. Once you know you can cold-cop its an ever-present temptation. Its similiar to russian roulette with a 100 chamber gun and a bullet, there was a risk but it usually worked out. It wouldn’t be long before my new way to get dope would take its toll on my life.

On Tuesday(7th) my friend (I'll call her lizzy), told me she was going to come by & swoop me up and I'd spend the night for a day or two. We lived 45 minutes away from each other, so I was excited to see her.  She had told me in rehab about this way she sometimes commits credit card fraud.  Lizzy makes new cards & IDs with their names, she's been doing it *successfully* for years.  


Lizzy told me her & a friend were picking up some dope & then come get me.  
*Now lizzy's DOC was tweak/ice/meth.  Which she hadn't done since she got out of rehab.*  

Lizzy then tells me it's too hot to stop & get me & she will get me later.  I ask her how much later & no reply.  *Four days* with no answer & phone off.  Third day I text her boyfriend, who is still sober, he hasn't heard from lizzy since midnight on Tuesday. I haven't since 8.30 on Tuesday.  

I'm talking to another friend how I'm worried she overdosed or something.  He tells me to look her name up on the inmate info site.  I do & she's there!  Booked on the 8th for a felony, her bail is 30,000.  When my ex got arrested with 3GS of dope his bail was 1,000.  It has to be the credit card fraud she was caught up in.


This is my *second* close call.  My first was with my ex a month ago.  If she hadn't been too busy tweaking, I would have been with her!  Lizzy told me she had the cards all ready.  I was stupidly totally down.

I live with family in an amazing house and they are jsut always there for me, but they dont really know whats going on. All of the bruises on my arms and hands I get to blame on being in the hospital and stuck to much. Last time I went in, over Christmas my mom came to the emergency room with me. They couldn't find anything, hit my arms, hands, feet, neck..They ended up have to draw blood from my femoral artery. Thank god no one saw the bruises on my thighs, those would be kind of unexplainable, though I do use Humira and IM into my thigh..I tell my parents Im doing fine! and suck it up to go visit my three nieces. I love them to death but so much noise and crying comes from a 3 years old and two 1 year old twins. When going throug w/ds im sure some of you know what I mean. I just got insurance through obama care which is great. I ask the rents if I could go talk to someone now and they are completely down with that. Part of me thinks they know whats going on. My mom found a syringe once and many many orange caps. I told here it was from the time i got sent home with Insulin from being on prednisone for so long, steroid induced diabetes. They know for a fact I have had issues with pain meds in the past and originally moved here on subs, but frequent flareups put me back on the dialudid which is really the only thing that works besides stronger stuff. I have been on it all, fro codeine, to percs, opana, fent, whatever, all prescribed. Some would call that a blessing but here I am on a saturday and I dont get to see my doc till next friday. I have a xbox one to mess with, I have a great dog, I have family and friends to see when my arms heal up enough for me to feel comfortable. Yet when im in withdrawals I just want to sleep and not move. I feel a little better each day but even by next Thursday I will still have this haze about me, then Friday morning will come, and bam, happy happy me.

And I still do.  

But recently I bought a new computer for myself, and I've literally become addicted to Fallout once again.  It's more addicting than Heroin to me.  back when Fallout 3 came out I would just take codeine and smoke and play it all night, I'd always brush off friends and roommates wanting to chill so I could just play.  

In about a week and a half, I've spent nearly 50 hours playing New Vegas, installing mods, making everything compatible with the shiniest and most impressive graphics my computer can handle.  I've never played a better game.  I love taking aerosol methamphetamine, IV morphine, 2C series research chems, and fictional super drugs and then blowing like five people to bits in the sand, with accompanying psychedelic visuals.  The other day I went to some camp full of doctors in the ghetto and I got loaded on chems, pulled out a rifle, and started blasting peoples' brains out, while my character was tripping and hallucinating.  At one point I blasted some bitch with my shotgun, then walked over her and blew her head open right as my character experienced a color shift, changing her blood and brains from red to blue, then yellow and back to an extremely bright red.  Then I shot some kid outside the gates and started eating the flesh where his head got blown off his shoulders.  

I also like chopping people to pieces with the chainsaw and scattering their body parts across the room.  What do you guys like to do when you're high?",1389469468.0

Long time lurker here, finally decided to make an account, and figured after all the knowledge, experience and entertainment I've got from you guys, it is my turn to contribute something. 

First off anyone who says PST is a waste of time, is wrong. I'm from Minneapolis and have a pretty decent tolerance to tar and all opiates. But being as I can only get those when i'm back in the cities, and go to school at Iowa State, I've been continuing my favorite habit and activity using the only source I can get down here - PST. I've been doing this for 4 years now, and have tried every method possible. I know it's been said before and I'm just going to reiterate that the best method is the most simple one.

I need about 800 grams of good seeds to be high for a day, if you want to know more about the effects let me know and i'll share. 

800grams is TOO much for a normal 2 liter. At the dollar store they sell crap 2.5 liters of pop which are perfect. Weigh out your seeds on a food scale and use a funnel to get the into the 2.5 liter. Next add just enough water so you can shake it around and it's not sludgy and everything is flowing. I've tried adding lemon, and all the other addities mentioned and nothing really enhances the absorption.The best way to get the most out of them is to not let the water sit and be absorbed. As soon as the water is in the bottle violently shake it for about 3-4 minutes.  That's all you need, no more. As soon as you're done shaking untwist the cap half way so it doesn't come off but lets water out and squeeze it all out into a cup. I use a beer mug and it's perfect. I don't mind the taste, but most times I will still chase it a little bit with the soda that comes out of the 2.5 liter so It doesn't go to complete waste.  If you drink this on an empty stomache you should feel the effects within 10 minutes. I always add more water and do a second wash, but find that a third is completely unnecessary. 

If anyone has any questions relating to tolerance, effects, combinations with benzo's, anything like that please let me know! Like I said it's not my preferred opiate, but being down in Iowa for school it's all I have and I much prefer it to something like hydrocodone.

Super long, maybe not super interesting.","  I wake up to my iphone vibrating on my bed squealing a sound I hate more than the waking up itself. I reach over and touch the snooze box. Next thing I know I am rolling out of bed and its 9am, 1 hour late for work. ""Shit"" I think to myself. Call the boss and tell him ill be late as I light my first cigarette of the day. If you dont count the 3 I nodded out with in the wee hours of the morning that is.. I scramble to the kitchen to see whats left of my dope. ""Fuck"" I whisper under my breathe. A couple lines. I decide to have a shower before I indulge. The shower is warm, for a moment im not thinking about dope, im happy, I have always loved water. When I was younger I would spend hours swimming in the lake at my grammas cabin. Seems like a lifetime ago. To think of a time when I didnt need drugs to enjoy myself. Sometimes I dont even think im addicted to dope itself. Im addicted to getting high. Im addicted to not being myself. I dont like myself. I dry off quickly and start getting dressed. Slip my silver diamond studded Bulova watch on my wrist while untangling my gold chain atop the dresser. Grab a dirty polo sweater off the floor and and run my hand through my damp hair. ""Fuck this"" I think as I pack my one hitter with some low quality weed. I remember I have a red bull in the fridge. Thatll help. I crack it and take a gulp. By this time I cant imagine not snorting some of that powder. I pour it all out disappointed at the amount in front me. For a brief second I swear under my breathe at my friend who fucked me over last night. I went all the way downtown to give HIS buddy the money I owed him. He promised his buddy would have a half gram for me on front. When i get there the guy is 20 minutes away (of course). I wait. When he finally shows up hes not holding. Said he was never told about any half grams. I call my buddy who then loses his shit saying hes sleeping. I almost break down in fucking tears. Fucking tears knowing I wont have enough to get me through work tomorrow. Aaand Im back to today... I do my line and feel 1/10th better about life. Better enough to slip on my italian leather loafers and hit the command start to my new car. They call me a functioning addict. I call myself a broken piece of society. I am better than you, average person. When I am high, I am empathetic, caring, funny, confident, I care. Some people use dope not to feel, I use it to feel. When I am sober im cold. I am not a good person. Dope makes me feel, makes me love. Dope Makes me human. When im not high I am nothing. My car means nothing. My job with chances to make thousands in a day means nothing. My clothes mean nothing. That man on the street freezing asking for a dollar for coffee means nothing. They have the audacity to use functioning to define me? I function like an old car on the brink of its last Mile. Burning fuel till it needs to be filled. I burn my bridges and snort my dope, till the dope needs to be refilled and the bridges rebuilt. One of those two things just doesn't happen after a while... And i ALWAYS refill my dope.

I have enough in my stash to last me until sometime tomorrow, plus 2 2mg suboxone strips.  I've tapered before after a month-long binge of snorting 20-25mg opana lines (once a day) with success.  I had more subs though too.

I dosed H for the first time a couple days ago, plus I've been mixing with the oxymorphone occasionally.

Given all that, my question centers around tapering and withdrawal management.  Pretty much, how long should I wait (after my last dose, which will be OM or boy) to start with the subs?

This binge has only been a little over a week, so I'm not too worried about physical withdrawals.  Any tapering guidelines too?  I was thinking about either taking one then the next sometime the following day or doing something like 2, 1, 1/2, 1/2 (days separated by commas).",1389545043.0

Think of any decision you’ve ever made which had a bearing on your future: I may be wrong, but I don’t see how it could have been anything but a choice however indirect — between the two things I’ve mentioned: the floating or the swimming.The answer — and, in a sense, the tragedy of life — is that we seek to understand the goal and not the man. We set up a goal which demands of us certain things: and we do these things. We adjust to the demands of a concept which CANNOT be valid. When you were young, let us say that you wanted to be a fireman. I feel reasonably safe in saying that you no longer want to be a fireman. Why? Because your perspective has changed. It’s not the fireman who has changed, but you.Every man is the sum total of his reactions to experience. As your experiences differ and multiply, you become a different man, and hence your perspective changes. This goes on and on. Every reaction is a learning process; every significant experience alters your perspective.

So it would seem foolish, would it not, to adjust our lives to the demands of a goal we see from a different angle every day? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything other than galloping neurosis?

The answer, then, must not deal with goals at all, or not with tangible goals, anyway. It would take reams of paper to develop this subject to fulfillment. God only knows how many books have been written on “the meaning of man” and that sort of thing, and god only knows how many people have pondered the subject. (I use the term “god only knows” purely as an expression.)* There’s very little sense in my trying to give it up to you in the proverbial nutshell, because I’m the first to admit my absolute lack of qualifications for reducing the meaning of life to one or two paragraphs.To put our faith in tangible goals would seem to be, at best, unwise. So we do not strive to be firemen, we do not strive to be bankers, nor policemen, nor doctors. WE STRIVE TO BE OURSELVES.

But don’t misunderstand me. I don’t mean that we can’t BE firemen, bankers, or doctors—but that we must make the goal conform to the individual, rather than make the individual conform to the goal. In every man, heredity and environment have combined to produce a creature of certain abilities and desires—including a deeply ingrained need to function in such a way that his life will be MEANINGFUL. A man has to BE something; he has to matter.

As I see it then, the formula runs something like this: a man must choose a path which will let his ABILITIES function at maximum efficiency toward the gratification of his DESIRES. In doing this, he is fulfilling a need (giving himself identity by functioning in a set pattern toward a set goal) he avoids frustrating his potential (choosing a path which puts no limit on his self-development), and he avoids the terror of seeing his goal wilt or lose its charm as he draws closer to it (rather than bending himself to meet the demands of that which he seeks, he has bent his goal to conform to his own abilities and desires).

In short, he has not dedicated his life to reaching a pre-defined goal, but he has rather chosen a way of life he KNOWS he will enjoy. The goal is absolutely secondary: it is the functioning toward the goal which is important. And it seems almost ridiculous to say that a man MUST function in a pattern of his own choosing; for to let another man define your own goals is to give up one of the most meaningful aspects of life — the definitive act of will which makes a man an individualA man who procrastinates in his CHOOSING will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstance. So if you now number yourself among the disenchanted, then you have no choice but to accept things as they are, or to seriously seek something else. But beware of looking for goals: look for a way of life. Decide how you want to live and then see what you can do to make a living WITHIN that way of life. But you say, “I don’t know where to look; I don’t know what to look for.”

And there’s the crux. Is it worth giving up what I have to look for something better? I don’t know—is it? Who can make that decision but you? But even by DECIDING TO LOOK, you go a long way toward making the choice.I’m not trying to send you out “on the road” in search of Valhalla, but merely pointing out that it is not necessary to accept the choices handed down to you by life as you know it. There is more to it than that — no one HAS to do something he doesn’t want to do for the rest of his life.


TL;DR. Float or swim, either way choose, or the choice will be made for you.",1389542805.0

I have been trying to educate and explain to her what its really like, why I do it etc, but cant. I am beginning to believe it is impossible to get someone who has never used, to understand.

Support at home is very erratic at best. One minute I feel like she will be the backbone of my support. The next, kaboom. One of us explodes, mainly me, and we end up arguing like fuck. It culminated today with me storming out the back, then launching a bike through the air, smashing the gate in the process.

Considering this was one handed, I was quite impressed. I guess I am finding this harder than I expected.

Now I am in no way delusional enough to believe it was gonna be easy. But on the other hand, hoped my wife would begin to understand what its like.

I even brought her a pack of home heroin testing kits, just as a way of helping her trust me. Yet its not that easy, I really fucked up this time.

All I want to do right now, is go out and grab a couple of bags. But I can't, I gotta try to fix this. That would only make it worse.

I find the way mods influence subs and forums interesting. Some mods follow a ""hands off"" policy and let the community regulate itself(r/atheist). Problem here is that instigators/trolls attack us. They come here looking for fights. Mods would have a easier job if we all ignore the comments. Assholes will always find a way to insult us. We are easy targets and usually give them the fight they want. Banning them is only an short term answer because they make new accounts. We should help the mods out by giving the dbags the silent treatment and just down voting them. Assuming the sub continues growing at the same rate, the amount of trolling will explode. Following the same MO, Mods will be banning many more posters and giving shrinking amounts of thought to the reasons why.  For example, a community member debating an unpopular opinion might be banned over a misunderstanding. Personally I love reading other members tear apart self righteous narcissist who thinks we are the scum of the world. I say the less moderation the better. I love this place the way it is. What do you guys think the best solution is? Hands off? More moderation? Silent treatment? I'm just high and no one else thinks there is an issue?? Let me know!!

I have some H on me and I'd like to try shooting it for the first time. I've injected things before and I've been a long time opiate fan but I've never done both. In the past I've mostly stuck to pills, oxycodone vicodin etc. Unfortunately my pill connection has dried up and instead I've come into  a dope connection. Last month a bought a gram and snorted it in 3 sittings spaced about a week apart. It felt pretty good but I never quite reached the same level of euphoria that say 60mg oxy give me. 

This month I got another 0.5gr and over the past weekend found that snorting really wasn't cutting it anymore. I took about 300mgs and while I felt a little warm there definitely wasn't the sense of euphoria that I normally enjoy from opiates.

Tonight I got ready to shoot 50-100mg of the remaining 200mg but after adding the water got a little hesitant. The h is a light brown powder and when I mixed it with water instead of fully dissolving the water turned a murky brown color with a visible sediment at the bottom. I heated the solution up and drew it up through a small cotton ball but the murkyness remained.

So what do you guys think? Obviously if the powder doesn't entirely dissolve then it must be cut with something. I thought that the heat would at least dissolve the sediment but the water started to turn to vapor and the powder remained.

So what do you guys think?

I have heard so many great things about subs, but I'm in a small town in Canada, so I cannot find any for the life of me. Is there a directory of clinics that would give subs out in Canada?

This no longer works for my pain. well it kind of does, I mean I was a mess before the script, now I can at least get to sleep, often it is not easy still. 

I brought it up to my doc 2 months ago, that they dont work as well any more. HE suggested a tolerance break, but I told him I would no be comfortable going 2-3 weeks in such pain. He then said that he gauges increase pills on a level of functionality. HE says, and its true, I can mostly function through the day, but im hurting still. 

Just want some advice how to approach this. I dont want him to think im seeking it out, although he knows im hurting I mean its documented condition. I want to get something higher. Ive asked once and he denied me, if I ask again will it look bad?",1389764183.0

(Yes, I know shame on me) So 2 weeks ago I go to my monthly dr appointment (Dr is in the office for 1-2 hours ONCE a week), fork over $300 (I know its alot, but its alotttt cheaper than my previous habit and this actually HELPS me) grab my script and head over to the pharmacy. Since this Obama care shit has kicked in I always have to have prior authorizations (PA) -for those of you who are not familiar with what this consists of - I have to have clean urine, counseling, and this paperwork has to be sent to my branch of Medicaid every month for approval. I have never flunked a urine test & you may call this conceded but I see myself as an amazing patient. I do what I am told & never think of doing otherwise. So the pharmacist comes over to me and says I need a PA. I was thrown off because the previous month my PA went through for at least 3 months, so I should not need a new one?! I go back home make some phone calls and I am told that Medicaid only allows their patients to be one this medicine 12 months. I was NEVER told this. (and please, don't comment if you are going to tell me I should have gone down myself or anything like that) They let us know we can appeal this, yadda yadda. So to start that process I have to ask the Dr office to do a few things and fax it to Medicaid. The only way Medicaid will pay for even SOME of the medicine is if 1. The appeal is approved, obviously. & 2. My Dr office comes up with a 6-12 month plan for me to get off the meds. 

Needless to say, this clinic is in it for the money only. And I cannot afford to go to another clinic (if I can even find one) for awhile. I have been scrounging up enough money to buy a few at a time from the pharmacy but I personally feel like this is messing up my recovery. I feel as if they abandoned me. They built me up, made me trust them, and now they are dropping me on my ass to fend for myself. I really don't know what to do... Anybody have any suggestions? I live in Louisiana but I would like to know if anybody, anywhere has gone through this.

Thanks for reading this(: & I am sorry for the scatter brained post.

If you use, be proactive, drink polyethylene glycol (miralax) daily, with out fail to prevent constipation all together.

my grandma supports me (i'm 24 but just how it is right now due to my drug problem) and pays my insurance premium; she's been after me to go to a doctor due to my mental instability and lack of menses (sorry to the menz), but i don't want her to know that i'm trying to enter a suboxone program specifically, so i told her i want to enter a mental health treatment program. 

she's fine helping me pay for all this, but finances are kinda tight for the rest of the month, so i'm trying to find out how much all this will cost since she can only fork over maybe 200 right now. i called BCBS and they told me they can't say for sure until i talk to the people at the program, but i would basically have to pay $250 of the $350 intake, and they would cover the rest thereafter; also they said no copay for an office visit, which is what i am assuming this will be. they also mentioned something confusing about paying 50% of something and the other 50%, i am responsible for.

i was just wondering what your experiences were entering a sub program (or even better, which i would do if i could find a damn provider, is find a private psychiatrist licensed to prescribe outside of the restrictions of a program), how much it cost you (with insurance or without, i'm curious), and how much benefit you have received from it. my dope habit is out of control on both a financial and physical level, and it is destroying my relationship with my awesome grandma, and destroying me inside. 

any input would be appreciated because it shouldn't be this hard to find a legit, affordable (with insurance) program in chicago. also, i tried asking the insurance company to direct me specifically to a suboxone/buprenorphine doctor and they had absolutely no clue what i was talking about. oh and, some doctors i've called are actually out of network (as though blue cross is some janky bullshit insurance).

The article from CNN hasn't been posted yet, as they just ran the story. I'll post the article as soon as it is uploaded. 

Until then, I'll write my own story paraphrasing what I heard;

Police in Broward and surrounding counties say they've made more heroin arrests in the last 3 years than in the previous 10 years combined. 

Since the state launched a crackdown on  pain management clinics in 2008, and implemented a prescription drug monitoring system (making doctor-shopping much more difficult), pill users have found it much harder to find their drug of choice. If the pills can be found, prices are usually so high that most can't afford enough to feed their habit. 

As a result, thousands of former pill-popping Floridians have turned to heroin, the supply of which is more available than ever, as dealers recognize the increasing demand and smuggle more product into the state. 

It would seem as though state and federal officials didn't see this coming as a consequence of their strict crackdown on pain management clinics. 

There has been such a negative stigma attached to prescription painkillers, many legitimate physicians are reluctant to prescribe them, causing patients who actually need the medications for chronic pain to resort to measures they never thought they would have to. ",1389832314.0

1vfptv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1vfptv/cold_copping_stories/,22,https://redd.it/1vfptv,MisterMcNod,Cold Copping Stories,"Hello all, Long time lurker, first time posting on this sub. I have a few crazy Cold Copping stories and would love to hear yours. I was curious if anyone has ever been busted on the streets as everyone I know usually says, ""oh they are after the Dealers not the buyers"". I have two very close calls to tell you about.

Preface:

I copped on the streets of SF everyday for about 3 years and was never thrown in jail, but have been ""caught"". SF is a crazy liberal city and unlike most open air markets the block is literally a five minute walk from the main tourist hub. Normal people live on the block and although it seems rough and tough it really isn't. Almost everyone you meet on the block is involved in the trade. people cop in suits, athletic outfits, and from all sides of life. There are cops everywhere, but it doesn't deter anyone. My theory is that they realize people are going to be using drugs in SF (its the druggiest city I've ever been to, EVERYONE uses drugs there; I've given ecstasy to presidents of huge companies, gotten stoned in front of cops, all of my friends were wealthy yuppies and were on one drug or another every weekend and easily stoned within 30 minutes of getting off work, etc.) and so by keeping the TL (I can remove the name of the area if the mods think it's giving away where to go, I.E. sourcing) open for business they are keeping it all in one place and easily accessible. If they started busting people there the market would move into the Nice neighborhoods and lower their property values so instead they all keep in one designated area where the SROs are and so property values don't matter. If they do need to meet quotas they know where the dealers are and can bust a few people. I actually think it's genius, they act like the drug war is awful and protect the city  from real criminals and let the druggies ruin there lives in the designated life ruining zone. Well that's the preface here is the tame story first.

1.

I was walking around the block and ran into a guy who said he had OP 60s (the red ones) so I ask for 2 for $30 and before i give the cash i want to see it so i ask him to show me them. He pulls them out and they are actually OP 30s (kind of brownish pink). I tell him they aren't 60s and he is trying to tell me they are. Then boom cops have their sirens running. And since I didn't buy anything yet I don't think they can arrest me for anything. They give me a million questions, but tell the dealer to go away. The cop was super nice; when he asked me what i was doing in the TL I said, Going for a walk"" to which he said, ""you think I'm stupid, I've been out here everyday for ten years, you think I don't know what you're doing here?"" Anyway after he berates me a bit he hands me an NA pamphlet and tells me to call my sponsor and I walk away. The next story boggles my mind though.

2.

I walk to the block and see a green van that I am familiar with. A punk young kid is standing in front of it hawking Op 80s. There is a cop car parked accross the street, which should have been my sign this was a bad idea, but  was WDing. Buy 4 from the kid then round the corner. I put the pills in my wallet and walk down the road. A block later I see a cop car at the stoplight in front of me. I see cops there all the time so i don't worry. Then it starts slowly crossing the street and I think, ""well I'm going to jail, bummer"" as i reach the crosswalk it stops in front of me and one cop yells at me, ""you hear any gunshots?"" I think it is a pretty smart way to handle busting someone, cuz at that time I thought oh, they aren't looking for me, so I wouldn't think about ditching the stash or swallowing it. They get out of car and tell me to stand against the wall hands on head. They ask me about the green van. I have dealt with cops before and know that I don't have tot tell them shit, which is probably what saved me. One thing I remember them saying to me was, ""we don't want you we just want the guy in the green Van because he is a dealer, so tell us what he sold u."" I keep denying i have any Idea what they are talking about. they start searching me and this is where shit gets nuts. The pills are in my wallet not in a hidden compartment , just out in the open. They search my entire wallet and don't find the pills. I have no fucking clue how they didn't find them. I saw them pull out my IDs my credit cards my money everything, but they don't ask about the four green pills next to the money they pulled out. The only thing I can imagine, other than GOD blinding them, would be that they were serious when they said they only wanted to know what i bought so they could get the dealer. None of it makes sense to me how I got away.

Lastly I moved to LA recently and LA is 1,000 times scarier than Sfs market. I could go to the TL whenever I wanted and was never worried about getting popped or jumped. In LA I am so scared every single time. There are literally thousands of homeless people everywhere whereas SF most of the people in the TL took the BART over from their houses in Oakland. Very rarely did I see anyone actually sleeping on the streets. I don't know how the cops in LA are either. like for anyone who has been doing this, do they bust people all the time or never? Are they only going after dealers? The one upside is the H is great in LA whereas in SF in the TL it was always awful which is why I bought OP80s as would be guaranteed a certain quality.

Sorry for rambling. My questions is, anyone have any good copping stories? Anyone been busted? Anyone been hurt? What are the open markets in other cities like. ",1389950316.0
1vfoip,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1vfoip/how_much_do_you_pay_for_your_dope/,34,https://redd.it/1vfoip,PBateman99,How much do you pay for your dope?,"EDIT: I appreciate the quick responses but dollars per weight doesn't really describe how much bang you're getting for your buck. So exactly how much you use in a sitting? If you pay $120/g and can get high 4 times off of it it's a lot different than going through two $60 1g bags in one sitting.

I've never had a consistent source of h and have found prices to be extremely variable here on the east coast. I was wondering what a general rule of street pricing might be in your area. Mostly wondering about your run of the mill white to brown powder rather than BTH.

Last month I got about 1g of some pretty weak h for $90. It was a light brown powder. Snorting approx 300mg would give me a warm calming buzz but nothing mindblowing. 

Later I got 0.5g of more a light brown powder. 200mg of which I tried dissolving in water and found a lot of sediment. 

Today I paid $60 but didn't really check out what was in the bag till I got home. Looking inside the bag there 2 solid brown rocks weighing 150mg. Shit I thought I got had. I've never paid so much for so little. I crushed it up a snorted 1/3 and felt great. Better than the 300mg of last month's stuff. (I believe the drip was a little numbing but that could just have been in my head.)

I know that it's nearly impossible to determine purity and I suspect that powders are more likely to be cut than rocks. That said, I figure almost anything can be pressed into a hard solid.

So for all you pros out there, generally how do you tell what's bad, what's good and what's great?

A few obvious variables I'd like you to address are:
  First, color and consistency. (whiter vs. browner, granular vs fluffy)
  Second, solubility in water. (how much settles when mixed with bacteriostatic water)

Also, what are common cutting agents you think or know you've encountered? I realize people always mention fentanyl but I suspect most are cheaper and inert.

The first time I shot up however: I passed out and woke up an hour later feeling pretty damn sober and sick. 

It's been two weeks of on-off use now and it's still the same. I shoot up, get an amazing euphoric rush, feel really good for a half hour, and then it starts to taper and I'm feeling sick after an hour's past. 

I should also mention I've tried two different sources of dope to be sure one wasn't just fentanyl. There both brown powders too, positively #4.

Long story short i average about 40 mg of Opana IR and sometimes on top of Opana 20 mg ER for Chronic back pain in my Thoracic spine.. feels like my heart is being crushed and my rib broken..  Opana works so great for my pain but recently my doctor has left his practice leaving me high and Dry.. so while i get a new doctor i decided to detox.. Plus i suffer from cluster headaches and the day i stopped the opana was making my headache worse.. so i switched to NorCos i had laying around and as soon as i swallowed them i puked them right up.. so i said hell with it im going to jump off this train.. i have detoxed from the following.  Xanax, Ambiem, SSRI and Neurontin at 900mg x 4 times a day... and all of those were horrible..  my skin pruned up.. i had painful erections and the thought of just taking a pill to end my hell was on my mind all day long.. so depressed.. the shower hurt my skin and i got over it.. Xanax was the longest and most painful..  So i was ready for hell when i jumped off the opana train and now at day 6 nothing..  i think my foot got cold.. and my back shivered for a half second on day 2...  but that was it..   Still no cravings, but my back is hurting like hell so eventually i'm going to have something done to fix my disc..  remove a rib and go in and try and replace that disc... But what is going on?  why didn't i go into hell?  if i took 20 mg of opana and ate some high fat food i would nod right out..  so it did work for me and it worked awesome.. Cadillac of pain meds..  I'm going to post this on Bluelight soon to see what kind of response i get.. there is an archive there that said another person had the same luck as me.. i'm also thinking of doing the genetic test through 23andme to see if i have a certain genetic code that doesn't allow for addiction to opiates.. its one of their standard test. i have the empty bottles as sort of proof of my use.  i never sold one or shared any as i needed everyone for pain management..  now i hated using around the clock because i cant sleep on them with all my sleep issues so my doctor was find with just Opana IR..    i still have a bottle left and no urge to get into it.  Anyone else know of anyone that can use daily never missing for 6 years and then just walk away..  i still crave cigarette's after stopping for 7 years now.. so i know addiction..  Just looking for an answer.. thanks.

At this point I hadn't really touched an opiate in a year or so but had been reading about cold water extraction on the internet.

I had just gotten a root canal in mexico so i had the perfect setup

""aw man my teeth are killing me from this damn root canal but my mexican dentist wouldnt prescribe me nothing cuz i had to cross the border, this sucks...""

""Did you ever share or reuse a needle?""

Unfortunately, my answer to BOTH questions was yes. He then informed me of a rare infection in which the abscess can travel from your arm, into your spinal cord. He says he has a strong suspicion that that is what is going on with me. 

He did some bloodwork and I am having a scan done. If it is in fact this type of infection, I will need surgery to drain the abscess and have to be on long term antibiotics. 

It could be much, much worse, but spinal surgery is no joke.

The night before I had acquired a small greyish-blue pill with the letters OC stamped on one side and the number 80 on the other. The letters refer to the name-brand of the painkiller, OxyContin, and the numbers refer to the strength, 80 milligrams in this case. 

My relationship with opiates was at the tail end of the getting-to-know-each-other phase, I still had money, no real tolerance, and most importantly a lack of what the word withdrawal meant. I had tried them 8 months ago at the beginning of my senior year. I had split this very same pill between three other friends the morning after a wild party. We had all been wasted and woke up very miserable until one friend mentioned that he knew for a way to get us all better.

Better didn’t even begin to describe how I felt that morning. We melted into the couches we sat upon while itching our bodies as if that itself was what released the bliss. Only two of us were familiar with the feeling and I was not one of them. 

“Jesus, is it like this every time?” I croaked out, with a hint of fear at knowing the answer.

“Every time,” was all I heard in reply, unsure of who said it considering I had only one eye open trying to focus on a movie, the voice wasn’t familiar but rather a scratchy voice of a stranger.

I didn’t even respond, I felt too good to bother talking at the moment. The iced coffee I sipped on was unbelievably perfect, I felt such gratitude to whoever had made my coffee - just the right amount of cream and sugar - and I drank it slowly enjoying every sip. 

I had experimented with psychedelics but the pure ecstasy I felt and empathy I thought with trumped any trip-induced epiphany that I had experienced before hand. This was just *it.* I had such an overwhelming feeling of love for not only me and my friends but for everyone I knew that I forgave all wrongs done to me and even myself for others I had wronged. I knew deep down that it was just the drugs talking but another part of me didn’t care what it was. I was at peace. 

And the high never ended! I pulled out my phone to shoot off a text to my Mom to let her know I wouldn’t be home for another night, not caring if she got mad, what the fuck was “mad” anyways, why waste time in life being “mad.” I looked around and no one was talking, we were all too caught up with focusing on what we were feeling, the pure pleasure of our glorious existence. I drifted off to someplace in between sleep and consciousness waking to the theme in Avatar playing at different points, the DVD player waiting for someone to hit play.

I didn’t dive head first into opiates after that one day. I was a good enough student minus the effort. I was college bound and had to make sure that I didn’t mess that up, but as far as academics went that was all I was worried about - not totally fucking it up. I played basketball which delayed my then recreational drug use. I simply could not play basketball the same day I got high without throwing up. After it happening twice I put an end to the pills for a few months. I had used them probably twenty times up to that point. 

When basketball ended I jumped right back into the pill world with its straws and hose-clamps, its beautiful pills and high cost, its cool lingo and tight bonds they made between my friends and I. I had known a few older kids who had gotten bad habits but those kids were for the most part not the same person I was then, they never gave a shit about anything as far as I could tell. 

It was near the end of my senior year and I had used oxys probably 40 times by now. I had gone from 20 mgs, to 27 mgs (split three way) and had gotten rocked off of 40mgs a couple of times by now.

That brings me back to jumping out of bed that day. In the state I went to school if you were in the physics class the amusement park Six Flags opened their doors for a free day of rides for students only. I woke up that morning with a half of an 80. I shaved it slowly, turning the pill into  as much powder I could. I grabbed my third of a Dunkin Donuts straw and slowly sniffed the very nice sized line in front of me. By the time I got out of the shower I was really fucking high.

I got to school and headed towards my physics class excited for the short ride lines and hoping the adrenaline of rides like Superman wouldn’t kill my high. We piled into the van and I walked passed the only person I was actually friends with in the class, Ashley. Most of the kids were perfectly straight laced, and thinking back me and Ashley may have been the only two who weren’t, though she only drank.

She stood an inch taller than me at 5’ 9” and also played on the basketball team though she was god-awful. Just for college ya know? she told me one day. Her legs went on for what looked like a mile until her tan skin melted into the short white shorts she had on. Her blond hair touched her mid-back and even through the oxy left in my nose I could smell her undoubtedly expensive shampoo. Her shirt had a deep cut V in it exposing the very edges of her breasts, not large but with such a nice curve and such a full look that they couldn’t help but make you take a glance. She wasn’t skinny even though she ran every single day, but her body was toned and no one could argue the great shape she was in. She wore huge sunglasses over her long face hiding her eyes and looking somewhat ridiculous. I quickly poked fun at them and she gave me a smile.

I had no desire for her to see me nod off and I sat in the back keeping to myself. The hour drive flew by but I had drank two Red-bulls and was somewhat awake. I grabbed Ashley’s arm when we got inside and said one word to her “Superman.” I told her I’ll run ahead and save our place and headed there.

I was still flying high and couldn’t wait to get on Superman and was wondering where the fuck Ashley was. I was two spots away from the front seats when she finally came up behind me, “Hi Steven” I heard, oh yeah did I mention she was pretty dang awkward? Thank god she was because it made her so much more likeable, and her looks so much less intimidating.

We made small talk about how much our teacher sucked at driving and whether or not we were going to do the worksheet we were handed, me of course saying no and her saying yes. I promised her we would copy someone’s before leaving and then it was our turn for the ride.

We inched our way up the track, supposed to be the biggest rollercoaster on the east coast or some shit, and I felt another drug mix with my oxy - adrenaline. I reached over and grabbed Ashley’s hand, giving her a wink, Jesus was I a smoother guy on drugs. She squeezed my hand and smiled at me, I was stoked.

We had never so much as kissed but we did get along together really well. I couldn’t believe it when I walked into our second test of the year and she handed me a full page of notes for it. We were allowed one page of notes and she knew I wouldn’t bother writing them after not having them for the first test, and she did it for every single test of the year, not saying a word as she handed them to me. She had an older guy she was still talking with even though he had cheated on her, and I was a senior-guy and had a fling with a freshman girl. She really wasn’t interested in me and did the notes thing cuz she was just a nice person and we were friends.. I sometimes made fun of her a bit too much, noticing when she would get pissed off. But more often she would laugh with me. We were lab partners twice every week after I begged her not to leave me stuck with Rahul. She was nice. I would always ask why trys so hard in school and tell her she can marry anyone she wants, my awkward way of telling her how gorgeous she was without having to say the actual words.

As we reached the top of the climb I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I knew I didn’t *really* have feelings for her, because she didn’t for me, but the drugs were trying to convince me otherwise. We screamed and laughed until the ride was over and then rode it again.

The rest of the day I was smoother than I had ever been, I was the guy I dreamed I always was, and it was the OC doing the work for me. I was in the zone like I never had been and was truly on a roll. We were getting along so well that I thought about trying to actually lead her somewhere we could be alone. I wondered where we could go. I finally noticed that the water park wasn’t opened yet and that it was just roped off with one guy watching the area. I waited for him to walk away and brought Ashley over.

“Steve, what are you doing?” 

“Just, uh, you know, well we’ve had fun today I thought we could make it a memorable day,” I told her reaching for her hand.

“How, by hooking up in the water park? Are you serious?”

“Yeah Ashley, we’re 18 who gives a fuck, better than in the back of a car with the Clantin cousings isn’t it?” I said referring to a rumor that had gone around about her, and instantly regretting it. Everything had been going so good I thought she would be down with it. And with all the flirting I had done all year, and her too, I was hurt at her response.

“You really are just another asshole huh? And I know you’re on something what do you think I’m stupid? You think its normal to rub your face every thirty seconds and scratch your back, and close your eyes. Go to hell. I put up with it because you’ve been nice all year, but trust me Steve, you weren’t nice today and you weren’t  attractive either.”

Now normally this dude always sells chunks of tan. He tells me his normal connect got busted and he had to go to someone new. I ask if its good and he hesitantly says ""yeah its decent."" He knows i dont shoot so he says it gives a good rush when you shoot it and is cometely clear with water on it. Then he goes on to tell me how hes getting kicked out of his apartment and needs a new place asap. All this shit is making me think this shit is gonna be stepped on garbage because he lost his connect and needs money to get a new place. I finally get to where i can do some. I open the bag and it doesnt really have much of a smell either. I dump out a good portion(maybe about 1 and a half times what i normally do) and sniff it up. 3 minutes later im on my way back to work cause i was on my lunch break and this shit hits me hard. I walk back in to work and am way too fucked up, like im almost nodding just standing up. Luckil after like 45 min i was better(still pretty high though.) Anyway, sorry for the wall of text.

I'm totally new here, and am looking around for some form of opiate that I can buy in the USA (I am in TX) that is legal.  It also needs to be safe because I know close to nothing about this stuff and have a family.  

I have zero tolerance for opiates, so even if it is weak that is fine.  The thing is, I can't really drink alcohol because of health/stomach issues, but want to enjoy a buzz from time to time.  I have always liked vicodin, and even taking some tylenol-3 has been nice.  But I very very rarely ever see these; it is basically just if I am prescribed it for some reason (happened a couple times), or if my wife is (also hardly ever).  

Any ideas here?  Obviously, I know nothing about this stuff.  

And yeah, I'm not going to go the illegal route, just because I don't want it THAT bad, and I have a family and stuff like that.  

Do I have options here, or what?  Or is there some form of pseudo-opiate that is legal?",1389987849.0

So on Monday as my shift was ending, my boss comes up to me n says we need to talk.  She leads me to a conference room, I'm kinda panic'n at this point cuz another supervisor has joined us.....no bueno. 

They tell me someone in the office thinks I'm ""under the influence"" of something. I was told to clock out, and there was a cab waiting for me downstairs to take me to be drug/alcohol tested immediately. And I am not able to come back to work until the results come back, if I passed then I would be paid for the time off, if I failed I would be fired. 

I had been smokin' fent all day, actually had some of a patch still in my pocket. Full blown PANIC-MODE. 

Now I have heard that fent doesn't show on drug tests unless they r specifically looking for it.....upon researching on my phone on the way to the test I found mixed info on the subject. And this was definitely the only thing in my system at all. 

Cut to Wednesday, I was told to follow up mid day if I hadn't heard from anyone yet. So I called my boss, she sd she hadn't heard anything yet.....I contact the testing facility, they sd the results were returned Tuesday, the same day they received the sample. 

So now I'm startin to freak out....my boss calls me around 3pm, ""as u know, the results came back and u were clean....can u come back in Friday?""
(I already had Thursday scheduled off...)

So, it's true....fent doesn't show up on a drug test, my sample went str8 to a lab too....not on-site. I don't know what kinda test they did, but I passed!  It really is the ninja opiate, no smell when it's being smoked and apparently not detected on drug tests. Two good reasons it's my DOC, and I fukn love the high it gives....I don't know what people r talkin' bout when they say there's no euphoria, cuz it gives me more than most diesel, and I say most cuz I've gotten some fire that was hands n feet above the rest.

Would it be plausible for me to contact this doctor and have him refill the prescription? For instance, a situation could arise where the pain I endured was temporarily subsided due to the trauma of the fall which prevented the need for pain medication during the previous months and it abruptly reappears leaving myself in agonizing pain, for which the pain medication  would be the perfect remedy. These would be used in the explicit instructions advised in order to relieve the sudden suffering I would experience.

Wish my friends (who i have good karma with.. as in.. always hook them up with shit, like burned dvd's n fronts)   Just hoping someone will repay me some.

Got a handfull of vikes to get my ass motivated so i can get some serious computer work done.   Small rural PA town computer ""tech support"" business is always feast or famine when it comes to work n job opportunities.   So.. i pounce on this.

My buddy hooked me up with 5 x 10mg valium last night.  So.. I got a great night sleep while kicking some minor wd's.   After giving up the IV, WD's haven't been nearly as bad.  10 x 2mg immodiums gets me thru a couple slow days.

I'm moving to florida in a week or two, for the next 3 months, while it's tourist season there..  all the snowbirds have migrated.  Gonna go serve some food in The Villages and do some on-call tech support stuff.   I always end up being that ""helpful guy"" dealing with people's computer issues..  moreso setup & training.  But.. I always feel guilty overcharging for BS like that geeksquad racket.   Also.. it kills my anxiety sometimes.   I need health insurance again.. get my script of valium back, and something for my shitty knees.  I'd be so happy with my own tramadol, cuz that's all i need to feel ""fine"" and not be hobbling around.

After my younger son's mom passed away Nov 2012.. my life has been in a shitty rut.   I'm bored in life..  need something new..  need to get my pilot's license again (medical expired).  I'm dreaming of being a banner tow pilot.. fly over beaches with a banner, and rack up some PIC flight hours.  I dunno what it pays.. but.. it's a paying job doing something I love.. and feeds my ""high"" in a non-drug way.  Doing things that make me happy.. make me confident.. make me ""myself"".

Dealing with this BPD has been a shitty trip..  cuz.. i don't know who i am. and living in my hometown, I'm just in a shitty place.. but seeing my kids everyday is great.  My exwife married a guy with 6 kids..  so she ignores our kids in favor of the best for his kids.. she's a professional bs'er mother.  Acts so great, so pretentious.. it's her drama hell, and i'm suffering the side effects.

My kids know that I always do the best I can for them.. and come thru when they need anything.  It's just hard when their mother gives away all their stuff to these lil scummer/neglected kids.   As in.. she won't let kids in her bedroom.  Meanwhile.. I've had 3-4 kids piled up in my kingsize waterbed, while i sleep on the couch.

I feel like I'm just a big brother to them sometimes.   As in.. living at my dad's house (while he's in florida all winter)  and my mom cares TOO MUCH.  she's got anxiety issues.. and i can't deal with her.  she worries, complains, etc.. and i'm very confrontational.  like..  you gonna complain? let's do something about it!!  if not.. then just CHILL. LET IT BE.   But.. she's on her anti-depressants/welbutrin.   Yesterday I told her to ""either chill out, or share your meds with me..""    Wrestling tournaments are stressful for her.. cuz kids just run wild all day at a HS gym.   I usually pile up blankets and nap.  Tell the kids ""ill be right here if you need something..""  and let them go.

Anyways...  That's my birthday ""life at 31"" rant.  Just gettin things off my chest, cuz then I feel better.

I met up with a couple redditors over the summer.. and they were 20-ish, while I'm 30-ish.  They thought I was an awesome dad.   We got high and went looking for Adventure Time t-shirts. (back to school shopping)   It was epic cool.   Good people..   dude's now rehabbed.. cuz he spiraled down hard.  And i'm proud he's got control of his life again.

Anyways...  I'm a Capricorn!  a mermaid goat.  :)   but.. close enough to aquarious too, so i consider both of those signs my horoscope.

I need to start dating again.  I'm over mourning.. I need someone new.. someone to inspire me to be better for myself.  Gotta get away from being boring old ME.  Gotta find someone to shine in their eyes.  But yet. after the exwife and deceased BFF GF.. i've got higher standards and low tolerance for female bullshit.  Don't want no pretentious girl.  Just a truly loving, passionate, person to share my life with..   as my life is passing me by alone.

So me and a few friends usually return things and sell the gift card to make our dope cash,and today we made about 250 bucks. the car was full and the driver had to take his mom to work,and because for some reason im the hated scapegoat in our group,I had to be dropped off.""dude we'll be right back we wont ripp you off"" yeah that was 3 hours ago.the whole time they string me along with texts saying that theyre dropping her off,the machine wouldnt take this card so they had to pick this person up etc.  

So they finally said they were leaving the last person they had to drop offs house and told me to be outside in 20 minutes and they would drop off my cut.45 goes by.im standing in the freezing cold with 2 healing shattered legs.  

Little backstory on that,in june i was hit by a drunk driver while i was walking and had both legs shattered from the knee down along with my left arm,also had a severe concussion and a ruptured spleen. so its still extremely hard to get around.  

the driver is a douchenozzle and ahalf for no apparent reason,and he lives >A BLOCK AWAY FROM ME.when they finally hit me back up my other buddy that was with them said that i would have to walk up to his house to get it because the other guy wanted to just keep my share because he didnt feel like taking the time to stop by my house even though its very much on the way(Other guys house is 7 miles from me)  

This is so fucked.its terrible.I treat all of my friends like gold and have my entire life because without people to hang out with my life feels pretty meaningless.these guys came to see me in the hospital and saw firsthand the severity of how fucked up i was,and theyre saying that i have to walk 14 miles just to get a 40 bag.  

I feel like i should mention that the entire reason their journey was even possible was because i walked to drivers house with my last 9 bucks so had enough gas to make it to the mall and the card machine and the dboys.  

I wouldn't even associate myself with them if i knew literally anybody else that had a connect,but theyre my only one. Northwest PA sucks fucking donkey dick,almost as much as they do as friends...

A couple months back I finally found a reliable hookup for roxy 30s. Before then i almost exclusively took norco 10/325s. I've been taking anywhere from 60-90mgs of roxy a day. I take 30mg to get me where i want to be then I take 15mg at a time periodically to stay there. Now when the roxy guy is out and I have to get norcos I have to take at least 70mgs at once to feel anything and even then the high isn't anywhere near what I use to get off of 30mgs of hydrocodone before I started with the roxies. I know that roxies are stronger but I didn't think they were THAT much stronger? Does anyone have a similar experience? Is this normal?

tl;dr: switched from hydrocodone to roxy, now when I take hydrocodone I feel barely any effects even when I take 3x my normal dose. What gives?",1390081182.0

Alot of you here know alot about me, and what's been going on with me, my addiction, and my life in general. That's just the kind of community this is; full of good people. 

As I type this, 18 days sober.. Yes I caved and texted the dope girl... But I haven't done anything yet... 

In reference to my post a month or so back, about whether I should leave my current boyfriend to try to get clean again with my ex boyfriend who became a junkie with me. Long story short, I finally (wo)manned up and ended it with my boyfriend. It wasn't fair to him. Now, prepare for the shocker, I'm not with my ex boyfriend currently either. I'm single. I really took alot of the advice I was given to heart, and I realized I needed some time on my own to figure out who I really am. Im scared shit less, but I know I can make it alone. I need no man to support me. 

So, today is the day I gather all my things from my newest ex boyfriends house. I finally started to feel feelings last night; it was God awful. I knew how long the process would be. I knew my old flame would expect me to be his again now that my breakup is official. And really, I just want to find out. Whose the real Haley? Without a boyfriend? Without someone influencing my life? When it's only me?

Well for starters, the real Haley is a heroin addict. And a benzo addict, probably, on top of that. And the real Haley is tired of dealing with the feelings, the arguments, the fights, the troubles, and everything else that inevitably comes with life. The real Haley is just a lost, lonely shell of the girl she used to be. 

In short, this Haley that I am now, the only one I know anymore, may get off the sober bus soon and go ghost for a bit. Stay safe yall. ",1390075877.0

An empty google document. The white cloud dissipates and I instinctively reach for the bowl and light it. Inhale. Hold it. Exhale.

And I've only written 2 whole sentences so far. 

Why is it so hard to get my thoughts out of my own head when they are swimming around in there, constantly bumping into each other and bouncing off of the inside walls of my skull. You would think they would just begin to ooze out of my orifices. Giving my thoughts a chance to occupy my fingers for a  moment, to take control.. it should be more easy. But instead I instinctively grab for the bowl again. Light. Inhale. Hold it, a little longer this time...Exhale. 

The bowl is empty now. I refill it because I don’t want to be distracted by the task next time I decide to distract myself from the task. Hello my name is <insert female name here>, or <insert male name here>. I don’t really know or care. And I am a drug addict. I said it. There. 

I’m really surprised at how fast this stuff can make you feel like shit. Suck you in.. take you for a ride… and leave you hanging at the top of the ferris wheel. Everything looks so beautiful up there. All the lights. You can see the whole carnival and the people below look so small, like ants, so disconnected from your reality. You are above it all. You feel amazing. Until you realize the ride isn't going to start moving anytime soon. You don’t have any water up there. The wind blows and you’re cold. You’re all alone. Carnie ride operator, Mr. Good Dope Dealer, is nowhere to be found. You scream to the little ants below you on the ground but they cannot hear you. You suddenly wish you hadn't chosen to disconnect yourself from them. But you made the choice to take the ride. You made the choice to get high. 

Because who wouldn't invest in love in a bag that costs $10. I am a drug addict. But above all I am a love addict. 

I can’t truly say I regret it. But that’s probably because I am high right now. They say you shouldn't make decisions when you are upset or angry, and that you shouldn't make promises when you are happy. I nodded out and forgot what I was going to say about that, but it seems important to keep in here. 

I guess maybe what I wanted to say is that it’s useless to write about how you’re going to stop getting high while you’re high.  Because I’m still on the ferris wheel and it hasn't stopped moving yet. So I’m not going to write about that. And I’m not going to make any promises right now. And If i do they will probably be a lie. Because being an addict means that I make decisions when I am upset and I make promises when I am happy. And that’s just  poor. But of course…

Light. Inhale, Hold it. Exhale. I’m not sure how long I just nodded off there.. but damn that was blissful.

I can’t stop smoking. Compulsively. And I would keep blowing line after line until all my dope is gone if it didn't mean I would have to be sick in front of my family tomorrow. I've spent the past 5 hours snorting lines and smoking, nodding out. Rinse; repeat. Rinse; repeat. I’m all washed out. But there’s still shampoo left in the bottle and I know how to get it out. 

Light. Inhale. Hold, but barely this time. Exhale. You don’t even know how to smoke properly, and I love that about you. I don’t even smoke pot when I’m with you.  And I can’t remember the last time in my life that I didn't even want some bud. 

I’m not even a drug addict. I’m just addicted to your love. ",1390072083.0

Until I clicked this thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1vfs9t/scheming_hard/

This guy is saying he wants to screw over someone who wants to buy from him online, and has been operating his instagram for over a year JUST TO SCREW PEOPLE OVER.  And then he asks if it's okay to screw someone over for $2Gs if they fall for his trap. 

And then, to my surprise, most people say go ahead, and I was disappointed.  Really? Is this how you people think? I know that when people use and are finding they tend to not give much of a fuck about morality, but this guy rationally says he wants to screw people over and people are rationally telling him that it's okay to do that.  

What the fuck people? How is it ever okay to just rip someone off because you don't know them?

Give it a try if you're interested in getting off this shit. Or don't. I'm not trying to be preachy, just reaching out with my own experience.","I got on Suboxone, stopped, got back on dope, got back on Suboxone, fooled around with getting high and using Subs as a safety net for a bit, then ran out of my savings (unemployed now), and it's been since ~September 20th since I got high.

Right now, it's just not a part of my life anymore, other than taking the subs.

I got lucky in that I could live home for so long for free without working/having money.  It's really helped me forget about opiates and the lifestyle.  There was a time when I'd come on this subreddit and it would all come back... but now, it's just like a distant memory.  And I really don't think it's the subs killing my cravings (at least not entirely).

I dunno how I'll do when I get off Suboxone, but I guess we'll see.  Honestly I don't want to get off the subs, since they're a Happy pill for me.  It's an opioid after all, and it cures my depression fairly well.  Been on 2mg for months now, and I look forward to popping that 1/4th of a pill every morning.  It's a slow onset, but I go from feeling ""bleh"" to inspired (and hungry!) in 45 minutes.  It's its own type of rush, in that it makes me feel normal.

But yeah, if you can, I recommend getting on subs and moving away from the lifestyle of scoring.  Take the subs as recommended and spend time figuring out what you want to do.  

Don't be discouraged if it's boring at first.  It's a process that will take time.  

Personally I took to drinking here and there when I felt like I needed to feel something *more*.  But a few hangovers stopped that shit right and quick.  I still drink, but I don't think I've gotten drunk in a few weeks now.  Haven't smoked weed since New Years, and it was a good month and some change before *that*.  Still smoking cigs... gotta get rid of that soon, but til then, it could be worse.

I hope this doesn't bum you guys out.  I know what it's like to come on here and not have to worry about some dude saying, ""Get clean, you junky!""  Honestly this isn't about that.  Everyone gets clean at their own pace (some never do).  

Just be safe until then, and try to treat others with respect (e.g. don't rob people... especially not the handicapped!  I'm looking at *you* heroinking!)

When she was released she had this ""spiritual awakening"" which has included practicing in activities such as crystal healing and tarot card reading. She has also been writing down a lot of random gibberish such as number plate details and random lyrics of songs. Her thoughts do not at all sound logical. She has also been thinking that she has the power to ""fix"" the world and ""heal"" the people around her.

Even if I binge a few shots a day for two weeks and have a break before the next binge, im still thinking about how I wish I had heroin during my break...and maybe thats really no different to actually being addicted to the substance.

I guess the whole psychological vs physical thing comes into play, like I told myself when I tried IV'ing for the first time last year that I'd never let myself get physically addicted, which I haven't to date(I dont really count having the sniffles/restless legs after my last binge to count because it was so mild) but now I feel more like maybe I am somewhat mentally addicted but just not physically.

Some time today = Probably tomorrow

In about an hour = Generally, about 2 - 3 hours from now

one sec = five to ten minutes maybe

I'm right down the road = I'm just now leaving

I'm here = I'll be there in 2-3 minutes

Ill call you = Im not going to call you, in fact, Im not going to answer when you call ME.

My cousin = some dude I met 20 mins ago.

Meet half way = I'll lie about where I'm at so that I don't have to go that far.

and this has nothing to do with time, but does anybody else have that dealer that will answer his phone, say ""whats good"" or what not, and then continue his conversation with whoever he's with at the time for about 30 seconds and then finally say whats up again. That shit drives me nuts lol.

Idk if I just fuck with the shittiest dealers who hate to make money or what. and yes, I do realize that I am on their time as they have what I want, but you think they would want to make their custo's happy so they keep coming back. Actually, who am I kidding... Im coming back regardless. And I am in no way bitching about any of this. I just think its funny how much they are all alike.

A laptop case
A medium sized bag filled with shoes.  Vans ect.*

That said, I was wondering about this through the day (I hope this isn't a common question!)

So I have a friend that is deep in the throes of heroin addiciton--been to rehab twice since August, I could go on and on...anyway, I mentioned I had some Vicodin (7.5/750 hydrocodone/acetaminophen) and she actually *wanted* some.  Which is fine given the Percocet she flipped my way (to accompany Adderall, love me a speedball), but I asked why she wanted a weaker opiate.

She said that she took two (Percocet or Percodan, I forget which) and she immediately became ill and vomited violently, to the point where she almost went to the ER.  She mentioned this being a problem lately, which I found odd.

Can the side effects of different opiates truly vary this widely?  Were other factors at play, such as reduced tolerance (she recently got out of a rehab stint and within days of her release was using) or her liver not metabolizing something?  She has Hepatitis C, also...if that royally fucks with things.  Thank god this is a throwaway account.

I'll start by saying I have been clean before, albeit a few weeks at a time. Generally I quit and go through the hell when I am broke or script is out. That brings me to now.

I started on Percs and Morphine initially for bad arthritis and joints swellings. Was given 10x325 4 times a day by family doc until he referred me to pain management. There i was upped to 10x325 6 times a day and 15mg morphine tablet at bed time so I could sleep. Since then I moved and was transferred to another pain management place who cut me down to 10x325 3 times a day and a 5mg Oxymorphone at bed time. I have been on this for about 3-4 years. My last ""detox"" was about a month ago and lasted for almost 2 weeks.

I have been through cold turkey before and I have also been through them with the help of  some anxiety meds, tramadol, and Gabapentin. As i'm sure you are aware, that's not really a good way to get off of them as the Tramadols are almost just as bad for an addict. My issue now is all I will have is Gabapentin and I am actually somewhat fine with that. Meaning if I am gonna detox, I want to detox completely without relying on some other form of pain med to help get me through it.

I have checked into going on a Suboxone program but the cost was absurd and not covered by my insurance. It was like $300 for the first visit and $200 each visit after that. So I am stuck going cold turkey as I am strapped for cash for the next 2 weeks and thus no access to Percs or a way to pay for a doctor visit to get some sort of meds to help with the withdrawls. 

Can anyone recommend anything to help be done for good? Or am I basically SOL without a way to pay for a doctor visit and subsequent script? I can handle most of it in the past except for the being EXTREMELY tired and not being able to sleep. Adding to the issue is I can't afford to take time off of work, but I do work from home so I can ""Hide"" going through everything. The Gabapentin helps with a lot of the symptoms but it makes me groggy at times. Is this the only and best way to be done?

But on heroin it is. Heroin. Not even once….

And you’re the type of person who’s willing to try anything more than once. You wrote that on your online dating website profile. You thought it would make you sound cute and open to new things. But in reality you have come to find that your life is closing in on itself. Layer by layer, your life reducing to repeated habits collapsing in upon you. Layer by layer. And the lies build you up from the outside in. The lies you tell yourself. The lies you tell the girl. The lies you tell to your family and friends. The lies you will tell your next OK Cupid date.

Your everyday life begins to play out in a similar fashion to bad episode of intervention. 

And the very same things you used to watch on television for amusement become mundane details of your everyday life. You become disillusioned to the fact that normal people don’t sniff a bag of heroin on the way to Christmas dinner. Or before work. Or after work. Or before or after just about everything. Layer by layer. You start to come up with all different excuses to get high.’I just need to get through this week,” “I have work today, ""I don’t have work today,""“I had a bad day,"" ""I had a good day"". But really the only excuse is that you like to get high, and that’s not even an excuse at all.

And then you get to the point when you are just about out of excuses. You’re tired of the hassle and you miss having money and time to spend with your friends on the weekends. You actually miss that hangover you used to get from drinking one too many beers at the pub in good company. You wake up one day and you say “today I won’t get high.” You spend the entire morning and afternoon elated. You actually feel happy.You haven’t been sober in so long that you forgot what sober feels like. And it actually feels like a drug in its own right. You make it to 24 hours and you are still buzzed on life itself. You hangout with your girlfriend for a while. As you stroke and kiss her smooth soft skin you are surprised at how vivid and real it feels. You have been numbing yourself for so long, living in this fog of reduced sensation to everything. And you are happy you decided to stop today. 

And then you lay down to go to sleep, holding her close. And that feeling in your legs kicks in. You feel like you can’t keep them still. You can’t make yourself comfortable in any way. You kick and toss and turn and you’re so restless. Your mind races and you begin to panic. 

And it is at that moment, when all other excuses have been exhausted, that you experience the ultimate excuse.  The one that you have heard about from countless junkies on countless tv shows, movies,  books but had yet to experience yourself. In your clouded state, you actually believed that you were invincible to it. The sickness. And then you beg for her to lend you a bag so that you can get to sleep tonight, because you have work in the morning. And she agrees, so that she can get to sleep tonight, because she has work in  the morning. You sniff that bag and the panic and tension melts away like magic. You fade away into sleep. And then you don’t try to do that whole “quitting” thing again for a while.  

And here you are today. You’re down to your last bag and it doesn’t even belong to you. You owe it to her because you asked her to lend you a bag last night when you weren’t as fucked up as you wanted to be. But it’s snowing outside and you won’t see her today. And as the snow falls and builds up around you, layer by layer, the possibility of you being able to drive to Brooklyn to buy more diminishes. Layer by layer.You think to yourself “I shouldn’t have made a promise when I was high,” as you do that last bag. And the clock resets...

My pain manager is starting the transition from oxy to fentanyl for me. I was taking 75 mg a day but it looks like i'm in this for the long haul, so he wanted me to try an ER medication and since I am really crappy about keeping count of my pills and remembering if I took them, he wanted me to use duragesic patches. I am on 25 mcg/hr, which I put on Monday afternoon. By evening I was not having much pain but still some but I was craving oxy like crazy. Today was even worse, where my pain was half taken care of compared to oxy, so i would take an oxy for breakthrough but even with the pain taken care of i'm still craving more. Is this normal? Does it just take longer for the patch to get to the level I need in my system to manage my pain and will these oxy cravings subside at some point? 

I put waterproof tape on top of the patch to keep it on, is it possible that this is affecting transdermal absorption? I didn't want it to fall off so I put a few layers of tape on top and when i tried to change the tape the patch went off with the tape and no longer is adhesive to my skin, so I had to retape it on. did I fuck this up?

When I came across Pethidine (Demerol). I noticed on Wikipedia ""Adverse Effects"" it said, Unlike other opioids, it does not cause miosis (Pinned Pupils). Then to ease withdrawl some people said take Loperamide (Imodium AD). Which is an **over the counter** opioid that doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, binding instead to the opioid receptors in the large intestine. So here we have an opioid that produces essentially only one effect, constipation.


That is a very interesting fact. It makes me wonder, have we discovered/synthesized every form of opiate possible? Maybe a safe Opiate that creates an incredible euphoria yet doesn't cause respiratory depression (Overdose) and maybe even stops opiate receptor downregulation (Tolerance/Homeostasis) There are so many different opioid receptors in the brain and body. We're only starting to understand how they work. 


Could a perfect opioid be made and prescribed to addicts? As much as they want for as long as they want? I go to NA meetings and it's a very sad life. You spend all your life wanting something and fighting the urge to have it. And being an addict is the worst thing you could be in this world. The world doesn't have time to care or give a shit. Abstinence based programs are making a killing. Drug courts are a BOOMIN'. Got people flocking in and out of the system like sheep. Why can't we adopt a harm reduction approach in America and introduce a new opioid to addicts that is scientifically engineered to be superior to any other? Reducing risk of overdose and stopping addiction. Engineered to detox people off of heroin and allow the brain to start producing it's natural amount of bio chemistry again. An opioid where the dose is LOWERED instead of raised over the first few weeks as the brain returns to opiate naive levels causing the effects of this ""super cure"" to get stronger.


I like to stay well informed, and I know that the drug war is a huge farce. I know that the CIA is bringing in the dope from Afghanistan to fund their black ops and whatever else [they're doing.!](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_CIA_drug_trafficking) And having a legal opiate that is safe would totally kill the black market/supply and demand. I believe in a harm reduction approach. Like the one being adopted by [other countries in Europe.!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMMFWPl6ue4)


Don't tell me the best thing we have is Methadone (developed in 1937!) and Buprenorphine (partial agonist :()... Why is it ok to trade one addiction for another when one doesn't make you feel as good. We can do better. There's so much we still don't understand about these drugs and how they work in the brain. I really believe that through science, chemistry, and discovery. Addicts like us can ""have our cake and eat it too."" Do you have any idea the implications of such a discovery would have for people like us? Millions of people would be free from a horrible and debilitating life of pain and misery. SUBOXONE... This can't be the best we can do. This isn't over. Just because we have alternatives doesn't mean this problem is fixed. Let's just put people into treatment and when they're clean they're happy. It doesn't work that way. And I don't believe in putting people behind bars for victimless crimes. What if the cure for my depression IS OPIOIDS? What if it's exactly what I need to be ""happy"".

**What would your perfect opiate be? Here's mine:**

* Constricted (small) pupils
* Warm Flushing Skin
* Sleepiness / Nodding

* NO Respiratory depression
* NO Constipation
* NO Nausea
* NO Dry mouth
* NO TOLERANCE (Opiate Receptor Downregulation)

The break happened about 15 years ago, and I have developed osteoarthritis and it's only going to get worse. I've run out of other options so I am considering starting a therapeutic dose (let me stress this, I'm not looking to get high) of some kind of narcotic. I have been on Vicodin for a few weeks at a time here and there. When I would stop the meds ifs go through a few days of crankiness and a little diarhhea but nothing heavy.

The pain clinic I have been too have me a cream to try. That was a joke. They are very reluctant to put me on pain meds because 40 is still young and obviously they understandably don't want to create an addict, but I am at the end of my rope here. I do smoke weed at night for relaxation and they are saying that is contradictory to pain med treatment. I understand their points of view but I feel like I'm pulling teeth and begging for help that these docs really don't want to give.

My questions: I'm assuming they're going to drug test me but it's gonna take 30 days to test clean for that. So are they just going to leave me twisting in the wind until then?

Are all pain clinics this tight fisted? 

Also out of curiosity, what are their procedures for monitoring usage?

I will take any and all advice into consideration, I thank you.",1390351242.0

Toward the part of your elbow that faces away from you, there's two veins that come together to form a Y, and right near the base of that Y seems like the best spot to hit. It bulges a little bit if I take a hot shower, then put a tourniquet on while squeezing my fist.


Watched my MM shoot, so I know what the procedure is like; about 40 units of water, put the tourniquet on, go in at a shallow angle, pull back a little bit when you break the skin to create a vacuum, then when you hit the vein the blood will bloom in the rig. Then you release the tourniquet, pull back a little to make sure you're in, shoot 20ccs or so, pull back again to make sure you're still in, then shoot the rest. I have one of those fancy adjustable tourniquets with the buckle and quick release button, so that's nice.

I've practiced a few grips, and the one I like is holding the rig by curling my pinky, ring, and index finger around the barrel, and using the thumb and pointer to work the plunger. That seems to keep it nice and steady, is that the proper way to hold it?

So, I'm responding to my first run of the morning, picking up a patient in a wheelchair van bound for the dialysis center, and as I'm parking, I see a competing companies ambulance begin to pull up running emergent, so I shrugged it off, basically thinking these guys were just being fuckin dumbasses, so a few seconds later i see the fire engine arrive, and that's when I knew something was up. So as I walk inside to get my patient, I hold the door open for the ambulance crew to get the cot through, and they take off down the hall to my right, while I turn and go down the left hand hallway, well when I get to the nurses station, and ask em what's up, they said that they had an unresponsive resident, sitting in her wheelchair. So, I assumed she probably just had low blood pressure and fell out. Come to find out later on in the day when I returned, she had actually died of respiratory depression, due to an overdose in opiates.. She was on some sort of liquid pain med(oxyfast,oramorph,etc.) and the trained nurse fuckin killed her.. This pissed me off beyond belief.. First of all, many of the staff are not pleasant people to begin with, they're short with patients, or just plain ignore basic questions, or requests for assistance from these poor people who are completely and almost totally dependent on them..  Now they can't even dose medications? Come on.. My nursing home stories are far from over, but I doubt I'll post them in the opiates forum due to the fact that most aren't opiate related..

My best friend has been on Oxy 30's for around 10 years now, she has always had the same doctor and when ever the doctor did ask for pee the 30's would always show up. On occasion other things would show, like most recently 2 months ago she tested positive for amphetamines. The doctor said to her if you wanted an amphetamine you should've just asked and wrote her a script for Ritalin. He's actually a really cool doctor. Or was...They had a great relationship, she never lied to him & the Doctor trusted her. 

On Christmas Eve, she was at the store to buy Lope because she ran out of her script a week early( & I told her what I learned from you guys!), & guess who was at the same store?! Her Doctor. He noticed her pain, called her out on it & he said to meet him at his office in an hour. He asked for pee, she gave it to him and he wrote the script. Just in time before the pharmacies all closed until 12/26. 
This month, she called last Friday at 8:00am, the Doctor called back at 5:00pm yelling saying he wasn't going to give her the script early & yelled some crap about the DEA coming down hard now. So, today was her refill day, so she called at 9:30am & was told the Doc would be contacting her back. Seemed normal enough.
The Doc called back around noon (which was weird because in the 10 years she's been a patient, they ALWAYS called right before closing).The doctor said that her drug test had NO Oxy on it. & my friend tells him ""You saw me that day, you wrote it early for me because I was withdrawing from it. I told you I ran out early & explained the situation"". The doctor then accuses her of selling her pills, (IF she's broke & has NO other ways to get money, she'll sell a few, not many because she actually needs them. But, since she was 17 she's been on some form of Oxy for pain. She literally cannot walk or even sit up without some kind of pain med.) they go back and forth and the doctor says she is cut off & then hangs up on her. My friend called & spoke to the doctor two more times, & the doctor threatened to call the police if she called again & hung up on her...
So, my questions for you guys would be:
1. Can the doctor actually do this?!  Like legally. Just cut her off after it not showing up ONCE AND he knew she ran out early that month, he knew.
2. She's broke right now & is starting to withdraw. Is her best option to go into an ER? She's got films to prove that her back is FUCKED UP & parts have been removed.
3. I am going to be calling doctors/pain management clinics for her tomorrow (also her doctors office to request all of her medical records), should I seek a regular doctors office or a pain management? She lives in the Tri-State area, she goes from NJ to PA a lot & she doesn't have medical insurance if that info helps anyone to answer.
Any info would be GREATLY appreciated guys, I myself have been clean & sober for about the year, but I still come on this sub a few times a day to read all about what everyone has been up to. If you need anymore personal info, feel free to PM me, I've known her since we were 2, she is basically my sister so I know everything. Thanks Everyone!

I use because I hate myself. I hate the way I look and I hate who I am, I hate all the mistakes I've made and the regrets I have, I hate that I have no friends and I can't interact with people or socialize normally. Using makes me feel good. It makes me forget about all of my self hatred and sadness and while I'm high I actually feel like a normal person, and not a depressive mess. It makes me feel happy, and it makes me forget about everything that usually makes me scared, sad, or anxious.



When I'm high, I'm the person that I want to be. I'm happy, socialable, outgoing and fun to be around. Most of all, I'm comfortable with myself.

After I copped, I parked somewhere off the map, split it into two seperate shots and proceded to boot up. After that, I had an hour drive. As you could have probably guessed I started to nod off 5 or 10 minuted into the trip (I'm guessing) and I swerved to the left and just barely rubbed a concrete barrier and destroyed my driver side mirror. I would just like to apologize to the /r/opiates community as well as the rest of the drivers on the road for putting your lives at risk. I am well aware of how stupid that was so please don't message me saying how stupid it was. I put this on here not looking for sympathy, or karma, or whatever, but in hopes that you will learn from my stupid mistake being totally irresponsible and succoming to the opiate addict stereotype. The roads are already dangerous enough, we don't need half awake people driving on the highways. Again, I just want to apologize for being a complete dumbass and say that I will never do that much and drive again. I don't see anything wrong with having a little buzz and driving, but please do not over do it like I did today. I wish you all the best and hope that this post will give you somewhat of a reality check in just how dangerous it can be. I mean, what if that barrier wasn't there? Its scary as shit knowing that I could have taken somebodys life today, as well as my own. Like when I think about it, I just picture that being my little sister in the car I may have hit and it just enrages me. I'm really upset with myself because of this but in conclusion, I can honestly say that I will never dose and drive again. It can wait. Happy Nods to you all and please, please, please be safe guys. Have a great night.

You guys are my favorite so i figured you might give me a lil boost that i need.

  Basically what it boils down to is i have to get a root canal. You may have seen my post from earlier this week. I dont have dental insurance so its going to run me about 1,000 bucks. And thats the ""friendly"" price from a dentist that my family goes to. On top of that my mother thought it would be a grea idea to suprise me with a new car. Which i was super excited about, even though the car i had still worked just fine. Granted the car i was driving was kind of a beater with 250,000 miles on it, but the car was very much still functional. Anywho in all my excitement about my new car my mom pulls me aside and tells me that she will be expecting the 8 grand back that she paid for it. Well fuck me. There is never such thing as a gift in my family so i kind of saw it comming.
  Im just in a shitty place right now. Basically im 8gs in the hole because my mom thought it would be cool if i had a new car but only fronted me the money on it. I dont want to sound like a spoiled bitch or anything because i appreciate the new ride, but i wasnt prepared to pay 8gs. So now im in the hole for 9,000 fucking dollars and rent and bills are comming up which atleast another 500 bucks. Oh and not to mention that i am only a server at a restraunt and have a fucking drug problem. Im so stressed the fuck out right now its not even funny. Atleast my dude hit me up and said he has the 10mg percs in tow right now. So im fitting to get high as fuck today and try to forget about how fuck over i am right now.
  Sorry for the rant guys but i dont really have anyone else to talk to. Does anyone have a similar experience? Am i justified in being pissed that someone else commited me to a 8,000 dollar investment that wasnt planned for? Am i just being a whiney bitch? Give me some feedback please.

My history is basically that many years ago I was using dope and oxy's and I ended up on methadone, which changed my life for the better. I was on it for 7 years, and slowly weaned myself off. 

So basically I was totally clean for about a year, and stupidly decided it would be fine to pop a few Percocets... eventually, of course, I was back to buying hydromorphone, and doing ~24mg a day, depending on what I could afford.

I really wanted to get past withdrawals and avoid going back on methadone. I was doing fine before I fucked myself over, not suffering from intense cravings or anything, I just fell victim to my own hubris, thinking I could handle some Percs without getting out of control. Methadone is a realy hassle, especially when the program starts out. I'd have to go in everyday and wait in line for my drink, and come in twice a week to see a doctor and pee in a cup, and the fact that the clinic gets *tons* of business means each of those doctor visits take upwards of an hour. So I scheduled an appointment with my family doctor to see what kind of advice he could give me.

I hadn't seen this doctor in years, but my family has been with him for ages. He's fairly young (early 40's I think), and took over the practice from the doctor I had been going to since I was a baby. Anyways, he was very sympathetic, seems to be very knowledgeable about opiates in general, and certainly didn't show and condescension or suspicion. I had sent him an e-mail in advance explaining my situation, and I was very honest about my use and situation, so that likely helped as well.

Anyways, he recognized that I can go out and buy these drugs off the street, so he felt that I should first get stabilized before starting a slow taper... so I was prescribed two 12mg Hydromorph Contin capsules a day. This is *incredible* to me. I've been wasting my money, getting increasingly desperate, and paying $20 a pop for these 12mg caps, and the doctor just hands me a script. I'm going to stay at 24mg a day for one month, and then begin tapering.

In case you don't know, Hydromorph Contin is a common controlled release hydromorphone pill in Canada, and comes as gel caps filled with little beads. Unlike, say, Kadians, which are similar morphine pills, the beads are made up of cellulose, which doesn't gel up or melt from heat like wax. They're popular among IV users as they're fairly easy to prepare for injection, and with proper filtering there is minimal contamination from pill binders and the like. The 12mg ones are $20 standard on the streets here

Obviously if I were to start running out of pills early or anything, he would lose trust pretty fast and probably insist I head over the the methadone clinic again, but I certainly don't plan on doing that. I've been prescribed enough to be totally content. When we discussed things, he said that if I screw up with this taper, I should consider returning to methadone.

I'm going to stick to oral use, which due to the lower bioavailability of that route could mean some mild withdrawals at the start. The doctor did, however, prescribe clonidine as well, which is sometimes used to treat opiate withdrawals, so I can take that if necessary.

Anyways, I'm basically just flabbergasted that my doctor was so cool. I've tried a few times to go cold turkey over the past few months, but responsibilities always get in the way, and I end up using so I can get work done and function like a normal person. Now I don't need to worry about that. Clearly I should have done this a while ago, it would have saved me *a lot* of money. 

I don't know how many doctors would actually be this cool, I'm probably pretty lucky to have a doctor who doesn't seem to look down on, or judge people for addiction.  Has anyone else had experiences like this? It seems like there are a lot of people struggling to get their legit pain needs met, and I'm lucky enough to have a doctor willing to help me with my dependence issues.

**tl;dr: Went to the doctor, was totally honest and told him I was illicitly using 24mg of hydromorphone a day, walk out with a script for 24mg of hydromorphone a day. Has anyone else been lucky enough to have doctors this understanding and helpful?**",1390575613.0

I don't think these are available in the US, but they're 12mg Hydromorph Contins. 

They're pretty popular here in Canada as the beads inside are made of cellulose and not wax, meaning they're safer for preparing for injection. Dope is almost non-existent in my city, so these dominate the opiate market.

After a number of years on methadone, I got completely clean, but relapsed a few months ago, and got up to using, on average, 24mg a day of these things. I want to be able to get clean without going back on the 'done if I can avoid it, so I went to my longtime family doctor for help... and I got prescribed these to take twice a day, with plans to wean myself off them over a month or two.

IV'ing them is tempting, but I'm going to stick with using them as prescribed, as I want to actually get clean. Since oral hydromorphone has fairly low bioavailability, I expect to deal with a bit of withdrawal in the start. He also prescribed clonidine, which I've never tried for dealing with withdrawal before, but it's supposed to help a little bit, so I can use some of that if I feel the need.

The moral of the story? Sometimes honesty is the best policy. I straight up told my doctor I was abusing hydromorphone, and his response was to show me a great deal of sympathy, write me a script that allowed me to take exactly the amount I'd been using, and help me plan to work towards getting clean.

With my drug plan, I didn't have to pay a penny for them either. I had been spending $20 each for those little suckers. That's 28 20mg pills to last me 2 weeks, with a refill for another 2 weeks before I start tapering. That could have cost me $1120, and I got it all free... I just wish I was smart enough to get help weeks ago, I could have had a bit more cash laying around.",1390517280.0

Also, I know what a really bad abscess looks like, but what does it start as? could it come from the weird hard lump under my skin or bruising or red/swelling, if any of those 3 didn't go away after a while?

I posted this in another thread but thought it might be useful to post the info in its own thread.  Ive been seeing some pretty gnarly arms as a result of poor IV technique.  You'll really be kicking yourself in 4 years when your veins are all shot and you cant get off properly anymore! ;)

Granted, many problems result from impurities in street heroin and IV preparations made from pills- but having proper, sterile technique will go a LONG way to ensure you never end up as one of those poor bastards who sits in the hot bathtub with a spaceheater blasting on them for 3 hours to try and hit a vein-tears streaking down their face as they shriek curses of the day they ever picked up a needle. That shit's not necessary!  

Here it is:

Hematomas (bruising at injection site) can be easily avoided, and should be to preserve healthy veins and injection sites for future use.

Try to release the tourniquet after registering in the vein and before pushing medication in. Anchor the vein with your needle hand if possible by pulling the skin taught- this will increase likely-hood of inserting needle directly into vein, reducing the need to probe/fish.

Keep any and all probing and fishing to an absolute minimum-resist the temptation!

After medication has been pushed into the vein (toward heart), pull needle out and apply firm pressure directly to the site as the tip of the needle exits the skin. Keep pressure on for 1-2min.

Also, never keep a tourniquet on for more than a min or two. Try to get into the habbit of taking these extra steps, and always use a fresh needle- you should have nice veins and minimal bruising for many years to come!

1w2tbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1w2tbw/this_past_week_long/,19,https://redd.it/1w2tbw,BabbMrBabb,This past week.. [long],"So to start off.. I've been addicted now for a little over two years, or I guess dependent, as in I've used opiates every single day for 2 years. It started with 2-3 hydros a day and eventually progressed to where I am now, about 4-5 roxis a day. Not bad for some of you, but at $20-$25 a pop you can imagine how that would effect your wallet. 

So before this past week I had kind of been thinking about quitting, not really serious but more than usual. Then starting last Saturday my eyes began to open, and be be forced open to see what I've become. 

Starting with a friend of mine (we've always been cool) who owes me money and has been paying me back $100 at a time. We were at my buddies house and he says ""dude I'm leaning, my mom got a big bottle of hydromet and I've taken probably 30mg!"" And I'm kind of drunk and let it slip ""oh you're leaning? I've taken 3 perc 10's and 4 roxis today."" He looks at me like what the fuck man and is really quiet towards me the rest of the night. I wake up the next morning with a text saying ""You fucking dopehead and to think I was just giving you money to go spend it all on drugs. You fucked up, I'm not giving you shit else."" And we end up in an argument and I get called a dopehead, junkie, drug addict, all that like 40 times.  I start to reflect on myself. 

Same day I start telling my best friend about it and he pretty much agrees with the other dude but is way more supportive and ""friend like"" I guess you could say. He tells me that I really am starting to change and that I'm even looking sickly and that I need help. He says he'll be there for me the whole way, says that if I want to start going somewhere for professional help that I could even tell my family that I'm going for him so they wouldn't know about my problem, AND even tells me he'll quit Xanax (his doc, he's addicted to that) and that we can both get through out sickness together. There's a reason he's my best friend. Now I'm really thinking about quitting. 

The next thing that happened is a HUGE shocker and completely caught me off guard. I call my dealer and he's got a few roxis so I head over. He's an old guy probably about 60-65. I walk in and instead of the usual ""hey buddy what do you need? Or how many you want?"" He looks at me dead in the eyes and says, ""Look man, I'm not trying to make you mad or anything just asking a question. You're on these things bad aren't you? Well I know you are. You spend close to $100 a day on these things and I've already ended up with your shotgun when you were out of money and that just ain't right. Now look, I gotta few people that can get some suboxone and I'll get those for you instead of these roxis if you wanna try and quit. I'm not making you do this, I'm just asking. I'm not gonna quit selling to you or anything. This is all up to you, but I just hate to sit here and watch a young boy like you get sucked into this shit. ""

THAT my friends is a good dealer. So after what had happened the day before I'm all in. I tell him I would love to do that. Then right then and there he calls up like 6 people and tells them ""he's got a friend who's getting into these roxis bad that he wants to help"" and in about 10 min a younger guy about 30 who lives next door shows up and takes me to this guys house like 30 min away just so I could get one right then while I wait on my dealer to get his supply. 

So I took suboxone yesterday and the day before and felt pretty damn good actually. No high, but no wd's. 

Then last night I'm with this girl at my buddies house, I've known her for a while. When it come time for me to head home she says ""hey, can I right back with you?"" So I tell her yeah come on. So we're in my car and we're taking and all of a sudden (I was kind of drunk) start tellin her about what I'm going through. Not the full thing because I wasn't trying to freak her out but you know, a little sneak peak. Then all of a sudden she starts telling me how recently she had been really depressed and even checked her self into therapy and all this. Then she tells me to pull over in a parking lot to finish talking. So I did and as soon as I stop she jumps over and gives me the biggest hug and a little peck on the lips (not sexual, it was an awesome like ""I'm here for you"" type thing) and were just hugging and she says ""you're not alone"". Well she ended up just coming home with me and spent the night. Bow chicka wow wow haha.  

But then today comes. I ran out of suboxone yesterday and was counting on my guy to have some by now but he didn't and says he's got some hydros if I really need some. So I get those then I walk to his neighbors house who took me to get them last time and asked if he had any. He did... I bought one. What I should've done was go back to my dealers house, give him the hydros back, tell him I found a suboxone, get my money back, and stuck to my word and not lied to myself and my bestfriend who's quitting with me. But instead I kept the hydros and took 5 and now I'm typing this. Tough week for me guys. Hope all of you are doing ok and aren't lying to yourselves or your friends cuz man it sucks. :/


TL;DR
Thinking about quitting, series of coincidences (or divine intervention if you believe that) make me really want to, meet a really cool girl, feel good about myself and my efforts, then piss it all away and lie to myself and best friend, when all I had to do was return the damn hydros. I fucking hate my stupid, selfish, addict brain. ",1390609070.0

I know it takes a nice amount of poppies to sustain a habit, but the nature of prohibition has made heroin, morphine, opium and derivatives some of the most valuable substances on the planet! 

So, I was hoping to have some nice dope porn for you kind folks today-I'm hoping I might have it tomorrow, but I wont be skipping out on my dose and making that mistake again.

I want them to feel every inch of me and I want to do the same to them... I don't think I've ever been hornier than when I've cuddled and had sex on H. It puts me in that super horny, super cuddly, super sensual/sexual, super submissive, ""do whatever the hell you want to me because I'm going to please you and get off doing it"" kind of vibe. Plus, if I'm fucking a girl, it makes it harder for me to cum so I can last super long and get them off again and again and again. It is hard for me to cum though, which kinda sucks, so it's a double edged sword.



It also helps me relax a lot and is pretty much the only way I can erm, 'take it' in certain places, which also feels amazing on H.



A perfect night for me would be good music, 2 attractive people of both sexes, one male, one female, sexy/kinky clothes and toys, and a gram of H. Also satin sheets, a chair, and a shag rug.



One day, I am going to make this happen.



Anyway, I'm rambling too much... I hear a lot about how H kills your sex drive but it's honestly only improved mine. Is it only when you are a heavy user?

This can include if a nasty hobbit took it.,"Such grief should not be kept bottled inside: let it out. Release the pain and agony of that dreaded moment when happiness was so cruelly snatched from your hopeless and now dopeless hands. (but most importantly stop losin yo drugs yo! jessus)

In solidarity, here is my own tragedy:

Last Saturday I got incredibly drunk for the first time in some months.* Drunkenness is reliable for me, because I know I will always a) drink until something stops me, whether it be another person or my own death, and b) when I start coming down and the following hours as I crash, I will crave H so severely and so desperately and so drunkenly that I will do anything for it. And when I mean desperate, I mean screaming, crying, slashing myself with razors or the blade of a scissors. Yeah...I try not to drink, like, ever.

Anyways, after my little mental breakdown I finally got ahold of a friend who was at a mini junkie jamboree and who was a bit of a cabs drive away that I did not remember. The rest of the night (well, technically Saturday morning) was crazy of course and filled with drugs, and I swear I've mentioned the fact I shot up a goofball (meth and h) for the first time there 1000 times here in the past week, and I am not sure why. I just want you guys to think I'm cool.

The first thing I did was buy a a dub off my friend. He comes over and places it on my tray I'm holding, and I sit down against the wall. I spend about 10 seconds at the most drunkenly digging in my pockets for a lighter, and when I look back at my tray, it's empty! 

It was a chunk of tar, so it had definitely just rolled off and was definitely findable. But after 20 minutes of me and my friend searching the 2 feet area the dope had been in before it disappeared, and then eventually the whole small room in case it had somehow been grew wings, it was still not turning up! And I don't think he actually found it and pocketed it because a) I did most of the looking, b) I could see him most of the time, as I was not blacking out anymore, and c) he was extremely fucked up on a combination that I don't even think he could be certain of at that moment and d) we're ""close"" friends (meaning I was going to fuck him later) so I definitely could have did some begging/pity-partying/manipulating to get him to give me another dub for free. I almost did get it for free, because I was paying him in the morning (I had to run to an ATM) and I forgot about losing the dope. He didn't even notice, I was the one that remembered last minute and paid him in full because I knew he would eventually remember and then secretly hold it against me and slowly come to hate me, even if it all happened almost entirely subconsciously, and I enjoyed his genitals (sorry, I'm not sure if thats true about the hating, I'm really high).

Luckily I was still pretty drunk and in a good mood because I was surrounded by friends and heroin, so I bought another dub without much thought and smoked that shit as fast as I could before it could escape. I kind of assumed I'd find the lost dub in the morning, because I was both very drunk and very glasses-less, and the place was dark and full of commotion. I mean, it was a sticky chunk of tar! There's no way it just catapulted across the room, and I tore apart every article of my clothing (well...I can't say I was the only one doing that...baDUMtiss!) but I never found it. So I wasted 20 bucks there that night, lost only one of my gauges so the other could stay behind and taunt me, and spent 20 bucks for the cab each way (ugh), because on Friday night I was too drunk and on Saturday afternoon because I was about to pass out. My heavy drinking from earlier Friday night and my (eventually) successful heroin use combined with my meth use in the weirdest way. It was fantastic for some time, of course, but then a hangover crashed into not sleeping for over a day from the meth which crashed into not eating, which crashed into crashing from feeling awesome from heroin and, yeah, there was no way I was going to figure out how to get home on a bus when I didn't even know where I was, except for the city name, which I still can't pronounce because it was not my city.

Of course now I am trying to figure out if someone else in the apartment stole the h from under my nose, because there were, like, 5 other people of which 2, at the LEAST, qualified for official junkie status in my eyes. They were really nice and we got along, but I don't think they were doing to well. Still, I lost it in such a short period of time and in such a small area that either they were fantastic thieves or I was just so completely trashed that they only had to be fairly excellent thieves to pull it off. 

THE END

TLDR; got dope (tar), put dope on tray, sat down, tried to find lighter, dope disappeared. Time: 10-20 seconds

*BONUS STORY!!! I ended up telling this story instead of the one I was meaning too...and this one is only slightly relevant and doesn't even involve any opiates. But I didn't want to just erase all my hard high work so here it is: Last Saturday I got extremely drunk for the first time in many months, due to an experience that involved me waking up in my bathtub surrounded by cold water, diarrhea, vomit, and a bunch of my soaking clothes. I was still wearing my own soaking clothes as well, which I realized I had not bothered to remove when I had decided to shit. There were both girls and boys crowded in my bathroom, standing over me and screaming at me to wake up, all of whom I had only met a month ago when school started. I have a habit of making good first impressions. They had no idea what they were doing, but I supported their general goal to keep me alive. A bunch of my clothes were in my bathtub because every time I'd start going unconscious, I'd start smashing the back of my head against the tub to wake myself up (""wakey wakey!""), and after they figured out they couldn't stop me from doing this they kept trying to put shirts and stuff behind my head, which the next morning I was thankful for because already my head hurt a lot for days. I think my brain subconsciously knew things were getting pretty bad, because I had drank more than I ever had and ever should and know I was passing out before I had thrown up. So  at one point I stuck my fingers down my throat, according to my new and fast friends, so I'd puke. I later saw a video of me doing this weird seizure thing on the ground too, kinda freaky. I also discovered they only became involved when I knocked on one of their doors and when it was opened literally just fell like a plank onto the ground, like out of a movie. Anyways, that was the first and so far still only time I have participated in drunk puking or drunk self-shitting, but to be fair I did puke voluntarily so hopefully you guys still think I'm pretty cool.

I only succeeded in poking about a 100 little holes in my arms, hands, and feet. Some of them bled a little bit, but no blood in the syringe. I think I might have had the needle in the right place at least a few times, but then I failed at pulling back: my fingers holding the syringe would slip down it due to me sweating and shaking from the adrenaline of excitement and anxiety. 

So I get dope (yay!), cook up a tiny shot (using a brand new needle) in the hopes it'll motivate me or something stupid like that. I knew the chances of pulling it off, before I caved in and just smoked myself asleep, were slim, but I had never even cooked a shot before so I wanted to do it, see it, smell it, pretend I knew what I was doing, etc. 

I hit that one vein in between your elbow and your wrist where others have had success shooting me up in the past. It goes in pretty easy and I feel the pop. I'm really excited now because I've been struggling with just getting the needle in far enough. I try to pull back on the syringe, but it's not working and the needle ends up sliding in kinda far. I don't know how far the needle should go in or what it should feel like exactly (I'm cursing myself for not paying better attention all the times I was shot up), but it slid in farther than all the other times I had tried. If I remember correctly, it didn't hurt though. It definitely did not hurt as bad as some of the times I've been shot up, so I tried to register again just in case. I failed, of course, and pulled out the needle.

Anyways, I'm aware I could have told this story in about 3 sentences, but I am waiting for my laundry to finish in the dryer and I am nodding in and out here alone, naked, scratching my entire body every 10 minutes and it feels fantastic.

So right after I pull the needle out it theres a little drop of blood and the skin starts to swell all around it and get red and splotchy, like has happened I'm sure to you guys too. It hurt/itch, so I applied pressure and rubbed it for about 20 seconds before getting distracted by the plan to do drugs. Now this morning I wake up (ok, technically 4 pm) and there is still swelling around it and then a bruised ring around that.

Why this is weird to me:
a) I've never gotten a purple ring around the swelling before. Also in the past I've had swelling right away, but the next day I always would be left with large purple and yellow areas (lots of yellow) with no swelling and no obvious center (like where the needle was stuck). I know other people have swelling though, so I am not worried.
b) I didn't even actually shoot up! I just stuck the needle in, pulled back a little bit of air or something, and then pulled the needle out.

To clarify, I'm basically just curious about the science behind this. I might suck at Google, but I couldn't find a lot of info on the various reactions you can get from injecting heroin. I didn't actually inject anything though, so does this mean my needle was dirty? Have any of you guys had a reaction after you failed to register and pulled the needle out to try again?

One last semi-related question: Should I avoid shooting up in a hematoma or other reaction until it's all gone? There's still a hard lump in my favorite vein in my elbow crook from when I shot up meth and h on Saturday. It has been slowly getting better, I believe, for it was extremely painful to move my arm at all the first 3-4 days and I am almost positive the lump is smaller. 

TLDR; I poked the needle in, it possibly slid too far (but I'm really not sure), I failed to register, I pulled out, and now the area (one day later) is still slightly red, swollen, and surrounded by a purple bruised ring.

And the licensing fee could help fund the program or something. Perhaps with opiates, stimulants, or benzos it would be best to try and put a nominal limit on the amount an user could purchase in a certain period of time and otherwise discourage full blown addiction while promoting available options for tapering down and getting totally clean.

i am walking

cold wind binds to my hair 

and naked thighs.

its new years eve,

and I walk for miles

despite the chill.



as i catch snowflakes on my tongue

i dream of you,

of your warmth engulfing me,

a smooth blanket

to soften my frozen limbs.



before we met,

I knew it would be love.

our first touch 

knocked me off my feet,

a kiss that burned

with bitter sweetness.



you stayed for weeks,

comforting me

on lonely nights,

the only reprieve

from my spinning grey matter.



I had begun to shut the world out

If I had you, 

what more could i need?



But they shook their fingers,

told me you were bad news,

begged me to let you go.

the longer you stayed,

the more i needed you.



without you,

l lay sick in bed,

crying out for your return.



before long,

I was crippled by your love

waxing to your wane,

living and breathing

my days 

solely on your existence.



as I ached for you,

I knew it couldn’t last,

you were too beautiful to keep,

and I was too addicted 

to the thrill of your touch.



so on new years eve,

i walk with frigid numbness

reminiscing of our brief affair,

longing for your taste,

a gentle coarseness 

that brought me to my knees,

my love in a bag for ten dollars. ",1390691684.0

1w4dwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1w4dwa/crazy_vivid_dream_story_time/,25,https://redd.it/1w4dwa,DegenerateSubgenius,Crazy Vivid Dream Story Time,"So last night I ended up shooting about 120 mg of morphine and after trying unsuccessfully falling asleep to astronomy documentaries (which usually work for me, what with their soothing voiceovers and amazing space CGI visuals) I arrived at a state of lucid dreaming in which I was creating a movie that I was watching at the same time I was rewriting and editing it.

It was all about a married couple renovating their bathroom. From the molecular level, though. 
The protagonist, I'll call him Neil, is some kind of applied physics researcher and he has figured out a way to teleport matter to a parallel dimension. This discovery makes him incredibly rich because suddenly the company he works for can dispose of all this unwanted matter. Toxic waste, medical biohazardous stuff, whatever, he just puts it in a little area in front of his machine and, poof, it's gone. He doesn't know where, but it doesn't matter. The Unmaker just makes it disappear. 

But not being the type to just stop with one success, Neil figures out how to transform the atoms in the stuff the Unmaker disappears into whatever else he wants that could be made from those atoms. So then the machine goes from having one compartment to having two: one where you put base matter in and one where whatever you want comes out. There were various scenes of Neil and his family using the device, now a Maker, of course, in their various daily activities. From literally making breakfast to creating ornaments for a Christmas tree (as well as the tree itself) to fixing broken toys and mending torn clothing, etc. 

So, he figures out how to enlarge the machine to renovate entire rooms of his house and this is where the conflict comes in. No matter what Neil does, his wife (I'll call her Dani), is unsatisfied with the master bathroom. Dani, of course, doesn't know specifically what's wrong with it ""It just doesn't feel *warm* enough,""  she complained after Neil's latest design with contoured jade and mahogany for the large bathtub and fixtures, etc. Or, ""It's just too *modern*"" for a design with a lot of glass and brushed stainless steel. 

Anyway, when Dani and Neil were having the argument that resolved into where the whole moral of the story is exposed (I guess that you just have to keep trying and even then nothing will be good enough but the fact that you're hearing her out and really *listening* is what matters) my critical brain kicked in and said, ""Wait a minute here. You're messing with parallel dimensions and transubstantiation of matter on an atomic level here! You should have some kind of consequences!!! How about some monsters like [Eldrazi?""](https://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/stf/88) 

I guess at this point, I start to see the world at large that had come to embrace Maker technology begin to see these otherworldly creatures blinking in and out of existence. Parts of peoples bodies start turning translucent or outright vanishing. Buildings start having entire sections go missing. People start walking though walls and get stuck halfway. Why is all this happening? Well, unbeknownst to Neil in his quest to give his wife the perfect master bathroom, teleporting and transforming matter weakens the fabric of spacetime unless a lot of shielding is used in the area around the Unmaker part of the Makers. Which, at this point, have been mass-produced and marketed widely. 

Right around the time when the transdimensional monsters I wanted start appearing and just killing and destroying without rhyme or reason, adding to the overall state of general chaos in the world, I decided that it would be a good time to follow Neil and Dani's daughter to a historical site where she was reading a plaque with an inscription so disturbing that I forced myself to wake up fully and type this up.

Well, I hope I was able to at least partially convey my experience and I was wondering if any of you have had any cool vivid dream/hallucination experiences while on opiates or if I'm the only one with an overactive imagination to accompany a debilitating addiction.

TL;DR I had a crazy vivid dream while semi-unconscious on opiates and maybe a (somewhat) decent idea for a screenplay.

Can you be equally addicted to heroin and let's say... meth! at the same time? Is there another substance that has withdrawals as bad as heroin where you would really notice being addicted to both? I can only think of alcohol right now, but I can't imagine someone pulling off a serious addiction to h and booze at the same time. I'd think you'd die trying to get high before you could even experience w/ds.

What I'm trying to ask is this probably-poorly-worded-cuz-im-noddin' hypothetical question: Say for some months every day I smoked h, and every time I also smoked g/meth. Now when I stop I'll obviously have pretty unpleasant w/ds, but do you guys think if then I only smoke h, I'll feel better, particularly physically, but might still feel mental depression/anxiety/craving for g? I'd think if I just smoked meth I'd definitely still crave h and feel like shit, since h seems to overpower everything, but I'm curious about vice versa. Would I be super high, nodding out, but in some part of my brain still freakin out for meth?

What if in that same situation you starting taking subs to get off h? would you be going though g withdrawals while you were on subs?

Well let's start from the beginning. There was a robbery where I lost 1,300. What I didn't tell you was it was someone ease's money. I really fucking hate myself for this, and have actually just completely stopped talking to her because I can't face the guilt.

So anyways, here I am the next day with a black eye, in withdraw and hurting more than I ever have in my entire life. My family wanted to send me to rehab ASAP but I protested. I completely stopped doing opiates and thought they were the worst thing in the fucking world. 

A few days later, after struggling with what had just happened, the guilt form losing someone else's money which I knew I couldn't repay, and the fact that my family absolutely hated me. So I tried to kill myself. I downed an entire bottle of kpin's, took nearly 1400mg of DPH and finished it off with an entire bottle of asprin. My dads girlfriend found me unresponsive maybe an hour or two after taking the medication. I woke up in the hospital 2 days later and cried because what I had tried to do didn't work. 

I went straight from the hospital to rehab, spent about a week or so there and after having a hell of a time, and my doctor not giving me the right sub dosage I got extremely angry and left. I actually walked home. This wasn't all that long ago. 

My father allowed me to stay home and put me in outpatient where I am again, now on suboxone. They still can't get my dosage right but at least it wasn't as bad as rehab. I got my phone back a few days ago and still haven't contacted this girl.

Then I did something really bad... I knew she had been spreading rumors about me. Saying I did something I didn't, along with robbing her. So I contacted her dealer and said she was a narc. This almost makes me more of a piece of shit. I really fucking hate myself and in all honesty I just don't want to be in this world anymore.

I miss dope more than anything, and after my Finace (who some of you may know) dumped me I completely lost it. The past few days I've been on the hustle for dope, but with no access to my bank account and no buddy who trusts me I've hit a wall. 

I just don't know what to do. I don't know how to apologize to this girl. I don't know how to continue my life. 

Look. I love all you guys more than my entire family. You guys get me, you understand what this kind of shit is like. But I seriously don't know what to do. All I do is stay up at night and hate my life. 

One fucking deal ruined the last thing I had left. I might get back on me, and I'm being serious with this: dope is the only thing that has ever given me pure happiness. I'm not going to quit. I just want to mend my relationships, hopefully repay this girl when I get enough money, and get back on track.

Also, to moxy, afterthestormcalms, and all my other IRC buddy's, I love you guys. I hope you haven't bought into the rumors. 

Anyways, if anyone has any ideas how to remedy this situation I've put myself in, please chime in. And it feels good just to be posting again. I love all of you! And I just recently learned of Chris's death and that saddens me more than anything! I didn't really talk to him much but his comments always made me laugh. 

I hope you guys can forgive me. I want to make amends.

One reason I've enjoyed opiates, though, is because they don't ""fuck me up"". I still feel like my brain is working normally, and I can get things done. People on benzos are often slurring their speech, and forgetting what they're talking about mid sentence, and things like that.

Didn't have any withdrawals besides a headache (I don't usually take more than 40-60 mg every other day).

The month went by, I found a new connection for Oxys.  I can safely say that although I feel nicer than I did before I quit, there has been an obvious increase in permanent tolerance.  Scientifically, my opiod receptors should have repaired themselves with that amount of downtime, and my tolerance should have been reset.

Basically I want you guys opinion on wether or not this should be something I need to be worried about. I have no health insurance, so I'm trying to save going to the hospital as a very last resort.

I live in a city with a couple needle exchanges. I go in bi-weekly to pick up new rigs, spoons, water ect. The clinic itself is located inside a public health building that is usually very busy with all sorts of people but somehow I always end up seeing the same nurse to make the exchange. She knows me by face but we never exchange names.

Today was like any other day. I register at the front desk and wait my turn. The nurse comes out and we go into the back examining room and she asks what I need. As she is putting together my kit I am throwing out my old stuff into a large sharps container and making small talk. I throw out old baggies, dirty spoons, filters, basically all the garbage in the bottom of my backpack. After we are both finish I head out the door to head to school. About two and a half hours of class go by and I'm starting to feel the itch. I want my next shot before I start my homework. I head to the single serve bathroom and begin to prepare. But something is missing... oh fuck... you didn't... there is no way you could have... Between the small talk with the nurse and me tossing old baggies into the sharps container I accidentally threw out my baggie with 20 - 2mg dillies out. I panic. I'm not getting paid for another couple of days. I NEEDED those to last. As my mind races to figure out a plan I decide my first course of action should be to head back to the exchange and see if there is absolutely anything they can do. Back at the exchange I meet with my regular nurse. She can sense my panic. I ask her if we can speak privately in the same room we did the exchange. I explain my story and before I can even start pleading for her to allow me to check the sharps container that must have contained 100's of needles she places her hand on my shoulder and says ""We will do our absolute best to find what you lost."" This woman is a saint. Calm, collective, compassionate, understanding. She knows I am looking for my drugs. We open the large sharps container and right on top is my baggie full of 20 dillies. She pulls them out and hands them to me. I could not thank her enough for taking time to help out a junkie. She said they would normally never open the sharps container but understands how sick I could be from losing so much. I wish I could send this lady a thank you card explaining how grateful and touched I am that someone helped me out when it was my own stupid fault for not being my careful. All I can do is pass on the kindness and compassion.

TLDR; Went to the needle exchange and ended up tossing out 20 - 2mg dillies. Went back hours later and the nurse opens the sharp container and fishes the baggie out for me.",1390876994.0

Only the last one left a voicemail... It was a buddy of mine in treatment who wants another friends number, as he deleted all his contacts and only remembered some numbers. He called his friend who didn't have the number, but that person gave him my number, as I am friends with the man he's looking for. 

He's calling back in 50 minutes. What's the deal? Why is the number blocked, do ya think? I don't want to get in trouble by association, I've had skin in the game, and I don't need no scrubs digging into my life. Especially if they're law enforcement. 


I want to help him if he's legit into trouble, though. I'll play dumb if I answer him later, I think. Lemme know what you think. ",1390871542.0
1wbuz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1wbuz6/the_worst_way_to_get_free_drugs/,51,https://redd.it/1wbuz6,Opiad,The worst way to get free drugs.,"Today I was coming home from a nice pickup.  It was nice out, and sunny, and I had gotten a decent gram of the quality stuff that my guy sells.  I'm leaving his neighborhood, and it really embodies the latter, and I see this man come up to my window several times.  He is holding what looks like a tums, and a band-aid.  It was surreal.  He made a window rolling motion down, and waved and pointed and stuff.  I was trying to drive.  My girlfriend is freaking out.  I run the red light I am stopped at trying to get away.  It was majorly uncomfortable.  I hadn't even gotten to hit my shit yet!  

Flash forward a few minutes.  We've stopped at our traditional blow spot, and Jesus Christ, the guy from the red light is in a car, and has followed us here.

""HOLY SHIT.""  We quickly police up our dope, and I drive away.  Since in the 30 seconds as they were trying to park next to us, the man has made it apparent that he wants to talk to us.  A goddamn band aid.  

We head home.  I keep an eye out in the mirror as we drive away.  I think we get through a light and are ok.  I get my knife as I leave to pay the attendant for gas.  I put it in my back pocket.  I tell my girlfriend to first call the cops, then not open the windows or unlock the doors.  

As I'm looking out I see the car pull past, and the guy turn and look.  They point.  Drive down the road.  Somehow I know they're coming back.  I see them pull up behind us as I frantically pray for the gas to pump faster. 

""Why did I put so much money in?""  Still not even high yet.  Fuck.  Hand on my knife in my back pocket,  I turn one hand still pumping gas.  

""Hey what do you want?!""  
  
(I could not really understand him very well, and do not remember the conversation enough to accurately write an actual conversation.  Even the above words are just guess/feelings/emotions at the time... I know, it kills the magic.)

We proceeded to gather that he was trying to give us dope.  the little tums looking pill I had seen was actually a cut from a finger.  The bandaid, had ""chino"" written on it, with a number. 

This is what I remember...

""A sample, you try, like it, call the number.""

The whole thing was fucked.  He spent 7 minutes repeating that, the whole thing generally about that.  He had followed us for twenty minutes a good 2-5 miles.  Just to give us a gram for a sample for a potential sale?  I was freaking out, and he was a really sketchy man.  Combine with where we were.  I have never put my knife in my pocket for protection before.

We get excited in the car as we drive away.  Free gram!!!  WOO HOO

On the off thought, we call our guy to ask him about it, since the man who had stopped us, had repped our dealer.

He spent 10 minutes telling my girl not to do it, that he didn't know any ""chino"" and that it was bad and would make her sick.  He said his friend had had the same experience, except he had just said yes at first, and not had the sketchy followed experience.  He ended up getting a big red rash, and ended up in the hospital 30 minutes later.

I really trust our guy, and he seemed genuine concerned about my girl so we are definitely holding off on sampling our free dope.  It may actually be krokodil, or just shitty dope or something.  But until I have a testing kit and can test it, it is not going in my nose.

**TL;DR**
Got window tapped, and followed twice from my dealer's house to our snort spot to the gas station by a sketchy band aid man.  He did that so he could give us a free sample gram of dope. Called dealer, maybe got krokodil.  Not touching it til I test it.

It is a good story, you should read the whole thing.   

EDIT:  I know it is probably not krokodil.  But I'm still not sure it's heroin.  I haven't taken it out of the bag yet.  Fingers crossed.  I think I might try some later today, if I do, I'll let y'all know.

EDIT 2: It is dope!  Free gram!!!! But.......................  It is not very good.  Oh well.  Free bad dope is still free dope.  Did it all, mostly high.

I wrote this to my mother to try to help her understand.  My little sister overdosed & died a year & six months ago and my mother doesn't understand why that's not enough for me to stop.**




When I have a needle in my arm, I hurt everyone who loves me in one way or another.  I want to try to explain something about me and most of the addicts I know.  This is not an excuse for the choices I made, but it is my truth.  An active addiction is like eating when you are hungry.  The hunger doesn't go away until the need is met, the cruel paradox being that the hunger never fades.  I'm compelled to feed my addiction, even when it goes against everything I wish I could be.  I know that daily my actions continue to torment so many people, but I don’t do it on purpose, *my addiction doesn’t let it matter.*







Why do I do this?  The simple answer is that every time that needle enters my arm and the poison flows freely I experience a bliss that can’t compare in the slightest, nothing in my life seems worth stopping for.  Imagine feeling good about yourself, life seeming enjoyable, and then when you wake up all that has changed, life is complete shit again.  You once again begin the rat race until you have a bag of dope.  Life is empty without it, there is nothing to replace it with, nothing that could even began to compensate the satisfaction.  You look at yourself in the mirror and realize just how low you have sunk.  It seems like the hole you’ve dug is just too deep, *the point of no return passed a long time ago.*  You just think ""screw it"" and carry on with the drugs.  Heroin gives you a feeling that everything is manageable, nothing is that bad and everything can wait until tomorrow.









The thing many loved ones come to believe is that every decision I make is designed to hurt them.  Why else would I be afflicting such pain on them unless I didn't care how my actions effected them?  This is a common misconception among loved ones of junkies.  This line of thinking is completely inaccurate, I never once stopped loving my family and friends.  I will never stop loving June, she was my best friend and little sister.  *The harsh truth is that in my addiction, it doesn’t come into the equation at all.*  All of my choices and actions are based solely on my need to acquire and use heroin.  









Junkies are human beings capable of love just like any other person. I never stopped loving my family when I was using. We are not totally void of feelings, we are people with a problem.  In my drug addled mind I will always love you, at the same time I’m thinking about how much I hate myself for putting my loved ones through this.  I hate the person I’ve become and for doing what I’m doing right now.  I love you with all the means that I’ve got, and I don’t have much because heroin is my priority.  *The love will always be there but it is as repressed as my soul is.* 










In the end the heroin can only stifle so much of the misery.  Isolation becomes a necessity, essential to the survival of my sanity.  Resentment built up that you keep staying when all I do is close the door and go to the bathroom.  Friendship and avoidable intimacy just lengths the list of people I have to burden.

Everything is anonymous. They give you free needles alcohol swabs cookers etc. They apparently stopped giving out micron filters. They increase the amount of needles every time you bring back old used needles. Since this was my first time they gave me 15 needles. The nice lady there said she would increase the needles just as long as I bring back used needles. Here's a picture of everything. http://imgur.com/9dam3tR

Oh IMPORTANT thing I forgot to mention is that you receive a card. The card allows you to have needles and not get charged with paraphernalia charges by the police. EVEN USED NEEDLES!!! If the police are assholes and they do decide to charge you anyway even with the card, you can bring your charge papers to the Paterson needle exchange program and they will drop all charges (only the paraphernalia charges). 

The address is 207 Broadway Paterson NJ. The hours I think are Mon,Tues,Wed,Fri 9AM-11AM, 1PM-4PM. The phone number is 973-523-0700.

The main reason I went is for the card. But, hey, FREE NEEDLES!!!

Here's a technique to save a persons life when they fall out. It saved a friends life.,"So recently my friend **@reeferryan** here on Reddit received a two bag shot and fell out. I used this technique to save his life and used it on another friend who also fell out.

-----

Now before you use this method remember it is always best to avoid the possibility of ODing. Never shoot bags without sampling them. Just because it's the same branding or bag doesn't mean the quality will be consistent. People constantly use different/stronger adulterants to cut product and use a different ratio at which they cut the product with. 

-----

**Technique:**

Take your fist and with your knuckles (I use the ones above my fingers at the bottom of your fist) and rub the center of the persons chest, the solar-plexus as hard as you can. Like really dig your knuckles into the persons chest. It's going to hurt them without a doubt. I did it to my friend and his chest hurt for two days or so. This should awake them, afterwards keep them stimulated by getting up and walking around. If they continue to lose consciousness (which they shouldn't if you keep them stimulated) you might want to get them medical attention.

-----

**You can read my story here on how I saved his life below:** http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1wdygy/heroin_laced_with_fentanyl_blamed_for_22_deaths/cf1cu16

-----

Also from what I've read if you have Suboxone close by you can shoot them up with it if I'm not mistaking. The naxalone or bupe n the Suboxone will unbind the opioid from the receptors almost immediately when injected. Again, this is from anecdotal stories I've read where Suboxone ended up saving someones life.

-----

Thank you to **@traceyh415** for the technique. I saw her post it months ago and felt it needs more attention. Its always best to call 911 in the event of an OD but using the above technique can save time, which is crucial in the event of an OD.",1390987538.0

I've been creeping these forums for a while now looking for guidance with PST and still have some lingering questions. A little background is that I weigh about 130 lbs and used to frequent opiates. However, this was two/three years ago. I started off using hydrocodone for about 6 months and progressed to shooting dope for another six months. I didn't get out of control and stuck with about 1-2 shots a day. Then due to various circumstances, I quit. 

With that being said my questions are:
1) Are any seeds in grocery stores viable or should I go straight to online ordering? I have been to various establishments looking for bulk seeds: Indian, Mexican, and Asian groceries as well as Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. However, they did not carry ANY poppy seeds. Kroger did however carry McCormick's and Spice Islands. I assumed both of these would be bunk but have seen on other various forums that Spice Islands worked OK for a rook. (McCormick's has never gotten a ""legit"" review, Spice Islands was 50:50)
2) If Spice Islands is applicable for a ""is it worth the time kinda run"" how many grams of seeds should I buy for a single brew? I assume no matter what Spice Islands would be much weaker than various online vendors. If Spice Islands is NOT viable, what is a good starting amount for online seeds?
3) Is it possible to measure approximate seed mass by volume? i.e. 2 cups seeds/lb seeds   or something to that tune.


Cheers/Happy Nods/Thank you!

/edit
In case anyone is lurking and has similar questions as I did, here is an update:
Tonight I decided I would just give it a go with some grocery store brand seeds (distributed by the grocery itself). I used 240g of seeds and did two, 10 minute RT water + lemon juice washes. The filtrate was a opaque gray color. I drank the liquid on an empty stomach and in about 30 minutes my limbs feel very heavy and I was very relaxed. After an hour my pupils are quite constricted. I would equate the sensation to taking a couple hydrocodone. Keep in mind that at this point I likely have no tolerance. Would definitely try again, hopefully with some more organic seeds!",1390955271.0

The cravings are so bad I have actually considered theft, just to get some dope. This is something I have never done before, but right now looks like a rational choice.

What is making it worse is the fact I have cash in the bank, but no way of accessing it as my wife still has my cards.

The only way I can describe it is HELL. I just feel like giving up, going out and mugging someone and scoring.

So, for all those just starting out in the world of opiates and heroin, just take 5 mins to think. Because once you start, its hard to stop.

I know in a few days I will have cash in my hand, and I have the ok to go score. But that's not helping me tonight. Tonight i, well, I can't even begin to describe how shit I feel.

I know some of you might be thinking this is the most retarded thing you've ever heard, how can you hide it from yourself?

I'm trying to put together a list that organizes commonly-used opiates/opiods based on how much they depress a given person's breathing (hypoventilation), assuming the person ingests an equivalent dose of the different opiates (see equianalgesic chart*). I get that the amount of hypoventilation for each opiate will differ slightly from person to person. 
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic

My ultimate goal is to:
1) Categorize the 'well-known' opiates into the sections: heavy hypoventilation caused, medium hypoventilation caused, and little/no hypoventilation caused.
2) Then, categorize the 'well-known' opiates into those same categories, assuming they are also mixed with alcohol. (thus acting as a reference for others to know what opiates are most dangerous to mix w/ alcohol)
3) Categorize all 'well-known' CNS depressants into the categories listed in my first goal.

I've created a very rough draft, and will continue to work on it myself, but i'd greatly appreciate any help anyone could give (any info on the intensity of hypoventilation for a given drug, for example). If anyone wants to help fill out/organize this that would be awesome. I'm not a scientist and have no formal education in pharmacology (or whatever other field of science deals with this stuff), so everything I know comes from wikipedia, erowid, and some medical research PDFs.

PLEASE post here so you can convince me to write it all out. Or not I just needed to tell someone to get it off my chest. 

Basically last night me and my bestfriend got dope which he snorted for the first time in a year. We get roxis occasionally (once a week) but because I had lost all my connects I was forced to shoot roxis to stave withdrawal. 

Well that all changed today when I got up with a friend from Philly who had acquired a couple buns of the infamous fent bags. I shot 3 at first was in heaven. I ended up grabbing a few bags of street quality dope in case my best friend wanted some to snort.

Instead he decides he wants me to shoot him up. I did it without question. After about 30 seconds of the drug being in him i saw him fall into his closet wall and got scared. That was only incident of the night but I'm feeling really bad about it. Once you go there you really don't go back. I already got him started with weed at a young age and now he's shooting up. He had said something along the lines of ""if u dont do it for me I'll do it myself"" but in the end thats just a bullshit excuse. 

I really feel terrible. Make me feel worse or better. Just say something =[",1391072328.0

I myself wouldn't try drugs, too dangerous and not worth it.

So, all that follows is my friend's story, written from their perspective:
I tried the stamp bags sold as heroin in Southwestern Pennsylvania that actually contain Fentanyl.

They did not contain ANY heroin. 

When mixed with water, there was NO tint. Dope around here ALWAYS has a tint; even the purest bags that taste and feel like heroin have a yellowish tint when you mix 5 of them (i.e. half a gram of dope) with 1/2cc of water. Many bags are quite dark when mixed in those amounts. None are clear.

These did not have ANY tint whatsoever.

I assumed I had been ripped off. The bags were not in the news yet. I hadn't heard of anyone dying from them at that point.

I banged it anyways...

IDK if I missed a small amount, but I felt that they were strong -- but not dope -- and I remember feeling glad I didn't get ripped off, and calling for a friend. Just a minute or two later, after the friend had come to me, I started to go out. I don't remember anything after calling for the friend, but they said that I was shaking a bit, trying to stand and failing, and then eventually falling to the floor despite their efforts to prop me up and settle me on the ground safely.

I ODed.

The friend could not pick me up.

I ended up waking up 10 minutes later with my face on the floor.

I did not feel especially high, or really high at all. I definitely didn't feel a strong heroin-type high. My eyes were pinned though, and the most obvious signs of dopesickness were absent. (I was in mild WD when I used the substance.) Any time I have woken up within an hour or even two hours of OD'ing on dope and simply reviving on my own or being slapped awake, I have been very high, and nodding out like I was going to become completely unconscious again.

So, I wasn't high, I had almost OD'ed. Great. I go to bed. Well, all night, I had a bit of the sweats, or it felt that way. I was sweating. I was rolling around. In other words, I felt like I was dopesick even though my eyes were pinned.

It just sucked -- if you are someone who likes their heroin, this pure fentanyl (or acetylfentanyl, I suppose) SUCKS.

It's killed over 25 people in this area in the past two weeks or so. 

SO DON'T SEEK IT OUT -- IT KILLS AND IT GIVES YOU A SHITTY HIGH COMPARED TO EVEN VERY AVERAGE HEROIN. IT IS NOT CUT HEROIN, AT LEAST NOT IN THE ""THERAFLU brand"" BAGS  I GOT -- IT IS PURELY THE SYNTHETIC OPIOID THAT IS KILLING AND NOT EVEN GIVING GOOD WARM HIGHS TO THOSE THAT SURVIVE.",1391065236.0

I've been plagued by a stomach infection for the last year or so and opiates are the only thing that allows me to eat without pain. I've been lucky enough to have a very good friend supply me with roxicodone 15mg that I cut into fourths and use as needed. Sadly, she was unable to help me this week and I needed to turn to other sources to purchase. 

Tonight, I received some blue pills with the imprint of K 9 on them. My google-fu is telling me that they are generic oxycodone 30 mg. No worries there - I'll just have to take less. My worry comes with breaking them down. I can't seem to find out if these are an extended release or not. I'm not terribly experienced in the world of opiates but have heard that breaking the coating on extended release tablets can be bad (or really good but not what I'm looking for). Also, if I am only taking a fourth - am I ingesting 7.5 mg or 30 that will just not last as long?

I woke up at 8 am sick as a dog. I had taken a half mg of orange flavored defeat (aka suboxone for those who aren't familiar) 24 hours ago. But I didn't care, I have a half gram of fine tar in the mail with my name on it and it was scheduled to arrive between noon and one pm today. Once again my friendly mail carrier was the only person I cared to see today. After an agonizing 4 hour wait until noon, I was sitting on the front porch acting casual as I waited for that lovely little white truck to drive down my street. 1230 rolls around the mail isn't here. I decide to stretch my legs and hopefully relieve my RLS a little bit. Of course as soon as I get to the end of the street I see my best friend in his funny little uniform about a block away. Salvation has arrived! I just need to wait, a junkie's favorite thing of course. I walk around the block a bit and as I get back to my street, the mailman is finished with my block. It took all my power to not sprint home. Gotta keep my cool, ya know. I open the mailbox. There's a couple magazines. A couple tax forms. And there's a red envelope with my name on it and no return address!!

It's a god damn card from my uncle. I haven't talked to this cat in 6 months. He doesn't even like me. What the fuck Bruce? Don't fuck with me. Naturally, I curse the heavens, the United States Postal Service, the President, the weather, and myself for thinking the USPS would deliver something across the state two and a half days after it was mailed. Of course my dope hasn't arrived, that would just be too convenient. But there is still some hope, I have 1.25 mg of suboxone in my stash still. I pop the .25 under my tongue (I have a rather important trip coming up this weekend that I'd hate to be sick and sit in the car for 5 hours for). It's barely kicking in when I go on the hunt. There's gotta be something in this fucking house that'll keep me from clawing my eyes out and pacing the house in this delightful curse we junkies suffer from. I find a couple trazodone and some ambien so I'll at least be able to sleep a couple hours tonight. And that's when I see it. A bottle of 5/500 hydrocodone. I don't know how I've missed it. I've torn this bathroom apart more than I can count in sickness and have never seen this. My wonderful sister kept her pills after getting her wisdom teeth out. Sis, I love you. You're the best. So .25 mg of sub, 20 mg of hydrocodone, and 2000 mg of our friend APAP I am a human being again. And it's only 4. Today is looking up, and, if I dare trust the USPS tomorrow, will be even better with a half gram of beautiful H.

I apologize for the length, I'm just excited (haven't had to say that in a year or two) but if anybody's still reading here I got me some questions.

With a full functioning liver (no history with booze or pills, just heroin, pot and some occasional amphetamine binges) what should my goal for maximum APAP be over the course of today and tomorrow?

Is trazodone + ambien a good idea? Should I just stick to the trazodone? It's good for ~5 hours of sleep once I can get there. Or should I go with the ambien? What's a good dose of ambien to knock my ass out without getting too weird?

Hope everybody's day is as good as mine has been the past two hours, and I hope everybody is catching a good nod or enjoying sober-living.
