Well I‚Äôve only gone to one na meeting place same spot, same time maybe about 10-12 different times (I know ppl say try different meetings but this was the only one I would Find that said open to everyone) hence why I went where as some I guess where more step based meetings this was a welcome new comers meeting 

But, man these meetings where so weird and uncomfortable they where either extremely hostile bitter and outright confrontational or so dark and depressing it would kind of remind me of scared straight more than anything and when anybody would get a turn to speak they would always talk almost disgusted like ‚ÄúI see people come and go and we‚Äôre always welcoming them back after they relapse we‚Äôll im sick of that shit I‚Äôve been clean for 2 years and when I fucked up everybody turned there back on me I had to pull myself up‚Äù or they would compare there addictions to other ppls ‚Äúlike when I was using I would use everything coke,crystal anything I could get my hands on that‚Äôs an addiction but when I hear kids talking about pills! pills?!

Idk I would always leave these meetings feeling worse, I mean I wasn‚Äôt expecting some dr drew level of discussions of what led us to our drug of choice and what were the underlying issues that led us down our current path.

I recently switched from 16mg a day of suboxone strips to two of the 5.7 pills a day. I‚Äôm not sure if it was something in the strip or the nalaxone inside of it(yes I ducking know zubsolv has nalaxone also) that for some reason every time I took my morning strip I would have to take 3 excedrin or I would get a massive headache. I tried the spitting method and that didn‚Äôt work either so maybe it‚Äôs just something in the strip, who knows.  But ever since I switched to these zubsolv pills everything has been working and going SO much better. My cravings are lower and you can snort or shoot them to satisfy your ritual cravings as well. I know for me when I was on strips I would pop it in my mouth and give myself a baby like just to satisfy the ritual side of things. I‚Äôve been switched for a few weeks now and I‚Äôve been taking them sublingual in the morning and or plugging which I‚Äôve definetly gotten used to lol, let‚Äôs just say a baby oral syringe feels like a big ass finger if you‚Äôve never had anything up ur booty hole before and I can catch a decent buzz that satisfies my cravings better than Doritos, and shooting my night pill. Believe it or not you can actually catch a somewhat decent buzz off these minty bad boys, I‚Äôm having trouble keeping my eyes open while typing this watching two and a half men. The only bad side effect I have noticed is that the constipation seems to be a bit worse than strips, but then again it‚Äôs a pretty big dose to be taking every day. Anyways i caught or still am catching a little baby nod off shooting my night pill 45 min ago. Just curious does anyone else use a contact container to mix their shit for shooting? I think it makes things so much easier because I can break the pill up, throw in 33cc water and shake it up for about ten seconds, throw a cotton in to filter and slam away. Boom good to go, it also leaves a nice minty aftertaste :) So I‚Äôm just wondering which ROA do you prefer because I‚Äôve done them all. Do you like in the mouth? Do you like it in the ass? Or do you like to slam those bad boys? Just curious to start conversation because I haven‚Äôt had a craving for heroin in over a year since starting bupe treatment, I‚Äôm hoping I can talk my doctor into switching me to subutex by convincing them I‚Äôve never shot anything up and the nalaxone gives me a headache and an upset stomach, which is what the strips did, but not with the zubsolv. Idk if I want to risk messing up a good thing with a better thing or just stay on the two zubs a day. I doubt they would switch me anyways they are kind of ass fucks and treat everyone like addicts by being rude and acting like they are better than them but who cares they keep
Me alive and prescribed me benzos also for the first six months. Holy fuck I‚Äôve been rambling for a long time now. So my main question is what‚Äôs your favorite form of bupe? And what‚Äôs your favorite ROA to use it?

I allowed myself to continuously be fooled; fooled by my false belief that human beings are never born inherently bad, evil. When I was a boy I was taught that monsters weren‚Äôt real- no one told me of the monsters that man could become. And so, with the stab of a needle I became one of those monsters, and it would be a long time before I could claw my way back to being a man. 

I didn‚Äôt get to choose my confessions when I was out there shooting drugs;  instead like some sort of homeless fashion model I wore my confessions.  I dressed in track marks, dereliction, cynicism, and a voice of weakness. I was a perpetual victim. I wore those confessions, and I‚Äôll tell you there ain‚Äôt a man alive who wore them with less pride than me. 

And that day it rained so hard, I still think about that day a year later. I saw that one couple I talked to my junkie Friends about til they were blue in the face, I saw em‚Äô sitting outside the little French restaurant that I knew I could never afford. Their waiter had just dropped off the bill. And they play fought for that bill, and she smiled and he laughed and in the end she held it tightest. And then they kissed, and I‚Äôd swear to this day that the good Lord Himself timed that rain to  come down in buckets the second their lips touched and I tasted that rain- the same rain they tasted. And I just stood there, letting the rain wash away my confessions and wondering what it would be like to be her, to be him. What was that like, love? What‚Äôs it like to share a smile, share a poem, a laugh, a touch? What would that be like, to love, on a random Thursday in a God timed rain on a hot summer day in June?

See, when you‚Äôre a junkie like me you don‚Äôt get to choose your confessions.

\-Withdrawl seems SUPER mild from long term/high dose reports (its amazing to me, how a wonderful drug, provides so little... consequences.. when your going on 10+ years, the thought of long term benzo withdrawal, i can honestly say, outweigh benefits)

\-Doesn't pop on a drug test (maybe a dipstick but its 2019)

\-Seems like a solid fucking alternative to benzos

My bf and I just shot up, he took about 1/3 of a gram, which is close to his normal does at a time. After his shot he nodded a little and when he came to (within less than a minute) he was convinced I had passed out right after my shot (approximately a point, maybe a little more) which I am 110% sure I did not. I know without a doubt in my mind I did not pass out, nod, od or anything close. I did not even close my eyes! He told me he is 110% sure I passed out and he slapped me lightly across the face twice and then once harder which revived me, all while saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt OD!‚Äù over and over. Normally I would accept what he told me because in the past I have passed out and even overdosed a few times and he hit me with narcan, but like I said this time NOTHING came close to that, I barely even felt a rush. I asked him if it was possible that he imagined it or is mistaking it for another night. He said no, and that I just don‚Äôt remember because I passed out. 
What the fuck?! I don‚Äôt know what to think, is he losing his mind?! He clearly lost touch with reality for a little while. He‚Äôs fine now, but is sure the scenario played out the way he describes it. Can using heroin cause this? Should I be concerned about psychosis?

(Posted this in r/drugs too)

My phone has been blowing the fuck up with all the various news outlets reporting on this.

Apparently, an opioid overdose is now the #1 cause of accidental death in America - statistically more likely to kill you than the chance of a car crash. 

Opioid OD odds: 1 out of 96 people 

Car crash odds: 1 out of 103 people

Stay safe out there, everyone!

So i was clean for a long time then about 2 - 1.5 months ago i started taking roxy (legit script) prob 3 times a day.

However, over the past 3 weeks - month I legit have not been able to cum. I barely even get hard anymore It's mostly soft and when I get somewhat hard it only lasts for a small amount of time. Every time I think I am getting close to thinking I am going to cum it just doesn't happen. It sucks, because now when I am just chilling I sometimes start shaking a very very tiny amount because I know I need to cum and have so much built up in me but I just can't seem to do it.

I used about 2 grams, one and a half Saturday, all smoked, and about a half gram or so Sunday. They did the blood test Thursday afternoon. I know when they test your piss they are testing for metabolites and work for about a week.

Is the detection time different in blood, and will I most likely pass, or fail? Some stuff online I've found says 1 day, some say 3 days, and other longer. Anyone know without a shadow of a doubt? Been sweating this all weekend.

I've been on subs for like a year now after hitting rock bottom my life is wayyyy better than it was before, but sometimes I do feel a bit lonely because I burned so many bridges and lost so many of my best friends during those dark lost years of using...

Do you think AA could be a good place for me to meet people, and find the sense of community I'm looking for ??? My best friend goes to meetings sometimes when he visits the city from upstate (he used to live in the City), they're AA at a place called Midnite.

They have meetings every day multiple times a day/night and it's close to where I live and apparently a-lot of people who work in our industry go there..... No harm in trying right? I've never done any real meetings NA or AA, one of my DR.s had ""group"" once a month that was mandatory if you were on subs, but they were run by his wife because he and his family were super Christian.

I always thought NA made more sense, but a-lot of the NA meetings in NYC are in like homeless shelters and really shady areas and that doesn't really appeal to me or seem like a positive thing.

Basically a review of my experience so far for anyone curious or considering it,"TLDR - sorry for the damn wall o text!!! Basically I had a lot of really negative ideas about it for a long time and wanted to share a positive experience. 
Keep in mind I am still on methadone maintenance and cannot speak for the experience of tapering or getting off completely... This is me mid-treatment. Thanks :)

First of all, I think it's important to mention that I started out being of the very strong and strict opinion of methadone: fuck that, it's just a substitute, it's just government-funded heroin, etc. At the time, I knew only 2 ppl who had gone from heroin to methadone, and both were self-proclaimed ""lifers"" that continued to be swallowed by their addictions to other substances (particularly things that potentiated their methadone, causing their daily  doses to get them fucked the fuck off) despite leaving heroin behind.

My dad was one of them. He went to methadone after 20+ years of heroin use. We talked a lot over FB and I would tell him all about where I was at in life. I didn't need to sugarcoat things for him. He always ended up bringing up methadone, at first suggesting and over time almost trying to push it on me as a solution. I rejected it, so sure of myself that I wasn't as weak as him, that I would be able to find the peace in sobriety that he couldn't and some day be able to cold turkey kick and never look back. I kept trying, going in and out of state-funded detoxes, signing up for the 30 day programs but always bailing by or before my 2nd week. I would make the tiniest improvements, like getting a job, only to blow it all up in my own face and go on a remorse and self-loathing bender & wake up in a worse place than before. 
 
A little over a year ago, my dad's hardcore lifestyle caught up with him in a major way. His liver was failing and due to his status as an addict, he didn't qualify for a replacement. He wouldn't stop drinking no matter how much it hurt him or what the doctors said. He died in a hospital. I hadn't talked to him in months. I went to his memorial still strung out, around a family I hadn't associated with for as long as I could remember. 

After he died, I started to give the idea of methadone a chance. His death came as a surprise, despite how harshly he had lived. Even though we joked about needing to have a visit ""before one of us dies"", it was never a serious concern of mine. I faced the truth, that methadone may be my last resort, but I was down at that level already. The thought of my life flying past me like my father's had for him, ending in loneliness, regret, and pain was terrifying and now very real. I didn't formally decide to do it ""for him"", but my outlook softened at the thought of taking his advice and it saving me from the painful life he lead. 

Anyway, Heroin wasn't getting me high anymore, not any amount, and the meth/coke/crack/Xanax/whatever-the-fuck I did to fill that hole was tearing me up. My relationship, my health, my self-respect, the little respect anyone had for me... my life in general was deteriorating.  The selling point was when an aquaintance told me ""I can wake up in the morning and CHOOSE whether or not I want to use"". To me, that meant I'd be able to get high if I wanted, but the nightmare of withdrawal would no longer be a problem. So I worked for the money to do intake and pay for a weeks worth of doses, called the closest clinic and did the damn thing. I started at 30mgs.

I kept using daily for about a month and a half. I could still feel it on a lower dose. My boyfriend had not made the switch yet and knowing he was using was way too tempting. As I had been told, the daily dosing waved my sickness away and made me hella drowsy for a week or so. My boyfriend did his intake almost exactly a month after I had, after seeing my improvement as he still suffered. By my 3rd month, I was using maybe once a week or 2. This huge change was settling in on me, like a fog. It was like over time, the idea of shooting dope was becoming less and less appealing. So I would brush it off till I got a really bad craving, then I'd cop and the whole thing would be such a disastrous burden. I got a job on my 3rd month and naturally my paychecks were triggering as shit. But every time I'd give in, I ended up so disappointed that I truly never wanted to do it again...not ""fuck this, I'm kicking tomorrow!"", but ""I don't need this anymore, it doesn't help me, I can feel good without it."" The icing on the cake was my total inability to hit a vein anymore...after so long stabbing and bleeding and missing, only to receive the most dull ""rush"" imaginable IF I did succeed...it was horrible. 

As time has passed, my use has continued to diminish in frequency. I've leveled off at 60mgs per day and if I wanted it, I'd need a much bigger shot than I used to to feel even a little. My use went from daily, to weekly, to monthly, to only on the random occasion of a biting craving intertwined with depression or self loathing... For instance, recently I had an extremely traumatic & triggering life event. I bought a 60 of tar, from which I got no rush, but still woke up with my car stopped in the middle of traffic, and still have a huge painful early-stage abcess on my arm (right on top of my favorite tattoo). That experience was so overwhelmingly infuriating, it left me with only regret. I'm lucky as fuck I didn't go to jail. 

What I didn't expect from methadone that I have been so pleasantly surprised by, is the sense of freedom. Within the first week I felt like my cell door had been unlocked. Not having to wake up sick, or spend the first hour(s) of every day making myself hurt and bleed in search of a vein..no being cornered into trusting scary, violent, or creepy ppl, no putting myself the way of the law or danger out of desperation...

Im not as scared anymore, I don't feel the need to take shit from people or bend over backwards to prove to them that I'm worthy of their decency despite what I am. When I was using, I took the worst shit from people who claimed to care about me because I didn't think I was worthy of anything better. I'm so much more confident in my appearance since I've gone up to a normal weight and my body isn't constantly covered in scabs from picking.

Ppl I meet now would never guess all the fucked up places I've been...not that I'm ashamed of it, but it's nice to be able to choose whether or not I'm going to let someone know that part of my story. I'm learning things about myself I never knew and probably never would have known without the entire experience of addiction, and I can almost truthfully say that I don't regret it. One thing I am positive that I don't regret is my choice to try methadone. It hasn't been a miracle cure, and there never will be such a thing. Methadone helped me achieve more than I ever could have hoped it would, and I have no desire to stay on it forever...but I also have no desire to get off of it anytime soon, because I know I'm not ready. And that's fine. Methadone is by no means doing for me what heroin did & I don't want it to. All it's doing it helping me to take my recovery process at the pace I need to. 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk :p

Back in the day I was using heavy and it first came out. I remember going to one of the first places that opened in Pittsburgh and I think the only one at the time, you had to buy the pills there I was somewhere between 18-22 back then. I remember the nurse asked if I was sick and told her very much, she pulled out an 8mg sub and told me to wait to see Dr. it worked wonders. I wasn‚Äôt sick at all, all my symptoms were gone and I had a mild buzz, I was prescribed 2mg three times a day 
It was very new at the time and I don‚Äôt even think many or any pharmacies carried it I had to drive to his clinic every 2 weeks for the Dr visit and buy the pills there. They worked like Magic regardless if I was talking them daily how I was supposed to or using in between and taking them when I was sick they always worked.  Shortly after another clinic opened which I switched too, I think he was the 2nd in Pittsburgh and one of the few in general, people were driving 5-6 hours every 2 weeks to see him. I switched to him because he only used the 8mg tablets. They too worked wonders usually took them as prescribed and sometimes go on runs and they when I would switch over they always worked perfectly, I left the clinic at once Point and came back years later in 2010 (I am currently 33 now) they had me on the strips which had just came out and I was on those for awhile then I asked to be switched to Subutex because one or two companies made generic for it and they had no generic for suboxone and I had no insurance and it was very expensive for the strips especially when they first came out so they let me switch to subutex so I could get generic and afford it. I eventually got back off it in 2010. Then years later I was on dope again and had 2 strips for backup. Decided to use them one night and ended up taking one and barely getting any relief at all from it. I took the second 8mg strip and it helped a little bit not much more or nearly at all how they used too. Now at the end of 2018/2019 I have a way to get subs occasionally but the dude is rare to let them go, I got initially 6 total but I‚Äôve been trying to come off of a short run of a few weeks. Last week I woke up to go to work and took an 8mg pill and felt sick, I mean it was toned down but all my symptoms were still there so I took another 4mg and basically the same reaction. I tired one more times later that week and got the same results. I took 12mg and my buddy said my pupils were huge and I still had all the withdrawal symptoms they were just toned down a little bit, whereas before they all went away and I even got a slight good feeling from it. Now I‚Äôm reading multiple different opinions from different threads, I have a fast metabolism so I don‚Äôt need to wait 24 hours I can wait 12, which it‚Äôs always been that way for me. I was told to take 2-3 at a time which seems excessive and I don‚Äôt have enough to really do that. I read it takes a few days. Over the last few days on day 1 I took 8mg in the morning and 8mg at night to at least block my receptors to avoid thoughts of dope, and took benzos and Clonidine to help with the withdrawal symptoms that I still have. They are not full blast but more so just toned down by like 25% the second day I took 8mg in the morning and 8mg in evening, the next dayI took 8mg in the morning today and 4mg at night. I was able to acquire more today so now I have 7 to be able to finish this short taper that I am gonna do. I feel like each day as the subs stay in my system they are helping a little more each day but this is nothing what it use to be like back in the day for me. If I was sick I would take a sub and be completely well and feel good slightly off of it. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs different now, the brand names can‚Äôt that much be that much different than generics. I am still gonna keep taking them and lowering the dose. They are helping some and I like my receptors being blocked going through withdrawals to keep the thoughts of using out of my head, so I‚Äôll keep taking them for the next however many days along with Clonidine and the benzos I have. I took Kratom 2 years prior to my slip up which is now about 3 weeks or a little more I lost track. I was doing well on the Kratom I just wanna get over this dope withdrawal and get back to my Kratom regimen. I am just so curious about the suboxone. I feel like it‚Äôs changed a lot and is nothing how it was before. I am doing the same amounts of dope, the only thing different was I was taking brand name back then 85% of the time cause they didn‚Äôt have generics yet. I am still baffled by this and at first I thought they changed the formula, or the generic brands are different, anyway I‚Äôm just gonna keep taking them and hopefully they build up a little and give me relief.
In the past if I was sick one 8mg suboxone would 100% deal with all my symptoms 
Now I feel they deal with them about 25% and am confused, I wouldn‚Äôt have had to take benzos and clonidine before. But I‚Äôm gonna stick to my short taper and not going back to dope. I just didn‚Äôt know if anyone else understands what I am talking about or going through anything seem similar?

Hope everyone is having a good night :) ",1547431824.0

I'm trying to get off dope and I have 1 and a half subs (8mg strips) and 50g of kratom. I can also buy some adderall and more subs and potentially kpins. I'm wondering the best way to utilize all of these. Also I snorted a pack of dope today around 1-2:00 pm, could I take the sub tomorrow morning at around 6 or 7 am?

I was thinking about taking a full 8 mg strip tomorrow morning when I wake up for work, and shooting it. I should either be slightly sick or just a few hours away from sickness. Taking that sub should keep me good till the next morning where I want to take the half sub I have for 4 mgs which I assume will keep me well till the 3rd day. By the 3rd day I want to be off subs since I dont want to get off dope and be forced to take subs so for the 4th day I think id take 15 mg of kratom and a 30 mg adderall and continue that for 4 days by which point I think I'll be off sick.

I don't have a massive tolerance I uses to shoot up a gram and a half 2x a day but I stopped like 2 years ago I just relapsed 5 months ago but when it comes to regular ass opiates like codeine or hydrocodone I need a ridiculous strength to do anything to me (80mg or so) thank christ my tolerance for smack went down (I can get lifted on a half a point now!! Which is a godsend I don't have to spend half of the amount of money I did before to get high/well)


ANYWAYS I'm sorry for that long ass story my question is how does 30mg oxy (oral) compare to H or IV oxycodone? Would I need less or more by that logic I would say I get high off on 60mg of H (black tar given my geographical location)

Can I redose orally and or intranasally until desired effect? Let's say if I snort more every hour or so?

I've heard you can redose orally like this with DHC (Dihydrocodeine). Poping them whenever until desired effect. Is this true?

Of course I decided I wanted to get something since I had a shitty day. I've only known this plug a few months but we've become really close. I even have his extra phone number that only 3 or 4 people have. His girlfriend is young amd psycho jealous but we actually get along which he says is amazing since I'm his only female customer that she can stand. We talk from time to time as I have her number also. So I called him on xmas night around 9 and he told me to come to his hotel room but I'd have to wait for his plug but it wouldn't be long. Honestly I didnt care I was just sick of being alone and my son fell asleep and didn't want to be around my husband. When I called he seemed a bit upset and I asked him what was wrong. He was upset that this is his first xmas in 14 years out of prison and he spoiled his gf and always hooks everyone up and no one got him anything or even wished him a merry xmas. I'm a witch so I don't celebrate but I told him that I didn't get anything either and was alone all day. He was upset to find out I had been by myself and didnt call because he wouldve picked me up so I wasn't alone. On my way I had to stop at walgreens to get cash out and only had like $10 extra bucks so I got him one of the few remaining xmas cards($6!!!) And a bag of candy. I wrote him a nice and short note and was on my way. He answered the door and almost cried when he read the card. Most people just see their plugs as dope boys but I always have atleast 4 or 5 and always become close with them. Dont forget that they are people too!

I came outside and jumped in the car and he was with his girlfriend. He said to look to my left and it was a wrapped gift. He got me a super nice puma zip up! I almost started crying. He said what I did meant so much to him and he's been meaning to return the favor but has been busy. The price tag said $60. Like damn. Kind of sad my dope man got my something and no one else did.

Only true survivalist can last long. Some people are better at than others. Of all the junkies ive encountered that were really good at it, the one thing they had in common is that they were willing to hustle. And they always had some kind of unconventional way of procuring their drugs.

So I was hoping we could have a thread where we can share our tricks and unconventional ways of getting our drugs or drug money. No need for obvious shit like stealing or wiggin up and slangin' that boyhole. That shits for the slowest of the herd.

Ill start....Dumpster Diving...yep. It can net you both money and drugs. Money by selling unused items you find thrown out. Drugs by unused drugs you find thrown out. Ill get a little more in depth.

I would always dumpster dive pharmacies. My state and city in particular has a lot of pill mill pharmacy that sell nothing but narcotics. Some of things ive found here are lots of broken pills that get thrown out. These are normally xanax bars and dillies. My biggest score to date im sure pissed someone off. 5 30ct bottles of dillies and a 500ct bottle of bars all unopened. Someone on the inside Definatly sent them out with the trash to retrieve later, but i got there first.
At big chain pharmacies my finds were often some hydrocodone cough syrup. But not normally any thing real good. 

Another thing to look for is always empty bottles of xanax. They come in 500 ct bottles. And they are kind of talcy. You often find a lot of loose powder at the bottom. 2 or 3 of those will get you fucked up.

Its some junkie shit to do for sure. This is only for a commited mfer who is gonna get high one way or the other.",1547417463.0

It's soul-crushing, not just the haunting memories of what I have done to hurt those around me, but what may potentially await me in the future that could be out of my control. I'm tired of living in a constant panic of whether or not I'm going to not wake up one morning and leave my loving parents, my wonderful younger brother, my beautiful girlfriend, and my supportive, great friends to a life of heart-wrenching agony. The thought of having to potentially witness that horror beyond the afterlife aches my mind and soul to a magnitude of no other, so I've decided to finally take action in an attempt to put an end to it. I want to be able to live again, and feel happy without the weight of a substance bringing me down. I want to progress in life, and live to be the best me I can be. I want to grow old and be married with the precious, beautiful woman I've been lucky to call mine for the past year and a half. I want my family to be proud of me again, and to never have to worry about checking my pulse while I'm asleep at 4 AM. I want to be able to see a bottle of pills without instantly having the subconscious reflex to take it. I want all of this out of my life. Last night, I finished the last of an order of 26 blues, the ones that will hopefully be my last. If I'm being honest, I'm scared. I'm terrified of leaving behind what feels like my one and only true key to unconditional happiness and contentment in the world, the one thing that seems to prevent life from becoming dull and monotonous, but I know that's just the addiction speaking and I can only hope that it will get easier to deal with as time goes on. Any kind words of love and support are welcomed and appreciated to every extent. It will be difficult, probably the hardest thing I'll ever do. But I owe this to myself. I owe this to my family, and I owe this to every person in my life who has been there to love and support me. I'm hoping I will have the power to overcome this and never look back, through every fiber of my ability. I hope this message goes out to all of you that may be in a similar situation, I have every hope this will bring you some sense of empowerment or faith, and a sense of unity in not being alone. I believe in all of you wonderful people in the same manner I hope you would all believe in me. I am better than this, we all are. Greatness awaits.",1547386262.0

With that out of the way I need some honest opinions. I had a pretty bad oxy dependence in the past (roughly 80-120 mg daily) which i know to some of you is a minor habit but it was pretty life destroying for me. 

Well I‚Äôve been clean for six months and I don‚Äôt ever want to use everyday or even every week/month for that matter. I know I have the willpower to stay clean because I have over 600 oxy 10/325‚Äôs in my possession and I‚Äôve had them since day 1 of my sobriety and haven‚Äôt touched them once! 

If I use one time at like 30mg will this restart withdrawals or PAWS? Ideally I‚Äôd like to use every six months or so but if I‚Äôm gonna wake up the next day sick or wake up the next day with a horrible bout of PAWS then I may as well throw out all my oxy because it‚Äôs not worth it.

Anyways to keeps this short, after several attempts of getting clean and relapsing the past couple years, my urge to finally end all this bullshit is at the highest it‚Äôs ever been and I believe I must get clean this time and want to finally start living my fucking life again. My current tolerance is a gram a day of some really strong China White fent IV. 
 
So basically I‚Äôve gotten successfully clean a couple times using rapid suboxone tapers the past couple years but this time I‚Äôm considering going cold turkey just to be done with all the bullshit seeing as you still have to w/d from subs still, as it only lengthens the w/d time while minimizing the symptoms, which is still awesome I think subs are an amazing tool for helping us addicts manage our lives and useful for getting clean completely. 

My arsenal of comfort meds include roughly 30 2mg Xanax bars, 35 300mg gabapentin, 4 grams of bud, random amounts of clonidine, methocarbamol, and hydroxyzine (all except the weed prescribed by my addiction doc). Also have a steady supply of old sub scripts incase I do decide to get on them. All of which I know I‚Äôm very blessed to have, as this is the first time I‚Äôve gone through wd with such a nice amount of meds. 

So what do you guys think? Should I just use my meds to go cold turkey and tough it out for maybe 4-5 days until the withdrawals are over or just use the subs to withdraw somewhat more comfortably over the course of 10-14 days instead?  Any input is very much appreciated. Thank you all in advance, much love to my bropiates! 

TL/DR: Coming off a gram of china fent IV a day, should I use my generous amounts of comfort meds to just go cold turkey or just save the unnecessary hassle of extreme w/d pains by just doing a sub taper instead of just trying to get the wds over with.

He went through addiction, got off, and then started again over Christmas. His girlfriend was supposed to stay off of h too, but she went home for Christmas where the white is, and just lost it. So when she came back, he stopped using, and so did she. So we thought.  Neither of them have cars, and me and my d-boy are like family, so I would usually be the one to help with rides. I picked his girl up from work, and before I left he told me to not give her any of my dope. Okay cool no prob. I don't want to share anyways. But as soon as she got into my car, she hopped into my back seat and pulled out her own stash. She's a grown woman, she to make her own decisions. But I wasn't gonna tell my d-boy, that's between them. She was supposed to give me cash for all the rides and I just told her to give the cash straight to my dboy and him give me dope. The next day when I was working he called me asking why his girl called him saying that he owed me more than he gave me. He was literally yelling, wouldn't stop, so I finally said ""she asked me for a .20, and I told her no bc you only gave me a 30, so she wanted you to add to the bag so she could get some.""
Then he called later asking if I knew what happened to his money bag. No, I don't. He either lost it or someone grabbed it. Then I asked if I could stop by after work and he said yes. So I came to his apartment and he wasn't there but his roommates were so I bought off his roommates. When he finally came home, he was pissed. Screaming at the top of his lungs I was girlfriend asking her why she won't fucking stop heroin, told her she's just a junkie and she ain't worth anything, and then he saw me. Said I was a fucking stupid ass bitch, said he was gonna fuck me up (keep in mind I'm a female), and tried to come at me, and was just throwing out all kinda insults. I have no idea what I did. Fast forward to today at work. I opened my passenger door, and guess what was stuck between the seats? His money bag with 140 bucks. So that shit is mine, fuck him.

But during this whole time, I believe I tapered myself off blues and I‚Äôll explain why. I think the dope was so weak but just good enough to stop any kind of sickness but nothing strong (most likely the blues were probably stronger, they had to be). So I did ZERO blues for like 3 months and just used the D. So I run out of D and of course start panicking that the withdrawals are gonna set in in due time. 4 days later and I feel totally fine. No withdrawals set in at all. My question is if this is even possible? Did I really taper myself off blues with weak D? Maybe I was just satisfying the sniffing cessation fix I have (I just have or had this obsession of sniffing things and feeling the drip). So to my fellow bropiaters, does this make sense at all? I had this panic/anxiety just waiting and waiting for the withdrawals to start but they just never did and today is day 5. During my blue years, I would crave blues so hard and would do anything to get them. Now I don‚Äôt even think about them or crave them at all. All in all, is this even possible what happened to me?

I detoxed in the back room of Carlos‚Äôs house. It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless. A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse. It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me. The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn‚Äôt there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.

The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones‚Äô hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain‚Äôs synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos‚Äôs back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard‚Äôs hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark.

Occasionally at nighttime, I take Tramadol 50mg x2,  another x2 four hours later in the night. 

This has the desired effect and stops me from sleeping, I feel great euphoria and sets me up for an amazing and constructive morning. I am always so happy and buzzing as a result.

However, I always wake the following day with symptoms of a severe hangover (headache, fatigue, a general mess) which decrease in intensity across several days. 

I understand this could be due to Tramadol‚Äôs SSRI properties as I do not have this experience with Codeine, however the recreational value is of less favour to me.

Please could someone tell me whether this is normal? Also what I could take to counteract this ‚Äúhangover‚Äù? I have Diazepam, Lorazepam, Clonazepam and Codeine but unsure if they would help ease the symptoms or prolong them

Sometimes I banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. There was no point in writing, then. Sometimes I stayed in bed and watched the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Tom caused me.

I forgot I had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn‚Äôt make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in a parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a New Mexican Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lie down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Tom‚Äôs, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left Serio outside of Smith‚Äôs grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith‚Äôs was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Turtle Tom‚Äôs the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can‚Äôt remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it. I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Another local drug addict took Serio from me. Of course, he was better than I was and accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and all that I touched.",1547342925.0

That he couldn‚Äôt come in the back door.

Turtle said he once woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in NY state had told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives.  These were the stories he told me.

One day he watched our friend‚Äôs girlfriend open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed he was gone, but Tom watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Tom slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was New Mexico when I knew it.

Everyone probably knows that after snorting its best to use a nasal cleaning spray or a nasal irrigation neti pot product to get the stuff out, but if you have any additional tips regarding nasal hygiene let us know in this thread.

I personally came up with an idea that i think could be helpful in avoiding talc buildup in lungs aka pulmonary talcosis ( there is medical documentation of this happening to pill snorters)

&#x200B;

When youve crushed the oxycontin pill and made it into fine power; put a tiny bit of sterile water to your line and rub it around to make it more moist to eliminate the possibility of the talc getting airborn. Ive been doing this and personally i dont notice it affecting the potency. Simple but mandatory i believe. If someone has even better idea to combat this let me know.

Since then, I've struggled with relapses and short drug runs. My longest time ""clean"" since my 90 Days from November - February 2018 was 65 over summer.

**Today I can safely say I am legitimately 90 days clean.** 

I am also excited because I get to pick up a 90-day chip and I've never gotten that one before. From November - February 2018 - I white-knuckled it. So, I'm also excited about getting a 90-day chip. I'll likely pick it up tomorrow though. Even though it'd be neat to get it on the exact day, getting to a meeting today seems a bit difficult.

# Also, may I say a few words about Narcotics Anonymous?

***No? Okay, thanks, I will anyway...***

I used to shit on that program so much. I used to hate it and think everyone there was a delusional brainwashed religious nut job who took everything to the extreme. After getting involved in it, I discovered it is actually a super useful program that provided me with a new way of looking at life. I was stunned by how much fun the fellowship of NA is and am super lucky to have a strong fellowship where I live.

As for the religious side of NA here is a little summary of what NA really is when it comes to your higher power or religious beliefs: [https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/5V6xKnJ.jpg)

For instance, for me, my ""higher power"" is this concept that you get back what you put out into the world. If you put a lot of good in - you'll ultimately get good back. I take negative experiences as, ""not as bad as I think they are"" and ""a learning experience,"" it really helps me cope with day to day life and so much higher power is simply the idea that I am not in control of what happens, but I am capable of making good & healthy decisions.

# 90 days is a lot but at the same time, it isn't!

Let's see, in the last 90 days, my life has changed dramatically...

* I got Engaged
* I moved into a larger 1 Bedroom for cheaper than my studio! Say WAT?!
* I've gained a lot of my Family's trust back in me
* My average number of ER visits is rapidly on the decline
* I'm learning alternative measures to my pain problems
* I'm starting my own website/online business entity
* I finished Step #1 & admitted to being an addict
* & I bought a whole bunch of nice furniture for my new place, because I could afford i

That's a lot of chance imho for 90 days!

Coming off a 2 bun a day habit, (2 grams of ecp daily) I figured 24 hours was enough time to wait. I was feeling mild withdrawal at that point, but I figured 24 hours was enough. I split the suboxone strip into 4 2mg pieces, and used one.

45m later, I was launched into Precipitated WithDrawal HELL.

I started kicking uncontrollably. Yawning about 2 times a minute. My eyes were HUGE, and they were runny as hell. Hot water tears were pouring out of my eyes. My stomach started cramping. Chills. Everything. The worst withdrawal ever x 100,000.

My H dealer wasn‚Äôt around until Sunday, so from 4 pm Saturday up until 12 pm Sunday, I was in legit hell. I wanted to kill myself, that‚Äôs how bad it was. I didn‚Äôt sleep a lick all night, just kicked, yawned, and screamed from time to time. It was insanity.

I rolled out of bed and drove to my dealer, hadn‚Äôt showered, hair a mess, still in my pajamas, smelling like shit. I didn‚Äôt care. I couldn‚Äôt do anything and I was on the brink of suicide (not really, but it was bad. BAD.)

I finally got the H in my hands, nose runny and everything and furiously opened the bags and snorted a bunch. Within 2 minutes, I fucking started vomiting. 3 times, all over my passenger seat car. I started sweating like crazy too and basically. Started fucking crying. 10 minutes later, I started feeling better and within an hour and a bunch more bags I was basically ok.

What the fuck? How can I ever get off this drug if that‚Äôs what happens when I stop or try to use suboxone? I couldn‚Äôt wait more than 24 hours, I was feeling anxiety and like shit so I used it and it almost killed me. I was so scared of withdrawal on Sunday that I made sure I used every day this week up until now.

I scored a bunch of Tylenol #3‚Äôs and Kratom. I‚Äôm planning to use clonidine, Kratom and the codeine tablets to detox. I researched but didn‚Äôt find anything about using codeine to taper off H. Does anyone have any experience with this? Do you think it‚Äôs a good combo?

I guess the point of this post is to ask about the Tylenol #3 detox idea and to warn everyone about PWD. Don‚Äôt fucking do it. If I had a gun, I might have offed myself. It was that bad. I kept kicking my legs all night and just couldn‚Äôt stop. I screamed at the top of my lungs a bunch of times because of how bad it felt. Lesson learned. I‚Äôm never touching suboxone ever ever ever again, and if I do, it‚Äôs damn sure going to be 48-72 hours after my last use.",1547321991.0

When I do return, I want to be safe. Just a tolerance drop/ harm reduction question","I‚Äôve been on and off with oxy and hydros for 5 years. 

So I go on binges that last anywhere from 3-6 months, I build quite a tolerance... then I somehow manage to stop..I do remember that every time I returned my tolerance was always decreased. But I just can‚Äôt for the life of me remember the exact specifics

For example, my most recent binge started August of 2018 and ended January 3 2019.

First day, It took me just 50 mg of Hydrocodone to nod. Last day it had climbed to 100 mg oxy..


Before that, my last binge was January 2017 and I was at 100 mg oxy... so a year and a half break dropped my tolerance to 50 mg hydrocodone (or one blue 30 approx)


Fast forward to now, my tolerance is at 100 mg Oxycodone  yet again  But I am not planning on quitting for a year and a half like last time...

I‚Äôm only gna stop for 3 months. So when I do return from this 3 month break, how much would be a safe dose ? 100 mg would be overkill, right ? 

I‚Äôm guessing 45 mg would be ideal? What do y‚Äôall think.

You know how pushy these motherfuckers are & I honestly was ready to take a loss just to get him to leave me alone and let me enjoy my buzz. So, In order to get the # of subs college guy wanted id have to do a buncha bullshit at my sub dr.. go to the pharmacy etc.. literally everything I absolutely didn't feel like doing on a Saturday when I'm high relaxed as fuck chillin - so I said fuck it (I had 3 subs on me - buddy wanted 10) and just decided to buy the other 7 off my dealer. Hes greedy and would not let them go for less than $20 each. Anyway, so I buy 7 subs from him, and he starts shaking them out into my Pill Bottle... And god damn.. I can clearly see he's fucking up and putting Opana 40s in my Bottle ($120 each) instead of suboxone... I was like oh my god.. I said thanks and got the fuck outta there. I got down the street and turned around to return them because I genuinely like this guy, but the junkie in me just couldn't force myself to make the turn onto his street..

Now im just sitting here with 7 Opana 40s waiting on his text saying bring my motherfucking pills back.. Nothing yet.. It's been about 30mins.. I don't know what to do. I haven't done any yet.. What would you do? fml I hate him putting me in this position.

Update 4 those interested: 

24 hours later nothing..
Shortly after I posted on Reddit yesterday I decided to take a road trip and I drove a couple hours to visit my mom and my dog because I rarely have enough pills to last me long enough to have an enjoyable visit. Every time I go to visit her I'm rushing out the next morning sick af with a wad of cash going a hundred miles an hour back to my city to the dope man..

Haven't heard a peep from him or any of his little junky girlfriends who make every bit of his pills and his money their business... they try to use him  but he's an old white man,pussy Slayer type from way back... type of old white man you can't kill.   smoking crack riding Harleys getting shot catering around buckham $30,000 cash dealing with black thugs that's just in the last couple of months this old motherfukers done all that..  he knows exactly what he's doing  definitely  the Patriarchs of  our City's dope scene ..
His silence is almost more disconcerting than being cussed out. I'm going to try to buy more pills today like nothing happened but I'm kind of nervous to even talk to him.",1547321380.0

The start of the spiral that wound me up a homeless h addict,"She was lying to me. Bold faced. She knew it and I knew it, even her mom's little yappy fucking dog knew it. What the dog didnt know was the rules of engagement in the war of lies our relationship had become. I couldn't just call her out without proof. Overwhelming evidence really, but I was ready. Or so i thought.

""You're using again."" I said plainly and without emotion.

""No I am really really not."" She replied a little too quickly.

""I found a rig in the car, your arms have tracks and you're pupils are pinned. Dont lie to me. I can handle it if you've relapsed but I cant handle being lied to by my significant other. As someone who was shooting dope long before you ate your first lortab I know the signs. I have never once been angry or even disappointed in someone to hear they're off the wagon. It's as regular a part of life to me as someone saying they have a headache or something."" I said honestly. I didnt want to fight about it. Truthfully a big part of me just wanted her to admit it and break me out a damn shot also. 

She continued to lie but I knew it was bullshit. I should have let it go and and acted like stuff was cool and made plans to leave and followed through on them but I was younger and dumber then and I let being right get to my head without thinking of consequences. A mistake I've made over and over in my life.

""Fine. If you aren't using then take this and never let me hear the end of how right you are."" I said as I pulled out a suboxone she didnt know I got at the methadone clinic that morning. I was on 180 fucking mg of methadone a day. It would've been a much better position to throw that in my face rather than deny use in my opinion. 

"" . . . . . . .""
"" . . . . . . . I""
"" . .I am not fucking using and I dont want that fucking sub! Why cant you trust me?!"" She said, along with blah blah blah more of the same. Then she said she was taking the kids (hers not mine but I'd been their father figure for over 5 years) to an appointment to have their pictures made. She wasnt even angry. Said she loved me very much and we could talk more when she got back and asked if I needed anything while she was out. That was a pro move. I was outclassed. About 25 minutes later the police arrived for me. 

Her mom knew I'd been selling some shit. I thought that had something to do with it. I had been being pretty good though. I didnt know my fiance completely betrayed me. She was not a good person to have turn against you because she couldn't just stab someone in the back a little, ever so gently and mercifully. She would go all out and try to destroy someone 100% so you couldn't come back at her. That reptilian mercilessness is still somewhat impressive to me. I dont have it. 

It was Friday. I had Saturday and Sundays take home doses of my methadone. I took them both while I watched the police walking up to the door from our bedroom on the second floor. I thought to myself ""360mg on top of the 180 I had a few hours ago might be a deadly mistake."" then I thought ""you'll be extra high in holding in the jail and if you die it really wouldn't be too tragic. Nothing of value lost really."" I know that's a fucked way of thinking and I've climbed out of it since but I felt that way for many years. I proceeded to make sure the very little illegal shit I had was well hidden and proceeded to face the music. 



Pt 2 coming later. Maybe. 

How has everyone's holidays been? I haven't posted any stories lately so I thought I'd throw one out there. This was waay back when I was on methadone (obviously) sorry if it's not as crazy as my normal posts if that's what you're into. I've been trying to work on things so I didnt want to post stories about my homeless gutter junkie street rat life because I'm not in that mode right now. Thankfully. My best friend, explaining this to another girl I know on video chat with me said ""oh yea he gets clean for short periods ever so often"" so dont be horrified if I'm back on the streets getting high again but I'm currently trying not to with the help of a really good friend. I have even left my home state and moved somewhere new. Ty to all the people who have messaged me and have shown concern and positive energy. You guys help more than you know.

1. Is there a difference between OxyContin and Oxycodone (or is OxyContin just a brand name of a type of Oxycodone?), additionally the same question about Roxicodone.
1. How does Dilaudid compare to Oxycodone mg to mg? Does an 8mg Dilaudid have the same/similar high to a 20mg or 30mg Oxycodone?
1. I remember a long time ago when I would smoke OxyContin pills I would have to wash off the coating with a damp paper towel, if I plan to snort these pills do I need to do anything special with them like I did for smoking them?
1. Do people really stuff things up their bum? No judgement, just hard to tell if it's hilarious sarcasm or people are really getting high this route, also is there a benefit/downside?
1. Lastly the big question; I recently came into a mixed plethora of pills (~200) of 10's, 15's, 20's, 30's, 40's, 60's, 80's of OxyContin/Oxycodone/Roxicodone (again not sure the differences) as well as 4mg/8mg Dilaudid. More than half of them are 30's and 40's though. My main question being, what is the best way to consume these that does not consist of using needles?

I smoke BTH. I chose it as my DOC and am an open opiate user using once per month. My history of opiate drugs includes Heroin, Oxycodone, Buprenorphine, Hydrocodone, Morphine and even Opium. I am not opposed to IV use. I know how to IV and have the necessary gear and am a stickler when it comes to hygiene, technique and moderating personal use.

My tolerance is always ""Opiate Naive"" whenever I use. Before going with the BTH, 15mg Oxycodone insuffulated would have me feeling nicely euphoric and content. No where near nodding though and let alone rushing. Just happy and high.

My questions are now as follows:

1. Recommended dose. I believe for me IV 1-4mg. I have read a few occasions of the rush being so intense that it was mentioned they felt as if they've OD'ed while being consciously aware and in a state of extreme euphoria after the initial rush that triggered this feeling. That sounds really good. IV Dope came close to doing this a few times but those thoughts subsided within seconds. Is it more intense than that?

2. Could this overthrow BTH as my DOC? Or is it an exotic indulgence that won't replace the tried and true? I've been fetishizing Hydromorphone for a few months now and would be quite disappointed if it let's me down.

3. How does a Oxy/Dilly combo sound? Many refer to it as yet another hillbilly heroin variation. I am not a fan of combining drugs. The reason why I suggested it is because I am worried that while the rush will tickle an old fancy of mine, the short legs will leave me feeling unsatisfied.

Sorry for writing so much blah blah, I'm just excited to try this new substance and haven't had an IV rush in a long time.",1547295725.0

For everyone who has got clean off opiates and comes across the thought of just having one night to bring back old memories and have a good times thinking your strong enough to just do it once more, you are not. You may think one time after being sober for months or years wont put you back into active addiction you are dead wrong. Opiates are so much stronger than how strong minded you think you are about being able to just do it once and stop again and that is a fact.

The reason I say this is I have been using for 8 years... April 2016 I got pulled over for driving under suspension and ended up not paying my ticket since I rather get high and finally got picked up on a bench warrant. Since it was my first time I ended up doing 30 days in county which I got sober and needed nothing which was nice for once. Unfortunately 30 days didnt do it for me and the night I got released I was at the connects getting high again and it went back to every day again.

May 2017 once again I ended up getting pulled over for driving under suspension, no insurance etc. which racked up tickets to an amount over $2000. From my addiction I had lost everything from the time I got released from jail the first time and once again had no way of paying my tickets due to chasing the high. I ended up going to court and got sentenced to 90 days. Out of the 90 days I believe I served 64-66 days total and in that time I got completely sober again. 

After that 64-66 days I felt the best I had ever felt within the past 8 years from addiction. When I was released I had it in my mind that i wasn't going to pick it up again and fall back off into addiction. All I did when I got out was smoke a little weed until about 3 weeks after release (almost 3 months clean). 

After 3 months of being clean my fiancee who slowed down but never really stopped like promised since I was getting clean in jail asked if we could buy just 1 yes just 1 Roxy 20mg so I said yes but only this one since I felt like I wasn't weak minded anymore and I could just do 1. My tolerance had dropped in the 3 months and after I smoked half of the 20mg Roxy within 30 minutes ended up having a seizure waking up with EMS around me.

Even after coming close to fucking myself up for the rest of my life or worse dying this didnt stop me. I thought I was still strong minded after this and that hey 1-2 on pay day once a month wouldnt hurt anything and wouldn't put me back to square one. That half of a 20mg Roxy started the addiction again and one turned into 1-2 once a month which turned into every payday that turned into back to being in active addiction once again doing them every day and always hunting for something so that I won't be sick when I wake up, during the day, or at night when im calling it a night.

At this point I guess a may be a little better off or maybe the same... 2016 and 2017 I had a vehicle but was living in hotels since I couldn't save money to rent a home. Now once in active addiction again its completely opposite. I had saved enough while starting into active addiction again that I was able to rent my own home again but now I don't have a vehicle. Had some problems come up and the vehicle my fiancee and myself screwes up and after paying my bills and getting our fix every day we do not have money to get another car. We have been without a car since mid October and have been waiting on tax season to get a reliable vehicle again.

I am sorry this was so long but I just spent over 30 minutes writing this in hopes of if anything just saving one of you from going back into active addiction after spending all that time getting clean and healthy and reprogramming your brain into being a normal person again after you spent countless hours that turned into months or years chasing the high, screwing up relationships with your family, taking away your freedom for periods of time, fucking up your body to points it can't be reversed or worse death... 

Please for those who are sober stay sober and don't think that your mind is stronger than the opiates because the fact is if you are even thinking about doing it one more time and you will be able to say ""hey ok that's it for me"" then your mentally not strong enough. You will know when you are mentally strong enough when you get offered that substance and you decline or the thought of doing them again never crosses your mind again.

If this post saves just 1 redditor from relapsing then this post was a complete success in my eyes... I hope it saves more than just 1 person but as an addict I know it takes one baby step at a time.",1547285330.0

I bought a fent strip test over the internet, asked my guy for some H, he didn't have but he know someone who had it, after 2 days he came throught and handle me a small bag of ""China White"" and said it was the most stronger shit he have ever seen, after that I went to multiples pharmacys to buy a needle but they all refuse to sell it to me (even went to buy with a d.a.r.e. shirt) so fuck it, im going to snort the whole bag, being a person wjo never did any opiates this should kill me. I opened the bag and tested for fentanyl and was a positive, I felt so fucking happy because I was sure I was going to die, after I snorted the whole bag I went to smoke my last cig and... I woke up with my brother in law carrying me to the couch, I snorted at 2:30AM and he found me 7:30AM, he said my lips were blue and I was so cold (I live in south florida and was the coldest night of the season, was 41¬∞f) He covered me with some blankets and I fell asleep again, I woke up multiples times and threw up a LOT, when was 4PM I was fully awake and my sister asked me what happend and I said I bought some coke from a guy and don't know what happened.

This will be a bit of an extreme rant and some of you may not agree and that is completely fine but the way I see things is that the posts, that usually go along the lines of ‚ÄúI found .... what is this? Is ... a junkie?‚Äù need to desperately stop. If you have a hunch about someone using there is no better option imo than to ask them nicely. At the end of the day none of us here can identify anything with completely certainty. And if you are to go off our opinions and thoughts (because that is what they just are) I do not see how it will end anyway but badly. 

Particularly to all you parents and partners of potential users, you need to understand there is a way to approach someone about this. We don‚Äôt know who you are and anyone else in your life and we sure as fuck don‚Äôt know your situation and story. Remember that a person will only accept help when they want it and they will only stop using when they are ready to. Any forceful approach, in my experience, only led me to disappearing for weeks and using with a ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô mentality that led me to the ER room countless times. 

I‚Äôm sorry but I personally can not stand these stupid fucking posts. We addicts are typically sensitive and temperamental people that think and act very differently to non-addicts, especially those of us who are criminally minded by nature too. So please keep that shit out of here because it honestly serves no positive purpose at all. We don‚Äôt hold all the answers in the world. All I, or anyone can do for this matter, is speak on my own experiences and opinions. I know for a fact that if majority of you who post these things approached me they way I have seen you do/say things it would not go pretty. Especially if it was about something like fucking grain of sand on the floor behind the bed or some random plastic. 

Anyway do as you please rant over. Just at least be very careful, calm and understanding and at the end of it HELPFUL. An interrogation, lecture or demands is gonna get you no where fast.

My question (that I'm getting conflicting answers for) is if Dilaudid will pop your standard five panel urine test.

Never thought I would be able to say that.,"Deleted my old account I use to use here awhile back. January 10th last year I had my bond revoked while out on house arrest. I had so many warrants in other counties, violated probation in 2 counties, my kids were in dcf custody, my wife and I were in an extended stay motel, I had no job, and basically everything had turned to shit. 

So January 10th I got high as hell for the last time and turned myself in. I did 30 days in jail followed by 90 days in a work release type program. That was what really helped me get on my feet. I got a job and got into a program to get certified to work as a welder. I got out in April and right after that was put on 90 days house arrest for the probation violation in another county. 

I kept trucking and just fought all the urges I had to use. Which seemed like a lot for the first 6 months. In August my wife and I became a home owner and the following month got custody of our boys back. I‚Äôve been working as a welder for awhile now and my wife recently got a new job working in HR for the first time. 

It‚Äôs strange having money in the bank, doing things as a family, and not having to look over my shoulder worrying when I‚Äôm going to get taken in on my warrants. For so long it seemed like there was no end in sight and I was just waiting to overdose. It‚Äôs been a long road and after so many attempts and relapses I really feel like I‚Äôve made it. I have 6 days left on probation and that‚Äôs it. All my legal problems are behind me. 

I gotta say though what made it different this time was both my wife and I were so ready to get clean and get our life back after so many years ruining it. We actually wanted it. I still read this sub every day for motivation to stay clean. I love seeing all the posts of people here posting how long they have been clean and all the advice people have for those attempting to get clean. Love you guys!

Water and a high fiber diet. This is best in the long run, but it takes time. Also this is the safest and may push you to kicking for good. 

Gentle laxatives like Metamucil and Exlax. This is second best and safe, but it does not always work and relief is not immediate. 

Harsh laxatives like FLEET and magnesium citrate.  These must only be used infrequently since they are not 100% safe but they work in minutes. The purge is violent but the relief is worth. 

WDs.  I promise you that WDs WILL CLEAN YOU OUT.  You'll also save money, but the sickness is... well you know.  Again the sickness may push you to kicking for good.

So I worked till about 12am with a buddy we got a few bags of ecp sniffed while working I was fine, seemed clean no fetty, Just a little fucked up, no nods or anything just felt decent. I got home took 1mg Xanax and sniffed one more small line. Was watching tv for about an hour. Then had to pee. Now when I do D it takes me forever to piss. So I sat on the toilet pushing on my stomach, and the wall is very close to the toilet, like in front of your face. So I leaned my head against it while pushing on bladder to pee. Well I eventually fell asleep. I woke up, legs obv pins and needles, numb, and toenails especially on left side turned purple but I was on the toilet so the position cut off circulation. I then realized the time being 645am and found out I was sleeping on the toilet for about 4 hours give or take 30 min. My face and lips had color some pins and needles in arms and hands but like I said the position I was in wouldn‚Äôt be very comfortable while awake. I think my limbs fell asleep from the position, but at the same time a bit scared I was close to an OD but again I felt fine before going to bathroom. And was atleast an hour since I dosed last before I went to toilet. Could this have been an OD or just fell asleep. Also another important fact, I worked very late last night as well got like 2 hours sleep max and getting a bit sick (like a cold not dope sick) so when I got home tonight I fell asleep for an hour as soon as I sat down before I even showered or took that last small dose with the Xanax. So being so tired is why I think I fell asleep on toilet but very well may have been close to an OD, but again just think was the weird position I fell asleep in. My face had color and lips were red just my toenails purple but again if you think of the position I was in that makes sense. Just scared me a bit and wondering your guys thoughts. I‚Äôm quite new to D but have a decently high tolerance to oxy, about 120mg to feel decent. And I dosed tonight just a couple lines through the night and again never got too fucked up. No nods, just actually tired due to lack of sleep the night before. Wondering what you guys think. I also have a natural tolerance to Xanax, I can take 6 Mgs by itself and does nothing, might knock me out eventually but nothing much else, but every time I mix .5-1mg with say 100mg oxy i normally  end up falling asleep if I‚Äôm not up and moving around. Thanks guys just a scare on my part since I‚Äôm a bit new to D, I also took more D last night with that same 1mg and was fine. Again just looking for some opinions on if it was sleep or close to the deep sleep? Either way scared me after I realized how long I was in there.

Two years later got in terrible wreck fractured spine knee surgery whole nine yards. Was getting so much oxy that got out of control by the end of that year. Oxys were too expensive when my script was over so along cake heroin. Was doing iv speedballs every day. In November last year I didn‚Äôt go to family thanksgiving. (They know I use but not like how much I was using). They called me didn‚Äôt answer for two-three days which is rare for me. I lost my phone and didn‚Äôt care to tell them as I was shooting all day long. They thought I died or was missing so police got involved I figured all this out and admitted I had a big problem. Rehab was great but cravings like mother fucker. My plug who I‚Äôm close with had some A1 coke and of course I indulged the past two days. No heroin as I‚Äôm on suboxone. 

Here‚Äôs my question. (Sorry for all the previous ramble but I felt like I should give you guys a minor background story, now on the question). 
How do you guys that are sober I know there are some in here. Handle a relapse? 
In rehab they told me to be honest and if you relapse you can go back for 30 days again. 
I feel like that‚Äôs a money making scheme. So what have you guys done when you relapsed?",1547187845.0

I have a bunch of subs I've been holding on to for when I'm ready to quit. I've been circling that drain for quite some time now and in the process have opened and partially used a few strips. 

Here is the issue:

All are expired as of 01/2018. Pharmaceuticals are usually good way past their expiration date so I'm not too worried about that

The main issue is the ones that have been opened. They were not protected very well from exposure to air. Do you think they've degraded or become less effective? I want to use them to attempt the Bernese method, I've taken up to 0.5mg at a time with no ill effects or signs of pwd. Not sure if it's just due to the low dose, or the subs are just useless now.


Ideas? Thoughts? Tips on the Bernese method?

I legitimately have no clue where they are, and I don‚Äôt misuse my Zubsolv because ew, lol. 

So my friend whom I‚Äôve known since elementary school and was best friends with in middle and high school, uses heroin. She‚Äôs been using for about 4 1/2 years, but obviously when I was using she wasn‚Äôt a big priority because if someone‚Äôs using they‚Äôre using. You can‚Äôt just magically make them not use, so we rarely talked. 

Since I‚Äôve been sober for the past two months, I‚Äôve been talking to her more just to try to support her and really, to show her how nice it is to be sober. I‚Äôve been trying to support her, we hung out last week and I sparked her up on a blunt, that type of thing. So since I have no Zubsolv and I‚Äôm going to a concert with my mom this Saturday and I don‚Äôt want to be withdrawaling for it, I asked my girl, ‚ÄòI‚Äô, we‚Äôll call her, if she could give me a few of her Suboxone so I could make it. 

Well holy fucking shit. I‚Äôm not going to say it was like pulling teeth, but I had and have to essentially beg this bitch to let me get some. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs saying no and stuff, but it‚Äôs the type of thing where she‚Äôs asking me for money and shit for some. Thing that y‚Äôall should know is that *obviously* she doesn‚Äôt take them. Maybe one a week if she feels like it. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know it‚Äôs my fault for misplacing mine, and I‚Äôm NOT trying to act as though I am *entitled to her medication*. But hopefully some of you guys understand where I‚Äôm coming from. So I just had to ask my dad for $5 so I can give it to her tomorrow for 2 fucking films. 

The reason why I‚Äôm like this is because A- Like I said she doesn‚Äôt even take them, and B- Last time we chilled I sparked her on a fat blunt and shit. Not to mention before I knew that she was prescribed Suboxone, I had offered her some of my Zubsolv if she ever needed. It‚Äôs like come fucking on... I 200% understand, know, and have experienced heroin addiction, y‚Äôall know that, I mean go look at my post history. But for fucks sake‚Äî something you don‚Äôt need nor take and you‚Äôre like holding onto it for dear life? I have to beg you for 2 fucking strips? Go fuck yourself. 

I always said that I would support her, considering when I was at her house she was going back and forth whether or not she wants to be sober, and I know she doesn‚Äôt. Plus again I know how it is. But it‚Äôs getting to the point where I can and WILL love you from an arm‚Äôs length. 

Idk, I just wanted to vent and get your guys‚Äô opinions. What do y‚Äôall think about the scenario??

EDIT: What IS a friend‚Äôs responsibility then guys?! Is ‚Äúmaking sure a friend is okay‚Äù not one?! Cause if not, I‚Äôve been being a friend ALLLL WRONG ",1547170076.0

I've lurked on this sub for a while but I've never posted. I apologize first off for the wall of text- I'm trying to convey the whole story succinctly. Just got off the phone with my Dr's office and felt the need to post here just to get something off my chest. In 2015 I tried heroin for the first time and within a few months I was a full blown addict. I got clean May 17, 2018, but for the first few months of being off drugs I fell into what a lot of addicts do, which is that I was drinking quite heavily for a bit there. I've always enjoyed drinking and have at least a glass a wine r 2 pretty much every evening, but I haven't been drinking as heavily at all as I was at the beginning of me being clean off dope (when I briefly was drinking in the mornings sometimes just to get that ritual of feeling inebriated like when I was using). Last week, I  went to the doctor for a physical for the first time in almost 8 years (longish story but no health insurance plus I'm relatively young) and they drew blood and did other tests. Well, the office just called and asked for me to come in again this Monday because the doctor was concerned with something having to do with my liver, and they told me not to drink any alcohol at all between now and my appointment. I'm so nervous,  y'all. My mom passed away when she was 45 to breast cancer and my father also died fairly young (50, he committed suicide) and I've always  been so fearful of the same fate. I've only recently started to get my life back together (got accepted to a really good college,  doing lots of self improvement things like yoga and reading and meditation and whatnot) and I really don't feel like I have anyone to turn to right now in my moment of insecurity and uncertainty. I just wanted to share that with this community and ask if anyone has similar stories or can offer any advice. Thank you guys",1547161081.0

After being into drugs heavily at college, seizing after a Xan withdrawal, and being resigned to walking in circles and smoking weed all day every day in my parents' living room, never thought I'd feel truly euphoric again, it was over, flew too close to the sun. None of my IRL dealers were into the downer opiate scene much, nor would they enable me if they were. But finally my cavities and teeth caught up to my reckless treatment of them, neglecting to brush most days and  eating hella chocolate bars. Now usually when going to the dentist they'd fill in a cavity or three, with nothing more than novocain and sent me on my way, not even nitrous. However this time it was a cavity they'd already tried filling in and it got so close to the nerve that a root canal was warranted. And yup, eight 7.5/325s prescribed and a $200 bill. I knew my low-key scheme would eventually work! Couldn't stop myself from taking less than three per day, but was able to cut myself off after that. Those two days were so pleasant, and yeah I'm sure those of y'all with a tolerance must be pretty jealous I could get off on so little. But yeah, you know how it goes, now they're gone and I want more, so it's back to walking in circles and hitting the bong and eating chocolate bars and not brushing.

My habit wasn‚Äôt too bad this time, so WD‚Äôs weren‚Äôt gonna be anything out of this world. So a couple hours after doing my last dose, I wanted to get a good night sleep (as much as I could before sleep was hard to come by), so I decided to take half a leftover Seroquel I had from rehab. As I‚Äôm drifting off to sleep, I suddenly start feeling that creeping feeling of WD‚Äôs coming on. I think to myself ‚Äúdamn, that last shit I got must have been garbage with no legs,‚Äù but then it starts rising really rapidly, and before I know it, my body is literally ICE cold, I have the most intense feeling of dread and panic, burning in my chest, the whole fun shebang. That‚Äôs when it dawns on me... I suddenly remember my naltrexone pills looked exactly like my Seroquel pills. My heart literally sank, and I started panicking the fuck out. Ran to the bathroom and forced myself to throw up, hoping the entire pill hadn‚Äôt dissolved (it had). I kept asking myself how long is this feeling gonna last? What if it gets worse as more of the pill gets absorbed. I had never taken naltrexone before, and all I could think of at the time was how sub PWD‚Äôs can last days (I was too freaked out to remember that PWD‚Äôs from subs last really long from their long half-lives, and maybe PWD from naltrexone doesn‚Äôt last as long). It was fuuuuucking miserable and so scary. Doctor said don‚Äôt take it until 10 days after your last dose. I took it 2 hours after my last dose. Thank God, I‚Äôm feeling better this morning. 


What‚Äôs crazy is that I‚Äôm not feeling much WD‚Äôs at all this morning. Does taking naltrexone speed up your WD‚Äôs? Like you have them really intensely, but for a lot less time. Isn‚Äôt that how rapid detox works?

So I used to be an IV heroin user (about 4 years?) stopped in 2016 and took a short break, but then got back to prescription pills (everything from 30s to norcos....and I just eat or snort them). I don‚Äôt do them every day. Sometimes I will do them a week or two in a row, but not always. and I‚Äôve smoked a little BTH here and there. I also took Kratom for a while and have done plenty of suboxen (IV üò¨üò¨üò¨). But nothing for like two weeks and only sporadically before that.

For a while now, I have random dope sick symptoms. My legs will ache. I‚Äôll throw up or get the runs (or worse). I‚Äôll get a runny nose. Headache. Kratom or opiates will make it go away. But it‚Äôs like ...why? Why would I have acute symptoms if I haven‚Äôt used in two weeks?

The a WEIRDEST PART WHICH I REALLY hope someone can give me some answers on, is twice now I‚Äôve gotten what was DEFINITELY dopesick AFTER using pills. Like a hangover almost. Way too soon for someone to be dopesick. Example: did about 90 mg of oxy over the course of a night and by 3 am I was puking and feeling dopesick. It‚Äôs not like when you do too much dope and you just puke or whatever, i was in bed sweating, shaking, kicking, puking. WTH? It happened another time too.

What gives?!?!? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Are my receptors just so damaged that I‚Äôm dope sick for life????? Are these hep C symptoms? (I was tested years ago in a detox place and they said my enzymes were fine but who knows).

Just did some and passed oit over 10hrs + benzos +107mg methadone,"Soo had a meeting w my lawyer and my mathadone clinic counselor, was nervous bcni knew I was gonna get ""3 month trial probation"" and if I use heroin them it !eans jail which I love using.

I'm on a benzo taper down to 55mg diazepam a day, 20 mg AM, 15mg afternoon, 20mg PM.

But I said fuck it I'm nervous and gobbled down 40mg

So we talked they said the benzos were making me act weird, everyone has said that including my gfs just way way more talkative and interrupting people and talking to strangers about innaprop things like saying ""damn or ass"" which to my older gf she doesn't see respectful, it's not but I thought ""hey it's just me being me""

So anyways I didn't care my gfs got a check and I'm getting paid around $150 tmrw after work so we spent her whole $120 on H and bars, oh yeah a $10 eigth for her bc I hate weed it makes me paranoid.


Went to the dgirl! Paid $80 for my gram after using the test strip I know why people pay $100/g) she swears up and down I'm the only one she does $80/grams for, and I have to get a whole gram. For my bday she did .75/$60 but that was an exception,no $40 halves lol. 
+ 8 bars for $44 (she upped me from $5 to $5.5 bc her guy upped her, could have said $6 but she knows I'm cheap, also the 2mg kpins went from ,$4---->$4.50 oh well still a bargain for when she doesn't have any bars. She said someone just bought 20 bars for $8 a pop so ,$160 so looksmlike those 8 I might be able to get a few more but then again maybe not. These are some of the last remaining script non pressed bars and people pay 3/$20 for fake pressed ones on the street so $44/8 ain't so bad.

I also owed her $14 so paid off $10 of that

Plus my gf loves her weed she grows personally and does $10 8ths after talking her down from $15, I told her legal weed places one in particular sells $2/gram prerolls and $7/8ths, Even 8 & 9 dollar 8ths of you want smth diff but still less than ,$10. Grams of dabs with content varying from 70%-92% for ,$10 a gram, it's a 15min drive but for the dabs the local store that sells for $20 price matches me.

Anyways......


So anyways I took:

40mg diazepam in the AM
Took my 107mg methadone dose
Picked up 1.0 in really good H (she now has ""light which is gunpowder and dark which is that straight oily tar, both good the dark is where it's at though, still same price, I equate dark shots w potency so opt for the """"dark"" which I think is way stronger she prefers it too. )

Got fent test strips from Tracey and thought ""she told me a year ago someone she sells to did a fent test strip and got a positive, thought that was hype. But sure enough 1 line, positive for fentanyl. 

I casually take 1.5 bars so 3mg alprazolam waiting for her to get back we divided them 5 for me 3 for her bc she takes 1 and is out for the count, sleeping not ODing.

So I thought ""so what it must have always been positive for fent I'll do my regular .3 shot and gave my gf a .2"" 

The .2 knocked her out but she was talking and just slurring. She casually takes a bar after and while it's in her mouth I say ""remember this has fent take a half""

I did mine and usually am an intramuscular user, hence why I use a bit more. Well the stars aligned and I got a vein second try, burned a bit but no miss. 

Fuck I remember how itchy my rush was and gf said I slurred a few words then passed out she checked and said I was breathing so slow it was ""barely breathing"" scary for her. 

10h later w a half g left I might stretch that into 2, shots each vs 1 of us ODing. We have narcan but w the METHADONE OMG that would be a wd nightmare!!!!

Still just took 20mg diazepam like scripted could have skipped but didn't for some reason. 


BTW showed her in a text a pic w a positive fent result ""yeah I know I told you a year ago I know it has to have fent to be that strong! Not that much tho bc the legs are still there along w the tar effect (6 monoaceytal morphine hits you diff than straight east coast refined diamorphine) 

Short story:

Today I took:

40 mg Valium
107 mg methadone
3mg alprazolam
.3 shot of fent laced dope, IV which I usually can't find a vein and IM 
Woke up 10 hrs later 
Took 20mg diazepam as scripted not like anything else was but I thought I needed it, hell I wanted it but in a small dose. 


Getting a work check of about ,$150 dont wanna blow it on drugs, no wonder vs a. ,$80 teener her $80 gram kicks ass it's got fent in it, so please don't think bc it's tar your are immune to getting a bag that is contaminated w fent. 


On a lighter note my dad bought me some blue and white Retro 4 Jordans!!!! I love them he dropped them off while I wasn't home bc he had to get back home which is 50 miles south. Prob dropped $200 on them, they have been tried on twice fick they look brand new. Prob won't wear and keep in the box too nice I'll be afraid of getting dirty!!


Got you tied up like my Retro 4s - Kid Ink: No Strings ever since then I wanted a blue and white pair and he got me one even though they are damn near impossible to get!

I learn new things every single time I open the app. I love lurking and reading and learning about people that are different than me, that live different lives that I'll never know anything about.

I lurk here a lot and I just wanna say that I see you guys. I see your struggles, I see your pain, your resilience, your empathy. One thing I notice among addicts is that despite the stigma of being ""bad"" people who don't give a fuck about anyone else, a lot of you guys have a common denominator that makes you empathatic and actually, very loving people. I think it's pain. It's heartbreaking.

Those of you who struggle everyday, I wish you all love and peace. If you're trying to get clean, I'm rooting for you.

I don't know if this kind of stuff is something you guys welcome here but if it made one single persons day a little better even for just a second, I'm happy.

Edit: Wow, I didn't really think this would get much attention at all. For those of you who liked this, I'm so glad. The ones who didn't, that's ok too. I don't know what any of this is like so I can't judge how you feel. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment!",1547105759.0

aege82,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aege82/snowed_in/,3,https://redd.it/aege82,Waiting_on_a_Corner,Snowed In...,"Adin and I had moved in two weeks previous and the two bachelor apartment looked the part. Upstairs our two separate rooms were filled with boxes and mattresses from Craigslist. I  had won the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors and got the bigger room.

 Three big windows spread across  the wall facing the street, to the right was a wall with 2 sets of double closet doors that spanned the wall, to the vanity area. The vanity was a one person square, cabinets, a sink, mirror, and light bar opposite floor to ceiling shelves. The door to the toilet and an uncomfortable, cheap, bathtub and shower, faced one window on the wall. More scarred faces and unwanted surprises had alredy happened because of the rooms set up than I'm willing to admit. Adins room mirrored mine with the exception of his walk in closet and smaller windows, our beds in the corner same corners. With moving boxes for a nightstands and goodwill lamps as the only lights, our rooms reflected us individually.

With the old surf and skate pictures that I taped up on my walls and my longboards, I hung on to being the fun California bro, the old mask I worked hard to keep it in line. The rest of the room, devoid of anything but a red blanket and  a picture frame with 4 pictures stashed in it. The picture on top depicted my uncle and I at the beach in '08, walking down Pismo beach toward a distant peir. This was the part that reflected a me devoid of any hope, with a bit of love and full of memories I wished I could go back to.

The creature hiding behind the mask, pressing buttons and controls, taking care of mundane tasks, social and church obligations, making friends, being in the action, keept my secrets deep within it's veins. Any sane person would want free of this mask and the parasite within, changing you bit by bit. Instead I  embraced the mask, it took care of everything and I lived in stoned bliss. 
---------------------

The rest of the apartment had blank beige walls, a small sparse kitchen furnished mostly by my grandmother. I  was the first grandchild for her, and I took advantage of the generosity quickly whenever the apartment needed something.

The one thing we did have plenty of was sofas. My mother had been on Facebook finding every free couch avaliable for us. We picked up 3 at once one night, one for smoking weed out on the porch, two had good views of the loaned projector on the family room wall. Eventually there were two more where the dining nook should have been, for those who had partied into unconsciousness. 

The three defining characteristics of our apartment were the sofas, the shopping cart, and the giant, industrial, wooden spool that served as a coffee table. The empty spool had been in the appartment when I came home from work, apparently Adins brother had found it? But who cared? It was pretty cool and weed crumbs could always be found in the cracks.

The shopping cart was another matter though... On our first night Adin suggested we get sofa trays from the  Bed Bath and Beyond in the shopping center behind our row of apartments. He convinced me saying he'd get a grape Game at the Food Lion. We dicked around like only newly free 20 year old boys could but left with two tables and a towel for Adin. We raced carts outside as soon as the words ""first one home wins"" came out I knew I had made a mistake. Adin stole meaningless shit for fun, and started bolting home cart and all. I yelled but it was to no effect, he had his mind set, and I cut through the woods home. I had started rolling the Grape Game into a blunt when Adin burst in the loose door, shopping cart first. We fought briefly but in the end, it collected junk, and a peace blunt was smoked on the porch.
-------------------------- 

It was Monday, we should have been at work, slaving and sabotaging away. Instead we both sat on the porch wrapped in robes and blankets, passing a blue double bubbler back and forth. As the world around me became picturesque like Planet Earth, I relaxed and let it take me for a moment. Over the weekend the earth had blessed and cursed all the Triangle, the first snowstorm of the year was heavy, wet and cold. It snowed, melted, and froze everything to a sheet of ice. For Travis our employer this was a problem because work couldn't be done, for us it was heaven because we had heat, an Xbox and weed. After a half hour out in the cold, smoking every remnant of weed and resin Adin squints at me and says he's hungry. I suggest Starbucks and he suggests bagels and so our quest begins.

Starbucks never closes so we decide to go there first, the place was packed. Suits, determined to get to the office, beside moms, just trying to get some caffeine until it's an acceptable time to drink mommies special ""juice"", and teenage girls. The normal crowd for the day, with two flies in the ink. Adin and I, Adin couldn't get his eye drops in so his eyes looked like tomatoes. In addition to this he was wearing a very fashionable pair of footy pajamas that made him look like a penguin and his robe over that. I wasn't doing much better though I had on dark blue joggers that weren't mine, my favorite light blue Scary Kids Scaring Kids t-shirt. Complete with a T-Rex and robot wolves fighting on it, a wool Mister Rogers sweater and a blanket I had methodically folded into a thick scarf, made me looking homeless. We looked stoned and smelled the part too, moms quietly hushed their children about us. Some kids even manage to point before they are scolded. 'I don't care what anybody thinks' is the thought that fules me as I stand at my full 6'1"". 

A cop standing at attention in the corner  catches my eye briefly, as I surveyed the room. I keep him in my peripheral vision as we order two large, and complicated bean waters. Eventually he shrugged and went back to his phone, confidence really is the key, I suppose. As we get our coffees Adin turns around, a petrified look plastered on his face. ""Dude there's a cop right there, let's get the fuck out of here"" he says, heading quickly for the door. I simply smirk and follow Adin out, clutching our coffees for warmth, we cut across the frozen parking lots toward Brugers.

Brugers was also packed with people, no cops though. I'm a Californian through and through, where Brugers doesn't exist, so I am lost in the menu and procedure. Adin orders for both of us, as I stumble about with my wallet open. I hand my card to the cashier with shaky hands, I am not confidant in this place. But we leave with three bagels and one salmon bagel sandwich thing I had managed to order. The trek back home was a delicate dance of avoiding ice and holding hot coffee. We made it home in one peice along with our breakfasts. As we wolfed down the amazing food, I told Adin over and over how amazing my sandwich was.

After breakfast came our first hot box of the closet under the stairs. We designated this the official house hot box room as it was under the stairs, it barely fit two people, and it was in the bathroom with a fan downstairs. After our hot box session we emerged ready to take on the onslaught of online multiplayer Call Of Duty.
--------------------------

Most of Monday and Tuesday were lost to this cycle of drugs, video games, and sleep. When Wednesday came around it was obvious that we would be working on Thursday, snow was piled on the shady side of the roads but the roads themselves were 85% clear. Like the ice our vacation was coming to an end. A last hurrah was our signature move and so we threw a party that night. Lucas and Mira made the drive, to our humble escape. Lucas had used the snow as an excuse to stay with Mira for a few days, against his parents will. I had picked up Brooke yesterday, and she had an excuse to stay the night. Val was the last addition to the party having trugged through the snow for two and a half to make it to our place. Adin supplied her with dry clothes, while we debated the best way to mix Everclear. 

One part Everclear for every 2 parts lemonade, this was the concoction we all agreed on for the night. We began a game of Red, Purple, Black, a terrible game of probabilities, none of which were in your favor. Within thirty minutes I was already ""the floor is my home now"" drunk, Adin and Brooke got me upstairs with some struggle.

After what felt like a couple hours and a loud drunk sex session, I emerge soberish and unashamed back to the party. As soon as Adin saw me he exclaimed ""He Lives!"", I take a small bow as Adin hands me half a blunt. Lucas and Mira had taken my usual couch seat, so I sat on the floor. Brooke wound around me, love and warmth radiate between us. Between pulls from the blunt we passed our only controller around the room, every time we died. 'Is this what the 90's were like? Trading controllers, only one screen on, just friends hanging out'. I archive this thought to ponder later while much higher, as I return to the conversation. Adin is watching Lucas play Call of Duty, talking loadouts. Brooke, Mira and Val are talking about something they saw on Facebook or Reddit. I settle into the rythym of the night, smoking, videogames, chiming in to conversation. 'Ahhhh...' This is well worth every day I've let slip away unpaid.

Inevitably Thursday will come and I will have to return to pretending to be an adult. Until then I will remain in this moment.

I came across them while cleaning a condemned house a hoarder had previously lived in.  The pills expired in the mid 2000‚Äôs, but from my reading it seems they should still be okay for consumption.  Two of the days I took the pills I also hit one or two small dabs after swallowing them.  I can‚Äôt say I felt any euphoria whatsoever, mostly just got really heavy eyed and sat there feeling kind of content, but also wondering if that‚Äôs all there was to it.  Maybe the dabs overpowred the hydrocodone, but the day I tried it without smoking I got the same results, heavy eyes and overall very tired.  Anyway, it wasn‚Äôt a full bottle when I found it, but pretty damn close.  How easily will I get hooked on these things if keep doing them like this?  I have no other source for them and wouldn‚Äôt have any interest in seeking them out either.  I did also find some generic ambien, a muscle relaxer called Parafon Forte, and some other bottle I can‚Äôt remember while cleaning the house.  I‚Äôve smoked for quite some years now, and tried Xanax one time two years ago but haven‚Äôt touched it since.  I‚Äôve always wanted to try harder drugs, but now that I have them I wonder I shouldn‚Äôt just flush them before I get too deep.

I am here for my opiate/heroin addiction that has had its ups and downs in my life since 2008, disappearing after therapy or medically assisted treatment only to rear its ugly head back into my life always at different times and sometimes at the worst of times. 												
Ive been dealing with a pretty bad relapse really since Dec 2017. It started creeping in Sept 2017 and by April of 2018 all I could think of was getting high . Granted sometimes I would supplement with Kratom to not use every single day but I did use say 5 days out of the week. The year then included me overdosing, being found naked and dead by my partner (now ex) who dressed me and called 911. They administered narcan multiple times until I had to have it IV in the ambulance where I came to. I then kept using, went to rehab, was clean for 4 months, fell in love at rehab, we ended up using together. I started using needles, I got compulsive and didn‚Äôt want to stop. My family sent me here.	 
I have 5 days left here at this beautiful house that was started by an older Canadian lady who is now deceased and left the place to a group of 4 Mexican hippie kids who work in the health care field , emt tech, nurse, and a couple other people that work here. She met these kids while down here trying to start an Ibogaine clinic. They shared her love of pot smoking and the healing power of plant medicine and psychedelics. This place has treated people from celebrities to humbolt pot growers, to people from all over the US and Europe. This place is good vibes for sure. 	

I have been here for a week now. Just starting to feel better. My Ibogaine treatment happened Thursday night so it has been 5 days without any opiates. I woke up from my trance with no withdrawal symptoms despite it having been 24 hours since my last dose of morphine. However, I threw up a couple times the next morning and while throwing up I went into full on withdrawal mode, sweat from every pore of my body, shaking, chills, muscle spasms, but as soon as the puking ended I was back to feeling fine. This happened both times. I had also fasted since noon Thursday so I had nothing in my stomach but water. 								
Later in the day I felt the Ibogaine completely wear off and I felt some slight withdrawal symptoms at night like restless legs and watery eyes, enough to keep me from sleeping. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep much since then without muscle relaxers, clonidine and benzos that I shamelessly look from the office not knowing they would give me some if I had only asked, which i did last night and the night before. I also found some Imodium the first night after Ibogaine and took a bunch of that in a desperate attempt to stop my restless jerking legs. 	
Hopefully tonight I can finally sleep with maybe just melatonin and Tylenol . I‚Äôm still having lingering withdrawal symptoms like random pains and sneezing. Someone here said that those are also lingering effects of the Ibogaine but I don‚Äôt know how much I buy that. But today I finally took a shower without being forced to and went out on errands with the care takers here. They kept trying to get me to come out of my room last few days and I was just not feeling it lol. Finally feeling like myself and with my cravings being way less than they usually are when I typically quit. So I would say today is a good day. Got some drawing supplies to keep me busy and finally listening to music again. Just wanted to share my experience since I know many of us have wondered about Ibogaine for a while.

TLDR at bottom.


  This was a huge problem for me a few years back when I was trying to hide my almost daily usage from my girlfriend. She doesn't use drugs but is very hip with what the  behaviors are and the fact that if my pupils were pinned then then was high. So I was always getting busted. 

So I did a bunch of research found out that the drug that the eye doctor uses to dilate your pupils can also be found OTC at any pharmacy sold as nose drops. 

It's called phenylephrine. It is sold as an alternative to Sudafed and it is the same exact thing and eye doctor uses to dilate your pupils. 

No I wouldn't recommend using it in your eyes daily because I'm not sure that it's used in that fashion medically. However, I have been been using it about once or twice a week off and on for 5 years and my most recent eye doctor visit showed my eyes were perfectly fine minus my slight nearsightedness that hasn't changed in years. 

3 drops in each eye does the trick FOR ME. 40 minutes later my pupils look normal. Careful not to over do it or you look like you're tripping balls. 

TL:DR I was tired of being called out for using because of my pinned pupils. So I did some research and found out the chemical PHENYLEPHRINE which the eye doctor uses to dialate your pupils can be bought OTC. It's sold as  store brand nose drops. 3 drops in each eye does the trick for me YMMV. 

But don't take my word for it...consult your physician....or..........Wikipedia.

I'm writing a short film about my experiences with the girl who I was   deeply in love with who was a heroin addict. We're not together anymore,   for obvious reasons, but it has helped me to process it by writing a   short film about it.

I plan to shoot the   film in March. I, myself, am not a drug user and I never saw her use   until the end (boy, what a fight that was -- I should say: I don't have   problems with drug use unless it's a problem for someone and it was   definitely a problem for her, she wasn't happy, it was ruining her life, and that's when it becomes an issue. Until then, as-salamu alaykum.)

But   for the film, I think it's important that the woman be more of the  main  character than the man, and I think it's important to show aspects  of  her using. I don't want to get it wrong though, and every time I  google  ""how to cook heroin"", all I get is drug abuse help sites. I've  tried to  google this a hundred different ways and can't find anything  that just  says how to do it.

So... how  do you  ""cook"" heroin? I know the process is just liquefying heroin so  it can be  injected, is it literally that simple? A la: put powder  heroin in a  spoon, heat spoon, powder becomes liquid? Or is there more  to it?

Anyway. Baltimore fent warning. Name of caps is ""Power"".... Southwest side of the city. Shit is better than the Lex Luger caps that seem to be sold at this same spot half the time. I'd say about double the potency of lex Luger. Lex Luger is fentanyl too (I've never done real *HEROIN* + quanine scramble. Done enough raw to kill and elephant but I've never actually seen scramble with actual raw dope in it, it's always fent now). It's like they switch back and forth from power to lex Luger all day everyday at this spot. $6 caps. I feel like all of this Info is enough for you to know if you cop in the city at this spot that you know exactly where Im talking about.


Second spot I can't say the name of the street so I don't know how to explain to you guys without sourcing. No name caps. They are $4-$5 each. These caps are WAY STRONGER than Power. Like, I straight DIED off a key bump of these caps.. like 3-4 times? I cant remember  I've overdosed more than 10 times (like  numerous doses of narcan needed - overdoses) I can shoot half of sometimes even an entire cap of the Power caps so that should tell you just how powerful these caps are.

This spot is still SW Baltimore. Not too far from the B&O railroad muesaem. (Idk how to spell museam? Mueseam? Lol). WAY less known than the spot that sells power.

aeb9bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aeb9bc/modern_class_slavery_the_need_for_escape_and/,14,https://redd.it/aeb9bc,JunkieWithaGun1,"Modern Class Slavery, the need for escape and other socio-political ramblings","It goes without saying we are all more or less bound to servitude. Everyone from the upper middle class to the lower classes living in poverty. With poverty being subsidized in America, no matter how much they try to deny it, these classes are essentially the same. The only difference is perceived wealth, material possessions and the massive amount of debt they incur trying to get there. All but the top percentile will ever really own thier properties, homes and vehicles. Whether we'd like to acknowledge that we truly are slaves (It's a heavy burden to bear) it's still there in the back of our minds, we know there is little hope to break free from this system. That leads to a universal need, the need to escape our manufactured realities in whatever means deemed nessecary. Many people use drugs to escape, once an efficient and viable tool, becomes a burden of its own. The question is whats next? How do we cope knowing what we know to be undeniable truth looming like death, I feel an utter sense of doom for our society and the human race as a whole. 

We were created as a slave race, with the thoughts of our creators dancing in our heads. Free will wasn't given to us, it was a mistake in the bio-engineering process, a trait of future versions of self aware, post-prototype humans. (Before you think im completely crazy, look it up) At least 3 distinct species of man popped up and co-existed to varying degrees at once. To this day we can't find a common ancestor, not that evolution doesn't exist, because it clearly does. The distant link to chimps is easily explained, our creators blended the DNA of native primates with thier own, creating an alien hybrid slightly more adapted to terrestrial life than themselves. Strong, hardworking and stupid. The perfect slaves. 

If we were created as slaves why do some of us have such a hard time dealing with it? I've come to realize, I'm getting too old to fight it anymore. Eventually we all come to submit, something I couldn't quite understand in my youth. Those of us who are more intelligent than the people we work for (I'm pretty sure being an asshole is a key factor in winning a dead end management position.)  Tire of taking orders quickly, a curious trait for a slave. 

The thing is, in America we are downtrodden just enough to be resentful, yet not enough for full on rebellion. Which brings me back to the subsidation of poverty. Do you honestly believe in the SNAP/Foodstamp program as an act of compassion? Hardly, starving slaves revolt 100% of the time. Subsidizing poverty keeps politicians from being murdered in the streets. (for the most part) The middle class hates this because they think they are paying for it when in reality they are paying the salaries of our overlords, our law makers, who are pulling in 6 figure incomes off the backs of hard working Americans. We must realize, we are in this together, it's us against them and it will always be that way. ",1547067437.0

So iv been an opiate addict clean on and off for about 12 years and I haven't taken street heroin for around 6 and a half years and I'm pretty sure I'l never take it again as that life almost killed me so I have no craving or desire for that anymore,

 However since the birth of my son 3 years ago iv been using a drug called zapain which I get on prescription free in UK where I live and I also use illicit tramadol on top. Zapain is a codeine based painkiller. 

I do have legit pain needs due to my back and pelvis being damaged during my pregnancy but I can't function without them now I'm addicted to them physically so I would get ill without them.

At about 1800 hours I went to El Pollo Loco (bomb in my opinion) and got a Chipotle Chicken Burrito. Shit was impressively good. I'm like definitely a California burrito connoisseur. Maybe I'll start a vlog/IG of traveling California eating California burritos everywhere detailing the burrito but also catch some street art and skylines and shit.

Anywho, went to the dispo to pick up some pot products. Got myself some sour gummy belts w/ 300 mg of THC plus a gram of mid shelf sativa and a g of ""mid-shelf"" (still ridiculously fire bud at most likely 14%-19%), all for $24. They gave me a dab on the way out the door (God bless the recreational pot game, so convenient and awesome to browse the wares and try different stuff). I got into work a good 10 mins late bc I took a few wrong turns haha.

At work I basically do nothing and then once an hour on the half hour climb in a floating blimp, record multiple digital/analog readings such as Barometric pressure, helium pressure, and Outside Air Temperature plus Super Heat Temperature. Right after I got to work I had the munchies so I ate all 300 mg of them pretty much without thinking about it cuz they taste so good lol.

ae0r69,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ae0r69/a_home/,8,https://redd.it/ae0r69,Waiting_on_a_Corner,A Home.,"""Well I'm from California I moved here about 6 months ago in January"" I said clearly. I sat upright with my chest puffed to seem confidant in the small entry area of The Best Pest Control. Travis the owner sat across from me in his office chair asking me questions on my background as part of my interview to be a ""The Best Pest Control Technician"". I already knew I had the position, small mom and pop business like this need to replace someone fast when they leave otherwise work backs up and they go under. But I had another advantage, I was raised Mormon and went to church most sundays. Travis was a good Mormon father and hired the office manager Tayler from his old congregation. The Mormon connection, as cheesy as it is, came through for me. After Travis decided I must be a good person, I am a Mormon after all, we shook hands and I started Monday.


This was how I came to meet and live with Adin. Adin was the office assistant, he did anything he was told by Travis and Taylor. I had seen him at church a couple times, clean cut, well styled hair, he looked like a good young man. Though looks were deceiving Adin enjoyed getting high, partying, and drinking, he wore the mask. His secret reflected mine, I also dabbled in debauchery. I had been a regular at the Bullpin, pounding four dollar pints of Red Oak between turns playing pool with Jacob and Lucas, every Thursday for 4 months now. Most Saturdays when I told my parents that I was out with my Mormon friends I was at parties. I had friends at work from the ""ghetto"" city next to ours where I stuck out from everyone with my California style. Flip flops, jeans, a tank top, and perfectly styled hair, that was my statement every summer night since I had moved. But in the ""ghetto"" crowd I was the only white guy at parties, drinking Reds, and finding the stoners and druggies. Hoping to trade decent beer for a hit or two of whatever they had. I tested Adin casually by mentioning getting drunk and stoned at a party. He wasn't fazed, and spoke about getting stoned out of earshot of everyone else. Soon Adin, Lucas, and I were all partying.

This was exactly the opposite of the intentions I had when I first landed across the nation from all my old problems. I moved here with a tentative verbal agreement with my parents. The agreement was I got to live there for one year, paying 200 dollars a month, if I stayed clean of drugs and went to church every Sunday. As simple as that. I was already past every minute withdrawal from the alcohol and smoking an ounce a week, when I stepped off the plane. So why was I on the roof of a beer garden downtown ""sobering up"" with Lucas? I pondered this briefly, staring at a vile wheat IPA Lucas picked that sat in front of me. Lucas had bummed a single cigarette from some girls on the street, lifting it from him was a bit of a dick move, 'eh,we're best friends'. Lucas was droning on about how drunk he was, trying to think of how to get us back to his parents. He scheemed as I lit the cigarette and pulled in a lungfull of tar, nicotine, and sweet MAOI's. Mmmmmmmm...... That's why people do this, I hit it again and handed it to him. He accepts it, not even noticing I stole it, I shrug and chug down half of my disgusting drink. 

""Fuck, we're fucked"" Lucas exhaled.

""Dude I was already fucked, I have to move in a month"" I said monotone and hopeless. ""My parents said I could stay till January, then I'm on my own for good"" I pounded the last of the beer and took the cigarette back.

Lucas looked at me shocked I hadn't mentioned this to him earlier. Though quickly his face changed to mischief. Mischief and fun were what Lucas was best at, always pushing shots, double strength drinks, always trying to make every night amazing. Slowly he took back the last of the cigarette and said ""You know Adin has been looking to move out, plus he's the office manager now...""


On Saturday Adin wanted some weed and I had a dealer, from my Algebra 102 class. Allen was chill, he sold weed so he and his girlfriend could smoke for free and that's all he wanted. He was nice and even had Brooke and I over for a movie night once. He wasn't looking for new clients but we were algebra friends, so I bought Adin along. We bought a quarter and they seemed to get along. It was a smooth transaction, in the car Adin packed his orange spoon and I divided the bag. We smoked on our way to take Adin back to his dad's truck. Adin looked at me as we turned on to the freeway ""we should be roommates"" he said. I laughed as I hit the bowl steering with my knee ""sure"" I said. It started as a stoned joke but after one mostly sober talk, 2 apartment visits, and some paperwork, Adin and I were roommates. 

We uses his dad's truck to get beds and move our four boxes of stuff. My mom found us four couches on Facebook and lamps came from Goodwill. It was bare bones bachelor living. Travis loaned us his projector and we proped it up on my longboard, it was gigantic on the wall. Adin supplied an XBOX and my grandma stocked our kitchen with cups and plates. We had heat, light, beds, and drugs. Lucas and his girlfriend set up the Wi-Fi while we were gone,  electromagnetic radiation broadcast out ""BrosB4Hoes"" from the living room, classy... 

We loved it, we had total freedom and we used it liberally. We threw a Spartan party the very first night we were there, Everclear lemonade flowed and weed smoke bellowed from the back porch with a loveseat on it. What would become my core group of friends sat there playing Red, Purple, Black. To my left was Lucas and his loving girlfriend Mira, as Kelsey. I had known Kelsey for a long time through church, and Brooke liked her. Adin and his new office assistant Val sat across from me, and leaning on me was my girlfriend Brooke. We laughed, got very drunk, and had a blast. In the end Val and Adin slept in his room and Brooke and I went in mine. From then on everyone came over just to blow off steam, it was a home and haven for us and our friends. We never had a dull night in our house.

 Brooke was 18 she was young and impressionable but, she had a will of iron and made things happen. I needed this because I had never had such adult responsibilities and was intimidated. That was not why we were together though., she cast a beautiful spell 
over me, we loved each other intensely, we had fought for it and won, we were invincible. I drowned into her beauty, 5'4"", Blonde shoulderblade length hair curled framing her fair round face, sea blue eyes, perfect Nordic beauty. An hour later she lay on my chest, I always synchronized my breathing to hers. She melted into blissfull sleep, carefully I reached to my right and hoped I had a roach on the table. My fingers found a
 crutch, paydirt, I put it in my mouth with my right hand and the grab a lighter. I look at it, about a centimeter of weed is visible.

'good enough'

I lit it expertly while stroking Brookes back to keep her asleep. Three hits later I taste paper and I chrush out the crutch on the nightstand. Rolling to the left I faced Brooke our legs intertwine. I tried to study her face, memorizing every curve and dimple. For the last week whenever I closed my eyes for bed I saw a silhouette of a girl. I had wracked my brain time and again but nobody I knew could match the silhouette, and it most definitely wasn't Brooke. I close my eyes and there she was again like the ghost of Christmas future. She sat staring at me, waiting for the minutes on her lilac mermaid timer to reach zero. I am paralyzed as the figure walks to me, she slowly strokes my face, ""turn before the cannons"" she whispered and smirked.

I was released as my eyes snapped open to the same curves I was memorizing were staring back at my shocked face. I gingerly got out of bed sweating and went to the very top shelf in the bathroom, quietly I pulled out a small bag of Xanax bars and broke half off. Expertly put the rest back, not hidden, just placed where Brooke couldn't see. I slid back to Brookes side and curled up to her.

 I don't remember closing my eyes again that night.",1546992281.0

Long story included.,"Ive been going to the same sub doctor for almost years now.  They are super cool as well as nice and genuinely care about the patients. Not only that but they only hire recovering addicts who have 2+ years clean. For over a year throughout my fiances pregnancy I stayed totally clean except for smoking a bit of bud. 

i had made the decision to quit my serving job at dennys and go back to car sales(which I consider my career and also love), but any of you who have ever been in car sales knows its drug infested. I did awesone for about 6 months. Kept to myself, had a daily routine of morning meditation, working out, and planning my day. 

Then we got a new salesman. He was around my age, had a false sense of self confidence and was great at talking to customers. His whole demeanor screamed adderall. This fucked came in and outsold me the first month. God my pride and my ego was destroyed. Here I am sober and on top of my game and Mr.Douche just comes in and takes over.

So I start to get a little bit closer to him and kind of hint about drug use and he pulls out this zip lock bag filled to the top with yellow schoolbusses(Xanax 2mg) and the pink circular pills(adderall, I forget what mg 30 I think?). Before I could even say no he had pulled a few of each out and handed them to me and down the hatch some went, and so the relapse began.

For a while it was great. Gave 0 fucks what I said to customers, had no filter, seemed to always say what they wanted to hear, and master manipulation which is what car sales is about for most people. I was unstoppable. Selling one a day at least which in this business would net you 8-10k a month at the right dealership. I was putting money back and life was good at the time.

Then came my downfall. One day out nowhere I scrolled through my contacts and ran across the all familiar (John R) in my phone. Which is what my dboy was always saved under. I clicked on his name, typed out that ever so familiar text ""you good?"" and stared at it for about a minute. Sent... Now I feel like its important to mention here my complete lack of self control when it comes to H. I cannot conserve, I can't say no, I can't limit myself, and I don't know when to quit.

Within a month I went from salesman of the month to salesman of the bathroom 4-5 times throughout the day. I stopped my healthy morning routines and replaced them with morning shots. I stopped caring about my appearance. I stopped coming home with flowers, steak dinners and presents for my baby girl and started coming home with 8 balls, tv dinners, and track marks.

Life quickly fell apart again. This has all happened several times before. Seems to be a routine for me. It falls apart quicker and quicker each time. I blew through my savings in 2 months, had a gram + a day habit and a terrible attitude and depression that carried on from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning to the time I closed them at night.

I had previously worked my way up to monthly take homes at my doctor which was awesome so I only had to clean up for about 3 days a month to clean my system out for my appt and drug test. Well I pissed dirty and the look on my docs face when I walked into his office and he looked at my results. It was almost like a father being disappointed in a son. I lost my monthly and got brought back down to weekly. I lost their respect and also their trust.

That brings me to today. 5 months later. I lost my job, my car blew up on me, I am broke most of the time, ive got a crippling daily habit, and life is just all around shit right now. I am about to go piss dirty again for like the 20th time in a row. I'm surprised they still let me come but they haven't given up on me yet. Not to mention that its an all day affair because I have to take 3 different busses, an uber, and be at the doc for about 3 hours. Then make the trip back home.

Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to give you all something to read for those of you who are bored or like reading stories about people failing in life lol. I have a ton of funny/crazy stories about my car sales jobs over the last 5 years if anyone would be interested in reading about them. Let me know. Hope everyone is well today and either nodding or staying strong in sobriety. I respect all of you. Much love.

My mother had died after being ill for a long time, leaving behind an abundance of untouched morphine and oxycodone (not to mention a grieving wreck of a daughter). 

Early Monday morning I underwent invasive surgery (double jaw + 3 wisdom teeth removed) which left me in profuse pain. I‚Äôve since been loaded up on oxycodone, tramadol, and morphine. I assumed my tolerance would be back to nothing by now but that is not the case. I‚Äôve needed an obscene amount just to touch the pain, to the point where my doctor said most people would be well and truly unconscious on the amount I was given. 

At first the pain was too overbearing to even notice the effects of the drugs, but now it‚Äôs under control and I can really appreciate the high. I‚Äôve been in such a good mood all day despite the ordeal I just went through- chatting and laughing with the nurses (I‚Äôm usually an anxious introverted worry wart) and having great dialogue with my family and friends. The one and only downside is that my face is itching like mad but I can‚Äôt gain relief from scratching due to numbness. It‚Äôs a lot more infuriating than it sounds. 

I‚Äôm heading home in the morning and they won‚Äôt be discharging me with any opiates, unless you count panadeine forte (lol). 
It was fun while it lasted I guess. I don‚Äôt have the money or resources to continue with opiates anymore, nor the desire for my life to head back in that direction. But god was this a reminder of what I lost when I quit them. The pull is strong.

Probably a shit post. Apologies in advance.,"I'm coming up on 2 years since I last used. I've been on methadone (tried subs and just wasn't for me) during that time and stabilized at a pretty high dose and have been titrating down since. I'm around 50mg now.

Normally I'm the one on this sub cheering everyone on in their recovery and telling them how great they're doing and that the bad times will pass and just hang in there. But, I can't seem to convince myself of that.

A couple of months ago I had to get blood drawn for some tests and I think that triggered my needle fixation in my brain because ever since then I can't stop thinking about using. I dream about it every single night and nothing feels right anymore. I tried for 2 years to get my life back to 'normal' but the sad truth is it will never go back since I, like many of you, only ever felt normal when I was using.

I know it's stupid, I know the chances are slim to none, I know exactly what I would tell someone else if they were asking this question, but has anyone ever planned out a short relapse and then continued on in their recovery?

I just want some relief from this clich√© monkey on my back. I was thinking of using for a week and then hopping back on the wagon. It would fuck up my reputation with my doc and I would lose a take-home or two but I just don't know how else to shake this feeling. I miss the sweet nothingness so much. I miss the magic numbing of emotional pain so much. Fentanyl was my best friend for so long and heroin was a pretty decent runner up. Anyway. Watchy'all think? Pretty fucking stupid, right? Or has anyone managed this successfully before?

adsltg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/adsltg/the_weed_and_opiate_combo/,20,https://redd.it/adsltg,nsevyd,The Weed and Opiate Combo.,"Honestly I don't think people give this combo enough credit, I seem to be the only one out of my friends to point out how nice it is and euphoric and I dont see much mention online apart from one time.

&#x200B;

I remember the first time I smoked weed on opiates I had some codeine phosphate 60mg and went to a KFC drivethrough to get a boneless banquet and took 300mg as I was waiting. I rolled a phat 1g blunt while waiting aswell. So when I get home I feel it somewhat but I have never gotten why people loved the effects of opiates with some use in the past. Then I smoke this joint and very quickly it seems to intensify the codeine 10 fold and vice versa. Then I get upstairs put some trippy music on and am am scared to close my eyes because my breathing feels manual and I dont wanna just die right there and then because I read people stop breathing on overdoses because well theyre overdosing. I eventually give in and shut my eyes and am amazed by the pshychedlic closed eye visuals but at this point I am nodding to the max. Honestly opiates are no fun without weed for me. After that experience that combo was the only thing I could think about for a month till I did it again, like I dont know why I waited so long for something that felt so good. Anyone else feel same or just me

&#x200B;

TL;DR Weed makes opi high much stronger for me oh and I forgot to eat the boneless banquet.",1546939553.0

I was never a user when OCs were the norm, but I see a lot of people talk about the unmistakable scent and I wonder if that's what this is? Any ideas?

I've already tested them as positive for Oxy, so they are legitimate. Oddly, since they cost $5/20mg or $15/80mg... I'm trying to stock up, but I can't keep me grubby mitts off these stupid fuckers.

he offered to let us babysit his two very young kids for four days/nights in exchange for h and some cash. this was so he could rent out the top floor of a hotel and party for NYE. well, he let us stay sick the first two days and ignored all of our calls and texts about when we were gonna get well/get groceries for the kids (we didn‚Äôt have any food at our house) so we told him to either come get the kids or we‚Äôd have to drop them off at their mom‚Äôs. yeah it pissed him off, but we weren‚Äôt going to watch HIS kids while sick when he promised o keep us well. to make up for it he gave us a small piece a couple days later to split then promised us an undetermined amount later. 

when we *nicely* asked for the rest of the payment he claimed he couldn‚Äôt do it right now because he was ‚Äúbroke‚Äù. that‚Äôs been the story for the past week; he‚Äôs too broke to pay us cash, he can‚Äôt afford to front us, he can‚Äôt afford to throw us .4 to split to pay us for babysitting, etc. We‚Äôve been struggling to stay well without resorting to stealing or panhandling or something. 

tonight we came through to get my bf a point (im having to go on suboxone for a few days because we cant afford to keep both of us well) and this motherfucker wouldn‚Äôt even look at us. he took the 20, weighed out the piece, handed it back, and wouldn‚Äôt answer any of our ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù ‚Äúhow‚Äôs the new puppy?‚Äù type questions. didn‚Äôt say bye back to us or anything. oh, also he has FOUR new Louis Vuitton collars for his new dog and multiple gucci boxes everywhere. but he can‚Äôt pay us back? his loyal customers who fund his fucking lifestyle?

The 3rd is a girl i didnt know done it but found out from my long time chick friend because they was friends and she spilled the beans to me lol. Well all up until about a week ago, ive helped my long time chick friend out ALOT with many late talks about us hating who we have become and how we spent christmas together because noone else wanted us there. 
     So about a week ago she calls me crying her eyes out telling me how she fucked up so bad and got caught doing some thing sooooo fucked up. She talks about how she is never going to use Again.

     So next day comes around and I tried to call her and text her and I get no reply. I start freaking out. I was beginning to think she done killed herself because she was so upset do day before about what she had done. Second day goes around still no answer. And I start beginning to think what the fuck. Third day goes around still nothing, fourth day still nothing, 5th day still nothing, and today being the 6th day, she finally messaged back and says I can't be in contact with you because you have caved twice in the past six days where I haven't. I can't talk to you no more because you talked to them still and you still use.
     She begins telling me all this other different stuff about how she can be associated with me no more. And that she can't talk to me and this and that. And that hurts me. Because I love this girl so much. She means the world to me as a friend and if it were to be more than that that would make my day. Hell that would make my life to be honest. She literally broke my heart by telling me that. Because when she wasn't texting back I needed someone, anyone at all just to talk to but she was one of the last people to actually still be my friend. Because when I came out and told everyone I was in heroin addict trying to get help, I lost everyone. Everyone ran. No one talk to me anymore. Like I was some type of disease that they couldn't be in contact with.

Literally the biggest argument in our daily life is who is going first(its really sad). 

I know I'm ranting but I literally have no one else to talk to in my life. I have burned every bridge that was ever built. Not only that but I also burned the whole fucking town down. So to all of you on this sub I feel like I know many of you already by my excessive lurking. I hope to allow you to get to know me also. I am waiting on my shit to arrive now so ill post my first pic here in a bit. The all so rare fent free shit.

Tldr: long time lurker, finally made an account, look forward to getting to know all of you.

The government certainly isn't. There is a reason these drugs are illegal, and it's because people can't be trusted with them. We are a danger to ourselves, and possibly those around us if you're the reckless type.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I understand where you are coming from. This absolutely shouldn't be a criminal matter, but sometimes tough love has it's place.  
  
What the United States, and for that matter, the world, is experiencing, is a Health Crisis, and it should be treated as such.  
  
I offer you sincere honesty, and transparency. Try to look at things from another perspective. Instead of a drug addict feeling victimized, look from the eyes of your victims, your families that care about you. Look at it from the eyes of the parents finding their children, their babies, their sons and daughters, laying dead on the floor. Children, living with parents that neglect, steal from, and abuse them.  
  
Imagine the parents are the government our country has voted into a position of power, with the help of medical professionals, and people that care about harm reduction at their dispense.  
  
I'm speaking of an ideal situation, but humans aren't perfect. We trip, we fall. Lord knows we fuck up.   
  
But I have faith, that one day, we're going to get it right. There are people in our community striving to enact change. To make a difference in this world, but it can be overwhelming. They can't do it alone. They need your help.   
  
I challenge each and every one of you to tell me why I am wrong for this opinion. The fact is, most of Reddit looks at this community as a bunch of filthy drug addicts. To them, you're a bunch of thieving scumbags. We are a minority. But maybe, just maybe if they came here and saw more people trying to make a difference. Than maybe we can slightly shift that opinion.  
  
I would like to have an educated discussion about this. Some of you are incredibly intelligent.   
  
I also fully expect some of you are going to resort to name calling and imply that I'm a filthy communist and a puppet installed by our fascist government. And that's OK. You're entitled to that opinion. You're just wrong

Pulled through cotton it is very translucent (instead of being cloudy). It very likely had fentanyl cut into it, based on what I've read and the apparent strength, but it also definitely had heroin as well, based on the smell (and appearance). (I've noticed smell is the best indicator. It's hard to smell small amounts, like my 4 stamps for $20 that would normally be 25 bucks, but as soon as it hits water, it reeks of vinegar within a few inches of it.)

Anyways, I missed my shot, 4 stamp bags. Almost completely missed it. Normally, when something goes wrong, I still feel some rush because I obviously didn't miss the whole thing, but this time I must have missed the whole thing or almost the whole thing, I was trying to let the tourniquet off before I started pushing instead of right after pushing, which is stupid because I've been doing this forever and my go-to, gnarly twisted vein probably actually prefers the tourniquet being on at this point. So anyways I tried calling to turn it off and I must have just lost the vein and not got much of anything in there.. I got a nasty, itchy, raised white area raised and red and white Etc but it wasn't horrible because I knew that it would go away quickly and they wouldn't have an abscess or anyting because this stuff isn't that nasty.

They refuse to allow the supply of pharmaceutical grade heroin that could be precisely and consistently dosed.

**Where there is a demand, there will be a supply.** Our governments continue to gift this lucrative and highly profitable illicit drug market to violent criminals and organized crime. 

The 50 billion dollars the US government spends on this ""War on drugs"" each and every year is a lot more than 50 billion because for every dollar they directly spend, many more must be subsequent spent attempting to clean up the mess it makes. The profits and taxes from regulated heroin could **help to pay down** national debt. With an end to the war, they might well be able to **actually pay down** the debt as the spin-off and indirect economic benefits would be far reaching and enormous.

Some 50% of people in US prisons are there for simple drug possession. Just one of the many reasons (all reasons are inappropriate) they won't change the prohibitionist drug laws is because private prisons are big business, yet the savings from ending the ""War on Drugs"" would easily allow them to continue to pay these companies for running prisons that would be empty if the war was to be ended.

It's also racist and remains so. These laws first came to be **not based on the harm from the drugs, but rather who was perceived to be using them.** The first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada, driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition laws, similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws, all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. 

Today, many years later, these prohibitionist drug laws remain what is also clearly a war against people who don't have light colored skin: If you are apprehended in possession of illicit drugs, you have either a 90% chance of going to prison or a 10% one which can be directly correlated to the shade of your skin color, outrageous!

This senseless and wasteful ‚ÄúWar on Drugs‚Äù is not only very wrong (on so many levels) but also the most epic failure and inappropriate legislative policy of all time and has caused totally unnecessary immense loss of life and inexcusable human suffering which will no doubt be viewed in the future much like human slavery and the Salem witch trials are today.",1546891161.0

Sup guys. I've been an opiate user and lover for the past 5 years or so of my life, particularly the last 2 1/2 or so. I started getting real heavy into painkillers after a bad breakup and got addicted to taking 1-4 of the little blue 30mg oxys every day for about a year. That whole year was pure bliss and I loved every minute of it... Mainly cuz my tolerance hadnt ever been completely shot yet and those blues always got me feeling warm, fuzzy, and hella happy/optimistic about life. 

Well... After that year my plug got cut off and I had the choice of continuing on with the blues for $35-$40 a piece (was getting em for $10 prior to that) which obviously would have made me broke fast, or switch to H which my good homie claimed was the cheaper route and got you wayyyy higher. I knew I had already done China white a few times before and I really enjoyed that, especially mixing it with the blues. But I was never too big of a fan of tar, which was what my homie was recommending. I remember always telling him ""dude I'm not addicted to H like you are, I'm addicted to painkillers""... But I figured if my only option to continue using opiates was to start with tar then fuck it I might as well (worst choice ever btw). 

So I started off with making my tar into ""cheese"" so it went from tar to a snortable powder, a RoA I was already fond of so I took a liking to this method, and sometimes doing ""monkey water"" where you melt the tar down in water then shoot it up your nose. I began liking it more and more and eventually I started smoking it, since my homie claimed it got you way higher, and also would be better for me since putting it in my nose always clogged my nose and was semi painful to do anyways... So I started smoking it and my habit got worse and worse and so much more expensive then I could have ever imagined. It actually made me go broke for the first time in my life...  (Was smoking around 1-1.5g a day)

So Ive been dealing with this addiction to H for about the past year and a half and have quit and relapsed like 5 times in that period. I always relapse cuz I think I'll be able to handle it again ""only on weekends"" or ""just for a few days"" but I always fall right back into the cycle.... 

So my question to you guys is, if I was to quit for months this time, and perhaps come back to opiates with just weak painkillers on occasion, maybe once a week or every other week if even, do you think I would be able to handle it? Or fall right back into the cycle in time? Have any of y'all had success with this type of thing? I don't wanna go back to H, but I would like to be able to enjoy a painkiller from time to time, just like I do with any other drug. 

TLDR: used to love painkillers but my habit progressed to H, I've quit 5 different times already but always relapse and start again. Id like to quit for months and perhaps come back using only weak painkillers on occasion, no more H whatsoever. Have any of y'all had success with this kind of thing before? ",1546881988.0

That got me thinking about when that happened to me.

So my girlfriend at the time got in a bit of trouble and had to go to a year long rehab a few states over. And at the time I thought she was the one haha, I was 19 and o was I wrong but that‚Äôs another story. I was upset so my usage went up. I lived in a party house , so about a month later, I met this girl . She was a solid 8. Big ass,nice c cup boobs, pretty face, and about 120 pounds. 

We clicked that night and ended up sleeping together. We fucked for hours without me cumming. But I was able to blame it on the booze, I don‚Äôt think she minded anyway lol. Opiates are great for first sexual impressions. So the next day we hung out. One thing led to another and we fucked with the same result. This time we where both ‚Äúsober‚Äù. After a while we stoped. I could tell she was bothered. So I told her that I was in my own head and felt bad that I was cheating. She knew I had a gf and that we where together for a couple years. So she bought it. I did feel bad but I was young, dumb, high, and horny lol. 

A few days later she comes over and we have sex. About 40 minutes in she gets up quick and goes in the bathroom. I knew what that was all about. She‚Äôs comes out a few minutes later and gets dressed. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong and she‚Äôs like ‚Äú I really like you a lot, i don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre attracted to me. I‚Äôve never not made a guy cum‚Äù. Now, I could tell her I‚Äôm a heroin addict, which might scare her off. And honestly the sex was really good. Or lie my ass off. 

I choose the latter. I told her the first 2 times was a fluke and I was almost about cum. So a couple hours later we fuck again. At about the 20 min part. I faked cumming haha o how the roles reversed. She was all like did you cum in me? I was like yeah I told you it wasn‚Äôt you. She wasn‚Äôt as happy as I thought she would be. She told me she was going to go home shower, get ready and come back. 

When she came back she seem super happy. A couple hours later she started puking excorist style. All over my bed, door, floor. It was vomiting at biblical proportions lol. So I clean her up and everywhere else. She is aslo erupting from the hole down under. I feel pretty bad for her. I ask her what she thinks she has. Well apparently projectile vomiting and explosive shits are possible side effects of plan b hahaha. She told me she wasn‚Äôt on the pill and she didn‚Äôt want to get pregnant. And she didn‚Äôt tell me she wasn‚Äôt on the pill because she didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd fuck her. I never told her I faked it lol. 

I ended up breaking up with my gf for her. We didn‚Äôt last, she cheated on me, big surprise lol. She broke up with about a week before my ex got out. And we got back together. I have super crazy stories about that gf if anyone cares to hear those stories ",1546881711.0

Made it till last night, 48 hours after I had dosed Friday and I was yawning a bunch, runny nose, mildhot cold spells, mild anxiety, pretry nasty runs and inability to sleep. I have work at noon today so I was kinda dreading that until I decided to take some subs.

The only other time I had suboxone was last April in rehab and I wasn't using enough back then to really need any. Took 4mg and threw up for 24 hours pretty much because they way overshot the necessary dose if any lol. However, last night all my symptoms went away and are gone. I feel a just a little high but I will be able to function way better.

Two quick questions:

My withdrawls were pretty mild in the grand scheme of things, bout a 12 on the COWS scale. After this sub wears off will I be hurting very much at all anymore? 

Also, I have a dentist appt Friday and they are sedating me because I hate the dentist but the mixture I heard him say was fent and midazolam along with something else. Will the bupe or naloxone interfere?

&#x200B;

I need some insight from you fine people. Typically I only stick to oxys when it comes to daily use. However, for the past week straight I have been trying to cut down my oxy use because I can no longer afford to spend $300 a day on 10 30s... I had the brilliant idea to try and combat my cravings to do more oxy by using cocaine all day long with my oxys. The past week, I managed to cut my oxy intake down from a 300mg daily habit to I believe 150mg at most in one day. The other days I managed to only use around 90mg on average. Now, the problem is I told myself I would stop using cocaine after 2 days of consecutive use, but it's now been 7 days in a row and I am starting to get worried. When I jump off the oxy's completely, I am well aware that I will have to go through withdrawal from them. However, will a week straight of cocaine use ranging from .5 to 1g a day cause withdrawal symptoms from coke as well? I've also been taking 1-2mg of xanax a night the past 3 nights in order to fall asleep. I know this combination is dangerous and you all will probably think i'm a dumbass, but god damn doing coke and blues at the same time is fucking amazing. 

&#x200B;

Pretty much I'm just wondering how long it usually takes someone to begin to withdrawal from coke? at first I thought it would be similar to people who just began using oxy/dope daily where it takes like 1-2 months of consecutive daily use, but I have very little information on coke withdrawals and how long consecutive daily use would cause someone to withdrawal.

&#x200B;

This message is for my gf. I made plenty of mistakes since we've been able to have liquid Hydromorphone and Midazolam. I dont know how you can trust me anymore but thank you for keeping me after every benzo fucking mess i ever made.

&#x200B;

I just want to tell you my story guys and will understand how Wika is wonderful.

&#x200B;

We've been together for a year now. Yay ! But before we were a couple i was addicted to xanax. I was popping 12 to 20 xans a day. Wika, was the closest friend i ever had and I've known her for almost 10 years. When we began dating I was addicted to Xanax and she knew it but didn't think much of it until the first dinner she organized. She invited her friends over to introduce me. Everything was going fine until i was so high on ketamine and xanax that i broke a frame on her wall while walking like a drunk. That ended the night and all of her friends saw me as a fucked up druggie. Wika was mad at me for acting like a foul and she was right. I completely ruined that night and she was so happy to introduce me but i fuck it up.

&#x200B;

I made everything to make her angry at me while i was on xanax and she always forgave me because everything i said i would stop i did not. Then i started texting with my ex while i was high only when on xanax. I nearly lost Wika because of my bad behavior. I'm so sorry I'm still asking myself why are you still with me. I decided to stop xanax for good and i completely stop all contacts with my ex because its wrong and because i love my Wika more than anything. I wont be able to live without her. She's my goddess and i want to spend of my life with her.

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago we found a way to get Hydromorphone and Midazolam vials. So we began injecting. I already have a problem with both opiates and benzo in my past but how can i say no when i see Wika shooting up. She's the one who do the dirty work and obtain those vials. The addict in me feel like im not getting enough of it. She has the control of all of these vials mostly because i cant stop abusing Midazolam. I stole some vials a couple of time in the back of my girl because of my selfishness and she found out. I said i would never do it again but i did. Im so sorry, i know you could never trust me anymore. Thats why i decided to write this. To show you how sincere i am with my promise. I know it will take time for you to trust me again. I can show you that im able to respect my promise.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything. Its not easy for me to control myself with all that drugs near me but i can do it. I don't want to break you heart anymore. I know heard that alot of time but like i said i will control myself. I wont do anything on your back anymore because i will loose you and thats my biggest fear. Wika you're so good to me. Too good. You're the best thing that ever happen to me and i dont want to loose that.

&#x200B;

Since we've been shooting Hydromorphone regularly its been hard on our couple. We get mad at each other so easily and i feel that our relationship is fragile but i would do anything possible to please you like before. Opiates are really great together. I love our morning shots and our night shoot. The ones at your break. I dont want this to end i mean our relationship. Not because of drugs.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything in the world. Thank you for bringing me to BC last summer even if we had a rough ending in WDs for a week.

He says he was just relaying what he‚Äôd heard from someone else who copped them to me. The only thing that might have seemed off was when I would start to nod, I would get extremely vivid closed eye visuals which I‚Äôve never noticed before when nodding. 

Well, anyway, not sure what the purpose of this post was just wanted to share. Be safe out there. ",1546818653.0

A Safe Place...Kinda...," Edit for this sub: This is another one of my Blockbuster related stories but, since it has to do with drugs I thought ya'll would appreciate it as well.

Ya'll, keep asking for them so heres another one.

During the summer, and somewhat during the school year, parent would usually either drop their kids of or have them come to the store to wait on them. We thought it drove sales and as long as we didn't have to watch their every move we didn't give a shit.

Of course, these kids would get older and therefore, get into more shit...

So, one day on one of my many smoke breaks which I took on the left corner of the store as you were going out, the familiar and undeniable smell of weed flows by me. There were a few cars parked on the side of the building so I figured it was one of those. As I kept smelling it (and I'm not talking about some skunk shit either. The kids in this neighborhood came from upper-middle class homes so of course they had good smoke) I decided to see just where it was coming from. I didn't have to go far to see one of the regulars kids going ""Oh, shit the long haired guys seen us! Hide the shit! Spray the car!"" So, I creep up to the car and allow a wicked smile to crawl across my face. ""So, Max, what you doing buddy?""

Max, being about 16 or 17, I think, wasn't to knowledgeable about the ways of the world. He didn't know that a long haired white guy probably smoked weed. Knowing this I proceeded to fuck with him hard.

Max: Nothing, man. Just deciding what we want to get.

Me: Fuck, it smells like good weed out here! You guys smell that?

Max: Must be one of the other cars. (He says this while pot smoke continues to bellow out of his car window, mind you.)

Me: Ok, could you guys do me a favor?

Max: Yea, whats up?

Me: Quit bullshitting and pass that shit!

Well, he in fact did pass that shit, and from then on I had an understanding. Here were a list of rules that I gave Max and his friends.

&#x200B;

1. I don't know shit.
2. Only weed is to be smoked out here. If I see you out here snorting coke or shooting heroin I am telling your parents. (Also, for any of you out here wondering if I ever gave these kids pills FUCK TO THE NO!!! I sure as fuck wasn't about to get that started.)
3. Don't bother other customers with it.

I told them that as long as they kept it cool and followed those rules I didn't give a shit. They could smoke in blockbuster parking lot any time they wanted.

Now for those of you who are about to give me shit let me explain something. I didn't want these kids getting a fucking drug charge or worse over something as benign as pot. This way back before even Colorado thought about legalizing it so, the charges were steeper than they are now.",1546809771.0

Have you ever met, or dealt with, a plug that had literally no business being a plug? I mean you seen some of the shit they did and you wonder how they haven't been caught?

Let me tell you about one of mine.

This stupid bitch was like sixty something and dumber than a bag of hammers. First of all, they would always have at least 5 to 6 cars in their driveway. This might be something you could do occasionally but, damn near everyday doesn't make you look like a plug at all. Then, after you found a place to park and went inside it looked like a goddamn waiting room. You would sit in here living room/kitchen and wait for her to call you up stairs. Of course, the conversations going on down there were about what the came here to get. So, if anyone happened to record ANYTHING they could very well hang the whole room. (Someone did this and I am getting to that keep reading)

But letting this shit go on wasn't even the stupidest. This mother fucker was basically a pharmacy. She made bank but, then she would give said ""bank"" to her ""boyfriend over seas who had all this money but, needed her to send him money for a plane ticket home"" or ""Nigerian princes"" What's more, she had one son that weighed every bit of 800lbs and had never seen his own dick let alone a vagina. So, a friend of a friend sets him up with this bitch that has two mean ass kids. Heres the thing with that. All she cared about was money and/or drugs. So, guess what she would threaten to do if he wouldn't give her any money or said ""Kick rocks"" cause he was tired of her shit? Start recording people, people who thought they were to ""Acquire said goods"" and had no baring on anything going on over there. I mean, I saw this stupid bitch sitting across from the drive way recording people. All of this so she would have something to hold over the sons head if he ever tried to get rid of her. Oh, but she wasn't done yet... Her two dumb ass kids were telling the school system what was going on over there. This place was raided at least two times that I can remember hearing about.

But, wait there's more...

She gets her ex-con cousin to move in with her who is required to have random visits from his parole officer. This cousin of hers was also still balls deep into his own game. So now you have all this shit going on among the plugging! And, no, it really didn't stop people from coming over there. Business might have dropped a little, but people still kept going over there. I myself quit going over there when I heard about people being pulled over as the left her street.

Not to mention after awhile the stupid bitch started playing favorites. This happened a lot with other plugs I know. When I first got into this I always thought it was whoever had the money. Just tell you how stupid she was with this: my grand mother passed away a few years ago and left be a decent chunk of change. I call up this dumb ass plug and say ""I got 3 grand and I want whatever you got"" (Also, she had known me for a few years at this point so it wasn't like she had known me a month and I was trying to buy her out) And the dumb mother fucker comes back with ""I got other people to sell too"" and wouldn't sell me shit. What had happened she was selling everything to these well off mother fuckers who were paying 10 per back when the standard was 6. 

Safe to say I got away from this doofy bitch before anything really bad happened....",1546794334.0
