But now i have intense cravings for slamming blow since i get super pure shit and its almost harder on the mental cravings then H (minus the intense physical draw when youre dopesick but thats a different beast) what I'm struggling with basically is maintaining more than a week of not using light or dark. Since I'm not dopesick anymore the H pull is manageable but i seriously struggle with the blow which seems so odd. Anyone else switch from the dark side to the light side and share this experience? Or would anyone who regularly slams coke like to chat about our experiences? I didn't want to post this in  r/cocaine bc i feel like those dudes dont f with needles like we do in r/opiates. Feel free to just downvote me tho if i sound stupid af maybe I am but this is something so new to me since i started to iv snow.

Tldr; pretty much beat dope but now I'm regularly slamming coke and it's almost harder to control the urges. Anyone wanna talk bout this?",1550902864.0
atsb6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atsb6i/ibogaine_to_quit_heroin_long_read_but_i_think/,0,https://redd.it/atsb6i,L1M1ke,Ibogaine to quit heroin (long read but I think worth it for anyone wanting to try it or know what it does),"I‚Äôve been seeing more and more stories of people using ibogaine to get off of opiates and it really has intrigued me in a big way. I just have a few things I‚Äôm not sure of yet. 

So my addiction is due to chronic pain that started with prescriptions and then street oxy 30s until my tolerance reached close to 150$/dose once a day, clearly not sustainable. Also the oxy stopped working at that dose and I was very depressed stuck in bed for months because of my pain and addiction . I wasn‚Äôt making much money at the time either to afford it so I switched to sniffing dope. 

I did that for about 3 weeks, it was much cheaper but barely did anything to me. No high just some pain relief and still pretty depressed. Then I tried IV heroin. It seemed to do the trick. I only got high for about 30 min from it then complete relaxation for a few hours. But it took me out of my funk. I was no longer depressed. And my pain was gone. 

I have been doing this now for the past 3 weeks maybe 4 every day 2-4 doses a day. I also started working again here and there when I can get work w friends. Now I know this is not something i can do forever. The health risks the money, everything about it just isn‚Äôt good for me except for the now of pain relief and depression free. I then came across a post here on ibogaine. Someone did a flood dose at home alone had an amazing trip reliving their life and bad decisions, their childhood ,  and shown the way to live a happy healthy life, and said he experienced ‚Äú2 years of therapy in 2 days‚Äù something I drastically need! He now is free of his opiate addiction, doesn‚Äôt smoke or drink either now and experienced zero WDs.

I‚Äôve seen a joe Rogan episode on it awhile ago but didn‚Äôt think much of it. Now that I‚Äôve read some trip reports I know it‚Äôs something I need. Now a facility costs anywhere between 3-9000$ to attend. They monitor your vitals, give the tests needed like blood tests and ekgs to see if your heart and organs are healthy enough for a flood dose. 

Now even 3k is a lot of money for me right now. I did just land a new job today making decent money but still will be hard to save while paying for my addiction daily. So I‚Äôm stuck on wanting to it at home with a trip sitter (I would get an ekg and blood tests from dr just like they would do at the clinics) I‚Äôm also on cymbalta which I was told need to be off of 2-3 weeks, no problem there. Also my dope has fent in it so I need to figure out what to do about that. At the facilities they give you morphine injections to get you off the street dope before giving the ibogaine. 

Now here‚Äôs my biggest issue. Once I do the ibogaine weather it be at home or at a facility. I‚Äôm gonna be stuck with my chronic pain. My back is completely destroyed where I can barely move around for a few hours without being in excruciating pain. I‚Äôm thinking pain management but from my experience anything short of IV morphine is gonna do the trick so I‚Äôm scared of relapsing for the pain only. I spoke to a bunch of people today that run these places also some people that sell it privately to do alone but couldn‚Äôt really help me with my pain issues. I am thinking a lot of exercise like yoga could very much help me as well. 

Anyway if anyone has any tips pointers or ideas or even their own experiences with ibogaine I would love to hear about it!  I‚Äôm leaning towards a facility to be safe and they‚Äôre mostly all in tropical destinations so it would be like a mini vacation as well. Thanks for reading and hope to get some feedback here!

I have been using for a while, but got off methadone and got off of everything early summer 2017 and dabbled a little bit but not much until about 3-4 months ago. Since then I started doing heroin again, total secret, and have been pretty successful at ‚Äúchipping‚Äù that is doing it just enough to not get sick, keeping my tolerance low through breaks and stuff. 

Recently, however, I have been getting much stronger stuff and there have been a lot of frightening moments. I have been waking up face down or in other weird positions, and just 3 days ago I woke up covered in blood all over my face and my floor, I had (overdosed and) fallen and cut open my chin covering literally my whole face with blood as I lay in it for 15-20 minutes before waking up. I had to get stitches so I I told my family I just slipped on the ice, but the reality was much more concerning. Other less dramatic events have also happened including today, where I woke up in my own vomit clearly in the process of aspiration and I am now trying clear out all the food from my nose and throat. 

It‚Äôs just very frightening for me and I don‚Äôt want to die but I also don‚Äôt want to stop. Thank you for letting me say this as I have no where else to be honest about this shit and it‚Äôs fucking scary.

Hey fam,

I knwo this is of topic but you are the only decent opinions out there. So i have had an on/off love interest over the last few years. She has seen me in the depths of addiction and also been addicted to opiates herself. However doing like our third run of it I lost my father. I really felt like she did not realize or appreciate how huge a loss it is and was for me. We ended up arguing alot and broke up. Here it is over a year later (havent' even gotten laid in that year) and come to find out she fucked and old friend of mine from high school while we were broken up...I never really wanted to break up i just wanted her to appreciate how deep losing your father boss and business partner was a pretty young age. I was and stil am devistated. However i'm taking this fling she had pretty hard. Which is totally not like me. I have been with probably 6 times as many women as she has men...but this really bothers me...I have cleaned up my act as it was when we were dating before but even more so recently in the last year. I have begun to consider marriage and a family and maybe not folliowing my families advice as a prenup if it ever comes to that....I just don't know. Im about to turn 30. I love this girl. she is 26. She loves me i think and says it was never about that but she is hesitatnt to get backk together because her parents don't exactly approve. Go figure right...

I am ready to either make this happen or end it once and for all (even tho its not even a thing yet) I just don't know what to do. I have tried to move on. I have told her how i felt some urgency....She doesnt seem to get it. Im pretty decent looking, have a nice vehicle, a legitimate business, working on a hosue part but a lot is looking up....whats yalls opinions?

Thanks my ninjas

When I went with Bob we used to always complain about the wait time (sometimes hours) but say he made it up in quality and quantity. It always seemed overweight and always a bunch of little pebbles or rocks and little to no powder. I was so relieved when he introduced me to the plug because I was tired of the game... driving 30 minutes southeast to get Bob, pick him up and take him 30 minutes north to meet the plug and wait for at least 45 minutes and then get well, take Bob back home and drive back to my house. The whole commute took at least 2 hours not even considering waiting for the plug which... he sucks with time. We used to wonder why the packs were so fat and wonder if he weighed them. Is it because he knows he's going to make money or is he just so fucked up he doesn't care? But lately I can tell he does weigh because his grams are 1.03 on a scientific scale calibrated to the MG. Like he was trying to be exact as possible.

What do I do man. It's like when I was spending less (40,60, 80) I was getting more. I was wondering, maybe he's worried I'm selling it and is cutting it with fiber? He tells me to be careful everytime its funny because my tolerance is so high I want to say chill dude I shoot .1 shots. Or did he literally do this purposely, like reel me in with good product and quality to see if I was hooked and then started selling me cut shit?

So my middle man Bob said the way he got the price down was by buying less. He actually told the plug that he was going to stop using. I didn't understand this or the logic at all but he said that the plug preferred he stopped using because then he would bring the plug more customers. Whereas when he was using he wasnt bringing enough I guess. 

Well I'm bringing this guy plenty of money and wondered if maybe that's it? Maybe he thinks mommy and daddy is supplying all my fucking money and that I'm gonna buy no matter what? No.

I'm so fucking pissed.

A pistol-packing pot grower with a zipper for a mouth called Big Bag was making a move from out on the mesa into town. He intended to capitalize on the isolated heroin market there. We rode with him and his leather-skinned girlfriend on the back roads down to another small town for ounces of heroin, and when we got back to town Danielle and I used our network of junkies to sell his dope. It wasn‚Äôt a week before we ripped him off for a bunch of dope. He offered anyone in town a $50 bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. 

We shorted other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.

Danielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Klonopin and an SSI check available on the first. We shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. She left me freezing at the gas station at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason.  Later in the night, we went to the ER looking for meds.

Her Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino for half smoked butts several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy‚Äôs spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood, to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn‚Äôt share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring made from an old long board. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.",1550883024.0

 For example if I were to use at 8pm tonight, which would be 36 hours after last sub, and use til 8 am tomorrow. Would I need to wait til 8 am or proper shitty feeling according to the COWS scale before getting back on the subs and not get PWD?

I graduated with my degree in May of last year and moved half away across to the country to insure I wouldn't have access to opiates anymore.

Feb 11th 2019 marked my first year of being sober. I now work a boring but easy insurance job, I'm saving money, investing in cryptocurrency, and I live close to family which is a blessing. I no longer party anymore, I rarely go out on the weekends because social drinking sucks without drugs, and I also spend a lot of spare time doing hobbies, like designing clothes. My life is a very average, boring, post-grad lifestyle as one can imagine.  


With all that being said.... life fucking sucks if I am being totally honest with myself. I am bored to death and I am developing this fear of growing old and losing the will to enjoy life. How the fuck do sober people enjoy life? I have weekly cravings for erotic behavior. Its been a year of sobriety and I still want to shove roxi up my nose, party my ass off on the weekend and have one-night stands. I just have to keep forcing myself to abstain.  


I lived an extreme life style from ages 18-22 and I am trying my hardest to adjust to whatever a ""normal"" life is suppose to be and it is depressing me.

Any other sober people out there know this feeling I am going through?",1550859254.0

I took 1 mg Suboxone this morning in desperation. Is this enough to block the effects of oxycodone later in the day?

I'm not looking to get high, I just want pain relief so if that will still happen when the Suboxone is in play, I'm okay with it.

Edit: I'm high and forgot the sentence that was the reason for this post. The urine test is because I'm going to get tested for pain management purposes and was wondering if that amount of suboxone would likely stay in my system as long as a higher dose.

atk84h,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atk84h/when_i_was_shot/,38,https://redd.it/atk84h,fuzzmaster_flex,When I was shot,"When he pulled the gun from his waistband all I could think was, ‚Äúfinally‚Äù, followed by curiosity about what kind of pistol this semi-rural teenager might have. Was it a shitty $100 Hi-Point that might misfire, giving me a chance to run, or fight? Or was it a nicer Glock or Taurus that had already been used in a murder and sold on cheap as a ‚Äúthrow-away piece‚Äù? Unfortunately since it was a generic mid-size black pistol and I‚Äôm no expert, I had no idea. I just knew, for a near certainty that I was getting shot that hot and sticky Georgia afternoon.
I was new to town. New to the state in fact, having just driven a laden-down U-Haul from a central Midwestern state to a mid-size town an hour or so south of Atlanta to live with my sister and her boyfriend at the time. I was going there to get clean, as my parents couldn‚Äôt take the stealing, lying, and coopting of their car without permission any longer. I drove 16 hours straight, stopping every four hours or so to shoot up my dwindling supply of heroin, so as to not get sick during the drive. I traded off the inevitable violent sickness comprised of frequent vomiting, diarrhea, and severe RLS among other symptoms for a dangerous game of semi-nodding at the wheel. A mix of heroin and simple sleep deprivation had me swerving out of my lane from time to time, meaning that I and everyone around me were very lucky that I didn‚Äôt run off the road or crash into someone innocent and unsuspecting, let alone the danger and possibility of a DUI, reckless driving, and/or possession charge. I wasn‚Äôt a stupid or oblivious junky, these thoughts more than crossed my mind, in fact they were near constant, I simply pushed them to the side for the time. Heroin has a way of making all of one‚Äôs worries fade into the background. I listened to Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on tape as I drove, but my eyes were glued to my rear-view mirror when they weren‚Äôt peeled for State Troopers on the side of the road ahead of me.
A junkie‚Äôs life is a rollercoaster, the hills consisting of having enough drug(s) of their choice to get them through till the morning, although saving that last shot or rock until they wake up is monumentally difficult, as one wakes up every two hours thinking ‚Äúis it time yet?, hopefully using what little willpower they still possess to wait a little longer. A good comparison would be having a glass of nice cold water on your bedside table, and you wake up over and over totally parched, tongue stuck to the roof of your mouth, throat sore, but if you drink the water (and you have to drink it all at once to feel satisfied) you know you won‚Äôt be able to acquire another drink until you hustle up another $20-100. Once the drugs are gone, desperation sets in quickly, followed by a junkie‚Äôs dips and lows, usually consisting initially of middle-manning for friends and strangers to make a percentage, risking a ‚Äùdistribution‚Äù charge, though soon enough a day comes where nobody needs anything and sickness sets in. As the dope-sickness sets in, though primarily psychological and only mildly physical at first, more extreme ideas form. You ask family for money for ‚Äúrent‚Äù and ‚Äúfood‚Äù, but they are tired of enabling and say they are sorry, but no. So you think of who you could rob, or do a return scam at a big box store, risking a theft or shoplifting charge, but being sick, who cares? You would pawn something but your apartment has been bare of anything of worth for months; televisions, game systems, computers, musical instruments and paraphernalia, the prized hunting shotgun that your Grandfather bought you when you were sixteen and you swore you would possess till you died. You cried after you sold the shotgun, but at least your Grandfather is dead and can no longer feel disappointed that his only grandson is such a fuckup, and at least you got high for two days from the cash after selling it. Two days of numb for a lifetime of shame and regret‚Ä¶should you just kill yourself? 
You could overdose on purpose so it looks like a stupid accident, or lay in front of a train so that there is no chance of survival. You don‚Äôt want to scar the train conductor though, as you have some humanity and a shred of empathy left, at least while high or ‚Äúwell‚Äù (not sick but not fucked up), although that fades the sicker and more desperate you get. People say that dope-sickness Is like the worst flu you‚Äôve ever had combined with cravings and restless leg/arm syndrome, but it is worse. Your humanity is stripped away, leaving nothing but a wretched, sweating, vomiting, shitting, shell with little to no empathy left. It makes it so easy to snatch a purse, raid Grandmas medicine cabinet or bedroom‚Ä¶she has to have something good! She probably actually does, but it was hidden a long time ago, after your parents called all the direct family to gossip and warn against letting the black sheep roam freely, particularly in the house. 
Even with all the justified restrictions, lack of trust/vigilant surveillance, and tough love, a junky finds a way to get a fix. Long term opiate abuse (which both oxycodone and heroin are) rewires the brain, making getting a opiates more important than anything else, including food, shelter, family, sex, everything. Personally I hate lying. It makes me feel bad, it complicated things, and some lies are just so outlandish that all you can think is, ‚Äúam I really trying to say my track marks are from scratching bug bites, what the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù, but you‚Äôre too deep at that point so you double down. Maybe you get angry that the person doesn‚Äôt immediately believe your stupid story while you nod out mid-sentence, or you try to flip it on our accuser, ‚Äúyou drink a bottle of wine a day and you‚Äôre accusing me of relapsing because my pupils are small, and I was in the bathroom for twenty minutes?! How dare you!‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWhat, I can‚Äôt just be in a good mood?! You want me to be depressed and just not talk?‚Äù as you babble about inappropriate things to extended family. I turned into a prolific liar, lying to my amazing supportive parents about everything, day and night: where I was going and why, who with, about money, theft (yes, I stole from my parents and can never take it back, while pretending they had lost the item and were being crazy), what I was on and when, how I felt mentally and physical, how I ingested my drugs, future plans (I had none and hoped to die unexpectedly, hence my genuine lack of fear and bravado in the face of a gun pointed at my chest). I never used to be a liar, and hate doing it sober, but when dope is involved, lying is second nature. You tell yourself that it‚Äôs to protect loved ones, but as everything is obscured in a cloud of apathy and drugs, the only thing you want to protect is your drugs. Staying out of jail so that you don‚Äôt have to detox is a secondary concern and a drug addict will take insane risks that a sober person would never consider a possibility. 
After the gun had been pulled on me all I could think, and ended up saying, was, ‚ÄúFinally. Please do it, but aim for the head dude.‚Äù And the young man (I found out later he was 19 with priors) stared at me, seemingly flabbergasted and at a loss for words in the face of a white boy not scared of his gun, perhaps just surprised his robbery wasn‚Äôt going to plan and not ready for outright murder. He compromised by shooting me in the upper thigh, hoping that that would make me realize he was serious, but I laughed in his face, pointed at my head, and said, ‚Äúno bro, I said shoot me right here, I‚Äôm for real, fucking do it‚Äù. The thigh shot was thankfully a through and through with no artery or bone damage and at the time I only felt pressure, accompanied by the smell of cordite and the lingering ringing in my right ear, having had a 9mm handgun discharged a foot away from my head in the front seat of my rented U-Haul. Once again he stared at me for a few seconds, perhaps wondering if this was worth the effort and possible criminal charges, but I believe that my taunting and the fact that he had gone so far already prompted him to finish the job. Or at least try to, seeing as how I watched him angle the pistol up a few inches and discharge it a second time into my upper right chest, once again from about a foot and a half away, resulting not only in the normal damage associated with a gunshot wound to the abdomen, but what the doctors described as ‚Äúan explosive gunshot wound‚Äù, meaning from what I understand that the shots were close enough that they caused hydrostatic shock, bursting blood vessels from pressure and incurring extra damage.
After being shot the second time, all I could do is half-double over and moan. No tears, no screaming, no shock (movies and TV lied to me, I was hoping for it and it never came.) and definitely no attempting to walk or drive for help. As he jumped from the vehicle, taking my mostly empty, excepting a decent pocket knife, backpack with him, I wrestled him for it with my working arm for no reason other than stubbornness, but lost the tug of war and off he went. He never got the cash he wanted, the $100 that was worth more than my life, so I guess I win? All I could do was use the phone I had hidden under my leg just in case something like this happened, as I felt a robbery was imminent, but ignored all red flags with dope sickness wracking my body and destroying all logic and reason. Maybe I wished to die, but I called 911 all the same. As I sat hunched over, bleeding and groaning, on the phone with local emergency dispatch trying to get them to send an ambulance to my pathetic near-cadaver, the shooter was apparently opening the back of the U-Haul. 
After opening that rolling shutter door he must have been disappointed by the barren and dusty interior of the truck, which contained only a 2-wheel trolley, so he left the door open, ditched the bag, and disappeared. He, according to law enforcement, then went around the ‚Äòhood bragging about killing a cop. Two problems; I‚Äôm not and never have been a cop, just a younger white male Midwesterner. I believe his downfall was simple hubris, as it has been many men, as he was snitched on by multiple people in his neighborhood. I ended up in the ICU, unable to eat, barely able to breathe on my own (thank God since breathing tubes are awful especially if one is awake and aware), and not able to move much more than my feet and arms, and even that hurt. I was in terrible pain and one 12-year veteran nurse told me I was on the highest amount of narcotic painkillers he had ever seen, in part to stop my withdrawal symptoms. I had admitted my past and was on day four of detoxing at home (withdrawal from a serious opiate addiction Is roughly 7 days of hell, followed by 2-3 weeks of very low energy, soreness, and insomnia, so I was in the worst of it when I went out trying to cold cop, and I admit and accept full responsibility for putting myself in the situation that precipitated events) The shooter was eventually arrested and sentenced roughly 14 months later to 15yrs plus 10 or so of probation. He didn‚Äôt have to do what he did but I personally believe that he was desperate, living in a terrible environment with no money, and felt backed into a corner in a way unique to men, and black men in his position especially, feeling the need to command respect to survive. It is almost certain that he told some ‚Äúfriend‚Äù that his plan was to rob me, and if he came back empty handed, or without having ‚Äúkilled‚Äù me, he would be ridiculed and looked down on. He may not even be a bad guy deep down, everyone was innocent once. To be fair, he refused to shoot me in the head, and whether that was cowardice, squeamishness, mercy, or some misguided attempt to avoid certain charges, the results were the same. Maybe he was right, he never got Attempted Murder, so maybe he knew something I didn‚Äôt. I hope he can be one of those that exits prison ‚Äúreformed‚Äù and we can have a coffee. On the other hand, he may be a still-violent recidivist. I don‚Äôt judge, as I‚Äôve done more than enough to feel terrible about. Life isn‚Äôt fair, but we have to deal with it.
After being shot in the chest, which I later learned resulted in: a collapsed lung, 2 broken ribs, a partially destroyed and temporarily non-functioning kidney, a severely damaged duodenum (leads from stomach to intestines, meaning no food for 9+ weeks, which was excruciating), a third of my liver being destroyed, part of my small intestine being removed, multiple surgeries, massive blood loss and a total of around 2 months in the hospital, including learning to walk again. In the ICU I couldn‚Äôt even turn myself, which meant the overworked nurses had to turn me every two hours. The pain was honestly mind-blowing and I had a 6‚Äùx9‚Äù open incision on my stomach for around a week waiting for another surgery, and the dressing changing process on the wound-vac was transcendently unenjoyable. I was unsuspectingly taken one day, flipped onto my huge incision, and held down while a hole was literally drilled into my back to insert a urine collection bag into my right kidney, as my kidney-bladder ureter was all but obliterated. My theory is that the doctors and techs assumed I was ‚Äúout‚Äù during the procedure, but I most assuredly was not. Dozens of botched and successful IVs were administered, 2 of them directly into my leg bones when I was too dehydrated after being shot.
After calling 911 I had to wait for around five minutes for emergency personnel to reach me as I sat in the driver‚Äôs seat of my U-Haul, still on the phone with the emergency dispatcher, bleeding profusely. She told me in a slight Southern accent that I would be okay, and to hold on, the ambulance would be there soon. She asked me where I was but I was new to town, so all I could tell her was ‚Äúthe ghetto area‚Äù of the town I had moved to four days prior. I don‚Äôt know if that was good enough, or if they were able to trace the general area that my call had originated from, but as I moaned into the phone, each breath becoming more labored, I started to hear sirens. I laid on the horn for as long as the strength in my arm held out, and contemplated the fact that bullets are hot, as I could feel the burn of it deep in my chest, shining through the rest of the pain.
The first emergency responder to arrive was a policeman, who stepped out of his cruiser with his gun drawn and shouted at me to put my hands out the window. I noticed that the window was broken as glass crumbled away when I shakily reached out to show that I didn‚Äôt have a gun. I was curious why the window had shattered as one bullet was still in me and the other was angled towards the floor. This was also the first time I noticed how severely I was bleeding, as I saw that my arm was painted red from being tucked against my chest wound, which had now soaked my favorite shirt, while the bullet holes in my leg had soaked my shorts. Not that it mattered, as I had also shit myself at some point, a combination of withdrawal-induced diarrhea combined with shock and pain making my situation even more pathetic. The policeman quickly realized I posed no threat and came to the door, asking me where I was hurt around the same time that an ambulance arrived, and things became hectic quickly.
One of the bright red flags that I had ignored was when I was told to turn into a rundown, seemingly abandoned house‚Äôs gravel driveway, which made rolling a stretcher to me not possible. This meant that two paramedics had to support me as we walked 30 feet or so to the back of the ambulance parked nearby, this should have sucked more than I remember, but by that point my world was pain, regardless of specifics, and I just focused on attempting to catch a breath with my one lung. I begged for pain meds once I was laid on the stretcher, and as perverse as it sounds I actually felt some sort of optimism that my withdrawal would be gone if they gave me enough fentanyl, but the four medics working around me with a kind of controlled chaos said that I couldn‚Äôt be given any pain medication until they stabilized my blood pressure. Personally, I couldn‚Äôt have cared less about my blood pressure, but I knew they were trying to save my life, and as worthless and wretched as I felt, I figured I‚Äôd let them do their thing. I had to admit that I was a withdrawing heroin addict, partially because all four medics failed to place IVs up and down both arms, constituting upwards of 12 sticks, and also because I hoped for a higher dose of whatever drug they would eventually give me.

So, I have heard and read a fair amount of information about the neurobiology of addiction. Granted this is not my field, but the idea is something like this:

Your brain is kind of like an air conditioning system. But instead of temperature sensors, it uses neurotransmitters to control what happens and how you feel.

Drugs mess up these sensors. Your brain gets whacked. You set the temperature to be 72 degrees, but it ends up being 40. 

The plans for this system are hard wired into your dna, the mysterious substance that is like computer code for life.

As we all know from watching the X-Men, the only thing that can change your dna is mutation by cosmic rays, etc.

BUT ‚Äì it turns out that maybe your dna can be changed by the environment.

What? But X-men issue 193 clearly states that only ‚Ä¶.

Yes, yes my child. Be calm. It will be ok.

It turns out that there is a science called epigenetics, which is really even more complicated than regular genetics, which trust me, is a bitch to begin with.

It is sort of about how the environment can affect heredity, but really quick. Meaning like your kid, not thousands of generations from now.

But, didn‚Äôt we figure out that evolution takes a really long time?

Yes, about that. Like politics, it seems like the answer is yes and no.

It maybe is well established that people with addiction in the family run a greater risk of having problems. True?

But what about those clean cut kids that see their drunk parents raising hell and swear they will never become alcoholics? 

Pretty common and apparently true. Should they not become addicted when they taste that sacramental wine?

What if I told you that some science guys gave a single generation of rats a one-time shot of an opiate?

What if I told you that the next generation of rats were not as vulnerable to opiate addiction?

Well, you might say. Rats are just stupid like that cause if I could get free dope I would be all over it.

You might be right. However, I am now going to post a link to this article so you can decide for yourself.

atfoqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atfoqj/not_opioid_related_but_you_guys_are_the_best_just/,9,https://redd.it/atfoqj,OpiatedMinds,"Not opioid related but you guys are the best, just wanted to talk about protecting your heart and using cocaine.","Crossposting here because I did this post to r/cocaine, and got just about what I expected (""just sniff it"", ""what's wrong with you"", etc...), and from what I hear you guys saying about the kids over at r/drugs, I'm not even gonna bother posting just to get flamed... (maybe drug nerds could help though - any ideas you guys and gals, I'd be happy to hear 'em). 

I feel like here at home (r/opiates, my home on reddit), that this would be the best spot to post this question, especially since we got some medical professionals here as well as a bunch of other folks who know pharmacology and physiology and harm reduction at a high level, not even for money or a career, but just because they are awesome human beings with an insatiable appetite for knowledge, and plenty of heart to go along with it, as evidenced by all of the folks willing to take the time and effort to pass along good & accurate harm reduction information, as well as taking part in advanced and deeper opioid and even general drug discussion.

On to the topic at hand, we all know that cocaine has a very strong effect on the cardiovascular system. It can cause side effects that can be short term, and merely bothersome or scary (palpitations or pain), or potentially fatal (dangerous or deadly arrhythmias or cardiac infarct or arrest). There are also long term issues associated with cocaine abuse, things like enlarged heart from long term heavy use overworking the heart. And let's not forget other fun things like stroke and seizure, PE and more, these things would be good to avoid as well if at all possible.

Obviously the best most safest thing is to not use cocaine at all, especially not smoking or injecting it. I understand it is a hard drug with many hazards. I choose to use at my own risk and to my own potential detriment, and though in ways that is foolish, I am not so shortsighted with a deathwish that I wouldn't like to be as careful as I can be in such a dangerous risky endeavour, and if there might be ways to make something inherently dangerous just slightly more safe, I'd love to hear it! 

I like to smoke or shoot my coke, and no denying after a good bellringer my heart will start skipping a beat here and there, and it freaks me out. I sometimes wonder what the chance is that it could fall into some dangerous or fatal rhythm. If I knew it was harmless, that would greatly ease my mind, and truth be told if palpitations start I slow down and wait, and they have never gone south on me, though I feel them and it scares the shit out of me. The palpitations don't present with pain, I wonder if there are any vitamins or supplements I could take that would prevent this from occurring at all. I don't drink alcohol while using to avoid cocaethylene and it's increased cardiotoxicity. I also try to wait a good amount of time in between doses. As hard as it is to wait, with the fast half-life of coke I feel like waiting a while (20-60 minutes) between hits gives your body time to break down the dose so that successive doses don't accumulate and fuck with the heart. Oh not to mention waiting makes the difference between a huge hit being shitty or waiting and having the second hit of the day be nearly as good as the first.

So as there are benzos that will help protect against seizures caused by cocaine (overdose?), is there anything comparable one could take that would help insulate the heart from the negative effects caused by cocaine? Anything to help buffer the areas in which cocaine causes issues. For example I read about cocaine causing problems for the heart because of its affect on sodium channels. Now this is where things go way beyond my level of knowledge and comprehension. I can read about how sodium channels work in the heart, and come to understand how cocaine affects this system and the resulting implications, but I don't really have a grasp on what could be done pharmacologically to mitigate the negative and dangerous side effects of cocaine on the cardiovascuar system (if anything at all). I wonder if beta blockers might be an idea? The problem is, this is all hypothetical, and even if there was a good idea, it would never have been explicitly tested along with cocaine for the purpose of seeing it's effects on cocaine in vitro, and this would probably be true of any drug that might help offset the troublesome burden cocaine puts on the heart at higher doses. So there are interactions and other things to be worried about, not to mention even if something like say a beta blocker would be considered to be pretty safe to take and then use cocaine with, and even if it would at least cause no harm at best help reduce cardio impact, it wouldn't really be accessible for that purpose (though it could surely be procured by someone resourceful and motivated enough).

So I'd love to hear what all y'all think, any tips and ideas you guys have. Like I said my best idea is to wait a long time between hits, allowing your body to clear the coke so that it doesn't build up to dangerous levels, and another plus here is that your brain gets a chance to replete some of its neurochemicals and power back up so the next hit is a real bellringer instead of a brain-frier. Also helps make your stuff last longer and makes you less of a fiend. I found that opiates really helps in this regard, where you can do a blast and just chill afterwards, without opiates I'd be crawling the walls salivating staring at the next hit, my watch, and the stem, contemplating saying ""fuck it I'll take the chance on the ole' ticker"".

I would think staying hydrated would probably be a great idea in regards to helping prevent any serious cardiovascular complications from cocaine use. Beyond that just normal common sense stuff, like you would surely be better & less susceptible to dangerous heart scares due to coke if you have a healthy diet, healthy weight, regular cardio exercise, and say a clean bill of health (no heart problems hereditary, congenital, etc).

I also feel like smoking crack or freebase is far safer than using IV... anyone who has ever shot coke and smoked crack knows that while the perfect dose IV is the best way to experience cocaine, smoking a fat rock of some good base comes in a very close second... as long as you have decent product, and most importantly the right equipment (proper stem + chore) and technique... then you can get a righteous bellringer from smoking every single time. The reason I feel smoking is safer is because quality can vary widely with powder, anyone that's ever overdone it on a shot knows what I mean. One time I hit a shot of good coke, and it came on fast and strong, and it went immediately past bellringer to a territory known as pure terror... I was frightened as I felt like surely I had done too much and I was going to die... I'll never forget that, because as much as I love everything about shooting (the way you taste it, the way it comes up slow and smooth and steady), it's super easy to miss that sweet sweet spot. I have mostly memories of disappointment, shots that were weak and left much to be desired. Then I have that one memory of the time I overshot the mark and thought for sure I was gonna die. Not too often did I get it just right, and the way my veins are now it's a crime against myself to binge on shooting coke, I need those few remaining spots for dope). But when you smoke it is way easier to get a solid dose every time, if you didn't quite get there or your technique kind of sucks you can just follow up the first hit with a second. And this might not hold true if you had some like 99% pure freebase, but in my experience I have never overdone it on a smoked hit, even smoking a big fat (baby tooth) sized rock of some fire, the times it started coming on a little intense I just blew out a huge cloud instead of holding it in, and expelling some of your dose is an option you do not have when you inject, another safety plus check mark in the box for smoking being safer. For the experts and pros out there though, I will admit there is one problem I know of that smoking causes (at least in my experience) that IV use does not, and that is the physical act of taking the hit combined with the drug effects potentially adding additional stress on the heart. So here goes for my little theory: When you inject a dose, your heart rate will increase, and as it's a stimulant your respiration/breathing rate will increase, you will breath quickly, and I would assume your heart will be hungry for this extra oxygen as it's rate increases from the cocaine. One thing I have noticed from smoking that concerns me a little is that when you take a huge hit and hold it in, your heart starts pretty quickly jackhammering, and holding your breath might deprive it of some of the precious oxygen it is now demanding more of. Whether this could add to the danger of cocaine use or not I don't know, I try to not be shy or stingy, and I take a big hit and instead of holding it in until my heart explodes I just slowly breath it out... still seems to get me there.

Anyways I'd love to see what you guys think, I know this isn't opioid related but many of you fine folks use all manner of drugs, and I know cocaine is a pretty popular one around here. I really couldn't think of a better place to post it, and I was sorry I posted it over in r/cocaine before I tried here, I guess I thought I'd give it a fair shot but to be fair they don't have anywhere near the community we got here, they are pretty 2 dimensional over there.

So as he‚Äôs parked on the street, I‚Äôm standing outside the driver side window talking with him. I noticed a set of headlights behind me just kinda creepin... you know, the cop creep routine. 

As he pulls up to the side of us, he asks how and what we are doing. Steve and I both replied at the same time that I was meeting with him to get some money from him. The cop then shone his spotlight on us as Steve was handing me the money. Now, I just took a dab before this all happened so I‚Äôm sure I looked pretty high. Not to mention Steve: sores on his face, pale as fuck, the whole nine. The cop continued down the street as Steve and I parted ways

Why didn‚Äôt I just invite him and his friends in the truck to come upstairs for a minute? Or at least stay and talk to him til the cop was gone?

I‚Äôm kinda trippin right now. Just the other day I had to tell Steve that if he was gonna serve me any dope to my house, to bring just my dope and no cash. I live downtown in a fairly big city on the west coast, so I‚Äôm sure you can imagine the police activity. I already know he got pulled over, and most likely fucked with cause he‚Äôs on probation. I just hope to god he took my advice and left any dope or cash he wasn‚Äôt bringing to me at home. Although he did just reup.

atbwsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atbwsc/the_best_brown_ive_ever_had/,0,https://redd.it/atbwsc,70uGofSubs,The best brown I've ever had,"Well... A year ago I was on rehab... I had been there for a month and a half and was so sure I was gonna quit forever. I got out a month and a half later and lasted only 3 months clean. My brother introduced me to hydrocodone and dillies and that was it, back to gear.  

Since I spent 6 months without calling my plug, he stopped selling and after a couple of weeks he called  me back and said he'd found his contact again but this shit had changed for something I had never seen before. When you cooked it, it cristalized in a very strange and weird way, I made my shot and if I left it there or took too much to find a vein, it started to become crystal, but if you shake the rig, it would go back to liquid! The most crazy thing I've ever experienced after 12 years of daily usage. It made me nod 5ho, but I had to use a lot.

I kept telling the guy to change the gear and he was always like ""yeah, I'm working on it"". So I went on vacation to the south where my country has the biggest poppy fields and kitchens and eventually ran out of methadone... I spent a bit more than a day withdrawing until I remembered a friend I hadn't talked to in a while was from that city.
I called him and after making sure he had relapsed I asked him for a plug  so he connected me with a guy with a great gear I've never tried before, specially after that shit I was using, but it was expensive...

For you to make an idea, where I'm from I paid about 40 usd for 3 gr, but in this city, I  was paying 40 usd for 1.5gr.

Since I knew this gear was fire, I was willing to pay a bit more, so I talked to this guy and asked him if he could ship it maybe bi-weekly once I traveled back and he agreed. 

After a bit more than a month of me coming back, we arranged for the first shipment and got my gear 2 days later so I spent 2 weeks without calling my regular source and he called me, I told him that I was sorry but I was not buying from him anymore and he kinda freaked out and called me a couple of hours later telling me that he had talked to the higher up and guaranteed that he had changed the gear. I asked him to front me a g to make sure It was really a different Bron and oh boy is it different... It is the bag to the left which is almost white with a grayish tone to it. To the right is the one I bought from a different city, which is a bit more brown. Ithink I haven't tried something this good, at least not in years... I just need half of the amount of the other city's dope to get twice as fucked. I hope this batch never ends...

atbkfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/atbkfl/here_goes_nothing/,3,https://redd.it/atbkfl,idkwhattoputhurr,Here goes nothing,"Well here it goes guys, my very first and hopefully only attempt to kick this habit. This is the first time in the 1.5 years of doing opiates, that I feel like I'm really ready to be done and get off the pills. 

For the first couple of months I did them every once in awhile and sold most all of the ones I came across. My fiance warned me ""don't get addicted to those things. I don't want to deal with an opiate addict"", but I wouldn't get addicted! I wouldn't be like everyone else, because I had the will to not get addicted. I could stop whenever I wanted! I was really really wrong and she had to deal with an opiate addict.

Im sure a lot of you go through or have gone through the same shit I have been going through for the last year. The seemingly never ending chase to find oxys or hydros. It never mattered how much I had because eventually that would be gone and I would need more. I would drive over an hour in the middle of the night just to get a few 10 mg oxys that wouldnt even make the car ride home with me.

 I threw away hours and hours of my time and thousands of dollars to get high. Its at the point now that I have to spend over $100 a day to keep this habit and its not worth it anymore. I would leave my fiance at home with our 2 kids while she suffered from PPD just to get some pills. I didnt care how mad she got or how much she cried, I was leaving to go get my fix. 

Well today is the first day on my road to recovery. Yesterday I had scheduled an appointment with a psychiatrist and already had my appt today (couldn't believe how fast he got back with me). I started Suboxone to help with being sick from withdrawal. Im hoping to get off of it in a week or so. I dont think I remember what I felt like before I got addicted to pain pills, but I think Suboxone makes me feel normal.

Taking pain pills recreationally was the worst thing I've ever done. Im just glad that I'm stopping before I got in too deep. Wish me luck guys. Im going to need it! I can tell this is going to be a tough road ahead.

So for those of you who don‚Äôt know or haven‚Äôt cared up until this point, I experience chronic pain every day of my life. I had to drop out of school. I‚Äôm in too much of a rut to even do my homeschooling. 

So blah blah blah, chronic pain sob story, tOo yOuNg fOr bAcK pAiN, etc etc.

This is where the frustrating part kicks in.

After dealing with an anesthesiologist who wouldn‚Äôt prescribe more than muscle relaxers, and who told me I should go to physical therapy over and over for 3 years (which I did), we finally decided that when he told me I should go to a therapist to teach me how to use a cane properly, it was time to drop that useless sack of shit.

So now I‚Äôve started to see Mayo Clinic doctors. My pain medicine doctor (literally the title of his branch) wrote me a script for tapentadol because tramadol popped up as [illegal for patients under the age of 21]. 

The irony was not lost on me or the doctor. 

So I left that office pretty much overflowing with joy. The first pain medicine script after all these years of doctors acknowledging that I needed pain meds, but refusing to write them for fear of losing their licenses. 

Went to fill the tapentadol, insurance says we have to get a generic. Problem is, *there is no generic.* So they said they‚Äôll either cover the extended release version, or it‚Äôll be $200 a month out of pocket.

FUCK. INSURANCE.

I could go on a whole tirade against everything insurance is and how far overreaching they are, but I won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm sure you all know that very very well.

So now I‚Äôm waiting to see how this one plays out. Still bedridden. 

If enough of you care I‚Äôll do an update post when things change. Thanks for listening to this directionless post bbysü•∞

TL;DR: After 5 years, was finally prescribed tapentadol for pain, insurance company (none of which are doctors) steps in and overrules the doctor and makes him CHANGE HIS PRESCRIPTION. Waiting to see if I actually get pain meds. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

EDIT 1:

So we called Mayo and told them that the insurance would only cover the extended release, to which they said fine and sent over the script. All was well and good and I was to get my medicine in about an hour.

That‚Äôs when this fucking DIPSHIT of a pharmacist flags the prescription and CALLS MY PARENTS to make sure they were aware of exactly what I was prescribed. 

He then proceeded to fear monger the absolute fuck out of my parents, telling them tapentadol is an END OF LIFE MEDICATION FOR TERMINAL CANCER PATIENTS and that he absolutely WOULD NOT FILL IT.


I AM ABOUT TO GO ON A MURDEROUS FUCKING RAMPAGE. THIS IS FUCKING OUTRAGEOUS. HHOOOOOOLLLY SHIT. AFTER ALL THIS TIME OF BEING DENIED, I FINALLY GET A LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL AND THE FUCKING PHARMACIST FREAKS THE FUCK OUT AND REFUSES TO GIVE ME MY MEDICINE.

So I was injured 6 years ago and was prescribed morphine sulfate 15mg long acting 2x daily and 15mg short acting 3x daily and want to be off. I am going on day 5 cold turkey and have hardly felt any withdrawals compared to what I have in the past. Day 1 and 2 of course sucked but was incrediably mild, like I had a cold...not the awful ""flu"" we all learned is much worse. I was even able to do some yard work (with several breaks).

The first 24-72 hours I took 6mg imodium 3x daily but what I'm convinced saved me from pure hell was lamotrigine, an epileptic anticonvulsant and I dont understand why doctors dont prescibe this more often for detox. I cant find hardly anything online about it helping but heres what I did find:
https://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=pjbs.2009.33.39

I was immediatly convinced by my second dose of it because it's the only thing I did different without anything else aside from imodium.
We all struggle for sleep and its 1 of many reasons it makes it so hard but I slept at least 6-8 every night and had some mad crazy vivid dreams.

They havent done much studies but once you read the results of their lab rat experiment, it makes total sense. It basically stops your cravings (morphine, cocaine, alcohol and others) and blocks certain parts in your brain. It also increases the opioids metabolism if you take it at the same time so I'm assuming it rids your body faster. I started with cutting a quarter of 100mg and every 4-6 hours took it the first day. 2nd day I took a quarter at 6am, another quarter at 12pm, quarter at 4pm and another quarter at 8pm. By day 5 I'm 50mg am and 50mg pm. I've slept all 5 nights, no sweating, no RLS, no fever, etc. Only thing that lingers here or there is a chill down my neck off and on and ridiculous boredom so have been making myself keep busy outside and inside work. I was able to eat normal foods but very thirsty. I'm bored as hell though, I'm sure everyone knows how you think an hour went by and it's only been 5 minutes plus difficult concentrating but hey...I'll take it over the awful sickness. Highly recommend for anyone struggling. I do not suggest you mix this drug with anything else because of interactions (I was fine with small amounts of imodium). This drug is also know to cause serious rashes in some people, such as Steven Johnson syndrome so just be aware and use cautiously because I am by no means a medical professional...just a guy trying to throw a life card at those desperately needing it.

Ok, I am not thinking about crazy arab guys with weapons of mass destruction right now. It is just too early.

Gradually I start feeling coherent, and it is time to get dressed for work,

Do what?

Wait, wait! Is this what I signed up for?

When I was using, I slept till eleven. Soundly.

There was no such thing as an alarm. Nobody called me in the morning. I did not know there was even such a thing as morning. No one I knew could swear that the sun rose in the east or that morning was even real.

Now I know different. I need to make money. I am not sure exactly why this is worth getting up at six, but I must do my duty.

Money is important now. And I can no longer steal, con or scam it up, even though this is something I did almost without conscious effort in the old days.

I realize money can‚Äôt buy happiness. You might think it can, but really it is an illusion. All those friends that are coming over now and hanging out while we play music and talk about cool stuff, and drive to fancy restaurants in our beamers and such, that is not happiness.

It might SEEM like it, but really, I would say  it is more like renting happiness. Unless you really have a ton of money, like rock star money. Then you can totally be happy while you tell everyone how miserable you are. This is a closely guarded secret among famous people. You did not hear it from me.

Now, in the old days, I would just roll out of bed, do my morning shot, and I would instantly be happy. Then I would drink some tequila and be even happier.

But actually, thinking about it, sure, the dope and alcohol seemed to make me happy, but it was only temporary.

The thing was, eventually I would have to confront the truth. I needed more liquor.

Now, thinking about this, you might be thinking, is this guy really serous?

No, I am not. Just the thought of having to go out into my little dope world and deal with the cops, all my wonderful dope boy and junkie friends, the drama and disappointment, is enough for me to put myself in check.

I much prefer the sober life, in which I will go to work and listen to people talk about that latest video on the internet, racism, bullying, and what John did at that bar OMG it was so funny, even though we are not really making fun of him., cause we are nice and we are pc. Rock on sjw.

asxp45,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/asxp45/she_keeps_picking/,13,https://redd.it/asxp45,ASavageLost,She keeps picking.," 

I am smoking a cigarette in the corner of the parking lot the next morning.

Staring at the bushes and the soggy trash in the mud underneath them. There‚Äôs an old paper cup disintegrating back into the pulp it was made from and some kind of pink foam or insulation wadded up in bits next to that. Half of a foldable chair sticks out of the slop. Its metal bars have rusted completely through. A mud-soaked string runs from one end of the mess and disappears into the ground on the other side. I puff on my cigarette. There are buildings over the fence and the chug of trucks in traffic and horns beeping and somewhere in the bleak cityscape my own death cries out to me from a street corner. It is this small and distant, high pitched voice, something like a fly caught in a spider‚Äôs web begging to be killed.

After effects of the meth from yesterday are still rattling around inside of my head like a piece of steel bouncing around the cabin of a plane experiencing major turbulence. That should be obvious. Well, it should be obvious to me that that's what's going on. But it's not. And suddenly, I begin to feel something I haven‚Äôt felt in a few years, since I quit doing meth the last time. It‚Äôs this thing I haven‚Äôt really told you about and makes me question if the events of last night with the man and his eye ever actually happened.

It‚Äôs like this. I‚Äôm smoking my cigarette and my hand turns brown. There are pink splotches of depigmentation on it. My face is brown and has the splotches, too. I am becoming this other person, this other person who used to come out when I used to live in San Francisco mostly but some after that, too. Remember, the psychotic fogs I told you about? I don‚Äôt know if its schizophrenia that makes someone think they‚Äôre someone else sometimes, but it happens after I come down from meth. This guy that I become is Indonesian or something and has a big belly and skinny arms. He likes to wear cheap cologne with flashy jeans and flip flops, so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm wearing flipflops and those jeans right now, but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm wearing my shoes. He doesn‚Äôt have a name, but he has halitosis. And bad acne, so I have acne, now. Pimples stand up off my face like pink nodules made of ground sausage as I become him and he becomes me.

Distractions will pull me out of it, you know, make me snap back to reality. Like, if someone talks to me, it goes away. My skin is normal, again. My breath doesn‚Äôt stink, but if I‚Äôm alone and smoking a cigarette in the corner of a quiet parking lot, say, then it comes on hard. I know all kinds of things about him. For example, his mother raised him in a small village somewhere and spoiled him with sweets and housework. He tried to make it in his country‚Äôs capital city but failed. He is too soft. His mother made him that way. I am the Indonesian guy, sometimes. He is me. We are melted into each other. And he‚Äôs only a few years older than I am but somehow also ancient. I talk to him, but he never says anything back. Just cries or smiles.

And so that‚Äôs all going on with me. You know, one of those episodes when reality breaks and your head is caught in it, and this guy walks over to me. I hear his footsteps, which snaps me out of it, and he asks me for a cigarette, so I pull one out and hand it to him. He needs a light, too.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù I light his cigarette.

He leans in and pulls the smoke into his lungs. He lets it out through his nostrils. ‚ÄúThanks, bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. No problem.‚Äù And just like that, I know that I need a gun and this guy knows where to get one. ‚ÄúYou know where to get a piece?‚Äù

‚ÄúPiece of what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know. A piece, bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù

‚ÄúA gun.‚Äù

His head pulls back in shock. I don‚Äôt think he expected the request. ‚ÄúI know someone.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

We walk to the street and down the hill. He tells me that his name is Peanut Boy and that he was just picking up from Ed. Around the corner, his girlfriend stands up from sitting on the ground and looking into a pocket mirror with tweezers in her other hand. Her hair is beautiful. It must have cost more than 100 dollars to get it done, not that I know anything about women‚Äôs hairdos, but it looks expensive.

‚ÄúThis is Barbie.‚Äù Peanut Boy says and continues walking. She follows. Barbie looks to have run her face through a barbed wire fence, which stands out in contrast to the hairdo. There are multiple layers of scratches on her face done at different times. There are the small black ones crusted over with scabbing and fresher ones on top of that. The topmost layer has three fresh sores she is currently picking at in the mirror as we walk. They are open and revealing the slimy pink under her skin. It looks painful, but we keep walking. She keeps picking.

We‚Äôre heading downtown. I can see the whole skyline in the distance pretty well. It‚Äôs not raining today, but fog rises in angry spires from the city streets and around buildings. It looks like smoke, like emissions of poisonous gasses from geysers on the surfaces of hostile planets. We ride a bus for a while and get off. Peanut Boy seems confused. Barbie hasn‚Äôt said a word. In the distance the space needle reminds me of the tentacled, alien vehicles from War of the Worlds, as I ask him,

‚ÄúAre you sure you know where we‚Äôre going?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He has a smileless countenance.

We wander some more and ride another bus. It is raining again, and the day is dark, like it‚Äôs almost night. Four hours have passed at least, since we left the crack motel. Peanut Boy has started digging in every trashcan we come to. Not at first, but now he pulls out sloppy packages of checkered paper and pours slimy chunks of whatever it has once been onto the pavement and picks through it. Sometimes, just a thin gruel. Other times, it may be easier to identify, but it always stinks. He doesn‚Äôt eat any of it. It seems to be some sort of involuntary tick, a compulsion caused by too many years on the streets and too many drugs.

We ride one more bus and get off to walk another couple miles in the rain, and we get to this hill that looks like it‚Äôs made up of trash and the trees and bushes on it are just growing out of the mess itself. There are a few bridges way above us making it even darker. Rain falls heavier, now, in cold skinny fingers down my collar to my belly and chest.

We trudge up the hill. There are broken shopping carts and tires and empty propane tanks sinking in the mud and uncapped needles all over the place and an orange life preserver and giant carnival prize Snoopy that has been disemboweled of its stuffing and scattered and every kind of trashed item you can imagine. Up a way, we come upon several tents.  It‚Äôs like this is the end of the world. The bridge is the edge of it, and we‚Äôve fallen off into this forsaken encampment, this pile of waste. It stinks, as if the rain itself is just the world urinating cold, concentrated garbage juice on us.

Outside of a boxy, canvas tent, Peanut Boy does a little hoot and it opens. A Moorish looking man with long features and a mole on his lip looks out. There is a kerosene lamp inside. He doesn‚Äôt speak. Peanut Boy does all the talking, saying he needs a gun and what‚Äôs the price. The Moorish man holds up all ten fingers, so Peanut Boy turns to me and says,

‚Äú100 bucks.‚Äù

It seems really cheap to me. But, what do I know?  I've never done this kind of thing before. So, I pull out a hundred bucks and hand it over. The exchange is made. I give another 20 to Peanut Boy and descend the hill. The gun is heavy in my hand and cold against my stomach as I walk away. It takes a while, but eventually, I get to a place where I can hail a taxi and ride back to my room.

23

My dad used to take me to flea markets before the divorce.

Once I moved back in at 15, he didn‚Äôt go to them anymore. He never took me anyway, but when I was little we went to one where they had this table all devoted to smaller home appliances. There were microwaves and toasters and mini ovens and that kind of thing and then there were three waffle irons. Well, when I opened one of the waffle irons, it had pieces of batter stuck in the square grid crevices, like whoever owned it before was giving you a little piece of themselves with their waffle iron. It was gross. I showed my dad, and we laughed so hard that other customers laughed, too.

I have a similar imaginations about the gun I just bought. They‚Äôre not funny though. Seriously, I hate it. I‚Äôve washed my hands several times since I‚Äôve been back in the room, trying to get the invisible grime of whatever abominable immorality or murder it is coated in off my hands. What kind of implications does it carry for me just having it in my possession? What terrible things has it done? Has it killed? It‚Äôs become this massive worry in my mind that my whole life revolves around, and when I think about it, it‚Äôs like the waffle iron at that flea market. The same way there were bits of waffle batter left in the griddle is the same way I imagine pieces of someone else‚Äôs brain and blood or hair are left in the gun. Maybe, a tooth is lodged in the barrel somewhere, but I‚Äôm too scared of the gun to look. I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs loaded or how to load it or how to shoot it. It‚Äôs stupid for me to have it, but it‚Äôs under my bed, now. It‚Äôs part of the ride I‚Äôm riding, the life I‚Äôm living, the death I‚Äôm dying, whatever you want to call it.

I do a shot. Shots of heroin make my problems go away. Shots of heroin also make more problems for me. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm where I‚Äôm at now. Heroin addiction is funny like that. While I‚Äôm rushing, Sal calls.

‚ÄúWhere you at?‚Äù He asks.

‚ÄúOn the northside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn a hotel or what?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Got a room for the week.‚Äù

‚ÄúAight. Aight. Cool, man. My boy said he wants to meet you. Said he wanted to know who‚Äôs selling so much.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool. I was going to call you anyway. I need to re-up.‚Äù It surprises me that as far out as drugs take me, as horrifying as the reality is behind these eyelids that I‚Äôm able to handle my business so well. I make good moves and say the right things.

‚ÄúAlright. I‚Äôll stop by. Give me the address.‚Äù

My oxy tolerance was up to 120 mg, I kicked it for a month and when I returned it cut by half...so I been back at it for about a week now 


last night I took my 60 mg of oxy and also added 25 mg of hydrocodone 10 minutes later to potentiate... 


What resulted -I can swear was one of my best nods arguably ever... I was falling asleep in the kitchen standing up. I have no idea how much time passed, but I can say that each time I opened my eyes from my nod it felt like another hour had passed...it was magical. I was in a dreamlike state. I have never reached this level of opiates before. It almost felt like I was opiate naive or a new user lol ...

My best guess is the hydro added a lot of sedation to the oxy...

Pulled yesterday's boot from a high shelf, time for a rinse. Welp. I settled in to a random Troma movie when suddenly I felt a tickle in the roof of my mouth... Whatever, I'm high and watching Toxie. Quickly, I noticed it was getting worse... My face was red and hot, the roof of my mouth was itchy and swollen feeling, and I noticed my airway was closing up. I was going into anaphylactic shock. At an astounding rate. There was no time to get to hospital. No epipen, this has never happened before. I was wheezing and barely getting any air. Thought I was going to die. Thankfully, just before my airway swelled all the way shut, it relented, and my symptoms subsided. After some brilliant deduction, I had discovered that the anaphylaxis was due to allergens that had infiltrated the rinse sitting out all night (I usually wrapped it up but not that time). Those allergens? Fucking cat dander. From the AIR. This sounds dumb just writing it. But in all my travels, I never knew anyone to have this experience, thought maybe I would share the tale to relate the possibility. I guess I wanted to leave this here.

It is important to me because Nirvana rocked my world and Kurt was a junkie. I thought he had it all together. He said he did.

He was a young guy, only 27. He had a cool wife, a kid, supposedly his stomach was not hurting him, he was famous, everybody in the entire world loved him and would have willingly been his slave for life except for Axel Rose, and he had all the fire dope a man could want. 

Why would he suicide?

Have you ever been sitting in a parking lot, waiting for your connect to show?

He is fifteen minutes away. Thirty minutes later, you leave, drive around, call him, he‚Äôs on the way. Drive back to the meet, he is still not there. 

Another thirty and you hit him. Now you have to go to the burger king, because he just figured out that the parking lot is hot.

Then, another twenty and you finally cop, but it turns out to be short, or is shit dope or something else is wrong. And half the day is gone. You were supposed to be at work 2 hours ago and everything is fucked.

Or, you go down to the hood to cop. But guys are feeling playful and you get the runaround. Oh, you know man. Dude is bagging up. Should be any minute now. 

Later, much later, it is still any minute. But the cops are on the prowl now. They know you don‚Äôt belong and they better not see you.

Then somebody else approaches, and you are wary, but Shorty, who you kind of trust a little, says this guy is cool. You just need to drop him at another block. It will only take a minute.

Now you are on full alert. You watch, you wait. You squirm. Forty five minutes later, he finally comes out. You get your dope and go home. 

A little later, you are starting to realize that something is wrong. You are high, but you feel like you took too much cough syrup. You just want to lie on your bed and cry, even though you are a man. 

Or, you are getting oxys at the friendly neighborhood pain doc. After waiting two hours, he comes in and says that he has decided he has to change you to from 90 oxys to 30 5 mg lortab and no more benzos for you. And now you will need to pay for a drug test once a month. That will be four hundred dollars, please. Cash only.

In the back of my mind, I am eternally optimistic. I will go get my dope, pay the man, go home and get high. What could possibly go wrong? It is a simple proposition.

But now, I have done all this a million billion times, and I can‚Äôt really even get high anymore. Maybe if I found the right dope, it would be like the first time. Maybe the angels would come down and sing to me again, and I would be at peace. But I know tomorrow will be the same. Therefore, I make sure I don't think about tomorrow.

I know there are people all about get high till you die. I can‚Äôt. It is too fucking hard. 

Call me a pussy. I am not doing the dope game. I don‚Äôt think that is any way to live.

Dope is cool for a while, but in the long run it sucks. I am not going to let another eleven years go by and then be too old to have fun and have a heart attack and die anyway. I think Kurt would agree, if he were around.

They had been on methadone for some time, as well as taking flubro and etizolam very consistently. They had run out of flubro and had come into some flualprazolam.

The test includes an ‚Äúopiates‚Äù panel, along with an oxycodone panel and an additional methadone panel (so those two are out of the question).

From what I‚Äôve looked up, the opiates panel would find drugs that metabolize into morphine, so I‚Äôm aware that codeine and heroin would be included.

The opi‚Äôs that im asking about would be: HYDROCODONE, HYDROMORPHONE, and OXYMORPHONE.

The thing that‚Äôs really tripping me up is the oxymorphone. The test covers oxycodone, and apparently oxymorphone is one of its metabolites, so that‚Äôs making me wonder if it‚Äôd be tested for.

I know that synthetic opioids won‚Äôt show up unless they‚Äôre specifically tested for, like tramadol and bupe and shit like that.

Oxy is the only thing that makes me happy. It pushes all the shit aside and makes me the person I want to be. I can see my problems and how I can fix them so easily. Yet it always ends after a few hours.

To anyone who was in my position but decided to make a change, was it worth it? It must be so much work to do but was the end result worth the pain? Did you actually find happiness?

..............................................

&#x200B;

So, i had this talk today trough a forum with an opiate addicted person. This is for people with an addiction on painmeds or h or any sort of opiates that DO NOT HAVE things like subutex,suboxone,√πethadone,bupronerphine,etc... This is for people that HAVE to score daily to not get sick.

&#x200B;

He or she told me he/she shoots H and is from Canada. The person told me that when in the wd is starting to begin and she/he feels sick and sicker by the minutes, the person feels already better when he/she just scored dope. So not even used it but knowing that you have it makes him/her 20% better (i think it's in the head bc you know 100% you going to get better asap).

&#x200B;

Are others that have this to?

&#x200B;

I myself get 100UG fent patches and have still enough stock from my uncle that died a while back (i made a post about it). So i myself have had cold sweats, running nose and eyes and my legs that started to burn a little. But i never had full blown wd like puking etc bc i always have patches and know i can go home when i forget to dose/or get stuck in traffick and wd starts bc i know the patches are there.

&#x200B;

So are there others that feel the same like that person i talked to on a forum?

Hope the grammar is ok.

Does anyone know if oxycodone could possibly have any kind of ceiling effect like codeine possibly in some way? Because after like 10 or so years of taking oxy orally this whole time, and having this same habit right now for at least the last 5 years without skipping a day, I have reached a dose of what I took tonight which was 45 30s in one dose or 1,350mg of oxycodone IR and barely had any euphoria and pretty much only noticed a little lift from my withdrawal symptoms and pain going away. I took the 45 of them in one dose and then when I noticed nothing really happening I took another couple 15s like 30 mins later and then a few more 30s an hour or so after that. I only dose once a day, I take my daily dose at night before I eat dinner and that will hold my w/d away for 24 hours, I will wake up in the morning sober, not high but not in withdrawal and then around 5-6 pm start experiencing some yawning etc and ill dose around 7 and the cycle repeats. I am thinking of starting to taper myself down so I can quit at a reasonable dose since the last time I cold turkey'd I was only take 120mg once a day and I stayed at that dose for years before I had to up it but over the last 2-3 years it has just grown and grown little by little from 9 a day, 15, 20, 25 then over the last year its gone from 25 a day to the 45 im at right now and it went from like 30 to 45 in the last like 3 months, because I remember over the summer last year I wasn't taking more than 30 of them in one dose once per day. Everybody who's gona come in and tell me i'm an idiot and I should switch to dope etc etc can fuck off because I am still a functional adult who can hold/excel my job and earn money and do anything else I need to in life, if I switched to heroin im sure it would all be over within 6 months or so because I have seen it first hand happen, there is no quality control with heroin and with oxy I at least know what I'm getting every time as long as they are real pills which they pretty much always are except for the few times I've almost gotten duped. I have researched Ibogaine and been recommended a facility by a close friend who is a doctor that would be up to my standards but its just too scary to fly to somewhere, trip my balls off while i'm in withdrawal and have no idea what would happen, and I've been to regular 30 day rehabs a few times but thats when I was still only on a relatively low dose, or what I considered low back then LOL. I would literally kill somebody today if I could some how magically be transported back to the days when I was only taking 4-5 30s a day and be able to quit like that. Its been a wild ride and I really do want to stop, I hate the lifestyle I live and would love to be able to see 30 years old. Idk im just ranting, I dont usually post like this and to anybody who's gona call me a liar they can fuck off too cause I really don't care, I've been on this sub for a long time, came here when opiophile when down the shitter in like 2013-14 around there.

For the sake of my family id never kill myself even though I've thought about it but I've seen what its done to my friends who had stronger families than I do and there family will just never be the same after they died and I couldn't do that to my mom and dad. sorry for the rant, I wrote this all last night while I was high then never posted it and here reading It stone sober in the morning im gona be depressed all day at work since I mostly try and block out thinking about this shit.",1550683745.0

So this morning, my favorite tech site is talking about gene editing and the state of the art in fixing your crappy genes. There is a technique called CRISPR that scientists now have available. If I am getting this right, they can kind of cut and paste genes now. They use enzymes to take out bad dna and replace it with better, improved versions.

Then, to get the new dna into the body, they take a common virus, put the new dna inside, and inject it into a mouse to infect the little guy with better genetic material.

The idea is that the new dna will replace whatever bad gene is causing the issues.

Seems a good fit for addiction. Right? Just find whatever gene causes you to do dope, cut it out and replace it with normal person dna.

Well, not quite that simple. Yet. First, it is not for sure that addiction is caused by genes. Current thinking in the US is that it is a 50 - 50 deal between the environment and genetics. Read more in the link below.

BUT - that is info gathered in the US.

In Japan, if I understand correctly, only a tiny portion of the population are drug addicts or even drunks.

The Japanese are very intolerant of illegal drugs and they still have a society where people are pretty much homogenous, meaning they are not that into cultural diversity. They sort of look alike, make decisions together, and are super sensitive to pissing each other off. Hence the bows, respect, etc.

From what I gather, they arrest something like 13,000 people every year on drug charges.

Unless, of course, you are Paul Mccartney or another foreign devil musician, in which case they are going to bust the shit out of you and make your life miserable for coming over there to entertain them. Stash that dope, Paul!

Just kidding. I like and admire the Japanese.

In the US, I am pretty sure arrest figures are in the millions.

But wait, if it is true that most opiate addicts are exposed to addiction by pharmaceutical products, should we not have similar rates of addiction? The Japanese have doctors too, after all.

BUT - nothing is ever that simple. In research involving where addiction comes from, there is a shitload of conflicting and complicated information. Which is why we have scientists to stay awake at night figuring this stuff out.

At this point, no, they cannot simply get rid of addiction genes. And even if they could, some people would still be addicts.

10 years from now? I would say there is a good possibility science will be able to help us out.

Here are the links for the articles I refer to, if anyone is interested.

Idk what to do at this point. Just wasted 4 days of my time, and now idk if I should stay for the repeat of what we just did. I thank you all for the advice, I‚Äôm just sorry I couldn‚Äôt but it too much use.__


Now, I don‚Äôt like the way I worded the title, he‚Äôs not making me do anything. I‚Äôm more than happy to help because he‚Äôs do the same for me, but the way he was asking there‚Äôs no way I can actually say no. 

So my friend (we‚Äôll call him Z). Him and I were friends since grade school, never really had other friends but each other. Whatever pack eachother scored that day, (anything from weed to fent riddled H) we would split it because that‚Äôs just how we roll, it‚Äôs like matching on a bag. You know he‚Äôll get you next time, visa versa it was a good system. But recently I know Z has been skimping out on seshes and bags, and I found out why. He has a major fucking opiate problem. Man I didn‚Äôt even know, but we made a pact to never IV anything. I found out last week because he came to me to take him to the ER over an abscess. And his arm just looks horrible, im not sure he knows the ins and outs of this. I wish someone taught him at least because a few of his veins already went. I‚Äôm not mad at him of course, I‚Äôm just disappointed he kept it from me.

We‚Äôre diehard homies, I hope he wasn‚Äôt embarrassed or scared to come to me because of that pact. But anyway, his folks are coming into town 2 weeks from now and my buddy looks absolutely like shit. In one month alone he‚Äôs gone down hill pretty fast, his cheek bones are starting to become his most prominent facial feature. Didn‚Äôt think it was that fast. But anyway, he wants to get clean before they come, because he wants to hide the habit. 

So Z asked me to basically be his ‚ÄúTrip sitter‚Äù for his withdrawal... I‚Äôm worrying how I‚Äôm gonna do this day after day for the next week or 2 because this is going on the 3rd day this dude has shit himself a few times, had the building manager come for noise complaints because he moans really loudly, and I just can‚Äôt keep going with this. Babying him to drink, or eat. Telling him he doesn‚Äôt need that gunk he slams. I have work, I have a life, my girl, everything I‚Äôm putting on hold for this dude and I‚Äôm afraid if I leave he‚Äôll just go buy a bag and it starts all over. Seeing the way he needs it so much makes me think he‚Äôs been using for more than he says, but who cares at this point.

I‚Äôve made this post to basically ask for help at this point because I haven‚Äôt slept a wink since the first night, and I‚Äôm just looking on ways to make the WD easier on Z. Either of us has WDed like this before and I don‚Äôt know what to avoid or what to do honestly. Do I just basically watch my friend moan and wriggle on his bed or should I make him go for a walk?

I‚Äôm an extremely nice human being, i value and respect others and their time and also make sure if there‚Äôs any mistake made that it‚Äôs timely fixed and made correctly (say if a bag is a .05g off, I‚Äôll meet back up and bring the .05 as well as extra for the mistake, or add extra the next meet up and take a few bucks off).  I‚Äôm not a prick or a jerk and I‚Äôm always amazed at how heroin destroys, corrupts and bends people‚Äôs minds.  Yet, I‚Äôve almost met the best friends that I‚Äôve ever had and also meet the best woman, whose so compassionate and loving, with whom I‚Äôm dating through my ‚Äújob.‚Äù

Rewind to a couple of days ago, I‚Äôm winding my day down because i believe in having a normal outside life and i make enough during my ‚Äúworking hours‚Äù to pay rent at 2 apartments and a boat slip on the southern west coast. I generally make myself available from 7am to roughly 6:30pm but I‚Äôll occasionally meet up with my trusted regulars after dark. I will not meet new people after dark at all. 

I have quite a few regular customers whom I‚Äôve been dealing with for  quite sometime and I‚Äôve added newer ones in the last month to 2 months. This is a story about one of them.

So on my TextNow app about a month and a week or 2 weeks ago, i had a random number message me saying they needed something. So i asked my basic questions and gave them a time and locations to meet and explained that i like talk a little bit before i decided to begin our business arrangements. This woman tells me her husband and child is with her, so since i knew this info before time, i didn‚Äôt send them off. While waiting on the 2nd story parking structure of a grocery store downtown, the best up, old single cab Mazda truck pulls around and parks. A semi-stereotypical white trash couple gets out with their 3-5 year old kid sits in the truck with its windows rolls up. Long story short, i explain my side and how i do business, and we start doing business consistently up until a couple days ago.

As I‚Äôm starting to end my day, the couple messages me and ask for a gram. I have them meet me at a new place on the corner of some place not far from our stash apartment, the usual happens. They text me they‚Äôre there and i show up roughly 2 mins later because I‚Äôm almost always watching everyone pull up if it‚Äôs possible because i like to see what‚Äôs going on. The difference with this meeting is usually they‚Äôre parking in a parking lot with the nose of the truck towards a brick wall, while on the street, they‚Äôre parked about 10 feet behind another car.

Per the usual, the husband gets out and goes to the front of the truck, and i walk to the front to talk and sell to him. So, we‚Äôre shooting the shit while I‚Äôm watching the street for cops or anything i need to worry about and the coast is clear. So, i pull the gram out of my stash spot on my clothes and just kinda show it to him while holding it lose in my hand. He reaches into his pocket and hands me a small amount of money folded up with a $5 on the outside. I quickly realized, this seems small, and open it to start counting it(ended up getting $8 instead of $80). While I‚Äôm opening the money to count it, the engine of the small, best up truck roars and shoots forward towards me,clipping my right arm as well as slightly connecting with my lower rib cage. While gunning it, she doesn‚Äôt realize the distance of the car in front of her and smashes into it, with the door of the truck open and her child being thrown forward and back from the power of the engine and the sudden stop of the car in front of her.

So, i grab the door of the truck trying to hop in to take care of what i need to but again she guns it and i can‚Äôt get in fast enough before she‚Äôs down the road. Her husband is on the street so he‚Äôs my next target to connect for trying to con me out of a gram. So he starts running, and i start chasing. The issue is the truck is roughly between us. The wife is driving and trying to side swipe me to keep me away from her husband but also not stopping to let me open the door this continues for roughly a block in front of a mental health alliance/homeless outreach center. So there‚Äôs a large crowd, we run the entire city block before the wife cuts it too hard one last time, and smashed the end of a white suv when i realize, them smashing into 2 cars is going to get the cops coming and people were watching and started getting out their phones. 

At this point, i say fuck it and take off back to the safety of my stash apartment, with a small cut on my wrist and some slight pain on my ribs. This couple was literally trying to smash me with a car over a gram.  I refuse to hold weapons while selling because of the extra charges that brings, but I‚Äôll throw down if i need to. Now, trying to possibly kill me with their car over a gram. That‚Äôs something out. So, long story short, if your planning on trying to get one over on your dealer, make sure the amount is right and that you get the job done instead of fucking up everything. 

It‚Äôs jungle out there, make sure you respect the players and the game, otherwise you lose it. They‚Äôre already hurting again today bc they used it up. I‚Äôve reached out to other dealers i know, and they‚Äôre been black-listed so, i have the luxury of knowing that for awhile they‚Äôll be hurting. They didn‚Äôt actually get the gram in hand and I‚Äôm 95% sure it was ran over by a car, plus it‚Äôs really just a gram so overall lost is not much with the amount we purchase at a time.

I smoke Winston cigarettes.

Winstons remind me of Ghostbusters. The cartoon. Not the movies. I‚Äôm not exactly sure why that is. I think there was a character named Winston or something. Maybe, it was the black guy. I think that was his name, right? Or was it Ray? I remember a Ray for sure. I don‚Äôt know, though. I just know that's why I like them, because they remind me of Ghostbusters cartoons and being a kid on Saturday mornings.

Now, Beth is sitting on the floor asking me for one. I buy soft packs. They‚Äôre retro, kind of, at least to me, and so I pick one out of the soft pack in my pocket, and they‚Äôre all smushed but not broken, and she reaches up and grabs the lighter from off the scratched coffee table in front of the couch. It‚Äôs the one I helped her pull out of a dumpster after the colleges went to summer break last year. She turns her head to keep from setting her hair on fire as she lights the smoke and asks me,

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know. Same old. Same old.‚Äù The banter of some old macho cowboy is blaring in the background. Black and white images flicker on the screen.

‚ÄúThis is not the same old, same old, Randy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure? Seems like it to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I know better than that. I‚Äôm not tripping on you or nothing. You just don‚Äôt ever come over here on a Thursday morning. You have a job, remember? Or am I wrong about that?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say anything. Just smile.

‚ÄúGot fired?‚Äù She asks.

‚ÄúNo. Not exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt say that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat would you say?‚Äù She squints at me.

‚ÄúIt was time to retire from my career as a valet. What? You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a time to move on from something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But, usually, when someone moves on from something, they have something to move onto. Ya know?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what exactly do you think I‚Äôm here for?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. So. You moved onto me, have you?‚Äù Her words are sweet and full of a certain sadness.

‚ÄúYeah. I don‚Äôt see why not, baby.‚Äù I smile big.

‚ÄúBaby? I‚Äôm not your baby. Besides. George wouldn‚Äôt have it.‚Äù George is her sugar daddy. He immigrated over here as a kid but now pays her rent and bills in exchange for whenever he wants her companionship. It‚Äôs hard to think that they have sex, but I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not my business. Either way, he‚Äôs not possessive of her. A true sugar daddy.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs George gotta know about it?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm. He pays the rent, dude. He‚Äôs gonna know if you live here. He comes by with groceries twice a week and has the right to come in whenever he wants.‚Äù Old George won‚Äôt have it. Beth‚Äôs right. ‚ÄúYou can stay tonight. That‚Äôs not an issue. It‚Äôs anything after that I‚Äôm worried about.‚Äù

I nod and look up at one of her baby doll heads. Beth has a thing about decapitating baby dolls and painting them. It‚Äôs her artistic expression. At least, that‚Äôs what she says. Her baby cries from the back room, and Beth runs to go get her. I haven‚Äôt seen the child since Beth first had her and brought her to all the meetings for everyone to meet, like it was this awkward pink and grey ball of mashed up hamburger meat in a napkin that we were all supposed to pass around and be excited about. You know?

Maybe that makes me sound like a bad guy, and in all honesty, I wouldn‚Äôt even try to pretend that I‚Äôm not, but this isn‚Äôt that. Not exactly. What I‚Äôm talking about is more like an inability to recognize the feelings other people seem to be having in myself, like I know I should feel a certain way about something but don‚Äôt. Like when I was 10 years old and went to a baseball game with my step dad, and the home team hit one out of the park with two runners on base. The crowd went nuts. They stood and clapped and cheered and howled. I just couldn‚Äôt believe it. I couldn‚Äôt believe that a whole stadium of grown people and kids and crusty geezers and all of them were just so over the moon with the fact that this guy swung a stick which knocked a ball over the fence.

So, Beth comes back in with her daughter who, apparently, has turned into an extremely selfish and irrationally angry monkey over the last ten months. The child pulls Beth‚Äôs hair and screams. She knocks things over and laughs. It seems like children always want to do the worst possible thing they can, like play with the chemicals under the sink or stick something in an electrical outlet or crush themselves by climbing on cabinets and pulling them down on top of themselves, but I‚Äôm not much different.

asif34,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/asif34/the_cycle/,5,https://redd.it/asif34,Waiting_on_a_Corner,The Cycle,"Kneeling with your head in the toilet, unsure if you are going to puke or shit yourself is always an unpleasant place to be. But regardless I sat there in my bathroom until the pain hit me‚Ä¶


As an invisible knife twisted though my right abdomen, pain flooded my brain. I fell to the floor gasping for breath, and began dragging myself to the door out. I opened the door collapsing into the hallway, just two feet from T's door. I pounded on it crying in pain, he opened it as his face went ghostly white. 


T wasn't nearly prepared to be the roommate of a drug addict who's habit had spun out of control. But he held his composure as I writhed in agony.


‚ÄúYou have to take me to the hospital. Now.‚Äù I yelled, as he helped me up.


‚ÄúOk, ok, let's get you in the car.‚Äù


After grabbing my wallet and phone I sat in the car, crying in the fetal position. T explained why it was 2am and he had to go to his girlfriend, and sped to the hospital. Dropping me off I collapsed out of the car but managed to make it to the ER desk and was told to go to triage. 


When the doctor came in he said I probably ¬†had kidney infection. He wrote me a script for some antibiotics, something called Tramadol, and shooed me out. Back in the waiting room no longer in agony I called for a ride. It was 3:00 the deadest time of night and I had no shoes, grey joggers, and a sleeveless shirt on, that I done myself. I tried mom and dad first, nothing, then T, but again no answer. After a half hour I gave up and called an Uber. I forgot my keys so I called T until he woke up, and staggered downstairs to let me in. 


Tramadol was a new opiate to me. I had stolen or been prescribed ¬†oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine but this was new. The next day I called in and picked up the script. It had the usual opiate warnings ‚ÄúDo not take with alcohol or benzodiazepines‚Äù. It also said ‚Äútake every 8 hours‚Äù, so naturally I took two 50mg pills, with .25mg of Xanax, then went outside to smoke a bowl. Soon the opiates washed over my brain, mmmm sweet metabolites‚Ä¶ I headed inside to play Call of Duty, I hardly felt my footsteps, I was on a cloud. Playing online my KTD was barely 0.15 but I didn't care, I was high as a kite, floating on the couch. I was filled with the careless wonder of euphoria, like my best childhood moments were all happening at once. My body was far away, like another planet, I was far away deep in the pleasure of my mind. I closed my eyes and there in the darkness was a warmth, like a campfire on a cool summer night. I got as close as I could to bask in the warmth and love. 


After that taste the old well known opiate cravings controlled my every move. Every doctor's appointment ended with my well performed routine, and out came a script for Tramadol. Ahh the ‚Äúnon addictive‚Äù opiate of the time became my go to drug. My buddy Lin from work had heard the stories I spread at work about being sick and on meds. Lin was a merciful friend and after I told him my scripts had ‚Äúrun out‚Äù, he responded with words every junkie gets excited about.


‚ÄúI have a bunch of old meds if you're still in pain‚Äù


My heart skipped a beat and I had to suppress my excitement.


‚ÄúThanks dude, I don't wanna take your meds but it hurts so bad‚Äù I responded as calmly as I could manage.


Sure enough the next day Lin showed up with two orange bottles with the labels ripped off. One with almost 60 50mg Tramadol and another with 30 mixed Vicodin and Percocet. I could hardly believe the mix, it was at least enough for a week. And so my binge began


300mg or 400mg was a great high but 600 was nearing godly. Especially the combinations with a couple oxy and some Xanax. Their sweet golden Icor flowed through and over ¬†me, wave after wave of peace. Soothing everything from work problems to life problems, my life was good . 


Then it all ended, the pills ran out doctors told me my sickness had passed. As the withdrawals sunk their teeth in, I found myself in the bathroom again. On all fours, face in the toilet, wearing only boxers and a towel, unsure if I was about to vomit or shit myself‚Ä¶

To save time I‚Äôll say that I had a moment of anger, and this morning I reared back and with all my momentum had full intention to put my fist through a door, the wall be hind it, and put my hand somewhere beyond the 3rd dimension.  I‚Äôll say that the force was there but ultimately my mind was wrong, imagining a cheap hollow core door and instead discovering a wooden door that was made from some kind of ancient, blessed, elven wood. I knew pretty instantly I made the wrong decision. 

I sat at the ER. From 11 AM till 6 PM. Over the course of this time I had an x-ray I would buy a CT scan, and followed by another x-ray. In between the CT scan and the last x-ray, it was discovered that I had two fractures one in my metacarpals, and then one in a wrist bone, the wrist fracture was also dislocated. They attempted to force the loose bone back in place as they put a kind of cast on. 

Luckily the IVs cars were not noticed, and I was able to avoid that conversation. After being prescribed 12 5 mg hydrocodone‚Äôs and laughing his sterically on the inside, I wondered if I was beginning to regret telling them about my opiate tolerance.

I believe the medication is only supposed to last me a few days before I see a bone specialist, I am told he will then refer me to a hand specialist, that will intern perform a surgery or pens or put in my hand to keep the loose bone in place while it heals. 

I‚Äôm wondering what I should do from here in order to make sure I have proper pain management, I will say that I have a pretty high tolerance of pain and even as I type this although the hydrocodone is not touching it, I can bear it pretty well. 

That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt mind a little extra recreationally prescribed, and legal entertainment. ",1550626875.0

I ended up staying in a hotel 20mins away from the facility and through the grace of God they picked me back up and readmitted me into the residential program. 

As soon as I got back into the community people were constantly approaching me saying either one of two things. One being ""I know you have shit (dope) on you, and I want some"" ( essentially begging me for drugs) or just telling me how pissed the fuck off that I was back because I just got high in rehab with shit that, in there eyes, I 'Snuck' in. Fyi I didnt purposely sneek anything in. 

That drove me nuts, on top of my room being tossed and me having to refold and reorganize my room daily, and the constant strip searches, I was getting annoyed. My peers looked at me has a fake or still having drugs on me, and staff was constantly suspicious,  with good reason due to the past situation. 

I ended up leaving today. I had to walk off this fucking mountain the facility sat on top off, in the cold  NH weather where it had been snowing every other day(luckily this off the off day it didnt snow). Also luckily another client was leaving at the same time. His girlfriend wired him a few hundred dollars and we took the $150 cab ride to my car about 60miles away in Maine. 

Long story short, I am broke, and have no place to rest my head due to my parents thinking I left with the intention to get high. I may just go out to California to go to another treatment. If anyone has any connections in the Florida or California rehab scene, drop me a message. I have made one contact but it looks like due to my insurance cali might not be an option, even though I do have fire insurance.  

This was just an update because many requested that I kept them informed. I hope everyone is staying safe and having happy nods. Drop me a prayer if you're into that.

And that makes Thursday through Monday fine (Th and Sat good, Fri and Sun ok).  Mon-Wed are ok except that I find it difficult to get to sleep.  Kind of restless and tossing and turning in bed, I guess because my body wants tramadol or some other opiate.  So I usually take a little bit of whatever benzodiazapine is handy on one of those days, maybe some CBD oil on one of the other of those days.  If I don't take anything, then it's a good two hours at least to get to sleep.  This sleeping problem on Mon-Wed is the only downside to my tramadol taking.  Any advice?",1550608558.0

I've been in pm for four years to treat chronic systemic pain from fibro and arthritis. Lucky me. 18 months ago like a stupid ass I ran out early because of course the then current dose of 15mg oxy 2x daily and the ER opioid wasn't controlling my pain. I went into horrible wd and was labeled as an addict for ""abusing my medication."" I eventually got into a Sub clinic and while it did stop the WD bupe is a horrible analgesic.

I wrote this post because after being on Sub for 18 months my pain is increasing. I also have anxiety and depression that worsened after pain began suddenly and my best friend was killed. In addition to ineffective off label uses of Rx drugs I have taken a somewhat holistic approach to my issues. I take kava, L-theanine (for anxiety) and homoeopathy with magnesium lotion for pain issues. These help a ton.... they're very effective actually and I am so happy to have found them.

My concern is both the rapid degeneration of health issues and length of time being on 20mg of Sub. The pain clinic will only Rx topical lidocaine. But I go because I want it one record. Neither any specialist nor my PCP will help. I got diazapam for a minor procedure and it DID help my pain and I came to find benzos can and do help symptoms of fibro. But of course that was a limited script. I can't get benzos from anybody so I wonder how the fuck anyone else does.

What should I do? I split my Sub dose to keep drug levels at peak as much as possible (I'm aware of long half life but some people are more sensitive to even a minor reduction in drug level after 12 hours) to no avail. There is no analgesic effect that I benefit from. I'm also concerned about my future. Even without having a maintenance drug on your health record nobody will Rx controlled meds. They claim it's about protecting protecting you but I really think it's more about protecting themselves. Liability comes before my daily functioning or lack thereof. 

I hate being punished for this shit. I didn't choose this. I'm going to be 39 in a few weeks and work for myself. I was supposed to start school this winter but iced that plan as I can't focus with the pain. What should I do? Isn't it bs how real legit need is punished instead of relieved?

If you could see the mother, that gave life to such a perfect child who raised and nurtured them to the best she could.

It's so cool to be human?,"Sometimes I wake up early, and my damn brain will start working. And it just won‚Äôt shut up and let me drink my (herbal) tea in peace.

Humans love to put things in categories and today, it appears, is my day to think about us addicts.

Oh my god, realcat67, it is just too early for your drama! Please! Go back to bed.

Sorry, but I am up. Can‚Äôt help it.

It seems to me that we are a lost tribe, sort of like one of the ten tribes of Israel that just disappeared into the dustbin of history. Except we won‚Äôt go away and it pisses everybody off.

We cannot, at least right now, peacefully co-exist with the rest of our brothers and sisters. We are predators of a sort, determined to party down at any cost. Very inconvenient for the rest of the humans. We are not exactly criminals but we cannot be allowed to roam free either, because we do too much damage.

So they look for a kinder, gentler way to cage us. We have drug courts, which to me are kind of nasty.  Go to jail or go to meetings? A lot of meetings.

Not really an easy choice, but thank fuck I am done with all that. Not sure it is a good deal for the people that get jammed up. Prove you are worthy or we will smash you. But wait, what about that porno in your closet, your honor?

Shut up, kid! Look at what you did! 90 days or you pay in spades.

They now allow us, in their infinite generosity, medication assisted therapy.

This is, let us be honest, a kind of deal with the devil. You are not exactly allowed to get high, but you do get to maintain. At least your brain is not shrieking for dope 24/7 and you can have a life, which is a good thing.

Peace of a sort. But still, you got that monkey.

We have the hard core party guys, who are not even thinking about stopping, and revel in their appetite for destruction. I think you guys will admit that the game is, get the dope, do the dope, get happy. Don‚Äôt want to hear any words of wisdom, thank you very much. I will get around to quitting eventually. When I am ready. Maybe. In the meantime, check out these ocs!

We also have the true pain patients. They don't have much choice. They are forced into a state of opiate dependence. Welcome to the club, guys!

Then there are the no assistance of any kind type. Those sometimes annoying or inspiring people who insist on toughing it out and getting clean. And yet, somehow, they remain members of the addict group. Why? You are done, why are you hanging around?

Give me just one reason, why you waste your precious energy?

Praise the lord for the music, which soothes our souls.

Most scary are the death walkers. Those people who think they are beyond redemption. Their habits are so severe, apparently, that they have no real hope of quitting.

Sometimes their circumstances, and by that I am trying to say in a pc way, their brains, are so fucked up beyond all recognition that they seem to be just waiting for the end. I love these guys so much and they freak me out, because I don‚Äôt want anyone to hurt like that.

The funny thing is, as much as we isolate ourselves, we still want that human connection. This is not really debatable, because it is proven by the fact that you are here right now, reaching out and communicating.

Even if you are lurking, you still want to feel some kind of bond with your group. It is human nature. We cannot do solitary. Not long term.

People are so weird.

As per my usual disclaimer, if I have offended you in some way that is, at the moment, incomprehensible to me, I apologize. Not looking to upset people.",1550576491.0

In 1995, France made it so any doctor could prescribe buprenorphine without any special licensing or training. ""Buprenorphine, a first-line treatment for opioid addiction, is a medication that reduces cravings for opioids without becoming addictive itself.""

With the change in policy, the majority of buprenorphine prescribers in France became primary-care doctors, rather than addiction specialists or psychiatrists. Suddenly, about 10 times as many addicted patients began receiving medication-assisted treatment, and half the country‚Äôs heroin users were being treated. Within four years, overdose deaths had declined by 79%

Just hit 3 Years Clean! I'm really happy and proud of myself, though I really didn't see myself where I am now. Thought I'd be much further in life.
Instead, I'm on Welfare, I can't work because I have a rare Circadian Rhythm Disorder that are usually a problem for the Blind...Non-24 Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder. And I feel so bad to need and be eligible for Disability when in reality, given time and therapy, I could probably go back to work...
Giving up my IV Heroin brought up some problems that were burried Deep!

I'm now stuck with C-PTSD, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Low Testosterone and Pain from my Back and a Rare Non-Contagious Skin Disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. It's Horrible, Painful, Disgusting, Progressive and INCURABLE!

I get Cysts as big as Ping-Pong/Golf Balls between my legs, on my ass, under my arms, and just the friction from walking hurts like a MotherF*cker, the only relief I get is that when it gets unbearable, it's usually ""ripe and I can Pop it. It's EXTREMELY painful when I do that. But the relief from the pressure is so great that sometimes it feels good...
I told you it was Gross...well I said disgusting, but it's the same really LOL

Anyways, hopefully I get accepted by Disability...because if I don't, either I live a miserable life of not sleeping for a month while working minimum wage and getting fired for falling asleep/missing too much work, rinse and repeat until I die.
Or I stay on Welfare for the rest of my life and end up killing myself because living check by check and not having enough money for food the last week...until I die doesn't sound like much fun...
And then there's Disability, which would give me a bit more Money so I wouldn't always be stressed out for Money and I could actually maybe have a life. I could even buy a bus pass, which I can't right now on Welfare (huge 700$/Month...I pay 300$ for Rent, >200$ for food, 50$ Internet+Electricity, and the rest goes towards my Meds...

Anyways, thanks for reading me, hope you are holding on to sobriety or enjoying your drugs :)

He was found naked, wrapped in a blanket in the hallway of a Best Western he checked into. He was clutching an emergency exit sign he had ripped off the wall.  They found his room in shambles,  the police said it looked like he was searching for his phone they found behind a sofa. He knew he was dying.  He went out of his room for help.  They found heroin and meth in his system. 

His autopsy report read 26 year old male. History of heroin use as evidenced by multiple needle sticks. Pulmonary edema. Mild cerebral edema. Numerous contusions. Apparent excoriated bug bites.  Splenomegaly. Mild chronic active hepatitis.  

He was all alone.  This is the man who made me breakfast in bed.  Who would carry me out of bed and run my bath and helped me get dressed when I was too sick and depressed to move.  Who carried my 3 lb chihuahua everywhere he went. 

26 year old male received nude. 226 pounds, 78 inches in height with no evidence of decomposition.  The body is cold with waning rigor and posterior lividity.

We come to a square apartment building that‚Äôs only a few stories high. Park in the parking lot and sit in the car with the dome light on. She pulls a pair of scissors out of her purse. Does her best to stand up in the driver‚Äôs seat. But she‚Äôs not actually standing because the car is too small. Just has her legs straight and feet pushing into the floorboard, so she can get her face right in the rearview mirror to see what she‚Äôs doing. And she starts cutting her hair. 

At first, it‚Äôs looking good, like she knows what‚Äôs she‚Äôs doing. Going for a punkish, heroin chic look and it‚Äôs kind of nice, but I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs tweaking even though she won‚Äôt admit it, and so she doesn‚Äôt stop at good enough. Now, it‚Äôs this choppy mess of divots revealing her egg white scalp between the ugly, poofy tufts of her hair, like an animal come from the shearer. Her head looks smaller, so her eyes look bigger, and in them, a certain amount of mental illness and pale death glimmers.

Anyway, the cotton fever does seem to be getting better. My back doesn‚Äôt hurt as much. No trembling. No retching for the last half hour or so. It‚Äôs hard for me to tell. I could probably just have her give me the keys back, but she‚Äôs been so nice about it. Took care of me. Even helped me change my pants after I messed myself. And went to the store for Gatorade and water to help me hydrate. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only a few minutes from Jesse‚Äôs house. I‚Äôll be a half hour. Tops. I promise, and Jesse‚Äôs cool. Just come up with me. You can sit there with him till I get back. Okay. Sound good?‚Äù

It doesn‚Äôt sound good. I just feel so weak. And she seems so insistent, and for some reason, I say,

‚ÄúOkay, whatever,‚Äù against all my better judgement. 

‚ÄúCool. Follow me.‚Äù

I stagger across the black parking lot and step through a cold puddle which soaks my shoe through to the sock. Moving my body brings on the nausea, again. I double over. I retch. A few drops of bitter stomach bile comes out of my mouth into some grass and a string of mucous hangs from one nostril. She‚Äôs just standing there. Her hand in her pocket. The other on the phone and one leg is moving. Finally, I stand back up and follow her up a concrete stairway. 

She walks right into the apartment. No knock. There‚Äôs a filthy trashcan by the door overflowing with trash and another bag in a puddle of whatever is leaking out of it onto the floor. Through a small kitchenette we enter the living room. A fat and shirtless man sitting on the couch playing a video game. There is no hair on his chest. It‚Äôs very weird. I think for a moment maybe it‚Äôs his shape that makes him look so odd, before I realize that it‚Äôs the lack of shape that‚Äôs so strange. 

‚ÄúHey. Jesse. This is Randy.‚Äù

He doesn‚Äôt look up. But he does seem to suffer from a gnarly, neck condition where the overhanging fat on his chin has created a hard to clean crevice where a blackish ring of grease and dirt has formed. Flecks of skin are missing. The lower red and raw layers are showing. 

‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt really talk when he‚Äôs playing his games. But, like I said, Randy. I‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Okay. Hurry.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit here.‚Äù

She pulls a wooden chair up to the side of the coffee table in the middle of the room. I sit. The door closes as she leaves. It‚Äôs hard to get comfortable, but the exhaustion from having to deal with my cotton fever all day. My eyes close a minute. I wake up. Everything looks the same, but it seems like some amount of time has passed. I feel pretty good. The rest helped.

So, I turn to the guy to introduce myself and ask him what he does for a living and would he mind if I did a shot right here in the living room. So, I‚Äôm looking. Waiting for a response. And realize that he is sweating out this cloudy liquid. It hangs in droplets form his chin and nose, like the runoff from a bowl of ramen noodles or some other very salty liquid. The whole place smells like the condiments that come on happy meal hamburgers, and there is not only a greasy black ring around his neck but also around his body staining the fabric of the couch. 

I‚Äôm still looking. Still waiting for him to talk. There‚Äôs no response. No information about where he works. Or even if he works. What his feelings are about me doing drugs in his living room. Nothing. So, I get some water out of the kitchen and use this clear plastic top off a bottle. 

What should take a few seconds takes 30 minutes. It‚Äôs messy. I‚Äôm bleeding. I can smell the iron in my blood, black and coagulating on my arm. Finally, I get it. It‚Äôs in. And, there‚Äôs this heavy feeling, something I‚Äôve felt before. It‚Äôs an overdose. My body stiffens and flops in that weird way that means I need some Narcan or I won‚Äôt be waking up.

I notice when I'm on using opiates for a prolonged amount of time my acne pretty much goes away.  I don't even have to wash my face which if I tried to pull that normally it would be bad news for my complexion.

I'm guessing it is because opiates suppress my testosterone but who knows.  When I go off opiates and start lifting weights my gains are incredible, friends accused me of using steroids.  That's probably the testosterone rebound.

It's breaking the bank and I want to be living a more healthy lifestyle. Now i've kicked before but this time is different, I'm in deeper and I have a full time job. Every other kick in the past i've done I either had no responsibilities at the time, or was in school which still sucked but was doable with kratom and such. I've tried recently to kick over the weekend (start withdrawing end of day friday) and hoping by the time I had to go to work monday I could be stable on kratom but I was wrong. The discomfort and mindset that I'm still in and the need to dose kratom every 3-4 hours to not be completely fucked is torture (my job involves sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time so the restlessness is not okay).

Suboxone seems to be my best bet as of now. I have mad anxiety issues so the uncertainty of the whole process of getting the script is bugging me out. I was hoping people who have gone through this can answer some questions/describe their experience. I know about the whole induction procedure, it's just getting the ball rolling that I'm uneasy about.

I live in a major city on the east coast so there is no shortage of doctors that can prescribe suboxone according to the official suboxone website doctor locator. I found a few primary care physicians nearby. I do need a new PCP anyway since I haven't had a check up in awhile and last time I went to a doctor it was with my grad school insurance. What's the best way to go about this? Should I make an appointment for a check up and then bring it up at the appointment? Or should I call and inquire specifically about suboxone/opioid addiction treatment right off the bat?

I've also read that insurance seems to be a weird thing with suboxone doctors, like apparently most don't accept insurance for these types of visits. I have UHC and the doctors I'm looking at are in network so I'm hoping that it would be covered, or at the very least the prescription would be covered. Or say I do a check up which is definitely covered, describe my situation there, then perhaps the separate induction appointment may or may not be covered? What's everyone's experience with regard to this? I know it sounds silly but I'm just worried about starting the process and want to know what to expect to set my mind at ease.

It‚Äôs so damn difficult and terrifying!,"I tried shooting for the first time ever last night, following the guide here on the side bar and did everything right. I registered a vein, then I came out of it on accident before I could push down, and then couldn‚Äôt get it to register again so I just gave up after like 6 pokes. 

I‚Äôve hit my friend before but it seems it‚Äôs easier on someone else than it is on yourself.


How do people handle that everyday? The action of poking myself was borderline traumatic. I have track marks and I didn‚Äôt even get to get high from shooting. The whole experience was awful. 0/10 would never do again. I could tell that when I hit the vein that first time and some Oxy got in there because I felt it and tasted it without pushing down the plunger. I did some coke (first time doing some in 4 years) after I failed shooting my Oxy and I mixed the bloody Oxywater with the coke and sprayed it up my nostrils. 


Overall, yesterday was a pretty miserable day as I only had 1 30 when I woke up (snorted) and 1 30 before bed (when I did the coke). 

I‚Äôve kind of lost the point of this except that maybe this could be classified as a trip experience but I do not recommend trying to shoot by yourself the first time. I had a horrible experience. If you are absolutely determined to shoot, have a friend show you. I had a friend who could‚Äôve showed me but I was too ashamed to admit I was going to try it.

I feel opiate addiction like that.

For me, which I have to say cause it is pc and I am guaranteed to piss somebody off, but of course what I really mean is all of you guys, life as an addict was that fantasy.

Yes, there were certainly periods where I was functional. Other periods, not so much. But during all of it, I just had this sense that life was passing me by.

Hi life, how are you?

Fine, thanks. And you?

Me? Well you know. I am dreaming. I am feeling no pain, thank you Gordon Lightfoot.

I am reading posts by some younger guys, telling tales about their lives. And they are saying they are in love with heroin and they want nothing else.

What the fuck do you say to that?

Just say no? That really does not go over very well.

I‚Äôm taking a nap.

After taking that methadone and smoking that cigarette. Usually, I‚Äôm nodded out on a good hit of dope after getting back home from the trap but not today. This afternoon I‚Äôm just resting up before getting ready to meet Leticia‚Äôs family, and something about the methadone lets me dream more vividly than I usually do when I‚Äôve done heroin. So, I‚Äôm lying there and dreaming that my dad is calling me on one of those old phones with one of those old school curly cords. He‚Äôs excited. He‚Äôs almost shouting about how he woke up at three a.m. to cook his favorite chocolate muffins. My dad wants me to give him a haircut later. I don‚Äôt cut hair. Never have. It doesn‚Äôt make sense. Dreams never really do, but my dad is so proud of his muffins in the dream, and he‚Äôs so happy about the haircut, and the whole thing is so, so real to me that I‚Äôm openly weeping. I am wailing over the line, because I miss him so badly.

And then I wake up. Whimpering like a dog. And sit up. Light a cigarette and take a minute to reconcile the very real grief in my heart and the tears on my face and the conversation I just had with my dad on the phone about his muffins with the reality of my empty apartment and the fact that my father has been dead for 14 years now. Still, it takes a minute to swallow it, to let these feelings pass.

I walk to the bathroom. And strip. Take a shower. Get out. Dry off and wipe the fog from the mirror to shave my stubble. Brush my teeth, and after that I stand there staring into the mirror and making funny faces and silly voices quoting lines from movies and things like that, until I finally tell myself what I really want to say, what I really feel and think about myself, which is,

‚ÄúI hate you,‚Äù and continue getting dressed in the living room.

Now, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve told you that I keep large bags of brand-new socks and boxers to wear. When I‚Äôm finished, I put them in a trash bag. My plan is to have Sharky or Charlie take them to the Goodwill or one of the secondhand stores, soon. And it‚Äôs funny, because just as I‚Äôm thinking about when the next time I‚Äôll see them, there‚Äôs a knocking at my door.

It‚Äôs the sort of obnoxious knocking that I associate with Sharky. It‚Äôs a heavy policelike pounding, whereas Charlie just taps. And Sal is the only other person who knows where I live, but he just meets me at the room every morning. So, I know it‚Äôs not him. And it‚Äôs not Charlie. It‚Äôs Sharky.

So, I open the door. Sharky is standing there. He walks right in and hands me a piece of paper. It says something written in permanent marker.

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù Sharky says. ‚ÄúFound this taped to your door. Weird message, bro. What‚Äôs that about?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou read it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I just saw it. It was right out in the open. Kinda hard not to read it, don‚Äôt ya think?‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess. Let me see‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I hold the piece of paper out in front of me and see the piece of tape hanging off the top of it. The print is strangely familiar. It‚Äôs the same crude handwriting that had been on that note taped to the door at the motel a month ago. Maybe, it‚Äôs been longer. I can‚Äôt remember. Either way, though, the last one was a warning, and so is this one.

It goes like this:

Hey Weenus,

We told you before. This is your last warning. We know what you‚Äôre doing. Knock it off, or you‚Äôre going to pay the price. Last chance.

Last time this anonymous group, who I imagine as angry and adolescent boys, left me a letter it, it addressed me as Dill Hole. I guess Weenus is better. Not really sure how I feel about that, but either way, anxiety creeps in. This makes me feel so weird and worried. It‚Äôs almost like it has to be a joke.

‚ÄúAnyway, bro. I came for a piece.‚Äù Says Sharky.

‚ÄúOk. Sure. What you want?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got a stick on me.‚Äù Stick is what Sharky calls 1000 dollars. He‚Äôs the only person I‚Äôve ever heard call a grand a stick.

‚ÄúOkay. So, the usual, then?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

I go back to the room. Weigh out what he wants. Bring it back to him in the living room and say,

‚ÄúHere you go.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem, man. But, hey. I gotta bounce out right now. Before I go though, will you take this?‚Äù

I pick up the black trash bag full of my dirty socks and underwear.

‚ÄúSure. What is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome dirty clothes.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha. What do I want those for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was wondering if you‚Äôd just take it to the Goodwill and drop it off outside.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.‚Äù

The look on his face makes me second guess asking him to take them down. I thought it was a good deed, but now, I'm thinking maybe they won't want a bunch of dirty boxers and socks.

‚ÄúGood. I appreciate it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Man. Where you off to, anyways?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy‚Ä¶..‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what to call Leticia. Is she my girlfriend? Not yet. My friend? Well, yes, but she‚Äôs also more than that. I don‚Äôt know, so I just say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to meet this girl‚Äôs family. You know?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure. That‚Äôs good, Vonnejunk. You got you a girlfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not my girlfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is she then?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friend. My friend that I want to make my girlfriend.‚Äù

‚ÄúNice. Good luck, dude. See ya later.‚Äù

He slings the trash bag over his shoulder and lets the door slam on his way out. I am so nervous, now that he‚Äôs gone. It‚Äôs like the silence and vacuum allow me to feel what I need to feel. That letter is so harrowing. And that on top of having to go meet Leticia‚Äôs whole family at once. It‚Äôs too much. But I find a belt and put it on. I‚Äôm still buckling it as I walk out the door and finish before I hit the stairway.",1550459458.0

So recently I was cleaning out an old family members home and disposing of belongings, junk, medicine etc, and I came across a rather interesting little pack.
Inside there was an old Webster pack containing 5x 10mg MS Contin pills and 15x 15/7.5 Targin pills. Considering my knowledge on opiates is rather basic and I've only really used Endone and Codeine I grew curious. I've read around a bit and already tested 3 of the Targin pills (very disappointing imo). But I'm still a bit lost on the MS Contin. 

From what I've read, the best way to dose it (MS Contin) is IV or rectally but I've also read that snorting it is a decent option. My main question is that there doesnt seem to be too much information on dosages for snorting it (I mainly use PsychonautWiki). I weigh about 70kgs and I have a small opiod tolerance from what I gather - I rarely exceed 30-40mg Endone at once. What would a good dose be to start with here, and would dosing it around 5-6 hours after taking 45mg of Targin be safe? All replies are appreciated. 

TL;DR: Usual dose of Endone is around 30mg. I have 50mg of MS Contin, what is a good dose for me to start with (via snorting)?",1550459071.0

anyway my question is...and i like to think i have a fairly good grasp on buprenorphine and its mechanism of action, but i find it to be an extremely confusing drug for a number of reasons. i understand that the so-called ""deterrant"" additive naloxone in Suboxone was mostly a marketing gimmick intended to extend¬†Reckitt Benckiser's brand name profits once their patent on Subutex was set to expire, and that precipitated withdrawal is caused by the high binding affinity of the buprenorphine itself and not, as the manufacturer claims, by the naloxone. i understand this is because the naloxone component is supposedly not bioavailable unless injected.

but if that's true, then how does the nasal spray version of Narcan work? does the bupe in Suboxone out-compete the naloxone at the receptor as well as any full agonists? i'm trying to figure out why so many people report failure during Bernese method inductions and whether this is because of the buprenorphine or whether the naloxone is playing a role as well.

i also know that many people (including myself) live in areas where most if not all of the street heroin contains fentanyl, and the consensus is that the Bernese method will not work in this scenario because fentanyl's relative binding affinity is weaker than buprenorphine's - but from what i can see, the reported¬†K·µ¢ values for bupe range drastically from 0.21 nM all the way to 1.8 nM, with smaller values indicating a stronger bind (the¬†K·µ¢ value for fentanyl is 0.39 nM) indicating that in some circumstances bupe can displace fentanyl and in other circumstances it cannot...? i haven't been able to find an explanation for this phenomenon. note i used the [PDSP affinities database for¬†K·µ¢¬†values](https://pdsp.unc.edu/databases/pdsp.php?recDDRadio=recDDRadio&receptorDD=1&receptor=&speciesDD=&species=&sourcesDD=&source=&hotLigandDD=&hotLigand=&testDDRadio=testDDRadio&testLigandDD=988&testLigand=&referenceDD=&reference=&KiGreater=&KiLess=&kiAllRadio=all&doQuery=Submit+Query) for this data.",1550437509.0

Honestly the 6 hydros had started not being enough and the last year has meant several days of pain each month and I'm worried the 4 Oxys will be a step backwards not forward in my pain relief.

I recently got hydromorphone and oxy to try, as a nice change from the usual heroin. Oxy and hydromorphone used to make me feel so high and so euphoric. They both just make me feel sleepy now with absolutely zero good feelings that I used to get. So I guess in the year and a half I've been doing H, my brain chemistry has changed so much that I can't get high anymore. It used to feel amazing, which is obviously why anyone starts doing H. Now it does the opposite of everything it helped me with before. Now I'm always lethargic, antisocial, unmotivated, with no feeling of content or well being. 

I'd like to know how many other people are still doing H just to feel normal, and not get sick. Why does this actually happen? And is there any way to feel good again like now without having to quit? I know taking a break is the obvious answer but I guess I'm just looking for a quick fix and some people to relate to.

I purchased a Kratom Extract powder in advance as I'm most likely going to be taking a break soon, and Kratom is amazing for diminishing 90% of withdrawal side effects. My brain still expects to get high from opioids so that makes it harder to quit. That and the impending doom that is withdrawal. ",1550420639.0

Okay, granted. You did not ask to be born. You did not ask to be genetically predisposed towards addiction. I get that. 

But it happened and then you got hooked up. Then it was on.

So, exactly how much fun did I have during my 11 years as an IV heroin addict? I cannot really say. I nodded during most of it. When I was not asleep or even drunk, I was likely down in the hood, chasing dope and running from the cops. 

One thing I can remember is all the people I betrayed. Yup, pretty clear on that stuff. Family, friends, people I just flat out conned. Funny how those memories stick around. I guess you could say that was not boring. 

I hate it when I run into some guy that I apparently knew and he is like ‚Äì remember when you did fill in the blank? That was some wild shit! Sadly, I must admit that I do not have a clue. I don‚Äôt remember. I was high as fuck.

Now I am clean. I spend my weekdays playing with computers, fixing issues for my clients in a corporate environment. Is it boring? Fuck no, because that guy down in the next cubicle, he has the most amazing stories to tell about what really happened to him when he turned 18, and went to that party at Sara‚Äôs house, and how he should have known better but oh well! 

Or the older guys, who will tell you what really happened in Viet Nam, as they were hanging out of helicopters, absolutely terrified but hoping to make it back to base so they could smoke some heroin and try to forget the insanity.

Or, let us take the absolute most prosaic and boring experience. Going grocery shopping. 

So here is my recommendation. Take your phone with you. Put on some jamming music, but do not use headphones. Just loud enough to be heard while you are shopping.

Do not be surprised if total strangers eyeball you, just casually, wondering what your deal is. And then, you kind of wander over and happen to check out the cucumbers next to that kind of hot girl / guy. 

Who then says to you, ‚ÄúShopping in style, I see. I like it!‚Äù

At which point you break out the big smile, and say something like, ‚ÄúYeah, Nirvana was awesome. Too bad about Kurt, I really loved him.‚Äù

Now it is game on.

There are a thousand variations and this does not even take into account camping, roller coasters, mma, card games, water parks, walking the dog, roller blading, actually playing that guitar you bought where other people can see you playing, and on and on and on and on.

What am I missing here? Do you guys think you are not worthy? Reinvent yourselves. If it is good enough for Madonna and Kanye, it is good enough for you.

If you are bored, you are not really trying. 

However, I am now issuing my standard disclaimer. No need to tell me that I am a condescending asshole and I do not understand your depression, anger issues, bipolar disorder or whatever. 

Trust me, I got my own problems. I am serous. I never said it was easy. It is never easy. ",1550418902.0

Basically, over the course of a year and a half, I worked my way up to being able to take anywhere from 100-150mg of instant release oxyocodone (endone) at a time. I even managed to work my way up to 180mg at once, but that made me feel sick and I went back down. However, I overdosed one time from taking 100mg. I passed out and stopped breathing, went blue and had to have CPR and spent a few days in hospital. Anyway, I'm just wondering as to why I overdosed from 100mg when I had taken 180mg before, and regularly took anywhere from 100-150mg at once. Keep in mind, absolutely all of this oxy was prescribed, so there's no chance it was somehow stronger, or cut with something else etc. I hadn't eaten for maybe 10 hours, and it was just after I had woken up after only a couple of hours of sleep, but I often took it with no food in my stomach, so honestly I have no idea why I overdosed.

So, I Got off work tonight at midnight. Im a cook at a roadhouse in my bumfuck methopolis of a town. Made 20 bucks in tips and my dude hmu while I was there saying boys around (in my area it's not very common just fucking ice.)

I go scoop him we head to the local trap motel to meet his friend because she has some and I just need a 20.

Get there and she has 2 grey chunks sitting on the table ready to crush and snort I do it and get high kinda high. We talk you know typical shooting the shit lol. Then, She gives me more lines, I probably snort a point and a half free then she takes my money and puts out a little for me to bag.

She has no scales... Because she doesn't ever sell shit. She doesn't want to fuck me so she just says grab some more out my bag I trust you. Fuck yeah I get lil powder and a big chunk and she says yeah that's fine no prob.

Tolerance built quickly and for the past couple years at least Ive been on a dose of at least 1g a day.  Usually much higher.  The 8 months prior to the last 6 weeks I was using more like 3-5gs a day.  Very sure it's been fentadope.  For the past 6 weeks Ive been chipping.  Stretching like a g for 2 days and then not getting more for another two days.  During that time I've also had several longer clean runs.  5, 6 and 7 days.  The withdrawal has been surprisingly manageable if not negligible each time.  Although part of me is afraid I'm gonna get blindsided like day 8 or 9.  This time I'm staying off the boy for good though. Approaching 48  hours since my last line already.  Feeling good all things considered.  Even when I took a week off I could see improvement by day 7 and the symptoms were never sever.  Just a little achey, restless, anxious, sleepless, etc...   Nothing really bar though.  No idea how that is.  Been through detox before and I know I'm not one of those superhuman folks that doesn't feel it.   Wifey is going through the same thing and also only feels moderate symptoms.  Maybe it's the chipping, maybe it's something to do with the dope.  Guess we will see.  Regardless wish us well.  Positive vibes are much appreciated.

But i dont have any illusions any doctor will be sympathetic. Even if i say im gonna go cop fent dope. I dont want to get on methadone or subs. I just want to get hjgh, one fuckin time and go on with my life as before. It isnt right to deal with these feelings in my head and just ignore it. I feel like im going to lose my mind.

But I am wondering if it might actually hinder the recreational value, by reducing euphoria. I have tried to use morphine/opium while on an SARI called Trazodone and that completely negated the euphoria, but Trazodone works differently and affects the receptors that are responsible for releasing dopamine. I know that these medications do work on the same enzyme as codeine does to turn into morphine and would probably screw that process up, but as far as I know, SSRIs/SNRIs shouldn't really affect morphine/opium as it does not need to do that and go through that enzyme.

It was three and half days ago now that I ran out of subs. Since then i've been smoking black tar. about two .2 bags worth. Before this I had been taking about 12 mg of suboxone a day for almost a YEAR now. I am heavily dependent on it. The H was able to subdue any withdrawals from subs for the time I was taking it. I am now out, and hoping that with my move back to suboxone I can take less of a dose to retrieve the same results.

&#x200B;

Now MOST people will say 24 hours when going from H to subs, BUT they are not in my scenario. A scenario where I had been taking a good sized dose of sub for a year, and only moved to H for 3 and a half days... In order to experience PWDs, i imagine the person has to be completely dependent upon the drug they are currently taking. But at this point in time, that drug has only been in my system for again, 3 and half days. Whats the procedure here? I imagine there is definitely some sub left in my system, but H at this point has probably moved on to the receptor site.

EDIT: its actually been closer to 4 days now since my last dose or 96 hours.

Lol just .25mg Xanax and this will be for this evening. I‚Äôm feeling super anxious today and short tempered. Prolly PMSüò© Took my dose around 9am. So, it‚Äôs been 8 hours. I don‚Äôt have a tolerance to Xanax. Only have taken it here or there in low doses (.50mg) when I miss my dose and need to get to sleep or take the edge off my anxiety. 

Just looking for advice. Is this low dose okay or is it still deadly this low? 

Took 15mg methadone around 9 and would take the .25mg Xanax around 5pm.

I don‚Äôt want to take my opiate pain killers (not that they helped much anyways....) that I take daily just because Im planning to get clean of ALL opiates at the end of this month.

I'm currently on medication to help me get off heroin but before that, when I was at the peak of my addiction I would use 14-20 bags a day. Normally I would do 2-3 bags when I first copped that day because I had a lot. But as you know heroin addiction is a full time thing and there are no breaks or days off. So I would have to make my supply last until I could cop again. So if I bought a 14 bag bundle I would do a 3 bag shot then do a few more 2 bag shots every couple of hours. I would have to save at least 1 or 2 bags for the morning before I got my shit together to go cop again. When I had enough money I would buy 2 bundles (28 bags) at a time and use 20 or 21 in one day and save the other 7 for the next day. I liked the stamp bags because I could measure out how much I had and it was easy to ration it out.

I never did more than 4 bags at a time. I could be nodding off of that for the most part I had to be functioning because I worked and I had to hide it from family and friends. When I would buy in bulk and tell myself I would stretch it for a few days I always ended up doing more. In the early days of my addiction I had a friend I would run with. We would split a bundle and I would watch him slam 7 bags and be out of it for a while but 5 hours later he was looking to cop again and I'd still have a few. Sadly that guy isn't around anymore. Went to Florida to get clean and never came back. Well that's not true, he did come back...in a coffin.

This dude in front of me had those wounds on his face from picking at imaginary lice... or whatever the fuck his drug addled mind told him they were.  This poor wretch of a man didn‚Äôt realize he was signaling to everyone that saw him that he was deep into meth and he didn‚Äôt GAF what they thought. However, what‚Äôs far more interesting about this man, that no one else is noticing but me, is the fact that he is in line waiting to cash the check that is held tightly in his hand. I can only see a few of the numbers on the check.. and that‚Äôs a good thing, because it goes, 246_??  That means there is another number behind that 6 before the decimal point comes out and says, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough money for him‚Äù. That decimal point appears a lot sooner in the series of numbers on my check and that has had me in a bad mood all morning. I was expecting more and the reason I got less is still too raw for me to get into sober, I‚Äôll have to write that part later today when my mind is in a better place.  I pull myself back from going down the path of getting pissed off all over again about why that fucking decimal point is where it is.. meth head shuffling toward the cashier springs me from my dark revelry and I start making my plan.  He cashes his check and I leave the line to follow him.. from a safe distance at first but I know something most people don‚Äôt... I could walk 1 foot behind this dude and he wouldn‚Äôt notice anything. His shuffle has gotten a little more coordinated now that he‚Äôs cashed his check and his gait has straightened out some now that he‚Äôs walking faster.  He‚Äôs being powered by the thoughts of his DOC being another step closer to being in his grubby hands.  I am sure that he‚Äôs carrying a couple monkeys on his back that need to be fed. Some monkeys take priority over other monkeys but eventually they all need to be fed.  As I weigh my options and formulate my strategy, it‚Äôs impossible not to remember the last lick and how terribly wrong it went, so wrong that it‚Äôs haunting me.. haunting me in more ways than one. My soon to be victim is buying some candy and energy drinks, I observe him from a distance while he finishes his meal planning for the day and bags up his lunch and dinner, I follow him out of the store and I can‚Äôt help but be impressed at his remarkable improvement in posture. We are both walking faster than the throngs of people coming in and out of the store and we get bottle necked at the store‚Äôs exit, people are coming in the exit because that‚Äôs where some genius put all the carts and people are exiting the same way with full carts.. a traffic jam of people has now put me right up against his back, jammed shoulder to shoulder with all the other shoppers, we are packed in like the GA section of a rock show. I am getting pushed from the back and sides as people regress from a sense of community to one of competition.. like getting thru the door first is worth shoving the person next to you. And then it happened. The annoyance of the concentrated humanity was actually a gift. As the bottle necked crowd of people jammed tighter I put my hand, ever so gently, down into the same jacket pocket that just a few minutes earlier my meth head mark had put his wallet and all the cash that his check, with it‚Äôs well placed decimal point, entitled him to. The wallet came up and out of his pocket and then down and in to mine with ease and grace. Thou shall not steal flashed thru my mind, ruining the elation I was feeling from my unexpected come-up. The crowded exit opened up enough for me to slip past a few people and put some distance between me and my mark. I walked briskly towards my car, noticing that my posture had also improved. My head was up and shoulders back, semi speed walking thru the parking lot and finally to my car. Worst case scenarios, as usual, running thru my head. My moral compass isn‚Äôt broken, I feel guilt for the poor bastard that I just jacked. But my mind is sharp and I am a rational person, I chase away the feelings of guilt by thinking about how many people my mark has probably robbed, or worse, to support his habit. Ours is a Dog eat dog world and it‚Äôs kill or be killed.  I am now Freshly emboldened by my acceptance of what really just happened, I didn‚Äôt jack that guy for selfish reasons, I jacked him to avenge his victims, to right his wrongs. The situation was presented to me as the result of some karmic action, the universe righting itself by allowing me to turn that predator, with all his past sins, in to a victim. I get into my car with complete acceptance of this much more palatable, personal paradigm and the sense of calm I now feel is evolving in to excitement as I drive out of the parking lot and onto the highway. I open meth head‚Äôs wallet and find out exactly what number came after the 6, it was another 6..  for a grand total of $2466. The wave of happiness and excitement starts in my gut and quickly spreads out to my extremities... what a fucking come up!  I exhale long and loud, every muscle in my body relaxes, knowing that for the next week or more I won‚Äôt have to risk my freedom or my life while trying to keep my monkey fed.  

What do you guys think?  If anyone is interested in reading more and doesn‚Äôt think my story is shit, I‚Äôll write about what happened next

Yeah, the thing give you seizures, but my go-to doses are low enough that I highly doubt this would be a risk, considering I'm not seizure-prone. Maybe it's all the weird shit it does with serotonin and noripinephrine and whatever the fuck else it screws with, but it just scratches an itch that other opiates don't for me.

It's also a great functional drug, destroys anxiety better than benzos and actually fills me with motivation to do shit. Only downsides are the pretty harsh nausea/appetite supression and the weird sleep you get on it, sort of like a permament half-asleep state, though I actually kind of enjoy that too.

But ‚Äì what if the opiate epidemic just got too out of control? What if people decided they were fed up with our bullshit, our scamming doctors, stealing, lying, all the violence associated with opiate use, cartels subverting governments, the silver or the lead, etc etc etc?

What if, instead of 30,000 dead, it was 100,000?

What if 1,000,000 were disabled by opiate abuse ( a 1:10 dead to wounded ration. Not unbelievable).

Naltrexone is already a big deal. In addition to saving addict lives and ruining your high, there are the following benefits for regular people:

Naltrexone Treats Fibromyalgia Symptoms

Naltrexone Reduces Pain and Swelling in Rheumatoid Arthritis

Naltrexone Amplifies Anticonvulsant and Anti-Pain Effects of Drugs

Naltrexone Effectively Treats Irritable Bowel Syndrome

Naltrexone May Help Fight Cancer

These are all real things, that naltrexone, in various forms and dosages, is being used for.

Starting to get the picture?

I am far from that conspiracy theory guy. Sorry, the earth is not flat. The illuminati do not rule the earth (well, maybe they rule Nebraska) and Bigfoot is not real.

However, I think it could be in the realm of possibility to see antagonist legislation passed at some point.

If addicts get too out of control and enough bodies drop, I can see mandatory antagonist vaccines or some variation enacted by law.

I suppose, if medically cleared, they would have a ready means of reversing this for pain treatment or whatever.

Do I believe this would happen? No, not really. Then again, I didn‚Äôt get here by being the smartest or sanest guy in the world.

I was reading the following article few days a go:

[https://forum.drugs-and-users.org/index.php/topic,4489.0.html](https://forum.drugs-and-users.org/index.php/topic,4489.0.html)

&#x200B;

Short extract from article:

""In addition, this compound also was effective at blocking abuse potential of prescription opioids, much like buprenorphine does for heroin, so we hope it could be used to treat pain and opioid abuse.""  
Ko and fellow researchers developed AT‚Äì121 in their attempts to find a molecule that could act upon two key receptors in the brain: the mu opioid receptor, which conventional opioids and prescription painkillers target, and the nociceptin receptor, which regulates various brain activities, including feelings of addiction and chemical dependence.  
In theory, an agonist that could successfully bind to both these receptors could promote sensations of pain relief without inviting the severe addiction that opioids often arouse.

""We developed AT‚Äì121 that combines both activities in an appropriate balance in one single molecule, which we think is a better pharmaceutical strategy than to have two drugs to be used in combination,"" Ko says.

Early results are positive. In tests with rhesus monkeys, AT‚Äì121 appeared to deliver pain relief equivalent to morphine, but at a dosage 100 times lower.  
It also did so non-addictively, but more than that, when the compound was given to animals who had developed a dependence on the opioid oxycodone, it actually reduced their level of addiction, suggesting AT‚Äì121 might be able to help patients wean themselves off other drugs at the same time as treating their pain. 

&#x200B;

## Rabies concentrates itself in the saliva and nervous system of its hosts, thereby, causing its host to infect others with the virus through biting. Interestingly it seems to have an intelligent strategy in spreading itself from its hosts to others. The facts associated with different kinds of super bugs, hemorrhagic fever and the disproportionate number of white women from the states of Texas and California having Morgellon‚Äôs disease fascinate me. Recreational research of diseases can be fun, but first-hand experiences with them are not. I have had Hepatitis C, multiple abscesses, one infected deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis in my arm and what may have been sarcoptic mange once, but the worst disease I ever had was my own self. It was even worse than the time MRSA devoured my spine and that epidural abscess almost crushed it.

When Angie, Cade and I got off the bus, we scored 3 20-dollar balloons of heroin first thing from a guy outside of Powell‚Äôs bookstore. It was Saturday night, and drunken college students littered the sidewalks outside of the bars in the night. Cigarette smoke and slurred conversation filled the air and came from people who had no idea what life was like for my kind. They would go back to their beds in their apartments after spending 100 dollars at the bar. I would sleep on the cold concrete in one of the doorways down the street with my head inches from the puddles they would tromp their stylish leather shoes through on the way home.

We all split up, and I lost my piece of heroin in a Pita Pit bathroom. The bars closed when I found Cade and tried to sleep on the pavement next to him. Unlike the place we came from, we did not know the ins and outs of homelessness in this new place. We had played like kids on a jungle gym in the city we lived in before but didn‚Äôt even know where to find cardboard to sleep on.

Angie found us in the morning, and we got high one more time before we parted ways for good. I lived at the Joyce while my parents paid the rent, because I promised them that I was taking every possible step to get into a place called Hooper detox. Truthfully, I had never been there or even called, and I wasn‚Äôt taking any steps to get in.

I paid 50 something dollars a night, but I told them it cost 80 and used the extra to buy heroin. The dive from paying 20 bucks for 300 milligrams of morphine on pill hill in the Tenderloin to the 20-dollar mouse turds of mediocre heroine I bought from the guy on the 3rd floor of the Joyce was hard to stomach. It never gave me what I wanted, and I was sick by 4 every morning. I did a lot of rinses to pass the time and injected some ashy water in my forearm on afternoon.

That night I got cotton fever. It started like always with sweaty chills and severe bone and muscle aches. My head pounded and the shakes steadily grew with a kidney pain. The shakes turned into jerking convulsions and lifted me off the bed like Linda Blair. I puked on the floor and sheets. My mouth and throat parched till my lips stuck together. I cried for water. I tried to drink and wretched it all back up a second later. I puked and pooped in the common shower down the hall. My head and kidneys hurt so bad I cried and puked some more. I did not sleep. ‚ÄúAt least Ebola kills you.‚Äù I thought to myself as the sun came up. CNN showed Gaddafi bloodied and beaten by his enemies. He had been captured in Libya.

My parents sent the money for the day, and the dealer had to make change in his room after he gave me the 20-dollar balloon. While I cooked up my hit, a pebbly slime rose in my chest, and I almost peed my pants. I grabbed the small trashcan to pee into and puked into it simultaneously. A large squirt of diarrhea ran down my leg, and it took a second to collect myself, before I did the shot. My dealer met me in the hallway with the 60 dollars for rent on my way to the shower.

After the shower, I watched TV for a while and tried to relax. When I went to pay rent at the front desk I realized that I had left the money in the bathroom. It was gone, and I told management that I had to go pick up another Western Union at Safeway. My dad yelled at me over the phone about having to send more money.

I wore the only thing in my room that wasn‚Äôt plastered with excrement, a pair of pajama pants, completely ripped from the crotch and down the leg and no underwear. It was cold and the 10 blocks back to Safeway were embarrassing while I tried to keep the thin, ripped fabric from exposing my private parts on the street. I waited two hours for the money, but when I returned to the Joyce management kicked me out for finding a syringe under my bed and the smell coming out of the trashcan. They seemed to think that I was defecating in it. The front desk clerk, an inadequate type with thick rimmed glasses, a skinny neck and a buzz cut, told me about finding an overdosed body in one of the rooms last week and gave me a pair of jeans that were too small. The pink and white frosting on my animal cookies provoked my guts to gurgling again while I listened. Perhaps, the treat was a bit premature.

&#x200B;

For the next three mornings, I walked to the MAX in the dark and took the red line to the Rose Quarter.  Being new to town, I thought it seemed like an amazing place to live.  It was progressive and of a size somewhere between a town and a city.  It boasted one of the top public transit systems in the nation.  Everyone bought their milk and eggs from the farmer‚Äôs markets and rode retro fixed gear bikes with skinny tires and smoked weed.  However cool of a place it was to live, I still slept outside, and it would never be that cool for me.       But at least I was finally fulfilling my promise to my parents about trying to get into the detox, and I slept in an asphalt parking lot with a jacket over my legs through the cold nights.  Hooper took me in on the third morning, but the day before that, my arm turned into a thick piece of oak firewood, hard and swollen and excruciating.  The ER at Good Samaritan Hospital told me it was cellulitis, and when I first got there the doctors and nurses sneered at the smell in the room.  Fish scales of hardened, dead skin covered the soles of my feet from the black and white Adidas I found and had worn for weeks without socks. 

The medical detox at Hooper was easy for me, except that no amount of washing my feet helped. It became an unsettling stench that started light, but the longer I sat in any one place, everyone had to ask, ‚ÄúWhat is that smell? Whoah! What is that?‚Äù I watched movies, ate graham crackers and drank milk, until they gave out Trazodone at eight p.m. After seven days I took my last two milligrams of buprenorphine and left three days later to a sober living facility called the 8x8.

Men and women who had struggled with addiction or alcoholism lived in the tiny rooms of the 8x8. Each room had a kitchenette and toilet. The city paid our rent so long as we attended five meetings a week and stayed sober. I lived on the sixth floor, and all but one girl on the floor had already relapsed.

My first two weeks there something in my spine hurt like I never hurt before, and I took 24 IB profens every six hours to sleep. My stomach bled inside from the pills, and everyone said that I should go to the ER. I refused to go but moaned and wailed loudly every night in the lobby of the 8x8. The black lady who worked the front desk at night couldn‚Äôt stand it or me for that matter. It was easily the worst pain of my entire life, and when my mom came to visit me on Thanksgiving Day, she said,

‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs face looks like yours does, that doesn‚Äôt need to go to the hospital.‚Äù

We took a taxi to Good Samaritan to see what they said. It was my idea that after the CT scan I would go smoke a cigarette, but they said,

‚ÄúYou have infected discs in your back, and it looks like some vertebral osteomyelitis. That‚Äôs infected bone. We‚Äôll get you up to a room as soon as we can and start a round of antibiotics now. I was going to give you some dilaudid, but your mother says you‚Äôre a recovering addict, so we‚Äôll stick with Percocet, ten milligrams every 6 hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm. So, can I go smoke now?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

I needed a cigarette. Ten milligrams of Percocet every five minutes couldn‚Äôt touch my tolerance or the pain. My back hurt, and I thought my mom should have minded her own business.

‚ÄúWell, Momma, you know what I think, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. What do you think, Riley?‚Äù

‚ÄúF\*\*\* this s\*\*\* show is what the f\*\*\* I think! Just a bunch of stupid mother***ers around here!‚Äù I reminded myself of Buffalo, and the doctor shrugged before she walked out of the room. ‚ÄúMother f***er!‚Äù

On the third floor of the hospital my mom brought me Thai food and several bottles of IB profen, but it wasn‚Äôt long before the doctors discovered the IB profen and took it from me. They said 4800 milligrams every six hours was not good for me, even if it was the only thing that worked. Later that night I chased my mom out of the room, slammed the door and threw my dinner tray on the floor, so the doctors wrote me an order for three milligrams of liquid morphine. It didn‚Äôt work, and they seemed surprised that I wasn‚Äôt more thankful.

The next afternoon I got an EKG to see if I had vegetative growths on my heart valves, otherwise known as endocarditis. If I did, things were worse than I could imagine, but while the tech and his helper ran a piece of cold metal through the slime on my chest, one of my friends from the 8x8 showed up with some heroine. I demanded to use the bathroom, and after a minute I pulled my friend into the bathroom in front of the technicians and locked the door. We took 15 minutes to fix, so the nurse knocked and made me, ‚ÄúCOME OUT OF THERE, NOW!‚Äù

At one a.m. a few days later my legs tingled and quit working so well. I couldn‚Äôt use the bathroom, so a middle aged blonde woman came in and gave me a catheter. The night doctor ordered another MRI. I could not even move my feet an inch by the time they rolled me down the hall. My blood pressure skyrocketed, and in the morning my regular doctors came to see me. The Asian one asked me if I thought four milligrams of dilaudid would be enough, or if I wanted more. To make my point about not drug seeking I asked for two milligrams, and I cried.

I told the anesthesiologist in the OR,

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had surgery before.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôll be fine, sweetie. Can you count from 100 backwards for me?‚Äù

‚Äú100‚Ä¶‚Ä¶99‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.98‚Ä¶‚Ä¶97‚Ä¶.96‚Ä¶95‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I woke up to feel the warmth of the fentanyl evaporating and sweaty desperation forming on my brow. There were new pains in my back from where the surgeon laid open the meat and used power tools to cut into my vertebra and sowed a seam of fishing line through the skin over my spine. A pretty x-ray tech slid a cold metal case behind me shortly after I woke up, and I screamed. Different nurses brought me dilaudid and morphine every few hours. After five days of sleepy agony, I slid out of bed and used my walker and arms to get my first shower with my mom‚Äôs help. Before I left a lady used a sonogram to run a thin rubber tube through a vein in my arm into my heart called a PICC line. It was painless, and I was never supposed to mess with it for fear of infection or affecting my heart. A mesh band held the capped nozzle against the skin of my upper arm, and a week after the surgery my mother helped move me into an assisted living facility.

I shuffled with my walker everywhere I went.

It took me fifteen days before I could walk unassisted, and my own toes only tripped me up occasionally. 23 days after surgery I had my first bowel movement and had not gone for several days before that. The resident doctor at the retirement home stopped in to see me.

‚ÄúHow are you doing?‚Äù ‚ÄúGood. What happened to your arm, Doc?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had a skiing accident. It‚Äôs okay though. I‚Äôll be out of this sling in a few weeks. How are you doing coming off of the dilaudid? When was your last dose? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶..‚Äù

‚ÄúUm. I think yesterday morning. I think I feel okay. You know? I mean the doctor at the hospital told me that a lot of people think child birth or kidney stones are the most painful things a person can go through, but she said that‚Äôs because epidural abscesses are so rare.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. That‚Äôs for sure. I can‚Äôt imagine what that‚Äôs like, but you say you feel okay for now without the dilaudid?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Doc. I‚Äôm feeling okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Well I‚Äôm going to get a drug test from you. Let the nurse know when you are ready to pee.‚Äù

The surprise of a drug test made me paranoid, so I saved a bottle of pee in a bottle in case they ever gave me another one. It was more boring and comfortable in the retirement home than the streets, but it was as sad. The eerie stink and dread of leather skinned shadows leaked into the hallway while they waited for death in their rooms. Sometimes I caught glimpses of straight faced families staring at the floor and sitting around the grey skeleton of their grandfather in bed, his mouth open, his eyes absent, a tangle of tubes and wires running from him to softly beeping machines. The swollen-eyed nurses lost two or three patients a week.

The retirement home wanted to send me home after six weeks of antibiotics, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to give up my PICC line or hospital bed or cable TV or the morphine, so I demanded that they send me back to Good Samaritan for an MRI. The results showed that my spine had only deteriorated since I arrived at the facility, and the doctor wrote me orders for six mg of dilaudid every four hours and upped my morphine besides adding Ativan, as needed.

An old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet, and at night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroine.

My nurses all knew I was high but couldn‚Äôt figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.

‚ÄúSo, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you‚Äôll be out of here.‚Äù Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄúOkay. Well, aren‚Äôt you sending it to a lab?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôll know what‚Äôs in my system, right? You‚Äôll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. We‚Äôll know you were doing heroin and you‚Äôll be gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I won‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, you will, and then you‚Äôll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I do. Get the f\*\*\* out of my room and leave me the f\*\*\* alone until you have those results! I‚Äôm watching cartoons!‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn‚Äôt hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central Roasts and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn‚Äôt love her like she loved him. Other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump when she lingered awkwardly talking to me.

Back home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. We watched my new favorite movie Drive with Ryan Gosling and Brian Cranston when he came, and he brought a king cake for the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and he attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my haircut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, ‚ÄúBoy! You got me all turned on, and I‚Äôm black!‚Äù

Over the phone he told me what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We watched the numbers of my erythrocyte sedimentation rate closest and felt relieved when it went down. He saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled in New Orleans.

I gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt like nothing but sober.

Between flights my dad called me,

‚ÄúSeems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks‚Äô home you were living in.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? How do you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I still have it in.‚Äù

‚ÄúS\*\*\*! Riley!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôll take it out myself.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about that. I think that‚Äôs dangerous. Let‚Äôs figure it out when you get here.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Sounds good. We‚Äôre about to take off.‚Äù I walked to the aircraft‚Äôs bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.

My luggage got lost on the plane, but a man delivered it all by three a.m. There were a few morphine pills in my bags, so I took them as soon as they showed up. In the morning my mom took me to get my dilaudid prescription filled, but since it was from Oregon they would only fill the morphine and Ativan, no dilaudid. I refused to get the morphine filled as some sort of self-destructive protest but insisted on the Ativan. An old roach from one of my parents‚Äô parties gave me a head change, before my sisters took me to eat lunch at Frankie and Johnny‚Äôs.

My sisters kept looking down and putting their hands over their eyes when I talked to the waitress. They said, ‚ÄúCome on, Riley! Stop!‚Äù They found my attitude and tone appalling. The younger one laughed at the effects of marijuana on my eyes mixed with the onset of severe opiate withdrawals on my body, slowly turning into a broken slinky. At the house, my sisters tried to watch Bridesmaids with me, but I passed out during the part where they got food poisoning.

I woke up in the bed on the third floor, but I thought I must have showered with my clothes on and got right into bed at some point in the night and forgot about it. My sheets were dripping wet. I dreamed of swimming. Streaks of brown clay lined the white tile in the bathroom by the toilet, but I didn‚Äôt remember getting up before then. I snuck downstairs and stole 14 dollars out of my mom‚Äôs purse and her car keys. I guzzled half a bottle of red cough syrup even though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt do anything for me.

At a Chevron, the crack head riding with me jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted 40 dollars. She told me to drive to a few other places in Pigeon town and jumped out to check inside of different houses. I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup, all over the interior of my mother‚Äôs Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of thin liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto before the sun came up. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.

I continued to vomit on myself and didn‚Äôt even try to keep my bowels under control on the drive home. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to die. I‚Äôm going to die.‚Äù I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth and warm liquid spreading across the seat of my pants.

My father met me at the front door. He knew I stole the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn‚Äôt get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me water, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm about to s\*\*\*!‚Äù I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me. A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Portland. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time. He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die. I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom‚Äôs car, 14 bucks from her purse, drank a half bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, soiled the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning. This was exactly why I had not been home for the last three years.

They let me out before I ever had a solid stool, which my dad said was wrong, and the following week I went to visit my father‚Äôs mother, Turkey. I got a hold of some 30 milligram Oxy and needed money, so I set up a visit with Turkey. He took me to eat at Popeye‚Äôs. It had been over three years since I had seen him. His bottom eyelids hung loose from his eyeballs, and he used a cane. He was much older than I had ever known him to be. I asked him for money, and he asked me why I needed it. We both knew I was lying, but he gave me a few bucks before he left.

My parents could only have me home for a few weeks before they insisted that I enter a yearlong rehab called Bridge House. It was free and boasted an extremely high success rate among its graduates. I told my parents that I wasn‚Äôt using, even though I would disappear for hours and get caught lying about where I was. My sister caught me bouncing (falling asleep and waking up 40-50 times a minute, while standing) one night, and I shared a needle at one of the gas stations with a random. Seals and Croft played on the radio, and beads of sweat rolled down my cheeks. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.

I knew I contracted HIV from it and went into Bridge House a few days later. In one week I smoked my carton of Camel filters and got caught up in some commotion involving a guy called Long Beach threatening to stab another client with a pair of scissors. We took off together. A few days later my mom bought me a ticket back to Portland. I don‚Äôt know what they thought I would do there, but at least I would be far away.",1550291449.0

Great. I said ""fuck it, it's my birthday. No one will ever know"", so I sent it.
  
  I was rocked on the van ride and my boy noticed. He called me out on it that night and I admitted. TBH i had a year clean before and knew I couldnt stay sober on a lie. I decided to get honest with admin at the rehab. Why not right? If I didnt, then my whole stay would be a joke in my mind. It woulda been all fake, guilt would've got to me and ruin me. So they kick me out. 
     They Drop me at the hotel I am now writing this in, and they tell me ""call admissions in the morning and they might let you back in"". I'm banking on that. Because I spent my last $120 on this room hoping they will pick me up and let me back in tomorrow. 

     If you made it this far thank you, idk why I'm writing this. But i plan on calling 2moro morning and asking to be let back in. Just a long vent. Hmu, I got nothing till the am haha.

This is scary stuff and I feel sure, just the beginning.

OpenAI, a non-profit research company investigating ""the path to safe artificial intelligence,"" has developed a machine learning system called Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2 ), capable of generating text based on brief writing prompts. The result comes so close to mimicking human writing that it could potentially be used for ""deepfake"" content. Built based on 40 gigabytes of text retrieved from sources on the Internet (including ""all outbound links from Reddit, a social media platform, which received at least 3 karma""), GPT-2 generates plausible ""news"" stories and other text that match the style and content of a brief text prompt.

The performance of the system was so disconcerting, now the[ researchers are only releasing a reduced version of GPT-2](https://blog.openai.com/better-language-models/#sample2) based on a much smaller text corpus. In a blog post on the project and this decision, researchers Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, Rewon Child, David Luan, Dario Amodei, and Ilya Sutskever wrote:

>Due to concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale, we are only releasing a¬†[much smaller version of GPT-2 along with sampling code](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/). We are not releasing the dataset, training code, or GPT-2 model weights. Nearly a year ago we wrote in the¬†[OpenAI Charter](https://blog.openai.com/openai-charter/): ‚Äúwe expect that safety and security concerns will reduce our traditional publishing in the future, while increasing the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research,‚Äù and we see this current work as potentially representing the early beginnings of such concerns, which we expect may grow over time. This decision, as well as our discussion of it, is an experiment: while we are not sure that it is the right decision today, we believe that the AI community will eventually need to tackle the issue of publication norms in a thoughtful way in certain research areas.",1550279855.0

I had sinus surgery today and the docs gave me percocet for pain.  I don't mind it, I've had it before, although it's not my prefered pain management drug.  I usually use THC edibles, but I've stopped them before the surgery, definitely going back when I get home.  The whole point of this post was to ask a question.  Has anyone else noticed an increase in irritability while on it and other opioids?  Or am I just weird? ",1550276080.0

Still sober today.  Two years ago came into a huge stash of Percocet after finding a bottle of a hundred in a kitchen cabinet at home.  Months of use ensued ending with me telling all my kids and family about it and asking them to not leave any leftover meds where junky pops might find them.  Cold turkey detox before telling anyone what happened.

Those months included impacted bowels to where my wife literally had to go in there with tongs to get things going and laying in a tub of hot water and shit and tears of relief when finally I was able to shit.  Urine retention toilet nodding going to work with what felt like a pole up my ass because I couldn‚Äôt shit.  That was my normal.

Two cold turkey alone detox.  Second time I googled to find out how to make it easier and laid on the loperamide and upped my usual SSRNI.  I already take tamezapam  for life long insomnia and SSRNI for PTSD.  

It‚Äôs been a year since I last used though to be honest it‚Äôs been a year since the stash ran dry.  So I read this sub avidly and it helps with my daily dose of thinking about opioids EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.  

No physical needs, I live in constant pain of old injuries, arthritis and an aging body.  Physical pain does not bother me. But damn the constant nagging whining want want want in my brain is exhausting.  Every day.  Emotional mental cravings?  

I go to the hood 7-11 for my chips and cream soda and scope out who I think may be a hook.  I surf the onion and peruse ads and opened a bitcoin account. Only to find out I can‚Äôt send for 18 days so that immediate thing doesn‚Äôt happen.  Thank God. 

I am a true crime fan and was following this one horrific trial and discovered the killers got a retrial because the judge was hooked on oxy and there he was on the bench nodding.  And fuck me but that‚Äôs messed up.  

But that got me through another day of keeping this monkey on my back at bay.  

But trust and believe if oxy fell into my lap it would go right into my mouth.  ",1550274907.0

Not sure if everyone does their deed the same way, so quick rundown of how I roll:

After getting the sweet nectar of the gods inside my rig, I poke it through my skin just barely to where the hole/opening is entirely in my skin. At this point I pull back slightly on the plunger, which is where my question comes in! When I pull back while in my skin, but not yet in the vein, it looks like just air. But as soon as I push the needle in a tad more and hit the vein, the blood that rushes in fills and displaces the empty space that I made by pulling back before registration.

So what the heck actually is that ‚Äúnothing‚Äù space? It doesn‚Äôt seem like normal air because the blood fills up the newfound available space, which when you have a normal air bubble it doesn‚Äôt do this. Is this truly the first time I have seen, or at least realized that I am looking at what is truly nothing? Not oxygen or air or any sort of invisible gas? Have I found the void?

This might be a dumb question but it‚Äôs eating away at me that I don‚Äôt know the answer",1550260106.0

Hope all of you are fine and not sick and dont have to hustle all day. So today was a good day. It was the first day I am allowed to drive again(Had a psychotic schock in one of my maniac phases and wasnt allowed to drive a car for 7 days) so I went out and grabbed my 3 packages I ordered. 2 0.5g samples, one was ok, I first did a small teat bump and felt notging after 10 min so I did the whole .5 and felt a little bit high. Wasnt that good stuff, was cut to the end. Tge other one was a big rock, brown with black/brownish spots, that normally means its directly cut off the brick and man I can tell for sure that shit was directly of the brick, maybe cut once by the dudes who make the bricks. Broke off about .2 and cut it down into two small lines. And hell yes that .2 made me nod for a hour straight. Great stuff. Also very cheap cauae I live near one of the biggest drug smuggling ports. After I came back I had my doctor appointment and since I had my psychotic meltdown in my maniac comedown phase I needed to get a script from him to see a psychatrist. I also told him that the emergency psychatric I saw wasnt allowed to write acripts(he really isnt allowed to) so I said to my doctor that the emergency psychatrist gave me Tavor 2.5mg expidet (Lorazepam 2.5mg) and that I didnt got any left and that the otger doc said that my primary doctor should write me a script for them untill I can see a psychatrist. Which is next week. I told him that I got the appointment 2 weeks later and he wrote me a N3 script for Tavor 2.5mg expidet (N3 acript means 5 blisters which 10 pills per blister) so 50 2.5mg Lorazepam for me. As usual with my primary doc he only gives me them on a private script not on a insurance Script cause I went to detox once and the insurance dont likes seeing benzos written out then. Ao I had to pay 20‚Ç¨ instead of 5‚Ç¨. But who cares. Now I got 20mg diaz left, about 25-30mg Xanax(Unfortunately they are broken so I am not sure completly how much they are) plus the .3 brick and 5g of some fire dope I also received. And next week I will trick the psychatrist in writting me a benzo script too. I just dont tell him about my addiction. That was a good day. How was your day guys? Hopefully as successfull as mine?

For the most part my dealers always have the same exact 2-4 stamps every time I see them so I know ahead of time what I'm getting. They're all the same quality.

I couldn't get in touch with my regular guys today but I got the number of a new guy on the same block who sells the same shit last time. He called me back shortly after he asked if I could see him at 2pm this afternoon. Obviously I told him not as it was only 9am at the time.  He told me  his boy would take care of me that lives right around the corner!!

Finally I'm in luck.  I've been out here since 745 am waiting for someone to pick their phone up or for me to catch someone outside. So the first question I ask this kid is ""what stamp is it?"" He comes back to me saying it's ""paid in full"". Perfect this is one of the regular stamps I get all the time that I enjoy. He sends me address and I walk right around the corner letting him know to tell his boy I want a full brick ( 5 buns).

Perfect he let's me know we are Good to go and to meet his buddy at the end of the block. I walk down call him ""I'm here"" and as I hang up his boy is walking towards me. First thing I do is ask him if it's ""paid in full"" like I was told and the guy tells me no. Tells me he has magic Johnson which I've had in the passed and it's alright but I know the value and  fent. This guy tells me that his friend told him to give me those when he called him. No thanks. Told this guy I'm good and didn't spend a dime. Honestly if the guy told me he had magic Johnson straight up I would have got them. I immediately called the guy back and told him I didn't take it. I told him if that ever happens again and they tell me one stamp but it's a different one that I'll never hit him up again. I told him if him or his boy was just honest from the start I would have taken it anyway. Now this guy's out a brick sale and as I'm typing this up my main connection just texted me saying he's awake and I can come through. Perfect. The point of this post was to talk about how I can't fucking stand if someone lies about the stamp they have.  I'll spend my money on what I want and I don't let anyone jerk me around period. I ended up picking up a bundle from a different connection in the same town while I waited.  Now I'll go get what I really want. Thanks for letting me vent. What do you guys do if someone tries to give  you different product? Do you take it and hope for the best? I'm strictly against that.

Well if you‚Äôve shot coke you know there‚Äôs a ton of shots and lots of blood from registering and reregistering to avoid missed shots because coke hurts like a motherfucker fr. But anyway I clogged all my normal 30g syringe and all I had left is 22g 3CC 1.5‚Äù syringes I used for steroids. With no way to get new rigs until the exchange opens in a few days I just had to use those. 

Now holy fuck those bitches are massive. My arms are fucked rn with massive marks and bruises from all the shooting up which sucks and it‚Äôs become a huge ordeal to have to do it because the needle is so big I can‚Äôt hit a lot of veins so I need to like find large ones or dig around a bit which is what I‚Äôve been doing and that shit sucks fr.

Not by choice.,"So I've got a big problems with my legs, even had to get both of my hips replaced before I was 19. I couldn't ever get a doctor to give anything stronger than tramadol or 5mg/325 hydros. (I am accepting advise on ways to convince a doctor to help with stronger stuff lol) So I always had friends who'd help me find oxys (Instant releases only those help. The time release or OP or whatever they are called don't do anything for me) cause those really worked. Well about 5 months ago it took like 3 20mg Oxys before I even felt pain relief. In between getting pills I took kratom for my pain and it took a lot of kratom to help me. Then all the connects dried up and Kratom is all I had. It helped me through withdrawals, it helped with pain and everything.

 Well come yesterday and my GF is saying she got me something special. She got 8 10mg oxy and 4 10mg hydros, not much but I was happy with anything I got at this point. (Just to let you guys know I snort my oxy and swallow hydros. Just my choice of delivery.) So I got home and did 2 of the 10mg Oxy. My legs felt incredible no pain then about 5 minutes later I'm on the best high since the first time I did these things. It was fantastic. FYI I don't necessarily try to use these to get high but IF it happens well its a bonus but I don't actively chase a high. 

All in all, I know its not really a doctors fault that they can't help me its cause they are scared and they don't wanna lose their license or anything. I don't really believe in ""cool doctors"". I'm also not mad or holding any grudges against the doctors I saw that could only give me tramadol and 5mg hydros. They tried and wanted to help, I just wanna make that clear. Another thing I wanted to mention was if any of you wanna get off opiates and are skeptical about Kratom it does work. just read up on knowing how to dose it or else you'll be puking everywhere unless you already are from the taste. Because of my tolerance I use to take almost 12g of kratom per dose but now I only take like 5g or less. (I doss kratom by mixing it with 8oz of water. Seriously I'm shocked with how low my tolerance for only 5 months but I guess that kinda is a long time. Figured I'd share my story of an amazing Valentines!

What was in the baggie was an off-white, gritty powder, and a part of me is worried that it could be heroin. He lied to me about using pills for over a year, so it‚Äôs definitely possible that he‚Äôs lying and hiding this from me too.

However, when I hear about the OC80 days, the prices people mention seem near impossible for Heroin to beat, especially since fentalogues werent a factor yet.

Would it be easy/worth it to 'fake' a heroin/pill addiction to get a Suboxone prescription? Or is there something preventing non 'true' addicts from getting it?,"I live in Australia, and vasically for the past few months I've been using opioids spaced very far apart with consistency in minimum times between. Been using Dihydrocodeine, Morphine pills, Codeine Pills (30mg prescriptions ones and a couple boxes of 12.8mg Codeine/200mg Ibuprofen's left over from when they were OTC), as well as occasional Oxycodone from friends' prescriptions and a few Suboxone bought over the DNM. 

Basically, would it be possible or worth it for someone like myself (18M, no current or former record of addiction) to say purchase a smaller amount of Oxy and/or Heroin off the DNM's, use lightly for a week or two or there abouts (orally dosed, lower than recreational) and go in claiming I've been addicted to heroin and/or Pain Pills for a couple months and want to get Suboxone for either help with withdrawals or strongly preferably as a maintenance.

What checks do they do to confirm you as an addict? Would they do a blood test for Diamorphine/Morphine or Oxycodone/other opioids? Or would I need to be physically dependent, and have to demonstrate to them that I am going through withdrawals? Would I have to do regular drug tests (I currently use Cannabis and Benzos without a prescription, I would not take any other opioids if I got Suboxone), and would I have to be clean off other illegal drugs to be on Suboxone, or do they not do that here (Australia)? I have a prescription of Dexamphetamine from a psychiatrist for diagnosed ADHD, would I be able to get a Suboxone prescription without him being notified (since he also sees my parents so they can't know if I had a Suboxone prescription), or would they be required to let him know about it? 

I would not intent to take the Suboxone on a daily basis as I am not yet dependent and have never been and don't plan on becoming dependent (unless it'd be completely necessary to get a short dependency on 5mg oxy if it would mean I could get Suboxone for 'maintenence') and would probably just use it recreationally at the same frequency as my current opioid use (1-2x per month) to eliminate costs of buying my current opioids, and sell some of the rest/keep a stash for later use.

So, with all this considered, would it be worth it here in Australia to do what it takes to fake having a dependency/addiction to Oxy/Heroin in order to get a maintenance script for 'preventing withdrawals and cravings'. Or would the effort required to get a full maintenance script (not a taper/withdrawal script) be too much to not bother in trying?

While sweeping i saw a pill under one of the register counters. As someone who typically finds floor pills, i expected to be a tylenol or a perc or somthing of that nature.

When i got a closer look i found that its a completely blank white capsule.

Took it to the bathroom and cracked it open and its full ofa light brown powder. It seems like a ""0"" capsule.

Powder smells strange. Not great, almost bitter and earthy.

I only do roxis on the weekends, is this dope? Is there a way to tell? I know dope comes in caps where i live. 

Heres a pic as well. Let me know if theres any tests (without buying anything) i can do to check. Thanks fellas.

So this would actually be my first post here but I‚Äôve been reading others posts on addiction and I believe I‚Äôve just been ignoring that fact. I have been taking oxy 15-45mg since April 2018 . It started small , I had a surgery and began with 5 mg but then my doctor cut me off and dropped me to tramadol. After pleading with him about how that was bringing me no relief I felt like I had full access to buy street drugs so that‚Äôs what I did. I was not an addict at that time so I was buying 15mgs for $16 and taking only half. This lasted until October and I started to take the whole thing ... but imagine how much money I was spending at this point & still out of work from complications of my surgery. 
By October I was becoming depressed because I‚Äôm not the type to not work. I wanted to work. The pain I was in was just not allowing it and my doctor even had me on disability but was still unwilling to give me a pain medication that worked . At this point he gave me muscle relaxers, diclofenac ,& gabapentin. The diclofenac was no good for pain either.. however the muscle relaxers gave me some minor relief. Being depressed and still in a lot of pain I was taking the full 15 mgs & began to even go back to work in November because I felt if I could buy a few oxy to maintain my pain, I could work & did. I love my job . I‚Äôm one of the best with the clients actually. However, With my job I‚Äôm on my feet a lot , so maybe I began to get a tolerance at this time, but I was still suffering with pain so I began taking 20mgs and that became 30mg and now 45mgs. To this day I‚Äôm still in horrible pain if I don‚Äôt take the oxys, but I also know I‚Äôve become an addict . I‚Äôve even tried to stop for the sake of my health and force myself to deal with the pain but, without it I can‚Äôt think straight... my body sweats while I‚Äôm freezing ... I can‚Äôt sleep ...I have no will to do anything other that the bare minimum of what I have to do. Im still depressed and I believe I‚Äôm also medicating the depression because with the oxys.... I feel NOTHING . Not even the emotional pains of the real world& I love that feeling. I blame no one but myself.. but I wish my doctor had really listened to my cry for help and maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have looked elsewhere for relief. ",1550197530.0

It seems like the majority of people on here and in real life always think that when they get street drugs with ""fent"" that its the same fentanyl that comes in fentanyl patches, but its not. The fent in dope and pressed pills is any of the 20-30 common fentanyl analogues. Each different fent analogue is its own opioid and the name ""fent"" has nothing to do with how long it lasts, how strong it is, or how good it feels.

You cannot shoot your dope and tell if its fent or not by how it feels. The only way to tell is by testing it. Some fentanyl analogues feel just as good as heroin. Some such as carfentanil last twice as long as heroin. And just cause its a fentalogue doesnt mean its automatically gotta be 10,000x stronger than heroin. Some are very similar in strength or even weaker than heroin. Heroin is pretty much a thing of the past for ecp dope at least. If you're on the east half of the united states and you get ecp, then youve already been getting fentalogues for the past 3-4 years. You might think its heroin still but its probably not

Just off the top of my head without researching them i know theres carfentanil, sufentanil, acetylfentanyl, butyrfentanyl, acrylfentanyl,etc etc etc.  Each is different than the rest. Saying all fentanyl analogues are the same is almost like saying all opioids are the same.

It really doesnt matter if the dope/pill has fent in it. The only thing that matters is if the kind of fent is a good kind and feels good cause most arent gonna last only 30-60 min like fent patch fentanyl.

Its pretty much the same thing as when they kept making new kinds of k2/spice/synthetic cannabinoids years ago. The current spice would get made illegal and then they would tweak the molecules and make a new kind of spice.  Pretty much the same exact thing has been happening with the fent analogues these past few years. Its all just research chemicals made in labs in china then mailed to the united states. About 8 years ago my friend couldnt smoke weed at the time so hed order a tub of pure spice powder and a huge bag of some fluffy plant material to smoke the powder. Hed mix up the spice powder in water in a spray bottle then spray the spongey plant and make his own k2. Nowadays these guys order 10-20-50-etc grams of r.c fentalogues and cut it to make street level dope. They're getting the fentalogues cheap as fuck and making a killing selling it cheaper than real heroin used to be. 

Its possible that theres plain fentanyl out there, just like its possible to get pressed xanax with alprazolam in it or oxy 30s made with illicit oxycodone, but 99.9% of the time its just gonna be a similar drug that feels like the real thing.",1550196954.0

I obv never say anything about -it-, but I get the sense they can tell somethings off and they usually cancel a second date.  I dont think being 5'6 has helped, but not blaming it, clearly I'm doing something wrong but still trying to figure out what that is.  I fear its a vicious cycle where I use to make being alone more bearable, but that only makes me be more alone.  I know this isn't rocket science and anyone could have told me this is what would happen but sometimes I just feel really lost.

it‚Äòs literally 7-10 times as strong as street #3 (only form you can get where i am, sonewhere in  europe) and easily 2-3 times as strong as other gear from these dark places i‚Äòve had. 

i‚Äòm on 35mg levo-methadone a day (twice as strong as methadone, incase someone doesn‚Äòt know) and can drink two ratios at once and barely get high (no nodding), which is fucked and really scares me tbh. with this fucking fire #4 i can take one small ~20mg line and i‚Äòm good, another 10-20mg and i‚Äòm nodding, it‚Äôs that strong. it definitely has no fent in it i can tell.

to my question: although i know it‚Äôs somewhat considered a waste, but is there a way to make #4 smokable? never had a rush from smoking because everytime i did it, my tolerance would be too high already before getting into dope, i never banged it either, and this is the only gear that may be strong enough (but usually not smokable.
