Now I made sure to space out my bags on purpose obviously to make sure I'd have like two bags for later on the evening (9-10pm) so I can do a bag & a half an hour or so before I go to bed as I knew I have to work in the morning (today). 

Sooooo normally when I space it out like this which I always do, even when I usually would only get like 3 bags a day of similar dope, I would do some like 10pm to make fucking SURE that I would wake up at 7 am not sick at all-- maybe have big ass pupils at the most and perhaps watery bitcheyes.

Turns out maybe since I've been redosing more often past few weeks it appears that I get sicker quicker!

I talked to my dboy about the quality and he said it honestly is higher quality and more expensive than what he's had-- and he actually pays more for it-- I verified this by asking a couple of his customers that I linked them up w him to see what they think about the recent quality and they say they love it it's got the full fledged warmth and everything and they've been paying $50 a half bun where as I pay $40 a half bun because my dboy knows I don't play that pay more for this stamp shit I pay the same fucking price for any dope I get from him doesn't matter if it's better or worse. 

I got lucky because I got only $27 total from working since my boss didn't have cash on hand today and guess what? My dboys cousin who gets the bricks shipped to him actually ripped open a fresh brick in front of me and slung me two free bags for ""being a consistent customer and trustworthy dude"". So ducking happy y'all don't even know this is probably the first time junkie Jesus has ever visited me in my entire 4+ years being in the dope game. Man I'm relieved.

And I gotta say going from -5 to 10 (sick as a dying ballsack to Feeling AAAAA10000000) is so ducking awesome I cant even express!!!! Woooooosh fuckin awesome guys I really truly hope (& im not just saying this bc I'm lit) that every single one of you who needs dope today gets well and is able to actually enjoy their day!

Welp, I'm gonna actually lay down for a little and hopefully get some ""sleep"" because I have only been getting maybe 3 hours in at most every night now due to stress and bad ass anxiety since I'm still having ""withdrawals"" from when I was taking 20+mg of xanax daily for a very long time and went cold turkey because I haven't had the money to order my 500packs of xanax bars any more; that is until I start this new job and have a steady income again! 🤑

Sure. It's hard for me to say no to her.

So instead of getting high, I start rationing just so I don't get sick. 

Nope.

Picture me on a fancy date with my girlfriend, while I'm getting dumped by my other girlfriend. She looks beautiful but it's hard to notice. Shivering, yawning at the table. Desperately trying to just make it through dinner. Eyes pouring and I can't even touch the food.

Somehow it ends. It ends! 

Blurt out some BS excuse quickly... Doesn't matter what. She nods. I drop her off at home and speed out the gates of my beautiful home that people like me don't deserve.

You know how this story ends- a kind guy standing outside a donut shop 40 minutes away. He gets in and I hand him the money. There's a moment where we lost a $20, then found it, cheap relief.

I stare at the rear view mirror, watch him walk away with my money. He left his house keys with me, a gesture to be sure, but paranoia is in high gear.

Mostly I just want to be part of a book club and the book club at the library picks terrible books for the most part. And it seems like y'all pick some winners, so figured this could be a fun idea?

Fine. I don't like going without getting confirmation of IN HAND drugs first but fuck it I'm desperate. 

Me and my bud go there and of course, they're all gone. **fucking** jizz gargling, anal polyp fucked me again.

So I get ahold of someone 1.5 hours away whom is *good*. In-hand verified. **Finally**! I have an errand to run first so I go to where I work to sort something out and as I'm walking to my car to drive 1.5 hours a car drives up. I can't see who's in it but they don't seem to be looking at me.

I start getting in the car and he beeps like hell at me...it's the uncle of a dude I used to get pills from before he went ""*away*"".

""*Hey boss, you needing anything?*""

""*What do you have? Are you talking weed or what?*""

""*Uhm, Roxy 30's, I think there are some Perc 10's also...oh some oxy 15's too.*""

*--Commence Undergarment Soilage--*

Long story short (too late), he drives me 2 mins away walks me into some dudes place and shows me an Asian buffet of pills - **cheap**!.

15's for $10, 30's for 20, perc 10's for $5 approximately.

I stocked the fuck up and drove the whole 4 mins to my house with a grin glued to my fucking fat face.

That was amazing. A perfect aligning of the stars - a perfect storm of coincidence and timing....*kismet*.

I hope **all** of my /opiates fam can have days like I just had.

**update** - I can't believe I failed to mention this the first time but he says he keeps the 40mg opana in stock as a rule and should have them today for $50. I have *no* clue if that's a good price.

the first dude i came across seemed legit on text and we agreed to meet up. he lived approximately an hour and half away from so i drove all the way over to his place. when i was within minutes upon arrival, he dropped on me because there was ""cops"" in the area. i was pissed off and i told him i would wait out, and he finally texted me back like 30 mins later: ""i don't have roxie's on me anymore, you like subs?"" and i got screwed over, goddamnit i was not happy.

however, this did not end my craigslist roxy cinderella hunt - i went back home and looked up on craigslist once again. this time i found a dude, who was absolutely polite and nice on text and we agreed to meet up today. we met up, i hopped over in his car n did the deal in a minute and scored myself 6 roxie's and found myself a new connect! the pills look legit and am gonna do a test line soon to ensure it's not fent, then i'll be off to the euphoric wonderland this evening!

craigslist is legit - BUT BE CAREFUL! be sure to filter out the posts and use your judgement. there are plenty of useful tips in this subreddit and comments (specificially u/dori_88 's comment) on my previous post.

6ccaqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ccaqz/newb_question_are_opiates_better_when_dopesick/,41,https://redd.it/6ccaqz,PhillyBroCo,Newb question: Are opiates better when dopesick?,"I have seen a couple posts and comments which say something along the lines of ""I wanted to save the shot until I was dopesick"" or ""I didn't want to waste my dopesickness just getting well, I wanted to do enough to also get high"".

So my question: is it better to do opiates when dopesick? If so, why? Does it get you higher, is your tolerance lower, does it potentiate, is it the relief from eliminating the sickness, etc.

Edit: Original Post Above, New Edit Below

I honestly didn't think this was as stupid a comment as the general response seems to indicate. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, but either way I'm going to try to explain it better below for the sake of clarity. 

So the first part of the question may have been obvious, if you are feeling dopesick and then take enough dope to get high, the relative jump to being high from being sick is greater than the jump to being high from feeling normal.

That may have been obvious to everyone. And I think asking if it is 'better' is pretty stupid on my part because it is nebulous. Is it worthwhile to let yourself get sick so that you have a relatively larger jump in physical/mental state? Or is it better to not let yourself get sick in the first place and have a smaller jump, but not be uncomfortable to begin with? 

It's all up to personal preference, but I was interested in hearing other people's opinion. But I can see why people thought it was stupid.

Now the second part, having established that it feels better to do a relatively larger jump than a smaller jump, what are the reasons for the jump? Obviously there is a psychological component, but maybe there are physical factors as well such as tolerance. 

And finally, is the relative jump of dopesick usage chemical as well as psychological? To put it simply, do you release more dopamine or whatever other chemicals involved if you use while dopesick, or is just psychological comfort? Is it even possible to separate the psychological component from the chemical component, it might be that the psychological comfort is caused by a superior dopamine rush. I really have no idea. I can speculate, but I was interested in what other people, layperson and science enthusiast alike, had to say.

So far I've tried kratom, codeine, tramadol and tilidin. They were nice, yes, but it does not come close to the descriptions I read online. I wonder if morphine or oxy for example would be sooo much better, since tilidin(most of you most likely never tried it) has 1/5 of the analgetic properties of morphine. 

I know that the risks of opiates are how they are because people are often underwhelmed, therefore letting their guard down. Anyways, I'm getting off topic. Just curious if oxy or hydrocodone or whatever will give me the feeling of how I expected it to be, as I don't see that much of an dependence potential for the substances I listed so far, at least not for me personally.

Im sure many of you will say I just have really bad technique, perhaps I do, for example I go rooting around with the needle sometimes instead of just pulling out and trying again, but still  i would never have guessed i would lose them so fast given that many older junkies still have veins and these people are not using good iv technique either.

Like the time I was lead blindfolded into the bathroom of a trap house after midnight in nap town.
It was around midnight and I was starting to get sick.  I had already resigned myself to a sleepless night of cold sweats and restless legs when my phone rang.  It was the plug.

“Yo mayne, get yoself over to da spot. Bring yo works witchu.”

“Alright bet, I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”

Shit, he didn’t have to ask me twice. I had just moved to the city from a small town about an hour away, so I was able to convince the guy who used to score for me to introduce me to the plug; and living closer to the plug than most of his customers, which were almost exclusively white kids from the country or the suburbs, had its perks.  He had mentioned he might hit me up to try a new batch for him, but I never expected him to actually follow through with it.  I had my shoes on and was out the door in ten seconds flat.  

I had only been to this particular spot during daylight hours.  It was this ghetto fucking apartment complex across from a wal-mart.  The place was at the very back of the complex which were these single story shithole apartments on either side of a pot-hole strewn road.  One way in, one way out… a trap in every sense of the word.  I remember thinking in the back of my head, “what the fuck are you doing? This is a bad idea.” But the sickness was in control and pushed those thoughts back in favor of getting well.  Fuck it, I know this dude.  I see him damn near every day, he has no reason to rob me or beat me down. I pulled up and called him to let him know I was there.  I pocketed my spoon and rig and got out of the car, waiting for him to come out. After a few minutes I hear a door open and some guy I’d never seen before came over to me.

“Yo, you freddy?”

“Yeah man, MC told me to come out here.”

“Yeah, you gonna try out some new shit for us.”

“Fine by me. I’ll just go to that Walmart over there and try it out.”

“Nah man, you gotta come inside. Come on, follow me.”

Alarm bells starting ringing in my head, but fuck it, I’ve already come this far.  No way I’m going back home empty handed.  I followed him to the apartment door, but before he opened the door he took his jacket off and told me to put it over my head so I couldn’t see anything.  I did as instructed, and was lead inside.  The second I stepped in a cloud of weed smoke hit me head on, dank as fuck.  I said something stupid like, “damn, smells good in here fellas,” while the dude lead me across the room and into a hallway.  He opened a bathroom door and took the jacket off my head and handed me two small rocks before closing the door behind him.
I cooked up my shot and blasted off.  Knocked on the bathroom door when I was done and got lead back out to my car.

“So watchu think mayne?”

“It’s good man.  Not any better than the regular shit, but certainly not any worse.”

“Alright alright, that’s what’s up. Come through tomorrow, I’ll hook you up fat.”

“Hell yeah man, I appreciate it. If you ever need a tester, you know where to find me.”

And that is why it’s not always a bad thing for a white guy to be lead blindfolded into a trap house full of drug dealers in the ghetto.

Wish me luck please and pray for me. I'm done for a very long time,"I hope to give up opiates for at least 1 year and at the super least 6 months.

I have been on and off for 6 years but not addicted. Rare usage and then would stop for years because I didn't have access nor was an addict.

Since last March I went hardcore as in once in a while. But since August it's been non stop with only two 3 week long breaks.

Opiates at first brought so much joy and I'd only need 30mg hydro for an amazing 7 hourhigh .

But then got a girlfriend and stress went up. Started oxycodone use and then eventually started snorting. Now I snort. Told my self the past week that I've been buying oxy that it's my last day but keep buying it. Not to mention I mix it with cocaine.

I've realized that all this opiate use had made my inner self just depressed and darker. Opiates feel good only when you seek them, buy them, have new ones in your hands, and break it down and finally snort, and the initial high. But overall, they make you feel good but rob you of your natural feel good chemicals which are far superior.

3 week break I did some low dose Naltrexone to reset my endorphins and ran a lot to boost my endorphins and everything felt naturally good. I and really energy. Endorphins are released when you work for it so I basically always had to accomplish a task to feel good.

Opiates just waste my money and time, cause me to get irritated at my girl and caused a huge fight which I called her terrible names, there are many times where she is ok if I cum on her face but I can't bust for 1 hour jerking off and it's ridiculous, plus it makes me depressed while I feel good on it.

I think it's time for me to permanently stop. I wanna put my faith in God and place my bets of feeling good through accomplishment.

Opiates used to be something I would acquire at the right time through someone who just happened to have it right when I needed it, and only around 40 pills max of 10mg hydros which I'd do twice a week 3-4 pills max. My favorite reason for hydros in the past year was going to the airport looking fresh ready to take off and taking 3 pills with red bull just before the flight which would make the experience blissful. Then I'd land in Dubai and take 10 mg every hour of hydro in my uncles lamborghini while id drive it crazy the whole day.

When I came back to Cali I kept taking hydros once a week to relive that feeling. Then I met my girl and stressful situations made me abuse it and switch to oxy and snorting. I even did IV MORPHINE once but it was an ampoule.

Now I realize I'm done. Lately the past month it's been always a mix of oxy and cocaine. It's justrridiculous. Cocaine is even worse for the mind and depression than just plain opiates.

Guys and gals. Sorry for the long story. But wish me luck and blessings. I know I'll probably fly somewhere soon, but I'll just drink red bull by itself. No taking opiates which has always been my favorite. Always felt like a dream to know I have hydros on me at the airport, but even this, I need to give up because this thought keeps making me do opiates even when I'm not travelling.

Hope I can make it. I don't even think I'll suffer through withdrawals this time around. Only started again last Friday and did my last oxy 30 3 hours ago. But I know I'll have 2 days of tiredness and then I'll reduce caffeine and in 7 days will do naltrexone.

Hope to make it and start taking over my life ",1495446621.0

I came across some green 15s from a guy I've done a lot of business with and has always told me if his pills were real or fake. These were E7s and I've never seen them before. They were legit looking though. He also swore they were real, so I believed him and broke 3 down and put them up my nose. I instantly knew something was up because of how high I was. When I got in my car I kept getting higher, so I told him they are definitely pressed. he insisted he didn't know and said not to drive away yet he'll go grab me a water. Well When he got out of my car I blacked out for idk how long, but I came to to him pounding on my chest like 20 minutes later. 

I'm glad I only did about half of my regular dose otherwise I am pretty sure I would have died right there. Also, I'm thankful I didn't drive away in my new car and kill someone. 

I know for a fact that Bizzie is still selling these as oxy 15s, so be careful if you get your hands on them. The press is pretty high quality honestly, so be careful fam. I'm not even sure if it was fent or that U shit or something else because it felt super weird. ",1495435531.0

I know everyone gets different size bags of different potency and amounts of cut where they are, so I wanna see how strong your guy's stuff is.

This generally is only geared towards ECP users. What would you say the average blue (30mg oxy) to bag ratio is for the stuff you get? I recently just got into dope. Also, please put your ROA for each drug. 

I've seen alot of people say that one bag of dope is equal to one blue. Going forward with this logic got me super fucked up. Of course I test bumped but didn't feel much. When I felt confident in what I was using, I went for the whole bag and railed it in two lines. This was some nice looking tan stuff. I'd say the bag was equal to about 1.5 blues. Each bag I get weighs 60mg as I get them from a guy who buys weight and bags them himself. He also doesn't add any cut to his dope, and his source allegedly does not either as the source gets it from a connect directly working getting it from Columbia. 

Next time around, my friend had some grey shit. Like not just an off-white, this shit was literally fucking grey like gravel. Again did my usual two or three match-head sized test bumps (and had my experienced friend watching with narcan ready). This time I actually caught a bit of a buzz from the test bumps. Then I went ahead and railed the grey bag. This bag was a solid 2 blues worth of dope. I was fucking dumfounded at how $10 worth of dope compares to 2 blues which can run me anywhere from $40-60.

And before anyone asks, the bags are not (noticeably) fent cut. My friend, and the supplier of the bags, is very experienced. He can easily do bundle shots of this fire dope. He's also IV'd, smoked, and orally taken fent both intentionally and as a cut, and said he can tell me 100% that none of the dope he's ever bought or sold me has had a spec of fent in it from his experience.",1495433648.0

The Critical Juncture.,"I hadn't used H for over 3 years and even then I was on subs and would chip on weekends or a few times a month then hop back on subs. I got off subs coming up on 9 months ago which I found pretty difficult. not the sickness really but the length of time and I never really felt good. I guess I wasn't doing what I should have been, like exercising and working a program and what not.

Anyway when I stopped subs, one of the things that I did to get my mind off it and what not was jerk off. Months later I was jerking off everyday most of the time and thinking, I don't like being a person that jerks off all the time. So I stopped doing that. It must have been feeding the addiction demon to a degree because once I stopped I started craving my old pal h and started thinking about that obsessively. I had spent two weeks planning for a little binge session to commence the first week of June when I have a 1 week vacation from work. Part of that including reaching out to some old pals from the old neighborhood just to make sure i can get all the supplies for my vacation. I wanted coke and dope and syringes basically. So I found a buddy who still does it. 

Anyway Thursday rolls around and he asks if I want to do some and I go ahead and don't wait for my vacation. I know I have to be careful because of fent in the ECP and my tolerance is very low. I decided to be conservative and got 20 bucks of coke and 5 bags of dope. The coke was gone that night and when I tested the dope, very very little got me super fucked up so I only wound up doing like a bag and a half. On Friday I had kind of a hangover type feeling so I did a tiny fraction probably less than a quarter of the bag just to feel a bit better and take care of business. Sat I didn't do anything and Sunday night (tonight) I didn't do anything except another quarter of a bag maybe less because theres still like 1 or 2 shots left in the second bag.

So all in all I haven't done very much in total, but whats kind of scaring me is the fact that I've done it 3/4 days and the rate I'm going I will do little amounts until its gone which would be like a week from now or something. 

Am I setting myself up to catch a habit? Do any successful chippers have any advice. Should I save the rest for the weekend? I didn't like the feeling of being too messed up like puking and nauseous. I like doing a shot and feeling good to relax but I wonder how shitty I am going to be at work tomorrow. I don't want my job performance to suffer but I don't want that to be an excuse to use everyday like a moron and catch a habit again after all these years then I will just lose everything. My previous chipping experience was with not taking my subs for a day then binging out then hopping back on the subs the next day. I already had an opiate habit so I was just substituting.",1495421043.0
6ckkpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ckkpf/so_i_heard_you_like_stories/,65,https://redd.it/6ckkpf,VoidDwellerZ,So I heard you like stories..,"It's about 10:30pm on a California summer night.  I get a call from my boy A, ""hey I just met this girl, can you drop off a eighth of bud?"" He says excitedly

""As long as its not another front, Where you at?"" I reply

""Nah shes paying, Safeway parking lot"" he sounds annoyed that I'm reminding him that he owes me quite a bit of money.

Lets back up a bit.  I've known A since the tender age of 7. We always got each other into trouble.  

We've been running the streets and raising hell together since the first year of high school.  

We've both been strung out on H for a few years at this point. 
We look out for each other, I roll him onto his side when he gets alcohol poisoning, stay up to make sure he's breathing throughout the night.   

He brings over the bottle and the dope when I go through one of my suicidal depressed phases.  He sends all his stoner friends my way, we try to keep each other well and alive.

He's about 6'1"" blond hair, blue eyes with a nice frame that's grown skinny from dope, even though hes been through hell hes still a kid at heart, sweet, trusting and innocent in a lot of ways.  

I'm a small guy, not intimidating at all (5'6"")  yet I still am the one who steps in when something needs to be handled. 
He'd rather let our money walk than fight, which probably makes him a better person than I am.  

Back to the story. 

I drive there and park, they hop into the car.  After introductions we make the exchange.   

Shes attractive and knows it, pretty smile that looks practiced, a bit sucked up from stims.  

We go get some food and talk for a bit, A is making puppy dog eyes at her the whole time.   She keeps smiling at me and brushing my shoulder as she shows some of her photography on her camera and phone. 

I can feel A glaring daggers by this point.   He doesn't realize shes just trying to play us off each other.  I like her, she reminds me of some of the girls I drive to work.  

One of the photos she shows me is the rigs shes been using.  Three rigs with all the numbers worn off next to a matchbook..  
It being exchange day I have 3 boxes of 200 rigs each plus all the other supplies sitting at home.  
""throw those out now"" I say ""were going to my place, I'll hook you up""  

I can tell A is pissed by this, (don't know why, he has a much better chance to get with her on my couch.  His other option is sneaking her though his bedroom window at his parents house).

She mentions on the way that she just moved back from the East Bay and doesn't know anyone in the area..  We stop on the way for some BTH, crystal, and booze.  We all pitch in but she and I put in most of the cash. 

So once we get home everything is good, I give her all the essentials plus a box of 200 new rigs.  We get loaded as fuck on tar.  Smoke bowl after bowl, some weed, some crystal. and have those deep yet meaningless conversations you can only have while spun and drunk.   
When she goes to the bathroom A turns to me and asks ""so what do you think?!""  His eyes bright and a shit eating grin on his face.

Because I care about him, I spit nothing but truth.  ""I like her, she'd make a great using buddy, but she'll rip your heart out if you let her"" 

I see his face fall and his lip raise in anger.. Not the answer he wanted.  We argue for a bit in hushed tones. 

When she gets back he proceeds to drink and shoot tar 'till he's nodding at 1am (nights still young homie).  Even though she and I aren't even entertaining the idea of sleep yet I go to my room and turn out the lights as they cuddle up on my couch.

20 min later I have my headphones on to drown out him snoring as I draw up a huge goofball. I feel the bed shift as she sits down next to me.  

She smiles at me and hold up her full rig, we toast, but with rigs.   After we shoot up she crawls in next to me.  

We just cuddle, I can tell she's down for/wants more.  I entertain the idea for a bit.  I haven't had a women this close to me since my fiancee left me.  But this is what my soul needs, somehow I feel its what she needs too.  

Plus I don't wanna do that to A.   
I kinda wish I had now..  She destroyed him without ever meaning to.


*6 years later*  maybe 7?  idfk anymore

*I've been clean for a while this is a different girl I encountered recently*

She has no idea what to make of me. 
her eyes linger as she glances at me.   I keep working as we talk.  She smiles shyly and walks with me as I carry a 60lb bag bag of feed over one shoulder.  

she's a nice girl from a upper middle class east coast family.  She moved to California to finish college.   Shes pretty in an unconventional way, sweet, highly intelligent, awkward, hopeful.  She's must be about the same age as I am, but she seems so young.  

How do they not sense it?   Behind the smile, the confident walk, the speech that alternates between rough and eloquent,  behind these blue eyes is a monster.   I'm toxic to anyone I let get close to me.   Ive destroyed nice girls like her before.   Not intentionally,  proximity is enough, like a black hole.  

4 years into recovery and I still don't trust myself, why do you?    Please don't smile at me like that..  I don't want to hurt anyone else.


Fuck, I don't know where I was going with these 2 stories.  They seemed linked and I wanted to get them out of my head.

Dropping off Dope.

	This will be a shortish one-ish…. I promise. Another get out of jail free card, on the part of a state boy….
	I had a buddy who hit me up while at work, wanted to know if I could bring a bun out…. So me and a girl/friend/buddy/etc. got in the whip and go to the spot…. This girl always hated when we drove fast… but I had a custie waiting…. On a backish road, we pass a tractor trailer, I keep it going. 110 is before slowing down….
	Turns out on the way up the next hill, a state trooper was doing a speed trap. Got me on radar at 94 in a 55. Ended up letting me go for “Failure to obey a traffic device” instead of the speeding ticket (1 mph under the speed you’d go to get arrested on the spot.He it’s what a speeding ticket could be reduced to, but no judge in his right mind would ever reduce one at that speed…. Then he wrote it to my dad on accident (Im a junior). The girl was pissed/terrified. He never searched us and let us go… I think I still got laid that night.

THE FUCKING CINNAMON INCIDENT

	This shit legitimately could’ve gotten me killed. Dealing with the roofie mc fuck brothers for like the 3rd or 4th time… Main dude was out, back up was on his way back from re upping and this fuck never wanted to tell me times distances… They didn’t want to wait. Knew a fucking bitch…. Becky. The boys wanted like 200 bucks worth… becky came through and these bags were hefty hefty hefty…. They went in mcd’s bathroom to shoot, (Wouldn’t do it in front of his wife)… I sat silently behind her in the car and started mixing my shot, sick af. As soon as the water hit it, I could smell the cinnamon. Every.Fucking.Bag. was cinnamon and sugar. As soon as I realized this, they came running up to the car. Furious. They almost stomped me out. I gave them her phone number, had to empty my pockets, etc. to show I wasn’t in on it. Ten minutes later back up dude came through and they spent another 200 or so. And were nice enough to still give me my one bag fee of course.

Another good story with them. We all were in one of those handicapped stalls at mcd’s… I shot myself first, but apparently the kitchen was on the otherside of the wall.

“Yo carmine shut the fuck up”

“Im just saying bro, this shit was fucking fire”

The door opens… those spiffy mcd’s crew leader black shoes.

“You guys can’t do that in here, you need to get the fuck out”

C stood there behind the closed door with the guy pounding on it now and MADE me stay and help hit a vein for him before we could leave.
When two huge roofers one with a Tyson face tat and my scrawny dope fiend ass walked out the guy looked like he had seen a ghot, and walked out pretty quick.

Those fucks were going to get me arrested.

Current

	Ugh, last night was awful… night before my birthday. Liquor store is closed Sunday. I don’t know if it was the tooth I just had pulled getting infected, or booze dt’s. try to fall asleep, starting to get the fucking shakes already… leg cramps, foot cramps. Can’t smoke cigs…. Time is dragging. Hot cold. Listen to music, boring documentaries. Message bords…. Everytime I fall asleep I think ive slept hours… its been 20 minutes. Sweating, shaking so bad I cant walk. Don’t feel like part of reality…. Looking up the definition of psychosis. Maybe. It’s 3. Only 5 more hours till I can get some beer.Sleep/shake/have leg cramps REALLY bad. Have to make my girl friend pull up onmy foot to get my calf muscle to stop locking into a painful ball of unmoveable fuckery. Considered drinking the vanilla (Some have 40% alcohol content) I don’t… now it’s 7. Fall asleep for an hour, wake up sweaty and shaking. Go in and look at the time. 7:10. Sleep another hour and go check… 7:23. Fuck. This is worse than any dope sick I’ve been. My heart is pounding. Deep breathing…. Get comfy. The last 10 mins are the worst (But aren’t they always. Happy motherfucking birthday! 8 oclock! Nasty beer instead of vodka, but it’ll get me right… My hands shake so much I can hardly pour the can or lift the pint glass. Can’t think.

J The Virgin!

	This fucking kid…. J was a lot younger, met him and big A at the gas station (Knew big a from my vike days, he used to sell em… ) They were sick af…. Introduced them to dope and J took a huge downward spiral… He basically would pick me up EVERY week when he got his pay check, we’d go to the check cashing spot, score, and he’d make me shoot him up. 
	Ended up going to rehab… He had stolen every piece of jewelry his mother had…. There was a spot that paid him for it. The day he got busted, his van was beat to shit, he stole his mother’s favorite real gold necklace, pawned it, then we went and got dilaudid…. We had done all but his last 2…. I was dying to mix up his shot for him so I could pretend to crush both and pocket one.…
	His phone rings, fuck, it’s his mom. I could hear her screaming… He throws me his last 16 mg of dillie and wants me to make his shot, saw my chance and took it… anyways, I got me another shot for myself, cops showed up after he got home.

Fucking.Barry.

	Met him, by dealing with aforementioned tweet… barry was an old man, kind of large, like 300 lbs. tweet was flaking out and not around, but I had met his “uncle” barry. Turns out, barry was his old teacher, was bi sexual, and they’d been fooling around since high school.
	I knock on barry’s door, he invites me in… says he likes me, thinks I’m a good guy. I explain, I’m sick, need something (I knew he had JUST refilled his oxy and vike 10’s…. He brings the bottles out and sets em on the table…
	
	“I’ve got a proposition for you… I don’t know if you know, but I’m bi-sexual. Now… I don’t want you to do anything to me…. But if you’d let me go down on you I’ll give you 10 pills and $50 dollars everytime….” Looks away kind of guiltily.

I don’t have time for this fucking shit. Sure, I guess a mouth is a mouth, but I am NOT into that….

“Well, I don’t know barry… Never thought about doing that, but look, I have 40 bucks, can I just by 8 of those oxy’s?”

“Only if you promise to think about it”

About to puke I’m so fucking sick.

“Alright deal.” 

Already had thought about it, no,

Fuck.

Anytime I tried to buy off of him in the future he’d ask if I’d thought of it…

6cj1vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6cj1vn/hi_all_again/,5,https://redd.it/6cj1vn,NarcAddict,"Hi all, again.","Well, it's been over 2 years since I posted here last, and I gotta say my life is both good and shit.

Most people here won't remember me but I used to post here a few years ago. 

Since then, many tnnhings have changed. I got off the dope, got hooked on free subutex. Ip uvThen went cold on that and hit the dope again on and off. Then subs again. WD. Clean, speed, Clean, dope, clean, drink, dope. Etc.  Always within my limit though. I am a father and would never take anything if I knew I was gonna be in charge of my son. I like my drugs, but my son comes first, and I don't care what anyone thinks. Yes, it can be hell when I am clean, but that smile on his face kills any pain. But, it's getting harder, and I don't know what the future holds. 

I grew up from the age of 4 in pubs with my mum. She drank a lot after my father left us. I never really knew him. Just some early memories of riding a motorbike down the river bank, me on the gas tank, my dad and one of his friends on the bike. That's about all I remember about him. 

From then my mum used to drink regularly, taking me with her to the pub each weekend. I basically grew up in pubs around people that knew how to have fun, have a fight, take drugs and enjoy life.

Then I married. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife and life. We both used to enjoy our lives. Ecstasy, amphetamines, coke etc. Then she fell pregnant. She stopped everything, and so did I.

9 years later, life is still good. But I have realised many things since then. I changed for her, but that made me someone I couldn't be. I cannot be without some substance in my system, that don t include cannabis as we both smoke that every night.

My wife seems content with life, but I am in constant pain. I'm living the life she wants, but I am slowly losing myself because of it. Some days it gets quite bad, I often visualise different ways I might die. I have always said, if I live till I am 50, I have done well, and I am 37 now. Lol. My father in law, my best friend, passed away 6 years ago on xmas. He was a big drinker, and drug taker. But he was a good, responsible man. It didn't change him. It allowed him to be the person he could, without the worries of how he looked, sounded etc. Fuck that shit. life is too short to worry about that shit. Live in the moment, as you could drop dead by tomorrow.

And that is what I am like. I live in the past, and the moment. I don't care, or worry about the future. We all die eventually, right?

So here I am. Yes, I have had a drink. 4 days ago I used dope again, followed by 1 day of amphetamines, and you know what. If felt good, for the first time in years, I felt alive.

And now I am questioning everything in life. Will I make it to 44 like my step father did. I swear to god I don t want to be alive long enough to be put in a home. But at the same time I want to be able to educate my son of the shit I have experience. Their ain't no drug he could come up with that I have not taken over the years, and I hope my experience can keep him alive long enough to enjoy his life. Drugs are rife in this area. I know he will take them, that's a given. But I need to educate him from experience, what it is like.

So, if I enjoy my life so much, why am I still losing control and giving in. My wife said I have a death wish and want to die young, but I always knew I wouldn't live a long life. I accepted this a long time ago. Every day I struggle with pretty bad thoughts that never end. 

Call it depression or whatever you like. 

This is 25+ years of enjoying life.

But with a cost I hope you will never experience, for it hurts.

I had this post up earlier, but it didn't feel right to post it so soon after what happened with roughneck. I didn't know him, but he seemed like a really great guy.    
    
I have decided to repost with a preface saying that if anyone is feeling low and wants someone to talk to, feel free to pm me. I'm a young person and new to this community and opiates in general, so there are plenty of people who can offer better advice than myself. But if you think that just talking with someone and sharing your story or hearing mine will give you some comfort and help deal with your personal struggle, then I will do the best I can to help.

&nbsp;

**Initial Post:**

My last post got called out for being stupid and obvious. I honestly didn't think it was that stupid and tried to clarify what I was asking, but it's hard to argue against the consensus :) . So I figured I might as well ask all my other stupid questions while I'm at it.

&nbsp;

*What are the different types of dope and their properties?*

&nbsp;

On here I see people talk about #3 and #4. I assume that there is also #2 and #1, but those are rarely mentioned. In addition to the numbering scheme, I hear people talk about the different colors as well, the main ones being black, brown, white, and grey.

So could someone help me figure out how these all fit together? I'll summarize what I have figured out so far below and hopefully you can correct me and fill in the gaps. Ideally I will put together enough information to be able to look up decent amounts of information about dope either by its number or color.

&nbsp;

*Begin Notes:*

Higher number indicates greater refinement and therefore more potent product. #1 and #2 are unusable, although I thought I read somewhere that #1 was either opium or morphine. Because of increased potency, #4 is more expensive then #3. But due to the ease of conversion, the majority of heroin will be #4 assuming it is in powder form.

&nbsp;

*Number Lookup:*

\#1 - Morphine? Opium?


\#2 - ???


\#3 - Freebase heroin. BTH. Brown power in Europe.  Smoke, shoot. Easy to convert to #4 to make snortable. Not water soluble, which makes it very inefficient to snort.
 

\#4 - HCL Heroin. East Coast Power. China White? Snort, smoke, shoot. Most potent form. (Add more info from Erowid)

&nbsp;

*Color Lookup:*

White - Aka China White. Either pure #4 or a fent product? High quality dope? Good for shooting, sniffing, or smoking?

Black - Aka Black Tar Heroin. #3 only? Only good for smoking or shooting. Can be dissolved to make monkey water and then squirted into nose. Question: #3 is not supposed to be water soluble, so how can BTH be made into monkey water? Not exactly #3? 

Grey - Aka East coast powder, (assuming USA). Primarily #4. Good for smoking, shooting, or sniffing. 

Brown - Possibly the same as grey? One comment I saw said that brown was a freebase form seen in Europe.

&nbsp;

This is probably common knowledge and I understand not wanting to spend time educating on basic topics. Of the content listed, I am most interested in learning what #2 and #1 actually are. If there is a way to give a quick 30 second summary in a way a layperson could understand, it would be appreciated. 

Besides that, I am happy to get any feedback on any missing information, information you think would be useful to include, or information that I got wrong.  But as stated previously, I primarily want to learn what #1 and #2 are.

&nbsp;

Links I browsed to gather this info in case anyone is interested.

I missed her and I still do, and maybe it never gets any easier, but it does get manageable. I have to move on, right? In an attempt to do just that, and after meeting a girl, I convinced her to come with me, and we decided to leave. Where we were going wasn't entirely unimportant, just as long as I was getting away from both where I was, and the place I had been in, if you know what I mean. 
A very cold, very long winter in the Pacific North West accompanied by many mistakes, a relationship ending in a very bad breakup, and a five month addiction crippled me yet again. My time in Portland ended with me losing 30 pounds (not in the good way), being broke, broken hearted, and just broken in general. I had nothing, nowhere, and no one left, so I moved back home. At least back in Oklahoma I had a few lifelong friends, some family that probably cared somewhere deep down, and a warm place to sleep. I had my car back home too, I hadn't brought it with me when I moved, so things weren't all bad. I hated home, but I settled, because, well, what else could I have done? I got a job, got back in school, and now I'm floating along through the monotony, waiting on life's next big adventure to sweep me away. I can't stay here, I guess you could say it isn't my 'destiny'-I never used to believe in fate, but if I'm sure of one thing, it's that I have to go somewhere, do something, make life a bit more interesting. We only get the one, after all. I couldn't stand to let myself squander my single chance at happiness and meaning, couldn't let one event or one person control my future, and certainly couldn't even imagine ending it before I see all there is to see, experience things very few ever get to, and really just live a little. But that's just the problem, isn't it? I could imagine it. In fact, the thought crosses my mind at least twice a day. Why is that? Are some of us simply destined for misery? The longest stints of happiness I can remember since I was sixteen were brought on artificially, cost a small fortune, and hurt everyone around me almost as much as myself. But it is happiness, nonetheless, even if some may call it delusion. I'm happy in my delusions, I live for the short periods of peace within my own mind, and nothing anyone says can change that.

I used to be able to afford dinner.

My dose has fluctuated in the last week or two, but generally is around .5 of dope a day. Sometimes less, sometimes much more.

Last used at 10AM, roughly 2 hours ago.

There are 4 8mg strips on my kitchen table.
When should I dose the subs?
How much?

Rod in my leg from a shattered femur in accident. Having bad arthritis problems and MRI showed a popliteal cyst + small joint effusion + thickened medial patellar plica. 

Rheumatologist gave me naproxen and told me to come back in a month and see an orthopedic doctor in meantime. 


So yesterday I went to the orthopedic doctor. He moved my knee all over and says it's the medial plica that's the problem? He gave me a cortisone shot and a follow up in 2 weeks. Said to keep taking the naproxen. And if the cortisone doesn't help he said they can go in and scrape down the plica where it's creating a fold... I don't know I kind of want a second opinion? 

This pain is keeping me from working and I'm torn on how to fix it. I'm hesitant to let a doctor I met for 20 minutes tell me to just have him go in and scrape stuff and be on my way. I have a rod in my leg and arthritis so it's not like the pain ends here. He kept making it sound like the medial patellar plica that showed up in my MRI is all I have wrong. And that surgery plus physical therapy (mindyou im still out of work for all this) is the answer to make it all better. 

I'm gonna see my regular GP who I have an extensively long and more personal relationship with and ask for recommendations on what to do or what doctors to see. Should I be going to pain management? I don't know anymore. I just know the pain is driving me crazy and naproxen and laying around all day isn't helping me. My quality of life is total shit now.

Travelling kids? I am putting together a zine and looking for contributions.,"Hey guys, 

I used to be a regular on this sub under a different account. Now I am almost 3 years clean and play in a punk band (by the same name as my username). I'm putting together a zine to distribute at our shows and online. For those not familiar with zines, they are unofficial short publications that circulate in music scenes, mostly punk shows, and cover specific topics. The topic of this zine is stories and perspectives on addiction, recovery, and sobriety in the DIY music scene. 

I am looking for any contributions and you can remain anonymous in the publication. Topics you can write about include:

-your personal story of addiction, especially if you relate to punk/alternative music culture. Especially if you are still in active addiction and do not identify as in recover/sober/clean

-loss of a friend, especially if you and them were involved in a music scene together

-harm reduction

-personal account on an overdose

-saving someone with narcan ( I would really like this, I haven't had anyone contribute on this topic yet ! )

-stories about living in a ""punk house"" or house that throws underground shows, and how it relates to substance use/addiction

Basically if you have anything to say about this topic I would love for you to contribute, whether it be a story, art, poetry, lyrics, or whatever. No minimum/maximum but 2 pages will probably be best for formatting. 

Just to clarify the topic, I'm including an excerpt from the introduction to the zine. Thank you in advance and be well !

""Keep in mind while reading through these stories that words like recovery, sober, and clean mean different things to different people. To some, they mean 100% abstinence. To others, they refer to abstinence from their drugs of choice. To some, they refer to moderation. Some of the stories in this zine are from people who are still actively using. Some people identify as straight edge. Others have attended rehab programs or participated in 12-step fellowships. Many more found recovery in completely other ways. Read these stories with an open mind and realize that just as there are many different paths into addiction, there are many paths out of it. For the purpose of this zine, all are legitimate and considered equal.""

Edit: I thought of another topic that would be cool if someone could write on: street/DIY detox/withdrawal guide",1495547396.0

  So I was wondering how many times you have overdosed and if it made a big impact on your life and usage? Like was the first time you got brought back with Narcan was is a  spiritual experience? Did it put your life into perspective, if so how? Or are there more people like me and it didn't do anything except for like the 20th time, 
Unfortunately I have overdosed a lot and I have  many hospital bills to prove that but my last and final one was over a year ago when I had a  different feeling than from the rest of times, normally I would mentally be fine as soon as they gave me the Narcan but this time I felt brain damage or something, it was weird as shit, I honestly felt slow like my brain was not comprehending everything at a normal pace. Its hard to explain but I just felt retarded. Eventually it wore off and I went  back to myself but it was scary as shit, it definitely left an impression, it changed me for life,

It happened Sunday afternoon. 
I'm still in shock. 
I knew he was spiraling.  He knew he was spiraling. I just didn't know how badly/quickly
His doctors dropped the ball when his psychiatrist moved.. so his normal meds weren't given to him for two months. 
he had gotten himself into a program that was supposed to be getting him back on suboxone, but they kept pushing back him seeing the prescribing doctor, so he had a peer support he was seeing who he kept having to teach and a therapist who knew she was out of her element. 
Plus she and love  were also horribly concerned about some physical health issues that he was experiencing. He was scared. 

Then my meds went missing. He admitted to it, then he started going to meetings. I was both proud and terrified. Willingly going to a meeting means for him shit is bad. We're both on the spectrum, social interaction in a meeting type is not his comfort zone. 

He'd always hated those meetings. And they were kind of a temptation for him.
 
Then he stole $400. 

From start to finish this was a little over two weeks of arguing. And realizing I was arguing with the addict about a week into it. 
Who knew he was saying awful things he didn't mean. 
Who I knew he was saying things he didn't mean..
I snuggled with him Saturday night. I told him I was still mad but that I really needed his snuggles. 
I can't remember if I was affectionate Sunday morning. 


Sunday night he came home from work. He said he stayed late but I don't know what's true. 
He showed me the chicken he'd make for dinner. I didn't get up to hug him because he was on his way to the kitchen and I was lying on the futon.


He said he'd use the bathroom then come make dinner.


I lost track of time. I didn't check on him soon enough. I knew as soon as I knocked.
I had to find a butter knife to open the door. 
I saw what he had and 
I've never seen anyone look like that. So..purple. And all I could think was ""no dear..not like this"" I couldn't find a pulse..I kept slapped him, I called 911 but could barely focus. I kept apologizing to dispatch for yelling.I think I broke loves rib. 
I had to stop cpr to let them into the fucking building. 

They wouldn't let me back in to say goodbye. They left all the medical shit they used on him in my house. 
I found more yesterday. 
I'm going back today. 

I knew he was dead because someone laughed. And one cop just kept talking about how routine it was for them all..like that made it better. And kept asking me if I hid anything or if I used.
I was worried about my spouse, I didn't think I should be hiding anything. 

Only one person there sat next to me on the floor and acted like my life just fell apart. 

Everyone else just wanted to contact the family, and then made sure to let me know I pretty much have no rights because we weren't legally married yet.

I am so numb.

My question is will using the Oxy screw up my dopamine/neurotransmitter levels further and prolong the comedown? Or do you think it's ok to use the stuff for a couple of days just so I can function/not want to jump off a tall building.

So I have a total of three connects in my area (A, B & C). A I have known since I moved to this city five years ago. He's a real nice guy, I would probably consider him a friend at this point. His dope is the best quality by far, the cheapest and he will always front. The only downside to him is that he lives out of his car and is sometimes 30 mins to and hour away. He also has lapses where he did too much himself or fronted too much and can't cop another piece right away. So that sometimes sucks. But all in all he's great. B has shitty stuff, is super expensive, always shorts and is overall not a nice person. But yet always has and always answers. C is batshit crazy and I try to avoid her at all costs but sometimes I have no other choice. That is until today. 

I copped last night but of course I committed the cardinal sin and didn't leave anything for the morning. ""Oh of course A will have when I wake up, he usually does"". Ha. Yeah right. So I wasn't too terribly sick when I got up. I hit up A when I woke up and he said it's gna be a few hours. I owe B some cash so I didn't really want to hit her up. And C I only call if I'm completely, completely desperate. I decide to wait for A, if he doesn't have in the am he is usually good by lunch time. Not ideal but whatever.

I try not too blow him up every hour cuz no one likes that. Noon rolls by and I decide to call, he bitch buttons me. Not a good sign. Anyways, I go to the stairwell at work (our office is in a shopping complex thingy) and walk to the top to smoke a cig where I always do. I notice there's a dude at the very very top posted with his skate and backpack smoking a cig too, so I stay one level below him and smoke.

Fast forward an hour and I go out to call A again and to smoke another cig. As I get to the top of the stairwell I notice the dude is still there but he didn't see me this time. I walked down a level again and lit my cig and I hear the flicking of a lighter multiple times. I decide to head back up to the dude to see what he's doing. As I get close enough on the stairs I see that he has what looks like a crack pipe in his hand. He had the ""oh shit"" face on so I say to the dude ""oh don't worry bro I don't care at all but do you have any boy too???"" Turns out the dude was smoking BTH off foil not crack or meth! Haha. I tell him I'm starting to get sick and been waiting on my guy to answer etc. He then gives me the foil and let's me rip it a couple times. I proceeded to ask him if he had some for sale and of course he does. Fuck yeah. So I copped a quick half to test it. Of course took his number as well. Turns out he lives 4 blocks from me and says he always has and is always available. Fuck yeah again. I head to the car to get well and decide to drive down the street to 7/11 to grab some sour patches before I go back to work. As I roll up I see this guy I used to cop blues from before I made the jump in the parking lot. He went to jail back then and I never heard from him since. He remembers me and we get to talking. Turns out he now sells boy and gave me his new number and a free point to sample. Fuck yeah x3! 

So it looks like B & C just moved down a few notches haha. But shit I thought this was crazy. Been back in the game for 6 months with no new connects really and then out of nowhere voila! 

Sorry for the novel but I just had to share this.

I was on here for a while myself. Iv heroin user for about 4 years, smoked crack for about 9 months as well. But every time I tried to quit I could not. I now have 14 months COMPLETELY sober and happier than I've ever been. When I was 21 I went into a coma for 12 days. Shouldn't be alive today. But I am. And im sober.

Genuine, and happy sobriety. Please reach out if you're struggling. I live in Ohio. And as many of you know it's ground zero for carfentinyl. And many of my friends and loved ones are dying.

All of the content you find here is real and gritty. It's not painted and colorful, but it gives you the real score and it also gives you insight into the bittersweet world that is opiate addiction. All of the hustles, the dope porn, the JJ stories, the shitposts, the dead but not really posts, harm reduction, jail time stories, and everything in between, just shows you that everyone on this sub is just a normal person dealing with another kind of struggle and battle. 



Thank you for being real and for taking care of each other. Weirdly enough, it is in this drug forum that you can find a lot of supportive posts and a sense of community. I don't really plan on taking opiates anytime soon, but I will continue to lurk and maybe comment and post a bit more if you'll have me.

Sorry about that, it made sense in my head and still does.  
But I wrote the end of the story of Adam and his chick anyway.  Lets call her Kaitlyn.


So lets fast forward a few years.  Adam and Kaitlyn have been together on and off since a week or so after that night.  Since they got together he's spiralled out of control.  

They're both living on the streets more often than not.  
She's turning ticks while telling him she's not, he's robbing houses.  

I've had to give him CPR 3 times in the last month alone.  He's so loaded I don't even want to be around him, he's a liability.

Every time we hang out alone all he talks about is how worried about her he is.    
Meanwhile she's perfectly fine with this life, shes in her element.    

We get together and hang out about once a week.  This is the story of one of the last times we hung out.  

They actually managed to find someone who'd let them rent a room.  
It's what looks like a converted walk in closet with the wall paper pealing. 

Someone from Adam's job vouched for them on the lease. 
He's working security for some of the gated communities in the area (oh the irony).  

They threw in half the money for 2 grams of tar that was new stuff, and supposed to be fire.   
We get there and divide it up sitting on the floor in their tiny room.  

Things are going good tonight, Kaitlyn isn't starting arguments about nothing, Adam can actually walk in a straight line and stand unassisted.   What more can a friend ask for?  

We prep our shots while Elliott Smith plays in the background.  
I have to hit both of them first because they suck at finding veins.  

""this is weird, good though""  says Adam, his eyes blink in what looks like slow motion.

Kaitlyn just lays back against the wall and closes her eyes, but her breathing hasn't changed.  

I go to the bathroom to stash my dope before I do my shot and get some crystal to mix in (They didn't have any, and I didn't want to share).  

I get back and borrow Kaitlyn's hand mirror to hit my neck,  as soon as I push the plunger down I can feel something is wrong.  

A huge rush then a sudden loss of coordination, a tightness in my chest and an inability to keep my eyes open.   

I fall out.  (this was my first experience with a fent cut)   

I come to an hour or two later. I'm laying on my side on the floor with a blanket over me.  I have to struggle to stay conscious.  

Adam's nodding in and out on the bed.
Kaitlyn is in the corner spinning a burner.

""What happened?"" I ask.
""You died for a bit there, Adam gave you a sternum rub and CPR"" she states vaguely as the vapor trickles out of her mouth and nose.  

""Want some?"" she asks as she hold the burner out to me. 
I can barely hear her, its like the volume is turned down on the world.  I can't seem to put my thoughts into words.   

I drag myself up and lean on the wall, we smoke in silence for a bit.  

Not long after their landlord gets home from work.  He storms into the room.  Kaitlyn is in the bathroom Adam is passed out, and of course I'm holding the burner.   He looks livid.   ""WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!"" he screams.  

I still can't seem to put words together.
""I want you out now!"" He yells as he reaches down and pulls me to my feet by the front of my shirt.  

As I stumble out of the house at 5am, I realize my belt is undone, and my pants are unzipped.The top button is the only thing holding them up.  ""that's weird"" I think to myself.  I feel like I'm missing something significant.  

I walk around to the alley behind the house and listen to the man bellow at Adam.   About 30 min later A brings me my backpack and says.
""you gotta get out of here, the cops are on the way""  
They got kicked out that night. 

So I make my way back to my car and sit there 'till I feel ok enough to drive.  
Its not 'till I make it home that I realize what was bothering me earlier.   
My dope had been taped to the inside of my thigh, It was gone, along with all my money.    

They had robbed me minutes after I'd ODed.   I blamed it on Kaitlyn, until a month later when I got a call from my family.

Sometime between these two I ended up out on the streets too.  (that's a whole different story, for later if at all)  

Adam was sharing a tent with me on the days he didn't have anywhere else to go.   On the night after I got the call he stumbled into camp.  High as a kite, while I had spent the last week sick.  

As he plopped his ass down in the chair across the fire from me I said, ""Weren't we were supposed to look out for each other.""  It wasn't a question.

He got a guilty but belligerent look on his face, ""Kaitlyn was really sick!""  He said, voice raised and slurring.

""I don't give a fuck about Kaitlyn,  and this isn't about the dope or the money!""  I say, my voice raising with every word.

""What's it about then?"" He stands up as he shouts this, swaying on his feet.    

""You think I haven't noticed what's missing when you leave? But from my family too?  I ask, in a quite voice.  Still sitting as he towers over me.  

He can't hold eye contact.  He knows that once I stop yelling its a bad sign.   

My hands are shaking so much it knocks the cherry off my cig 

""Just go"" I say 

I want him gone, before I do something I'll regret later.  

That's how I lost one of my closest friends. Hopefully that wraps it up.

Well I'm finally going to quit using. Just had my last smoke and my girlfriend and I smoked a gram each in one, long, session. 

She's nodding off but I'm not - thoughts about quitting are really dampening my last high. 

Of course the last time I'm ever picking up (hopefully?) the main guy gives me a half-gram for free. I spend an astronomical amount and consider myself to be a solid customer and this is the first free dope I have ever received. 

On my last day of using. 

I can't really tell if that's a good sign to quit or not. 

For me, the hardest part about quitting is forever losing my connect. 
I'm well-liked among the Hondurans here and their motto is: ""we serve you everyday, or not at all."" 
Tomorrow will be the first time in well over six months that I haven't seen them. 

Their level of professionalism is unmatched. 
Always available and set regular hours of operation. 
They haven't missed a single call from me in the multiple months I've been doing business with them. 

They wrap it multiple times, always on point, usually on time to the location. These guys don't fuck around but they're incredibly savvy businessmen. 

I'll miss the daily routine of calling them up, driving to a random spot, bubbling with anticipation as I see one of their many cars arrive.. Some people on here have really shitty experiences with their ""dboys"" but I enjoy my business with them to such a degree that I wouldn't ever refer to them as dboys, but businessmen. 

I've come to terms that their motto of constant service has become detrimental to my life and should aid me in my recovery process. I have a suboxone script and access to the many comfort medications available.

After years with my dude, it's about 20 a point. Sometimes it's fent (""China white""), but if it's actually h, it's normally shitty. The dude is always able to meet up, so that's fine if he has decent stuff, but he is the type that thinks you're dumb and don't notice things. 


It's annoying as shit not being able to buy weight because he will try to short or give you a shitty batch he's been trying to get rid of. I'm normally meeting in a spot I shouldn't be, so I can't call him out right there, so then it becomes a drawn out ordeal. Normally takes awhile and he will make it somewhat right. Othertimes, he has been selling pills to me, and I can hear on the phone the guy say 25 a piece, he charges 30, but he is adamant he isn't making any money, just doing it to help me out. Like, bro, you're a dealer, I get the purpose of the game. Id rather him make money off me and be real about it.


 I understand this happens because I continue to buy from him, but he is the only person i know within three hours that sells h so there isn't much for me to do. I move to another state in a month,  so I'm just gonna make sure things are handled right there. Sometimes I just want to yell at him and let him know he's not fooling anyone.

To get to the point, this last time, I could swear the shit is cut with coke or lidocaine. The ""h"" is white so it blends, but it has that unmistakable taste. He mentioned he was reupping and I could get an extra bag when he gave me the cut shit, but I'm thinking he was super low on supply and needed my money to reup, so added some coke just to make weight.

But wtf, does he expect me not to notice? Anybody else ever seen this? Doesn't it seem counterintuitive to business? My eyes got a little pinned so it wasn't all coke. Anybody else have a dealer that thinks he is smarter than he is?",1495491292.0

Sorry if this breaks any rules, but I'm not sure where else to ask. 

My sister has been struggling with heroin addiction for a few years now and has been relapsing. 

She doesn't make much money and my parents have become very cautious about how they support her (if she's seriously low on money, they'd take her to dinner instead of giving her cash to buy food, write a check to the landlord instead of trusting her to pay), so, in theory, she shouldn't be able to afford to buy anything. 

The problem is that her dealer is selling her heroin on credit. 

For instance, she relapsed last week (and got carfentanyl as an unexpected extra) and currently owes her dealers $180.

Is this normal for dealers to do? 

From pretty much everything I've ever heard, drugs are a cash-up-front business, though I've never gotten into drugs beyond weed at a college party (forgive my ignorance). 

We come from an upper-middle class family and the dealer seems to be aware of this. 

Perhaps he knows we won't just straight-up give her cash for no reason, so he gives heroin to her on credit with the threat of hurting her if she doesn't pay later?

My parents definitely don't want to see her get beat up and will  give her the cash. 

She lives and buys in Milwaukee, if that makes any difference.

Edit: I forgot to mention, but she is on suboxone and seeing a therapist, which my parents pay for.",1495490375.0

This causes an issue with me and my girl as she is 8 years younger than me. She seems to take it personally as I have told her it's only when I take either one of those. In fact I perform much better sedated.

The old ass broad who is the psychologist said the clinc is hers and in order to do outpatient I would have had to be in patient for one week. She said I could get medical leave if work was a factor. Well in my state I can get fired without explanation and people have been fired before with medical leave.

Thanks to 50 bucks worth of Kratom and exercise I didn't fall for the old hags scare tactics and trying to make me feel like a Pos so I can buy into their likely overpriced program.


If these places are so serious about helping addicts then they should allow outpatient options without doing the detox for a week.

and that's just heroin, it's up there but I've heard there are drugs more brutal to come off of.

**Tramadol (O-desmethyl-Tramadol)z**

a opioid on the weak end of the scale ...but definitely an opioid and has interaction with the opioid receptors it's also very unique drug in the fact that it has serotonin and norepinephrine interaction making it a strong antidepressants as well as an pain reliever.

there seems to be some false information thrown around about tramadol, and has a real negative stigma to it.

things like that it is *NOT* an opiate things like you will have a seizure if you take it just once you will have a seizure...  and that it's a  dirty drug.... whatever that means.

I think a lot of this comes from a low-prevalence outside of Europe. Ultram is very popular in the UK and is the go to prescription pain reliever for any GP in the UK. is no Vicodin,no hydros and no Oxcodone. 
is it's just tramadol and codeine basically and if you want a benzo  your lucky get Valium or maybe a hypnotic like temazepam -- no Ambien or Xanax.

basically I just wanna promote **TRAMADOL to as it being a very cheap drug (*whereas oxy onthe at street you need to re mortgage your house for a blister strip of x 20*)

 I want to promote its abilities to completely get rid of withdrawal symptoms and it will shrink detox down to 0 no matter how big your habit. also it must be known about tramadol is that it actually gets stronger; .. along with its long half life... It gets more potent as you redose, which is very rare amongst the opiates.

 if you take 100 mg and then further 25-40mg increments you will be feeling good and have no problems with sickness, and if you're opiate naive,250mg in a day will get you high,subs Dan, but won't do that much 

400mg is the dose recommended to surpass as it can cause sexiness are very high doses. Usually as a dope user your tolerance is high and don't need to surpass that because you won't be getting high anyway -- but avoid it as seIures can happen 

I've been taking the drug for about 5 years and never had  a seizure at rises like 550mg. I was full blown nodding during  withdrawal. 

 in conclusion; I know that tramadol isnt a go to drug to get high because usually if you're using heroin or Oxy tramadol is it going to come near to that unfortunately because it is a fairly weak opiate but it *IS/.**an opiate and it is a strong antidepressant, increasing also norepenephrine and it's also very cheap opioid, so if you're looking for a substitute other than Subutex and methadone tramadol is the BES  drug for detox and it Will completely  remove the symptoms of detox without the need for loperamide or other supplements t tramadol can be used entirely on its own and they will deliver.

a A perfect dosage spread out throughout the day is like 300 mgb and u can work your way up that during the day as like I said it is better used when REDOSED.

I got clean March 31st, and moved into sober living about two weeks ago. Everything was going great, I was actually trying... I am far from home so i know nobody here, i don't even know where i would start to look if i wanted to cop. Hell I would probably get lost on my way to McDonald's.

That is until I was walking to the corner store for some mtn dew and smokes. I turn the corner literally three minutes after leaving my house, a guy walks from his garage and asks to bum a cig. After we sit there smoking and bull shitting. He drops the bombshell on me.. ""You fuck with boi?"" And I'm just thinkin fuck my life dude. Without hesitation I say yes. I have been answering that question for so long with the same answer, it was a instinct.

He gives me a tester and I end up using it. And god damn was it fire. The problems I am now faced with are as follows.. One, I don't want to live a lie in this program, I don't want everyone to think I have X amount of days sober when it is really just a handful if that. Two, I now have the killing desire to use again, and that won't go away anytime soon. Three, I now know a dope boy literally a couple steps from my house. I don't know what to do friends. I really really feel guilty and don't want to lie to everyone. But if I say something I risk getting kicked out..

What would you guys do in this situation? I actually want to try this time around, and I'm scared because this is my only place to stay. If something were to happen and I got kicked out, I am a two and a half hour drive from anybody I actually know. Fuck, I hate heroin. ",1495615693.0

The lust of a boy left in pain



Twas was fine in the beginning 

I thought that I was winning

Her name was morphine

And she was so sweet

What little did I know



She made me feel great and she made me feel safe

She let me fall in her arms

And then one day

To my great shame

I cannot defecate



Oh I pushed and I shoved

But my ass it was plugged 

My hole had now torn

And my body was worn

Yet there's no salvation in crying

Well, right before I deposited it into my market wallet, I checked the subreddit for said DNM and there were several very recent reports of people losing their BTC or it never showing up in their market wallet, plus a bunch of other sketchy shit so I decided to hold off until things cleared up. 

Ended up getting distracted, kinda put it off/forgot about it until today when I'm a lil short on cash to pick up a ball as I normally do every couple of days and I remember that not only do I have BTC in one of my wallets but I've been closely watching as BTC (as well as ETH and LTC) have been blowing the fuck up, hitting an all-time high in value. So, now my original $150 is worth $215. Nice. So I head over to our local mall to sell some BTC at the Bitcoin ATM. Get there, start processing the withdrawal/sale of my BTC, except the ATM is low on cash due to the high volume of transactions recently from the spike in value. It says it only has $120 cash left, FUCK. That's barely enough for a half-ball... whatever, at least I can grab something to hold me over and I won't be sick at work tomorrow.

So I finish processing the transaction and it starts dispensing my cash... when all of the sudden an error screen pops up that states: ""You have attempted to withdraw 120 USD. We are sorry, but processing transaction failed"" I'm a lil confused cuz I see several 20s sitting in the tray, so I pull them out, count them up and I have $100 cash. The error screen directs me to contact a local number via text for customer support. I let him know the situation and send him a screenshot of the error screen and transaction ID as requested. The only thing I don't mention is that it dispensed $100, leaving me only $20 short before throwing that error screen. He promptly apologizes saying that the ATM ran out of cash but it will be restocked tomorrow, and he can either reimburse me via BTC or meet me early in the AM with $120 cash. I tell him I can't meet him in the morn due to a conflicting work schedule (true story) so he asks for a BTC address and just as I was hoping for, he reimburses me for the entire $120 worth of BTC instead of the difference of $20. Fucking score!!!

And then as if I wasn't already having a hella nice day, my dude shows up waaay earlier than I had expected him to, offers to front me the other half of the ball without me asking or hinting that I'd be interested in that, telling me that he knows I'm good for it and that he doesn't want to push it on me but I can ask for whatever I want fronted. Bet it, I take him up on a ball. And then the fucking kicker, he just so happens to have Suboxone strips on him!! He offers to front those to me as well, originally asking for $15 a piece and I don't wanna ask for too many or run up too much of a tab after he just fronted me a half ball, so I request a respectable 3 strips. He says, ""fuck it, what are you gonna do with just 3 strips? let's drop the price down to $10 and take 5 of em"".

Now I'm on my way home, $100+ richer, a ball of fire dope in my pocket to hold me over til the weekend and enough Suboxone to complete a rapid taper whenever I'm ready or to just keep the sickness at bay for those days when everything falls thru and you're left dopeless with sickness in the imminent future.

I gotta say, today was a good day...

TL;DR: Bitcoin ATM error made me $100 richer, dboy offers to front basically whatever I want now, been searching for subs for several weeks now and they randomly fall in my lap today at a killer price",1495598729.0

So, first of all, i just want to say this community is crazy and much like a family, I don't know how some of you get literally hundreds of pills via prescription, idunno if you guys have broken every bone in your body to get it, but thats cool, not my business entirely

I just wanna say that i am by no means planning to stick with opiates, they're the only thing that works for my sciatica, as Lyrica made me attempt suicide back in 2014 and i don't want to get back on that despite the doctor pushing it down my throat (figuratively).

I take no more then 240mg of codeine a day, which i believe is the normal max limit you get prescribed

But, I have a question in regards of Codeine and the withdrawals after im done using it...

Is it a shitty time compared to... oxycontin? oxycodone (i dont know the difference, sorry), morphine? I was told that it was a weaker opiate compared to them... but does that mean the WD wont be as bad compared to the meds i listed above?

I guess the question about addiction is the same, is addiction bad compared to the meds i mentioned above?

Thank you all so much for the answers you'll give me, you're all good folk.

EDIT Quick little edit, ive been using codeine since late 2014 after my... suicide attempt.... I assume the ""how long have you been using"" will be asked... but please note that i have taken breaks, im not on them every day, i only take as i need.",1495598621.0
6czs5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6czs5o/bless_junkie_jesus_and_another_rant_on_the_wait/,13,https://redd.it/6czs5o,sloan_fitch,Bless Junkie Jesus and another rant on the wait,"I typed yesterday but lost it all due to a browser crash. Shitty when that happens. Not to mention, I visit this place using a Tor browser and having auto-save extensions and add-ons would be antithetical to the whole not making tracks and maintaining a modicum of anonymity. 

First I'll rehash and share my thoughts from yesterday but most assuredly in a far more succinct manner because I want to get to the climax of today's story. I have a friend who is hooked on perc ten's and he doesn't snort or shoot them. Can't really snort them because acetaminophen that's mixed in will make you puke. What he does is, chew on them. Literally chews on them. I tried it once, tasted like shit. I prefer these as a backup opiate for emergencies and I typically need to take three before a shift at work to get right. Won't get a not but it gets the job done. One time I was deep in WD and took 1.5 and it barely did anything. So I guess mileage varies depending on biological factors. 

So of course I'm not judging my friend for chewing on his percs, it just surprises me as an ROA. Sometimes he'll chew on 7 of them, puke and then chew on five more to recoup his high. He also likes oxy's but you can't always get your hands on those. Not until this week when he went to an ""addiction doctor"". Apparently they operate on theory that they're gonna taper you down at a very slow rate while making massive money. The doc called my friend a junkie by saying ""your pain is a three and your addiction is a 9"" ... ""you are a junkie."" Sigh and the doc is a fucking dope dealer. Cost my friend two grand overall for the experience including filling his script. Furthermore the doc won't fill future scripts unless he (the patient) comes back with the empty bottles from the previous month. You see, it's like you get three scripts for 1 or 2 hundred blues. They each cost a fortune to fill since this doc doesn't take my pal's insurance and so he can't just take the first bottle and not fill the other two scripts. Thus, he now has to consider selling a bunch to cover his cost.....

It's shitty to him because he just wanted to get the opiates in the most legit way possible. He was tired of the waiting game and the chasing game. In fact, I've never heard of him complaining about the wait as I do. It's just annoying because he knows people who know people but none of them ever want to put him touch with anyone directly. I get it, decades in jail over a single pill. I just feel so bad for him that he tried to do things in a legit manner and is now forced to consider taking the very risks he intended on avoiding by going to this special type of doctor. He can easily flip his pills and cover his own addiction (unless his ceiling raises) but he doesn't want to end up in a situation where his wife leaves him and he loses his kids.

Of course he can simply not fill those other scripts and be done with this asshole doctor but he's also weighing the fact that he'd be giving up a somewhat decent connect despite the aforementioned shortfalls. We also spoke about options for quitting and I mentioned Suboxone and Buprenorphine patches. I think they're both very good options. The Bupe should be done on a lower dose IMO and the Subs should be taken cautiously and tapered down. He doesn't like WD symptoms and is afraid of facing them in CT as much as the next person but like me doesn't fully realize that our tolerance ceiling is not as high as many other users. Maybe he has a higher ceiling because of his capacity to chew down oxy's but I can't be certain. 

_______________________________________

Yesterday I was waiting on a half bun + my friend was ordering for himself. That didn't pan out for any of us. So the plan was to pick up in the morning or get delivery before I start work at 4PM. A bit before noon another friend says that dboy will be coming by ""early afternoon"". Then at 1:15 he's in the shower and will be over soon. Oh speaking of the word ""soon"", yeah that was the ETA for the day prior.... that did not fucking pan out. So 3:45 rolls around, I have no choice but to go to work. But it's okay, during my shift surely my friend will let me know that the dope has arrived and this will give me motivation to work on through. Nosiree. I was lucky though, the friend who chews on percs loaned me three blues until next week. 

First I ripped one. Then I told m friend who was driving out to dboy that I have one with his name on it. Dboy was not home. Backup dboy isn't gonna be around until 3AM. Maybe sooner but we've gotta assume the worst. So I'll split my third blue with my friend because I don't have work tomorrow and I'm confident that my friend will a have the dope by the time I wake up tomorrow.

From there I'll count on him to get me some subs and if he doesn't I'll buy some subs when I get paid next week. I'll also order some Kratom. I need a warchest to prevent dopesickness in the future and to broaden my options to get off dope. Last time I had assistance form a Bupe patch, I felt right as rain by day 4 and it held. Nobody has Bupe patches so I have to get Subs and will take them cautiously.

Still can't get over the revised ETAs from dboy. Why can't shit just work out as planned and properly more frequently than it does? It's like 1 in 5 dope orders go perfectly. From there 1 in 5 goes bluderously wrong, like not on time for work, and not waiting for me after work like today except for the dumb luck and change of fortune that I encountered. Then like 3 in 5 may go adequately well but not without a wait. Still those 3 in 5 go better than the blunderous times albeit only slightly so at times.

Anyway, thank you Junkie Jesus for helping me out this evening! ",1495597934.0

Warning, long ass post.","Pretty much what the title says. I've been thinking about this a fair bit. Firstly, i first became addicted to opiates after developing a chronic pain problem, it was the only thing that made life bearable for about 2 years and saved my life. I then stumbled upon an amazing training program which uses the powers of neuroplasticity to retrain the brain out of the chronic pain response.


 It was amazing, i had hope again, hope of a normal life, a life not being reliant on pills, a life being able to do shit normal people take for granted. It was going great, after 4 months i had come off of all opiates, reduced my pain from 8/10 90% of the time to 2/10 30% of the time, quit smoking weed, ( was a daily smoker for 15 years) was exercising twice a day and in the best shape of my adult life, even joined a basketball team again which was something that i never thought i'd be able to do again and i was waking up happy for the first time in about 8 years since i abused ecstasy and other party drugs hard for 3 years.


Then came the beginning of the end. I foolishly thought i was ready to date again, i felt so whole. I met up with this girl who at the time i thought was the most amazing person I'd ever met and i fell hard for her. Like uncontrollably both feet off the ground hard, I'd have taken a bullet for her at the time. It was my first time being in love, i was always the one who broke hearts and i always had my feet on the ground and was the one in control. She made out like she was falling for me too, i had never felt so happy to be alive.


Fast forward a bit, my true feelings are revealed and the bitch breaks up with me via fkn text message and won't even see me or take my calls. Then i spiralled like never before. I started smoking cigs again which i hadn't done in years, i was drinking half a bottle of whisky a night, was just sitting alone crying, drinking and chain smoking for a solid month. Then poppies started popping up all over my property, didn't take much thought to start ripping them and smoking opium laced cigs and making pod tea. I lost all mental clarity and control over my thoughts, my pain started returning to what it was without my being vigilant in patrolling my thoughts. Alcohol sucks so i went back to my doc got oxy and morphine scripts again, bought a bunch of weed and the rest is history. 


It's now 8 months since she broke my heart without an explanation. I know i have the power to start again, to choose happiness, to retrain my brain out of chronic pain, i know how to do it. Don't get me wrong it's by far the hardest thing i ever did training my brain out of CP, but it is doable with the right knowledge and mindset. Yet i just keep numbing myself with opiates and weed. I have 0 motivation to live a sober life. Even though i now despise the girl with all my heart for how she left me i feel like a part of me died when she left. It took me 15 years to find love and it was one of the worst things that has happened to me. If one is to live a sober life we must find outlets, be social, exercise, date etc. and i just feel like I'll never want these things again. Occasionally i go on a date now usually with a stoner girl and we have a smoke and i walk away despite the girls obvious interest. I just wanna get fkd up on pills and most non users aren't ok with opiate use and fk living a lie anyways. 


I miss being happy and feeling wonder, i miss exercise induced endorphins, i miss sex and intimacy, i'm lonely with only the company of my cat and occasional social outings. Despite all of this i still have zero desire to start again. I just don't know how to love and trust again and the only thing that makes this bearable is opiates. This ended up way longer than I originally intended so thanks to those that read my story. Anyone else feel like losing someone you loved with all your heart is one of your primary reasons you can't stop this shit?


TLDR: Bitch broke my heart and I'm now dead inside and have no desire to live a normal life without opiates as a result.",1495579772.0

Wish I knew lol) I figured I'd share some pointers and a pic of ones I KNOW to be fent pills.
Not the best quality pic. I do apologize. Will try to get better ones in different lighting for you soon. 
http://imgur.com/a/hZSlc
Most noticable difference:
1.Color: As you can see in the pic the color is off, it's more of a white with blue specs vs the consistently light blue real ones which are alot darker in color. 
2.Imprint: The imprints from front to back don't line up at all. When you hold a real one with the mbox right side up you should be able to flip it and the line be straight across the middle. On the fakes nine times out of ten the line and 30 imprint do not line up. 
3.Texture: The fent ones crumble very easily. With the real you can snap them in half by hand pretty easily and get a clean break, doing so with the fent ones you usually end up with a bunch of crumbs vs 2 halves. 
4.Shape: The edges on the fake ones aren't very crisp like the real ones. They have a flat edge vs a rounded ridged edge.
5. Taste: Real mbox30s have a distinct taste. The fent ones have little to no taste. I don't get any taste from the fent drip. The only time I've gotten any taste from them it's almost very faint sweet taste and I had to put it directly on my tongue to taste even that much. 

Always, always treat your pills as if they are fent unless you picked them up from the pharmacy with your name on the bottle yourself. Even after doing these for months I still always only do very miniscule bumps at a time. 1/4 of one of the fent pills is enough to knock you on your ass. Always remember you can redose, but you can't ever un-dose. Some of the fakes are easy to spot right away, but Everytime the dboy reups they look more and more like the real thing. If I didn't have the real ones to compare side by side and didn't know these were fent I probably wouldn't be able to tell myself.Thankfully we have an amazing dboy that doesnt try to sell these as the real deal. He tells each and every person he sells them to that they are fent and to be very careful because a little goes a long way...but not everyone is that nice. And of course not every fake mbox30s or any of the fakes are going to look the same. It depends on who is pressing them and what they're being cut with etc. These specific ones are from the Georgia/Florida area. (Hopefully the location is okay because it is purely meant for harm reduction and I didn't provide any kind of exact location). Hopefully this will be helpful to somebody somewhere. 
And if you have any further questions feel free to ask!
As always safe and happy nods! ",1495572601.0

Said fuck it i got this, nauscious as fuck, tried to throw down a g scoop in one. As soon as it got on my tongue, instinctively my mouth closed up for a second and it hit the roof of my mouth.

I had a long-term IV heroin habit and was also on MMT when I left here last May to get clean. This day last year I'd still be in a detox facility, or possibly just getting out. 

I don't consider myself clean at all, but at the very least I've completely avoided opiates and needles for an entire year and my life really has improved. I barely even miss dope anymore although it still crosses my mind pretty often. 

It is possible and I just wanted to contribute another mild ""success story"" from someone who was a raging junkie who couldn't imagine life without dope. Hell even the first few months off of it were spent fantasizing about it and battling my cravings 24/7. That shit does pass though even if it feels like it never will. 

Take care. If you're trying to get off it, there's hope. If you're not trying to get off it, no judgement from me. Just everyone be careful.

Anyway, him and I had a good relationship, mostly because I never asked for a front and was a loyal customer. My old middle that ultimately introduced me to dboy hit me up randomly today for the first time since Thanksgiving to catch up a little bit. He switched over to suboxone and hasn't really touched h for a while, but still has dboy's number which was news to me that he saved it. Score for one for the good guys!

Middle calls dboy, we head over to meet up. Dboy doesn't know that I'm gonna be with middle, so when I walked through the door he is genuinely happy to see me. So I ask for .5 of china to which he tells me he only has .1, but has tar. So I say that's fine, I'll take .8 tar and the last .1 of china. The tar came in one hunk and looked pretty big. Sometimes appearances can be deceiving so I just thank him, tell him it was great to see him and head towards home

I get home and I'm thinking ""damn, that's just a big ole chunk, I wonder how close to .8 it is?"" Bust out the scale, throw the rock on there and ...

1.4! Holy shit! I had been getting shit from him almost daily for a couple years until my most recent sober time (which ended in April, but that was one time and my only slip since 2017 started) and he hasn't ever made such a mistake.

It is effecting my job. I'm in front of people on a daily basis and I've had times where people have mentioned that they were chilly and I'm in front of them drenched in sweat. The worst part is I only sweat from my side burns, head, and sides of my nose. I am on 100mg of methadone a day. We've tried upping to 140 and even lowering but nothing has helped. 

After a bit of research I tried taking benadryl to see if it would help (people reported improvements while on it). It did seem to help but not 100% and taking benadryl everyday wouldn't be easy considering how tired it makes me on top of methadone/dope. 

The doctor at my clinic cannot prescribe any medications. They do sell 'Vitadone' which supposedly helps. However, looking at the ingredients it is basically just a multi-vitamin and I doubt something like that could have a big impact especially on the severity of my sweats. 

I usually dose around 9am and the sweats usually surface around 1pm-4pm. I've also noticed that if my blood sugar is low it makes it much worst. 

So, to sum this up. Methadone gives me 2 terrible side effects: Sweating & Hot flashes. I'm wondering if anyone on this forum knows of any PRESCRIPTION based drugs that would help sweating.

I don't really have anyone else to talk to, and my boyfriend has always raved about Reddit and he used to be completely enthralled with this opiates subreddit. So I'll give a little background first for anyone who cares to read ....

I'm about to be 23 years old and I'm a female living in the the tristate area. I've been dating my boyfriend for over 6 years since we were 16. For the first few years we were together drugs were never a part of our relationship. He has a brother about to turn 21 who is a recovering heroin addict but he stopped young, about 16. So anyways my bf would always mess around with drugs when he was younger but It would be only when available. He never sought it out. Probably did hard drugs once every two months if he stumbled upon them at a party or concert or something. Fast forward to summer 2013, he's working at a place with a buddy who sells him perc 30's 10 for $100. Then one thing leads to the next and now we're living in a part of a city where heroins around every corner. We were what you'd call ""functional addicts"", he got great grades In college I held a full time job we kept relationships and appearances up. We got caught, and by the power invested in us stopped without treatment. Dabbled in NA but didn't commit. We wanted each other more than the drugs. We have never stolen from each other never screwed each other over, it was the type of relationship where I'd give him my last bag so HE wasn't sick and vice versa. Anyways, we fell back into using. And a few months ago it became cocaine too. And he started using needles. All the time. And we fought and fought because that was one thing that I couldn't be okay with. It was consuming our time, energy, love. Suddenly we weren't waking up in the morning, enjoying snorting our lines and then cuddling, we were waking up and he was locked in the bathroom for 30 minutes and then came back a ghost of himself. So eventually he got caught and sent to rehab about 2 months ago. He's fortunate enough to have parents who are not only very involved in local programs for helping families cope with loved ones addiction and such, but they are able to provide, through good insurance and hard earned money, a very decent rehab experience for him. I tried to quit alone out here without anyone knowing. To make a long story not AS long, it didn't work. And now he's been in rehab for 2 months getting better and I'm out here lying to everyone I love, right on the verge of being able to FINALLY have the future I want with the man I love unconditionally (here's a little shout out to you babe, I am SO fucking proud of you. Keep getting better everyday) and I'm about to fuck it all up because I can't admit to them I need help. But I have to. If I want any chance of a happy life with not only him but his family, my family, my friends, I need to seek help. I'm not working I'm broke and I'm tired. I can't do it on my own. But like I said, I don't have money. Or insurance. I guess the point of all this is me reaching out to the opiates community asking if anyone has any knowledge or advice to help me figure out how to get into a decent rehab with very few resources available to me, and how I'd go about paying for it. If anyone has any advice or answers or needs more information , feel free to message me privately so I can give you more details on where I'm from and all. Thank you to whoever reads this.

The fucking dope was supposed to be on hand by the time I wake up.** Well that's been fucking hours and I'm sitting here with no drugs. The person who was bringing the dope has a vehicle with distinct noise. I heard it clearly while laying down. So I jump up, see it passing by out my window and I text my friend to notify him the guy should be at his house in one minute.

At that point I was happy, thinking the wait was almost over. Oh fucking no it wasn't. Apparently the guy had a story for my friend and offered him crack in lieu of dope. Then after I waited 15 minutes I was informed of these details. Apparently we're now waiting for this fucking jerk to come back with his car keys so that my friend can use his car to go score. WTF?!!!? 

I feel okay right now, whereas my friend is already hurting pretty significantly. Makes me wonder if it was worth it to split my third pill with him last night. Well hell, I know he'll pay back the favor. The good news is that my friend did get his money back but we still have to wait for the car keys to be dropped off. This is some fucking shit. I knew it wasn't gonna happen between 3:15 and 3:30 and already I was setting myself up with the expectation that I'll be lucky to see this go down by 9:30, more like 11 tonight!

Allegedly he's coming straight back with his keys. Let's see, I'll fucking update for good or bad once more stuff happens. 

P.S.- Dboy is supposedly home and not we're just waiting for the fucking keys. Why isn't this kid carrying his own car keys while using his work vehicle?


**Update: 1**
I might be getting some relief. As I predicted correctly, we'll easily be pushing 11PM for the planned dboy pick-up. However, I am not staking all my eggs in one basket. So I contacted the friend who helped me yesterday. I don't feel sick as I thought.. I think the day time anticipation is what was affecting me most. After eating some string beans and having a coffee I feel adequately well. Almost like I feel better than before when I wrote this. I mean like at the time I Was expecting relief at 3:30,then 6:30... then lost hope by 7 of seeing anything before 11. Heck, 11PM may roll around and something else can go wrong like last night.

Of course 45MG of oxy last night was enough to get me to this point. Nonetheless, I asked my friend for one more blue and he said he'd give me 2 to make the tab an even number for my pay day. My plan is to cut a blue in half for tonight and not have more til tomorrow. By the time I have another shift at work, if dboy still doesn't show up.. these blues that I will cut in half will keep me well! 

Is the expectation of relief tonight the reason I'm feeling better? Also, I'd like to help my other friend who is feeling very sick by now but I also don't want to be sick at work a second time this week so I'll likely have to just keep this to myself even if I don't feel entirely right about it. 


**Update 2:**

Still waiting for original order but the friend with the blues did me the favor and I am very grateful. Conservation mode engaged. Just cut one in half and ripped it. Most likely will save the other half for tomorrow. I will certainly thank my yesterday self tomorrow if I do that.

**Update 3:**

So I'm fine for now but I visited my friend who is still waiting. At this point, dboy stopped answering but we have a backup. The backup will be back home ""in the one o'clock hour."" I fucking love when I get an estimate like that. Obviously the one o'clock hour is not 1AM.. but somewhere between 1 and 2 AM and in my experience, any time an ETA is worded in such a way it never transpires in that particular time frame. From there we have a 7AM backup for our backup. I'm not setting high hopes. I'm making sure that I have at least half an oxy 30 available before my shift on Friday so that I'm not holding my breath feeling sick before work on that day.

So the pessimist in me is prepared. The optimist *hopes* that this is solved before 3AM and no later than early afternoon tomorrow.

**Update 3:**

Sunday night, I give my friend $30 bux and he proceeds to go to his dboy later that evening around 11PM. He asked for half a bundle but the dboy gave him 8 bags. I already agreed to split it with my friend because he always promise to pay me back plus some extra for my troubles. So I got 3 bags, he got 5 bags. Monday, dboy suddenly difficult to find. I predicted this because it just seemed too good to be true that dboy would be so generous on Sunday night unless there was a catch. Tuesday, started feeling sick but was loaned 3 oxy's which I proceeded to share with the friend who I was still waiting to get dope through. The next day (Wednesday) was riddled with anxiousness and waiting as stated above this update. I didn't share the two additional oxy's that I was loaned on Wednesday night because I've basically lost faith. I mean just look at update 2. ""The one o'clock hour"", fuck me that came and went and it's now nearly twelve hours later. 

On a positive note, I don't feel shitty, just did a barely noticeable bump and I have a 30 blue left. No matter what happens today, I know for 100% that I will keep at least half of that 30 roxy available for tomorrow afternoon before work. So I'm ready for that worse case scenario where I'm sitting here waiting for the dboy before work.

P.S.- Thanks for the suggestions in the comments. Everyone has been constructive or agreeable.

**Another update:**

Friend shared a small amount before work after I gave him $40 that I got from some work I did. I just had to throw down $40 more dollars that I just earned in order to get someone/anyone else to hustle. My friend got someone to drop off 2 bags before I had work with the promise that they'd have more later this evening. My friend set a clear expectation that the dope would not be here waiting for me after work. So on my way to my friend's house I check the situation; his guy is waiting to pick up.

Further clarification, his guy is waiting for delivery. Luckily it will already be ready once it's dropped off, but wait - there's more! He might not be able to deliver it to us tonight. Something to do with waiting for his wife to sleep being a factor. Good news is that I was given the green light to make my way over to pick it up if it arrives tonight.

I already told my friend, this isn't happening 'til tomorrow but he's trying to hold out optimism. Allegedly it'll be here by 10AM. Not a bad thing to wake up to and since I saw some dope before work, I am hopeful this will pan out.",1495658466.0

If you stayed on the road you were on it would  have taken more $ to get straight or high but you are in more control of your habit and could have taken tolerance breaks while you deal with the mild WD. (Unless you were already past the point of no return)

When you began to shoot you realized your tolerance began to climb much quicker and running out of veins was not an impossible feat. So afterwards, you were forced to use other more dangerous veins to fix. In the end you began spending 3x as much as you ever would have prior and with your now limited options to shoot into, you're panicking as to how you'll stay straight.

When it really gets down to it, becoming addicted is the worst case scenario for drug users. It prevents recreational enjoyment of the drug and forces you to make decisions that ultimately leave you in the same place you were before. IV drug use is in a sense a waste of time and effort past an occasional shot for fun as it destroys any resemblance of practical spending for your drug and TRULY enjoyable use.",1495657697.0

'yeah take the number and call me real quick'. 


'I only got text.'

6dh8ut,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6dh8ut/i_miss_you/,74,https://redd.it/6dh8ut,Derobyl,I miss you.,"I awoke to a knock at my bedroom door. I was unaware of the time, but I knew it was early. Disoriented, I answered the interruption of my dissociation with a disgusted ""what"".

""Mom wants to talk to you.""

Almost immediately after sitting down, I was accosted with the thing I have spent the better part of a year trying to escape: lucidity.

""I'm not fucking going.""

In hindsight, I knew I was lying to myself. Contrary to my arrogance, there was no chance of conquering this demon myself. I sincerely tried. I explained my progress in tapering off. Her attempts were in vain; I could not be persuaded. I would not admit defeat and check myself into rehab.

Without warning, yet with impeccable timing, my closest friends walked into what I now realized was an intervention. Overwhelmed with shame and disbelief, I hung my head. 

""We love you...""

Not the most eloquent of poets can portray the tears that stream the face of a loved one who truly fears your approaching demise. 

In silence I watched as another entered the room. An old bridge I had burned. Burned far, far beyond repair. Our relationship was so estranged that their presence alone convinced me to go.

I sat in my room with this individual and one of the others while the more naive waited with my mother. We fought back tears while discussing my spiral. Hesitantly, I answered truthfully when they asked if I had any on me. I told them I had a couple bags left from the bundle I bought the night before.

""If you're gonna shoot them... just do it now.""

In one moment, the innocence and ignorance of our lives died. We were no longer bewildered by the world around us. No longer excited by what the future may hold. No longer experimenting with experience. We had run amuck through our entire lives together and learned everything our way: the hard way. We struggled to understand life, and the idea of growing up was terrifying. Deflecting the realities of adulthood was a skill we had mastered. We could not run forever, though, and our coming of age arrived in the form of intravenous heroin.

I remember how strung out and afraid I was after I said my goodbyes and meandered into where I would spend my next four weeks. I survived the detox, started going to the meetings, and made some friends I will never forget. Regardless of how open I was and how hard I tried, I could not handle this normal state of being.

*What's the best part of being sober? You get your feelings back. What's the worst part of being sober? You get your feelings back.*

I had been running from my demons for so long that I forgot how scary they really are. I fucked up so much in the last year... Most of all, I fucked you up.

I understand that I am an adult. I make my own decisions, and I alone am responsible for my actions. However, it is much easier to point your finger.

You let the dope into our lives.

You said ""I truly thought I loved you"".

You broke my heart. 

You ruined my fucking life. 

You were the reason I stuck a needle in my arm. 

Obviously I could never actually blame you for the path I traveled, and I will never hate you for your own pusuit of happiness. One tends to linger within the nostalgia of the good times when found in times of trouble. It is human nature to attempt to soothe distress.

I was in a parking lot with a bundle of dope and a box of rigs before I even unpacked. 

I could not handle the re-emergence of all those feelings. The only coping mechanism I had was abolishing all feelings. The only feeling I ever wanted was the absence thereof. 

There is no euphoria stronger, nor a bliss more pure than the absolute apathy produced by intravenous heroin. There is no sensation in the world, be it physical, emotional, or spiritual, that is even remotely anagolous. Humans simply are not meant to experience such a high. That extraordinary feeling is unforgettable, and the empirical knowledge of its existence will forever be an albatross around one's neck.

I have not spoken to you in a year.

I have not shot heroin in six months.

The longing slowly fades, but I know it will never extinguish.",1495808519.0

Everyone has heard the media blabbing endlessly about the opioid epidemic. I want to show it from a different angle. Not ""what can we do to solve this,"" or ""what caused this?"" But just a window into everyday life for someone (anonymous of course) who likes to use opiates.

The issue is finding that person. I know everyone hates and doesn't trust the media.

Myne would be.. 1.BJ Penn (back in the day, when he would lick blood off his fuckin gloves - straight savage before Frankie took his soul) 2.  Matt Hughes (use to be a straght monster) and 3. Rory Mcdonald (just a technical fucking machine)

I realized in writing this I have way to many.. and these top 3 might not even be my final top 3.. besides BJ for sure. Jorge Masvidal lately has really been growin' on me - hell of a striker and great defensive grappling. Robbie Lawler is a beast too has so much fuckin' heart. Only drag on him his he gets into straight brawls and makes his fights much closer then they should be. Of course Anderson Silva in his prime is/was the GOAT of MMA period.. he's clearly lost a step or 2 in past few years and his reflexes are goin..but he is STILL fighting the elite of the elite even 40+ yrs old after the worst leg break in sports history (atleast mma).

Lookin' forward to seein Holloway vs Aldo real bad. Holloway is one of my top 10 favorite fighters as well. You can't fuck with that hawaiian pride baby. Hilo all day. Fights this year have not been as big name but still been some great fights. Garbrant vs Dillashaw was going to be amazing - but i guess the stem cells for cody's back didn't get him healed in time so that fights off which kinda sucks. This season of Ultimate fighter has been pretty good.. cody comes off as a real moron tho - tries to solve EVERYTHING with violence lol. He is a hell of a fighter tho, his footwork is nasty.

So 4 years ago my husband and I start going to pain management.  He has several issues with his back and I have several issues with my neck, back, and fibro.  So we both end up being prescribed hydrocodone.  All was well in the world!

Fast forward to a year and a half ago...we both had some issues taking our meds as prescribed over the past few years but we managed to keep it in check for the most part or so I thought.  I walked in on my husband one day snorting his pills off the back of the toilet.  Come to find out he had been doing from the beginning.  Then my pills start disappearing.  A few here and a few there, just enough for me to think we'll maybe I took them and didn't remember.  Over the months things keep getting worse.  I would hide them he would find them and take them.  I would lock them up in a safe he would figure out the code or get the key.  Never once did he tell me upfront and he would lie to me about stealing them.  One time I had just gotten my perscription and I was 14 pills short and he blamed it on the pharmacy that they miss counted.  He would also steal from my dad.  He had diladid from his back surgery so he would go visit while they were at work and take them.

It had gotten to the point were he was taking all of his and half of mine in a two week period.  I had a hysterectomy and after the surgery I come home with a script of oxy so after taking that for 3 days which was all the dr gave me I go to get my Norco and they are all gone which left me recovering from surgery and in withdrawal. I had elbow surgery as well and he did it again.  It was not a fun ride!

Fast forward to December of last year, after all the fussing, fighting, crying, and threats of divorce he discovers the DNM.  The answer to his problems.  He would just order when he ran out.  Well that got expensive spending hundreds a month on pills.  He was laid off from his job in February so we didn't have the money coming in like we used to so he decided switch to fent it's cheaper and don't have to use as much.  

We all know how that turns out!  His habit sky rocketed and was sick every two hours if he didn't redose.  It had gotten to the point were he never got out of bed and depression kicked in.  He had checked out of life and started having other health problems. 

About a month ago he ran out and his shipment was delayed for a few days and he finally got to feel the full affects of withdrawal from fent.  It wasn't pretty!  He was wishing for death.  Since he doesn't have a job we were running out of money so he found himself getting sick more and more so he said he was done and that he was gonna taper off.  Well that didn't work because we all know that's something you can't do when you habit is that big with no will power.  

He had gotten to the point he was so depressed and tired of being sick he wanted to die.  I was worried that I would come home one day and find him dead.  He always managed to be sick a few days at a time but this time his order came in and it was bunk and no money to buy more.  After 3 days of withdrawal he couldn't take it anymore and he asked for help so I  called every outpatient rehab and sub dr around and no one could get him in.  No one could see him for weeks.  We finally decided to go to a regular dr and get him all the comfort meds to try to make it easier but with the fent habit nothing help.  The dr he saw did sypothize with him and called and pulled some strings and was able to get him in two days ago for a sub induction.  Within these two days he is a different person. It feels like I have my husband back!  Subs are a miracle!

During this time I had developed a bigger habit as well with pills taking more just to be numb to him and what he was doing.  I would find myself running out before refill day being sick using krantom or whatever he had to try to stay well until my next refill.  I felt like in the middle of dealing with him I had stepped into a hole myself.  So I decided if he was getting help I needed to be clean for him so he doesn't have the temptation around so I am working with my dr tomorrow  to start weining myself off as well.  Next comes our relationship and working on getting back to who we were and putting all this in the past.  Let's hope it all works out!!

Again sorry for the long post.  I am not able to tell anyone, friends or family and I needed to share.  It feels like I have hope again!",1495792336.0

It's a trip how so many aspects of life are similar to one another. (Note: It's not an entirely new idea, but I feel like I took it a little further). 

Anyways, here goes: opiates are like loans, right? You're borrowing future doses of dopamine, and when you come down, you have to pay those neurotransmitters back; hence, you feel shitty relative to baseline. But the loan has interest, right? It's worse than a zero-sum transaction. If you plotted your feelings on a graph, the integral would be negative overall (the area under the positive portion of the feeling function is less than the area under the negative portion). This is the part where I took the analogy even further. Not only are opiates like loans, the nature of an opiate addiction is like going further and further into debt. At first, when you take out a loan, it's a conventional one, such as a car or house loan. You're only paying like 4-7 points on your principal. But if you decide to keep abusing opiates, you keep getting advances on future money (i.e. positive, pleasurable feelings). So to pay back your conventional loan and continue spending more money than you've actually earned, you sign up for a credit card. So now you're paying like a 35% APR. Ouch! But fuck facing the music, buckling down, living frugally, and paying your debts, right? I want to keep spending money I don't have. How can I pay for my conventional loan, my CC, and all the extra shit that makes me feel good, but that I don't have the money for? Payday loan, nigga! So now, I'm paying 2,000% on this fucking payday loan.

I left the city to explore the countryside for a few days (fucking beautiful landscapes) and returned to the city to get my flight home.

Although I had a contact to score, I decided to cold cop in a vietnamese neighbourhood away from all the tourists and scam artists. Took me a couple of hours of walking around and visiting a few bars, but I finally met a guy. I asked his friend first, but he exploded in laughter and handed me over to his friend. Had to communicate with only hand gestures cus there was no English whatsoever. The 'slapping one hand on the crook of your arm' seemed to be the one which yielded the most success. After showing him how much I was willing to spend I hopped on his bike and he proceeded to take me on a smack tour of his city.

We hit up dealers houses, pharmacies to get works, and borderline disgusting toilets which were apparently the ""safe"" places to shoot. After repeating this process 4 times, and being fairly high (I still had Bupe in my system from the day before), he takes us out of town to get a better deal. It's a half hour ride and we're both flying down the highway on his motorbike eating watermelon purchased from the side of the road.

He's incredibly paranoid of cops and keeps pocketing the dope in his mouth and spitting it out, even when I cannot see a cop in sight. We pull over to the side of the highway in the middle of nowhere to do a shot in the bushes. When he's loading up my rig the barrel cracks and dope water spills everywhere. He loses his shit and is genuinely pissed off that we lost a shot..He gives me his share which i found really nice.

I got another point to take home and shoot up in the comfort of my own hostel. There's a Korean dude sleeping right next to me in the dorm but I do my shot in peace..It was bliss. 

I felt pretty satisfied after that little adventure..but it turned out that the night was just beginning. Met a cool group of other backpackers and ended up going to a Boiler Room gig (Egyptian Lover fucken slayed it) and a couple of clubs. I even got laid! She was a cute Asian American girl.

I was so tempted to ask them why they were not only listening to it but blasting it to the point of that the speakers were about to blow.
Maybe it's something only I would find funny. But god damn did I chuckle. It was close to being the last song you'd expect in that situation.

as I roll over to stop the horrible pounding and screeching coming out of my alarm clock.  

I try to keep that one fucking beam of sunlight out of my eyes to no avail.   It stabs into my brain like an ice pick.  I hit the button and the music blessedly stops.  

I sit up and regret it immediately as some small creature in my stomach does back flips.  

I open my phone just to check what day it is.  Upon discovering I don't have to be at work, I wonder what asshole set the alarm..  Then I remember I live alone with 4 cats, must have been one of the cats.  ""Those furry little fuckers"", I mutter under my breath as I stumble, eyes squinted to the bathroom.  

After giving birth to some sort of fire demon, I shuffle into the kitchen to make breakfast and coffee.   

I stare into the fridge for about 10 minutes before settling on a Monte Chisto sandwich.   

I beat the eggs, dip the sourdough rolls in them and fry them in copious amounts of butter.   

Bacon slow cooks on the back burner, occasionally spitting and burning my arms and bare chest.   I stop for a second to ponder how many grease burns it'll take before I stop cooking bacon shirtless. 

The french toast rolls, eggs, and bacon all finish cooking at the same time.  

A small victory, but I take what I can get these days.   

I decide to add some pastrami and cheddar to my sandwich.    

My hands tremble as I wash breakfast down with my second cup of coffee.  

""fuck me, now what do I do?""  I think to myself as I wash the dishes.  

I sit on my couch, wishing my head would stop pounding.  
 
I tell myself the headache is why I don't feel like going anywhere or setting up my workshop.   Unfortunately, I've known myself for long enough to know I'm a lair.   

The anhedonia that hit when I stopped taking methadone has sucked all motivation out of me.  When I do convince myself to do something, I feel like I'm watching someone else do it through a foggy lens. 

""how much longer is this going to last?"" I ask myself at least 20 times a day. 

I spend all together too long thinking about going next door to cop something, or digging out the full stash box I didn't have the heart to throw away.   

After which, I spend even longer mentally beating myself up over even entertaining the idea.  

At some point in all this thinking and wondering I started some much needed cleaning, I don't remember starting.  I don't even realize how much I've done, 'till I walk in after taking out the trash and do a double take.  ""huh, did I do that?"" I mutter to myself.  

I plop down on my now clean couch and turn my computer on.  ""hey its 5 o'clock!""  I tell one of my cats excitedly as he sleeps curled up next to me.  ""beer time!""

I scamper off to the kitchen to grab a beer and a snack.  I sit back down and try to decide between music, a book or a movie.    As my cat crawls onto my lap I decide on an audiobook.  I open my beer and we both settle in for another evening.

Add in some work days, wash, rinse, repeat..   ad infinitum...  

I wanted to write something post using days.  So here it is.   

To those that will say my story is pointless and wasted their time, I give zero fucks that you don't get it.   This isn't some tidy little morality tale, this is a snapshot of life and addiction.

From the basic gist of things, it appears that oral has a higher bio-availability than nasal. However, not necessarily every time. For example I've seen ranges for percentages of each ROA. 

For oral at it's lowest percent, it comes close to insufflated/nasal at it's higher percentage. Some stats show overlap. Nothing I've read is confirmed but I've seen **60%-87% for oral** and **40% to 50%** insufflated/snorted. Of course it should be noted that you will feel the effects sooner when snorting but it doesn't necessarily mean you get ""higher"". Since some of it ends up getting swallowed in a drip it's not unreasonable expect it to last nearly as long as oral.

I am saving half a roxy (blue 30 mg) for work tomorrow. It's a healthy half, in that there's a little more than 50% of a pill since I only consumed the smaller half today.

**The question:**

**Am I better off eating this pill before work tomorrow instead of snorting it?** I'm not worried about getting high or enjoying it as much as I am in not feeling sick. 

So far consuming half an oxy has proven to shake away symptoms and has lasted through morning.

__________________________
Update
__________________________

**Day 2:** Half a blue still remains. Last night a little after midnight I was getting some yawns but after eating I was able to get a good night's sleep. I was given some weed until pay day which I will keep handy for late night bowls or joints. It'll come in handy as I doubt that I will be getting any dope until tuesday. I'd like to be wrong but my foreshadowing abilities have been on point all week once I started losing hope for dope and faith in the supply chain. 

Anyway, regarding **day 2**. Woke up as unmotivated as ever when there is no expectation of scoring opiates but nothing worse than some abdominal sensations. First bowl movement mostly solid followed by a hearty breakfast. Three eggs and  three long strips of bacon. Even when I have plenty of dope, this is the type of breakfast I eat before ripping my first line of the day. So at some point before I leave for work, I shall eat a quarter of a blue. From there, I will have one quarter remaining and I will likely stick that in my travel bag to be consumed as late as possible. Maybe I'll save my energy drink as a mid-shift pick-me-up.

**An hour after my roughly quarter pill and first dose of the day**

I feel good, in that I don't feel sick. I'm confident that I'll be able to make it to work without any major pain or loathing. Not like the last time I went to work and felt like total shit. I saved the larger half of that half pill which is now roughly a quarter pill. If I'm lucky, maybe I can save it for tomorrow. When I did cut it in half, there was a tiny bump of material that I did snort. So most of it was orally consumed and a much tinier portion snorted. 

**I'm really grateful for the feedback given by the respondents in the comments and I hope this post serves to add to the ever expanding data bank of knowledge experience that other opiate users may find useful.** I plan to keep posting updates to this post so that others will be able read what they *may* expect during an opiate taper and cessation.


**Day 3:** 

I'm doing okay but still wish I saved that last quarter of a pill from yesterday for today. I'm waiting for a drop off that is allegedly supposed to occur this afternoon. It was supposed to occur in the AM so of course I'm disappointed. If this doesn't show by 5PM I'm gonna see if I can get my money back from my friend. I didn't bring that up yet because he might scurry and stop responding to messages if backed into a corner. 

Either way I'm satisfied with eating it versus snorting it for the purpose of avoiding sickness. It is true that it takes a ridiculously small amount to get well without getting high. I was quite ecstatic going into work yesterday, very satisfied about not feeling sick. Many hours later, I was anxious about scoring that night .. which I knew was not guaranteed. Even the expectation set for morning was not guaranteed but I tried to have faith since luck was pretty good before work. 

Nearly 2PM.... let's see if this dope appears before 5.",1495741931.0

I just recently got some H and am wondering, cause it's happened before when I've grabbed, If I make a shot too small and weak, can I just re dose a bit more right away to get me where I want to be? Or will it be a waste like if I were using dilaudid?

I'd appreciate quick responses as I'm currently facing this conundrum. Thanks :)

They literally had no pain relief after a while and I had to take them just to be well, in the end I told my doc I wanted to come off them so weaned down and eventually stopped, the first 5 days were a killer, nausea, the usual opiate WD symptoms as well as the anti-depressant style WD's so I felt rotten, especially having to put my dog to sleep while WD'ing, awful times.

What's peoples thoughts on it, I know it's not a true opiate but in my opinion its a horrible, nasty drug!

Oh and don't try to smoke your meth boogers, they're nasty.

No clue what the deal with that paticular batch of meth but something wasn't right. Alright so I had been on one going 5 days and finally crashed last night, back to normal now. On day 3 1/2 my buddy picked up a half g, he said chick was spun like no other so i assume that there was finally some half ass decent clear. 


He gets back to the house, breaks it out and at first look it isn't that bad looking or all that much like shaz. The smell was off though. Mix me up a shot of maybe .1 or .2 since there's 3 heads and they're smoking. Now, i have not had anything of any quality since moving here. Been doing half g shots without getting all that lit, hadn't touched it for 2ish years and only been messing with it again for a couple weeks. 


Have a little trouble registering at first but get it all in. This is where it goes weird on me. Got just a faint burning in my throat. But it did not feel right, different from back home and getting decent quality. 


My vision starts going a dehydrated piss color and it is impossible to focus on anything. Can't even attempt to get up from my little spot in the bathroom. Lay down and a few minutes later my buddy checks up on me so i decide i have to go back in there. Can't see, can't walk, throw my gear down and just curl up. Not feeling scared or anything just off.


All that lasts maybe an hour and a half or two and I'm nearly back to where i was before that shot. Sure I'm spun but i was beforehand. Get my composure somewhat back and try to chill. 5 hours or so later my back starts hurting and slowly builds and spreads. Completely useless at this point cant do a damn thing. I let chick know something was off and what happened. Only answer i got was her laughing. 


Ok so now it is yesterday evening. Eyes are heavy, starting to see some shadows, no big deal. Pick up my buddy from work and head on down to someone's place, they just got a ball from someone else. I've had so much trouble not falling asleep and being in a crazy amount of pain. Get there and between 4 heads we go through ~2 g's. Everyone is geeking hard, then there's me dozing off. Tell my buddy hey lets get moving.


We get home, twist another bowl, say fuck this Im going to sleep. I go find the benadryl, pour some out and the fuckers turn into roaches and run away. Catch 2 of the fuckers finally then struggle to smoke a bowl of some bud. At this point i am completely gone. Nothing makes sense, nothing looks real, bed time. Head hits the pillow and that's it, no mas.

*I didnt get a sponsor

*I got bored. Mostly just watched TV if I didnt work.

Yesterday AM I took about 8 percs (10/325) at about 10:30am. No drinking all day.

At 7:30ish I took 3 more for a monster headache, same pills. I always Try to CWE but I had nothing I could do it with. No filters or anything. (So like 3600mg of Tylenol)

Now the dumb part. Went out drinking last night at around 8:30. Drank 4 or 5 light beers and a shot. 

I'm a frequent poster here and known, but super embarrassed about this one.

I'm laying here, pretty sure I fucked my liver up.  Online and google would have me believing I should go to a hospital. I also took a bunch of percs 3 days ago if it matters.

I have no idea how it works. I thought I was good based on half life of Tylenol, but not sure if that's accurate with alcohol. I haven't been drinking a ton, used to though. And I took about 1g apap before going out.

I know it's a lot to read through, but y'all are some of the only peeps I can rely on, mad fuckin scientists on here. Nauseous today, dizzy. Not hangoverish

I have left the dope game and been sober for around 2 months now and don't miss heroin or meth (only used when I had H) one bit... I have been on suboxone since my relapse though and it has helped me soo much!  I replaced heroin use with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and slowly adding a weight lifting routine that will benefit my grappling greatly.  I still talk to some dope users but I have dropped most of them from my life when I chose to get clean.

Who else is either on suboxone or completely clean from everything and enjoying life too? Do you miss the drugs? Still dealing with cravings or no? Finally have you replaced the negative addictions with positive ones?

I always go through a specific friend. This week has been a rough week for both of us to procure. 

At this point, if I don't see dope by 5PM... my faith is lost. I already told him that I want my money back if it doesn't show by 9PM so that I can take the situation into my own hands. At that point the relief will come in the form of perc 10's but it will have to suffice. 

Alternatively I was thinking about making PST. 

Either way, when pay day rolls around I'm buying a fuck ton of poppy seeds, some kratom and some dope. Maybe subs too. 

Truth be told, if I didn't find intermittent relief while waiting all week I'd probably already be done with the symptoms. I keep resetting the withdrawals the way things have been going.

I gave my friend $40 bux yesterday telling him that I don't want to be throwing my money into the wind. He promised me that if dope didn't show that night, that he'd pay me back that night. Then he claims that his friend dropped off 2 bags before work so he shared some with me. He said that his friend would be getting dope that evening after work and that he would possibly bring it to us. Then it changed to having to pick it up if he didn't get it too too late.

My friend claims that his guy said he'd be here in the afternoon. By my definition afternoon ends at 5PM so he has to show up before 5. If he doesn't, as I already stated, my faith will be lost. At that point waiting to get my money at 9PM will be a courtesy.

After that if my friend stalls to give me my money, or has a story then I'll know I was fucking screwed and used. I'm holding out hope because of the dope that appeared from the sky before work yesterday but then again that's why I suspect something. Maybe my friend bought half a bun, used the majority of it to get out of WD and stay well and gave me a minimal morsel. Of course I could just be paranoid.. we'll see.

Wish me luck.. I'll let everyone know later if I got screwed or if I successfully get what I've been waiting on.

**Update:**

Fuck, fuck, fuck! I posted four hours ago.. it's nearly 8PM now and I'm just gonna text my friend and give him a chance to level with me. Then I can move on from waiting.

**Update 2:**

I offered my friend an out and told him that I can empathize with how he's feeling. There was a time where it would have been impossible to understand what an addict goes through when they're in between doses. 

So he admitted to nothing and insisted that we would have dope or my money by end of tonight. By 11PM he'll either be on his way to get or claiming that his ride is not answering. If the ride does not answer, then it's definitely a no-go. **He did invite me over to share pizza that he heated up in the mean time...**

**Update 3:**

He claims to have sent a ""wtf"" message to his friend and is sticking to the original narrative. The story goes that the friend who got the H for us is having a hard time sneaking away from his wife to deliver to us. Maybe it's true? We'll see if something pans out tonight. It is just beyond 10:30 PM.

###**Update 4 - Late Night Edition:**

&nbsp;

The refrigerator hums along accompanied by a light chug as  the glossy black microwave oven's display indicates that it is 2:38 AM, the thermometer-clock on the table says 2:48 and the cordless phone ""Fully charged"". I mean, yeah of course the cordless phone says other stuff on it's display but I can't see the time to see if it's out of sync. The microwave is closer to accurate as my cell phone anyway. Not feeling great but I've felt shittier. Looking forward to taking on tomorrow after a decent night's sleep. 

&nbsp;

Before I sleep, I will kill some time at this keyboard. Sure, I could just do that in a locally stored document (of course it would probably get clouded somewhere, pun intended) but I'd never read it again it would only be relevant right here. Tomorrow, I'll eat a big health breakfast unlike today where I only ate bacon. Then a muffin for lunch. Then Pizza. Well, that was first dinner. I had leftovers 30 minutes ago. The point I'm getting at is tomorrow should better than today and frankly I was probably fit enough to exercise today anyway. Tomorrow I will have to, provided that something unanticipated does not make that impossible. I could do bike miles, but I have a funny feeling about a component that I should service first. Ab crunches and push-ups. The push-ups challenge me more than chin-ups and pull-ups but pull-ups are more taxing on back muscles. It would probably behoove me not to stir up anything until I'm certain symptoms are gone.


&nbsp;

Maybe I won't wake up with soaked tee shirt. Boy, it's true what they say about clean linen. Well, I dunno. Saw a WikiHow article that insisted on that aspect of weathering WD symptoms. I find having at least one spare undershirt, or other tee-shirt by my bed side comes in handy. It's nice to be able to pull off a soaked shirt at 7 AM, put a dry one on, roll-over and go back sleep. I'm not wearing my pajama bottoms tonight. Those poor things get soaked in sweat anyway and then the tissues in my pockets end up smelling like sweat when I go to use them to blow nose dope-free nose. Certainly not by choice but not necessarily the worst thing that can be happening right now.

&nbsp;

Expectations are set for the next two days. Hell, following the theme here I'm sure any reader can guess how this will go. Of course if the unexpected happens, I will be right here to share that with great excitement.

From what i've been able to find on google, i have learned that they are semi-synthetic opioids. Now, i have taken dilaudid a few times. Had a bottle of 2mg pills. Took them orally, 2 or 3 pills at a time, and chewed them. As i do not insufflate or inject any drug (personal choice, no judgement to anyone who does).  I found the hydromorphone to be fairly weak this way. Yes, i am aware of the low oral bioavailability of both hydromorphone and oxymorphone.  I've never taken oxymorphone.  So my question is this: why is the oral bioavailability of these two drugs so low? Using Opana ER as an example, does it have to do with the chemical makeup of the drug? Ingredients like TIMERx and xanthan gum? I cant really seem to find information on why the oral BA is so low. 

Tl;dr

I find it odd that oxycodone has an oral BA around 90 percent and oxymorphone (which is supposed to be stronger) is around 10 percent. Anyone have any answers? Or can anyone point me to some reading material with answera?

ok guys just got these, looking for suggestions off amount to take, i know it's a stupidly difficult answer to ask as there are so many variables height/weight/tolerance to name but 3, 

so i have recently stopped taking smack and got myself on a maintenance methadone script(55mg)and diazepam(20mg) maintenance script, so I've already got gear in me, also I've only not had smack for 7 days so likely have a bit of a tolerance with that, 

I have also emptied 7 of the 10's and swallowed them about an hour ago and am getting a wee buzz, but nothing to write home about, i dunno if this is cos the methadone has saturated my mu receptors and spoiling the hit or 70mg aint enough,

what mg of oxy would generally be required by a .4 per day smack head in order to get a decent nod going?
or should i just 'feel' my way? also I'm desp to try IV these, so does anyone have 2p worth to say about mg amount and type that are easiest to IV?

hope this makes sense 
peace out

I guess my troubles really started about a week ago with Xanax. My boy(boss) has a script for Xanax and adderal, I love Xanax but I hate how it makes me not give a shit about anything. Well I ate a couple bars, then a couple more then it was three days later and I have been fucking hot mess. Then came Friday night,I called a cab from the train and dboy I have never met hops in and says he's got that boy. Well I ask for a sample which he provides. I'm sure you guys know how this story ends. Well now I've been getting High for three days. Today I didn't do anything except a 1/4 of subutex. It wasn't as fun this time, maybe because of the risk that is now involved. I'm on parole and I live in a sober house. I'm making a commitment to myself, that I am not going to call the dboy today. A little background on myself is that I started on oxy80s in 09. And basically got strung out on heroin from there, I have been an iv drug user almost the entire past 7 years. Where does the time go, sometimes I ask myself how I got this fucked up and in so in over my head. I don't want to be on maintenance anymore, but without subs i have no embers to do anything no desire to live life to the fullest. I work as an over the phone finance broker, I live off commission and I love what I do but it requires a certain amount of energy that make opiate use ideal. Lately I have been feeling so much better about myself and my chance for success, however I always seem to revert back to that dog food for basically no reason other than I need to that chemical sensational burst through my brain.

I lurk here lots and I think I'm going to start posting regularly because I post a lot on other subs on my main account and have some stories I could share with ya'll that you would probably get a kick out of, and add to some of the conversations you have going on.

&nbsp;A little background on my habit because it seems like ya'll like content:

&nbsp;
My old lady has had it with my drug problem, we live in different cities so she's basically been sticking her head in the sand because I look like a fucking corpse but she never confronted me until recently. The last time she came to visit I really upset her because she thought I was finally clean but I was in the middle of another detox and didn't want to be a bag of shit when she was here so I relapsed (for I would wager the 15th time or so in my life hahahah) and busted me. We are moving in together soon and I've been stringing together a few weeks of clean time here and there but I've been a daily user for couple of years, basically the whole time we've been together. I've had quite a bit of clean time the last few months because I'm trying to quit, but I keep fucking up and work full time so end up sucked back in. My long-term plan currently is kratom maintenance, and if I don't have this shit under control by the time she moves in I'm taking the plunge and going on suboxone.

&nbsp;
I'm 2 weeks deep on a binge and I am going on a 3 days camping trip with her and do not want to be strung out on heroin for the camping trip, or visibly withdrawing and embarrass her in front of her friends.

&nbsp;
My preferred ROA is smoking it. I get pretty good west coast #3 powder. I think its #3 powder? Smells a bit vinegary, brown, you can snort or shoot it too but 99.9% of the time I smoke it, and have never shot it. My only friend I know who does H as well, smokes this gear and other people's gear, some of which tested as 100% fent,  and in his opinion there is little to no fent in the shit I always get, but 80% of the shit tested around here tests positive for fent and I feel like that's a lowball estimate so this might be bumped up with a little fent but probably not a lot. Anyways, here are my questions:

&nbsp;
1. I have never taken lope as a way to ease withdrawal symptoms, but intend to bring some, if anything in case I get the shits. I intend to drink while camping, but not binge drink. Is there problems mixing *a few beers with high dosages of lope?

&nbsp;
2. Is there anything they mix over-the-counter lope products with in Canada that I should watch out for? 

&nbsp;
3. Are there problems with mixing lope and kratom as a way to ease withdrawal symptoms?

&nbsp;
4. I'm going to bring some H just in case I'm falling apart out there. Is there issues with doing a little bit of H on high dosages of lope?

&nbsp;
5. Are there any other over the counter medications I can get in Canada that will help with this shit?

&nbsp;
6. I'm going to try and cold-cop some benzos for the trip too. Any problems with piling some ativan/loraz/clonaz on top of lope/kratom?

&nbsp;Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide me regarding the above questions, I really appreciate it!

&nbsp;*EDIT: I realise a 6 pack of beer is probably an over-estimate on how much beer I'll be able to handle, especially while on kratom. I have taken kratom and drank on many occasions before my H habit, and know I won't be able to handle more than 2-3 beers if I'm on high dosages of kratom so I'll probably just be sticking to weed and nursing a few beers over the day.

- Unless a cop has you dead-to-rights on a crime, you do not have to identify yourself. If you don't feel like ID'ing, don't. They will get upset, I promise. You will hear things such as ""I'm just doing my job"" ""Do you have something to hide is that why?"" These are all very common statements and the best response is to just say nothing which brings me to my next point...

- Say nothing! Well, not nothing, but here's a list of things I will say to police;
""Am I free to go?""
""Are you detaining me?""
""What crime am I being held/charged for/with?""

Other then that, the best thing to do is ALWAYS say NOTHING. They will ask you questions that seem harmless, but trust me, you don't even know man, cops can twist some shit up and get you with some jedi shit, your best bet is to just say nothing. 

- Every situation is different, you kinda gotta feel out the cop. Most in my area are fine, in fact I usually do ID just because it's quicker but sometimes I don't feel like it, or feel like I'm being profiled for being homeless, then I'm liable to mouth off. Usually though, my go-to is this

*cop walks up*

*I click my app on my cell phone that instantly starts recording*

""Hey sir, just so you're aware I'm recording audio/video""

*cop asks me a question*

""I'm sorry I'm not able to answer any questions without a lawyer present*

*cop explodes with frustration realizing he can't shitstomp my basic rights and leaves*

- If you're a passenger in a car, you don't have to ID, unless it's a felony stop. In fact, you can get out and walk away (but I would suggest sitting tight, and refusing to ID if you need too)

- SUSPICION IS NOT PROBABLE CAUSE
- SUSPICION IS NOT PROBABLE CAUSE

Hey guys guess what SUSPICION. IS. NOT. PROBABLE. CAUSE.
No, seriously, I hate this one. An officer can get fucked on his suspicions, him being suspicious you're up to some shady shit does not give him the right to
A. ID you
B. Hold you until a dog arrives

Oh yeah, basic traffic stop law, a cop doing a traffic stop does not have the right to hold you until a K9 unit arrives. Why? That would mean he is detaining you, which he can't do, because he doesn't have cause.....which is why he needs the K9.....get it? All you gotta do is ask ""Am I free to go?"" and he has to let you or tell you why he's detaining you. A traffic infraction is not enough. Ask for your citation and be on your merry way. The actual law states the officer has the time it would take for a presumed average traffic stop w/ citation issue to get a dog there, otherwise you're being held against your will. Now, it's important to ask to go, he won't remind you you're allowed to leave you know? Make it clear that he is not allowing you to leave based on nothing.

- Cops are jerks. Yup, suprise suprise. Cops suck. They will make you feel like an asshole. They're bullies, and guess what? It's totally okay to feel the way you feel. It's okay if you feel scared, dumb, embarassed. It's okay that you're shaking to the core (and they loooooove to point that out) being scared/nervous/shaking is a 100% normal response and don't let him make you feel bad about it. 

- If you're being trespassed from somewhere, all a cop can do is make you leave. Like for example, one time I fell asleep in my car outside a Dairy Queen and they called the cops on me and trespassed me, it was dumb. The DQ people told the cops my car had been staying there for a year and had needles everywhere (guess what, they lied) and the cops wanted to search me. Nope, not happening, and they weren't able too. 




 So anyways, yeah, I'm gonna add more to this I swear, sorry about rambling but yeah fuck you let's see you do a guide jk I'm sorry I get heated thinking about cops. Stop being sheeplepeople, and stop ID'ing yourselves if ya got warrants lol.

Oh yeah also suspicion is not probable cause, forgot to mention that.




UPDATE: Sorry guys I promise I'll get to all questions and comments soon it's been a crazy morning in the game, talk soon!


UPDATE 2: Turns out I'm a drug addict and don't feel like doing stuff sometimes, if you have a direct question you want answered, make sure the information isn't available on Google first, and then feel free to shoot me a PM!

(Script or No Script),"So I'm going to ask this question in two parts. First part is using Narcan auto-injector that was prescribed to ME for free. The second portion of the question will also be using Narcan auto-injector BUT it will be one given to me by, lets say, a doctor. (All my Narcan is prescribed so the unprescribed one is a full blown hypothetical)

Question Part I: 
Let's say that I am walking down the street one day with my PRESCRIBED Narcan auto-injector in my pocket. While walking I see someone OD'ing. I go and use the Narcan and save his/her life. Now here's the tricky part. After all this happened he/she has a BAD allergic reaction to the meds and has to be hospitalized for a while due to it. Can he sue me and actually have a chance of making me broke because of that; even though I used it to save his life with no knowledge that he was basically deathly/seriously allergic to the medication? (Remember the Narcan is prescribed to me so I am technically ""trained"" in it's use).

Question Part II: 
Let's say the above happened again BUT the Narcan wasn't explicitly prescribed to me, only given to me by a doctor or someone. Does that change the situation legally in any way?

Thanks for those who take time out to read and answer my question. Trying to figure out if it's worth me walking around with the Narcan or not and just call 911 instead of both and let them deal with it.

3.health risks from a poor diet.

Without going to the store and buying products or knowing someone in the optometry field that has tools to dilate pupils there is no way to hide your constricted (pinned) pupils.

 Especially if your looking for something you could do around your house or quickly before say you go to work or school your out of luck. I searched for hours online and the only advice was to take 5-htp pills, or other various drugs that would defeat the purpose of trying to hide your pinned eyes.

 Basically unless you know a professional optometrist or can get the right pills from a pharmacy you cant hide pinned pupils at all no matter what you do.  

If you are trying to find a way to enlarge/dilate your pupils and you ask around online or make a post people might say your paranoid, thinking to much but those people dont know what theyre talking about and either dont have to worry about hiding pinned eyes or dont care. Plenty of people have light colored eyes and when someone is high thats one of the first giveaways. Before i did any opiates at all if i ran into a friend or someone i knew that was high that was the first thing i would see and notice if they were high. Their pinned eyes was a dead giveaway. After researching i realized there js no quick or easy way to counter act and dilate your pupils to cover pinned eyes, that is if there is any other ways to dilate your pupils while high on opiates.

They're also pretty green and soft, but the petals have fallen off within the last few days (week) and I'm wondering if it's too early to make tea with them.

Mostly wondering if I'm gonna end up having a seizure or sick as a dog. I figure y'all are the ones to ask. Also, what are the risks with this? I'm pretty sure these are papaver somniferum, but may be papaver orientales. So what happens if they're orientales?

I took amazing care of them, watering them daily and checking up on them to make sure they were getting enough light, etc.  But the first batch never grew.  Not even a sprout.

So I decided to try harder by plowing up the earth and planting even MORE seeds in a better spot this time.  (You're supposed to plant them right on top of the dirt without covering them because they need direct light to sprout).  Everything was cool the first day.  On the second day, it looked like bugs were having a party in my seed patch.  There were pill bugs, earthworms and tons of ANTS that I'd never seen there before.  ""Oh well,"" I thought.  ""They must like the freshly-plowed dirt.""  I'd heard that slugs would eat poppy seeds, but had no concern about other pests at this early stage.

Next day I return to water them and cannot find even a single seed remaining.  I keep watering the barren dirt daily anyway, hoping to get a sprout despite knowing it's not gonna happen.  Then I Googled ""what bugs eat poppy seeds?"" and saw reports of fucking *ants* carrying them off and eating them!  Several people have said the same thing.  Now that I think about it, those ants were only there one day and never returned.  They must've been feasting on my seeds.  Bastards!

Just needed to vent about this not very problematic problem.  lol.  It's kinda funny when you think about it, but *dammit* I put so much effort into learning about poppies only to have them hijacked.

Last time she took an opiate was god knows how long ago; her dad was addicted to hard opiates, mom probably as well so she might have a slight immunity to opiates. CONSIDERING SO;
she just took 5mg of Valium a few hours ago (4 hours) for the muscle contractions & 20mg of Vicodin 30min ago and I just gave her another 10mg of Vicodin and it's still not effecting her pain. She's not as snappy, but she's still hurting badly. Note the last period she had she only took 5mg of Valium and 10mg Percocet total which was two months ago, so she has 0 tolerance. How does this girl not get high as the sky and nod off of 30mg of Vicodin with absolutely no tolerance, some benzo in her system, no food in her belly and a slower metabolism? 

There was ONE time she tried to get High on opiates about a half a year ago, shot 30mg of morphine up the but, sniffed 15mg of oxycodone and took 15mg of oxycodone orally.. AND WAS WALKING AROUND SOBER. 
She's not taking anything behind my back and she has no interest in getting High all the time no addictive behaviors so what's up with this????

TL;DR: girlfriend, 18 years old, 0% drug tolerance, takes 5mg of diazepam (Valium®) 4 hours ago; takes 20mg of Hydrocodone/APAP (Vicodin®) 30min. ago; another 10/325mg Hydro/APAP (Vicodin®) and she is STILL IN PAIN!! Her dad was heavily addicted opiates before she was born, her mother probably was, so is it possible she had a natural tolerance from evolution of genetic coding imbedded into her DNA? SOMEONE GIVE ME AN ANSWER TO THIS because when I first started at 17-18, 1.25mg of Percocet would get me high, yes you read that right *1.25mg of oxycodone (Percocet)....",1495998149.0

I'm desperate. So desperate that I'm googling stupid things like ""how to make $1000 fast"" and the like. I've pawned or sold anything of value, borrowed from anyone that would remotely give me money. My habit is pretty small but it seems life is determined to screw me over at every opportunity (power steering hose leak, had to replace a tire this week, etc).

A while back I give my sister my power bill money to help with her cat's medical bills and when I hit her up for money this time around she couldn't help because the money she currently has is going towards (get this) herself a new watch. **seriously**?

I'm *freaking out* and it takes a lot to get me to this point. I always try to do the right thing whenever possible. I repaired my neighbors roof for free because she wasn't able to afford it, *gave* a guy with his daughter in a gas station $30 when his card was declined. Sometimes it would be nice if it came back around once or twice is all.

My mind is going down really bad avenues and I'm starting to unnerve myself with all the anxiety and strain.

I got hooked on Roxies a few years ago, and snorted them every single day. Like many of you know, I couldn't go 12 hours without withdrawal symptoms starting. It got to the point that all I cared about was the next blue pill I could crush up; forgetting about everything was all that mattered. It got to the point where I barely got high anymore and all I cared about was staying unsick. I combined xanax, klonopin, huge amounts of alocohol, and any opiate I could get my hands on.

I stole pain mess from my grandfather with Parkinson's, and his caretaker was fired because ""I would never touch those"". The caretaker's wife had cancer; I'm sure I affected his ability to support her. I kept stealing his hydrocodone until after he died, and at the time the only thing that mattered to me was my next dose. I stole thousands of dollars from my family to support my habit. I begged and pleaded with the dope man just so I could get my next fix.

My ""rock bottom"" came along last year, when I broke into my parent's best friend's house (a leukemia patient) because I knew he was prescribed oxycodone. I found 1 5mg pill, and immediately broke it down on their counter and snorted it. They later told my parents they saw me on their cameras; and this is when I realized I couldn't lead this sick life full of deceit and lies any more.

I got myself in a treatment program and accepted that I am an addict, and to use means to die a spiritual death. If my story could help even one person reading this, then I am grateful. I'm posting this here because I've seen so many damn people die from fentanyl lately, and I hope that none of you suffer the same fate. God bless everyone, and stay safe out there.",1496157436.0

""According to research cited by Stan Grof, about 30-50% of substance addicts (alcohol, hard drugs) are really just seeking a nondual experience.

That’s why you’re doing the alcohol or drug. It gives you a simulated pseudo-spiritual experience of unity. It blots out egoic consciousness. But you don’t know this because you haven’t actually experienced real unity, and you don’t yet understand what consciousness is. So you keep hitting that bottle or pipe but it never scratches that mystical itch.""

Id love to hear your experiences and stories, Ive never done anything harder that weed myself but drugs were part of the spiritual tradition in old times and perhaps there is some truth to the claims that for a while they get you to a higher level of consciousness.

Bit of a random one, but basically I am considering signing up for a clinical trial that involves being dosed with buprenorphine and narolex. The trial involves receiving 100mg of narolex orally the day before dosing, which is an IV dose of buprenorphine, and then 50 mg of narolex orally for the next 3 days. I don't actually know the exact dose of buprenorphine atm (I will find out soon) so I guess this could make my question a bit difficult to answer, but basically I was wondering what level of side effects to expect from this? Obviously I know the narolex is designed to block the action of opoids, but should I still expect significant side effects from buprenorphine, ie nausea, as well as perhaps from the narolex itself? I have never used opoids before, so will have no form of tolerance.

I was snorting Roxy's almost everyday for about a year, then I went through a horrible withdrawal and kicked it. 4 months went by then a friend called me up and told me he had some and offered to sell me some right away. I thought, it wouldn't hurt to buy a few and just enjoy a nice high for tonight. I bought 6 and then drove home. 

At the time, I was living with my grandmother and I would smoke weed in my car almost everynight before walking back inside her house. I sat in my car smoking and saw a girl across the street outside smoking a cig. I almost forgot how bad I craved cigs after doing some lines of Roxy's. I stepped out of my car and asked if I could bum one off of her. We talked and couldn't believe we've lived across from each other for 3 years and we're just meeting for the first time right now. We exchanged phone #s and made plans to hang out. I thought she was banging hot and I felt confident she liked to party. Sadly, I was moving 25 miles away the next day to a university I got accepted into, I told her. 
I couldn't stop thinking about her. I wanted to know more about her. I called her the next day and asked if she wanted to hang out. She told me to come over. Oddly enough, I drove back to my grandma's house  and we sat outside talking. Shes 4 years younger than me, she was a dancer but had to stop due to a foot injury, and she had a habit of taking norcos because of that injury. I asked her if she had ever tried Roxy's , she hadn't. I offered her some and she agreed to try a line. She loved it and we both had a very deep  and enjoyable conversation about whatever. It felt right. But the chemistry was skewed because we were high. I felt like I had just met my life partner and she felt the same.

 She started coming over to my new apartment and we started getting high everyday.a year later, we got an apartment together and had some money issues because we couldn't afford to get high and pay bills. We almost got evicted but we moved out just in time. We moved in with her mom and she brought home a dog she found at work. The dog became my best friend however, I tried addressing to her that having a dog was a big responsibility and commitment that I wasn't ready to take on. She quickly asked, ""you don't like the dog? What's wrong with him?"". She didn't understand what I was trying to say and wouldn't budge, so we kept the dog. 
 
Her mom moved and we had to find a new place to live. After going through $ issues and not having any family around. We found Kratom and got clean. We moved into a nice 1 bedroom apartment and started a new life: communal neighborhood, only  took pills in moderation, and had $. We had a nice balance. However, life became dull and we spent most of our time watching TV and working. I ended up walking the dog 4 times a day and feeding him. I needed an outlet, I couldn't live my life like this everyday. 
Also, we stopped having sex and hardly went out anywhere.

I picked up guitar again and started recording music. I started writing and drawing comics. I hung out with the neighbors and got close with some of them. I started filling out college applications for my masters degrees.  Then I met my neighbor who lived directly across from me.

She would play violin everyday and I enjoyed listening to her play. I had no idea who his person was and I was surprised I hadn't met them yet since I'm always out talking with the other neighbors. I had to find out who this fellow musician was. 

One day, I came home from work and saw a girl parked next to me. Getting out of her car, she pulled a violin case out and swung it around her arm. I hurried over to her and introduced myself. I told her I could hear her playing through the walls and I noticed she had improved over the months. I also told her that I was a musician too and wanted to play music with her if she were ever interested. We exchanged information and we started emailing each other, I sent her some of he music I worked on. 

After much chatting, she invited me over and we would talk and drink tea. Shes an English lady who was classically trained in music, she's traveled a lot, and she's 22 years older than me. I felt very close to her and I wanted to know more. 

She had no idea who I was and what I had gone through. She knew I lived with someone and didn't know we were together. We started talking weekly  and I tried avoiding her as much as I could. I couldn't let my GF at the time find out I was talking with the neighbor more than I had originally said. But at the same time, I really wanted to know more about her. 

Avoiding the neighbor made her want me more and she made a strong effort to make plans with me or get me to hang out. We went out on little dates to a movie, a concert, and a walk around the park. Then finally, I came over to her place and told her about my gf. I told her how dull our relationship had become and how we had fallen into a routine of. And I lied to her, I told her my GF and I weren't dating anymore and we only lived together for support. We kissed and started making out.  I don't know why I felt like saying this or going through with this lifestyle. I was fucked. I had a nice life with my GF and the dog, and I just flipped everything upside down by lying and kissing the neighbor. What if they met? What if my GF saw me going over to her place? What if the dog starts barking because he could hear my voice through the walls?
I tried to hold back and tried to think of different options. Maybe I could come clean to my GF? No way, I would be kicked to the curb and thr awkwardness of seeing the neighbor would haunt us for the rest of our existence at this place. 
I carefully lied to my GF about going out with friends, then I would walk next door and enter the neighbors apartment through the back door. She asked why I wanted to do that? So the dog wouldn't hear, and the neighbors didn't get the wrong idea. 

We spent many days together doing this, and she told me about some of her past relationship. One memory really struck me: a guy she was with told her he had a new job that requires him to travel every two weeks. His wife caught them both and he turned out a two timer. It had been about 15 years ago, she's 22 years older than me!

I couldn't be that guy. My GF and I weren't even intimate (about 2 years), and we didn't hang out ever outside of the apartment. I told her that I didn't want to be with her anymore and that we were better off as friends. I would be okay living together and living the same way. We were practically roommates anyways. 

It was the hardest break up. But we ended up friends and we were very civil the whole time.  She moved in with her dad who came around after 2 years, and the dog lives with them in his big house. 

I started living ​with the neighbor and I told her I completely broke things off with the GF ( she had thought we were just on a break). I told myself I would commit to her and I didn't want to be like any of those other douchebag guys who two timed her or were assholes. I safely transitioned myself from my last life to my new life, and I mostly take Kratom now. 

The big lesson to this I discovered was that I shouldn't have gone into a relationship on drugs, and while getting clean, i realized we weren't right for each other. The feelings weren't completely real, and it took months of struggling to realize this. The girl I live with now has no idea I had issues with pills in the past, however she knows I take Kratom, and I have only been taking Kratom for months now. I think I'll tell her one day, but for now, I want her to get to know the real me, not the guy who had a drug issue.

So I recently got a really good batch of dope/fent mix. While I've had this batch in the last 3 days I've burnt 3 wholes into my comforter, 2 wholes that have gone through my bed sheets and right now I just woke up and felt that my lap was really warm and got up real quick and cig flew from my lap on top of my khaki pants onto the floor and obviously burnt a whole through my shorts. The funny thing was when I stood up, my lap still felt really warm. I look back down at the whole and the circumference of the whole was a ring of fire as in the edges of the circle were still spreading cus they were on fire lol. Turns out they had burnt through the top of my khaki pants through the second little later directly behind the khaki and even through to my underwear leaving a tiny whole in my underwear and a tiny mark on my skin....

6e4xsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6e4xsi/rehab/,11,https://redd.it/6e4xsi,Cujuabled,Rehab,"Sup fam. So I just got a phone call from my best friend. I'm pretty tight with her, her mom, and her sister. I fit in like the brother the family never got. So my best friends sister recently asked my best friend, ""Hey, is Cujuabled doing heroin or something? What is he on?"" Keep in mind, this girl is a former junkie, several years clean, so my best friend spills everything to her. That's fine, whatever. 

Now my habit has gotten much worse lately. My best friend is really the only one who I have to talk to about it, and it's been kind of consuming me these days. The needle is a real bitch (for those of you who haven't shot up, keep it that way for fucks sake). It just took me of guard how as my habit worsens, somebody is able to pick me out as a dope fiend like that, though granted she was one herself. Anyway, back to today's phone call. 

She calls me to tell me that her mom now knows as well. She asks her out of nowhere, ""So, tell me, what is Cujuabled on? Pills or heroin?"" And my best friend promptly breaks down into tears. Our phone discussion goes from dissecting that conversation to her telling me the three of them have talked and they think I need to go to a facility. I've been fighting that idea for... years. I know it seems that way to everyone, but fuck I'm just so scared of the whole idea. It's honestly just terrifying to me. One of the scariest thoughts is that since I'm shit broke my parents would pay for the stay, and I'm just scared I'd be one of those who gets out and uses on the first day back into the real world. Thousands of dollars down the drain. 

However, I know I need to get some control back. My using doesn't feel like it's up to me anymore, I don't get to choose, heroin does. I'm just looking for thoughts on the situation and inpatient rehab as a whole. What do you think works and doesn't work about it? Is it all just perspective? Gimme something guys.",1496115511.0

Said best has zippy pockets on the sides of it. This, and my general  is crucial to the story. Yesterday we had a team meeting after work, where all of us got yelled at by our manager for not performing well for the last two weeks, after which we all brought up issues we had with the shop/each other, but after the bitching from our boss, we employees were much kinder to each other than she was. Nonetheless, I still wanted to get out of there asap and enjoy my weekend with some fire and relax in the pool. 

Trying to leave, I punched myself out and shoved my fugly best into my locker, wished my stressed out assistant manager happy holiday and bolted. I called my dgirl, got hooked up with my cash tips and went on my merry way.

Fast forward to today, when I wanted to meet up, and went to the atm to withdraw cash, only to realize that my card isn't in my wallet. In my haste to leave the work meeting, I had left my card in my vest pocket when I had taken it to the Wendy's across the parking lot at lunch. Great.

I sent my boss a text that said something like ""Hey boss, it's Violet. I'm really sorry to bother you, especially on a holiday, but I left my debit card in my vest pocket, and it's inside of my locker. Is there any way you could meet me at the shop to let me in and grab it?""

 The response was along the lines of: ""No Violet, it's a holiday and I am doing family things. It is your responsibility to remember your things, and maybe next time you'll learn.""

So I texted Assistant Manager, and her response was: ""Oh Sweetie, I'm so sorry, that sucks, and if I wasn't at the coast, I would totally be there to let you get it. Did you try Manager?""

I said yes, but that she was too busy and Assistant Manager said again that she felt bad for me. Well shit. I was totally prepared to ride it out without so much as a single lope to get me through.  So I waited, and waited until my skin was crawling, and even though it's really hot out, and put on a hoodie because my room is in on a basement and stays 60 degrees, no matter what the weather. When I stuck my hands into the front hoodie pockets to help my cramping fingers, my paln brushed against something plastic.  

Prepared to find an empty baggie to taunt myself with, I was utterly shocked to find what looked/felt like .30!!!! Not enough to get faded, but enough to get well and feel nice. I don't remember buying, having or losing this, and it must have been sitting there since before I moved in March. Complete windfall. I never thought I would have a JJ moment, considering my misfortune and bad luck, both accidental and self-inflicted. But he is real, and he does exist.

Ive been extensively researching it and it seems absolutely fucking crazy something like this has managed to slip by most people.

Dosing via dilluted solution in the microgram range seems to eliminate tolerance in any individual and prevent tolerance from building, even after 3 months of continued daily use. It also enhances analgesic effects and duration/speed of onset. 

Anybody else know anything about this.

this last run was so fucked up. got out of rehab September , stayed clean til November, overdosed and almost died that night. caught a possession charge because of that OD, then eventually a trafficking charge, because they were fucking watching. 

I really fucked up this time around. learned how to cook crack at 15, and have been selling every thing under the sun since. I even worked my way up to a quarter ki of mdma every 10 days and thought I was the shit. ten years in this game and I stayed out of trouble until I started using dope. everything collapsed around me.

I fucked my whole family up, my dad was even the one who set me up with the police to pick me up for my warrant because he was tired of seeing me go down hill like that. selling drugs, no problem, but when I got fucked up bad on dope he couldn't take it.

And before anyone suggests Kratom instead, it's illegal in my country and completely impossible to acquire or order. Sucks. Otherwise I'd gladly use that instead.

So SWIM dragged a childhood baptist Christian friend to the middle of the city to ask strangers at the bus station for a few dime bags.
Now 13 years later SWIM feels this is a much bigger step and should write about it for other very bad kids to hear) 

((ALSO THIS IS MY FIRST REDDIT FORUM POST!!!))

So anyway... SWIM ran out of solid Diesel connects this last month. All but one who sells bundles which are a little outside SWIM's price range and subsequently not worth the price for sometimes less than 3 points for $80

So SWIM decided to take maters into SWIM's own hands and take on the ancient art of cold copping.

As a paranoid person who has pretty much grown up immersed in multiple  drug sub cultures, this is an endeavor that left SWIM more or less perplexed, frightened, and intimidated by the general idea. 

Using the tools police officers and agencies SWIM has come to detest to track down the commodities he desires and needs to locate is deffinitely an ironic turn of events.

But swim's good friend who hooked him up with Swin's first solid dilaudid connection, grabbed SWIM a sack of some really strong stuff and unfortunately kept one for himself and overdosed on it last month. 
So unable to grab a burner laptop and all the other necessities to start piracy on the high seas of the DW, SWIM decided to exhaust every resource possible.

It came to the point where after SWIM had dosed at the clinic in the morning SWIM was trying to network with other clinic goers or bums/ vagrants that crossed SWIM's path.

SWIM found a few hopeful names and numbers that cost him a few bucks, a couple American spirits and a quarter gram of hash oil. (One of them supposedly has offered to help SWIM get set up on the DW)
But surprisingly, SWIM's cold cop connection came on the wings of a back page transvestite escort!

SWIM had messaged a few to no available however this specific  ad mentionedParty Favors""

And low and behold SWIM found some very rocky light brown/ tan powder that cuts right through SWIM's 100 mg done dose!

But Alas SWIM is about to go do a fourth shot and maybe post a picture.

Depending on how you do it, I guess. I think the best way would be to overdose. I'm experienced with opiates and I know my limits, I know what can happen if I push those limits. What if I pushed those limits even farther? 

I've never been someone who was bullied, but lately people have been bringing me down, making fun of me and telling me to kill myself. I've always had anxiety and low self confidence but I've tried to make a change and really thought I had progress. I was clean off of oxy. Now I feel myself slipping into the same old ways. 

A few weeks ago I tried to overdose on some OP 15s I had picked up. I was drinking heavily and I figured finishing the 7 I had with all the drinking would be enough, guess I was wrong. Was kind of hoping it would have been enough. I don't know to feel now. After I tried to kill myself and failed, I bought a 25 key dboy said were ""laced with fent or some shit"" for $250 and while talking to a friend while drunk she told me to flush them and I did. I regret it. I regret flushing my escape plan. 25 would have done it, I know for a fact, even if he was bullshitting about being laced.

There were a few times where I spent a few monthes addicted to oxy and I'm falling back into its trap. I've spent so much money on stupid pills, probably thousands at this point. Addiction is easy when you're a small guy and even the lowest of doses hit you like a brick, 3 15s a day was doable to stay normal. At my lowest, I'd just take anything I'd find. 

It's been hard lately, school has been stressful and its only getting worse with exams coming up. Friends are leaving me because either they see me for who I am or are sick of my shit. I'm broke, owe my parents money, owe friends money. I can't afford university and my marks are shit even though I work my ass until 4am every night, I average less than 2 hours of sleep a night.

(Slightly JJ),"So before I started getting the scripts I'm currently on for my shitty spine (20mg oxy every 6 hours) I was buying 30s for a year from 1 dude who I also got bud from. He was a friend but like we became friends by me buying from him whatever. Anyways, we had a good relationship, he would front me whatever I needed and I always got his money back the day I said I would. Sometimes I'd give him the cash before his reup so I knew He wouldn't sell out before I got mine. There was trust in the relationship (as much as there can be in the game) 

Fast forward to the end of that year period. He was dropping bud off with me and headed to reup on the blues so I gave him 275 so I would have 11 (25 per) and he said he would have them within an hour. 

Y'all see where this is going. Dude ghosts for 9 months guys. He always delivered to me so I didn't know where he lived, plus I'm crippled and not tryna get any legal repercussions over what's realistically not that much money. I basically gave up after the first month, let alone 9. But then miraculously, he texts me out of nowhere and apologizes and says he is going to make good on it. 

And he did! 9 months after I paid I got my 30s, plus 4 extra for free because of the whole situation. I hesitate to call that junkie Jesus since I did pay for them but he definitely had a little influence",1496199664.0

I always have real pharma scripts of blues no matter what, I have almost every given popular manufactured IR 30 on the market at most major pharmacies, as I have my own, and I sponsor many others scripts for purposes I'm sure you can understand.. As where im from, let's just say, pill mills aren't unheard of.. LOL.. (Hope that's not against rules, since I was vague)As well as personal use.. So anytime I see fake presses on the streets, I normally have real blues to compare it to, an therefore is even easier to spot fakes for me than solely from my own experience, with that being said.. I have taken some of my own pictures of side by side comparison of fakes vs real blues.. Although I'm currently on mobile, can anyone, or a mod, help point me in the right direction of how to post photos?? I figured it would be useful/helpful to this community for all my pill people buyin off streets without scripts, an any youngins experimenting with oxy/blues..",1496198429.0

So I wrote a post before about my dboy all star... well all of a sudden out of nowhere he turned on me and idk why said I was being unloyal...and started cussing me out telling me to fuck off you faggit suck a dick and lose my number. 


So sat I see him everything is cool just like normal. I ended up locked up sat day and night into Sunday  for some BS cause my license is out of state even tho I live in ny state now I couldn't prove it so I had to get booked first time in my life. So Sunday afternoon  when I got out I had left over from meeting my dude sat so I was all set. Monday I didn't have a car so he said he would deliver but then got in a fight w/ his girl so said he couldn't come out and I said if I can get to u I'll come by he said cool np. Today I text him and he starts up by saying Yo fuck u unloyal fag u going to someone else after I treated u mad well.. I'm like what You mean man? I'm confused. He's like ya you gave my money to someone else yesterday unloyal thats fucked up man. I explained to him nah I didnt I actually went without yesterday but had money today and wanted to come by. He said I owe him money all of a sudden...i didn't even question it cause he clearly was on edge he texts me back and says come thru I got you just don't play w/ me. I said I never do dude you my #1 by far. He says just come thru don't text me till u here...which again isnweird he's usually really friendly and we get along great. 


I text him about ah hour later saying Yo I'm gonna be a little bit I got  to stop by school but I'll be by this afternoon to pay up and pick up. He responded with fuck you u unloyal FUCKIBG pussy suck a dick you faggit. Don't text me no more move on we are done lose my number you FKN faggit. At this point I'm genuinely confused and ask if he knows he's talking to doobious and he responds I know who the fk I'm talking to  I'm talking to an unloyal pussy ass bitch. And that I need to never text him again and to fuck off followed by more faggits oussys and go suck a dick...

So I lost my #1 today and I have no real idea why. Should I just leave it and take the loss or should I wait a few days let him calm down and hope he was having a bad day? Idk wtf changed over a 2 day period. This guy has taken me out to dinner bought my cigs fronted me and I always paid up we were chill completely chill and then he just lost it on me. He knew I lost my car but I think he thinks I'm lying and found a new connect...I didn't. And now I'm down to one dude whose shit and service isn't even a quarter as good as the other guys but I just don't know what happened


Has any one ever had this happen before? I know dboys can be temperamental but this was totally out of the blue. And seemingly out of character...idk sorry for the long winded post but I'm just so confused by what happened and really have no one to talk to or share the story with so I figured I'd tell you guys.

Just wanted to share how lucky I am to have this dude...or unlucky depending on how you look at it lol. So my running mate and myself have been on about a 6 month run after being clean for a year or so. Anyways. We basically ran out of money about a month ago and have been scraping by ever since. Every time we meet up with dude he always gives us double what we pay for and then adds the remaining amount to our ""debt list"". He knows how much we make and our bills so he doesn't expect us to pay him back quickly. I should say that last time we went on a run our tab was 800 when we quit and we paypaled him every paycheck when we were clean until it was paid. For example today I have him all I had which was $80 and he gave us a G. In my area G's go for 130-160 and halfs for 80-100. Yesterday he gave us a half for 40. This occurs almost everyday. 

So this morning when we rolled up on him he surprised us and gave us 4 sub strips and 8 10mg valium to help us get off cuz we been saying we wanted to take a break so can actually start to pay him back. 

Sorry for the shit post but I wanted to share and it got me thinking if anyone of your guys' connects are this nice? Usually I hear horror stories of plugs being assholes etc etc.

An ever revolving door of defeat and success. On my birthday I had been clean about 2 weeks, and felt I had deserved a relapse. I deserved that high!

I slapped my arms again and again. The hard abscesses that once were had given way to bouncy, healthy veins again. I poked them daily, smiling, as if looking at my newborn child. How I could not wait to pierce them again with an insulin needle full of heroin. At 9 am on the dot, the pharmacy opened. I jumped into my car, gas light on, and sped downtown to pick up a rig. The smile on my face comparable to a Cheshire Cat. 

The first time, I was careful. I did one bag, I was alone. When my girlfriend and I made up, and she came back, I knew I was a little more safe. She was still unaware I had relapsed, but in the back of my mind I knew the dangerous path I had stumbled back on. 

I removed the remaining 3 narcan from my bedside drawer.

""If you ever see me not breathing, not responding, stick this in my nose, all the way in, and push down""

""Why? You have been clean""

""Just in case babe. It's better to be safe""

I never thought in a million years she'd actually have to do it, but something still compelled me to inform her. I was aware my tolerance had dipped. I wasn't aware just quite how much.

Later in the day, after a half a handle of vodka, I prepared a 2 bag shot. At this point, I had admitted my relapse and she was well aware of the procedure. Tie off, blast off, lay down in bliss. 

I remember the tie off, the blast off.... and then I remember being smacked in the face, hard. 

She was crying, she was angry. She was holding my head up. 

""What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you think it's fucking funny to put me through this? I had to use all the narcan on you!""

My mind was in a daze. I slowly sat up, surveyed the bed and sure enough, 3 dispensed narcan lay haphazardly on my sheets. One by one tossed aside when they failed to rouse me. 

""Did you give it a second to work? Why did you waste all 3?""

""I WAITED A MINUTE IN BETWEEN. IM NOT GOING TO WAIT WHILE YOUR DYING IN MY ARMS""

I immediately felt like an asshole. I'm worried about wasted, essentially free narcan when I just put someone I love dearly through something so emotionally taxing. 

""My head. Please. Give me a bag, I'll sniff it ok? I just need something. You knocked all the opiates out of my system""

Her eyes. Her eyes said more words than I can convey. She just saved me from an overdose, and I wake up and request the poison that killed me. But I am in pain. I am an addict. This is what cures me.

Not methadone I don't think.
 
what is it that makes tramadol have  the same withdrawals as any other opiate?

considering it's one of the weakest opioids how come tram has such  pronounced detox?
 does it have more opioid affects the people know people tend to believe because the withdrawals are comparable wlith heroin almost.

could it be because Tramadol is also a heavy anti depressant as well as being a pain killer ?",1496170309.0

I am at the point where I'm using about 1 and a half to 2 a day. Without I cannot function, go to work, sleep, be socially normal. I have began stealing from everyone who is close to me. Family, friends, anyone. How do I stop this? If I come clean to my family my whole life will change, and my girlfriend will break up with me because she has warmed me in the past if I ever do these again we will be done. She is my life and I haven't come clean in fear of losing her. Is there a way to stop without cold turkey? I cannot miss my work and it is manual labor that is grueling without my pills. I am burning bridges left and right and I don't know how to get out of it. Please someone give me advice, or a success story or suggestions on what I should do. I'm sick of living this lie but I'm even more worried about what will happen if I come clean. 
Anything can help. Going to doctor on my own? How to get a script of lesser dose to ween off? What should I do. I'm in panic and sick of being controlled by these ",1496164153.0
