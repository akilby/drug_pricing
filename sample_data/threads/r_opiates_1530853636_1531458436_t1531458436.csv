8yeeke,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8yeeke/should_i_start_treating_myself_a_bit_more_instead/,4,https://redd.it/8yeeke,time_to_forget,"Should I start treating myself a bit more, instead of worrying about waiting so long in between doses? (Also, mildly interesting chart inside)","On the Side: For fun, I've been keeping track of what I've been taking for a couple of months and I figure someone might find it interesting, and it also ties in to what I'm about to elaborate on. Here's a pic of the Excel sheet: https://imgur.com/a/gPzUiMQ

So I try to keep my opiate consumption down to weekends (may start early Thursday, usually nothing Sunday), or to weekday events like a show/event etc. I do this mainly to keep tolerance's low across the board so I can keep enjoying 5-10mg of hydrocodone (in a day), as well as any dose of pregabalin.

The thing is, I feel like I'm thinking/worrying about it too much, as I'd rather just enjoy the drugs instead of creating this idea in my head of how amazing it's going to be after a weeks+ wait. I say all this primarily because I did just that, waiting it out for a pretty good show (TBS, TSSF, C&C).

So I take a break for about 13 days, the day of the show comes, and I go through my ""Make the best of it"" ritual; 30mg DXM, 400mg Magnesium, 20mg Zinc, 600mg Agmatine. Wait 30 minutes, drink some WGFJ, wait a little, take a tums or two, pop 2 Percs (since it was a special event), and finish by drinking a bit more WGFJ. I get to the show an hour later, take a 300mg Pregabalin, and end up meeting some people and chillin with them for most of the show. After 3-4 hours, I never really felt the usual effects, given everything I did and the combo on top of it. This may have had something to do with a bit of anxiety hanging out with new people I just met (but I'm usually a social butterfly on anything, and I'd taken a 1mg clonazepam earlier that day), or the fact that I had half a gin and tonic (though I drank water the rest of the time). Towards the end, I pop another 300mg pregabalin, a 7.5mg hydro, and a .25mg alprazolam just because ""fuck it, I don't do these types of things enough, not feeling too great, and It's a Friday"".

The next morning, I felt like I'd literally wasted all those drugs. Yeah, I probably shouldn't have done the last couple of them, but regardless I felt like I got very little out of each drug when usually, I feel great doing any one of these on my own.

So this is my question. Should I be a bit more indulgent then keeping to waiting a week+? Do any of you have a similar style, and keep things fun doing stuff a bit more frequently? These are all pretty much replacements to drinking, and being stone cold sober for the week is screwing with my head. I have hobbies, and keep busy so It's not like I'm always thinking about getting high, but the idea of creating the perfect time is what I think is the problem. I'd love to pop something now since I'm winding down the week, but there's another event going on tomorrow so I'd rather just wait it out another day for the tolerance etc. (and that in turn just makes me more antsy about it all).

I know most of you are into harder things and this may all just sound like whining from someone doing amateur hour stuff, but It's just been on my mind for a while and I wanted to write it out and get some peoples thoughts on just lifestyle around doing your drugs in general. Thanks for reading.

P.S I've done harder stuff in the past back in college (oxy, dillies, opana on the daily etc.) and the fact that I'm even able to enjoy a 5mg hydro for a couple of hours these days is mainly why I've tried to keep to this regiment. Granted, I'd love to start upping my clonazepam (or anything I have) every now and then to enjoy the day a bit more, but I'm terrified of fucking up my tolerance, and I don't know how to space any of it out to keep it enjoyable/therapeutic.

They said you could prepare your heroin in 1 spoon and coke in another then draw up your dope and draw up a tiny drop of vegetable oil and then draw up your coke. This should keep the boy and girl separated in the rig with the girl below the boy so it hits you first. I imagine it would give you a crazy coke rush followed by boy to mellow it out. Would this be good though? In a speedball the rushes come together to make a perfect rush (like that movie the perfect storm except rushes). It sounds like a neat idea nevertheless. Like a roller coaster going way up then plunging down.

What do all of you think about this? I always mix my boy with girl anyway. I'm 1 of those addicts that would be so very disappointed to go try to get dope but not also get coke with it. Its like what's the point? I used to have drug dreams about trying to find boy for a super long time and then finally getting it only to wake up right before I do it. Now I dream I have boy but am on a lord of the rings scale journey to find girl to mix in so I can be satisfied. ",1531429765.0

I know I could just use foil but I kind of suck at that. For those that don't know, pinners are where you take about a matchead's size piece of black tar heroin (or can you do it with any other types? It doesn't seem like it would work bc it needs to be sticky to stick to your poker) and stick it to something pointy (I'll call it your poker I guess) like the end of an unfolded paperclip. Then you heat something up like a knife or I heat up a glass stick  I found in a head shop (one end has a little glass sphere at the end, the other is a thinner glass flat circle, both ends work for this method) with a butane torch until it's red hot and then you bring the heroin on your poker to the heated area of whatever other tool you chose to heat up as fast as possible moving it all around, back and forth, doesn't matter, just making sure to heat the heroin by putting it against the hot surface, while inhaling through a tooter (a straw, hollow tube, or broken pen (the hollow tube part) work fine), hold it in as long as possible, exhale and then enjoy the feeling... :)

Since I can get afghan heroin so much cheaper (it's like 1/5 the price of bth) do you have any ideas on how to make afghan heroin stick to the poker to make this all work or is there any way I could do something like add vinegar etc. to just change it to black tar heroin (bc I heard it's the acid in bth that makes it bth?)?

Just seems the slower, smoother music compliments the high better. However, one my of my favorite rappers, Earl Swearshirt, always fits perfect with some oxy’s. His monotone voice and rhythmic flow take my ear pussies on a roller coaster of sound.

I was against myself. The odds were irrelevant.","We lived together at Becky’s until she kicked him out for accidentally giving her 3-year-old daughter a burnt crack spoon to eat her Fruit Loops.  Not to mention his first week of living there, when he and I took Becky’s newest boy toy out on an all-night coke binge and left her with the kids at the house.  Doh-Doh missed a vein that night and got an abscess, which he drained a few days later with a knife that he bought at Walmart, after drinking a fifth of tequila.  Three of her kids watched him cut it open and squeeze the puss into the kitchen sink before he fell on his mattress in the living room.  He cried and punched the wall.

When she kicked him out I left, too.  We moved to the Hacienda Inn a few doors down from where I detoxed before.  We worked every day doing construction and shot up lots of cocaine every night in our room.  

On several occasions our own bad choices reduced us to eating packets of powdered creamer and sugar.  We licked the granules from our greasy palms and smacked our tongues to the roofs of our mouths, desperate for sustenance.  Doh-Doh had a good point when he said they tasted better together.  On the job site another worker got mad at me for eating a loaf of soggy bread he had left there a week before.  Our clothes were less like fabric and more like some strange moss that grew on our bodies always damp and cold.  When I smoked I tapped cigarette ashes onto my pants and rubbed them in.  

Doh-Doh did big shots of cocaine and stared at the curtains and held the syringe in his hand, cupping both of his ears.  Blood ran down his arms.  His dentures hung halfway out of his mouth.  There was no response to anything I said.  When I would hallucinate hearing the boots of the SWAT team running up the old iron stairs to bust us, I flushed our stash, and another time I keistered it and walked miles to Becky’s house at 3 a.m. to watch “Forrest Gump” until I came down.  Doh-Doh said it was a very rude thing to do.

I told you before that the owner of the Hacienda Inn wasn’t kind to me and Doh-Doh, and while that may be true, we were not innocent in our dealings with him.  For a month or more, we flushed syringe after syringe down the toilet, until it finally backed up.  Water leaked through the ceiling into the room below us, and the owner kicked us out the next day.  He tried to keep our stuff, but the disgruntled employees let us grab what we could.  It wasn’t like we had anything valuable.  

Carlos had just purchased a 1994 blue Chevy S10 for me with money my parents sent him.  We put the truck in my name, and Doh-Doh found me the next day.  It was around Thanksgiving, and our friends, a lesbian couple with a baby, let us stay at their place for the week while they visited family.  We did big shots of cocaine like always, and I almost burned the building down, afraid of the shadow people. 

Doh-Doh talked me into jumping through the neighbor’s window and borrowing the DVD player and flat screen without ever talking to the guy.  Doh-Doh said it was cool, because he had done a mutual friend’s taxes once.  I don’t think we ever watched a movie, but when the neighbor, his girlfriend and the landlord busted through the door, we had rags over our mouths and the room smelled like paint thinner.  I can’t remember what we said, but it’s hard to imagine our words were any consolation to the incensed trio.  The girl accused me of being a peeping tom.  It was not clear how she got that idea, but the stolen electronics in our possession and the solvent-soaked rag in my hand made me feel like I wasn’t credible.  I kept quiet.

8yba36,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8yba36/common_ropiates_misconceptions_thread/,60,https://redd.it/8yba36,diacetylhydroxymorph,Common r/opiates Misconceptions Thread,"There has been a lot of talk lately (and always) about cutting down on the frequently asked and easily googled questions here. In that spirit, I thought we could get a thread going to talk about some of the common misconceptions and incorrect information that comes up all the time in posts and comments here, and we could all share a little knowledge with one another.

For instance...

1. It’s not the naloxone in Suboxone that blocks opiates and causes PWD, it’s the buprenorphine. In the case of blocking, this partial agonist binds too tightly to the receptors to allow regular doses of opiates/opioids to saturate the already saturated receptors. On the flip side, the bupe has a higher affinity for the receptors, so when you injest bupe wen there is already a full agonist on your receptors, it “knocks off” the agonist and throws you into instant PWD. The amount of Naloxone is negligible (and poorly absorbed when taken orally or sublingually), so the Naloxone couldn’t be causing either of these effects anyway - hence why you can IV Suboxone.

2. Oral BA of Oxycodone is much higher than intranasal BA. While we are at it, the same goes for Alprazolam (and sublingual is even higher than oral, and peaks almost as quickly as intranasal dosing.)

3. Types of dope. No.3 Heroin is Heroin base, it is primarily found in Europe, it is not water soluble (must be broken down with an acid), and it is far more smokable than No.4. Fully refined No.4 Heroin (hcl) is primarily found in the eastern US - hence EastCoastPowder - and is easily soluble in water (please god, don’t heat it up), and smoking it is an awful waste (if you are going to do it at least add some caffeine to slow down the “burn.”) BlackTarHeroin is also No.4, but is not fully refined to powder form, and is water soluble (again, without heat. It is sometimes a pain in the ass to break down without heat, but you save precious product and you avoid dissolving any less soluble cuts) and easily  smoked. As an aside, saying “I have China White” nowadays is like saying “I have Orange Sunshine LSD.” 9/10 times it will be fent, and the chance of an average user or even a mid level dealer EVER seeing anything near 80% purity is slim to none.

4. Boiling your shots is a good way to lose product, not kill bacteria. The shot would have to be boiled for several minutes at a high temperature to kill anything, at which point your dope would be gone.

5. Cotton fever’s name refers to fever caused by injecting bacteria that was growing in your cotton and carries into your shot. But “cotton safety” isn’t a guarantee of prevention. There is some debate about the bacterial angle, but  VERY often it’s bacteria from your works, your spoon, your dope, or some foreign particle slipping into your solution and then into your blood stream. It can come from anywhere so sterilize EVERYTHING including your hands and your injection site. It sucks, and I wouldn’t wish it on (almost) anyone.



So yeah guys. Chime in on those little common misconceptions you see around here or in your circle of using acquaintances or even from normies. Let’s get some knowledge flowing around!",1531412959.0

I've had an on-again-off-again habit for 8 years. I always end up relapsing in the summer when the busy season hits at work (pathetic maybe but, I can't seem to cope with working more than 45ish hours a week without drugs...)

I always loathed the thought of getting on methadone. I like to go on backpacking trips and similar adventures and didn't want to be tied down to a pharmacy. And I'm scared of methadone wds.

Now I'm thinking fuck it, better than being tied down to an unreliable dealer right? And I can't go on any adventures when all of my money is going to him.

My first question to y'all: Do you think it's worth it in my situation? My habit is small relative to many of you I'm sure -- about a quarter gram a day of potent stuff (probably laced with fent). For this relapse daily use began about 2 months ago. At that level, would it be easier to just tough out the wds do you guys think? 

Though another prob with cold turkeying it is obviously the fiending and cravings. Is methadone *actually* effective at eliminating (or significantly reducing) cravings?

These ones will probably vary between regions and possibly even between clinics, but any anecdotal answers are appreciated anyway:

Will I need to take a piss test on my first visit to the clinic? And do they watch you? (I get stage fright...just wondering so I can drink a bunch of coffee beforehand to help with that)

How long does it generally take between your first appointment and actually getting (and being able to use) your script?

The color of the coating was orange, and looks exactly like the shade it is supposed to be (I live in Europe). Put it in my mouth for a bit so I can peel it off and tastes exactly like it’s supposed to as well.

I’ve never seen unmarked pills and am a bit worried, maybe it’s nothing but I still want to ask for a second opinion. Let me know if you guys think they’re alright and if you’ve encountered these before.

Ive met men who were unrivaled in their wisdom and kindness; Extending help to any friend and foe. Never failing to genuinely want to understand a persons predicament. From that same man I learned that underneath that kind, joyful personality was the complete oppsite. A war vet, ruthless, borderline sadistic, wicked dark sense of humor. A trained killer in his youth, molded by a life of hardship and struggle.

 This old man, the same one that is always seen smiling and never failing to brighten others day with the light he straight the fuck up radiates, has a side dark enough to blot out the sun.
Now if you got chance to read the other shit i wrote you have an idea of how I write and talk; below casual, maybe even improper at times. But when I describe this man and tell his story, it is with the upmost reverance and respect. My words fail to do justice to the love and gratitude I have for this man.

Mr Dennis, I met him through work while I was a turbine technician. I was the youngest technician at 18, to work for this multimillion dollar company, at an gas turbine overhaul facility. Having a position created specifically to allow one as young as me to work. But I got that way because Mr Dennis took me under his wing, he never failed to teach me multiple ways to do things, and explaining why not just the how. (This honestly made me love teaching and helping others, if they are willing to learn. ) 
This was not exclusive to just work though, I always had traits of a sociopath, such as feeling little or no emotions such as guilt, regret, or empathy. I dont laugh much or  joke, My demeanor is always serious, my voice never changing tones, But with Mr Dennis, I would laugh and smile, with my own attempts of humor after realizing we share that much. I felt a bond form I never had come close to forming with any human being. I learned we're alot more alike than I thought. Like tf, how could such a good person be anything like me? 

I was always receptive to anything Mr Dennis would teach me, telling learning different shit is never a bad thing. Another thing I embedded into the way I think. A year or so went by, and we grew close, never having grandparents, I called him my gramps. He had no say in the matter. He was thrown off by the change in character, cos i rarely show affection or any sort of admiration to any coworkers, but to me thats the last thing he was.

I excelled in my field, At 20, I understood and could balance rotating masses, assemble each and every variant of turbine we worked on enough so to begin writing procedures. I truly blossomed , having used my full potential for once in my life. But I never stopped learning as long as he didnt stop teaching. Every lesson I instilled in every ounce of my being, to show that the same time and effort he put in, id return ten fold. 

With this he knew I would be susceptible to, as he puts it "" Gettin too big for your britches"" not wanting me to "" get caught with your pants down and Johnson floppin"" In other words, to be humble. To know there is always someone better always one who knows more than you. Ill be damned, because I was just bout to have my Johnson flop out. I did get cocky, In my eyes I did earn it, and no longer needed help from other technicians, but since Gramps said , "" theres no harm in hearing something you already know, who knows it might be the same lesson with a new perspective kiddo"" 
That shit blew my mind. I was like fuck u right gramps. I learned to be understanding, or try to, for the sole purpose of a new perspective. Never realising that its akin to,  two people viewing the same mountain, from different angles. Its essentially the same mountain, and one man sees a path the other would never have known existed.

When I’m having a good nod, I usually curl up into bed and spend an hour or two in full nod mode, fantasizing about sex with a specific person.

I only have 2 other female friends who use opiates, and one of them experiences this and the other one doesn’t. Sometimes while I’m nodding during these fantasies, in the back of my mind I wish I had a pen and paper to jot down the scenarios I think of because sometimes, they’re straight up trashy romance novel worthy. Sometimes I’ll reach for my phone while I’m nodding and go to my Notes and attempt to jot down a few sentences, but it always comes out as absolute gibberish, with random letters, numbers, and emojis all over my screen 😂 I’ve been using opiates off and on for about 6 years, and even in the beginning when I was still getting used to opiates and how they affected my mind and body, I was experiencing this.

I absolutely love the sense of community on this sub.  Anyways, I’m a pain patient that has been getting prescribed 100 norcos (10/325) per month for the past 6 years and then purchases more of the same medication elsewhere when that script runs out mid month. I know Hydrocodone is weak in comparison to many of the ops I see here but I love it and am grateful for what I get (especially these days).  I’m ashamed to admit that during these last 6 years, I have always just eaten every pill as is and never bothered to remove the Tylenol. I understand that it’s horrible for my liver, and while I never ingest more than 4 grams of APAP a day and yearly physicals have shown normal liver function, you fine people have encouraged me to take the time to do CWEs. While I fully understand how to actually do the extraction, good ol’ Google couldn’t answer the following questions for me: How long is the filtered solution good for after the extraction is complete? For example, if I do a CWE on 20 pills tonight, will my solution be good all day tomorrow? If so, should I refrigerate it or keep it at room temperature? Also, would you say that the Hydrocodone is evenly dispersed throughout the liquid? For example, would drinking half of my solution be equivalent to 100 mgs or is it impossible to know how much active medicine is in a poured dose?

I was mistaken.,"Well you guys were right. Certainly I was totally depressed, Moody, and feeling like crying on my birthday when I finally felt bad enough for myself to fly a sign and pan handle $10. The moment I made that petty amount of cash, I dragged my sick ass self across the metro lines and boarded two trains to some project buildings in NY that will remain unnamed. 

Well, I copped a single bag, spun around, and came back the way I came. The whole time I was thinking to myself ""at least my day can't get any worse."" That's when I noticed the two cops that had jumped out of their suv about a hundred feet ahead of me as they doubled back to my location. ""Someone's about to get fucked, lol."" I thought as I chuckled to myself. ""Hey buddy, just going for a quick one minute sprint through some of the most dangerous projects in the city?"" Well fuck. That someone is me.

""N-no, it's my birthday and-""

I didn't even know where I was going with this. The cops already had me cuffed and were already going through my back pockets. My single pathetic bday bag was in my front jeans pocket. Seriously they must have been watching me the entire minute I was there because they found it in <30 seconds. 

Needless to say, I went to jail and was booked on a misdemeanor possession of heroin. I was released at which point I, while  sick as fuck, took the half of a suboxone they found but neglected to discard or charge me with.

She really wanted me to go. It would be a good place to bum cigarettes. Besides, getting out of the house was nice, and I liked talking to the other addicts. Alcoholics were nice too but seemed antiquated and out of touch with the chemical realities facing meth, heroin and cocaine addicts. Meetings are meetings, and they said the same things there that they say across the country. It works if you work it. One day at a time. Just let go and let God. One man stood up and said something like,

“I know that I judge myself worse than anyone else. Do you guys know what I’m saying? We are always our own worst critics.” That was false. He’d obviously never heard me criticize another human being.

A small blond girl with a crooked face stamped onto the bottom of pale and lumpy head smiled at me. She followed me to and around every meeting I attended and maintained a certain air of morbidity when we talked. I liked another girl though, a black-eyed Apache princess, who had a soft spot for green eyes like mine. Her name was Gabriella.

Gabriella took me home on a Wednesday night after a meeting. We sat on her couch. We locked eyes. We kissed, and in the morning, she walked around the living room on thoroughbred thighs and cooked breakfast. Her eyes opened wide when we talked. She told me that she liked everything I liked. We were the same person, soul mates, and fate had brought us together. I told her stupid things. I told her I wanted to be a writer. I told her that I loved her. She took me to the store and bought me a Smith-Corona Coronet 12 Electric Typewriter because she loved me too.

Gabriella took me back to my aunt’s house to pick up my stuff, which was nothing but a toothbrush and a few pairs of boxers. I let my aunt know that I was moving into Gabriella’s house. She asked me not to. I told her it was better for her and Steve. She said I needed stability. I told her Gabriella would provide it. She thought it was a terrible idea, and she was right.

Gabriella was sobbing at the door when we got back. Black eyeliner tears ran down her face. She fumbled in her bag for the key. I quietly clutched my toothbrush and boxers because it was obvious something serious had just changed. Inside, she walked directly back to the bedroom and flung herself on the bed. I sat behind her and kept calm. She cried until I fell asleep. She got up to start cooking a pot of meatballs at four in the morning, and when I woke up, I found an untouched bottle of lithium, a month’s supply, in the bathroom with her name on it. It was eight months old.

Things disintegrated after that. We talked about her taking her meds, and she always promised to start. She never did.She was supposed to start seeing a therapist. She never did. I worked three days a week at a local Vietnamese restaurant. When I came home, she’d either jump into my arms and kiss me and tell me she missed me so much or she would be in bed crying or cleaning the house with chemicals and cooking large vats of food neither of us ever ate or sometimes she broke glass figurines and cups at my feet for no reason. However perfect we were together and in love and happy during her manic upswings was equally how disgusting and emotionally abusive I was and miserable she was when depression came on and things plummeted. I never knew what I was going to get.

We went to meetings. There were signs that she had started using again and was lying about it. I hoped for the best. I tried with all I had to believe she was still sober, but at a meeting one night, she began opening a bag of Sour Patch kids during the preamble and still hadn’t opened it when the meeting ended. She kept dropping it and getting stuck when she leaned over to pick it up.

I had unintentionally acquired a white-haired sponsor named Dave. He was an ex-firefighter. Dave came to visit me where I worked, when it was slow. He offered a lot of advice. He liked to share his opinions, and one of my last days at the restaurant, one of the last days of sobriety and pretending life was actually going to work out for me, he asked,

“So, Clyde, did you ever talk to your boss about what I said? I really think the place would feel more authentic if he had an Asian girl working the front instead of you.”

“I told him, and he said he didn’t care what you thought. I think that’s about as authentic as it gets.” I laughed. He laughed, and in one second, I went from liking Dave to hating him. Something about his white hair and being retired from firefighting grossed me out and pissed me off, and I knew that our friendship was over. I hated him for being an alcoholic. He was divorced from an ex-wife who hated him. Now I hated him the same way she did.

Back at the house with Gabriella, I hid from her. On a Friday morning before I left, she admitted to using heroin and benzos. We made an agreement that she would stop the next morning after enjoying one last day with the drugs. When I got home from work she was sleeping it off, and I went to the back room to sit at the typewriter. The stress of everything with her and Dave and not shooting up anymore or being violent stifled me. It didn’t seem like it could work. As I sat with my hands and fingers poised over the keys, I imagined a large and ever expanding latex balloon inside of me. It held all my heartbreak, my love, my hatred, my violent proclivities, my weaknesses, my memories, my creative potential, my failures and marred images of myself. These things mixed to create caustic gasses and pressure in the balloon. I knew it needed to be let off, and I knew that this thing inside of me would explode and kill me and everything around me if I didn’t. I knew writing was the outlet. I just didn’t know how to open the valve. Before I went to sleep, I banged out the only words I ever wrote on that typewriter.

“Write it, Clyde. It will kill you if you don’t. This is your only chance. It’s over after this. You’ve got to get it out.

Sincerely,

Clyde.”

Before my eyes opened it had already begun. Gabriella chucked the typewriter through the bedroom window to wake me up. It was freezing outside. She was screaming. There was black blood running down her wrists and arms flinging droplets from her fingers as she wailed and foamed at the mouth. There was no way I would be able to focus on her keeping her promise to get sober that morning, while she was breaking down like that. It took an hour to disarm the situation. I bandaged her arms. I pulled the hundred-dollar bill from my wallet, laid it on the kitchen table and asked her,

“What can you get for this?”",1531340070.0

I’ve had a solid 6 years using, followed up by being sober three years. I was heavy into oxy, like 3-500 mg daily at my worst.  On my 1096th day sober (3 years exactly) I treated myself to 60mg and was absolutely floored... overdid it a little prolly but I didn’t vomit so I couldn’t care less. Anyways fast forward 3 months and I’m currently shooting 1-2g of some of the finest ecp the Midwest has to offer.  Things started falling apart, as my girlfriend and I live and use together.  Basically I’m paying for two drug habits at once because I love my girlfriend, but her disease had progressed far beyond mine before we met, and it gets to life and death with her.. narcaned her twice in the past month. Deep down I know that she understands the consequences of what will happen if we continue to use, but cannot testify for her (or any addict) that she will hold the value of our relationship above all else.. lol.  So here’s the deal: been on vacation for the past week, flew cross country to an island without any fucking dope, (dopesick in airport security? fucking sucks) actually forgot I had a loaded 9mm clip in my backpack and got held up for a bit lmfao but got thru security none the less. did a sub taper from 8-1mg and staying at 1mg daily.. we’re going to be home by this time tomorrow and despite feeling back to normal, I can’t resist the temptation of picking up for one more night... since we would both prolly end up using, the chances of a single use turning full on relapse are greater.  I just want to hear what it’s like from y’all experience in these situations.. typically my first use after a break is overwhelming and I won’t wanna do it again the next day.. but I’m worried my tolerance won’t be as low as it was “those other times” and that I’ll slip right back into oblivion..also heroin.  

Will post dope porn if I follow through.. probably won’t post sub porn if I don’t.

TLDR:  Clean for a week, really want to get a few hits for my first night back.  How hot is the fire I’m playing with?",1531339724.0

In all the years I've smoked weed and done other recreational drugs(heroin, fent, carfent) and nothing even close to this has ever happened. Shit, of the 7 years I was doing HEROIN, I haven't ever overdosed or had ajy scares. But this... Some 'friends' showed up to smoke a blunt & chill, whatever. So after we smoke, I get out of the car to say my goodbyes & whatever, right? I make it about 7, 8, maybe 9 complete steps before I completely lose my head. Like, it feels like my head detatches from my body. I fall face first into the ground, kapow. My head tries to come back for a minute, I sit up, rub my head and tell these people to help me to my apartment. They set me against the corner of the building, where I immediately lose my head again. It was the strangest feeling, like getting lightheaded, but everything just floated away. I cannot explain the feeling exactly... In short, they just sat me down there, essentially overdosed(this blunt must have been laced, had to be! Right?) and was about to just leave me. Thank GOD that my dude Gwee was outside on the phone, he was the first one really there. Then Bleu, she said she had a gut feeling to go out & get some fresh air & saw our neighbor down there, so she runs on out. Then comes Link  followed by Tweety and they all bring me inside. I was blue, white, whatever- pissed myself, talking nonsense and just completely out of it. All I remember is coming to sitting on the toilet, holding my head. But I came back and I'm fine. Moral of the story is, don't smoke blunts with strangers.

Then the media would talk about how all the “insulin addicts” are a victim of this evil drug insulin, that has the power to turn people into homeless prostitutes, and that there is an “insulin epidemic” and that all the “insulin addicts” need “treatment” for their “insulin use disorder”, “for their own good” of course.

They would further blame the insulin itself, not the prohibition of insulin, for all the problems caused by the prohibition of insulin, which would lead to an even harder crackdown on insulin, which would make things even worse, so they would crackdown on insulin even harder, and things would get even worse, so they’d crackdown on insulin again even harder, and things would continue to get worse and worse.

And this cycle would continue and continue and continue, all because the effects of the prohibition of insulin are being blamed on insulin itself.

This is EXACTLY what has happened with opiates.

When opiates were completely legal and over the counter like insulin - which they were for thousands of years since the beginning of time up until March 1, 1915 when the 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act went into effect - people who took opiates lived completely normal lives just like people who take insulin today.

It is time to end the prohibition of opiates and restore our right as individuals to choose our own medicine.

Ive been writing down daily about my experiences documenting both high and low, and posted key events as a way to vent. Although private, I wanted to share my troubles in hopes thatll itll help others in their own troubles.

This is a continuation from where I left off. 

This isnt a story with characters based on true events, or one bigger than life tale where the main character does all sorts of cool shit  bendin the fuckin heavens. These are real experiences that brought a whole lot of real pain, misery, and sorrows. Im not a scholar, but Im not completely stupid. Im a 22 year old, who made the wrong choices, pushin weight, and puttin love and trust in the wrong people.  Ive lost my home, expensive cars, a lot of family and friends. All because two people tried to be together even when it felt like the world, like shit even the universe, did everything in its power to stop it. This aint a tale bagging on a woman who ""wronged"" me or meant to make yall feel resentment towards any one that has. I ask that you try to be understanding because no one is perfect, were all human, we fuck up , we do bad shit , we love, we hurt. 

Sry if im ramblin I just want it to be known, there aint no hero, no villians, just regular people experiencing life and all its challenges

Im sitting there more upset about losing the only two things ive had strong emotions for.  Im in the back of the car just feelin a mix of emotions like anger, neglect, and just straight up hurting. The ride to the first holdin cell went by fast, and once I laid down it started. All these negative thoughts eating at me, like what is she doin? Who is she with? Why arent I good enough to be with ? Why cant she want me like she does the drugs? 

Just a bunch of shit like that, it was torment man but in retrospect; feeling all those emotions and thoughts with no drugs to supress them, made me deal with them head on. I felt it, I couldn't ignore it any more. At the time It honestly felt like it was tearing at my spirit, but I know now it was just strengthening it.

I eventually fall asleep, and get awoken by some dude with a tiny penis and herded onto a bus to go downtown. Honestly nothing interesting happens i just go to county , get a PR bond and get out.  But the like 2 days in there just let me think and this moment was a key moment because I began to detach myself from her. I pretty much was in denial about our relationship, I couldnt accept it falling apart until I was forced to reflect.  Even though my life was slowly falling apart , at the time I felt there is no life without her. I made one person my reason for purpose and being.   

  ( There aint nothin wrong with love, but once your life is dependant on another you done fucked up. Experience yalls lives together. Itll save u some ache)

I get released at like 3am, straight up looking like a vato. No cash no phone nothing. I bum a cigg and start walkin, kind of mindless and this dude comes up to me showing me his knife. Im already in the worst of moods and tell this dude i dont want to buy his knife and just push him aside.  I didnt know he was trying to rob me till later and i felt really bad because of how rude i was. 

What carried on the next few months was basically like we were bleeding out. She actually found my dog and returned him and ill forever be grateful. But id message her always hoping for a reply and when i would get one, itd be short. It hurt. So bad. On top of having to go to probation and out patient rehab 2x a week it crushed me slowly. She had already been seeing other people, and entertaining( if you can call it that) me occasionally.  Ima leave it at that.

My father let me move in to get on my feet. I never thought a person could constantly think about someone every hour of the day. Wondering if shes okay, if shes thinking of me when songs we listened to came on, or if when a beatle drove by, shed fight the instict to turn and punch me. I picked up drinking because of drug tests, and sleeping pills/ prescription meds. My schedule before i got a job would be to wake up popp some meds to pass back out. Repeat. I couldnt physically or mentally do it. When i got a job, i was on autopilot. 

I dont remember much of the months after, I wasnt really living, just existing. I wouldn't talk to any females or barely hang with friends.  Except one, now im hesitating to even mention her or our relationship but she was a good friend.

A 

Strictly platonic, shed send me pictures tagg me in shit, like any one of my brothers would. To be honest im really bad at flirting or knowing when to pick up on social cues ( ex. Guy tryna rob me) 
I enjoyed her company, but B was always on my mind and my heart never stopped loving her. 

( oh btw my ex was in jail for 4 months n i didnt know. Id send her messages every now and then telling her i loved her andhope shes okay) 

I grew close to A, but i was kinda a mess and was in no position to even get into a relationship. I realized the moment A and I are driving just gettin chickfila. I did something selfish, I held her hand. But I never onced looked over, cos in my mind, for a split second, i had my partner in crime, my best friend, my angel kitty, right back by my side. 

I wouldnt really show much affection after that. I couldnt use her as a replacement. She meant alot to me and helped me deal with each day a bit better. The feelings did grow but I never asked her to be more than friends. We were essentially a couple but i was just to scared shitless to start again.  

Around January of this year, we were doin what we usually do chillin, killin, bein villians n my homie invites us to her crib. Now at this point probation has me pretty much clean. I would just take adderall. I was given more freedom and would only have to come to probation 1x a week giving me thursdays go fuck off wifh A. So i ask slam to get us "" w h i t e "" because i haven't shot up anything in a while and didnt really have an urger to dl anything else. Quick high and A could snort ( didnt like me shooting too) i arrive at slams and i pay her 20 and she hands me a bag of white powder. I thought shit this is ""skimpy but fuck it""  i make a shot put as much as I normally do for a shot of C O K E. So the second i shoot it up i dont hear no bells no sound nothing i just get warm and im like ""T h i s i s n t c o-""  and i really dont understand whats going on im just not cognitive. Im like wtf is happening lol. And trying to come to but i cant. I cant see or interact with thd world around me and i just feel my face vibrating. I eventually come to and im like"" slam i meant coke my b""  n theyre lookin at me like im crazy cos A is slapping me trying to keep me from noddin cos i wasnt respondin and just am okay the next few minutes. 

So i shouldve been careful and told A it fr fr wasnt coke but i forgot. Were chillin im nodding hardcore like i sit in couch and hug A being like a pet. She asks for a line I pull out the bag of coke and tell her hurry. Being in my state of mind I didnt even realize what I did.

She comes back normal, and I just lift her arm up to hug me n shit. But i notice she isnt doing it as hard as she was. I was like ""k"" and kept readjusting her arm for her. I get frustrated and finally look up bout to literally throw a fit and deck this bitch. Jk but i look up and its like pulp fiction.

The look in her face is one im very familiar with. Im looking up and her green eyes are focused on me, and my probably over exagerrated expression. It felt like we were starin at each other like retards for a good minute, but the instant her eyes lost focus, I felt mine widen up and my jaw slightly drop kinda like when youre bout to say
 "" o h sh i t n o ""   

I felt my blood rush, and my mind snap back to reality, like straight up on an instinctual level. I was fuckin nodded like Icouldn't move not even 30 seconds ago, like legit paralyzed. But the seriousness of the situation triggered an adrenaline rush or some shit.  Without a thought ,i went from having my head on her lap with her arm over me, to moving my arm around her back to support her as she became jelly and sliding my feet off the couch for better support n shit.  

So like this literally happened in a 10 second time frame. Like my friend hasnt noticed what even was beginning to happen. She was barely speaking or breathing and each second that passed  just increased my anxiety. Because each second brought me closer to the realization that she wasnt going to make it.

I was panicking internally, trying to plan what to do, where the nearezt hospital was, where my keys are , how many compressions for CPR , how many breaths.  My mind was all fucked, man the life was fading from her and I tried everything to grab on to just a lil bit of it.
I was dead ass crying fr fr. I picked her up, as slam opened the door , and car door.  All i could fuckin say was 
"" please dont leave me too.""

Not long after I uprooted my life and moved across the world (not to break the rules, I'll be vague and just say a big city in Taiwan). 

I've always known the good stuff is around but hard to find since its not the national DOCs of ice and K. I'm not a fan of either. 

The last few months have been hard and I've increasingly craved the sweet release of a fat shot. So going through a heavy bout of depression I drive by this seedy 'under the bridge' Park area that has always stuck out to me. Shady guys walking around obviously doing something they aren't supposed to. Went back to American assumptions and thought ""ah, these are definitely junkies or tweakers or something of the sort. I'll go check it out."" 

Being non-asian I immediately get attention of everyone I cross paths with. ""Not so weird,"" I think, as I'm used to stares being a foreigner. So I just walk around trying to think of the right slang to use in Chinese etc. I get to an elevated path leading to a dark isolated pavilion. I pass a dude that I almost ask but instead just say hello. I get to the pavilion and start rethinking all this. Then I turn around to see dude I just said hi to heading my way. Oh he's getting close. What should I say...hmm...ok, he's standing very close to me..weird. ""How's it going?"" I say....BAM aaaaand he's grabbing my dick and trying to kiss me. I jump back nearly over the railing in terror. ""Whoa guy, I'm not gay."" He starts apologizing. Then asks wtf am I doing here in the gay hookup area. Ohhhhhhh. I tell him why and he schools me on the fact that this isn't the west. There are no places you can just go score at here. You have to know someone who knows someone etc. Says he knows nobody who's into the good stuff but lots of gays like to get tweaked out or do some k before doing the nasty and offers to take me around to ask the other gay guys. Kind offer but no thanks. Back to my boring Suboxone plus zanies.

So of course I have heard about kratom and it's benefits at least as far was withdrawing is concerned.

If so, is there a certain type I need to for this purpose?

So most of you are aware of all the fent in a lot of various continents, which has in a lot of them nearly or fully replaced the actual heroin they had prior. And a smaller but still pretty big amount of you know it's fent that is being made in meth lab style operations in the jungles on south american countries, as well as china, which irdk how they do it, and wouldn't surprise me if they were able to use actual lab equipment (sort of like how on breaking bad they first did their cooks pretty ghetto-ly, in an old RV, and latter on got a physical location with all the equipment that a pharmaceutical company would have/use), either in a static lab spot like I mentioned in parenthesis that the main characters of BB got to utilize, or potentially the same type of jungle style clandestine operations done by imo the majority of illicit manufacturers of these types of drugs. Hell I've even heard of those producing MDMA in the netherlands are creating environmental hazards by dumping their hazardous waste products from their 'cook's', and littering as well, in the forests of the area, tho all i kept thinking while watching the vid/show/i forget what it was on... like: ""jesus fuck if your govt. just legalized that already, this shit'd stop nearly overnight!""

Ugh, I'm sorry for the tangent, I'm tryna do better, and ik you've prob heard me say that a trillion times only for me to go back on my word, but I really am, its just hard for me.

**MAIN POST**
==========
Anyway, so I was reading various random wikipedia articles, as I often do for hours straight when stimmed, and even just sober too lol. So I was curious as to what class of drugs dextromethorphan belonged to, since I had seen somewhere the name of a drug called Levomethorphan or something like that, and it said it was an opioid or opiate, i forget too. So I google it, and find a wiki page that is helping clear up my inquiries. The article that had sparked this idea is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphinan). 

Specifically this quote from it: ""Of the major naturally occurring opiates of the morphinan type—morphine, codeine and thebaine—thebaine has no therapeutic properties (it causes seizures in mammals), but it provides a low-cost feedstock for the industrial production of at least four semi-synthetic opiate agonists, including hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, and, perhaps more significantly, the opioid antagonist naloxone."" 

Lastly, this quote...: ""The substitution of certain bulky groups on nitrogen 17 converts an opioid agonist into an opioid antagonist, the most important of which is naloxone, a non-selective opioid antagonist with no opioid agonist properties whatsoever. Additionally, substitution of certain very bulky groups on carbon 6 converts naloxone into a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist with no centrally-selective antagonist properties (naloxegol).""

Now idk how difficult it'd be to clandestinely produce naloxone, and even if possible, idk if it'd be possible to somehow make it either like not potent enough so it's not strong enough to push out the opioids from the ODing individual's receptors... or like too potent, where at the least, the tiniest bit brings them back, but in violent PWDs, or somehow could have some worse effects? Irdk just guessing. Mainly due to the greedy af pharma companies trying to think ""Hey look a crisis, lets try and exploit it since nobody can just not use the stuff, since even if they don't use, its more than likely someone they're closed to does, or used to and incase they lapse or relapse, narcan's there... and imo it's always better to have something that goes unused, vs. needing something that's not there. 

**So yeah, what'd'you guy's think?** I'd love to hear from the more chemistry/science oriented members the best obv., but in general... if possible, and hopefully not requiring expensive and/or closely-monitored precursors, and/or expensive lab equipment mixed with a good working knowledge of drug synths, and chemistry... we could be making our own narcan to give to friends and ppl we see outside who look as if it might save their life later today with how high they seem. 

I also thought that IF its possible, however requires most if not all of the criteria I hoped that it wouldn't, than perhaps the clandestine chemists making fent and it's analogs can make a bunch of narcan to ship with it, so their dealers under them, and so on, and so forth, can make it safer for themselves when selling fent or fent cut dope, as they're making sure they got narcan, which imo could mitigate the risk of at least a fatal OD, which could easily get the dboy, unjustly AF I might add (but i'm not gonna rant about it like I did b4 in over 10,000 chars, which ik since that's the post limit here lmao), a fucking murder charge! 

I've already deleted more than 7 long tangential off-topic paragraphs from this post, and am ending this here and now, tho it still seems pretty long needlessly... at least i figure it's not way too long or unpostably long lol.

Wish me luck.,"Like it says, nothing special. You all know how it goes. Finally had a good thing going for about 8 months. Got off whatever pills I could get a hold of and used kratom. It was great. Bought it online for cheap. it helped me out so much. Took away cravings, gave me some motivation and energy at work. It was still something I had to take everyday to not feel sick, but I'm ok with that for now, it was my mantainence. 

But of course I found a fake Roxie connect thru a guy I worked with. Then once a week turned into everyday after a month or two. It's been about 4 months with this run. I've fucked myself financially more than I'd like to admit. I'm sure you all can imagine, late on car payment, bills a month behind, scrambling for rent. The whole nine yards. This a just a quck rundown as I think a few of you have probably been on the path I am on at some point. It sucks, but it's my own fault. 

Luckily I've been tapering down basically because money is so tight. So I have that going for me. Don't have much in the way of comfort meds due to money right now unfortunately. I have some lope, bud, and a quarter of a sub,  Roughly 2mg. No days off, but working some half days compared to my usual 12+hr days. It's gonna suck, but I just accepted a new job offer. I start in 2 weeks, so I want to be clean and ready. I think it will be good for me. I'm still working my current job till then. So I figure if I'm gonna have to be a sick zombie at work, might at we'll be seeing my last 2 weeks when it doesn't matter what I do.

well 6 months later i decided i was tired of having to force out concrete rabbit shits the size of baseballs and having to spend hella cash on tar when i decided ""ehh fuck it. ima give myself a break""

first off, no real cravings so that wasnt a problem. woke up after not doing tar that night and got what i call the ""hot-colds"", where your body overheats and you get all sweaty so then you cool off and now your cold as fuck.

also i had the strong desire to do nothing but lay in bed and watch shit on tv/my phone. anxiety at this time was very high to the point where i felt it in my chest, along with fucking RESTLESS ass legs almost as bad as when i tripped off hella benadryl in 8th grade...

welp, its been 5 or 6 days and ive had kratom and phenibut for 3, and i still have the hot colds and restless legs but no anxiety, still no cravings. just been smokin weed, chillin, doin me.

and god damn i was smacked off pheni and hit up hella bitches to fuck and i probably done busted bout 4 nuts in one day, i was so damn horny i even got me morning wood back again.

If I did, I'd have two options. Derrick or Tim. Derrick skims from the top, and Tim has a family and I'm pretty sure he's struggling to stay clean. My proposing that we pick up product would be enough to push him to break his sobriety if he hasn't already. Even if he did break his sobriety, I wouldn't judge him.. I should call him tomorrow just to catch up with him and remind him how well subs work for me.

A while back I was speaking to Tim about being on subs and he said that hearing such reassured him, made him feel better about staying the course. We both deviated back into dope not long after and thus I obviously did not follow through. Still, I was on subs for two weeks to that point and living proof that I was physically fine.

&nbsp;

Briefly, I owe Derrick $10 but I've chosen to make him wait. Why not? He inconvenienced me with the spice that was *not* of Jewish origin. Even when he paid me back he was short a single bag and 3/4 bags were skimpy. I could just indefinitely avoid giving him the $10 he thinks I owe him but frankly if giving him $10 prevents him from inquiring about it, or blabbing off about me owing him $10 to his family then it's money somewhat well spent.

How exactly did I come into owing him $10? One night I wanted to spend $20 on dope, and didn't feel like going to the ATM to get another $10 that night. I insisted on getting $20 worth and he insisted that I could take my time owing him $10 more, so he inevitably provided me with a $30 half. Now he has been waiting, he should've listened to me. I don't need to build good will with him though because I don't plan on doing anymore business with him. Therefore I haven't had a reason to rush. 

&nbsp;

Back to my buddy Tim; he's the only person I'd ever buy dope through going forward but I don't plan on buying dope anymore. Something just clicked last time I finished a batch of dope. I know what it would feel like and for some odd reason I'm able to think rationally about how it would be a waste of money. Granted having subs are a major factor, but then I think. 

Would I buy dope if I had ran out of subs and couldn't get more subs right away?

I don't know, but I do know that whenever I reach the bottom of the barrel with subs, I preempt the potential discomfort by bringing myself to the lowest bearable dose which has the effect of up to doubling the mount of days I have left. Surely going to a doctor would be simpler. I've actively chosen not to do that at this time. 

&nbsp;

Can I do dope tomorrow? Sure. The instant my direct deposit arrives I can reach out to a douch nozzle and have product within 1-6 hours or I can reach out to Tim, stick my bike in his car at 9pm and pick up the junk within the 15 minutes it takes him to drive to the 'hood. Along the way we'd tell stories, exchange laughs, and discuss ""close calls"" with family. From there he would drop me off at a service road that lines up with my homeward bound destination, we'd wish each other well, possible use the ""L"" word and part ways. Well perhaps he'd wait an extra minute while I attach the wheels to my bike, wouldn't want me to get mugged for being ill prepared to take flight.

err...**trigger warning**..
Then I would go home, get to my formica desk, pour out two to three bags, chop the ECP up with a card, make it into a series of smaller lines (optimal nasal interface!) and then line up the strizzle, taking care to bring it to the back of my nose -- wouldn't want those nose hairs stealing my dope! Then finally, a series of sniffs, not too hard.. we don't wanna cough up our ECP and then finally sit back -- and do the very same thing I'd be doing if I didn't have the dope.

So you know, why bother? After a day or two of this I would either buy a little more or run out. At which point I would wake up feeling moderate to bleh and would resume my Suboxone consumption except at a higher dose than what I was taking the day before I bought dope.

**Note for active users: Don't forget about the U shaped straw apparatus to promote lung health!**

&nbsp;

Tomorrow I'll only see Dbag, he who giveth spice bags. I'll give him the ten dollars he believes I owe him despite my more logical perceptions, though I might be a little biased. Maybe he'll ask me if I want dope, maybe he'll even say ""I already have it on hand, no need to wait"" (for once). Fuck that shit. Steady as I go, I really want to stay the course. The subs keep me from getting sick despite my recent past decisions to do dope which inevitably causes me to feel sick.

&nbsp;

I already know what I need and want:

- More weed, the last harvest was a bit dry.. kinda ran out of nutrients early. Regardless, all weed I have or have access to is good for the soul.

- Things for my turtles. I'm thinking about building them bunk beds so they'll have more room for activities!

- Bike parts. I lost my rear mudflap when I bought dope with Tim. I need a new one otherwise I'll continue to get a rooster tail of mud on my back when I bike in the rain.

If you look at my post from a month ago, I went on a trip with my friends after a 24 day break from opiates. I had no clue it was 24 days. I thought it was like 2 weeks. 

The first night of the trip, I took 120mg of oxy over the span of like 2 hours, so I thought my tolerance didnt drop I just got a good high. Boy was I wrong. 

The second night I took 120mg at once, I was at dinner with my family and I started getting so fucking high, the nausea overcame me and I couldnt keep my eyes open. I ran to the bathroom and puked my guts out hoping i’d feel better. I stayed in the bathroom puking for like 10 minutes, then made my way back to the dinner table. 

I was still high as fuck, trying my hardest to look normal, but I kept nodding out & started to feel nauseous again & started sweating. I told everyone I didnt feel good and had my homies take me back to my room. I was barely able to walk straight, they said I was pale as fuck. I threw up in my bathroom, and passed out on my bed. My friends were making sure I was breathing and stayed in the room with me. Then I blacked out. 

I have no recollection of the rest of that night- the rest is shit my friends told me. I guess throughout the night I would wake up, and just do some dumb shit. It was like I was blacked out drunk. Sounding delirious, doing some stupid ass shit. I guess I would wake up, jump out of bed, do some weird shit and go right back to bed. For example, I was trying to recreate the thing from Saints Row 3 where you jump in the car window. 😂 and was doing some “hammerhead dance”. I would wake up and say some random shit, for example I woke up from sound sleep and said “He wants $500 but you can talk him down to $250” no one knew what I was talking about. 

I woke up the next morning, with a shitload of nausea, and a pounding headache. My friends were suprised I made it through the night, but they were helping the shit out of me. They were making sure I was sleeping on my side incase I threw up, put a cold towel on my head, etc. 

Did I OD? I wish I realized how long my break was, I wouldve prevented this. my tolerance was dropped, the next night I took 70mg and was high as fuck. ",1531272771.0

When my family found out they gave me two choices, get help or get out. I chose to get out. I left home with a backpack, a few tee shirts and 50 dollars. I was worried they would try to find me if I stayed gone, so I spent most of the money on a bus ticket down the coast, and of course a bag of dope. In high school I was a cheerleader and an honor roll student, even while getting high, but moving to the new city let me reinvent myself with no shame. I slept in parks and panhandled. 

“Mr Fantastic’ found me dope sick in a park. He offered me a front, and I made the mistake of getting into his car, a brand new Mercedes. He started driving to “get the dope.” Once we got on the interstate I realized something was wrong. He passed me a gram of tar. I was so terrified that I decided to just tune everything out. I got high as a kite and fell asleep. He took me to a motel room, ironically in the city I originally came from. He kept me trapped in a motel room, kept me incredibly high, beat the shit out of me, raped me, and found wealthy white businessmen online to sleep with me at high end hotels for large amounts of money. He even advertised that I was 16 on certain sites. I grew up sheltered in an upper middle class neighborhood, and I went to private school. The fact that all these men, men who reminded me of my friends parents, were paying to sleep with a strung out, pimped out, teenager shocked me.

Typically he would book a few rooms in a four star hotel, and a few suites in some shit box hotel for us to live in. There were five of us working girls, him, and and an older girl who didn’t work anymore but helped him manage us and sell drugs. He had everything from cocaine to crack to ecstasy to heroin to 30s to Xanax to weed. Some was for us, a little he sold, but most was actually being stored for whatever organization he was working for. 

I wasn’t even shooting up yet. I smoked black tar, blew massive lines of coke, and took Xanax everyday. I thought I was trapped, that I would never leave. Luckily I got out, eventually.

Idk why I’m writing all this. I still get high but now a days I’m very secretive about it, I have to be. No one in my life knows about my past. I have a good job as a promo model/bottle service girl and a swanky apartment, but I lie to everyone about myself. I’m only 21 but I feel like I’m 50. It feels good to write the truth. Sorry it’s a novel, lmk if you want more.

(Long),"So, I am posting via mobile because I had pawned my laptop in the past, and now I'm down to an old phone. I sold my phone too. 

I have been an avid lurker for the last year or two, and I finally grew the nuts to make an account. I almost made my name oxycodone30mgs to poke fun at gangsta, but decided otherwise. What originally made me fascinated with this sub was Morbo's stories. Man do I miss those. I will try to stop babbling now, and get to my story. 

I ""woke up"" at 7:04 a.m. to a phone call from my SO who was sick of my shit and had moved out a week prior. I use quotation marks because we all know how someone sleeps on hour 36 of withdrawal from a daily 500-600 mg oxycodone habit. How do I afford this you ask. Well, I don't. Not well at least. 

I work a fairly decent job, but of course I am in loads of debt and always broke. I probably would have switched to dope a while ago, but for some reason I haven't been able to find it, and truthfully haven't looked very hard because I've been trying to kick for the last year. The weekly cycle we all know. Sober for a week. Using for three weeks. Rinse and repeat. Oddly enough my tolerance does drop, but skyrockets after three days of dosing too often and wasting a load of blues knowing that I need to wait until my high fades. Well, I was back to the point of needing four blues to even get well. 

After waking I had decided that I was too sick to even think about hustling. After three more hours I said fuck it. Started finding any possession I could imagine the pawn shop would take. On my way to the pawn shop I stopped at a cash advance place. That was a fiasco, but after two hours I walked away with two hundred dollars and a 519% interest rate. Genius I know. But the shaking and stretching did not stop the entire time I was in there. 

I immediately call my guy and begin to speed his way. At the first red light I toss the water out of my paper cup knowing that I might puke up the candy I just ate at the cash advance shop. Sure enough I begin to violently puke into the cup. Luckily not all in my lap. I pour out the cup at a red light and continue to puke. 

I finally reach the destination after the longest four hour ride that was actually twenty minutes of my life. To my delight, he was pulling in at the same time I was! He handed me my six and a half blues in my five dollar bill that was my change. Of course my guy that sells for 25 was MIA. He even swapped three of the E8's for an a215, alg, and a k9. I have nothing against e8's but there had been too many around to feel good about the legitimacy of them. 

I immediately snort 3 1/2 and wait in the parking lot to not feel too nauseous to drive. Viola. I head to the pawn shop. 

They look over my plethora of items and I was so stoked to hear that my old ass laptop would be bringing in 70 bucks. Well, of course the new girls computer shuts down and the manager comes to help. She tells me that since my windows 7 isn't authentic that they won't take it. Fuck. Well I still scraped up and extra 90 so three more blues for me. 

I make it home finally and am all smiles. 

Until the sickness returns...


If you're it this far cheers! I'm happy to have finally joined.

Never used to happen before.","Hey all, ok so I got a question. And im just curious if this has happened to anyone else. So ive been doing dope now for ten years. Started shooting like 4yrs ago. The only time I would get a bump or rash after a shot, was when I missed. 

Fast forward to now. I've been doing just fent (dope barely touches me anymore) for the last 2-3yrs.  I never get a rash from missing a fent shot. Sometimes a little painful bump but thats about it. Now I rarely do anything but my dudes fent, but theres been a few times he was dry an I had to see one of my backups. They usually either have dope or a fent/dope mix. But every time I do something that has any dope in it at all.. I get a bumpy kinda rash near where I did my shot. This happens even if I don't miss any of my shot. It has happened literally the last 20-30 times I did something with dope in it. And it's not just 1 kind from 1 person. Ive tried a ton of diff kinds from 3 diff ppl and it just happens everytime there's dope in it. But I used to shoot dope for years with no issues, and stuff would only pop up when I would miss. So i'm confused why this is happening now. Has anyone else had this happen to them? ",1531260193.0

But occasionally, later that day or the next day after use I will get like a dryness and flakey skin on my face around my nose (left and right of the nostrils, right above where my mustache grows. Also the inner rim of my nostrils on the septum aspect can get scabbed over).

Before anyone says levamisole, I'm quite sure that's not it. I've seen the pictures of what can happen to the skin with levamisole, and there is no purple discoloration or sloughing off of the tissue or anything beyond just superficial, like there are no corresponding immune system depletion symptoms, or anything else that would indicate levamisole. Also I use cocaine infrequently, and have never had this occur while smoking crack or going on a coke binge. 

It basically seems to happen once in a great while, and only affects those small areas of skin on the face for some reason, doesn't mess with any other areas of my body. I'm guessing it's a cut in the coke or dope. Just curious if I'm the only one, or if anyone else might be familiar with what I'm talking about. I don't expect anyone to know exactly what the cause is, but it would be great to hear it's not just me and that some other people have experienced this. It would be nice to know I'm not just crazy or missing something obvious. It would also be great to know if anyone might have any insight into this why this might occur. 

BTW, I don't think it has anything to do with itching or scratching, as I don't fuck with my face when high, I do scratch the shit out of every other part of my body though, and enjoy every minute. The way the skin gets scratched raw is way different than what I'm talking about here though.

I actually haven’t used in quite a while so I probably shouldn’t have done as many shots as I did that day. Regardless, I made a total ass of myself, one of my coworkers had to pick up my slack and my “cool” boss had a talk with me after work and said I need to get my shit together because if any other manager would have been there I’d have been canned. The whole thing is a blur to me. I told him I was tired. What an obvious bs excuse. My KM at least for sure knows what was up. I’m so ashamed and scared to go back into work tomorrow. I don’t think I’m gonna be fired but at the same time I have nothing to say. No excuse to give. I mean fuck, I’ve been trying so hard to demonstrate how bad I want to move up and then this happens. I’m too embarrassed to even apologize. I can’t admit the truth. It will only Hirt my situation. I’m so goddamn on point 97% of the time. I just feel like such an ass. What can I even say at this point? 

I’m anemic. I took a Xanax because I’ve been so stressed and dealing with death lately. You got me I’m an addict and I slipped up. I know they’re obvious but the scars on my arm are old as fuck. And they are. Super faded track marks I can never get rid of. 

I’m sorry guys. I’m a mess right now. I don’t really think I’m seeking answers I just needed to vent because there’s literally no one I can talk to about this. No one at my job will be forgiving. At least right now. 

I’m done. 

EDIT/UPDATE:

First, you guys are awesome. Thank all of you for the solid advice. I was a mess before work. It actually went ok. I inevitably had to have a talk with my boss but I said I was fucked up saturday, and I’m sorry and embarrassed. He said he appreciated the honesty and asked if I needed help with anything. I said no I’m just going through some personal shit (some of which he knows about). We talked a bit and he proceeded to tell me about the good things I do do, and said if something like this happens again, especially without warning I could face being fired. Anyways. It’ll be ok.

Needles.

I turned seventeen the summer of 2003, between junior and senior years. My friends and I all smoked weed. We had taken Xanax, Percocet, Hydrocodone, mushrooms, ecstasy, acid and all those kinds of intermediate level drugs. That summer this guy popped up and started chilling with all of us and had access to all these crazy, hard drugs, and not one of us had ever seen him before. It was weird because he lived in the heart of uptown. We should have known him. None of us had even heard of him. He said his name was John.

He was a year older than I was and put off the vibe that his parents might have kept him chained to the water heater in the basement or something. Seriously. They must have recognized the absence of any moral sensibility. I used to watch him inject rats full of strange chemicals he carried in a Pink Floyd lunch box and throw them on the floor to writhe around and vomit as they died. There were rings around his eyes and he had this weird walk and speech, like he was not able to relate to other people’s emotions. I always picture him in my mind with a dark purple scar over his eye brow ridge, like Frankenstein or the newly drooling and shuffling recipient of a crudely performed lobotomy.

Anyway. He had this weird thing where he’d only mention what drugs he had over the phone if they were disguised as people’s names. If Dennis was in town, then there was some Demerol in his possession. He liked bottles of phenobarbital and referred to them as Barbara. Val, of course, was valium, and you get the idea. Sometime, right before I turned seventeen, he called me up. He said his friend Dillon was in town, but I didn’t know what that meant. So, we met up.

I walked a few blocks up to the park. Middle aged housewives and college aged kids ran wearing spandex and headphones around the track. Beams of the sun’s last light shone through the canopy of Live Oak limbs. A gaggle of geese squawked after an old man throwing pieces of bread by the mote of brown water around the golf course. Some kids screamed on the playground. Their mothers watched. John stood on the asphalt where the runners ran. He was hunched over and when the runners ran around him, they would turn around like angry deaf people wearing their headphones and scowl at him for standing in their way. Pretty much any place in the 350 acres of park would have been a better place to stand than where he was, but I walked up to him anyway.

He must have heard me, because he turned around and tried to smile. It was an unnatural and ghastly display of teeth, and the awkward expression of his face didn’t help, like he was expecting some visual cue from me that would show him I was satisfied with this display of humanity, like he was looking to see that I believed him to be one of us. Mosquitos and other summer evening bugs buzzed in the bushes and grass around us. Another woman ran around us, pivoting her head on her neck as she passed to keep looking at us.

“What do you have?”

“I said Dillon is in town. From now on, when I say Dillon, I’m telling you that I have Dilaudid.”

“What’s Dilaudid?”

“Dilaudid is Hydromorphone. I hear that they’re eight times stronger than morphine.”

“Sh\*t. That’s all you had to say. How much for one?”

“Well I have k4s. They’re four milligrams a piece. I’m selling them ten dollars a piece.”

I had a hundred bucks. “How many do you have?”

“I have four right now.”

“Here’s forty bucks.” He pulled a balled-up sandwich bag from his pocket and poured them into his open palm. He held them close to my nose.

“See the k4?” A woman with hard face and dark freckles ran by us. She pivoted her head to look at us and saw exactly what we were doing. We kept talking.

“How do you do them?”

“You can snort them or eat them, but they’re really for shooting.”

“I don’t know how to hit a vein.”

“Just IM them.”

“What?”

“Intramuscular injections. Shoot it into your muscle. Skin pop it.”

“Where?” John pulled the back of his sleeve up. He flexed his triceps and turned the back of his arm out towards me. Then, he stabbed an invisible needle into his triceps and used his thumb to push the invisible plunger down. Another couple of runners gawked as they ran by. Beads of summertime sweat formed on my lips and forehead. I slapped the massive chunk of steel he called a hand, said I would see him later and walked back towards my house.",1531239849.0

She was probably in her mid 20s-early 30s. She was leaning forward with her elbows on her knees and every so minutes she’d slip out of consciousness and slowly slump forward until her head was between her knees and her forearms were touching the floor. At one point she almost fell forward out of her seat, but the jolt woke her up and she managed to catch herself. I was sort of keeping an eye on her for any signs that she might be overdosing, but her skin tone was normal and she didn’t appear to be having trouble breathing, and every so often she’d perk up for 30 seconds or so before drifting off again. Even if she’d fallen out of her seat, she would not have been seriously hurt.

I didn’t really feel like there was anything I could do for her - the only thing I could think of was to maybe ask her where she was getting off the train so I could make sure she didn’t miss her stop. But I wasn’t sitting right next to her and I didn’t want to make her any more of a spectacle than she already was by calling out to her. At the same time, it just felt kind of cold and inhumane to watch her nearly passing out and falling on the floor over and over again, with half the train car staring at her the whole time.

I’m just wondering, if I’m in the same situation again is there anything I should do? I am not a user so I have no idea how she would be feeling about this situation and whether she’d appreciate someone asking if she needed help or whether it would just come across as nosy/condescending.",1531232922.0

I've been periodically using codeine for a year now, i stuck to my once a week rule for quite a while, until just a few months back, when i started using almost 3 times a week. The usual dose was 1200mg, but i soon upped that to 1500mg, since tolerance is a bitch (and before you start that codeine has a ceilling limit bullshit on me - just try using 500mg and 1500mg of codeine with antihistamines. You will see a difference clear as night and day) and those ammounts were enough for me to get quite dizzy and even slightly noddy. But i decided to try and cut off this shit once and for all, since my family found out about my use.

So i'm 3rd day in without any use, and all i feel is slightly irritable, a bit twitchy. Nose is a bit runny, but i have no diarrhea whatsoever, just a regular shit once or twice. I feel no urge to use whatsoever, but the fact that i'm having these mild symptoms doesn't encourage me to quit, since they make me believe that i was kinda doing it right, and making these breaks is what kept me from developing a physical addiction.

So, is it possible to use codeine once a week indefinitely and not develop a physical addiction? Or are the symptoms i mentioned are withdrawal symptoms already? Sincce codeine is the only thing in my life i look up to after a breakup from a 5 year relationship and crippling depression that followed.

Also - does withdrawal from short acting opiates set in 12 hours after last use? Because i feel no urge whatsoever to use the next day. None at all. Maybe these withdrawal symptoms are in my head completely?",1531232428.0

Anyways I'm about to buy 15 or so perc 10's and was wondering how long I should wait before taking them. I've heard mixed things, like that 20-30mg methadone isn't even strong enough to block the opioids. I've also heard to wait a couple days. Advice?

Anyways, the opioid agonists in kratom are mitragynine and 7-ohm-hydroxymitragynine. The problem with kratom is that it has other alkaloids that are also opioid ANTAGONISTS that block the good stuff. In the future, I can see a pure form of 7-ohm floating around, considering that it's roughly 17x the strength of morphine. Especially lf kratom becomes illegal, the pure mitra will be easier to ship. Also considering it's much easier to synthesize 7-ohm from a lab, rather than extracting and separating from pure kratom leaf. The downfall here is that if these chemicals start to form, kratom as a whole will certainly get shut down. I just think it's interesting, a new opioid could be in the market, whether in ""dope"" form or if big Pharma creates a pill. ",1531225966.0

I discovered something crucial tonight that seems so obvi in retrospect :/ about avoiding misses,"Howdy y'all. Just now as I was slam-dunking my last shot of the night (or so I thought), I discovered something crucial, something that's been causing misses for JJ knows how long, something that seems real obvious now looking back... and so I jumped on the laptop immediately to share with my fellow degenerates! (and I *never* do that)

For reference, here's my body type/physical info, this is more likely to happen to you too if you share some or all of these traits, I reckon. I am:

* young & female (29)
* skinny (95 lb) my whole life. eat whatever I want whenever i want (though i rarely want to)
* very little musculature too - just kind of boney :/
* poppin' vasculature. big ol' veins that visibly stick out, blue lines all over. (growing up i always thought it was so gross, esp my hands n feet)
* blood pressure issues like.. easily get headaches from too many pressure-changing motions such as sitting/standing up crouching leaning, palpably feel my pulse in body parts sometimes (just once it was my clit, that was a good day), etc ...

Soo I've been following the advice in [this thread by a medical professional here](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8d0xop/tips_on_iv_drug_safety_from_a_medical_professional/) with great results; it's really upped my IV game and I strongly recommend it, so please don't take this cautionary tale as a reason to discard that advice. (it used to be stickied!) In particular, the new habit I picked up from that post is pushing the plunger down with the tourney stilled tied on, as opposed to removing it after registering but before pushing in, and then leaving the needle in for 10 seconds after removing the tourney.

it also advocates registering multiple times during the process in order to make sure you're still in, as that's the best way to prevent misses. i was already doing that but it's important to note, for the story.

so, i registered beautifully, and looked to me like i was really solidly in there. as usual i kept double-checking as i pushed the plunger in, and each time it was a perfect register. but! some of the pushes began to have that familiar sting of a miss... but then i would double-check, perfect register, continue... and then on top of the stinging, a bump started to form, which is also typical of a miss. but sometimes it can just be a reaction, the key is whether it keeps growing in size... and sure enough, it did, it started getting mighty big... but still, perfect register...

at that point i called to my dear boyfriend to assist. told him to remove the tourney (was sticking my wrist so no spare hands) but then also to immediately squeeze my arm tight, making him my tourney. after some experimenting, here's what i discovered: if he loosened his grip, letting all the blood out, and then i pulled back on the plunger to make a vacuum, it would NOT register. then, holding the syringe and plunger exactly still in that position, i had him squeeze hard again, and sure enough as my arm swelled with blood, THAT caused the rig to register! (and register beautifully)

\*\*(TLDR) so what was happening was that after i had one little miss initially, it like, leaked i guess, into the space outside my veins, and the blood kept pooling there, and THAT POCKET is what i was registering on! see i'm still getting used to keeping the tourney on while i hit, and this is one clear consequence of that. what should've been just a little miss, I FED into a big ol' miss that was most if not all of my shot. ):\*\*

so there you go. i hope my weird story prevents this from happening to someone else. i wish i had takeaway advice/guideline to give you to prevent this but i'm still figuring that out myself. heck, if you have advice in that regard, lay it on me. your girl will just be over here, chillin' on the bed watching The Office with my hand in a little bucket of hot-ass water.

Forgot about them until just now -- about a week in total. Pulled out the open jar (skipped using a lid since the original plan was to pull it back out after a few hrs), and every last drop of liquid was gone.

I've had an opiate addiction for the past 5 years or so of my life, only this year did I finally start breaking the habit and now I've been on and off for about half a year. Started off with the yellow 10/325 narcos, and that progressed up to me eventually smoking tar like I do nowadays. (For all of you still at the weak painkiller phase, I suggest you quit now or you'll snowball into my position or maybe worse) 

Recently I've been having this unusual feeling when I smoke H... I'll take a hit and almost right after my full inhale of smoke, I'll get this lightheaded feeling in my head that lasts around 10 seconds or so, followed along by an amazing body high type rush that lasts another 10-15 seconds. Overall the feeling is highly enjoyable to me, almost similar to how it feels when you do a whip-it. Sometimes this feeling will be more intense, sometimes it won't be... Majority of the time it doesn't happen at all. 
What rose my concern to this feeling was just the other day when it happened, the lightheaded feeling i got was very intense, to the point where my head was swaying, my vision was getting blurry, and I had the feeling that I was actually losing control of how intense it got. Even tho it got to the point it did it was still a very enjoyable head and body rush I got... But I feel like this could be so intense one day that I  actually might black out... Idk if it would be just a simple blackout and I wake right up, or if I'd  asleep for awhile, or if I would OD... Or what... Idk. I figure this could be a result of holding my breath or maybe something to do with the way the foil is burning? But when it happens it's right after I'm done inhaling the smoke off the foil, not toward the end of me holding the hit in. That's what makes me skeptical...

When I smoke I usually don't smoke more then half a gram in one sitting so I'm not smoking a fuck ton or anything. Sometimes this feeling will happen after I've only smoked .2-.3...

Anyways I just wanted to make this post to see if anyone has had something similar happen to them, if so... Do you know what the cause may be?         

 Hope everyone's having a great day and thank you in advance for any input :) ",1531186075.0

All I did was buy an ounce of weed every week or so and I'd stop by Clifford's to smoke if I wasn't smoking elsewhere. So anyway, I'm at work when I get a text asking what I'm doing and then was asked to stop by his house after work.

&nbsp;

It seemed to be very important to Cliff to get me to stop by his house on my way home but he didn't say why. I felt stupid for mentioning when I would be getting off work. Hence, upon getting off work at 4pm, I walked, took a bus and walked some more. I didn't commute on a bike back then, so I was less inclined to take a longer detour to avoid Cliff's house.

&nbsp;

As I'm walking up my street with the intent of walking right past Cliff's house, I see Clifford standing in the street waiting to intercept me.


His fat ass knew I had good reason not to visit his house on the way home. So he greets me and hardly explains anything but insistently asks me to come into his house to speak to his mom. So he ushers me in and on to his mother's room where she is lying there in anticipation of my arrival. Cliff's mom asks me if I have $300 to lend out. I tried to act like I cared but almost immediately indicated that I did not have $300 to spare. Realistically, I was thinking of how unreliable Clifford was about paying me back any time he has thrown things on to the 7-11 counter when I was in the middle of purchasing my own shit. He'd toss things down and say ""I'll get you back later"", and he seldom or never got me back. When he did get me back it was in the form of energy drinks during his visit to the supermarket with his mom's money.

&nbsp;

Upon declining to help with the money she then asks me if I can ask my dad for the money. She even said that she would give me a post dated check that could be cashed the very day her Social Security direct deposit comes in when expected, supposedly like clockwork. Now, this is something I would feel very awkward about. What if I really did ask my dad? He would have to ask himself, what kind of people are these? This is not to say you're a bad person if you have needs in an emergency and ask to borrow money but in Cliff's mom's case, she's without the money that is needed because her son spent it and lied. Perhaps he spent it on pills, or perhaps he used to buy food after having spent other money that was earmarked for food. 

It's quite possible that he owed his mom money before a certain utility bill was due and promised he'd have that money on a certain day. He might say, ""Javier the bookie is delivering money I'm owed on Thursday night."" She would then ask, ""Did Javier come by?"" Cliff would say, ""he's coming at 9pm"" then 11pm, 12pm..then she'd fall asleep and wake up at 2am and ask again. Cliff would then say ""obviously not.""

&nbsp;

I cannot and will not have anyone in my house depend on a post dated check from Cliff's mom because shit happens. Maybe the bank has a ""fraud alert"" and locks out the account at an unexpected time. It won't be Cliff's mom's fault, she doesn't mean to screw people but the best excuses don't cover my expenses. Then, what I know now that I didn't know then is how Cliff takes money out of his mom's account as though it's his own. What if he got to the ATM before I or my dad got a chance to cash the check? 

Cliff is not an only child although he lives like one in his mom's dwelling. Why not ask her other son for the money? They already owed him a fuck ton of money, his mom promised to pay him back earlier than was possible because she bought Cliff's lies and planned around them Since they were just that, lies, Cliff's brother did not get his money back on time thereby making it impossible to get him to want to loan money to them in the future. He was at wit's end long before me, he also had the added benefit of not getting addicted to opiates.

&nbsp;

His recent requests for my attention n the past day have reminded me of this story. Yesterday he texted to hang out, offered me a line of drugs that I declined. Then he said he wanted to talk to me **""about making money this week too""**. Alarm bells go off, but at last I'm not gonna put myself in a position to be scammed. He then texted me this morning saying, **""Text me when u awake just for as second please. you're impossible to get a hold of these days!""** He then texted, **""I don't need anything or want to borrow anything so just text me when u have ur morning cup of java.""**

Fat chance. I don't want any stress to be imposed on my while I'm drinking my coffee. 

So I went on to indicate that I was at work, he then asked when I was working until. Two minutes later he texted, ""?""

&nbsp;

I'm curious what kind of scam he is brewing up when he said he had way for me to make money this week but I don't want to enter his dirty ass house. Maybe I'll just ask him what he means by ""make money.""

No time for Cliff's shit, I gotta clean my room because I have a girl coming over this week. Maybe I'll read some literature on flirtation and seduction as well, but I digress. I want to hear what he has to say about making money just for our amusement and make myself clear as possible while I'm at it. If I do go to speak to him, there is no better time to say, ""I'm working on staying clean and have been keeping myself occupied as a result."" Then I have to make up a reason I can't hang out tonight, ""I have work early tomorrow."" I'm not comfortable saying, ""your house is infested with bed bugs, I can't sit here. I only tolerated these filthy conditions because I was addicted to drugs."" 

&nbsp;

If I did speak to him, I would do it after my long bike ride and not before. If I visited him before a long bike ride, I'd have an excuse to not hang out but then he'd hand me his mom's debit card and ask me to pick up soda for him ""since it's on the way."" Better yet, the only thing almost as good than not speaking to him at all today would be to speak to him on the phone. Last I checked, bed bugs can't teleport through phone lines.",1531169736.0

You have something to look forward to as well, that first morning waking up not in withdrawal will make you feel like you're high, except all natural. Go on a run. And the best part of all, even though you'll be in withdrawal longer than someone who's not quitting, after the withdrawal is over, *you'll never have to experience it ever again*. You'll be free.

Just wanted to let anyone here in WD that it'll be okay, it's all chemically induced. When I was in WD yesterday I wished I could find someone online who could reassure me. Now that I'm feeling better I wanna let know anyone else who's in WD that it'll get better soon too.

That day I got really desperate because of how bad I felt and decided to take 20mg of Hydrocodone syrup (1mg/1ml Hycodan) to help with the withdrawals. That surely helped but I ended up relapsing and before I knew it, I was doing 80-100mg of Oxy a day again. One of the days I had 100mg of Hydrocodone on top of 80mg of Oxy. Now it has been 2 days since I've done any Oxy/Hydrocodone (last dose was 100mg of Hydrocodone). I feel like absolute shit.

This time I'm 100&#37; determined to get through this. Enough is enough. No matter how good it makes me feel, the withdrawals are just not worth it. Not to mention the cost ($60-80 per day). 

Any suggestions on how I can get through this with at least some comfort? Every time I've quit anything, it's always been cold turkey because I end up relapsing when trying to taper. I quit a 2 year 10mg Xanax habit cold turkey (I know, REALLY stupid) and used a shit load of weed and Rick Simpson Oil to get through the 2 weeks of absolute hell. Luckily I didn't get any seizures either.

This time I am somewhat open to tapering because cold turkey hasn't work for me in the case of opioids. However, I'd prefer to get through this cold turkey. I am considering ordering Kratom but it's going to take time to come and I don't want to end up getting addicted to Kratom either lol

Any and all suggestions are greatly appreciated! Mostly, I want the pain in my stomach to go away. The nausea, diarrhia and loss of apetite are my biggest issues. Laying in bed I can at least manage, but going to work in this excrutiating withdrawals is really hard",1531157488.0
8xdyou,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8xdyou/psychosis_on_oxycodone/,26,https://redd.it/8xdyou,mxwkey,Psychosis on Oxycodone,"TL;DR: had a psychotic break on 30mg of oxy, pls give insight

Hey guys, just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or can give me any insight on why this might’ve happened. Will preface with the fact that my drug experience is incredibly limited, though it is recent. I recently took one clonazepam and drank around 75mL of  dihydrocodeine cough syrup. I understand that it’s probably irrelevant to say that but I’m mentioning it just in case someone thinks it could have caused a bad interaction, although I think its been long enough that they wouldn’t be active in my system anymore. 

Sorry if anything I say is stupid I just wanna include everything I can. 

Last night I took around 30mg of oxycodone, it was in the form of snorting from one 40mg pill. I’ll note that the person I was with did around 10mg himself, and was completely fine. 

In the picture I have of the blister it looks like it says 

Oxycodone 

Sandoz 

oxycodone HCl 40mg

modified release

I don’t know how helpful that information is and I don’t really know what it means. I never saw the pill outside the blister before it was crushed and lined up. I didn’t take anything else over the night, I had maybe 3 drinks and took 3 antihistamines (Allersoothe25 I believe)

I have full, clear memories up until a certain point, and then I completely black out. We took the oxy at around 9:30, I think my memory goes around midnight, ambulance was called from my phone at 3:34am, I woke up in hospital at around 10am. When I’m blackout drunk I still remember some things, or have vague memories, so this is a really strange experience. 

From what the hospital and the person I was with has told me, I had a psychotic break. I do not have a history with psychosis.

The beginning of the break is apparently me accidentally elbowing him in the face, and when he pointed it out, I started elbowing and punching him on purpose. I am not normally a violent person and I definitely physically could not have caused him harm (I’m a 5’5 female, he was not threatened at all and said I could barely throw a punch)

He says I was acting strange for around 3 hours before he called the police and the ambulance. He says I was pacing around the room in my underwear (will note here that I do remember taking my shirt off at the start of the high as I was very itchy), talking gibberish, head and eyes rolling. I was apparently knocking things over and screaming in his bathroom. He would try to talk to me and I would respond with just complete nonsense. The example he gave was when we were talking about video games I responded to a question with “I found a two dollar bill on the sidewalk yesterday morning”

So yeah, just wondering if anyone else has experienced psychosis on oxycodone or any similar drugs, looking it up online gives me basically nothing and everything says opioid-induced psychosis is incredibly rare. Otherwise any ideas of what might have gone wrong would be great too. 

Any insight with what a bad high on oxycodone is usually like would be helpful too, just really looking for some clarity on this situation. ",1531157538.0

i have 1 oxy 40mg pill. it came in a blister so im confident it isnt counterfeit, unless counterfeit pills can come in blisters? (obviously it has certain opioid related dangers!)

id love to try it, can you recommend method of administration and dosage please? i insufflate other drugs relatively frequently, and i dont think it makes much sense to IV a pill considering the binder+filler it contains. 

i would ideally like to insufflate, for the 'rush' ive heard about. ( i understand this stuff is on the internet to research, sorry if this gets removed due to this, but id like a personal opinion!)

my real question however: how intense is the feeling? ive used mdma and acid before, at 0.3g and one tab of 200microgram doses respectively. i understand that these things arent directly comparable, however in terms of physics/mental depth of feeling, could someone help me please? 

i understand the addictive and potentially destructive nature of my pretty little ox pill, however i literally have one i was given, and i know of no-one that could supply any opiate, so the addiction isnt a serious threat to me. basically, not to be 'high and mighty' but people telling me not to use it because it has ruined their lives will not  deter me, i simply cannot build a dangerous addiction right now. 

ive asked here because drug websites tend not to explain this well, and erowid seems either doom+gloom or get me more! will it make me sigh in intense happiness like mdma crystal? or is it a more subtle and relaxing high? thanks in advance",1531154121.0

I spent like $200 on pills, and when those ran out I even asked her for a couple of her percocets. I swore I would never be that kid. I only asked once so I wasn't going total junkie (and would never DREAM of stealing from her) but just the fact that I couldn't even enjoy my time there without drugs was a huge wake up call.

8xbthi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8xbthi/was_very_lucky_last_night/,23,https://redd.it/8xbthi,playmaker1209,Was very lucky last night.,"Ok guys so I’ve been lurking on this sub for years, but this is my first post. So I’m on strict probation from an arrest stemming from a possession charge in Jan of 2017. What happened was I fell asleep at the wheel while I was getting gas. A cop knocked on my window and woke me up and got me out of the car and found literally 0.1g in a bag that I had left. The other bags were completely empty. They ended up charging me with possession of 9.4 grand because they weighed the empty bags. Yes, really.... super dumb but it’s still s possession charge and no difference because of weight. 

So for the most part I’ve been doing fairly well lately except I relapse recently. I relapsed a few days ago and used up until last night. (I was beating all my drops just by diluting my urine easily passing each one) so I picked up some dope and this dope would make me literally pass out for long periods of time. I’m not talking about nodding out for like 20 minutes, I’m talking about literally waking up an hour or two after I shot up. (Btw does this just mean the dope was cut with some kind of sedative?) anyway I went to go get gas last night and this happened to be the same gas station where I was arrested last year with a cop knocking on my window. I did one more shot before getting gas and the next thing I know is a cop knocking on my window. I woke up thinking “oh fuck I’m so fuck I’m going to jail and then prison because I can’t be getting in trouble on my probation.” So before I roll down my window (I have 15% tints on the sides and back) I made sure everything was out of sight and it was. I rolled down the window and the cop says “hey you look pretty tired there, is everything ok? In which I told him yes I’ve been working my ass of lately and been lacking sleep and I pulled into the gas station because I didn’t want to drive home so tired. He proceeds to tell me that he totally understands and that I can either call someone to pick me up or he can give me a ride home. So I proceed to park my car in the train station parking lot right next to the gas station and get in the cop car and he drives me home. 

This cop was the only good experience I’ve had with the police. I guess he was from my hometown and the police from last year that arrested me was from the town right next to mine and I was on the border. I mean the cop literally said “we don’t want anyone getting arrested or going to jail tonight, we just want anyone to get home safely.” I mean has anyone met cops that are just straight up genuine people that really care? I know that they’re out there, but never have come across one of them in my experience. ",1531144606.0

I have no issue with people getting clean. Deep down most of us probably would rather be clean, and I’m sure most of us have or will try to get clean eventually. I personally am clean more than I am using for the last 4 years. 

When I’m sober I don’t even come to this sub. I see that as the IRL equivalent of hanging out at the trap house. But it seems that it’s become the IRL equivalent of having an AA meeting in the trap house living room. I noticed this on my last relapse a few years ago, when I got back on this sub, and it seems even ‘worse’ now. I say ‘worse’ because maybe I’m the only one who sees it as an issue. Which I guess must be true, because if it wasn’t I’m sure it would of been posted about before now, and maybe addressed. 

Like I said, I have no problem with recovery; but I wouldn’t show up to a meeting pushing drugs on people, and telling them how great it is to get high. It seems like here on a sub that I thought was supposed to be about sharing an active enjoyment of opiates, there is a lot of people showing up and pushing recovery, despite the fact there is a sub just for that topic. 

I also get the whole harm reduction thing, and making resources available, but we could easily just pin a link to r/recovery, and maybe list of other useful sites. Instead of turning this sub into a confused place. 

I’m sure there will be tons of hate on this, which is whatever, but I’m just giving an opinion. I’ve been coming to this sub on and off for a loooooooong time, and it’s changed a lot. This whole 2, or 3 out of 5 posts being posts that should be in r/recovery is the worse change yet though. If you ask me.

Me and my boy Mikie are getting ready To close up the kitchen it’s about 1am at the time, Texting my girlfriend and asking Mikey if he wants to get a double shot at the bar before my girl Gets here. He declines and we go out for a smoke, we’re standing out front smoking our cigs and she text me she’s around back. Tell her pull around front and we were off on our way back to Kansas LOL. We are in the nicest neighborhood ever but we were on the highway Obeying all laws not doing anything wrong and the lights flash. Boom. Police. Fuck. I’m holdin, Mikies holdin, my girls probably got her weed in her bra, they’re both walking up they tell my girl to roll her window down , The second one tells me and mikie to roll our windows down also,  We do, they tell us they’re the state police and The reason for pulling us over was our tail light was out. And I am in my head fucking bugging. I’m holding a felony in my pocket mikies got a felony in his bag and I’m already a double felon.. But on my face, I’m as cool as a fucking cucumber. My girl tells me to go in the glove box for her registration and proof of insurance to give the cop. I hand her then and the second officer asked Mikie and I for our names and IDs, which was ridiculous on its own, We tell him that we left them at home because we were at work And didn’t think we’d need them. So yes for all of our information vocally, goes to the police car, comes back and asks for our Social Security numbers. WTF, we Musta ran into fucking super cop or something, what are we on the set of super troopers, At this time I know I’m going to jail, but How am I going to go for just the warrant though with this on me. I know that I have some time before they run everything so I go to grab my phone and on the way my pointer finger slips what I have on me into the pile of trash in the little compartment on the side of the door, And they come right to my window and tell me to step out and immediately put my hands on my head, and before I could even get out of the vehicle I was being forced and moved into position to be searched. I got this. is what’s going through my head. But dude I don’t feel good having another man literally grab and squeeze on your d*ck and n*ts at the same time. Fucking Dehumanizing, They take me to the back of their police car and asked me what is all in the car and what we are all really doing after we already Told them in detail what we were doing, twice. I guess they just weren’t buying the truth, idiots. I told them they can search everything they can search me my girlfriend in the car but they’re just going to waste their time, they ask what’s on Mikie, I tell them he’s Straight forward with his life he doesn’t mess with anything really and if you had anything going on I’d be in his book bag but he just got robbed yesterday on his way to work so he left at home today so he literally has nothing on him, As I’m telling these assholes everything I am tweaking out of my mind high as fuck Ctfu, They ask if I’m off any substances or alcohol I tell them no I’m just getting off work knowing damn well I was just in the smoke area snorting a little mountain off of my hand. Like I said, I got this. They put me in the back of the cop car, handcuffs extra tight, Because I was moving around when they cuffed me up. They read me my Miranda rights and tell me I have two warrants both for $2500, And that I’d probably be spending the night in jail, They both then get out, walk to my girlfriends car, and I see Mikey get into the front seat so I know we are golden on the search, . The only time ever, in the backseat of a police car, I felt relieved to see my friends pull away without me, FML.

You see, in the summer the vegetation along the side opposing the road obstructs the six to twelve inches into the bile path. This being on my right in this case, I tend to hug the right to give room for pedestrians. Most people who know a bike is zipping along don't purposely stand in front of one, but I'm not worried about normal people, as opposed to bionic people on bikes.



My biggest fear is children who appear to be standing still who decide to randomly jump in front of my bike. Then their parents would be mad pissed no matter what caused the collision, not to mention I'd feel really bad if a kid was injured even if it was their stupid idea. Beyond that you never know if the 1/100 crazier amongst normies blends in and does something crazy. Namely, jumping in front of my bike. You'd think this never happens but it is actually a thing. I kid you not, it's happened to me twice in the past two or three years and I've dodged the individual(s) each time.

Oh yeah, so anyway.. about that flower. Yeah it was a nice thick green stem with a bulbous green bud up top. It looked like hair, with spikes comprising the most obvious hairs. Obvious when that shit smacks into your right hand, luckily the spikes are soft enough to prick the surface, still letting blood but measured in nano-liters.


P.S- I forgot to mention that the flower reminded me of an opium poppy that was nearly ripe for harvesting but with spiky hairs on it.",1531118496.0

(sub and heroin same time),"Hello all! I tried to get clean with Suboxone this week but I ended up getting precipitated with drawls and it was a total fucking fail lmao 

Anyway I talk to my sister, who has been an opiate user for the past 10 years and she told me an interesting method of getting clean.

so the first day you take 1/8 of a Suboxone and take a little bit less of your normal dope, then the next day you do the same thing if you don’t feel great or you up it to 1/4 a strip. But while you’re increasing the Suboxone you are lowering the amount of dope you are shooting. 
 
So you basically increase sub and
decrease dope until you’re fully on subs. 

I have never heard of this method, of taking Suboxone and heroin at the same time, and I’m a bit wary because precipated withdrawls are absolute hell. 

Has anyone heard of this, or have any additional tips on this method of tapering?

Currently on a 40 day or so binge on BTH (smoked) about half gram per day. Been messing around with H for the last couple years but haven't gone more then 3-4 days in a row followed by a month off.  Needless to say I never went through much of any withdrawals doing it that way. 

After this binge I know for a fact I'm going to withdrawl tough. I've been smart enough to look through this place to find tips of things to do and use to make withdrawls much more bearable.  I have a job that requires me to be upbeat and always on my feet so I'm trying to find the best options to help me through this without missing any work. 

This is what I've been able to get so far:

-  1 kilo of Kratom (red,white,green,ect..)
- 1 OZ of 20X kratom extract (from Gaia)
- 13   5mg hydrocodone pills
- 1 pressed xanax bar(prob closer to 3mg)
- 40 2mg Lope pills
- 2-3 grams BHO/Live Resin
- 1 15mg IR adderall 
- cough pills with DXM 
- small amount of DMT and a few Shroom caps 

Let me know what you guys think I should do and or when I should take each of these things.  This will be the first time going through this shit...Any suggestions are much appreciated:-)

She found me hiding out under a bus stop.  I was waiting out the prior afternoon’s freezing downpour and keeping the bearings on my skateboard dry.  When she asked me if I wanted to come home with her and that she’d pay for the bus ride, I obliged.  On her bed’s dingy sheets and in the dark of her apartment, she whispered words made of warm lung and toothpaste into my mouth.  I bit her lip.  The thin, plastic bag skin of her legs and stomach stuck to mine in the sticky heat under the covers.  We smoked in bed when we were through.  



In the morning I rifled through the cabinet behind her mirror and took a bottle of Xanax while she slept.  I took one and did a shot of heroin before walking down the hill towards Safeway, where I saw the soot streaked piece of Kleenex whose corner had been sopped in grease.  It tumbled in the wind across the asphalt.  I reached for it to throw it away, but compassion came over me.  I hesitated.  Was picking up this piece of what society called garbage, taking it against its will and tossing it into a steel can to waste the rest of its life, the right thing to do?  Society called me garbage.  There were special armed organizations who existed to take my freedom from me.  There was a metal can they wanted to throw me into, too, and keep me there to waste away.  



I let the tissue go.  It was the right thing to do, the only thing to do.  The Kleenex fluttered between my fingers before it broke free, doing cartwheels down the pavement as I pulled away from it.  My heart leapt. The movie of its entire life played out in my mind, a heartbreaking and inspiring cinematic achievement.  There were hard times, floating in the wind down desert roads and dirty streets.  There were seedy characters, and there was sadness in Las Vegas.  Love made an appearance in its life, just to disappear and leave the tissue all alone again.  Tastes of fame and success came at a price no one wants to pay.  Alcoholism and cocaine wrought havoc in the its life.  Finally, the Kleenex found a wife and settled down somewhere outside of Kansas City to start a family of little baby tissues, who all grew up to become incredible Kleenex of their own making every bit of suffering in their father’s life worth it. 

Before the credits would have rolled, tears fell from my eyes.  I lifted my cap and hand, cheering on the tissue, celebrating the beauty of its life and all its potential as it tumbled further down the pavement.  Towards the end of the parking lot, a well to do citizen of the city picked it up.  The stranger threw that piece of Kleenex into a garbage can.  




I ran.  I tried to rescue it.  It was too late.  The trash was soaked and when I grabbed the tissue, it dissolved in my hand, all that promise turned into pitiful pieces of nothing, and no one even cared.

I have yet to find a dealer that sticks so every time I want to do it ( it's usually a month or so in between uses) I have to go through a middle and hope I don't get majorly fucked (because there is no way i'm not going to get a little fucked over with a middle). 

Anyways, I just moved and wanted to christen the new place the best way I know how so I hit up a few people I know and got absolutely nothing. My friend a few hours away says she can get it for me and I can go up there whenever to get it, I just have to send her the cash. So of course I am down and ask her how much for two grams. She tells me she'll have to ask (she doesn't mess with this stuff) but that last she heard it was around 80 a g. I am ecstatic about that price because I've been getting dicked around by middle's the last few times so it's always been around $110 a g plus I have to break them off some (after they have shorted me on it too!).

So I tell her I'll send her $200 and just to get me two grams and she can have whatever's leftover. She tells me to wait so she can confirm the price. Well, it turns out that she doesn't know the dealer but was going through her friend who is a 'major addict' and when she asked him the price of two grams he freaked out on her and said that it would be way too risky to drive with that much so he won't do it.

Do I just want it to chill in my nasal canal or cavity? I've heard that you don't want to have a drip because that's wasting it and going into your stomach.

Edit and it's fucking long but I think it's a great read. That's my fucking opinion lol. 

I ended up finding an old bag of long points. Drank 3 bottles of water. Lifted some weights, tied off above my left elbow and hit on the right side somewhere and thank God because my veins are fucked. When I go to the hospital it takes them 2 hours to place an IV with 2 people trying at the same time and the whole time I'm telling them that they have to get the portable ultrasound aka doppler and bam first try. They tell me everytime that I may think I have bad veins but I don't they're just SUPER DEEP. I've been told that by multiple people. I didn't believe it the first time but after hearing it more and more I started to believe it. 

Anyways I shot 23 cents of black and I'm also on Methadone lol so that kinda blocks it lol but I started to get the histamine burning itching on my head and now I feel good. 

I'm at 80mg of methadone daily and it doesn't hold me so lately I've been using. They won't let me go any higher because I'm prescribed clonazepam @nd soon to be 1mg alprazolam, 4 times a day. So 120 1 mg pills. I'm going to see if he'll give me 60 bars but I doubt it because he's weird like that. I'm currently prescribed 1mg K-Pin 4 times a day.  Those are usually give in less than a week. Crazy but true. I'm not ok them right now because I already ate all 120 I got on the 28th. 
As you can tell I'm high cuz I'm telling you everything and anything.

I had one post drafted that was reasonably short but then I went to add a ""little detail"" and it just multiplied in size. Thus at risk of presenting something less cohesive and coherent I'm going to make this super concise.


Where to begin?

**This is not a Cliffpost.** There maybe brief mentions or references to Cliff and past posts related to interactions with him but that is not the focus of this post.

&nbsp;

A couple of weeks ago I bought some heroin from Derrick, then some from Tim and then a little more from Derrick. Tim is my old homey, and although I have to bike three to five extra miles after I meet him and although he can only help middle after 9pm on a work night - he has proven to be way more trustworthy. In contrast, I heard stories of Derrick's antics before I even became an addict. He was known for taking dope out of individual bags and then taping them shut to give the illusion that it was un-touched.

&nbsp;

Cliff would always indicate that he can get Derrick to middle because ""he's desperate and he'll be happy to take one to two free bags"". Sometimes Derrick would take an extra bag - perhaps this was on those occasions when he didn't have time to go home first to skim key hits. If one bag was normal and another half sized he'd say ""my plug ran out of bags, this one is a double and this [tiny ass bag] is a normal sized one."" Realisitcally, why would and why should Derrick walk a mile to get Cliff his dope in exchange for two or three bags. We all know about tolerance, there's no way that would be tolerable for him unloess he was skimming more. 

He is not an IV user, not sure if that would incraese or reduce his needs but I think many would agree it is a line that once crossed, it often accelerates the spiraling down.

&nbsp;

My point in mentinoning all this is that my most accessible middle has history of scheming to get more dope than initially agreed upon. He sold me spice or some other kind of seasoning that *is not* exclusively Jewish in origin. It was a fat half single bag for half a bundle and when I called to complain he said ""three other people said the same thing"" even though I knew he was only picking up dope for me during that order and totally bullshitting me. I rolled with it just in hope he'd pay me back, and two night later he gave me 4/5 bags saying he'll have the other later. 

It was sufficient but even these bags were mostly skimpy as fuck. I didn't expect the fifth bag ever to be given to me and didn't bother asking about it.

&nbsp;

Late last week, Friday was the last day I consumed dope. That saturday I had no more than 2-3 days worth of Suboxone (with 1-2mg dosages) and took 1mg to until I got more. Fortunately, Suboxone connect was available and happy to see me that afternoon.


The first couple of days after a dope binge I'm able to stay well with the subs and can also get natural endophines from riding my bike. Maybe it's because I sleep with a lot of blankets but I often tend to sweat more during the first night or two - almost like when in withdrawal. I wake up sometimes feeling a little panicked before taking my dose.

&nbsp;


**Latst week's Suboxone consumption log:**

Started on June 30th
Saturday: Less than 4mg and more than 3mg.

Sunday: Not more than 3mg, maybe a little less.

Monday: More than 2mg and definitely less than 3mg.

Tuesday: Not much more than 2mg.

Wednesday: 2mg, maybe 2.25mg?

Thursday: 2mg

Friday: 2mg

Saturday: 2mg

Sunday: 2mg   -- Today.


&nbsp;

It is noteworthy to point out that when I say 2mg, I'm not really sure if it's 2mg. I've always worked under the assumption that the medication is distributed evenly in a pill or strip. This is my first time using the ""stop sign"" pills and the straight edge can make estimation of size a bit confusing when compared with circula pills. I use a pill cutter so that at least helps me get clean cuts. I've cut a couple of them down to roughly 1mg. I didn't do it to more yet because only had half a pill left after sticking everything else into a pill case. Luckily I picked up two more pills last night so later on after I get home tonight I'll try cutting one of the pills into 8ths - the result hopefully being that I have eight individual 1mg pieces of a pill.


&npsp;

Unfortunately I left out all of the entertaining content, shit like ""Cliff did that and does this"" and ""Derrick is a shady middle because his bags are skimpy and I've hard stories of his antics before I became an addict.""


All that I will say here about Cliff and Derrick is that Derrick owed Cliff a couple of bags a week and a half ago and told Cliff he'd definitely pay him back because ""sloan is making a big order on pay day"", thereby meaning he was going to skim from my oroder to pay Cliff back. Cliff said that if Derrick didn't pay him back, asked if I could give him a couple of bags to ""try as a sample."" Also said that he didn't need it because he still had pills left from his script.

&nbsp;

There's so much more detail but in short it's this simple. I can't trust Derrick to keep my business with him bewteen him and I, and Cliff has no right to be injected into the middle of my business dealings. Furthermore, I will continue to maintain a zero tolerance policy with regard to doing business with Cliff. Let's say he owed me soemthing, got his script and came to my front door, I'd have to let him in. If he doesn't owe and I don't owe him anything, then even if he shows up at my door I can prevent his entry.


This is critical to me because he is a walking Bed Bug infestation.

&nbsp;

Lastly, I've heard stories of Derrick's antics before I became an addict. The rumors are confirmed, he does many shady things. He sold 


&nbsp;

P.S.-

My heart just sunk a little bit. I prefer avoiding confrontation but I think I'm gonna have to level with Cliff. I'm really commited to taking care of myself and my interest this time. I'm so commited that I don't want to risk putting myself in the line of tempation by being offered a line, which would inevitably happen if ""clean and commited Sloan"" went to hang out with Cliff to do something normal and mundane like watching a movie or a new episode of SVU.

I don't want to deny a human friend of friendship and quality time, but the risks to my interests are too high.


Why this heavy postscript? Past few days he'd text me ""whats up"" and I would sometimes answer and other times not. A couple of times I was at work and said so, and he'd ask ""waht you doin after?"" Those last two times I didn't say. In the past I might honestly or dishonestly say I was hanging out somewhere else. If I was biking 20 minles I would honestly say so.""

Tonight I am hanging out with another friend, but if I wasn't.. I wouldn't say I would be home with nothing to do. 


So after I just texted back saying I was at work he asked today and said, ""what u doin after work? **we never hang out anymore dude**""

I just don't know what to say to that. I feel like no matter what I'll either offend him, hurt his feelings or recieve a countering response. Even if he reassured me of all my concerns, I'd still be worried about the Bed Bugs and I'm not comfortable sayings ""I can't go into your house anymore because I don't want to to start a new Bed Bug infestation at home.""

&nbsp;

Also, I've been sitting on more than enough money to buy a bundle and a half of dope for the past week and have not. I only bought two more subs yesterday which extends my total supply to be good for 14 days at 2mg.

That is all.",1531077130.0

45 minutes before You takes his opiate dose, You should consume 600mg of Tagamet HB (Cimetidine), A large glass of White Grapefruit Juice (100% Juice, From concentrate is preferable), and A large glass of Tonic Water. This ties up the enzymes in you's body that metabolizes (read: Destroys and renders inactive) his oxycontin. This allows the oxycontin to be in your blood-stream longer and in a higher concentration (read: The oxycontin now lasts longer and has the effects of taking a larger amount of oxycontin without potentiation)

35 minutes before You takes his opiate dose, You should take 30mg of DMX (Robotussin). This is said to help prevent tolerance from building up against opiates.

20 minutes before You takes his opiate dose, You should take 2 Tums (or 1.5Tbsp of Baking soda) to raise the PH of you's stomach. This allows the stomach to absorb the oxycontin more effectively, and thus bring on the effects of oxycontin quicker and more powerfully.

0 Minutes before You takes his opiate dose, You should either chew up his pill and swallow it, or ground it up and parachute it.

This formula should give the best high and longest duration for you's oxycontin. ",1531073911.0

So by the time I go back to work this week I will be almost exactly 48 hours clean. Chances are I won't be tested that day but I'm making this post just in case I am and for future reference. Do any of you have experiences being tested 48 hours after the last time You used? Id be interested in hearing the fastest you ever passed and maybe even horror stories of the longest you ever failed. And my final question is just how much does drinking a ton of water and sweating help? I plan on being safe today and just drowning myself in water and also hitting the park and playing basketball for a few hours and sweating out like 5 pounds. I've definitely heard that this helps, and it definitely makes sense in my simple brain, but if anyone has any real insight it would be appreciated",1531059163.0

Ok so the last post I made was about the closest person in the world to me dying. And me and my other best friend are prettyyyyy sure for alot of reasons that he didn't accidently overdose, he did it on purpose and it was spelled out for all of us we were all just I guess too busy with our own shit to notice until it was too late. So yeah, I've been having a pretty difficult time with the grieving process you could say. When he died, I had already been using again really heavily for about 5 months and it was bad, like really bad, but it got so much worse after he died. At least a dozen fent pressed roxis a day, which is a shit load of fent where I'm from. I got arrested for the first time and all my family and friends wouldn't get me out because they were scared I was gonna die. Fast forward a month of being in jail where it was easier to get high than on the streets, and I get bonded out out of nowhere by a person the bondslady said wishes to be anonymous. Ok cool. I thought things MIGHT get better bc jail really sucked and I never want to go back buuuttt that was kinda a pipe dream. 

I get real fucked up for a day, buy a shit load of pills, and go back to rehab the day after I got out of jail and brought enough pills to ""taper off"" and clearly that didn't work. I leave after a month bc I was still getting high everyday anyways and move in with this girl I'm friends with, whose also in love with me, who also does pills. I get super fucking bad off again and really strung out with these awful looking track marks, I'm still not even properly greiving, I hardly ever even know which way is up I'm so high all the time, and i decide I need to make a change because I was going to end up dying. Really. So I make arrangements to move back to my home town an hour away i haven't lived in in 3 years with a friend I've had for over a decade. I basically cold turkeyd off pills and I've been off them for a few weeks now. I don't even have anything to say about detoxing anymore really. It's the same everytime and it sucks but it passes. 

Now here come the real reasons why I'm so bitter now and I'm really gonna bitch.

A My family and I are on extremely rocky terms at least, well everyone except me and my mom. She's great and I love her so much but she really has no clue the shit show that my life has really become. Granted, she hasn't seen me except for a couple times this entire year so that helps. My family still lives here so it's complicated for me to move back here. My dad is basically the biggest asshole you could ever imagine, and I haven't spoken to him since shortly after Nick died and my father said that he got what he deserved, and I'd be the next. Thanks, dad. I hate to admit it but i'm a very very emotional and needy person so being at odds with my family has always really fucked with me. 

My friend that i moved in with has always been one of the chillest and most understanding people I've ever met, even though he's not an addict. The mother of his 2 year old son overdosed and died at the beginning of the year on heroin 3 days after she got out of rehab...so he knows grief too. Well he has decided he is in love with me after we legitimately had a big conversation about that never becoming a problem if i moved in with him before I came. I'd pay rent and be an awesome roommate and we'd continue being friends like we always have been. He was ALL FOR IT. Now he's gone and made shit all awkward for me as I have to continuously make it clear that while I appreciate his help and friendship more than I could ever say, I'm not trying to be anything more than friends with anyone anytime soon. I just can't right now y'all like I'm hanging on by a thread here as is, I haven't been clean that long, and I'm half crazy still from all the shit I've been through. Honestly tho how fucked up in the head is he to want to be with someone whose obviously not current dating material like me? It's just so frustrating. 

So me and my best friend of well over a decade, J, who was also Nick's best friend start hanging out regularly again since I've moved back. He's not an addict but he's still handing Nick's death as badly as me and I truly believe that there is no one that this is harder for than me except for maybe him. We were Nick's real family. We were each other's family. The three of us have been through more together the last 12 years than anyone could ever imagine. J is the only person in my life and in Nick's life who can say they stuck around from the very beginning of our addictions, until the very end in Nick's case. He witnessed the chaos that was our relationship when in active addiction and listened to all the bullshit every single time either of us ever called him. During the periods that Nick and I would break up and not see each other for awhile, J never once took sides and always loved us both equally. We both have lived with him at some point, both together and individually. He bailed Nick out of jail both times he was arrested for drugs and let him move in with him for as long as he wanted. J has fought fiercely for his friendship with us for as long as we've known him just as we have for him. Nick's mother, who is literally the most horrible woman I've ever known, made it very clear that she never wanted him and sent him to live with his grandmother at a young age and his millionaire dad left while his mother was still pregnant and was never in the picture until much later. I've been at odds with at least my father for the better part of my adult life, sometimes my mom too, and have never felt like a part of my family. So ultimately I think me and Nick always looked to J for guidance because we didn't really have anyone else. But since Nick died, it's all J can do to fend for himself and I get it because I feel the same way. It is so hard though to see him like this though and not being able rely on him for a solution on how to just feel better. Or even just feel okay, I'd even be thrilled with that. He's always been able to help me fix things but he can't fix this. We're basically just clinging to each other for whatever small amount of comfort or support we can get and basically holding on for dear life. It's just like why can't I just stop thinking about how sad I am or what I could have done differently or what Nick's voice sounds like or about that one time we got lost and stuck in the mountains for 6 hours because we were drifting like dumbasses or about how his little brother is doing? Like seriously people die all the time and I don't really see other people greiving at the level that I still am 3 months after their loved one dies. I mean really, i haven't really ever seen anyone ever openly struggle with a death as badly as I have so that means one of two things. Either they're just really good at hiding it and I'm not or (and I think this is the more likely of the choices) I've finally hit my breaking point and I've just lost all ability to properly deal with anything and everything life throws at me, dooming me to this severe depression and anxiety for the rest of my life. Probably mostly due to severe drug addiction and trauma lol. 

Guys I just feel like I'm never gonna be ok. These are just the major things driving me crazy right this second, but there's so much more little shit going on too and I just can't handle all this bullshit at once. No one that I talk to or try to talk to really get it's except J, and i can't burden him with my shit too. So, I usually hold everything in for as long as possible and frequently have a range of minor to major meltdowns because of it. Not even trying to be funny, but I've seriously questioned my sanity more in the last two weeks alone than I have the rest of my life put together. Maybe I've finally cracked man, idk. Fear is a constant companion of mine now... I'm scared the majority of my time now. Of everything. 

If you've made it this far congratulations, you're almost done lol. This is the last bit of my rant is the real root of how godawful I'm feeling these last couple of days and it's just because I royally fucked up like i always do and why I'm really so mad and sad and broken and betrayed feeling nonstop these last few days. 

J and I ran into Nick's grandmother, the one that raised him I guess 3 days ago now. She'd done so much for all 3 of us over the years that J and I decide to buy her a few bottles of nice wine to drink with us (she drinks a bottle a night at least and has for as long as I remember) and go check on her. WORST idea we have ever had to date i think. It was probably necessary for us to finally get all this pain out in the open like we did but we should not have done it there. We tortured ourselves, going to where Nick lived for years growing up and even randomly throughout adulthood and where we had so many memories with him everywhere we looked. But we felt obligated to Nick to check on his oma because she had to be hurting too. We ended up drinking 4 bottles of wine together and talked about Nick for the better part of 5 hours. Alot came out that Nick had lied about and some of it really broke my heart even more knowing he lied to even me. We also pretty much verified that yes she also knew Nick had done this on purpose. 

So we leave and I'm drunk as shit and all fucked up in the head and I'm going to hang out with an old hookup buddy I used to have that I used to get high with because I'm not going home to deal with the bitch ass there. We go get some dope, I do 3 key bumps of it to try it and that's the last thing I remember (around 10pm) until I guess you can say i finally came to at 530am. I od'd so bad that my dude I was with that I mentioned, who I've always stayed super tight with, said he looked over at me in the passenger seat of his truck after I'd been out there waiting for him to come back out so we could go home and do more dope for about 10 minutes and I was dead. He narcan me 3 times and does CPR and brings me back. He doesn't wanna bring me back to his place super fucked up and anyone see me and start some shit so he just drives around with me I guess sleeping in his passenger seat if that's what you call it?? I don't fucking know. But he said he had to make sure I kept breathing because he had to stop 7 or 8 more times to do cpr again. Coming to was the most bizzare experiences of my life. I've never been so close to death and while nothing has actually changed everything felt different. That fear I've always carried with me multipled.

As if that of isn't bad enough in itself, i somehow threw my back out. I'm 26 years old and I literally can't even walk hardly because I actually threw my back out. It seems as though everything bad happens to me. On top of the constant debilitating pain that's the worst I've ever experienced everytime I move, I have been unable to sleep a wink since the od, 72 hours ago. I've dozed off a couple times for probably 2 of those hours max. I am so fucking uncomfortable I want to scream and I officially have developed the worst attitude I've ever had just because I'm now not only am I emotionally destroyed but I'm in the worst physical pain I've ever been in too and can't even manage to sleep through it. I literally don't want anyone even coming anywhere near me, touch me, or even really talk to me except for a select few people. I'm being such a bitch to everyone because the pot is finally boiling over--I'm so fucking mad at everyone for every stupid reason you could possibly imagine; my family for not being there for me, Nick for leaving me, my roommate for falling for me, J for not fixing the way I'm feeling, and as if that's not enough, that I threw my fucking back out!! I'm so fucking sad too though; that I lost Nick, that J is hurting, that i feel do doomed, that everything in my life has changed so much. Life just sucks so bad right now and I can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel... I didn't quit drugs to be miserable still and have my life be even more chaotic than before. 


Ok I'm finally done I got it all out....I think. I'm cringing at how long it is lol but I had to get it out or spontaneously combust. I'm gonna smoke another blunt and try to fall asleep again since I can't move from my bed anyways. Fml. If literally even one person read it all the way through, thank you so much for giving a shit enough to care for a couple minutes while reading what I had to get out. if not, at least I got it all off my chest for my own wellbeing. Love each and every single one of y'all and you're all good people no matter what you're going through.

So, apparently it's a documented fact that people can overdose from their usual amount by being in places that are unfamiliar to them . As if the brain prepares the user with some tolerance as it knows what is coming in familiar scenarios. 

&nbsp;
To me, this sounds absurd. The only mechanism behind the pgenomenon I can think of is adrenaline.

I am British and I smoked some weed once in America when I was 16 when I met this girl on vacation and I was TRASHED. Way beyond anything I have ever experienced. I was a heavy smoker with some tolerance under my belt before I went. This was like going back to the first time. I had munchies so badly I was getting potatoes out the trash and eating them in front of her mother who was trying to ask me what England was like and I COULD barely strong a sentence together 

It could have just been very love t weed, but I've still never experienced anything like that and I came across some very strong bud in the years following that encounter.

So, it could be true. I've never experienced it since and I don't know whether that counts. But I felt completely lost while I was there. I ditched my family to hang out with a girl and got to see the every day non tourist side of Arizona.

Personally, I don't see how this could happen to me with heroin as I'm almost always outside, in weird places, scoring down unfamiliar roads, using odd public toilets, meeting strange people. The whole thing is unique despite being in Groundhog day, getting up and trying to stay well. But, being abroad is about as unfamiliar as you can get. I had a friend come stay with me from Florida a couple years back and we both shot the same amount of the same batch. It didn't affect me at all, I thought it was garbage, no rush, no euphoria, barely got me well. But it knocked him unconscious for 45 minutes. I thought he had died when he fell off my bed sitting up with it still in his arm so, maybe it happened to him.

Anyway, I just wondered if anyone else has experienced this phenomenon or has any ideas about it. ",1531045359.0

Three. It may not be long for some, but to me, I’ve just had this epiphany tonight at 1AM, in the midst of WDing, that I’m not letting this ‘disease’ or whatever the fuck others may call it fuck with me; I consider it a bad choice I made at the time, but I’m done with all the bullshit.


I’ve slowly built back the trust with my mom who I’ve always had a shitty relationship with before even all the drugs came into the picture. I’m finally reconnecting with her and the rest of my family. The other day as I came home after copping a couple bars to stave off withdrawals, she came home soon after and told me how I’ve been such a good daughter to her (not knowing that I’ve relapsed on heroin months prior). This made me think about it constantly of all the shit I’ve done and said to her and everyone dear to me. So now, I’ve decided this will be it. 

Journey’s gonna be rough, but at least I’m not alone anymore. I also have a boyfriend who’s been very understanding of my situation (we’ve been on and off for almost 6 years now) who doesn’t fuck with that shit, and I won’t drag the people I care about or anyone else down with me any longer. That is all.


I wish you motherfuckers all the best, and it’s been a long and bumpy ride for me. I’m sure I’ll have lapses in judgment in sobriety here and there since I ain’t perfect, but I really hope to Satan that if I ever go to hell, he’ll at least give me props for not causing anymore grief to the fam and my loved ones. Cheers.


PS Any recommendations to stave of the mental cravings will be a huge help for me. I’m a huge anime/JRPG junkie so yeah lol. Or maybe something a bit more productive and outside my ‘comfort’ zone (mostly sedentary lifestyle) is appreciated as well...or idk go out for a change and do something

Well the smoking inside created a problem so I came up with the idea, I think it’s genius, LOL but it works like a champ. I take a empty paper towel roll stuff it with dryer sheets that smell delicious and then take a black trash bag and wrap the paper towel roll in it with  a little sticking out.

switched from pills to dope a few years back and split 1 - 2 grams of powder per day with my girl, who smokes it. about a year and a half ago I developed a nasty nasal infection and it's just gotten worse. sometimes the mucus that comes up is like rubber or even as thick as cheap plastic sometimes. almost clogged up 24/7, often takes 20 minutes just to get a nostril open enough to get a decent sized bump up. most of the time I just snort my bump up into a bunch of fucking snot. seems like fent-heavy dope doesn't clog me as bad but that could just be coincidences. some weeks are better than others and some kinds of dope make it a little easier but it's pretty much a daily battle. sometimes I'll get a wide open nostril and get a bump up, which gets me way higher than when clogged obviously. it sucks because I'm basically wasting dope and nothing is worse than losing dope when you're already a struggling junkie. 

I've tried everything - drips, sprays, inhalers, netti pot, spicy shit, hot shower, snorting, blowing, massaging, you name it. shit sucks. my breathing got so bad one time we went to urgent care and got some antibiotics, a 5 day supply. those gave me huge relief but 2 days after they ran out I was back to dying. recently got other antibiotics from a family member but they're not strong enough. made 2 other unsuccessful returns to urgent care (nodding too much had to leave one time, no real relief other time) but hopefully I'll get time to go back again soon to get the original antibiotics that worked. 

so I'm hoping one of you guys here on Reddit has some kind of magical fix for junkie nose. anyone dealing with something similar?

I know this question might be better suited to /r/methadone but I don’t really know anyone over there. And I trust everyone here to keep things real.

Mostly I just lurk here these days, I’ve got 19 months clean now. I’m asking for my exgf. She’s an addict but also has Stage 4 ovarian cancer.

Anyway, being an addict, she left some methadone with a friend to hold before her UA at a new palliative care doc. You know how it is, you’re afraid you’ll take everything you have and then be screwed for the UA.

As expected, shit got fucked up. Friend’s husband found the methadone and took it. Now exgf is facing a UA at a brand new doc with no methadone in her system. She’s moved to a different state, has no connections, etc.

And she’s terrified that she’ll be cut off from pain meds and have to die of cancer without anything to ease her way.

I know everyone always asks “how can I pass a drug test when I’ve got shit in my system?” but I’m asking the opposite.

Does anyone know how to make a UA read pos for methadone when there’s none in her system? I know that’s a crazy question, I swear. 

The alternative is for her to cold cop and I just can’t tell her to take that risk. Tbh my brain is sorta frozen here, it’s such a messed up situation. Before she got sick she had three years clean, so she’s way past knowing anyone who could help out.

This time, I decided to treat myself. I bought 1g. (Done it before a few times, this isn't a first.) For the last two days I've been snorting as usual, but half an hour ago I fucked up, and IMO put a bit too much in the line.

After 5 minutes, I start to 'come down' as I like to call it. All is good. However, things soon start getting more intense. It feels like I have to force myself to breathe, which I've had to do before, but this time, properly force myself. Deep breaths. My heart actually went /faster./ I started getting light headed and dizzy. I start getting pins and needles around my mouth and my right arm. 

I stand up, walk around, do some push ups to focus on something else - but these symptoms get more and more intense by the minute. But then, at the 30 minute mark, they all fade in about a minute. Now I don't even feel that high, and I'm certainly not nodding like I usually do when high.

Well, in 2014 something very unusual to say the least happened in my country. 24,4 kilograms of oxycodone (along with 780 grams of marijuana and 50 ampules of some non especified barbiturate) was hidden in a false bottom under the car seat of a 38 years old man and it was seized by police. At first, the white powder was suspected to be coke, but the test was negative for cocaine. Eventually, it tested positive for oxy.

This is fucking strange not only because the guy had kilos and kilos of powdery oxycodone, but because of the country in which the
drug was found too. There is no opioid culture in Brazil. It's almost impossible to find dealers selling street heroin here, and if you want to do H in this country, the way is buying on the darknet. Very very few drug users know what oxycodone even is. Yet, there is this dude with 24 kilograms of powdery oxy under his car seat. What the fuck.

I.e. is it a good therapy drug for opiate cessation?,"Hey! Hoping someone sophisticated enough to read chemistry search results can confirm or deny this for me. I tried to google it. 

I ceased use a couple days ago -- still on the far side of acute withdrawal but feeling great! Often I'll take kratom for a week or so to help with Restless Leg S / sleeping, as well as General achiness and pain. From what I understand this is necessary because my Mu and Delta opioid receptors are screaming out for something to latch onto, since my endogenous production all but shut down while I was addicted to opiates. I believe Kratom agonizes solely Delta receptors -- hence why it provides comfort without euphoria and has a lower abuse potential. 

Here's the thing -- a friend with epilepsy from whom I was begging comfort meds (sorry Lilo!) offered me some of her Gabapentin/trade name Neurontin. Said it would help me sleep. She said it's off-brand use is for neuropathic pain and treatment of RLS. 

Now I was reluctant to take anything I don't really understand its mechanism of action -- especially some seizure med. But not that reluctant lol! So down the hatch it went. 

45 minutes later I get serious tingles all over and some relief from that tension in my calf muscles (which is maybe the most painful and annoying part of recovery). I know this feeling, I think! That feels like Delta activation! And since I hadn't slept in days I went out like a light. 

So... It seems possible that Gabapentin agonized at least some opioid receptors in my brain, but I'm basing that purely off my subjective experience of it. And I was surprised since it's not an opiate. 

I'm too dumb to figure out whether that's true or not factually. Can someone confirm or deny based on the actual chemistry / mechanism of action?

In any case I found Gabapentin to be comforting while in late acute withdrawal, it helped me finally finally sleep.  So add that to the list I guess. 

And if someone can confirm the MoA maybe it's something people who are hooked up with a GP can request.

A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.

“Can you get anything?”

“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”

“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s next door in my room.”

In 10 minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook-up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.

I had not shot up heroin since I left San Francisco, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs made it feel like an elephant was stepping on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in Tracy’s garbage can.

Some questions I have:

Long term (two years of being clean or so), what are some habits and thought patterns that develop over time to cope?

How did your personal philosophy change pre- and post-using?

How do you deal with boredom and waiting now? Did always waiting on a dealer make you more patient?

If someone tagged a former user with tranquilizers as a means of subdual, what sort of shitstorm do you think would erupt from that? New cravings? Reduced efficacy? 

What are some things only former users can really get? (Like the whole uncontrollable jizzing from hypersensitivity when coming down, the constant fear of dope sickness, etc.)

What is wilderness therapy really like? Did it help? Hurt? Insider criticisms?

I lost my job because my coworker tried to fight me over some dumb argument about sidework and corporate fired both of us because of it. I didn’t do anything wrong, I just got caught up in a bad situation. 

My bf left me at his house all alone yesterday to run some errands and I ended up smoking the rest of the gram we bought. He used $100 given to him by his grandma and I only threw in $20 of my own cash since he owes me at least $40 from the times I’ve bought for us. (EDIT: I didn’t smoke the entire g, we had smoked most of it the night before but had about a point left. That’s what I smoked while he was gone, we probably each smoked half of the g in total.)

Since we were re upping later that afternoon I thought it’d be okay if I smoked the rest. When he came home he was super upset, he refused to talk to me which made me sob uncontrollably and then kicked me out while I was trying to nap because his friend was coming over.

Now I’m at my parents house feeling withdrawals starting up, no job, only $20 to my name, and possibly no boyfriend either. I’ve isolated myself from all my friends and haven’t really talked to my family in months, I’ve just been coming home every so often to get clothes then going back to my boyfriends.

This sounds dramatic but I am fully prepared to off myself if my boyfriend actually breaks up with me. He’s my only friend right now, and he’s my only way to stay well if he decided to still share with me. But he’s so angry with me over smoking his dope (that I genuinely thought we were sharing) that I don’t even know what to do. I’ve apologized a thousand times.

So I missed a big shot of dope a week ago, Friday night I think. I still have a lump in my arm, it's gotten a bit softer. The area is red and slightly warm to the touch, not as hot as it was a couple days ago though. I circled the lump with a sharpie, it hasn't grown in three days and remains the size of a silver dollar.


So while it hasn't gotten worse I'm still worried. I mean a simple miss would be gone by now right? Yet here the lump is...

What should I do? I bought subs and took a break from shooting up since I don't want to compromise my immune system right now (might be overkill). Do I wait for it to get worse and then hit the ER? How painful is draining it? Is this even an abscess if there's no streaks, temperature increase or excruciating pain in the area?

On the other end, people could sign up as Narcan holders, so when the alert goes it, it can go to emergency services, any numbers you've configured, and any Narcan holders in the vicinity.

I fucking hate myself.

So payday was today, and my hours amounted to 99.45 for the past two weeks, but because I work for a disgusting fat cum-stain of a human, five were lost cause I smoke a cigarette or two a day, while the other 14 that should've been overtime were paid in cash while shorting me eight bucks, which is small, but it's the principle.

And that motherfucker didn't give me my hour breakdown until I bitched, at which point he provided a falsified breakdown so that it looks like he ain't robbing both me and the IRS, if I were to go to the labor board.

Cocksucker tells me to take it or leave it, and I mean, it's not like I'm not gonna grab bulk tonight. 

Everyone says, ""Damn CPTKO, I can't belive you've worked were so long. Why do you stay here?""

And it's like, cause I need this. I'm almost dead inside from it all. I spend damn near every cent I make numbing myself, in the past having my girl spike me in the parking lot, and now smoking on the way and back from deliveries.

I hate myself for being in this situation, working for an asshole who's destroying a once successful restaurant that I love, and letting him fuck me financially the whole time.

I hate busting my ass just to be shit on. It kills me everytime that fuck treats me like nothing. Putting in all this time when I could call my parents and beg them to cover my tuition to get my associates, at least my time would mean something and id be better off and in a better situation. Course then I wouldn't have enough money to stay well and get through the classes. 

At the very least the cooks tell me I wouldn't even get over 40 hours in another restaurant. That I'm better off taking it raw than fucking off somewhere else.

If there was ever a pain patient I'm the postrer boy. I spent a couple years going to shady doctors to get my script (480 mg/day of oxy). Then one day in 2014 I shattered my leg beyond recognition. They couldn't even get me into the ambulance after a mainline of 100 mics of fent. They ended up jamming 40 mg of ketamine into me to knock me out. Long story short its taken over 3 years and 15 surgeries to get to a place where my leg is working. well over those 3 years I supplemented with dope in between surgeries. Even in the hospital post op they were giving me 8 blues a day, a mg of hydro morphone IV, and 15 mg of K every couple hours. its been just about a year since my last surgeries. I wrecked 2 mini coopers driving around on benzos and opiates, became a drunk. 2 DUIs and none of them involved alcohol...

Anyways, last fall i decided fuck i, after 3 weeks of withdrawal I went to the methadone clinic. I was on 190 mg/day when I quit cold turkey in may. for the first couple weeks I felt decent. then bam full blown w/d. that went on for a couple more weeks. I 've tried to use kratom in the past to no avail. but for some reason this time it actually helped. I used it pretty steady for a few days. Now the bag is just sitting in the cupboard And I'll use it for PAWS. I think quitting alcohol helped a lot. I make bad choices when drinking.

So anyways thats my story with the dancing with the devil. Plenty of ODs, paramedics giving me narcan, friends doing the same. But I'm on the other side now, and it feels really good. I'm motivated, back in the gym, strengthening my leg, I can feel music again, along with cool breezes. Life is actually worth living again.

The dentist I went to is some older lady (late 40s / early 50s) in a conservative rural area of the Midwest.

Finish the procedure and find out I'm getting fucking Tylenol, that's it. So once I figure out that I'm not getting vicodins or anything that actually gets me high, I told her this.

""Listen , I understand that you don't wanna jeopardize your business by giving out too many opioids given all that's going on. But I think it's ridiculous that I'm only getting tylenol for something that's really quite painful. I don't know who's fault it is, but its silly and most people I know have gotten something that actually works to treat pain after similar procedures.""

Her response: ""Tough luck kid""

Now I was expecting something measured, defensive and reasonable but knowing that I'm not gonna get any drugs combined with this bitches attitude kinda set me off.

My response: ""Haha, well you know what? Luckily I know some friends with older relatives who will sell me their oxycodone and fentanyl patches! I'm also gonna go buy some weed once I get home."" (my state doesn't even have medical yet)

Then she gives me the shittiest look I think I've ever received. Like she wants to poison me or something. 

I didn't really catch all of what she said next because I was kinda woozy, but it was basically a mini-rant about respecting the law, buying scripts is illegal, drugs are bad blah blah blah. I was reminded of the Mr. Mackey teacher guy from South Park saying ""drugs are bad mmmkay"". Then she shooes me away and I pay then leave. 

I kinda feel bad for being shitty about it but doctors need to understand that opiates are cool and much more useful for treating pain than fuckin tylenol & advil. Imo addiction is a responsibility issue that falls on the user alone, not some doctor or random pharma company.

I'm getting it cheaper this way than through my old dude so he isn't upcharging. I get more for my money, better quality, and better quantity. It's the best.

Anyways, today hasn't been so great. Messaged him around 3 to ask about going to pick up. He had just got paid and was down so he hit up the dude. Didn't hear back from him until around 5 when he told me that he had to let dboy borrow his car to reup and that as soon as he gets back he got me. He'd bring me the shit so i wouldn't even have to leave the apartment.

Long story short, it's 11:21 at night now and he still hasn't come. Dboy already got back from the reup and my dude has already left dboy's place, but now he's saying he's caught up trying to sell a dude some ice but that he still gots me 10000000000&#37;

Long time lurker, first time poster under a new account but I had a quick question because I've been searching Google for 24 hours and keep seeing differing information.

I've been taking between 360mg & 450mg of Oxycodone daily for a LONG time & my buddy wanted to get rid of his new script of 30mg G77 Oxymorphone for super cheap so I said, ok, to save money.

Every post I see about Oxymorphome says 4.5 x stronger than Oxycodone if taken intranasal and 2x of taken orally. So I can do basic math here but then there is a 50% increase of taken around the time you eat and a possible 70% to 300% increase around alcohol.

I see people saying that doing a single 30mg ER is TOO MUCH even for someone with a tolerance and that doing even 3 of them a day is potentially lethal.

I wound up spacing 3 out over 24hrs just doing 15mg here and there but never felt anything but was able to get some sleep.

Now am I just being TOO careful here or with my insane tolerance of Oxycodone would doing a single 30 mg oxymorphone er be typical to the normal 3 to 5 30mg Oxycodone dose I am used to doing at one time?

There are just so many stories of people saying 10mg of Oxynorphone floored them but no one says what their ACTUAL tolerance looks like.


SHORT VERSION: I typically do 3 to 5 30mg Oxycodone at a time for a total of 360 to 450mg a day. How much Oxymorphone ER 30mg G77 am I looking at for a dose and daily total?

The other opioid crisis is when we can't legitimately get our prescriptions for our legitimate pain. The doctors shoot you down when you complain of pain. 

All they want to do is send a script for some anti-inflammatory. I have kidney and liver damage, but they refuse to give me something that won't make the damage even worse.

People in pain have the right not to be, and I think it's malpractice when a doctor doesn't help you to a reasonable extent. Even more often I've seen older people taken off their meds cold turkey, and they want to die because of the pain.

I don't and have never lied about my pain, but the doctors think I do. Hell, they can hook me up to a lie detector and ask if the pain is real.

Another month of pooping everyday to the point where I have to sit down to piss, no joke. And due to a high-but-still-somehow-low tolerance, cutting my strips to not be sick and project vomit all over the floor. Mainly just a ride until my 20 80mg oxy capsules pop up (pack ofc, photos will come) from the dwm's. 

Which brings me to the ever-lingering question. So, if I accidently take too MUCH suboxone and I'm puking all over the place like the exorcist. Will Narcan help or no? I'm asking because I have a pouch of it and I'm wondering if that would help in such an extreme predicament. I know that traditional anti-nausea medicine doesn't really help because I have a strong power of suggestion, and thus can continue vomiting essentially losing the Zofran. The only way I'd know for sure it would work would be to IV some Zofran. A hospital may do this, given suboxone's 24-hour half-life. 

They've done it before but for different circumstances.  ",1530931472.0

Also found kratom and benzos (benzos weren't his DoC).. looks like maybe he was detoxing himself at some point..

It's been confusing because he really seemed clean. In twelve step program, he was the life and helped so many people. No matter what, he had learned to love in a special way unlike anyone I know (unconditionally basically).

Just confusing.. apparently he had been really really skilled in the past at seeming to be doing well and being functional, using without a sign.

I'm confused about how he could do that so well, and also love recovery and that life and be so genuine in so many ways, yet have this thing going on underneath. I think he was dissappointed and didn't want to dissappoint those he loved.

A kinda fucked up thing (among others) about the 'program' is that it becomes such a lifeline and a community of loving people that we're afraid to lose it... Some people just cut you off if you relapse... Makes me sad to think about it.

If anyone has thoughts about how you can maintain a lot of genuine quality of interactions but still use I'd love to hear it.

Or thoughts about just how painful it would be to have to live a double life but love the better part of it.

Or thoughts about whether it'd be at all possible for someone with a serious history of addiction to just use once or twice, detox themselves, and then use again months later.. kind of hoping that's how it went.

(Kind of related, I'm also wondering if anyone ever uses kratom and benzos to get themselves through a dry spell, not just detoxing. :/ )

And today I want to do it last time with the last pills I have and planning on doing 25mg orally. And maybe add another 10mg a hour later. 

Would that be a wise idea ? How dangerous is this and will I even feel anything today ?

I have some very high quality heroin right now I live on the east coast so it is ecp, tested negative for fent on test strips and I believe to be the highest purity in my area(have tried many many different plugs/batches/friends stuff) readily dissolves in water with no heat just a little stirring,vinegar smell etc all really really good signs of high quality so I know thats not the issue..

I should mention I snort it, and wastefully smoke it sometimes (just like the ritual of smoking i think) and my girlfriend also snorts with me, she gets pin point eyes super itchy little nod (far less tolerant than I) all the usual... 

I can understand tolerance affects it but even if I raise my dose pretty heavily I still don't feel anything like she does or how I used to feel.. I don't know if maybe your nose stops absorbing so much after so long? Or what i've tried potentiators, I even boofed it last night which I hate things near my booty hole so that sucked but all I got was kinda that familiar body high I could only compare to iv'ing when you get the rush at first, and it lasted like 10 minutes.. 

Idk I just feel almost like im just keeping a sickness away now and I dont do anymore than like 20mg in one line and never have.. IV'ing is out of the question I told myself id never touch the needle again and my girlfriend would be crushed so I need some ideals from the family!",1530898441.0

(Heroin & Ketamine),"I’ve dug around reddit quite extensively, along with the usual interwebz sites and haven’t found  much info on, what I’m calling a Kittyball (heroin & Ketamine.  Probably because there are very very very few people that IV Ketamine.  I find there are 2.5 types of people out there when it comes to K. (1)  don’t like it at all, will even turn it away when it’s free. (2) these people are more than happy to accept that free spoon/key you offer them (and will generally seek you out an hour later for another) but rarely, if ever, have their own. (3) - where I reside - absolutely love it. Understand how to dose themselves properly for the given situation.  Seldom can k-hole, generally due to residual tolerance and/or knows Ketamine is the most fun, most euphoric, most weird by flirting with the hole but never entering it,  I would much rather have a few drinks and do a few bumps of k than a few bumps of Coke (either at home or at a bar) any day of the week!

So what I’m looking for is basically dosage recommendations for mixing dope and k in the same shot (I have done k IV more than a few times, all were incredibly euphoric and enjoyable).  But I am assuming, in the same manner as a speedball, since the drugs will synergize each other...dosages will have to be modified appropriately.  (My current Ketamine tolerance is very low but my current dope tolerance is pretty high, shooting 3-5 bags of very good quality, what you would call ECP (from the southern part of the tri-state area).

Maybe balling them isn’t the most optimal way? (Slash would like to shoot coke until it was gone...as that’s what happens when you shoot coke hahah, and use dope afterwards...though I’ve heard some people prefer to use dope then coke.  Personally I like the POW you get when balling them...nothing quite like it in the world).
Should I back off the dope, use even less Ketamine IV (which when done alone is already quite a small amount).  

Any experience, insight, links to pages I may have missed, etc would be of great help...and when all is said and done will share the experience with the fam.  ",1530863777.0

Ever since then I had not been able to stop thinking about that amazing heroin experience, up there with my first high purity meth experience.

My whole life I've been able to find connects for ANY drug I've needed but opiates were the one thing that always alluded me -- could never find a steady connect. I always thought this was a blessing in some way.

Here I am, graduated and working in a big city and finally I stumble upon an H/occasional oxy connect. Been using at least a bag (0.1) a day with some oxys, xans, coke, etc for the past 2 months. I realize I'm becoming totally addicted now. Money is not an issue which somehow makes this even worse but my connects gone missing and I'm running out of my stash very fast.

Bad area for wounds - despite going to wound care and taking copious amounts of antibiotics, they have repeatedly gotten reinfected.

Needless to say, I have been dealing with A LOT of pain. There are plenty of bad days when I can barely walk.

Unfortanately, pain control has been a major issue. While I am in the hospital, I am usually good. They have good hospitalists where I go and knowing my tolerance and seeing my old charts, they usually give me 20-30mg of Oxycodone every 4-6 hours + IV morphine or hydromotphone for breakthrough pain.

When I get out though, I am screwed. Thus far, I have been sent home with scripts ranging from 20 800mg Ibuprofens or 12 5/325 Percs to at best, 24 5mg Oxycodones or 12 15mg Oxycodones. Since they are hospitalists, I cannit follow up with them. Wound Care will not prescribe narcotics and the three primary care doctors I have seen have AT MOST given me a couple days worth of 5/325 Vicodins or Percocets.

Part of the issue I know is my ""checkered"" medical history. But I am in LEGIT pain - any doctor can see the GAPING wounds and if they look at my chart, they can see this is an ongoing issue. Even so, it would take me 6-8 weeks just to see a Pain Management doctor.

In addition, the state I live in just passed a new Opiate Epidenic law. Non-Pain Management doctors cannot prescribe new patiebns more than 90 Morphine Mg equivalents per day. They use a 2:1 ratio, so that is ONLY 45mg of Oxycodone. Scripts cannot be for more than 5 days and some pharmacies, like Wal Mart, have their own policies not to fill scripts for more than 50 morphine mg equivalents (that is less than 3 Perc 10s per day). While their are exceptions to the new law, the state makes these doctors jump through 20 hoops to get there. It is asinine.

For the past 6 days, I have been in the hospital AGAIN! I had my two groin wounds re opened and the re infection cut out. Cue more pain!

As such, I was shocked today. The doctor I have beem seeing in the hospital was real cool - PLUS he has his own practice. Even though it is risky for him to do so, when he discharged me, he actually spent a couple hours jumoing through the state's hoops and gave me a 7-day prescription for 20mg Oxycodone to be taken every 4 hours. I have no intention of abusing this - I only want to be pain free or at least have manageable pain.

Plus, I am able to see him in a week - he made the appt and told me we can work together to manage my pain until my wounds are healed or this ordeal is over. That could easily be another 2-3 months. Even so, I am BEYOND HAPPY to have a TRUE AND COMPASSIO MNATE doctor - for the first rime in months, I see a light at the end of the tunnel of this ordeal!!!",1530846237.0

I've ate, snort and IV'd It. There is no opiate warm rush, but a strong feeling of calm hits hard when IV. Snorted and orally is similar, but slower and milder.  When doing my research, I found no report about how much it hurts when snorted! O God, a cough any eyes full of tears. So I started IV, but tolerance build fast and I've tried up to 37 mg IV and didn't get an awesome rush. I kept reading reading and found that a lower pH helps with water solubility. I IV'd with some  acetic acid from vinegar, with better results, but nothing extraordinary. 

So, as snorting hurt so much, I decided to prepare **sloth water**, which is a similar acidic solution to ""monkey water"" with this unique water soluble benzo.

I am experienced in using Ketamine intramuscularly, and while I went through a brief phase of chronic use-until-its-gone, I ultimately moved on from that.

Furthermore, this morphine is something I want to have on hand for my adventure bag, in case anything goes wrong in the wilderness and I need something strong to keep my head on. 

So my question, is this advisable for a first timer? I am what you would call a drug nerd, I am not a fiend but I use considerably more than a non [user.](https://user.So) So assuming I get some of this morphine to have on hand, and I try 10mg IM while I'm on vacation, is it really likely that I develop a habit?

The difference between heroin laced with fentanyl and regular heroin is HUGE. fent heroin lasts for around an hour, and is wayyy more intense, stronger, and more euphoric. after 1-2 hours, intense cravings begin. after a day of doing fent dope, I find that the next day I an extremely stressed and on edge. the only thing I can do is get more.

REAL HEROIN comes on nice and SLOW. it is NOT intense. it is a very mild and warm LOADS of itching. these effects can last from 6 to 8 HOURS before cravings begin.

Honestly I feel like fent is the crack form of heroin, and cocaine would be regular diamorphine. I do like heroin more even though it is less euphoric. much more pleasant. most stamp baggies in the southeast are a high concentration of fentanyl and have hardly any diamorphine.

We never knew what caused her to swerve. 

This past week I was going through some old documents and came across the toxicology report from her autopsy. I had read it before and had talked to the coroner, but I did not at the time understand the drug levels and the coroner did not mention them. The report shows that she had:

hydrocodone .24 mg/L
carisoprodol (soma) 4 mg/L

From my googling, .24 mg/l of hydrocodone seems like a massive amount... up to 6x the therapeutic dose, and within range of a lethal amount.  I know that much depends on indiv tolerance, etc. 

Is it possible to know what .24 mg/L in the blood translates to in terms of number of 5mg vicodin tablets?

And is the effect of hydrocodone impacted by the presence of Soma? 

Am trying to determine how reasonable it is to assume that the cause of her death was related (even if in part) to the meds.

... I haven't been an active member in the sub for long, but from what I can tell, you're all fuxking awesome & honestly support each other- So I thought I'd bite the bullet & just ask...

I had a close friend since I was 13, though he lived in America & I'm in Australia - we were in constant contact for nearly 20 years....

We shared so much of our critical development together - it's safe to say that I loved this precious boi like a brother.... (he taught me so much, about- so much.... esp drugs, eating disorders & mental health issues)- I talked & gamed with him through withdrawls, & episodes of self harming, we'd talk all kinds of shit at all hours.... he truly was my best friend, someone I could be 100% honest with about *everything*....

.... he struggled with ED's,  as well as addiction & depression /anxiety... We supported each other through some crazy suicidal moments...

He ended up fathering 2 little girls (with 2 different but amazing mums)- & he loved them so much... so so soooo much.... They brought so much live, joy, peace, innocence, happiness- just- all the good things babies bring , into his life <3 I know they meant more than the multiverse to him...

But he was a mentally ill addict =( & he eventually lost his life because of it.... 

I am devestated for the loss of someone I love & relied on so much, but I am even more devestated for his daughters....

I want them to know that their daddy loved them more than anything ... They are growing up so fast, & their understanding of the situation is no doubt going to change too....

Sorry- I guess what I'm trying to ask you folks- is- 

What would you say to children/young kids who lost a parent who was a suicidal addict??

How do you help make sure that they never feel like it is their fault / they weren't enough to keep daddy around?? (Kid logic is crazy)

I know he loved his daughters- beyond everything! I don't want them to *ever* feel like daddy loved drugs more than he loved them...

 I watched him struggle, fight & suffer so much over the years... - & once his daughters were born, whenever he spoke about being suicidal - we would talk about how his little girls needed their dad around- He tried to survive... he really did... 

Kids shouldn't have to bear the burden of their parents issues - but they've already lost their dad, I just want them to *know* even more as they grow up - that they are worth living for- & his death doesn't mean he didn't love them enough to live for them....

God I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say here.... ='(


I'm sure plenty of folks in this group have lost friends / family - have any of you had to talk with kids about it?? 

*any* words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated  <3

If anyone read this far down, Thank you <3

Just as a precaution - we HAD narcan and it didn’t work because his blood pressure was so low, it couldn’t pump the narcan to his heart (I’m assuming). He then went into cardiac arrest at the hospital, fell into a coma, and never woke up. Brain scan showed zero activity. And the sickest thing is all I want to do is get high. 

Anyone have that one friend who you could count on for anything? The one friend who always split the bag evenly. The one who never lied or stole from me. The one who always answered the phone at 3am.

8wceic,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8wceic/how_methadone_has_helped_me/,8,https://redd.it/8wceic,nodsquadlife,how methadone has helped me,"Tldr- I found a clinic that has dispelled all the horrible things I heard about clinics.

I used to never believe in addiction, I had many friends who went too far, several died and I still chalked it up to a mistake or lack of control.  I fucked around with all sorts of drugs including opiates and never really had any issues I couldn't handle but 3 years ago I got in al car accident where I herniated discs in my back.  So pain management became a part of my life.  

Then back in October my doc told me about how federal laws were changing and that he wasn't going to be able to continue prescribing my meds and talked about referring me to a pain clinic.  I had at this point started buying pills and heroIn and formed a fairly problematic issue with opiates.  I looked up the pain clinic online and it was horrific review after horrific review about how you're treated like a criminal and how expensive the visit was.  Went in and it did feel like I was on trial.  In addition to how much each appointment cost they had a ton of others things they wanted me to do that also would cost a small fortune none of which was covered by my insurance.  I was telling my friend about it he told me about the methadone clinic he went too and how awesome it was.  

Now I heard the same thing about clinics that I heard about pain clinics, that you were basically treated like shit.  I told him what the hell if I dislike it I'll just leave and go the pain management route.  When I went in I was shocked at how much this methadone clinic helped work with people like me.  There were a lot of patients there because of pain management as well as people who were not.  Not that that matters to my clinic, they treat everyone with the same respect.  I was shocked at how kind they were and understanding.  

The methadone after I got to my therapeutic dose took away the cravings to the point now where I haven't abused my pain pills that I still get for flair ups, my muscle relaxer seems to work better as well. I've even slipped up a couple times and used heroin and they didn't get angry or phish me, just supported me.  All of my doctors and therapist are all working together and overall I'm in a very different place than I was six months ago.  I was pretty scared of my health team being mad with me for hiding stuff but they are all have my back and that feels good.   I know I'm lucky in this respect and that this is not how it goes a lot of the time but my hope is that My experience becomes the norm.

My uncle just had his pcp tell him he wasn't going to be able to keep prescribing him painkillers and he went to a pain clinic and they put him on methadone.  He is having a completely different experience then me and it's not pretty.  His experience has been similar to the terrible stories you hear.

I know my clinic is kinder than most, smaller than most and has helped me more than I can really say.  They are all about harm reduction and letting you have the say in your treatment.  They have never been mad when I have tripped up, only supportive.  I hope more treatment and clinics go this direction because I don't feel like a criminal there, I don't feel judged there and that has  allowed me to come to terms with the change in quality of life that I wasn't dealing with.  Anyways love this sub and its accepting, supportive and caring community.  I think anyone wanting to work in the field of addiction treatment should actively read this sub as it has so many insight into addiction and more importantly the people who suffer from it. 

Hope y'all have a good one, I wish you all the best where ever you are, however you are,  you are beautiful, maybe beautifully broken but beautiful none the less. Thanks

Naturally....(said in voice of dude from Requiem for a dream)... I’m just another horny, white, twenty something year old male from the north east; tri-state area. I have no problem with spittin game and getting laid but screwing a hooker has always intrigued me. Yes, as in I want to pay for sex. Alright maybe I really only got laid once this year. Anyways enough about that... I had an 💡 so let me know what you all think.

So I have a really solid connect, older black dude with kids, lives in the hood, just trying to feed his family. We are on good terms and I do him favors sometimes; you know, shit like pick up his lil brother for an extra bun, etc. He once called me his nigga and I really took that as a compliment... that was a pretty sweet day hah. Like my street cred leveled up or someshit.

Ok so my question is, would it be weird if I asked my dude if he knew any “legit” prostitutes that I could meet? I have cold copped in different hoods safely and successfully...so I’m sure if I really tried.... I could cold cop a hoe. BUT I had this great idea to just ask my dude. Has anyone ever asked their dude that? Would it be weird thing to ask? I don’t wanna lose the “my nigga” street cred..... or my connect.

tldr;
Can I ask my connect if he can set me up with a hooker who isn’t gonna rob or kill me? Bonus points if she looks sexy and doesn’t make my shit drip drip drip?

P.s. Of course I only had this 💭 recently.. and just today or yesterday my dude got locked up on some dumb shit... child support or whatever. So I currently go through his wife who is also super cool and nice to me. Actually.... maybe she might know better than him right? She is a girl and all, and girls definitely be gossiping.. that’s just facts. But yeah I could always just wait til he gets out and ask him instead.

Call your senators and tell them you oppose the SITSA and SCREEN act.  It takes 10 seconds, its easy to find the numbers for your senators.. it makes all the difference.

I'm no stranger to drugs, with that said, I'm looking for advice on a situation with a friend.

SWIM is 25, been using (injecting) heroin amoung other drugs for an easy 4 years. Beautiful girl in a hard spot. I've made my feelings known that I like her, and I would be interested in a relationship but only after I see her cleaned up and imptove her life.

I would like to help. I don't want to get used, and my life is much more stable and too busy to even try to deal with her issues on my own.

I was informed the Ex-boyfriend has been hit with assault charges amoung others from a recent fight they had. I am fully aware I only got half of the story, her side. I'm thinking, good for you, as a friend, no one deserves to be abused & it's an important step for her to change her life and cut out toxic people. I'm highly encouraging she cut people out, change her phone number and start fresh with new contact list for a new life.

I've mentioned a addiction treatment facility as an option. Of course She'd rather do it herself. She told me she's been on Suboxone for a few days. I'm not sure what this entails, if it could help her or hurt in the long run. Needless to say it's not prescribed. 

I think this girl is really awesome she has a two bedroom apartment to herself - but I don't even want to know how she affords it. I want to see her do better, be clean. I'd even be okay if she got clean and didn't want to pursue a relationship with me. I'm only interested in maintaining a relationship or friendship with her if I see life changes. I expect to get hurt, because I know how terrible addiction can be.

I was considering offering to take over her rent / watch her cat / stay at her place for a month, if she would check into and complete a 30 day opiate addiction program. I feel like the only way that would work is if everyone is supporting her from me, to who she wants to call ""friends"" and her family. If she goes for it when I discuss it, I'll deffinitly push to meet her family members and get them in the loop as to what's happening, that she needs help and I'm willing to do what I can.

I am aware of the dangers of enabling. She hasn't asked and I will not give her money. I don't use hard drugs myself and I don't want that around in my life. She's an awesome person, and I would like to see her recover.

What should I expect?


I'm not sure if she has any kind of health insurance, worst case, what would be a ball park estimate of treatment cost for 30 day inpatient care?

Links to non-profits or treatment centers would be appreciated.

Any tips in dealing with the concern that she's relapsed, if getting clean ever becomes a reality?

Is it possible to wean oneself off of opiates and eventually stop the hard drug habits?

It's a struggle every day, when you start recovery it really never ends. She inspires me to better my life & I'm pretty solid and in control of my situations, goals and what not, but how can I inspire that in her?


Thanks for any replies.
The most obvious one is GTFO, but I have found myself willing to try to help if only briefly and very firmly.

Especially in that little round indent on the flat part of the cap. Figure all 60 prob got me iono .1-.15 hard to measure since it’s just smear on each but it took 5 cotton tips to get it all. 

Anyway I felt no rush but can swear I felt much better almost instantly. I’ve been taking just enough sub that I’m not puking/shitting but don’t have much and thought my direct deposit was coming through today till I realized it’s the 4th (been mostly in bed for few days except for a 2 am bike ride last night as I’ve been half sick so sorta spaced the back holiday thing - though real banks won’t touch me with a ten foot pole anymore I guess green dot works the same since all deposits go through some federal system)

I guess the reason for post is do you think I’m good to take lil more sub if needed before my pay clears ? As I’m pretty sure that shot is felt even with slipping out for a second luckily I was using a lot of water so as to get cottons clean as possible. 

Thoughts on if I’d kick into PW?

Friend is a heavy methadone user and has been experiencing extreme panic attacks between doses (5+ @ a time) and they seem to go away once they kick in but, was hoping for a little insight from the fine and more experienced people from this sub.

My question is; does this have anything to do with potential withdrawal symptoms from the methadone or something else entirely?

Awhile back, I told my family about my habit, and I’ll be honest I didn’t get the type of feedback or anything that I was expecting. No ridicule, no punishment - it almost seemed as if it wasn’t a problem? Maybe bc it’s just pills and not the big scary H word, but fuck I’m thinking maybe I should go to rehab..

Like at what point do you go to rehab? I’m not at rock bottom, and even though money isn’t an issue I don’t want to keep spending it on pills.

Preface: 

I’m in my early 20s, a straight A student living with his girlfriend, and starting his second year of business school (I plan to go into accounting). I wasn’t always doing this well though. I had a heroin addiction from around 14 yrs old to about a year and a half ago when I met my girlfriend. At first it was sporadic use, whenever I had money, but as I got older and made more money it progressively got worse, eventually culminating when I got a large insurance settlement a few years ago and really went off the deep end. I met my girlfriend near the end of that money when being sick was now something I had to worry about whether I could afford to fix of not. She had done drugs but never anything heavy and hated my heroin habit but never said anything because we weren’t dating yet. 

After a few months of us hanging out and me progressively heading downhill she showed up at my house sobbing in the middle of the night saying how much I meant to her and how she couldn’t stand seeing me like this. If I wanted to have anything with her in the future this had to end now. Ok. I really cared about this girl and honestly did see a future with her so I did it. Went and flushed what I left down the toilet (oh fuck me did that hurt inside), told her okay I’m ready to make a change, and calmed her down to sleep. 

Now luckily enough this lined up with me leaving down to go help set up a new location for the company I work for. I knew I’d have to leave town to really have a shot at being clean and was looking at this like a paid rehab. Oh fuck was it bad. Being sick in an I heated building during  he middle of winter.... fuck me. I died for the first week, but managed to keep my shit together enough to get work done and after that it got better. (I’ve never gone to an actual treatment facility, but did sober myself up for periods over the years so I knew what I was in for. My idea was always cold turkey or nothing, what’s the point in being sober if I still need to take something to be normal. No everyone’s route but it’s what worked for me). 

When I got home after the location had opened I knew I couldn’t go ham out with most of my friends or I’d relapse. Of course this happened anyway. Twice. My girlfriend found out both times (I didn’t hide anything when asked about it). At this point we were planning on moving to a different city together to go to school and she told me if I was going to use again that she would not be living with me and that our relationship was effectively over. This hit me hard because I had really fallen for her at this point. I did it. I fucking did it. I cut all the people off that I knew I’d use with and just put my head down and worked to save money for the move, which went off without a hitch half a year later.

The fucking bag in the elevator: 

Fast forward a year and a half. We’re both going to school, doing well, and living on our own for the first time in a new city. Of course like any couple we have issues occasionally, and sometimes with the added stress of college we can both be a bit on edge, but we both love each other and generally work things out. This was in the middle of one of those tense periods. She was at work till late and I was just getting home from a late study session. 

I get in the elevator and press my floor, looking around the elevator as I always do when I notice a baggy sitting in the corner. Naturally I pick it up. I kind of hid it in my hand till I got in my suite Incase anyone else got it the elevator but I already knew what it was just by looking at it. Once I was inside one quick smell of that disgustingly delicious vinegar scent and I knew I was fucked. 

I had been doing everything I could to avoid it. I didn’t communicate or see any of my old friends that used, I kept as busy as I fucking could, I avoided anywhere I thought I might encounter dope. I DID EVERYTHING I FUCKING COULD HAVE TO STAY CLEAN. And here in my elevator on my home I find a goddamn bag of dope. Fuck me. 

You know I did some. How could I not?  It had been so long, I wanted to so bad, and it seemed like it had found its way to me instead of the other way around. Foil, lighter, hootie, dragon, hold, exhale. Fuck. It was so easy. My brain didn’t even work during that half a minute. Not a single thought. But after I exhaled and sat in my bliss for a few seconds it finally did. 

What about your girlfriend? What about your career and education that you have so much time and effort invested in now? What about your life that you’ve managed to turn 180 degrees in past two years? I felt horrible and ashamed of myself. I had worked so hard and it all just crumbled within a minute. 

So before I smoked the rest of it to suppress my guilt I tried to do the right thing. I called my long time friend who has known me since before heroin took over my life and has always supported me through it (and who coincidentally was coming to visit me the next day for the first time since I’d moved). I explained the situation and was met with two words : flush it. “How is it even a question?” She asked. I don’t know, it just is. It’s so hard to explain. She said “hang up the phone, go to the bathroom, and take a video of you flushing it and then send it to me.” I hung up, took another huge dragon because fuck it I had already messed up, and went and made the video (oh fuck me did that hurt inside, again). She called back, said how proud she was that I did that, wished me luck explains it to my girlfriend, and that she’d see me tomorrow. 

I spent the next two hours cleaning up furiously so the only thing she could possibly be upset about when she got home was me and my weak will. It sucks because when she came home she was so happy and ready to be home and relax and I knew I was going to take that away. 

I told her. She was upset, really upset and rightfully so. I had broken my commitment. The rest of the night was horrible, she sat crying while I sat trying to feel anything at all other than numb. She asked me wtf went through my head before doing it and I was honest: nothing. I knew it was the wrong answer but fuck me if I wasn’t going to be as honest as I could about this whole thing. It’s not that I didn’t think of her and our life, it’s just that I didn’t think of anything period. 

The next day the friend I had called came to visit and my girlfriend opted out of doing something with us that day. I understood. I talked with her about how I felt this was such an improvement for me from where I was. The fact that I reached out and talked to someone who then helped me to get rid of the dope was real progress in my head. I never would have done that in the past. Unfortunately, to my girlfriend, just the fact that I did it seemed like a step back. It was. I’m not denying that. But I felt the positives were being ignored. My friend and I had a good day together and I went home that night.

I can tell my girlfriend is hurt and I promised that this wouldn’t happen again. But how do I know? How do I know that even if I do everything I can to stay clean that the universe won’t drop another bag of dope in my lap and shut my brain off until it’s too late? I don’t. And that’s the scariest part of addiction to me is that no matter how much better you think your doing when your in that position it all goes out the window. I have no intention of looking dope, and plan to continue to stay clean but there’s always that unknown factor you can’t predict.

If you read all that thank you. Feels good to get off my chest, and hopefully it relates to some of you. I guess my point is is if you’ve been doing good and you find yourself in a position like this and your brain can come up with the slightest shred of doubt before you cross that line: listen. Listen listen listen. Fuck me do I wish I had. 

TLDR: clean for 1.5 years and turned my life around then find bag of dope in my elevator, do it, realize old habits die hard, and feel like I took a huge step back.

I love the feeling more than I love almost anything else. I usually feel nothing, on a day to day basis. I used opiates for a long time, first to manage pain, and then to feel something other than nothing. Three years ago, I left a job because the stress was too much. I was spending about 1/4 of my check every week on pills and drowning myself in debt. I decided to get out, because if my family found out they would disown me and I'd have nothing.

I got a better job and started taking care of myself. Focusing on my debts and trying to handle my stuff. I've been mostly fine, but lately almost every night I've thought about getting back to it again... ""just to chill for a few hours"". I had cut ties with anyone who did that, so I wouldn't be tempted. But, recently I found out a good friend of mine has a junkie parent and some friends who share my love of opiates. I tried to get some from the friend, but they said their friend couldn't get any.

It sounds like I'm doing just fine, but there's a problem. I suffer from chronic pain. No discernible cause. I've been able to mostly ignore it the last few years, but my job is physical and I can feel the pain start to come back so much worse than before. I'm afraid to go see a doctor, because if they want to put me on opiates I KNOW I'm going to say ""okay"" and go with it. I know I could always say no, but I don't know if I want to. People say you eventually get used to the pain, but I think that's just wishful thinking.

I'm honestly wondering if it's possible that I REALLY want to be on opiates again. That my brain is basically lying to me and saying I'm in pain just so I can be high. I've used kratom before and it didn't do much, if anything, for me.",1530726340.0

I saw him yesterday and he tells me ""hey be very careful, this stuff hits hard"". This time it's a very light tan color and super fine powder. The bags look shitty like they've been laying around or just poorly put together, not to mention it looked like a couple of them had barely anything in them. Didn't get much of a high honestly.

Here comes the end to an interesting adventure. Opiate highlights include:

* Going behind the counter a few times to just look for what I needed at the pharmacy because no english
* Smoking heroin daily with a religious baba in India and making a movie with him
* ODing on Keta in the lobby of the hostel in Bolivia (not opi but still)
* Getting married to a stupid Australian girl which made me want to kill myself, so dranks tea a lot  
slept in a camp in Melbourne where my camp mates introduced me to it
* Super judged by the Japanese drug store employees for buying shit tons of Bron
* So much IV morphine in cambodia
* Threesomes on opiates make you a sex god
* So many withdrawals when changing countries, basically benzo-zombie walking through customs and waking up being like how the fuck did I get in
* Traveled with a juggling midget for awhile. Feel guilty because I think I got him started on the opis. His name is Kenny.

Overall, it was a pretty good trip. The Australian girl was total shit.

Probably will leave Mongolia in a week but don't have a ticket yet. It's either that or I'm back to India.

Homosexuals were thrown in prison and ostracized by their community to the point of total destruction of the persons life, both by the State, and by their own family/friends/coworkers/community. I mean, homosexuality wasn't even discussed in polite conversation during those times. The only time gays could even truly be themselves was when they went underground, talking only to other gays in fear of being caught, or quiet straight supporters who didn't make their support known. 

Nowadays, homosexuality, as well as many other numerous sexualities are widely supported by the population. There is still those who are against it, but they are generally the small minority, or are isolated in small rural towns far away from any major population center. Gays have no fear of the government, no fear of punishment. Generally in the US, and especially places like Europe or Canada, gays can live basically completely normal lives now, no fear of anything, besides the small chance of a homophobe encounter.

The same can be said about racism and other forms of bigotry.

But not for opiate users. See, we're so discriminated against, we're not even seen as a movement worth seriously considering as oppressed. The opiate community is in a stage similar to how gays were in the 1930s, we're so discriminated against, so hated, the average person doesn't even think there's any discrimination, it's all justified. To them, it's natural to hate opiates and their users, just like in the 1930s, the idea that gays were oppressed was laughable, because *why would gays NOT be oppressed*? It was the just and moral thing then. Just like now for the punishment of opiate users. We don't even ping on the average persons radar as a group worth pity or understanding.

We're attacked by the State. If an opiate user is discovered, they receive harsh jail sentences worse than homosexuals received, worse than many murderers and rapists receive. The State absolutely ruins many lives just the same as in the past discriminations.

If discovered by the community, the opiate user receives life destroying ostracism. When discovered, friends/family have their propaganda program activated, unleashing a mix of anger, guilt, shame, and betrayal on the opiate user, making them feel like less than human for their natural desires, trying to sabotage their use, and labeling them forever as a junkie.

If discovered by the wider community, all connections are tainted, and investigation by the State is possibly started. If discovered by work, either by a community member tattling, or by a drug test, or by any other method, firing is immediate, reputation is ruined, and the opiate user is taken back to square one.

It's not our fault we we're born with our desires. Just like homosexuals sexuality being unchosen by them, our desire to use opiates wasn't our choice.

Many will say: ""opiate users *choose* to use opiates, so they're responsible"". That is how the average person thinks. Problem is that average people don't have the brains of opiate users. Average people experience happiness automatically, doing normal things makes them fulfilled and euphoric. Opiate users have the choice of depression and anxiety sober, or they can take an opiate and feel normal and happy. The same things said about us were and are said about homosexuals ""it's their choice to do homosexual acts"". Yeah, and you would to if the only way you could experience sexual release and intimate love was if it was with someone of the same gender. The comment about it being opiate users choice is much the same. It's not our fault, and anyone would do it if given the same pleasure centers as the average junkie.

Not only are all the life problems of opiates due to society, but the health problems are too: just like homosexuality was once only dangerous because of it's illegality, when HIV rates skyrocketed, opiates are too. Being gay used to reduce lifespan because of the HIV rates incurred, among other things, because homosexuals were uneducated about homosexuality, because society kept it in the dark. A similar thing could be said about opiates. Because of society, opiate users are forced to do unhealthy things. When used properly, there is very little risk of physical harm. 

We are seriously second class citizens in a bigoted world. Even those who think they're accepting and empathetic still won't share that same one sided empathy with opiate users. It's not all drug users, because cannabis is now morally alright for the most part in the US, psychedelics are becoming more accepted (and are at least not hated), and stimulant users aren't really talked about. The most hated drug user group is opiate users, I mean, opiate users are even hated by OTHER drug using groups, like the potheads or psyche community, who all talk shit about opiates and their users.

We are seriously second class citizens. We have our liberties and rights taken away from us constantly. Using any drugs, opiates included, is protected by the US constitution, and there is no actual legal document anywhere which gives the government the rights it currently thinks it has.

I mean, think about it, the ONLY place we can even discuss our opiate use is with other opiate users, either IRL or online on forums like this. We're a small, secretive, closed off community that only feels safe in our small well hidden box. Think about it! We're like a bunch of gay men in a bathhouse in 1930, hiding away, constantly paranoid of being discovered. And like in 1930, there wasn't even a real cohesive opiate freedom movement. We're not the 1970s gay community, with a burgeoning movement of pro-gay poltical power, instead we're the gays of 1930, all we do is talk about how much the current conditions suck, and the majority of opiate users aren't even trying or considering fighting for legality. Like how the average homosexual in 1930 wasn't actively fighting for freedom, instead all they wanted to do was find a way to be gay and left alone, be gay and be safe from society. I don't see opiates becoming fully legal like alcohol or cigarettes in at least another 50 years, maybe 75. It's crazy how well that timeline lines up with the early 1900s gay community, it wouldn't be another 50-80 years until homosexuality was legal and mostly accepted... We're on the exact same timeline, our community is the same as there's was, and the timeframe is the same. That's the state the current opiate community is in right now. What we need isn't people guilty of being who they are, we need a community of people PROUD of who they are, and DEMANDING their FULL INALIENABLE RIGHTS.

I say we create that community, I say every opiate user should start fighting for legalization, fighting for freedom. Don't be afraid or guilty of wanting to be allowed to use opiates, don't back down from family/friends/society, don't feel guilty for saying what you're feeling, that you want to use opiates legally and without judgement. Most of you just want to be left alone to use your opiates, because you're guilty or afraid, don't be. Be like the homosexual rights community in the 80s, loud and proud, fighting for FULL freedom, not just the freedom to hide, but the freedom to use freely.

Our generation is not likely to be the ones who gets full legality of opiates, of course it depends on a lot of things. But full legality isn't even needed, trying to get opiates completely legal is getting ahead of ourselves. The most important things we need to do now, and which would give us 80% of the relief we deserve, is getting opiate use completely decriminalized, allowing opiates to be prescribed more easily, and having morphine/diamorphine maintenance therapy   become a common, if not the most common, ""treatment"" for opiate use. All three can be done, it's already done in some European countries as well as Canada. 

The first will get rid of the harsh punishments opiate users receive.

The second will people the ability to get prescribed opiates more easily.

And the third will allow users of opiates to simply get their desired opiate from the doctor.

The first and third are the most important.

We cannot afford to be scared anymore. It is time to be brave, and demand our freedom.

Hello everyone, I have come across a rather interesting situation to say the least. I'm home right now with the fam, and tomorrow we're throwing a 4th of July party. The rents just got a new bangin' house so we are celebrating that as well. We are inviting a bunch of family friends that I personally haven't seen in a long while.

None of that is interesting, I know, I'm getting there. 

My sister, who is 5 years younger than me and is still in high school, has a dilemma. A childhood friend of hers is coming over. This girl is almost 2 years younger than my sister.

My sister, though she'll deny it, is very uppity. Straight A student, clean as a whistle, very athletic, Christian, and has a very harsh view on drugs and promiscuity. A goody-two-shoes so to speak. Which is a great thing, she'll have a great life and I'm proud of her.

But this old friend of hers has a lot of issues. Issues that you and I are more familiar with. She's 16 and she's recently started doing heroin and coke. Heavily. Waking up on park benches in the bad part of town kind of heavy. 

Her dad is a piece of shit. A classic bartard that cheats on her mom constantly. Which really sucks because I used to think he was awesome growing up. 

Anyways, this girl acts out, and quite honestly I don't blame her. She sleeps around a lot, with older men, runs away from home, and is doing awful in school. 

My sister and her other friends have started to reject her, not wanting anything to do with her because of the way she acts. Today my sister referred to her as ""trash"". That sort of hit me hard. 

No one in my family knows the full extent of my debauchery, I've told them every drug I've tried, but if they knew the sheer amount? If they knew how I lived my life away from home? No doubt my sister would consider me ""trash"".

When that hit me, the first thought that came to my mind was ""I want to pull this girl aside and talk to her, I want to help her"". I'm an addict, closing in on 6 years of on/off usage of pills, 2 months clean as of right now but I'm still struggling. I know she's acting out because she's young and because of her situation. No one else seems willing to talk to her.

I guess my question is, do you think it would be ok if I pulled her aside to talk to her at this stupid party tomorrow? Would it be weird because I'm so much older than her? I just hate to see someone that age going through similar shit I had to deal with.

I dealt with it on my own for 3 years before I found someone I could talk to. I was on the verge of suicide! I don't want to see this girl kill herself or continue on this path feeling like she doesn't have anyone to talk to.

So would it be too weird to try and give her advice? If you think I should try, how should I go about it? ""Hey I heard you do heroin, we should talk"" sounds fucking creepy in my head. Any advice?

The time has come for me to put a new level of effort into staying clean and sober. I’ve been fucking around with this lifestyle for the last couple years, starting with something as innocuous as taking a couple of hydrocodone pills to smoking roughly a gram of black tar each day.

I’ve started to feel the effects in my lungs, I can’t handle the constant anxiety of scoring nor can I keep up financially, and I’m just plain tired of not even being able to get out of bed in the morning without putting something into my body. It’s been real, with some great times in between, but it’s time I walk away and get my shit together. I have too much going on at the moment to be going through withdrawals unexpectedly, needing money to stay right, and all of the other drama that surround this lifestyle.

I love all of y’all, I won’t be gone forever but this sub can be triggering and so I will be prioritizing self care - meaning you won’t be seeing me nearly as often. This time I really want to make this work and that means giving up more than just heroin, I’ve got to give up triggering temptations such as coming on here to salivate over dope porn or going to see my homeless friend while I weigh the pros and cons of grabbing “one last 20.” Hell, I even downloaded a sobriety calendar on my phone for the first time ever.

Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life, and I hope I can seize the day in a new way. Happy nods, my r/opiates family, please stay safe as you navigate the next challenge you face. You are unique, awesome, and so worthy of every good thing imaginable - no matter what anybody says.

Well, on [this season five episode of Babylon 5 - episode 8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0517643/), titled **Day of The Dead** they tackle addiction ever so briefly for the second time in the series.


The first time they dealt with addiction was when one of the main characters, a doctor, was addicted to stims. It took multiple episodes for that arc to come to a head but they covered all of the major stages. Another main character is a recovering alcoholic, and he has two relapses during the show.

&nbsp;

**Before you proceed further:**
#Spoiler alert
...

&nbsp;

In 'Day of the Dead', one of the alien species on the station is celebrating a holiday that comes once every 200 years. It's practically a rip off of the Mexican 'Dios des Morte'/'Day of the Dead' but when dealing with aliens, and perhaps some of their futuristic technology shit gets interesting.


Basically, different characters are going about their night time routines, some sleeping and being woken up when old dead friends, family members and lovers appear in their rooms - seemingly alive.

&nbsp;

The commander of the space station sees a friend in her room, someone who almost didn't recognize her because they died twenty years earlier. Turned out they died from an overdose. They wouldn't answer whether they did it on purpose when asked but maybe they'll flesh that out before the episode is over.


Even better, the dead best friend asks the commander if she had any stuff, ""we could have a little party."" The captain declined, then her BFF is like, ""didn't we have so much fun?""

The captain responds, ""no, we were cold, sick.. we were hungry all the time.  

&nbsp;

Fast forward to the end of the episode, the ""ghosts"" or ""electromagnetic anomalies"" begin to leave as the sun rises. 

The captains BFF finally admits that she did do it on purpose. ""I just couldn't go on, don't hate me.""

The captain gets to say right before her friend leaves for the last time, ""I could never hate you.""",1530679939.0

In 3 months he went from sniffing 1 every weekend and now tells me he does 4-5 a day and smokes them also. He’s been asking all my highschool friends who he hasnt spoken to since 2012 to send him $35 and he literally begs everyone with some sob story about being in overdraft and he needs 35 to get rid of it. He even gotten to the point where he is stealing redbulls and reselling them to pay for it. It shocks me how fast downhill he went. All his family knows he does it and he has nothing going for him at the moment. No job, no school, no nothing just 30s is all his lifes about. He comes from a black family so theres a huge stigma where he cant go to rehab and I want to stop him before he starts doing heroin. He tells he doesnt need rehab because he can stop anytime which is a fucking lie. He called me one day when stopped taking it for like 3 days and was begging me to get him a 30 to stop from being dopesick. What should I do to help him out? At this point I feel like I have to cut him off. Any advice fellow opiate users. Please let me know

edit: sorry about this long ass essay I just kept rambling.

TLDR: Friend is addicted to 30s and cant go to rehab. Im his only true friend and doesn’t want to listen to me. What should I do?

I got great replies about the simple question of which one is the most euphoric. [Thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8vds3k/euphoric_benzo/)

After considering all the facts, especially availability on the market, [posology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/posology) and ROA, I chose **midazolam**.

A big pro of midazolam is the fact that is snortable and possible to IV, and being a junkie with a needle fixations, that's a  plus. The big con is the price, my plug was for a blank script for USD$20, and the midazolam itself was USD$30 for 30 pills of 15 mg. Not cheap for Chile standards, and as a comparison, generic diazepam is USD$1 for 30 pills of 10 mg. But I went with it.

I proceed with my plan and score the beautiful pic you see. I crush and make two lines.

They have a blue kind of envelope, which I tried to separate from the rest of the valuable powder, because I'm sure that's not midazolam and it is some formulation release topic.

I snort. Oh shit it burns! Nobody told me that. Snort is the last on my list of ROAs, but I wanted to try this before BANG THAT SHIT, to experience a milder first encounter. After 1-3 minutes I start to feel a deep calm, it definitely works, and was very good with  the morphine I shot like an hour before this^(\*).

So, here I am, nodding like a mf in the library, having a good time.

Thanks for all the advice that made this an ""as safe as possible"" experience. A midazolam shot is coming when I'm safe at home.

Stay safe.
