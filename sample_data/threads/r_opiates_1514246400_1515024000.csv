I had a solid three and half years of ‚Äúclean‚Äù time in which I used heroin three times over that time span with about a year in between each use nbd.  Around last may I started chipping and that spiraled into full blown addiction again which I was able to hide for a while til I got sloppy (that fent dope is no joke).  Had a good 2-3 month clean spell and then my best friend since the 5th grade od‚Äôd and died. I took his loss very badly as I‚Äôm sure everyone can understand. Started using again here and there when I would get really sad and now that has turned into everyday for the last month or so. I‚Äôm afraid to go through withdrawal because she will know what‚Äôs up since she watched me go through it back in July. We live together so I can‚Äôt just say hey I‚Äôm busy with work/other things for a few days and kick alone.  I‚Äôm so torn on what to do I tried two weeks ago and caved less than 48 hours in. I‚Äôm at my wits end here I love this girl more than heroin for sure and want to be clean truly I just am afraid of getting caught because of withdrawal. Is there anything besides subs or other opiated maintenance drugs that‚Äôs I can source otc that would make this more bearable?  I can‚Äôt lose her for trying to get clean but I also will lose her if I continue to use as the signs are starting to become obvious no sex drive or appetite etc. please help fam I really can‚Äôt lose this girl she‚Äôs my everything, and I can‚Äôt keep using to cope since it clearly won‚Äôt do anything to bring my boy back.

Jails, planes, family functions...etc. I have a few. One of which sticks out though. I played hockey for my college when I very first started using. Back then it was pills but my habit got pretty high and at this time I was sniffing 6-8 oxy 30‚Äôs a day. How I managed to play hockey high on oxy‚Äôs (and actually play fairly well considering how banged up i always was) is another story in it of itself but anyhow...My team made it to nationals which was in Colorado. I‚Äôm located on the east coast, so this was about a 4-5 hour flight give or take. Me and another kid on the team who also was addicted went and bought a shit ton of 30s to hopefully portion out through the trip. But as most of you probably know where this story is heading, that didn‚Äôt happen. So here‚Äôs the scene... I ran out about two days before we left. Played our last game in minor w/d. Had to do team lunches and also my dad had flown out to see me play so i was with him. It was brutal. But nothing compared to the 2nd day. The 2nd day was our travel day back to the east coast. Before our flight which was at night we did a team excursion to a nearby ski village just to check it out and eat dinner. I was in full blown day 2 w/d. It was horrible. The plane ride was even worse. We got delayed on the tarmac for 2 hours. I had middle seat next to a screaming toddler and another lady who definitely should‚Äôve been forced to buy 2 seats. Flight all together took us about 6 hours to get back. Me and the kid who I bought the pills with were both withdrawing horribly. I got the RL, sweats, stomach bile puke, and anxiety the entire time. We got well as soon as we got back but man I‚Äôll never forget that trip. That was one of the worst wd experiences I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôm sure it doesn‚Äôt compare to jails and stuff but still. It was a nightmare. Especially because my dad was there and he could tell something was up. Brutal. Don‚Äôt miss those days lol",1514266959.0

This is not my usual account, but I needed the advice of my people without certain other people knowing it‚Äôs me asking for said advice. Any way. I hope you all had a great Christmas/‚Äúinsert holiday of choice here‚Äù. 
On to the point of the post!
So I suck at making friends, let alone friends who enjoy opiates like I do. I met this person in the land of the online. We started chatting, a joke here, some flirtatious emojis there. Then, upon discovering that this person and myself live very closely, we decided to exchange numbers and get to know one another via text/phone calls. After a few months of chatting/getting to know one another, we decide to meet up and share our ‚Äúloot‚Äù or sample platter, if you will, of what we each get from our own prospective areas. Any way...long story even longer we kind of hit it off. We start hanging out when we got the chance, even if it was just a short lunch break. I have really come to like this person and I‚Äôm sure the feeling is very much mutual as this person has told me as much. Such as, they enjoy my company and want to see where things go. 
My question to you all is this: Would you get into a relationship with 
someone who was into opiates/other drugs like yourself? Even if you knew you both had good paying jobs that you were dedicated to, both of you had your own living quarters and forms of transportation etc. etc. 
Would you date another opiate enthusiast? 
Why or why not? 
Do you think it would last or end in disaster? 

Thanks for your feedback!

My family and I got into a pretty big fight (not about my drug use), and it pretty much blew everything out of proportion and ruined our day. Well it ruined my day. 

I'm just trying to savor those moments I get to spend with my grandmother. It's not often that she calls me by my own name anymore. Days like today when she does, I could sit by her side all day and talk to her and look at her and just listen to her say my name. My grandma is the only person who never lost faith in me no matter how bad things got for me. I truly don't know what I'm ever going to do without her... Or what I'm going to do when she doesn't say my name at all anymore. Right now at least she calls me her daughter's name, my aunt, she calls me my Aunt sometimes. I know soon she won't know me is anybody at all, but today she got to be home. She got to be at my aunt's house. I don't believe in anything religious really, but it really did seem like a miracle that she knew who everyone was today. Christmas has always been mine and my grandmother's favorite time. I'm afraid this may be the last year she'll remember it with me.

I'm trying to pretend this fight didn't happen. I'm trying to pretend everything is okay and that this couldn't ruin Christmas. I saw the disappointment in her face when my father and I left still arguing. I hate that I left that way, I hate that I left with that for her to see. I'll see her again. I'll see her hopefully the day after tomorrow again and I know I won't have to end things bad, not with her ever. I just feel bad because we had such a great day and ended on such a bad note. 

I will miss these days with my grandmother so much. All I had was a point to snort and a little Opana so I took everything I had and I just want to go to bed. I'm not high anyway. I could probably use some Xanax but really I just want to get high as fuck and I wish I had more drugs, shocking.

I really hope some of you had as great of a day with your family as I did with mine. It didn't end okay, but the time I spent with my grandma today was more important to me that I can describe and I hope that you all had something wonderful like that happened for you today, too.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7m40lc/when_you_have_money_and_nobody_will_answer_the/
This thread was my swan song I thought then my usual connect, who is pretty reliable, says he's eating dinner but has to go cop, himself, afterward and to meet him at his place around 6:45.

I show up at 6:45, his girl who is getting them is there, i give her $70 for 2 blue @ $35 each plus $10 for gas or coke or whatever winds her up and they all pile in the car and go for what I think is a 20 min drive there and 20 back, plus 10 or 15 niceties.

**5 fucking hours** I wait, in severe WD at someone elses house watching fucking Law and Order SVU over and over, all the while getting vague fucking updates like ""dude light. going to hardees now"" like that means *anything* to me. 

Turns out he doesn't have enough, has to drive 40 mins to someone elses house to *see* if they have more (oh yeah did I mention the first guys place wasn't 20 mins away but 45?!?).

So at this poing I'm like fuck it in the butt. I'm over it. But wait. THEY have my money. After 5 hours they say he can't get any more and come home at 11:30. 

Turns out they didn't quite end up with nothing, but just had to tow that particular line because of some other dude in the car. The down side is they only had 1 for me and only $30 of my original $80.

So, TL;DR: I waited 5 hours to pay $50 for one blue tonight.

I don't know if I'm happy that I got a blue or sad and pissed that I got shafted....I honestly don't know.

*Clarification Update* - The ppl that went running for me are friends I've known for years. Now, any junkie, (pill or skag,) is subject to shady behavior and the fact that they came back with just enough to give me one, but not two means I was lower on the totem pole than everyone else. In fairness, if you don't go on the ride to the connect, you're automagically lower on the pecking order than the ones in the car, at 30 degress, in winter, waiting in a Hardee's parking lot. I get that. So the more I thought about it the more I felt slighted but gave up, willingly $10 extra to the girl doing the running that wasn't getting anything for herself. That's a shitty ticket to pull - driving and waiting 5 hours to not get anything. I expected to pay $35 for the pill so I really paid $40 for the pill which is still high plus the $10 for my piece of mind.

Still, it comes to the same. 5 hours and $50 later all I got was one blue.

In contrast, I just picked up 7.5 percs (5 of them) for $7 each (still high but less than $1/mg) and feel 1000% better than I did last night after that blue.

And why that matters.","In the 'grand scheme' of things no one 'matters,' so really the only people we make a difference to/matter to are our friends and family. If that makes sense.

We should all think about how our actions effect those closest to us, even not thinking about how our potential suicide would effect them.

We should always try to be the best version of ourselves we can, especially to younger family members because, we may not think anyone could be so stupid, but they probably look up to us.

Our parents only want the best for us, it's why they pry when we think they shouldn't.  So much of who they are is wrapped up in who we are and who we will become.

In my experience, siblings are petty and vindictive and only want to find dirt on you so they can talk about you behind your back.  So we should be better than we are, just to spite them.

Our children are who we really need to be better for.  Sure, we can say 'at least we can be a cautionary tale for them.'  But in the end they are going to pick up traits from us, either through nature or nurture, so we shouldn't stack the deck against them.  Be a good example for them.  Suicide, even attempted, will fuck them up in ways we cannot even begin to understand...

We should always strive to better ourselves.  It not only makes us feel better about ourselves, but it makes the people that matter to us, and the ones we matter to, feel better about us.

Even if we don't plan on stopping our use of drugs, we can strive to be better than we currently are.  We can stop stealing from those we care about.  We can stop lying to them.  We can try to keep a job, even if it's just a shitty part-time job.  We can learn something new, or go to college.  If we can do some of those things, it can make everyone around us, ourselves included, feel better.  And when we feel better, it can make it easier to clean ourselves up if we ever choose to.

I wish i went tho i wouldnt leave because i was concerned about him but as i was walking to my room past the bathroom i heard a strange gurgling sound like he was trying to drown himself in the sink i immediately started pounding on the door but it was locked so i ran to my room snatched a bobby oin off the floor and started frantically bending it and trying to bite those little rubber tips off to picklock the bathroom door when i did i was horrified and my mind just went blank i will never in my life forget this for as long as i live there was blood everywhere on the walls the floor the mirrors the toilet the sink the tub he was standing infront of the toilet with the biggest kitchen knife we had just slicing both sides of his neck with such great force the sound the knife made cutting the tissue muscle and veins still makes me cringe typing this but all i could say was ""Dad No!"" I ran up to him and tried to take the knofe away from him but he yanked it back and just said to me no i need to do this at that point i already knew even if there were EMTs in that room he would still be dead he had made about 5-6 deep cuts on each aide of his neck so i just took a step back in shock and watched my dad just stand there slicing and slicing away i knew my time with him was running out by the second so i just looked at him through the mirror and said "" i love you dad"" he just looked me with the most regretful face ever and said ""i love you too Brandon"" and not evem 2 minutes later he had collapsed on the bathroom floor while i was just watching i was in so much shock i contenplated if i was going to wake up because this just had to be a dream it was too fucked up for it to be real life i called my mom and she called the police (i know some of you are gonna bitch me out for not caling the cops right away but i was only 17 in complete shock and had no idea what the fuck to do) after that moment i felt that my life couldnt get any worse because the worst possible thing that could have happened did happen.... I dont know guys i dont know yall but you guys seem like really nice people i just wanted to share this story and all i ask of you all is just please enjoy your families they are here for a limited time and drugs will always be here its really hard spending another christmas without him and i just fucking miss him so much im not mad at him at all i just feel so sorry for the poor man that he was in that much pain he felt he gad to do that he was my bestfriend we always use to smoke a little weed and pop a couple of hydros together and listen to classic rock on the radio i really do miss those days amd i would do anything to get them back...

Anyway, I recently (like a few months ago) made the switch to H because the pill game in my area has gone to shit. I met my plug through a friend who's been buying from this guy for a long time and he's a super chill guy. He's honestly the best plug I've ever had as far as reliability and timing and such. And he's fronted me a couple times when I needed it which was cool since I was a new customer and all. Price in my area is $100/bun but he's been really good about giving me a deal if I buy 5 at a time. The last couple times he's given me 5 buns for $325 and 5 buns lasts me and my girl the whole week (only enough to get actually high a couple times and then just staying good the rest of the week). I really appreciate the pricing break he gives me but the last couple of times I feel like the product has been subpar and the bags have been really light. Last week I actually got one completely empty bag and 2 others that doesn't have enough in them to make 1 full bag. And this week the bags were light and weak af. I'm not really sure if I should say anything or not because he's my only connect and I don't want to piss him off yea know? I also don't want him to take it the wrong way and start charging me full price for 5 buns because I can't really afford what I'm spending now let alone another $150- $175 ya know? And I'm pretty sure he's not the one breaking this stuff down and bagging it either because he has re-upped and sold to me within an hour or 2. All that being said, at what point do I mention that the product he has is weak or that I'm getting empty/super light bags?

He was my only male cousin in the family, and we were only 3 months apart. It‚Äôs been weighing on my mind heavy but I still don‚Äôt think reality has set in that I‚Äôll never be able to see or speak to him again. I‚Äôve been clean for close to 2 years off heroin myself,  and that just makes this whole situation so much worse due to knowing the lifestyle and struggles that follow it. my cousin and I never talked about opiates or using, just about smoking trees and such, so I literally had no idea he was even going through something of this caliber. My uncle says over past 3 months he gained a bunch of healthy weight and even gave up smoking cigarettes & pot (which leads me to believe he actually was quitting or working towards becoming sober at very least, makes it even more sad).

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the OD took place in Prince George‚Äôs County MD.

The stories on here are incredibly moving, many posts extremely informative, helpful or funny. But one thing I've noticed is that most if not all users have a mostly negative relationship with opiates. I can certainly understand that and I have felt some, but very few of those negative effects. I was prescribed oxycodone for anxiety and after using it daily for a few months, I missed it very much when I moved to the US. For a few days I was really depressed, but I managed pretty easy with subutex, and just jumped off my last dose of that. I don't think opiates for anxiety are the right thing for me anymore. at least, not used more than max once a week for important occasions. I do think in certain people it can be a great option, though. Anyway, as the title of this post implies, what I'm looking for are your opinions on responsible opioid use. Do you believe it can be done? In your opinion, can people use opioids regularly, but responsibly like others use alcohol? I am convinced of it. While I'm not even sure if I personally can sustain such a pattern of use, I know that there are many people, most even, that never have any problems with drugs. On this sub most of the time however it seems like the general consensus is anyone who is using opioids is using them compulsively. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. ",1514248986.0

Edit: thanks for the replies. I'll find out tomorrow when I get called in to have a chat after I dose. That's at least what I'm expecting. And stop going down my dose or go up for a couple of weeks. I don't think I'll ever be free of substances at this point. I just have to keep things together. I'm thinking about getting a medical Marijuana card. Perhaps this alternative can get me off opiates for a minute. Weed has lost its magic ever since I got good into opiates.

We were down to the last few bags and this girl doesnt shoot h. in fact she never did it. she  likes shooting coke so we had the stuff out in two separate piles on the opposite side of the table. I mix my shot n set her up with hers. 


I go to the bathroom real quick and when I come back she hands me her shot and asks me to bot her up. I was barred out on like 4-6mg I was eating all day. so I wasn't like really looking att the shot and hit her.. 

Next thing I know she is like ""Whoa that is good. I feel really warm."" Then was like""I don't feel well."" her face turned completely motionless and expressionless. I immedaialty realized she took my shot. (I shooot 5-8 bags at a time). I FREAK out and she starts to like collapse (more like slowly laying down) so I throw her on the couch and her face turns blue. Shallow breathing..light pulse and not responding. I do a chest rub nothing. now her lips are blue so I tilt her head back n give severe rescue breaths. nothing. few chest compressions, slapping her face nothin.g I I openher mouth n her tongue is like curled back and blue. all of a sudden she starts seizing n gurgling. (this is like over 3 minute period). to top it all off I lost my phone earlier that night so I am panicked. I find her phone n remember if u hit the side button 5 times it puts it into SOS method.

I call 911 report the OD and they instruct me put her side and wait. At this point  toss all the needles, baggies, wipe the counter, and am like praying she is okay. Finally dispatch says they are downstairs- this is a luxury building in NYC but no doorman. So I run downstairs and fucking NYPD, EMS, and FDNY are there (8-9 people). I rush them upstairs and they pull me aside (NYPD.). 

I am watching them put an airmask on her and someone say (I think were going to have  a DOA). the NYPD really get intense and start asking me tons of questions, where she get it..howd she do it..ext. I say idk its heroin and she's odin that is lal that matters. They hit her with narcan,nothing.  I cant tell for sure how they did it but they hit her with narcan again..I want to say IV/IM administration. she pukes and wakes up. They tell me she was about a min from not coming back. she had 30% oxygen level and if she died I was getting charged with murder. 

I go with her to the hospital and they want to run all these bs tests. at this point she is fine. Now normally id say of course run the tests - they wanted to do a CAT scan and all this crap but she's uninsured son  was ike your going get like a 30k bill. it's your call. I wouldn't do it - she agreed. She lives only 5 blocks from the hospital. they gave us two narcan kits and we decided id stay with her and if anything changes we'd come back. mind you she also had a flight home in 4 hours.

Long story short she is fine but done with drugs. then she asked me to be her boyfriend after this was all done haa. she's a good girl and knows all about me soo I guess we are dating. plus she's rich.

OHHH and when the cops left her place they fucked up her bolt looks and we had to call a locksmith who charged 320 bucks to fix the door (the like door hinge broke). Girl is fucking loaded. she gave me her card to get cash and there was 21k in the account. 

also like I said I was barred out I came home and my room looked ransacked. I think I threw out all my clothes n checked pockets for lost bags. 

what a shitty christmas but Im just happy she is okay and that is aol that matters",1514243047.0

Well today I picked up from the guy who sold me that same stuff cause my regular guy was busy since it‚Äôs Christmas. 

Well I shot up in the same spot I always do and immediately felt a burning sensation I kept shooting it and once finished my thumb and index plus middle finger swelled up. I shot in my wrist again but I use the same spot all the time and it‚Äôs never happened with my regular dudes dope. 

Is it the dope or is it that I missed and shot in an artery? 

Also the tourniquet wasn‚Äôt on so it couldn‚Äôt have been that. 

Edit 1: id appreciate any help or advice. Thanks. 
I used to go through the guy who sold me that stuff a lot before but I stopped and go through my regular guy now. 
The dope when mixed with water looked like dirty water kinda. 

Edit 2: I just did another shot of backup dboys stuff in my hand and it immediately started itching and turned red like if I had a rash. I only did half the shot then finished the other half in my foot with no problem and no itching. 

I have one shot left in the morning for when I‚Äôm sick so hopefully it helps and tomorrow I‚Äôll be picking up through my regular guy. ",1514232889.0

I sit here now with a sub under my tounge, in a nice warm house, I have a good welding career.. hell I'm getting paid to just sit around for the next two days.. but it wasn't always like that.  Just a few years back you would have found me out on the streets, pan-handeling, looking for anyone who felt sorry enough for me.  I used to get excited about Christmas and the week or so before it.  When it comes to pan-handeling, you cant beat it, people hand out exxxtra nice once it gets close to Christmas, especially if your smart enough to hang out by a huge shopping center or mall.  Not only do the crowds help.. but all the spending gets people feeling extra guilty and generous.  So anyways... probably about three years ago I was living in a squat on the north east side of town.  It wasn't proper as I didn't have it locked up or anything and just about everyone in the city had access to it, not to mention it was a burnout so it was gross as hell and depressing as could be.  However it was off the beatin path and wasn't so popular, people for the most part found some where to fix long before the came across this spot.  There where some nights where no one else would show-up at all and even though there were a few other regulars staying, for this part of town that is hard to come by. Any privacy at all is hard earned when your on the streets and it definitely is not something to pass up! believe it or not  people here wait in the bush's under the bridges along the tracks that run through the area, they wait while your prepping your shot and just as your ready to fix they jump out on you and hold you up for it! I even had a friend who says he had already drawn back blood when they snuck up on him, ripping it out of his arm before he could push the plunger down,  its never happened to me but I've heard the stories ;).  Well as I was saying, this particular house was a lot more quiet and this Christmas eve was no different it was early in the evening but I was already inside,  I knew there was a lot more money to be made but I was tired, I didn't want to be out.  I sat on my sleeping bag that I had sprawled out on the second floor right next to the window, I had been watching this younger kid hobble around outside for about 5 min. now, as he made it to my house i knew he was coming in.  I sighed as i heard the front door open, really I just wanted to be alone.  The kid called out to ask if anyone was here and I answered ""on the second floor"" at least he had some courtesy I thought.  I listened to him make his way to my room and as I stood in the door way i could instantly feel his wanting of something.  Had he just been trying to fix he would have done it as quick as possible and left.  Before he could even ask me anything I muttered a low grumbly ""what?"". he proceeded to tell me how his veins were horrible, the cold had made them worse and had just wasted 2 bags trying to hit his neck, he had to panhandle again still half sick so that he could get two more and he had been hobeling outside trying to find someone to hit him in the neck when he saw the house and thought of checking it for a person skilled in the trade of iv drugs.  While this is literally something I don't do EVER, the reason being a whole other story,  I literally thought to myself ""its Christmas I guess"" and made the decision to help the kid out.  As he fixed up his shot, a problem occured that I had not considered before that, I was obviously now craving one myself.  No way my own bags, exactly enough for one fat Christmas morning speedball, would survive the night in my pocket till morning.  As I pulled back the blood and registered in his neck the fuck-it's had already completely washed over me, i fixed the last of my shit immediately after and instantly my relaxing Christmas eve. was no more.  I ended up spending all night pan-handeling as I did not get to a good spot until 9pm and it was Christmas eve.  Once I had got 25 bucks together for another speedball it was almost midnight and by the time i made it back north it was 30 after.  The kid had tagged along with me and as we both walked around the badlands that night looking for dope and coke on Chritsmas eve, I somehow felt better.  My mood was lifted, it felt good just being out in the snow doing my favorite thing with someone else.  I definitely felt better than i did sitting all alone in that squat.  There where plenty of corners out that eve but alot of the good ones, as usual late at night, where inside.  In the end we copped a stamp called 7 up, ok shit but def. not the best at the time.  If your wondering did we get a Christmas discount? the answer is no but that night is forever frozen in time for me and every Christmas i think about it ...every Christmas I think maybe just one more .. BUT .. I have not found the need to do so .. YET.  even though I can feel it getting closer and closer I'm just gonna keep holding on.

I want to keep my Morales in one piece. Ill steal from a store, but never a person. 
Well, long story short, my grandmother is a bitch. She has been mean and hateful to me my entire life,always trying to make sure she pits my mom and I against one another.  and she has been more, and more manipulative and decieteful in her attempts the older I've gotten. I mean this bitch knows NO boundaries at all, none. And I have honestly never done anything to warrant the way she treats me. 
So I was living in a trailer my mom owned until my grandmother called the owner of the trailer park, and urged them to evict me, claiming my mom couldn't bring herself to evict her child. Well it worked, but backfired when my mom let me move into the house she shares with the bitch, until I got on my feet. (I wasn't paying any rent before I was evicted, so taking on a full rent payment, or house payment wasn't something I was planning on). 
So now my grandmother has resorted to straight up psychotic shit. Claiming I pushed her down, I did not touch the bitch. 
So this morning the bitch tried to say that I stole my mother's Christmas present from her. A fucking bottle of perfume. I don't even wear fucking perfume, it gives me horrible migraines. 
Yet my mother believes every single psycho lie that comes out of her mouth, no matter how ridiculous it is. 
I'm seriously to my breaking point. It must be exhausting to be as hateful as she is, and it must be really tiring to maintain so many different personalities in the same skull.
(Side note, I literally saved her worthless life, literally)
I don't know wtf to do. In pretty resigned to the fact that my kids are my only family left.

He recently told me that he wants to split because he feels like he shouldn‚Äôt be apart of anyone‚Äôs life with cravings for heroin and other drugs. He feels like he is selfish and needs to get himself together before we continue a relationship/ starting a family. I completely agree with this but he doesn‚Äôt have a major issue with drugs and I am willing to ‚Äúfight‚Äù the demons with him. I know it‚Äôs something I can‚Äôt control or help him with but I truly feel like he shouldn‚Äôt be alone and he‚Äôs asking for space. I trust him completely on wanting to grow alone but I‚Äôm worried he‚Äôll find himself in the dark hole he‚Äôs been in and won‚Äôt be able to get out. His father passed away 3 years ago around this time of year and he gets really apathetic towards everything and everyone around the winter holidays. He always says he always wanted to be the father he had growing up because that‚Äôs the person who meant the most to him and I believe him completely. So I think having this baby will make him let go of the minor cravings he has for heroin. 

Am I an idiot for thinking this? 

He does cocaine socially and smokes weed often but heroin was never on the agenda. He tried it two years ago and enjoyed it but he never let himself go down a really ugly path with it. The times he has tried it have all been during the winter holidays when his dad passed(assuming he‚Äôs using it as a coping method). 

Should I keep the baby and be optimistic or should I abort the baby and give him the space that he wants?

I‚Äôm honestly not sure what to do... 

My fear isn‚Äôt being a single mother, my fear is having to potentially deal with a dead partner and blaming myself for depriving him of what potentially could have saved his life..

Please give advice. I am financially stable and so is he. We both have good jobs so just keep that in mind when commenting, thanks.

UPDATE:

I decided to abort the baby at nearly 15 weeks pregnant. I am going to give my partner his space and respect his decision to want to figure out how to balance and fill the void of drug use.

When you realize/find out you've been keeping your ""friends"" well but they've been actually getting high without you.  
Short rant, but for approx. two weeks now I've been keeping my friend well just to find out after we hangout he's been picking up afterwards. I found out today when I went to grab my phone charger and he was driving. He took the standard route to the dboys house and I backed off for a bit and took an alternate route. I parked about a block down from the dboys and he was there.  
Do y'all think I should call him out on it or wait for tomorrow to come around and play sick too see if he would help me get well?

I've been using kratom for like two years now and I used to not fiend for kratom but since I've gotten off opiates now I do. Every time the effects dissipate I feel like I'm in a mini W/D. Not as strong as real W/D's, but still uncomfortable and something not fun to deal with. 

I don't know. I feel worse than when I was using opiates. At least when I was doing opiates I had a guaranteed relief and relaxation. Sometimes kratom works sometimes it doesn't. I just don't feel any better at all. I know it's only been a month and these things take time, but holy fuck. I feel like absolutely no progress has been made. I've had chances to buy dope or use morphine but I've turned them down even though I want to get high every day.

Slightly curious..","So, me and my girl have been using Heroin for about 18 months (daily use). It got to the point, as it almost always does, of wanting to get off it. Having done this before and obviously failed, we decided to try a different route than last time, which was weaning off using Methadone (120mgs first day and 10mg less every day for two weeks).

This failed as the cravings got too bad and the heroin was just too accessible to us. However, this time around, we are actually going about it in a proper manner. We successfully scored some french Bupe from the streets and began a taper, we're down from 8mgs/day to 2mgs/day nine days later. 

During Xmas I took her with me to my family in Stockholm and found some Targin laying about. Having never seen this medication before, but seeing oxycodone listed as the main ingriedient, I was intrigued, however upon further inspection, I discovered the pills actually contain Naloxone also. The person in need of the pain medication has no need for it any more and told me to bring it back home with me if I would like to. So I did. 

Being a pharma-interested guy my whole life, I know a thing or two about the affinity of Bupe, how it interacts with the Naloxone in Suboxone, and how the Naloxone effect differs with regard to ROA.
Having been off Heroin for about ten days, only on bupe and the occasional Xanax and Tramadol to lessen the WDs at family functions during Xmas etc. I was wondering how the Naloxone would effect us.

 My personal guess would be that taking ten or fifteen Targin tablets orally, probably wouldn't induce PWD, but shooting them would. My other thought is that the bupe currently in our system (we insufflated the last of our remaining stash about ten minutes ago) would block the effects of the oxycodone regardless of the other stuff. But I was thinking, now whilst going through my phone and deleting all my dope-dealers telephone numbers, if I maybe should buy some more Bupe and taper a while longer to lessen the temptation for relapse after such a quick taper. But then I remembered the Targin.. Is it possible to wait for the Bupe WDs to come, and then dose the Targin for some relief? Or is there enough bupe still attached to our receptors for the Naloxone to send us into an even deeper WD until it wears off and the Oxycodone hits? 

Basically, my question is: What would happen, if:
1: Insufflated the targin when the Bupe WDs are present but mild
2: Take them orally now (on Bupe)
3: Insufflate them now (on Bupe)
4: Wait until after the other opiates are out of our system and then take them in any number of ways

Sorry if I am abit all over the place or am writing confusing. I haven't actually typed anything on a keyboard for a long time and I'm also on some Alprazolam, and it's 6:16am where I'm at and sleep is something WDs just doesn't let me have.

For the unaware, it's a show where they seemingly investigate all aspects of any kind of drug game you care to mention through a variety of hidden cameras as well as more traditional investigative television. However, I'm skeptical about some of the actors and the integrity of the producers.

They seem to get a lot of shit right, but there are some subtle tells. I have a sneaking suspicious that it might be something along the lines of 50/50 real/fake.

Regardless, I've seen a bunch of it, and some of the the shit that goes down can be kind of funny and ridiculous. The one on Staten Island had some funny shit with these cops trying to cold call dealers, and if they weren't cops, they were definitely clueless actors who helped add some spot on, ytypical ""cops who just don't get it"" kind of vibe.

They had this ""cop"" calling random dealers going ""Hey yo, it's Steve, you around or not? I need 8.""

8 what? And just little shit like his tone, and the way he said ""You around *or not*?"" For whatever reason that little bit at the end right there would clue me in to it being a cop. Call it ""junkie intuition"" or whatever, but I think nearly any custie is kind of hyper aware of the wording of their initial pitch, and sort of naturally avoids negative language like that. It's simply ""you around?"" or ""trying to see if you're around,"" or some variation of that. His tone didn't help at all and he kept being like ""yeah, remember me, with the pick up truck?"" It tends not to matter. Any dealer with half a brain won't serve to someone who hasn't been vouched for. But this dudes voice was literally the vocal equivalent of the ""cop knock."" IIRC, they nab the guy for some dumb shit, like a bundle or maybe like 7 bags. 

Another pretty funny bit was this dude going ""yeah, this is my 40 Glock! It's on!"" and his burner was this garbage little no name 40 that looked like an airsoft gun he bought from a corner store or some shit.

Anyway kind of a decent show, figured it might be fun to discuss it or talk shit about it. ",1514344197.0

She's a raging alcoholic and everyone knows it.  If she doesn't have a drink every so many hours she gets the shakes, etc.

Well this time they didn't rent a car, so they have to borrow my mom's car if they want to go anywhere.  My mom doesn't allow alcohol in the house, so if my sister wants to drink she has to leave.  Using someone else's car (my mom's) and then come home drunk.

She's done this twice so far.  The first time my mom knew and was livid.  She flipped her lid, so to speak.  The second time my dad tried to hide it from my mom, partly because he's in denial about my sister's problem and partly because he thinks drinking is okay.

Well, today it just happened again.  She said she was going running, but even her husband knew what she was going to do.  He even told her she shouldn't go 'running' with air quotes.  My dad helped her find the keys...

This pissed me the fuck off because everytime I leave my house for more than 30 minutes I get back to back phone calls from my dad accusing me of going to buy drugs (they live next door).  Even if I'm broke or I have my daughter with me.  If I try to explain what I'm doing, after being asked where I am and what I'm doing, I get called a liar.

So I straight up told my dad I didn't appreciate the double standard.  Dad said, ""She said she was going running."". And I said, ""When I do that, I'm just called a liar.  That's a double standard."". Then I left cause evidently the conversation had ending, if his lack of speaking was any indication.

Any advice?,"So yeah I‚Äôm pretty much at the end of another run. Broke, defeated, starting to get sick; but this time something‚Äôs different. Instead of wanting to scheme up a way to get cash or score money, I want to just get over the fucking sickness and get my life back together. 

I was taking kratom for a few years straight (anywhere from 5-6 grams, 3-4 times a days) and I ended up getting my friend‚Äôs brother‚Äôs connect. He sells just about everything so I just started picking up addies and he would always show me his dope and ask me if I wanted any. I avoided that for like 2-3 months and then I gave in and decided to try a 20 bag at the beginning of summer. I got super high and then went back to my usual kratom and occasional pills. This was at the beginning of summer like 7-8 months ago. 

I, of course, gradually picked it up more and more. At first I‚Äôd wait like 2 weeks between and then eventually... well I think you guys get the picture. And of course I‚Äôve become someone that does things I never imagined myself doing. I haven‚Äôt gone nearly as far as it can go and I know it can always get worse. Thankfully haven‚Äôt resorted to crime or stealing from family or friends, but now I‚Äôm actually starting to have thoughts about that and I hate it.

So here I am, off my subs for a couple months (I was on them for 3 months until I cracked) and getting off a binge of 2 months or so.

I always snort my dope and it may not sound bad for only 2 months, but before that I was taking 16mg of subs a day, and before that Oxy, Vicodin, and kratom. This also isn‚Äôt my first dope binge, just the first since I‚Äôve been on (and now off) the subs.

Basically, I‚Äôve been taking some form of opiate for nearly 4 years or more. I‚Äôm super scared of the withdrawals.

I did my last little bit of dope way earlier and decided to go to my little cousin‚Äôs house to get away from my house as I start to get sick. I‚Äôm a 23 year old male and he‚Äôs a 16 year old teen playing games right now and probably wondering why I‚Äôm acting the way I am.

I have some kratom and just bought Imodium hoping it will help. When I get back home I have 900mg gabapentin which I heard is decently helpful when used properly.

Bad or good idea to go away to my cousin‚Äôs as I‚Äôm starting to get sick??

I want it this time. I really do. I‚Äôm sick of being a fuck-up and disappointing myself and my parents / sister who have done sooo much to put me ahead in life.

I‚Äôve also never tried the Imodium before but I know to be safe with the huge dosing. I know it can help if used with some caution.

Any advice?",1514332994.0
7mbcdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mbcdf/harm_reduction_tips_and_tricks/,8,https://redd.it/7mbcdf,dopefiction312,Harm Reduction Tips and Tricks,"Hey opifriends. I post a lot of dope porn and brag a bit but wanted to start a talk focusing on the other side of what makes this sub so great: Harm Reduction. 

When I first started using and especially IV this place was a life saver due it's endless stories and tips from veterans who give real life answers and less rhetoric than your average harm reduction source. Any one want to share a tip they have learned a long the way that has helped reduce harm, pain and hospital visits? I'll start: 

When i was began IVing I always wanted to see how quickly I could complete the ritual. Taking pride that I could get a shot in under less than 2 minutes. I also found myself with lots of a abscesses and ify swollen hands or arms that could have been anything from a histamine reaction to MRSA and I never honestly knew. I blame a lot of this on my impatience to confirm I had a good clean register. I pretty much took any flash of blood as a sign that I was in and would plunge away telling myself some shots just hurt more than others. Lord was I wrong. 

Since then I've realized how much harm it did on my body and veins but how much dope I wasted and how many great buzzes I didn't get to experience. If you're not 100% sure that you have a register (dark blood shooting up through the middle of the barrel not just slowly creeping up the sides) than don't take the shot and try again. I know this can be frustrating and seemingly time consuming but it's always worth the extra 5 minutes to find a good vein than it is to sit in a hospital or not enjoy your shot because you're nervous you done goofed. 

Getting a false register has also inadvertently put me in a position where I nearly ODed because I had a false sense of how strong the dope was. I would shoot a point, miss most of it and think ok this stuff is mild I can def handle 2 points. Load it up, get a real register the next time and get blown back because it wasn't as weak as I thought it was. This can be a pretty scary experience because you feel like you're going in with good info and that confidence distracts you from being critical and using proper caution the next time around. 

Learn and know the signs of a proper register and what a register from an artery looks like and save yourself heaps of pain and discomfort and trade it in for an awesome rush and since of confidence that you did things the right way. This will make the high just that much better. 

Anywho! That's my one small tip you won't really find in the medical books that I learned along the way. Would anyone else like to contribute?",1514332488.0

Wowee golly gosh and golly gee. I think I have good news.","Don't know if anyone remembers, but I was arrested in late October and it was absolute overkill. I made a post detailing the situation but only kept it up for 24 hours because it's a very specific incident and I couldn't put my identity at risk. Basically in late October of this year I was arrested and held in police custody during this 8 hour excursion that simply shouldn't have happened. I generally take full responsibility of my actions and don't play victim, but this was horse ass. 10 cops, 2 K9 units and the FBI later I have serious felonies hanging over my head on a very prestigious federal site. 

I talked to 2 private attorneys in person, and both of them told me I'll likely get some prison time and that my case is such a shit show that they, as attorneys, want nothing to do with it, but will be hired if I really want them. Discouragement at it's finest.

If you haven't received a court date in 45 days you're supposed to call this number on the back of your tickets that show your charges. It's been around 60 days now, so I called today. 

The arresting officer never put my case in for filing. 

So does this mean I dodged a bullet, need to learn a lesson and continue on my merry way as a confused but trying degenerate? Or does it just mean I still have to go to prison? The arresting officer didn't know what the fuck he was doing and needed step by step instructions from several people around to go through the process of an arrest.

I have been using BTH since April of this year. I snorted all the way up until a couple weeks ago then made the switch to IV. I had a previous BTH addiction 8 years ago but had always used some sort of opiate here and there. I don't know why but that feeling I get when using makes me feel whole. This time is different though. I have a wife of 4 years and 2 children under 3. They are the light of my life. Everything has come to the surface about my addiction and I had not used since Thursday of last week. I used small amounts of Subs and some Kratom to help with RLS(which is the worst) and the W/D was not all that terrible compared to what I experienced 8 years ago. Today I woke up with a little RLS but not terrible. But the overall feeling of anxiety, fear, and depression every morning is overwhelming. I drank some Kratom but no subs and felt decent. On my way to work I was looking for a lighter and found a rig. I thought I had thrown them all out... apparently not.....Long story cut short finding that through me for a loop and I ended up relapsing today. I do not want to use any more. I have a great career a wonderful family but if I continue to live this life I will lose it all. I have put my wife through so much and it hurts to see the pain I have caused. My son is 3 yrs old and is starting to pick up on things and I do not want him to go through this. I guess my question is whats next. Will I go back through the rough withdraws all over again just from this one relapse? I am done with this shit. I know the feelings I am experiencing (anxiety, overwhelming fear, and depression) are fake and are caused by my drug use. Any suggestions or hopeful stories that can shift my focus and help me understand this is not permanent and it does get better. I will recover if I want to. Which I do more than anything.

My first ever opiate high. It was amazing, best thing I have ever felt. I wasn't expecting much off 10mg as I am 6'2 and 185lbs, but started with that dose in case I was one of those people who are sensitive to opiates, which I now think I am probably am. 

I am happy with that high and am not concerned with chasing a ""nod"". To be honest anything stronger than what I felt (complete full body euphoria and bliss) I would consider overkill. My question is if I wait 4 weeks between every 10mg, will I ever develop a tolerance or need to up the dose?

I ask because some drugs like MDMA, you never really get that first time high back again, even if you wait 5 years before taking it again. Though I believe this has something do with the chemical composition of MDMA and how it is processed in the brain, which I don't think opiates have (I could be wrong).

Yes, I know what you will say ""your once a month plan won't work and you will become a weekly, then eventual daily user and addict"" ... ""everyone thinks they're different but it will happen to you too"". But that aside, lets assume that the four week gap between doses is never broken.

It was a Saturday and I had to be at work at about 5 pm to deliver pizzas. I worked at a hungry howies at the time. Everybody there really liked me so nobody expected it was am OD, ended up passing it off as a woerd episode haha. So I go to my buddies house cuz he said I should come hang out with him and his family by the pool. Well, I get there and he is SCHLOBERED. Tore up from the floor up. ""Oh pig what's up Bro"" falling over himself trying to get out the door. Well he claims he hasn't done anything in 2 weeks (he had been having problems with using to much) and was baffled why everybody was getting upset with him for being so messed up. Next day his uncle.calls me PISSED off because his grandma found all his dope and it was a LOT. turns out he stole some from our dealers bag thinking he wouldn't know and dumped a bunch of cut in it. Well now the uncle didn't know this at the time, and the grandma gave the uncle the dope to get rid of. He decides to sell it. So when he called.me up he says that's why my friend was so,messed up yada yada so says he will sell me what was left for cheap. I oblige and happily travel that direction. Get there, make the deal, got a g for hella cheap. Some of the absolute best shit I have ever had probably ever will. I do some, proceed to hang out with the uncle, feeling good. My time to go to work has come. I drove the 10 miles to my job, and proceed to eat some pizza in the lobby before my shift. Well next thing I know I open my eyes and I'm laying on the dough table in the back with EMTS all around me. I wasn't sure what happened at first. I got them to let me sit up. My ears are ringing. Not the ""somebody is talk g about you"" ringing. I mean it's the ONLY thing I could hear. The medics were screaming in my ear so I could try to follow there instructions and I just kinda laughed and said look I can't hear you, let me stand up. Walked around a bit. Told them I was fine but they forced me to go to the hospital under the threat they would call the cops if I didn't. Okay I guess. Get to hospital and doc finally comes in, I tell him I'm fine and would like to leave. He has no problem left I g me go, even though all the nurses seemed to think I should stay. My grandmother picks me up to take me back to my job so I cam get my car. That's when I realize I don't know what happened with the dope before I passed out. Did I have it in my pocket this whole time? Nope. Start freaking out. What if I dropped it at work. What if an emt got it. I got back and thankfully it was sitting in my console of my car. Greatest feeling of relief. Went in and coworkers were say I g how I was turning blue and not breathing that's when I was like oh shit I just OD'd. They had no clue though. I then went home and dumped all the dope at the bag and just stared at it. I had never had anythi g like it and it really scared me. I then proceeded to be extra careful with it and it lasted me for like another 2 days. Sorry for the long story I'm just here bored so figured I would share.",1514469967.0

This was a comment he received. I found it interesting that we tend to demonize opiates and here this guy talks about them like they are god's gift or something. 

""Hey man I feel you... I really do. I was majorly depressed for a while too. What got me out was opiates. They worked for me better than any meditation technique or therapy or antidepressant. With opiates I can function like a normal person of society. It elevates my mood so I genuinely feel happy while also motivates me to do stuff. Normally I wouldn't recommend it to anyone considering that they can also ruin lives (addiction, OD etc.) but since you decided to kill yourself anyway I figured you should give it a try before you go.

I get it if you are skeptical, but drugs really aren't that bad. They are natural remedies for various ailments, both physical and mental.
When I decided that I will try self-medicating myself I was beyond the edge... I thought, oh well, I want to kill myself, I have nothing in life that I enjoy... Since I have nothing to lose I'll give this a try! And oh, man what a great idea it was. It gives me pleasure in life and relieves me of my depression for the long-therm. I'm currently attending the University of Edinburgh with many ambitions and life-goals. I only got in because with my depression gone I could really flourish in school turning my grades around. Which in turn lead me to feel better about myself. You see, it is a self-propagating thing.

So all in all, I know this probably won't be a favorite advice around these parts but it is my own experience. Weed also worked for me for a while before but it just made me too cloudy and also worsened my motivation which wasn't too good to begin with. On the other hand opiates leave you 100% clear in the mind. No stoning effects. Just an elevated mood, motivation. Euphoria and kindness. It turns you into a better you.

Now the question this all comes down to, is it that bad that you can only live and function with a drug? Would you even ask that question if you were a diabetic needing insulin every 12 hours?

It is still better than being dead. I think that natural drugs are one of the biggest pleasures of earthly existence. Drugs, Food, Sex, Sleep, Achievement, morning dump,  Love. These are all the little pleasures you would give up on by offing yourself.

I tend to think that we depressed people don't really have a disease. We are just people with too big of a heart and maybe too much scar tissue. It would break my heart if you would end it all just because you were never given proper medication. Not the pharmacy shit that Big Pharma pushes. That is just garbage to monetize on. Real medicine lies within nature. Opiates were cultivated even by the early hominids as far back as 40,000 years ago. 

Just because we live in a society where a small elite lie to you and spread anti-drug propaganda for their own financial gain don't you give in!

Personally, I prefer Trolli Sour gummi worms, but to each their own- regardless, I can agree with the consensus that I always find myself craving something sweet & sour when I'm high. I don't find myself going for anything chocolatey, it always has to be sour and gummi. Basically anything sour and gummi is what I crave, and I know that many people agree.

There has to be some sort of scientific reason for this... do opiates make you crave sour candy? Does the sweet and sour sensation affect dopamine or something? I know sugar causes little surges of dopamine (or something? maybe?) and that is why people love it and get addicted to it. Can anyone shed some light on this?

And why is it Sour Patch Kids? IMO, I think there are many sour candies that are better than these, and there are many that don't destroy your mouth if you eat too many. Like I said, Sour Gummi Worms are far superior. But if I'm going for Sour Patch Kids, the cherry ones are fantastic, as well as the peach ones if you can find them. 

I remember years ago when I was in high school (probably over a decade ago- yikes) the Rite Aid by my school used to have these sour caterpillars that were absolute fire. They didn't have a super soft texture, it was almost like they were a little stale. They were fucking perfect. [This](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/e791adc2-c032-4516-b230-71d80bbbabd9_1.ef442328aadbdbbcabbc142e46fc25e1.jpeg?odnHeight=450&odnWidth=450&odnBg=FFFFFF) is what they looked like- they were red or green with the yellow bottoms to them. Haven't found them since high school. Would love to experience them again.

EDIT: Dude in the comments reminded me of my TRUE favorite sour gummi- Haribo Sour Gold Bears. Holy shit, those are pure ecstasy. The consistency of a fresh pack is perfect, and the taste is unparalleled.

I know what I'm asking is super vague and probably impossible to truly guess, but I would appreciate any speculation on anything that could possibly be pressed to look like blue oxycodone A 215's. 

I've bought these specific pills multiple times from the same source, and as far as the pills themselves go they consistent in appearance and effect. They are just almost comically obviously pressed, and they are not fentanyl (unless there is a much weaker analog that I'm not aware of) and they are very obviously not oxycodone. I gave some to a friend a few times and he insisted that they felt and acted just like H, but I've never tried dope so I have no point of comparison. I have had pressed fentanyl sold as oxycodone though, and this is not similar at all. 

I will post the best pictures I could get of them in the comments, and I'm going to offer any information I think might be important. I'm sorry for the length of this post, I'm just obsessed with finding out what these ugly ass presses are. 

They do not seem to have a better oral BA. I find the effects to be much lighter in general when I eat them, very little euphoria, no nod, almost like eating 10mg of hydro. Snorting them gives a nice rush, nothing comparable to fent though, which ends very quickly and causes me to bump all night and then get sad when theyre gone.  

They are extremely soft. There is no coating. Powder starts to come off just from holding them. A whole pill is easily crushed when a card, and the powder is super fine. The edges of the pills are jagged, like they have been crumbling just from being stored, and sometimes the imprint is nearly rubbed off. 

They are a consistent color throughout, no speckling. Sometimes they are a darker or lighter shade of blue though, but it's never too far off. When crushed the powder is still a consistent blue.

The powder is completely flavorless, it's not bitter at all. 

I don't know much about pressed pills, and I really don't know much about opiates. I used to use tramadol a few times a week but other than that I only ever occasionally used hydrocodone. I've done pressed fentanyl a handful of times but that was months ago.  Even though nowadays I use these pills maybe less than once a week, every other week, I think I wouldn't have that great of a tolerance to oxycodone, yet I can snort 3 of these and feel a pretty desirable effect. 

Please, please help me speculate on these weird pills. It's driving me crazy lol.",1514421796.0
7mj4bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mj4bm/whats_up_with_all_the_fentanyl_lately_and_how/,13,https://redd.it/7mj4bm,Homura_Akchemical,What's up with all the fentanyl lately and how much has shit changed? I feel lost.,"So speaking from someone who has a novice habit of only shooting dope since 2011, fentanyl is something that's a bit unknown to me. In my city we get half gram corner bags and you gotta go down to the sketchy-ass BP station to get stamps or hard, and they'll for sure burn you if you don't look in the game or scared about where you are. But we know the city usually only bites back if you provoke it.

 Personally I been going thru the same dude for my entire journey and he's been speaking to me about fentanyl dropping people left and right and about how he keeps his shit clean, and after seeing friends try and go to outside sources and drop the next day it starts hitting home. It's not the same market out there that it was, it used to be dogshit or dog food now it's dog food or instant death. Fucking single stamps are killing people I've known who have used for years.

I know that i'm not trying to buy outside who I know anymore for fear that i'll OD, but I have half a bag of the dope that my friend cold copped and died off of doing 1/4 just in case I feel like shutting it all down someday. I've narcaned 3 friends and been narcaned 4 times this year, the worst of which involved countless kpins and 7 shots of narcan in the busiest intersection in my city and I am only alive thanks to the presence of my friend. I've been to 4 funerals this year for people around my age, slightly older or younger, and i'm only 27. But I still copped today, despite everything logical saying not to. I needed to. I needed my shot of life/death. Fuck anything else until I get that.

I'm sorry this turned into a rant but I have only recently been seeing the major damage that fentanyl has brought to my city and we're for sure not the worst. If you have a dboy that brings you shit you don't OD on, keep buying off him. You get off E, you stay functioning, that's what you need, you go and try another dboy's dope you gonna be the statistic on the news or in the streets that makes everyone flock to that dude's shit. My dude says they're making hot bags that would kill a bitch 20 times over so that their shit gets the word out about its strength. We already have to deal with addiction and a daily struggle to be straight and now there's an added risk of dying instantly mixed in? Not that there never was, but now narcan ain't even bringing you back from it, and the whole game has been spun around.They can't do this shit to hard or shard or nothing else, just the shit we need to function daily, and at this point I almost don't care anymore. But for all those who do, and who really want to keep on going, don't trust that new dboy on the corner. Stay straight don't topple, be easy.",1514421742.0

**Entry 24** - Friday, 2:05 PM

As I prepared to leave, more people began gathering outside my door. They all seem to be in some sort of group psychosis. None are saying anything coherent, just the same heavy breathing and raspy guttural noises. Every once in a while one of them will call out in a sharp scream that sounds like a dying cat. 

I can see at least six pairs of feet under the door just shuffling around in a mess of bloody footprints. Joey‚Äôs arm finally detached itself and is now lying lengthwise on the floor twitching erratically, blocking my view. They keep scratching at the door, but none of them will respond to anything I say. 

My first plan was to bust through the door and go get the staff until I saw one of the nurses‚Äô badges drop to the floor when I was peeking at their feet. So, it appears the staff is mixed up with whatever is going on as well. I really have only one option which is to push my forward my escape plans to right now.

Because my hallway is blocked I‚Äôm going to have to improvise. First step is to take my hammer to the wall between Chloe‚Äôs room and see if I can get through. Hopefully her side‚Äôs hallway is clear. 



**Entry 25** - Friday, 2:42 PM

I was able to make my way into Chloe‚Äôs room. I had to hammer out the vent and some of the drywall to get through into her room. I made quick work of it, but still the sound seemed to draw more attention from those outside my door. I am just thankful the second floor walls are not built with cinder blocks like the first. 

Chloe is sitting on her bed busy taking apart the cable rope I brought and braiding it into a stronger, much longer rope. She is even more beautiful than I had imagined. She has an adorably small nose, slightly pointed ears, and dark brown hair against bright green eyes.

I put everything we had that could potentially be useful and packed it tightly into my backpack. We are almost ready to check the hallway. It sounds like it is still empty.



**Entry 26** - Friday, 3:30PM 

Let it suffice to say that a lot has happened since the last time I wrote. We are holed up inside a storage closet on the first floor. We made it down Choles‚Äô hallway only to have the power go out on us once we made it to the stairwell. Some emergency lighting went on but the lighting is minimal at best. 

When we peered out of the stairwell, it was hard to make out much but there appeared to be a lot of people moving around towards the other end of the hallway. At that point, we decided to head back to the second floor and see if we could pry one of the windows open to scale down with my cable. But once we headed that way we heard movement coming towards us from the upper floor where we just came from. We had to make a run for it out into the first floor hallway. 

Luckily, I was able to open a nearby storage closet with the teddy bear keyring I had stolen yesterday from the nurse‚Äôs office. We are now hiding in the closet with our backs against the wall holding the door closed with our feet. It smells like there is smoke coming from somewhere in the building. 

I‚Äôm guessing there are around 10 people outside trying to get in, scratching on the door and groaning. We are going to try and wait it out, whatever ""it"" may be. Been in here for about 20 or 30 minutes now. I‚Äôm starting to worry about the fact that the smoke is getting thicker. 



**Entry 27** - Friday, 4:07 PM

After sitting in the closet for about 40 minutes Chloe started hyperventilating. Apparently she has asthma and the smoke was making it hard for her to breathe. I knew we couldn‚Äôt make it much longer sitting in the closet so I went out into the hallway. It sounded like most of the people had lost interest in us by then so I thought it would be safe. When I opened the door I saw that the only one still out there was case manager Doug.

He was almost unrecognizable. He had a gash on his neck where it looked like someone had torn off a sizeable chunk of flesh. He had the same black eyes, sandpaper goosebumps, and pale skin as Joey. 

He was trying to grab me with his hands but he was missing most of his fingers, so ended up just smacking me uselessly with his palms. I kept trying to grab him and shake some sense into him. Yelling at him asking what was going on. He got me to the ground and had almost bitten me until Chloe jumped out of the closet and bashed his temple with the hammer. His head nearly exploded and brain matter flew all over. I could hardly move when Chloe dragged me back into the closet as more of them starting coming in our direction.

All the commotion and noise seemed to attract others back to the area. So now we are back in the closet holding the door closed. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if there are any sane people left in the building or if everyone has gone crazy. Starting to feel like we are caught up in a zombie movie.

Don‚Äôt know what we are going to do, there sounds like there are a very large group of people outside the door now. We can‚Äôt stay much longer. There is definitely a fire raging somewhere in the building and it is getting closer. This might be the end of my escape. I can at least take comfort that I will die with Chloe.

A couple of weeks ago I went out partying. We used coke, 2cb, ketamine and such.

Finding dope in my jacket that is. But it just got sooooooo much weirder. 





I cooked up a few filters from my pre Xmas speedball binge and got well, when I noticed the tooter I used during that last partying weekend. I only thought about the coke and nothing else when I rinsed the tooter and shot the rinse. Well, it's been  ketamine and I feel like I'm sitting inside a Christmas ornament that's hanging from a tree and holy fucking shit, if I wasn't as experienced as I am, I'd freak the fuck out right about now. Experiencing Iv ketamine when you expected a rinsed speedball - even if it's just the tooter residue - isn't for everyone.

I was using heroin for a year or two (estimated at 1-2 points a day, if that, I had no income) as of March 13th 2017 I was on Suboxone. Started on 4 mg, worked my down to 2, then 1, and now roughly 0.5 mg. I acknowledge that my endorphins have downregulated, now I'm looking for a healthy effective way to reverse that. I just ordered DLPA, and some kratom to help with the acute withdrawals. I have baclofen on the side as well as 5-HTP. How in the world would I go about upregulating my endorphins? I have strong history of depression and anxiety, specifically agarophobia and panic disorder. My main concern is endorphin upregulation. BUT it'd be very helpful to know how to upregulate all my neurotransmitters i.e. dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, glutamate. Those last two aren't talked about usually. Thank you to anyone who has the time to help me. I can't take much more of these mental illnesses.

Worth noting: have tried antidepressants, I'm very unresponsive to them. And don't feel like benzos are a healthy way to fix my problem long term.",1514409183.0

I just want to thank you for your input once again and also provide a little update to this opiate soap opera. I guess I ‚Äújumped the shark‚Äù as they say. Even though we had gotten to know each other over a few months, hung out quite a bit and even went so far as to be pretty intimate with each other (interpret that how you will. I don‚Äôt kiss and tell) we had to go a few days without seeing each other over the holidays. I knew he had a family and I am not a home wrecker. I stopped hearing from him for a few days and finally decided to send an ‚Äúultimatum‚Äù message. I did not expect the reply that I received. It was from a family member who advised me that he was currently in withdrawal. I was told that when he got his life together then he would be able to decide if I was ultimately a good influence or a bad influence and he‚Äôd be better able to decide if he wanted to go back to his ex wife, be with me, with someone else or no one at all. 

I responded back to his family memeber by stating that I cared for him and wanted what was best for him. I said that I wasn‚Äôt some junkie slut that was constantly looking for the next thrill. I said that I just wanted him to be happy and healthy and be able to make decisions based on what his heart wants and not what his addiction wants. 

So folks, that‚Äôs where we are. I am once again lonely. However, I have dropped my useage down quite a bit because I was inspired to do so on the off chance he does decide to be a part of my life after this detox.

Couple other questions. 1) how long does it take to hit you
2) can you mix with anything to help the taste? Haven‚Äôt tried it yet but heard it‚Äôs gnarly 
3)can it be saved for later? If so can I just crush up like 2 doses and drink half at some point and the other half when I need it again?

Started at 5 mg hydro twice a day up to 4x 30 MS ER and 4x 15 OC IR over time as my tolerance rose. I've never copped in the street and the worst I've been through is stretching out my last little bit to wait for my mail or borrowing some pills from someone and paying back after I get my refill. A couple of times were my fault and a couple of times were the VA screwing up by not shipping my meds to be delivered Saturday when my new script started Monday.

I've been going pretty extreme to get myself completely off. I'm set to have surgery in 18 and I don't want to be on the other side of recovery taking even more than my previous highest dose just to stay well not to mention manage the pain.

I've been using Kratom here and there, but this latest key is garbage compared to what I had before or I just don't respond well to this vein. I've also got a script for 3600 mg gabapentin for neuropathy and a script for 200 mg Modafinil for second shift sleep disorder. I've found that a combo of these two makes going between doses a hell of a lot easier. My pharmacist at the VA also hooked me up with some Meloxicam for an anti inflammatory so I don't fuck my stomach up with Ibuprofen and she refilled my old trazodone script to help me on nights where I can't sleep.

So where I'm at now is 10.5 - 30 mg of OC a day. I've completely stopped taking my morphine and I've been trying to get by quartering my 15s, but sometimes I take half at a time to get by. My tapering symptoms have been RLS, Cold Feet, Sneezing (fuck this in particular), Diarrhea, and I've been insanely horny. Like my libido all came back at once. 

I've been able to deal with most of this pretty well so far. I'm just wondering at what point do I just say fuck it and jump off for good and ditch my shit? Does anyone else have this same kind of experience that could lend me some of their wisdom? Even words of encouragement would be nice. I'm just tired of being Me plus opes.

How best to dose though? As the sought out effects are mainly from Tramadol's metabolites such as o-dsmt. If one were to take a high dose in one go then the total level of o-dsmt in plasma would be lower than if the Tramadol had been incrementally dosed? Due to enzyme saturation and drug elimination.

I have access to 200mg ER.

Here are some potential dosing schedules seeking the best euphoria.

T - 0 : 200mg (Whole and intact)

We call them caps here, because they come in capsules. Anyways, I have a chance to be with someone who is not cool at all with opiates (give her speed and well....lol). 


But I did my last bag actually, because it was ECP that I ordered.  I've had 2 relationships since high school.

The first one, overdosed after 3 weeks of us dating. 


The second one was stabbed to death, by her brother, over who got to sell the laptop for heroin.


Needless to say I thought I was cursed, and I think that's the reason I used. If I used, I wouldn't care about finding someone and having them die in some weird way in less then a month. 


Fucking sucks being a person of interest at 16.


I may chip from time to time even after, maybe once a month, if that, but wish my luck. I may be the one guy who sucessfully got off a 12 year habit, got clean, started chipping, and stopped.

One of my friends told me something that just reminded me how some people can really just think of us as scum of the earth. l don‚Äôt think being a user in itself can make you a bad person. However, I‚Äôm sure some have done things that make them a bad person, but that‚Äôs in all areas of life.

So my friend has this boyfriend and he‚Äôs sort of what you would call a silverspoon type of guy, being born into a rich family and the guy is really privileged. Just dealt a good hand in life...nothing wrong with that. 

He knew a kid from highschool that overdosed and died recently. He said this is one of many that has happened this year. And he said something along the lines of ‚Äúyeah, just don‚Äôt see how someone would want to live that kind of life. They‚Äôre all just worthless junkies.‚Äù 

And wow, this type of stuff gets to me. Of course he doesn‚Äôt even have a clue what it‚Äôs like to be in the shoes of someone like us. Being dealt a really good hand in life, it doesn‚Äôt surprise me that he would never fathom the possibility of something like that happening to his self. 

And it‚Äôs not just this specific situation that necessarily makes me upset. It‚Äôs just how some people can judge someone without hesitation. Not even giving thought to things that were going on in someone‚Äôs head or what kind of circumstances that the person had to live with. 

And in the same way that l don‚Äôt understand how someone wouldn‚Äôt show empathy towards another, is the same way that someone can look at us can‚Äôt understand why we would do the things we do. 

Just wanted to share this. l hope we can be understanding of people too before we judge. l feel like the life we live makes us more open minded because we‚Äôve experienced a wide variety of life experiences that might give us an edge on the empathy side.

So I started this induction process last night.

I did my usual amount for the day (around 2 bundles, and a couple extra bags since I knew it was coming to an end) and took .2mg of Sublingual Suboxone @12am as well as 3 shots of heroin. I felt completely fine, maybe a little bit of a stomach ache, but proceeded to get nice nods and fall asleep.

Woke up the next morning completely fine. Bought some dope, been getting high all day, and currently have the Suboxone (.2mg) under my tongue, waiting for it to dissolve. 

Tomorrow, I think it‚Äôs suggesting I take .8mg in the AM, and 1mg later that night.

However... I am D E A T H L Y afraid that PWD is gonna hit me because .8mg seems like a lot for being on a full antagonist, no??? Does anyone have any advice, experience, or research with this method that they can give me and help me out with? I am absolutely desperate to get off of heroin... and I need to make sure I get this right tomorrow. Took me a lot of will power to put that tab in last night and start the process, and I almost forgot tonight because I was nodding out - however I got the job done and I‚Äôm excited. I‚Äôm really excited. I was dancing as I let the film dissolve.

Really need the help!!! Please and thank you to those that respond. I will be responding probably immediately to those who have advice/tips so please - HELPME!!!",1514522979.0

Our author has the unique ability to take readers on an epic adventure of the heart, body, soul and mind. It‚Äôs truly a series that no one asked for yet the author seemes pop out these updates more continuously than you can ‚Äúpop a molly and sweat‚Äù. 

Sorry...I thought that would be a funny way to introduce yet another update on my current situation. I review books and a lot of the promotional shit that these companies put in their advertisements reads exactly like what I‚Äôve written above. On to the update!! 

If you haven‚Äôt read my previous two posts (or at least the first one, you‚Äôll be totally confused. So give it a read) 

I was finally able to speak with the person I‚Äôm crushing on. He told me everything that happened and told me that I was on his mind the entire time. He was worried I would think that he lost interest and quit talking with me or that he had picked his ex over me etc. 
He said thinking about upsetting me or hurting my heart made his withdrawals that much worse, but he felt like he deserved it. I was just elated to get to talk to him directly and not just get an update from a family member. He said that he is going to rehab in the near future and that his mother took his phone from him so that he couldn‚Äôt call any of his connects. He does have access to a computer and that‚Äôs how we are staying in touch for now. We have exchanged addresses so that we may send each other snail mail and I‚Äôve given him my number again so that he can memorize it/write it down to keep with him on the off chance he gets to use a phone. He said that knowing that I still care is really helping him get through this detox. 

I guess I just feel very alone now. I am detoxing too, but I don‚Äôt have a support system or a family that is privy to what I‚Äôm dealing with (which he does have these things and I‚Äôm happy about that). I don‚Äôt want to seem emotional, but fuck you guys...this is hard. I miss him a lot. I just keep going through the motions. Wake up, get ready, go to work, come home, shower, read a bit, go to bed, rinse and repeat. I eat if I feel like it. I try not to think about using. I just wish I could talk to him. But hell I‚Äôm lucky we have a source of communication at all again. 
I‚Äôm thinking about asking his mom if I can come see him on New Years Eve. I‚Äôll tell her she can strip search me or what ever she needs to do in order to feel comfortable that I‚Äôm NOT bringing him anything. The last thing I‚Äôd want to do is fuck up this opportunity for him. 
My heart hurts worse than these damned body aches. 
If any of you guys have advice on how I can manage my personal journey with this, I‚Äôd appreciate it. I feel like this community has been there for me more than my only sister. 
I love you guys, thanks for being your crazy selves *hugs for all*

One Little Spider

I had the freedom of a fly,

Tenacity of a hornet.
 
Quick to sting,

With little to no warning.

But now I'm a spider,

Stuck to his own web.

With this string around my ankle,

Thoughts of freedom fill my head.

So I have to adapt,

It's either that or die.

Learn a whole new skill set,

To trap my former-fellow flies.

Bring them to me,

With honey, no vinegar.

But even for a spider,

I'm really not that sinister.

I want to keep them around,

Never set my pets free.

And if I'm going down with the ship,

Then I might as well have company.

Cut the ropes to the life boats,

Send them out to sea.

Sinking into this self spun web.

I guess that's where I'm gonna be.

It's interesting as well because misery loves company and if you're in a bad, fucked up situation, it's almost human nature to want to entice people into the same lifestyle. But people don't do that here so I think you're a kind bunch, really.

I'm not saying you're all miserable or anything like that but still I do feel the overwhelming advice is to stay away and get clean if you're already hooked.

I haven't used opiates in about 70 days and I think about opiates probably 3 hours a day. Visiting this sub helps me not relapse. So, thank you.

So I ask buddy if he knew they were fake and he gave me a bs story on how he didn‚Äôt know they were fake and they were fucking him up when took them. 

So my first thought is they‚Äôre fent presses. So my curiosity got the best of me and I snorted one. I snort one and I didn‚Äôt get anything off it. I assumed they were just presses with nothing in them. So 20 mins later I decided to bang one and that‚Äôs when I noticed something really odd. I got a rush like cocaine. My heart was flying and I couldn‚Äôt sit down. I gave my partner one and they described the same thing I did, a cocaine like rush/high. 30 mins later we are both perfectly fine and no longer high. 

Needless to say we didn‚Äôt do business and we went our separate ways. Basically I just want to know if anyone had had a similar experience with presses like these or have heard of an upper in roxy presses? Would greatly appreciate any and all input. Thanks.

The feeling it gives you is EXTREMELY unpleasant. The first time I did it I was seconds away from calling 911 because I thought I was dying.

I think that part may have been my anxiety cause I knew I just took some crazy chemical and had no idea how long it was gonna last or if it was gonna get worse. Luckily it only last about 45 minutes.

Trying to get a clue as to what it was I looked to see if my pupils dilated or constricted or if they got all red. None of that happened. I've talked to a few other of his customers and they said it did it to them too. Like it gave them massive social anxiety and they just felt all weird.

Sure, someone might power through it and become a minority in doing so, but when the sickness becomes too overbearing and you are lying in your own sweat, vomit, tears and shit you finally feel well enough to maybe eat and drink something from your damp bed sheets; you will only get the strength back to go out and cop again.  Seriously.  My time in Boston and again on New Year's '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15.  

I've been addicted to opiates since 2010 and have been an addict since 2001.  I'm 32 now and jobless living with my rents hoping to see 2018.  Sure, I've been lucky enough to find myself in a clinic since 2015 with a stint of relapses on occasion and I feel as if I'm the living dead.  I'm past due for my expiration date. I've been spoon fed 
pharmaceuticals from antidepressants to antipsychotics and won't take it unless it's got a black label notice.  Quacks; being in and out of rehabs, jail, and mental facilities I finally find some solace in being ok with myself knowing I should have been dead a long time ago.  

May god rest her soul, but seeing my friends sister dead in a coffin laying there peaceful in her eternal slumber made my bones envious more so than upset.  Knowing if you are reading this now then you are at least able to know that you are breathing, and feeling ok enough to think that being alive isn't fun unless you are being put on some kind of narcotic.  I am more than jaded and paranoid looking over my shoulder since I can remember and it's finally to the point that even drugs don't even give me a form of escape that I yearn for.  

I've tried suicide more times than I can count and a 10 bag shot of fire dope can't cut through my 100mg methadone daily dose to black me out of this hell we call life.  I know in death there is where we find true peace and love.  The love here is temporary and fleeting.  It's uncontrollable and unpredictable.  I know this is sounding morbid and dark, but is it where we fret and shy away from the bad things we call horrors just the only thing that we all will face eventually.  

I've been giving a ""nickel ride"" in 2015 around the time of Freddie Grey's death. Put handcuffs on your wrists as tight as you can behind your back and sit in a squatting position for 2-3 hours and then you can feel the torture I've been through.  I've been legally kidnapped and beaten by the people swore to protect us, but because I use a substance deemed illegal by sheltered minds, I deserve being pulled out of my running car, by plain clothed ""officers"" not knowing if they really are the ""good guys' and manhandled until I rat on my friends whereabouts.  Of course I wasn't going to put him through what I've been through and so without drugs or reason they are allowed to just kidnap you because they have this thing called ""probable cause""...  Those are just a couple of injustices everyone on this board may and can face in the U.S. or Philadelphia.  (Fuck philly it's overrated and too hot for this shit)

I hope all of you have a great New Years and hope your resolutions are to find a middle ground for your habits and get into a maintenance program or long term treatment facility, because cold turkey and self abstinence will NOT work.  I wish you luck, but don't kid yourself.  Here's to a New Year and new beginnings.  Here is too the loved ones and people we know who died from their battles with opiate addiction and too the boys in blue who get hard ons putting people like you and I though hell to give themselves a sense of accomplishment.

Should I do a CWE?,"I've seen a LOT of different information on the internet from people saying to stay under 1000mg to websites saying usually single doses under 7000mg aren't toxic... Although I have found practically nothing that described a single dose limit except for FDA guidelines, so I am curious what y'all consider a ""safe"" SINGLE dosage of acetaminophen for you? 

I've ALWAYS stayed under the 3,000 mg limit, but have never once stayed under the 1,000 mg single dose limit (Usually I'll go 1600mg APAP in one dose. Maybe twice a week) 

So do you think I'm doing any damage to my liver? What is YOUR limit? 

Now I read from a chart called ""Recommendation For Referral To Emergency Department (ED)"" that says Acute, Single, Unintentional Ingestion of Acetaminophen"" which says ""Refer to ED if estimated acute ingestion is: Unknown OR at least 10 grams or 200 mg/kg"" 

Link for that is here: https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/acetaminophen-toxicity-what-pharmacists-need-to-know

From the above quote, would you assume that a single, one time dose on a healthy individual is not usually a cause for emergency unless it is 10 g or 200mg/kg? That would seem like a LOT. 

Is it possible that one time use of a high dose (4g and up) is not as dangerous as the accumulative effects of 4g's every day? ",1514579757.0

I have an ok family, few close friends and a woman I love dearly. 

The reason why I‚Äôm telling all this is that I‚Äôd like yall to know that I‚Äôm not depressed, suicidal or whatever it is that makes people wanna do heroin but ever since my father was diagnosed with ALS, I lost faith in God and started hurting people that I care about the most, especially my mother and my future fiancee. Then I started smoking cannabis on weekends because a friend of mine said it would help me relax but all it ever did for me was giving me anxiety and shitty thoughts even tho I kinda liked the high. 

A few days ago I went to this barber and I kinda just let it all out and told him about my life for some reason. Guess I just had to vent or whatever and he was like I know a guy who has what you need but you gotta think long and hard if you really wanna do it or not. I asked what could it possibly mean and he was like ‚Äúyou ever done h?‚Äù I said i ll think about it and looked it up online and all I ever got was prejudiced websites telling people only about the risks and side effects and saying shit like ‚Äúnot even once‚Äù or whatever so I wanted to ask about unprejudiced opinions about this substance to people who actively do it on the regular and could give me the best advice.

So in all seriousness, is it ok to do it a couple of times to.. let s say go on a spiritual journey and find peace even for a couple of days?

I really really just wanna get away for a while.

Had major shoulder surgery, and even though they gave me hydros and percs that didn‚Äôt do shit, I used it as my reasoning for using. Of course it also helped with the mundaneness (that a word? Fuck it) of being in grad school and hours of PowerPoints, studying, etc. 

But I digress. Fuck it. I‚Äôm ready to be clean. I tapered to where 1.5 lasted basically 10 days over holidays, waking up to wet dreams and all that shit but still managed to be normal during that time. I‚Äôm going in two days to die for hopefully only 3-5 days of hell. Part of me wants to barely have anything, to embrace the pain and withdrawals as punishment. But there‚Äôs the other side of me that‚Äôs a little bitch, and wants it to be as smooth as possible to ensure I stick to the plan. 

My question for you guys- I‚Äôm going to get bars, herb, and I already have two halves of sub for when I failed earlier. Is this going to be enough you think? My bro says to not worry about subs, for it‚Äôs going to prolong the suck a bit, and the offchance I get stuck on those. I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on shit anymore, and just become a stoner again. How many totem poles should I get? I‚Äôll prob get some soft just for shits too, to give me something to look forward to? 

I plan to have fun today, I should‚Äôve just jumped off yesterday after the taper I basically did but fuck it. I still have some at home that I don‚Äôt want to just throw out or give away. I worked for that shit dammit! Lol

I plan to also use this as a diary of sorts. I 100% am ready, and if this can help one other person who is in the same boat I am then that‚Äôs worth it to me, fuck you haters! 

So TLDR- definitely herb and nerves will be utilized. Yay or nay to subs? I have gotten sick off of them prior to my habit so I doubt I‚Äôll continue to use them, but could that be an issue? Has it been for anyone?

**Why do you think most people OD?** By 'why' I mean what is the common scenario - is it usually overestimating tolerance after a clean period? Accidentally buying fakes cut with fentanyl? Just the progression of addiction and ever higher tolerance? What else?

I'm especially curious about fentanyl - do people mostly do fentanyl on purpose or by accident? I was talking to an ER nurse in Portland last night and she didn't think fentanyl fakes were that big a deal...her patients just OD because they buy fent to save money and then just take more and more until they end up in the ER.

veins on my left hand work but then when I inject there and the shit starts to circulate up my arm the whole arm goes red and puffy (assuming the main vein the little hand veins connect to is destroyed)

Right hand veins are thin as a hair, nothing fits in there, too damaged and my right arm has been pretty untouched throughout the past few years..mainly because it's trash. couldn't find a vein there even in the start of my iving. 

I hate shooting feet..too many nerves and it just hurts too much. like my whole foot will be on fire for 5-10 min. also my leg/feet circulation is garbage because I used to iv tar into my feet and it left its mark.  Is there any way I can find an easily accessible vein or even artery (idc I know it's bad). maybe upper arm? I'm super skinny but for me it's always just had too much flesh/mass to be viable that high up. i have someone who can  push the plunger in if need be. not physically insert the needle though, she'd never ever do that.

Is it worth it to go pelvic area(as in upper pelvic near my stomach) or legs? 
not interested in going neck as the drugs need to dilute in my blood because of how acidic they are+ I'm allergic to something in the pills so it spikes my bp up super high every time I inject even in my hand. can't imagine the reaction id get with my neck.

***I don't inject heroin, I inject morphine and methadone both of which are caustic as fuck in the pill form I extract it from. again yes it's bad but withdrawal is worse so whatever.


(I use a 27 g 1/5 needle. can't use anything smaller because I inject a 5 ml solution per drug in separate shots, so 5 ml pull out, find a spot..again.. then 5 ml. willing to switch to 30g if necessary, it just takes a while to push everything in)


I'm trying to taper down and my recent inability to find viable injection sites has reeeaaallly been a pain in the ass. I end up missing half way through and end up having to do more drugs which messes it all up. in the past 2 days I've pretty much doubled my dose because I keep messing up because my veins are just...gone

- Started using Oxy about 2.5 years ago. 20mg would have me in heaven.
- Would go weeks or months between uses at first. 
- Over time this progressed to 4-5 day binges once a month, every month. The reason I didn't use more is because I'm out of the UK a lot and have no access then.
- 20mg doesn't do anything for me now, even with weeks off. 40mg is what I need to feel good but there are many days I've taken 120mg in a day. 
- I don't know if I've ever been physically addicted. I've felt absolutely terrible at the end of binges but not sure if that's just from binging on oxy and coke. That said, a couple of days after binges I've felt terrible, then taken an Oxy and magically felt completely better. so it seems likely I was in withdrawal. 
- I think about Oxy every day, for multiple hours every day. I'm about 70 days clean at the moment. My thoughts are still, 'Maybe if I just go back to using once a month I can get the lovely effects without the downsides'.
- Work couldn't be going better, have a good marriage and am in great physical shape. 
- I visit this sub every day. Almost salivate when I see some of the pill porn.

I should never use opiates again, right?",1514721199.0

been getting a bunch of bullshit lately. it sucks. i got beat for 80 fuckin dollars tonight while i was sick, ended up with a dub of very low quality tar. some sad shit. i'm not really doing anything special tomorrow night but i wanna have a nice time w my girl and that's not gonna be so easy if i'm as sick as i was earlier today. i managed to save about 4 puffs of this garbage for the morning, but that won't hold me for long. i should be able to get ripped off and end up with a miniscule amount of dope that can sort of keep me off sick for a few hours tomorrow. i really don't see myself not getting fucked in the ass by the universe like usual tho. 

so, i'd like to try to get a little bit high tomorrow night. i have a few T3's laying around. think that's my best chance at getting a little buzz on tbh. so, 330mg codeine phosphate, approx. equivalent to 45mg morphine (possibly as much as 75mg actually tho? i'm seeing diff info). i have ~100mg dxm, bunch of dph, and two boxes of lope. i've never used dxm for potentiation. is it actually worth bothering? i'll prob skip the dph, makes me too drowsy. i do also have a few grams of some red vein kratom as well. even if i get some dope, i'll need all the help i can get.

*****************************************************
so i guess my questions are...

any problems with kratom + codeine? i'm hoping the combo of the two super light highs might produce one mild high. god i'm desperate lmao.


i'm a heroin addict. am i gonna feel this shit at all? thing is, my tolerance really isn't that high rn. the tar i've been getting is such low quality, i might make a G last me 2 days or more, but there's no way there's more than like 50mg of any actual dope in there. i swear. so if i've been dosing like 10mg diamorphine at a time and getting some relief, maybe even a little buzz, maybe 330mg codeine will get me somewhere.

is there any place for the lope here? will the effects ""stack"", will it block the effects, will it do nothing at all? 

boofing codeine is a dumb idea, right? i've never boofed anything but i'd totally start now if it was worth it. 

thanks for reading lmao, hopefully i can actually get a slight buzz going tomorrow night, we'll see.",1514715976.0

Looking for advice and insight!!!,"Hey all- so I've been dabbling for quite a few months with 30mg rocks. Anywhere between 2-8 a day. Snorting is my induction method (though I understand orally has the highest absorption concentration). At first it was great.

Now, I don't feel the euphoric, warm, fuzzy, high anymore. Whether I do 2, or 8, after about 15mins I just get dizzy, lightheaded, and uncomfortable.  Any clue what the issue may be or how to fix this? I'll say that if I stop for a week or two, I'll get an okay high for a day but then immediately I go back to the dizzy lightheaded uncomfortableness.   I don't think that it is tolerance since as I do more, I get more uncomfortable and dizzy. I don't really feel high (and trust me, I took plenty to see if that was the issue). My buddies thinks it's tolerance but it doesn't really make sense as I've done plenty and if I do too much, I just increase my dizziness and restlessness...not my high 

It sounds like I potentially may have a chemical imbalance or something is not producing properly internally. Is there any supplement, or anything in addition I can be taking to help this?

Curious to know if anyone else has experienced something similar.  It's difficult to explain, but now I just get uncomfortable agitated and dizzy if I take for more than a day and would like this no longer to be the case.

7n7ezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7n7ezi/my_story/,33,https://redd.it/7n7ezi,nopulseoflife77,My story...,"It started when I was 18. I grew up with a very liberal but very anti drug family. The first hard drug I ever tried was ecstasy. It was amazing and I thought what else is everyone lying to me about. I felt like drugs were keys to doors to feelings and thoughts that you can‚Äôt experience any other way and I wanted to try and experience everything. Coke was the next thing I tried and I loved it. But my mom found out and put me into rehab. 

When I got out I went down to FL to live with my dad and immediately went looking for coke. I found it and then one day the guy I was getting it from said that he couldn‚Äôt get anymore blow that day but asked me would I like to try some oxys, they were cheaper and felt amazing, I was in love . That got me on opiates. Back then in FL they still had the pill mills so my guy set me up with a fake MRI and script history. I went to two mills and each one wrote me 250 oxy 30s. It got really bad when I would run out of my scripts before I could get more the next month. Then one day they passed a law that everyone had to check all the patients history‚Äôs and I was cut off. 

So I decided to leave and move in with my sister in Baltimore. That‚Äôs when I was introduced to heroin. If you have ever seen The Wire then you know what my life was like in Baltimore. That show is 100% accurate. This whole time I am not shooting up just sniffing my dope which I think saved me. That lasted 2 years and then my sister found out and kicked me out. 

I got lucky and got offered a job out west at a ski resort.  A friend let me crash on his couch and and detox. Then I moved out west. I couldn‚Äôt find  coke or heroin out there so I started using mushrooms, LSD and DMT. I wasn‚Äôt using psychedelics to expand my consciousness, I was using them to get fucked up as much as could. I took so many shrooms one night that I broke my ankle and didn‚Äôt even feel it till I got to the hospital over an hour away. The paramedics were in shock how calm I was. I then got a connect in CA and started moving blow back and forth making a good amount of money. I must have stepped on the wrong toes because I only made a few trips before I got robbed at gunpoint. 

I decided to cut my losses and moved to Key West where I started using lots of coke again. I only lived in the Keys for a few months before my mom offered me a job in her company as a sales rep in AL. I got completely clean. I started exercising and really started making the right choices.  I met the love of my life and prepared to ask her to marry me. With in a couple months my girl dumped me, my grandmother died and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. 

It was just too much and so I started using heroin again and I quickly turned from snorting to shooting. Didn‚Äôt take long for my mom to find out and fire me. So that‚Äôs my story, I am going into rehab next week and hopefully I finally get my addiction under control. But for the first time In my life I don‚Äôt have any hope. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll make it and I don‚Äôt care if I do. Sorry to end on such a depressing note. I hope someone reads this and decides not to go down this awful path. ",1514707625.0

[(https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7n3xr2/everett_wa_needle_cleanup_behind_a_home_depot/drzew10/?context=10000)]

**I'm giving you all fair warning now, it's a bit of a wall of text, so if you don't like reading - turn around now.**

Sorry for the wall of text - you don't need to read any of this if you don't want. It was cathartic just to be able to type it all out.

I speak from experience and one of the big problems I've had is the fact that drug use (especially harder drugs like heroin or meth) is (or seems to be) looked down upon. People tell you ""Why don't you just quit?"" (can't count how many times I've heard that). You feel (or at least I do) so guilty about your choice to use drugs and you feel afraid to tell people because of what you think they might say or that they won't understand.

I will say, the one time I went to detox, I felt very welcomed and understood. None of the nurses seemed to be judging me, they all seemed to want the best for me (genuinely). A lot of the nurses I talked to had kids or loved ones who battled with or were still battling with addiction and it gave them an inside look at what it's like. I think that really helps, parents with kids who battle addiction I think is the closest you can get to experiencing withdrawal without actually going through it. I remember when I was trying to quit cold turkey one time at my Dad's house and he came into my room on day 2 and he was beside himself... he kept telling me he just wished he could take all the pain away from me and let him take the burden. I know he would if he could too... that's just my Dad. I love him to death.

So many times when I'm talking to people about addiction, specifically opiate (heroin) addiction, they bring up ""just quitting"". I've always wished so badly that I could give them a day of what I feel like on day 2 or 3 of intense withdrawal. I've never experienced anything like it, it's hell on earth. People can try and compare it to the flu x 10 or whatever, but unless you've FELT it.... it just isn't the same. I would take any flu over bad heroin withdrawal.

I will say, in detox the process was the most comfortable I've ever been when detoxing. I was able to eat and even sleep due to the meds they were giving me. I've been wanting to go back because I need to give it another try... lest I end up dead from complications from IV use, broke and homeless, or worse. I'm just nervous, I know this is a totally paranoid thought, but coming back to detox I'd feel like a failure in their eyes. Like they tried their best with me once and I fucked it up.  I know this is irrational because I knew guys in there that were on their 10th+ times.

I don't think it helps that I'm already social anxious to begin with, so when you couple that with heroin use... well, it's not pretty. I'm already super high strung and up in my head about a lot of things. I always have been. Anxiety and depression run in my mom's family and I'm sure I've got a bit of that.

Then, once detox is over, I feel great for a week or two while the drugs slowly come out of my system and then it's back to boredom, restless legs, inability to get any good sleep. Boredom mainly. I've been using for so long, it's all I find fun anymore. When I was a kid I used to play PC games religiously (it was an addiction of it's own, no doubt) but when I try to go back to them when I'm sober, the interest just isn't there.

I'm not sure what the answer is for me or others, but I hope someone finds some kind of miracle cure. Wishful thinking, I know. I'll keep thinking of ways to help and if I ever get clean, I want to make it a mission in life to help other addicts. I know the pain all too well and if I could help just one other addict get and stay clean, it would make me so immensely happy.  In order to do any of that, I need to get clean first myself, I know this.  I'm just not sure when or how it will happen.  I've only been to detox once and after that I went to a rehab, which I promptly left after 4 or 5 days.  It just didn't feel like it was for me.  I'm shy by nature and that environment doesn't benefit people who are shy or timid. 

I'm not a bad person, I'm really not... I've done things I'm not proud of, but I still try my best to make the world a better place - even while in the throes of addiction.  I do believe I still have a moral compass and it leads to me getting scammed, ripped off, betrayed by so called friends.  Even strangers I see that are struggling, maybe sick, I've broken them off pieces in the past expecting nothing in return... just because I know that feeling all too well.  Granted, this isn't something I do all the time and I have to have extra, but still.  How many other junkies can say the same?  I tend to believe 99.9% of addicts are only out for themselves but there are the rare few I've run into that surprise me.  For how long, I'm not sure.  But that's why I want to get clean - if I was clean and had my desire under control, I think I could help these people.  I'm sure they've had much worse lives than I have and if I can be a friend to them without the constant idea of heroin lingering in both of our brains, I think I could help.  Obviously, this is much further down the road, if ever.  Just wishful thinking on my part.

Try not to tear me apart too much - I know some of these ideas are a bit loony and I'll get shit about more than a few things.  I guess I just wanted to say exactly what's on my mind.",1514705760.0

Are you guys operating under the idea that less water = hit you harder? Unfortunately, when you push it in, it's diluted in liters of blood so that can't be true other than placebo (which can be strong to be fair.

Perhaps under the idea that the less in the rig, the less likely you are to miss some of the shot? Fair enough, but the reason I use as much water as possible for how many shots i want to do is so that even if I miss a little bit, it won't be much due to dilution as well as adding all that water makes it MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ABSCESS!!

Anyway, I just wanted to share my 0.02c regarding this issue in the name of Harm Reduction. Using more water to get to 80-100 units instead of 20-40 won't kill your buzz, but it'll make life a lot easier on your veins. Please share your thoughts.",1514693406.0

Ive done this once before without issue, im wondering other than the risk of infection from tap water and non sterile fitering, if the binders and fillers in the pill can still harm my lungs and heart etc? I know never to IV pills without micron filtering, but is subq safer?

I believe since it isnt directly into a vein, that the drug is absorbed and the filler powders get left behind. Is that right? And if so what happens to that material? Does it get broken down or absorbed?

Coming off a 200mg/day or more habit, oxy.

Soooo.....couple questions. What dosage of kpins? I have 1mg pills, plenty of them. Moderate tolerance. Was thinking 2mg every morning? Gonna be 2mg Xanax for sleep.

And if I can mask the physical symptoms of withdrawal, will that eliminate the stress that it puts on your heart?

I've gone through many times, but not at this heavy a dosage. And trying to be more calculated this time. Last dose was 10am this morning, and I'll be dry at LEAST 2 weeks til refill.

Thanks all!

Thank you","The title pretty much says it all. I have a Thc/Cbd ""oil"" vape pen, the kind with a disposable cartridge and rechargeable battery. An actual pen not those big ass vapes people get at vape shops or anything like that. I can post photos if necessary.  I want to refine black/BTH and then mix it in a cartridge or put it in an empty cartridge and smoke it out of the pen. 

Is it possible for someone to do this? I'm guessing in order to do so you'd have to melt it down and/or refine it to some degree. Which is cool because that'd be removing some of the impurities out and create a more potent substance. To melt it down Would it be similar to prepping a shot before shooting up? (I don't use needles and never have so I'm not too familiar with this)

Has anyone tried this before?


Some other questions If this is possible:
-So once it's melted down/refined and ready to be put in the cartridge would I need to mix it with the Thc/Cbd oil for it to properly work and smoke correctly? Or can it be a empty cartridge?

-is there any reason this shouldn't be done? 

I feel like it could be a good idea if you're a smoker considering you're melting it down and refining it getting a lot of the impurities removed so It could be a more potent substance and more discreet to smoke. And if mixed with the Thc/Cbd oil could be a hell of a combination lol

Would it be wasting any product or ineffective to go this route? If so, why/how?

If anyone has done this, has experience doing this, or other knowledge related to the subject please let us know your thoughts, experiences, instructions, etc please.

Does anybody else here have experience with travelling internationally - ideally into Columbia or other areas of South Central America - with a legal bupe prescription?

I have no one else to spill it to so figured id spill it here. A little over a week ago I had over 8 months of sobriety under my belt. Everything was great and being sober and away from the madness was amazing. I don't know why I slipped up there was no reason to do so, but I did and unfortunately addiction won me over once again. So I picked up a couple packs and a few more packs as the week went on I was still flying under the radar. As Friday came around I decided might as well get some coke and go all out since ive already lost all that I worked for the past 8 months. So between coke and h, I had and up and down weekend, no harm done. Christmas came around coke is gone but still doing h. I got my hands on some xans. Christmas night I was feeling great had some xans in me and was going to pick up some more h with an old ""friend"". while picking up the h the dealer had some crack so I said fuck it lets get that rolling as well. between the h, xans and crack I was on top of the world and bound to fall off. I made it home that night. and last thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital with my family around me in tears explaining to me that without my sister finding me at 4 in the morning gargling in my own vomit I wouldn't be alive.....Just like that 8 months clean and sober and within a week addiction almost took my life. Now sitting here typing this a few days later I'm still using just h. my family looks at me like I'm an alien and I cant just see the disgust in their eyes. I'm alone and feel worse than I ever have in my life. But I guess I can be thankful I'm still alive... Thanks for listening.

I have real chronic pain. I was in pain management. I left on my own .. just felt it was hurting more than helping me. My oxycodone dose worked it‚Äôs way up to about 360MG daily. I just felt sick all the time. I usually took 90mg 4x daily. I decided to go the sub route to get off and hoping that I would get some pain relief from the sub. To my surprise it actually has been working well. I am RX‚Äôd 16 mg daily. I have never taken more than 6mg at one time and never more than 12mg in a day. I took my last Oxy on 10/28/17 after being on opiates for 8 years. I am going to start cutting the sub down. I figure the quicker I can get off , the better. 

So now that you have the background ... I want that warm feeling .. that oxy heaven feeling. I know I am doing well and I know it‚Äôs dumb .. but if I break down how would it work. I want to be able to take some oxy in between some sub doses. Reduce it a little , take some oxy for 1/2 a day and go back to the sub. I do not want to risk any precipitated WD so there is that. I‚Äôm not gonna lie .. I have real pain .. but you and I know that‚Äôs not why I want the oxy. Any suggestions?

And opiates. Gonna smoke 2 cigarettes at midnight to ring in the new year, should be right at the peak of the hydro by then. Gonna stop using cigs at all 2018. Of all the drugs to start using at 25, cigarettes are the most stupid. You start smoking young, not a quarter of the way through your life. Gonna focus on getting a new job this upcoming year. I hate where I‚Äôm at with my current one. I‚Äôm a cashier/server at a burger place. Really nice place, cool company that runs it and cool coworkers and it‚Äôs actually a really fun job that I like a lot, I just hate that I feel stuck in it. My social anxiety and mood swings (probably undiagnosed bipolar disorder, we‚Äôll find out on Friday for sure) prohibit me from becoming a bartender let alone a manager which I would like to do.

Some days are great though and I love everyone who comes through the door but I‚Äôm gonna be 25 next month and I have a college degree that‚Äôs gonna be a year old come summer in something I don‚Äôt even want to do anymore. I live at home with my parents and hardly have any ‚Äòreal ‚Äô bills (weird complaint I know) or responsibilities. I have almost no friends outside of work save one and she‚Äôs really the only person I hang out with outside of work but of course I‚Äôve gone and fallen head over heals hopelessly, helplessly and haplessly in love with her.  She was the first person in forever who had gone out of her way to be my friend back in a time when I had no business having friends cause I was such an angry, pissed off jerk. She‚Äôs beautiful and sweet and lovely and good hearted and likes me and wants to spend time with me (baffles my mind that she does but lol) and is everything I want in a woman. I‚Äôve known her for years; but she‚Äôs married. Happily. With a kid. And he‚Äôs good for her.  (despite the occasional difficulties she‚Äôll tell me about). I can never have her. And fantasizing about calling her mine involves wishing something terrible to happen to him or their relationship which I would never want to see and so makes me a bad person for wanting her. Im stuck in a rut and I don‚Äôt know how to move on with my life. I love her. If I get a new job we won‚Äôt be able to bae as close as we are now. I feel stuck. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving me insane lately. I‚Äôve been experimenting with drugs and shit, especially opiates and I‚Äôm running steroids all because I can‚Äôt cope with where I‚Äôm at right now. I don‚Äôt love myself at all and so I don‚Äôt see myself with a future or anything. The funny thing is that despite that, i steadfastly believe in god and that he is good, that he is love. That he is all powerful, infinite and eternal.  But I don‚Äôt know where he is in all this. I don‚Äôt know what his divine plan is for me. I have a loving family who care about me and pray for me. They do everything in their power to help me but I go nowhere and I feel like I‚Äôm failing them, disappointing them.  Tonight I just want to feel good and forget about all of that. I don‚Äôt know that 50mg is gonna do very much though. My tolerance has gone up some which sucks.

My friend and I were only able to pull together about $25 to get right to enjoy new years with our respective friends and families. He told me to come get him and we drove to the area to meet his dude. His dude called and told us he left to re-up and we missed him by 20 minutes. After waiting over an hour for him to come back, we started getting nervous. I remembered that the best dboy I ever had lived about a quarter mile down the road from where we were but he went to jail and I hadn't done business with him for over a year. I mentioned to my buddy that I had a dude I used to see out that way and I was going to drive past his house. His car was there! I slowed down to try to remember which door was his, and wouldn't you know it he walks out the front door. I was so excited I stopped the car and yelled his name. After turning around and pulling in, he gave me his new cell phone number and hooked us up with twice as much as we would have got from my friends connect. He even asked us if we wanted brown dope or a fent mix. It was a million to one shot he would have been at his moms house or that he would have walked out at a time where I could get his new number and get my favorite plug back. Junkie Jesus definitely paid us a visit today. I am blown away at the fact that I randomly decided to drive past his house, that he was home, and walking out just as I was there.

You know when you can't pee? Here are some tips to get flowing.,"Any time I've had trouble peeing there has been a psychological component, especially before I discovered opiates. Sometimes it's just being in the same bathroom as someone you are uncomfortable being around, having to pee without a door or someone outright talking to you while you try to pee.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I just have to think about happy things. That new graphics card you bought... fixate on it mentally. That girl you hooked up with last month that you stopped talking to on good terms but gave great head... evoke that thought. 

That time you took command of the fleet and subdued the empire? Yeah, that can work.

The time you went to the soup kitchen and felt really pious about your actions, sure you can use that too if you're a smug prick who's prick won't pee. To each his/her own.

&nbsp;


Aside from successful past sexual experiences, recent financial successes, recent acquisitions of material posessions and memorable ""good energy"" moments being recalled there are other tricks to get peeing. 

&nbsp;

Before we continue, just last week I was visiting my friend and his wife and for some reason they did not have the TV on for the entire evening. We just sat there and talked and worked on our respective tasks. 

When it came time to use the bathroom there was no background noise except for their conversation and I just couldn't pee. I tried three times but just wasn't happening. Surely the suboxone I consumed that morning was contributing. 

Finally after leaving, I went down the block and behind a bank or insurance broker's building and found a nice cold yet cozy corner to offload my fluidic waste. In that case it was evident that it was mostly psychological but it is possible the at the cold air helped the process along.

&nbsp;


Finally, another more recent time when I was visiting my friend and his wife with the TV off I did do something else to get the flow started. Didn't bother blocking my ears shut... simply put on a movie and skipped to a favorite scene. Shortly thereafter the flow started.

* Sc-Fi series scenes work

* Anime--- all the cool shit that happens in any given Gundamverse.

* Stand-up comedy

* Even scrolling through instagram (doesn't always work).

* Letting the phone generate background noise of any kind from videos or music.


&nbsp;


I've tried sitting with a low success rate. The aforementioned tricks have worked best for me and even when we blame our opioids we can still leverage the psychological element of the issue to get pissed off (pun intended).",1514754159.0

I'd tried heroin once or twice about a year ago and enjoyed it but only bought it a few times as I was trying to get better (still am). I'm on methadone now and I rarely use but when I do it's almost always heroin. Just for the past two months or so. I had been dealing with only one connect for a month and a half, but recently met another one that I'd much rather deal with (always on time, friendly, gives deals when I buy in bulk, etc). For the first two weeks she actually had the same, if not similar dope to my last connect. It was a very dark brown, almost purpley when you looked at it under the light. It wasnt cut at all, and it was so good. But this week, her dope has been a different color and I notice when I hear my spoon and mix the shot there are small black specks on it sometimes. Whatever that is, it gets filtered out. But with the old dope it always free up brown, usually so dark it was almost opaque in the needle and it was hard to see the blood come into it. Now with this new dope, it draws up almost clear even when the shot knocks me right on my ass. It has a brown tint but the product itself is a lot lighter, doesn't seem to be cut more by her after she gets it from her guy, I usually meet her at her house as she gets home from picking up and she takes it right out of her own and weighs it out, and it's more of a tan colour. Once it's in the rig it looks like a light kinda murky brown, sometimes I can hardly see the brown and it looks almost clear. Now my question is regarding fentanyl. I know for a fact that the stuff she was selling before this didn't have fent in it, but I'm starting to think that this does and that it may be a lot. I meant to take pictures but woke up and did my last shot without remembering to take it. But based of my poor description would you assume that it's fent? If so, would it just be laced or would it be more fent than dope at this point? I'm beginning to think that it's mostly fent just because I've never seen any dope draw up into this colour.

So what do you guys think? Your input is highly appreciated lmao",1514744553.0

Just have a question regarding the extended release version of Nucynta (Tapentadol). 

My father has chronic Lyme Disease and is on a TON of meds for it. For those of you that don't know, it's a crippling illness that makes everyday activities next to impossible due to pain, cognitive issues, and other symptoms. That's a little besides the point, but he's the reason I have access to Nucynta. He doesn't like them and is about to switch meds, but he has a ton left... so before he flushes them, I grabbed one 200mg Nucynta ER for myself to try.

Now I'm by no means a frequent opiate user, but have tried some different ones throughout the past couple of years. Besides already trying my dad's Tramadol and initial release Nucynta, I've also tried Vicodin when my friend offered me some (he had them for a bad back injury), and I think I tried Percocet maybe once. They made me feel pretty good. If I had to compare, I think I liked the Vicodin the most, but its effects didn't last long. I did however also really enjoy the effects of the immediate release version of Nucynta (think it was 100mg). 

So anyways, today I have the opportunity to take a 200mg Extended Release Nucynta, and after plenty of research of safety and interactions with my other medicine (I also take 100mg of Wellbutrin for my (thankfully) fleeting depression and 30mg/day of Propranolol for anxiety). There were a few interactions, but nothing I was concerned about. Does anybody have any experience with the extended release version of this Nucynta medication? Is it a similar high to the immediate release version? I know it lasts longer obviously, but just looking to see what effects I'd get from this. 

Looking forward to taking this and am curious to hear your opinions about it. 

Thanks everyone and enjoy your opiates responsibly!  ",1514744085.0

And out comes this black, gelatinous, substance almost like a worm, and of course the remaining infection just oozes out behind it. Once the wormy thing comes out the infection seems to come out really quickly and easily, and it seems to clear up and start to heal right after that. This has happened twice now.

7nkbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nkbpc/my_story/,6,https://redd.it/7nkbpc,pillsonpillsonpills,My Story,"Bored outta my mind, figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to write something down. The following is my story with opiates. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, my best friend introduces me to roxy 30s, this is 6 years ago. I pop one, we chill at his place, didn‚Äôt feel nothing and thought it was the biggest waste of $25 and would of much rather a ‚Äúdub‚Äù (this is when I was starting to get big into maryjane). My background is white upper middle class I would suggest and my friends family had a lot more money. I get my wisdom teeth out, I get a script of Perc 5s. Same day I got them out my mom gave me 3 of the perc 5s and a xanax. That was the first time I ever got high off percs and right away could tell why people got addicted and liked them. Thinking about it, my mom easily finished half the script. That was my first ever taste, I wouldn‚Äôt do oxy again until my third year in college. I had a party  for my high school graduation and that same best friend before asked if I wanted to get some roxys for my grad party And i said sure. Gave him the money, never saw him again. Was only ($50) but he just kinda threw away our 6 year friendship over some stupid petty shit. As you might be able to tell, he was in the deeper stages of addiction. Third year of college comes and one of my coworkers brings up roxy, talks about how he has a connect and he loves them. I threw college parties often and he was kinda nerdy so I would always invite him to them, he would always ask if I wanted to get roxy with him and I said yes. This is where my first ever trips to go to a dealer would begin. They‚Äôre $$30 a piece..fuckk but ok buying 2 cya later. This small but consistent dosage of 2 a week would just increase maybe to 4 a week. Idk how but I told my mom I had this roxy connect( I didn‚Äôt have him directly I had to hit up my coworker who always made me front him) I didn‚Äôt mind fronting him, I liked him, he helped me out, and he always paid back on time. This connect had roxy all the time, and I have no idea how but I never had to worry about fakes with him either. He was 24 white male. I started picking up more like 15, most were for my mom who at the time had ‚Äúback pain‚Äù and back surgery so I felt like I was helping her out. And she loved me!! Of course she did right. My coworker one night gets arrested for possession of heroin. What I think he was doing was getting me to front him, he would get me pills and use his money on dope. Anyway, he gave me the connects number and the connect saw me enough to the point he was cool meeting me alone. I started slowly spending every dollar ever on them, and my mom too. My mom has a very upstanding career as well as my dad, but we were quickly spending a combined $1000 a pickup. When I started running out of money my mom would say you going to see him? ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt have money for them, but if you get me 2 I‚Äôll go‚Äù (I said 2 because this was kind of a hassle, the guy lived like 45mins-1hr away depending on traffic. My mom gave me 2 every time and that year I got the best grades I ever got. Going into ever night class every day of the week, snorted 60mg of roxy before every class and got As and Bs, first time ever in college(before I partied hard and smoked weed all the time and never went to class) but I somehow learned like a champ bc I was totally ok getting high at school and learning. Whatever it worked. I get a gf, and she‚Äôs so straight edge, never seen pot before yada yada does good in school nerd type girl. I really loved her, but kept my love for roxy a secret. Only my friends knew but all of us hanging out she started to hear stories of me snorting pills and crazy shit happening. One dAy she wanted to try some. She was TINY. 5 foot, maybe 90 pounds. I was hesitant on letting her try it  bc I was starting to learn the bad path it could lead you on. I let her know that these aren‚Äôt a joke and they‚Äôre dangerous, like probably all of us, she took on the challenge. Oh yes, the beautiful drug relationship requiem of a dream shit began. As any normal human she loved it. Started buying some with me, she would stay a lot lower in dosage tho, maybe 15mg for her when at this point I was idling around 45-60mg. The good thing about pills is that they‚Äôre so expensive it kinda limits you out. My dosage never really went beyond 60mg bc they were so expensive and couldn‚Äôt afford a more expensive habit. My gf, my mom, and I are buying pills people. I‚Äôm keeping this dealer dude in fucking business. Paying across the board $30 a pill...

One day, hm dude doesn‚Äôt answer me. Again no answer later on in the day, next thing you know, I am experiencing withdraw for the first time. Wow this is actually ass haha. Come to find out dude got arrested, and the guy who he was with narc‚Äôd on him. He gets out like in 7 days, hits me up immediately. I‚Äôm his money maker yanno. Boom, like clockwork we get this train rolling again. Maybe a few months go buy, life‚Äôs great, my mom, gf, and I are all high and happy, we‚Äôre both getting good grades, working making money...the good life. 

Again, one day no answer from dudey. Immediately I‚Äôm like ugh not again, and yes it was again. He gets arrested and I would never talk to him again even still. I only found out bc I searched and found him in the jails database. I am curious whatever happened to him and where he‚Äôs at. I no longer have a connect, withdrawals again, lil rough patch no big deal.

How fast did you guys break your new years resolution haha 

So last night a couple close friends and I had a get to gether to end the year off with good times.
Having a few beers, plenty of whiskey sours and enough bud to go around, we had a blast. Singing punk and folk songs around the camp fire, conversation filling the air. 

Starting to get a bit drunk, I decited to ask my friend if she could get me a 100mg Morphine. 
She hosted the party, and I know her mom has the motherload of medicine cabinets. 
Iv barked up this tree for years and its almost a joke now. As usual she doent comply lol

Being a bit drunk and confident, i took it upon my self to ask her mom. 
Im really close to the family and felt i could do it with out much repercussions. 

At first she was a bit shocked I even knew she had any opiates to begin with. But after a bit of sweet talking a making a shit load of popcorn she said ""ill see you inna sec"" and sent me on my way.

Out side for about 5 minutes, her mom comes out and stands away from everyone by the table. I get up and proceed to throw away my beer. 
""Come inside"" she whispered. 
I followed her into the kitchen and she explained ""I dont want to give you a 100mg because they are too strong, but I have this 30mg roxi and 30mg ir morph"" I couldint thank her enough. I offerd to pay, but she laughed and said to just wash her car...Fuckin DEAL! 

I get home and the drunk is wearing off as im preping both the roxi and morphine for IV. 
Iv never iv'd morphine but always wanted to. (I always plug) and dont think oxycodone is all that great iv unless you have alot imho. 

I figured this combo would be great since I love it so much with other ROAs
As soon as im swabbing my injection site my roomate comes home. 
Hes a opiphile aswell but doesnt iv, soo im lowkey about it. 
He brings home a half grizzy of blow. So i hold off on the nodd to enjoy some slopes with him;)

Today i wake up with a preloaded rigg 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morph. :):):)
I wake up with a ear to ear grin. 
Make coffe, take shower, play some vidya and call family. Now im ready...

Swabb site. And were off to the races. 
I push slow and steady and by time im half way through i start to feel eye pressure.
Befor i pull out the needle the pins and needles flood the lower half of my body and my legs are melting. 
Wow..... Just.. Wow
Iv never experienced a sensation like this. 
I have iv'd dilaudid and that was all a head rush with no legs. 

This, this was a new beast. 
Slowly the oxy began to take effect giving a pleasent euphoria to add but the morphine really stole the show. Great combo i might add. 

I melt in my seat, take a rip out the bole, spark a cigg and feel the eye pressure take over to a semi nodd state. 
Im in heaven. But do not take it for granted, i bask in the opiate soaked blanket that was once my skin.... Beautiful just beautiful. 

Though my tolerance was super low, and i could have enjoyed a bit stronger of a dose. All in all I enjoyed the hell out of it. Probably exactly the dose i needed since i had family dinner a few hours after and didint want to be all doped out...



Thanking the opiate gods for blessing me with this gift. These only come around so often... So thank you. 

Peace...

I got clean one year and two months ago. I was laying on a mattress in my living room, just staring at the wall and fucking hating myself. I did a massive line of dope and realized that self-loathing never went away...it was just was hiding under an opiate haze. I had an absolute moment of clarity and realized that I was going to die if I kept going--I checked myself into rehab the next day and never looked back.

My only real point is this: Being clean actually stops fucking sucking. It was really hard for the first few months...if for no other reason than having to re-remember how to be person and talk to people about things that weren't horror stories and really fucked up drug jokes. Having feelings again was super awkward; I honestly stumbled through a period of time where I felt like a robot learning to act human. I met some great people and some terrible ones. *But* my brain settled down and it didn't feel so weird anymore. I don't think about wanting heroin at all. I have a great job, an apartment, a boyfriend and I can actually afford nice things when I want them.

I'm not here to brag, or to tell you you should get clean--do your drugs if that's what you want to do--but if you want to quit and feel like you can't, I'm here to tell you that it's totally possible. It's a new year, people are making some bullshit resolutions...but it wouldn't be the worst to follow through with getting off your DOC this year, if you feel like it's eating away at you.

And if you're going to keep getting high, FFS get some Narcan and be smart about it. I've lost *so* many good people over the past few years and this subreddit has lost even more. Nod as safely as you can and stay on this Earth longer.

So basically I'm an IV heroin and coke addict who's been in and out of recovery for the last few years. I recently got kicked out of a halfway house and cut off from my Suboxone doctor, so I thought hey I'll just take bottles of immodium until I can get back on subs in my new area to stave off my withdrawals. Well, I basically became addicted to loperomide, and I was taking about 150 of them a day, constantly fucked up from them, never got back on my sub dose, and eventually started using heroin heroin again on top of the lope. So all of this has been going on in the last few months, and between the anxiety, the lope, and heroin and cocaine I realized that I hadn't shit in AT LEAST 10 days. I couldn't even remember when the last time I shit was, but normally I'd give myself  enough time each morning to shit  before I took all my drugs for the the day but with a lot on my mind recently it  just slipped from my thoughts. Well I realized this and freaked out, started reading about bowel compaction and getting even more scared. So I told myself I wouldn't take any opiates until I got this shit out, waited a day, nothing, day 2 nothing and the anxiety is really getting up there, plus I can't eat or drink anything without throwing it back up almost immediately. Day three which was yesterday, I spent literally the whole day sitting on the toilet trying to force myself to go, and nothing. I drank a whole damn bottle of milk of magnesia, and even gave myself a fucking enema with no luck. So basically last night I said if I couldn't shit by the morning I was gonna get gloves and pull that shit out with my hand, and by this time I was three days into full blow withdrawals with piles of opiates sitting in my drawer calling my name, but I stuck to my word, and FINALLY early this morning after three entire sleepless days of withdrawals, and spending my whole New Years completely alone and freaking out I got up and sat on my toilette and over the course of an hour and a half gave birth to what had to be at least 6 pounds of shit. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life, that even dopesickness couldn't chock itself up to, but I didn't care because the amount of relief I felt after that was practically enlightening. And on top of that I had myself a nice little 3 day tolerance break, and you can bet your ass that I ran straight to my stash and banged, sniffed and smoked everything I could immediately after I took that shit, and cried from the euphoria of it all. Anyway this was my first post and I read through the rules but let me know if I did anything wrong. Hope y'all had a better New Year's Eve than me but I guess I'll spend today getting fucked up in celebration instead. ",1514823213.0

So I've tried Sub Maintenance a few times and each and every time I always take more than I'm prescribed and each month I tell myself that ""this month will be different"" because running out like even three days short is just miserable but I'm not sure if their is much of a tolerance potential on subs but some days I just don't feel ""right"" and I end up taking more than I should. Also note I don't have anyone close to me that I would trust with holding my script and even then  I think I would just feel more shitty more often. I don't know but if anyone has any input on this or any experience? Does anyone on Sub Maintenance take it exactly as prescribed?

Social assistance didn't pay what they said they would over the phone. I have 600 dollars to my name.. and without a home address my PO sends me to jail. No other options for housing. I got an amazing offer on some cheap dope to start hustling.. it might be back to the life for me. I'm relishing these last 2 days before I'm stuck in the cold (Canada) on the run trying to make ends meet. I dont know if im ready to go through that hell again. I dont know if i can relive that hell again. Ive been debating getting a week of carries of methadone mixing with 10 or 20 xannys  and hoping thats enough to make me OD. I'm not afraid to OD anymore. Its happened 7 tines. Calmest way to die. I cant take the stress and unknowns anymore. I hope everyone else's 2018 is treating them better so far. Mine bent me over. Sorry for the rant i didn't know where else to post this. Thank you to this sub for at least occasionally putting a smile on my face during dark times.

Raids and heavy crackdowns in the area have made getting our usual favorite dope a pretty big hassle. Yesterday we ended up with shit that was half assed packaged and wasn't up to the normal standard. Today we hit up his makn dude and he had us come a bit further than where we usually go to him. We also had to wait a bit in a shit part of the city. He had the same stuff as yesterday which at first was disappointing but then he surprised us by handing over not 5 but 16 bundles. He explained this is what's currently going around and while he'd normally not hook us up to that extent, we'd now be getting more for our money as these bundles are less potent and have less in them than the standard. So even with that in mind , him giving us 16 instead of 5 more than made up for the drop in quality and quantity.

I held my boyfriends glock while he was at work. I googled & found how to aim for your brain stem. Then I suddenly decided to take a nap.,"I searched and found that like idk something like 5% end up mentally retarded and vegetative instead of dead. So I made sure I knew where to aim and where to put the gun in your mouth to hit your brain stem. I fixed a noose again that I had made earlier this summer after I got out of rehab, out of an exercise band. I tied it around my neck and figured if I shot myself and didn‚Äôt die, I‚Äôd at least be unconscious enough to still hang myself. I had the gun cocked and in my mouth. 

Then I suddenly got really tired. I had spent the last 7 or so months with no job after a shitty experience making me hate what I love best. I felt like a waste of heroin money sucking life. I figured I was better off dead to everyone than the burden I can be on and finding drugs. I thought it would make my boyfriend of 5 years less stressed. He calls me from work to make sure I‚Äôm not dead, a lot of times. 

I woke up to a phone call from a man I‚Äôve been stopping in to see since April. I went to him for a job. He came looking for me... physically drove to my boyfriends workplace to ask if I‚Äôd work for him... bc I was so depressed I wouldn‚Äôt answer my phone. I ended up going away to a 40 day rehab and missing my opportunity. I felt worthless, coming home sober and jobless. I relapsed a few weeks later. So I get this call, it‚Äôs John. He needs someone to fill in tomorrow. Can I come? It was seriously like one of those moments where you don‚Äôt know what to do but just sob.

I got on methadone the following week. I haven‚Äôt held a gun or exercise band in my hand since. My boyfriend hasn‚Äôt found paintings of nooses in my sketchbook. I hope 2018 can look 2017 in the eye and say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù.

I am coming up on a BENZO ONLY induced euphoria.,"I know this isnt the benzo sub but im active here and know many of you dabble.

So I used the last of my opiates last night, and given my abundance of benzos (no massive tolerance but been using them the last 10 days or so), I thought I would give a bit of a cocktail a go.


T - 2 hours: 20mg omeprazole (inhibits CYP3A4, enzyme that breaks down many benzos, and also great with morphine, tramadol and codeine)


T - 1 hour: 200mg cimetidine (another CYP3A4 inhibitor but also inhibits CYP2D6 so dont use this one with your opiates)


T - 30 minutes: Two double expressos.


T = 0: 200mg Tetrazepam (a rarer, weakish benzo lacking hypnotic properties but has some anxiolytic and significant muscle relaxant action)


T + 10 minutes: 0.5mg alprazolam (xanax)


T + 15 minutes: 6mg Bromazepam (The god benzo) **and** 1.25mg lorazepam.


T + 30 Minutes: Climbing body warmth and everything feels cozy, significant anxiolysis, **cognitive euphoria** (that fuzzy, penetrating euphoria you get in like the basal center of your head, which I associate strongly with opiates, not quite as wholesome but its there).

Will be sublingualling 3mg bromazepam at the predicted peak and sipping on a half shot of rum+ iced tea. Will update.

*EDIT: T + 1 hour: 3mg Bromazepam + 0.5mg alprazolam sublingual.*

*T + 1.5 hours: wow I'm feeling as good if not better than 40mg of plugged morphine (low/mild tolerance).*",1514926865.0

I'm in Day 3 (more like 3.5) of withdrawal, and I'm hurting. Mentally a wreck. In 10 days I have a refill. And I'm debating going on this week and asking for an increase in dose, potentially fucking the whole thing up.

Do I risk it? Or just suffer through. 10 days seems like a fucking eternity. I'll get a bunch then.

I know the answer. Kratom is helping. Kpins too. Sleep is easy. Xanax is great for that.

When will the withdrawals stop so I can just be ok waiting a few days?

Also, question 2. I've gone to same doctor for 2 years. Never asked for an increase. Always same dose. I am on these meds long term. Could I have an honest talk and ask for a small increase? Explain that tolerance after 2 years has taken a toll and the pain is building. I take 3x10 a day. Would asking for 4, after never asking, never missing a pee test etc, set off any red flags?

Thanks community. Just need a little help. Had to step out to my car, had a little emotional breakdown. 

TLDR - just tell me that time is gonna go quick. And is asking for a small bump in dosage after 2 years a bad thing?

So I have been using off and on for about 8 or 9 years. I have gotten clean several times, the longest being a 2-3 year stretch. This last go round I had been using opium for about 2 years before switching back to H (my DOC). I have been on the H again since September, so about 3 months now.




Here's the odd bit. I've been going through 1 g of pretty decent #4 H every 2-3 days. I have been trying to cut back so I have been doing *slighhhtttly*, and I mean just slightly smaller shots. When I do these shots I will get the rush and the nods, but the euphoria is lacking and immediatly following the rush I get a wave a of anxiety and depression that lasts about 15 min. After it fades it's business as usual. It doesn't happen when I take a proper sized shot.  This kind of thing has never happened and seems quite odd. Anyone else have experience with this?

Holy fuck. I took a lot more than 100mg and ended up nodding out for about 3 hours and having a harsh comedown due to its short duration. Be careful.",1514917164.0

I still look forward to sharing past tales about Cliff but I do not want to forge any new experiences. Last year I learned how is easy it was to get burned. I've come out of this year having better protected my interests but there is folly in hanging out someone like Cliff. I shouldn't have to always be on high alert when doing business with a ""friend"" in order to ensure he doesn't get one-up on me. I'd be so much better off if I just cut Cliff out of my life like so many suggest upon reading my tales.

&nbsp;

On odd weeks Cliff gets a benzo script. His hustle is to trade them up for dope. It seldom works out and in the past I used to pick up his benzo script from the pharmacy. One time he said ""would you pick it up if there was a good chance you'd have something before work?"" At the time I was nearly dope-sick so I was like hell yeah... Instead in that scenario Cliff consumed a bunch of benzos, was in and out of consciousness and mumbled through any conversations.


Most recently, I covered my ass. Bought subs and did not go through Cliff to get them because he's super unreliable for that. He did offer to get subs and I told him that's great, and that I would be happy to give him the money the minute I saw those subs in front of my face. He stopped mentining that sub connect a day later and re-focused on his hustle to get dope.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I was off from work but told Cliff I was working because I didn't want him calling my house phone or kocking on my door. He eventually texted ""text me back asap"" but none of his messages indicated why he was messaging me. Maybe I'd jump if there was a guarantee that he would give me some money he owes me but in all likelyhood he'd ask me to bike to the ATM to get his money because he's fat and lazy. 


Bottom line, I'm to run errands for him when it's 15 degrees outside. Plus there is a codependency thing going on here and it needs to be broken. I've taken steps in the right direction because I was sick of going into withdrawal. We all know that counting on Cliff's word to stay well often ends in me writing sad tales.

&nbsp;

Can I just keep avoiding him? Probably not and will have to confront him soon. I left an old MacBook at his house, I'd like to maintain pretenses long enough to get that back so for these days where I avoid him... perhaps I'll just make up a story like he usually does. ""I was sick"" or ""some bullshit came up""... 


I dunno.. I'm just glad I took steps to keep myself well and held on to my cash for my own purposes as it should be. Worst case hte old.

&nbsp;

In the future I'll maintain a ratio of non-cliffposts to cliffposts.",1514915344.0

Recently i've got access to buy few 200mg MST Continus (3 of them) for ~35 dollars.  
My tolerance is low - 240-390mg of codeine(to get pretty nice high) and i've never tried any other opiate.
oral bioavailability of morphine is around 25-30% (as i know) so hwow much i need to take to feel.. you know, great?
i could sniff that, but not sure if it's possible with these pills, and IV isnt for me, yet.  
so questions are:
- is it worth the price compared to 3$ for 150mg of codeine?
- how to dose it with my low tolerance, to get this opiate happiness that a lot of people are talking abouut?
- oral or sniff?
I wrote this on high so sorry for mistakes if there are, have a nice dayyy!

I have a history of heavy use, including fent. but that was a couple years ago, just been chipping off various things since. Iv also wondered how quickly your body metabolizes Fent, and how much builds up in your system at any given point. (For example, if my body moves through it at a rate which allows 4 hours of the drug to build up, I would have 44mcg active in my system during the duration of the patch.)

any advice for how to use one of these guys safely? Iv gotten quite lucky with past fent use, and I fucking love the stuff, and I know that this is the smallest dosage available, but im still not trying to fuck around with something im not prepared for and end up dead.
