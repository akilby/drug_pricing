For as long as I can remember, my dad was addicted to heroin.. All kinds of different opiates and other drugs, really. My first clear memory of his use was when I was around 6 and he was nodding out at the wheel of the car while driving with me, my brother and mom. We almost all died, my mom kicked him out of the car and next thing I know, ""papa's going on a trip out west to visit a friend""... I heard this story countless time and obviously it was code for rehab. I grew up with this horrible stereotype against people who used opiates or shot up, saying that would never be me, why would I do the same thing that tore apart my family?

Last August, my dad shot his girlfriend then committed suicide. This happened in the nursing home his girlfriend was in, she had just suffered a stroke and half of her body was paralyzed. It was all over the news and the city shut down a portion of the street the home was on.. I was 2 years into my own opiate habit and hadn't talked to him for 8 months prior. I was devastated and still am.

Today I'm 50 days clean which may not be a lot, but it's the most in almost 3 and a half years. I've been thinking about him a lot and regretting not talking to him. I kept my addiction from him even though he knew better than anyone what I'd be going through. Our relationship was always a roller coaster as most are when there's addiction involved. But I feel like a really fucked up person, a hypocrite, a failed daughter.

I just finished moving and found a box of letters he wrote me over the years while in inpatient, IOP, multiple rehabs over the states, etc. That shit hit me hard because they were almost the same thoughts I've had over and over but reading them while struggling myself was a hard dose of reality.

Fuck I'm sorry this is so long I didn't think I had that much to say. Guess I wanted to vent and also see if anyone has gone through something similar or dealt with your own addiction while a parent is doing the same..",1420078951.0

It truly has changed my life for the better in so many ways, which irritates me when I hear of people denouncing it's use in long-term scenarios.  As of right now, I have no urge to get off the medicine in the near future as it keeps me level and does a fantastic job of eliminating cravings - something that I assume most people take for granted as I know I do.  It is difficult to remember how bad life was when using opiates regularly in the physical and mental aspect of it due to being baseline on bupe for so long.

The only time I will get a craving is when I browse this sub or opiophile for a very long time, so I literally forget how bad it would be mentally if I were not on bupe.  Anybody else been on bupe for years, or have plans to stay on it for more years?  As of now, I really consider myself to be a long-term bupe user.  I won't say I am a lifer, but if I need to stay on bupe until then I really do not see any negative aspects of it.

I have been prescribed anywhere from 2-24 mg and am currently on 16, but I keep it to around 4mg daily, possibly 8 if I want to get a glow, which is still possible.  I used to IV it for years which satisfied my needle fixation, but have discontinued that trend due to the damage that 7 years of IV use has had on my veins.  I don't agree that it's more damaging to veins than anything else, as I rotated 3-4 spots for years without noticing collapsed veins.  However, I have seen a vein collapse right in front of me when IVing the old orange Suboxone which was something I had never encountered.  Right now I am on generic Subutex and there is definitely no difference between Subutex/Suboxone, although I have seen people in real life and on the internet swear that Tex is better which is so much of a placebo effect that I have stopped arguing with people about it.

Long-term bupe patients, share your stories!

EDIT - I forgot to add that the only negative side effect I still experience is nausea.  No matter how high my tolerance is, bupe still gives me slight nausea throughout the day, although I have never vomited.  I used to be prescribed promethazine for it, which potentiated the bupe very nicely, but my doctor has switched me to Zofran, which is excellent at keeping the nausea at bay but doesn't potentiate like promethazine does.  My daily routine is dosing 600-1000mg of Tagamet, 75-100mg of Benedryl and my scripted 20mg Adderall before taking bupe.  It synergizes well with the Adderall and is nice to level out the extra stimulation.  Lunesta before bed rounds out my daily intake, though sometimes taking it during the day gives me that benzo-relaxation and makes the bupe stronger for sure.  I used to research etizolam and flubromazepam, but 100-200mg of those a day for a year definitely fucked up a lot of things, especially grades in school, so I would recommend a Z-drug to those in the same boat as they are easier to obtain and do not carry the same stigma.",1420058530.0

#2) is there any other reason one's pupils would be constricted all the time? I've heard of miosis but I know it's not that common. I work with someone from Philly who is young like myself and always has the smallest pupils. It's really odd and often distracting. I guess what I'm asking is, would that be enough to convince you of opiate abuse or, simply give you a suspicion?

For the past year I've been isolating myself, not hanging out with or talking to anyone, not going out, feeling awful and depressed. 

My friend who lives near me is a really close friend, like my platonic soulmate. We've known each other for 20 years and will tell each other things that we'd never breathe a word of to anyone else. Both of us are pretty fucked in the head, and it's not unusual for us to go months inseparable and then for no reason stop hanging out or talking for several more months. 

Anyway lately I've thought I've been fine with my lack of friends. The way I've felt lately is just too hard to cover up and I no longer have the energy to fake it anymore. Hence the isolation. 

Anyway this guy, Kris, just randomly calls me at 2:30am on New Years Day. He tells me that he's coming to pick me up and take me back to his place. I was a bit skeptical, not sure that I could deal with interaction, but I am so glad I went. This kid requires no effort on my part to hang out with, and he gets me. I told him stuff and opened up to him in a way that I didn't think was possible for me. I can't believe that I'd forgotten what a comfortable social interaction is. For the first time in at least a year, I was actually happy and felt really lucky to have someone in my life. It really made me feel so much more human, and talking to him about my issues made me feel like I might actually be able to fix them. 

So we just hung out and snuggled platonically and drank booze, and he gave me a a bunch of Ritalin, some klonopin (which I fucking love) and a suboxone he randomly had laying around! All for free, just for the hell of it!

It's nice to realize that I still have some humanity left after this horrible year. 

And my dank poppy seeds are arriving today, although yesterday morning I took the suboxone, which was stupid but I didn't even think about it. It was a full 8mgs 24hrs ago. You guys think I should wait on making tea? I would really hate to wait but it would suck to waste it. 

Thanks for reading. I mainly just wanted to share the one positive thing that's happened to me in a really long time. Hang on to your friends, they can make everything better when you've otherwise lost hope.

I've been battling intranasal heroin addiction for a couple years, was clean for nearly 2 thanks to suboxone maintenance 4-8mg a day, but fell off the wagon two and half months ago where I used everyday... basically was a big binge, my parents noticed something was off, I confessed and was very open to them. It breaks my heart to put them through the worries/stress about me. I'm going through more therapy now, now seeing a drug-counselor (not probation-wise... for my parents relief) where I gotta pee in a cup every week.... and I dont mind that too much because I'm using heroin under their roof and I should respect their decisions... they want the best for me and so do I.

I feel horrible, I haven't been taking my prescribed suboxone doses to deter me from relapse (hell I take like 3mg most these days) and the reason why is cause I still haven't found the willpower to get off the ride... I still love heroin and it's one evil tempting mistress. 

Today... a buddy hit me up and this time I caved in... got three fire stamps and got super high and feel great but still... the guilt... I have a drug test next week and I'm hoping the heroin will be out of my system by then (if anyone knows this please let me know) and i will only test positive for the buprenorphine... I guess this drug testing weekly will at least FORCE me to chip instead of binge.. but man I want to get off the ride but I just cant. I'm weak mentally you can say, but I just can't refuse that lovely feeling. Why can't there be a version of heroin without all the negative bullshit, the pain you cause your family, the stigma, the lifestyle, the lies, the hiding, the everything...

Sometimes I wish my life were fucked up somehow so I could point to something and say *that* is why I'm unhappy :-(",1420168775.0

Among my crowd, I'm an anomaly. My friends all turn on the television, sometimes music, and just melt into the couch. As soon as I consume (DOC: roxy 30s up the nose & h when it's around, also up the nose) my brain wakes up and is suddenly ready to go. My friends call me ""The Journalist"" when I'm high because I ask so many questions and have a keen interest in the world. We argue whether my being intoxicated stops my curiosity from being genuine. 

Anyway...that's my general attitude, but in solitude, what I like to do alone is to drink cheap red wine out of a coffee mug, open up a book of extremely difficult crossword puzzles and spend the entire night solving it. If I'm stuck, I'll research the context of a clue (avoiding putting the clue verbatim into Google) until I discover the answer (discover it, not shown it). All the while, I have Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Townes Van Zandt, or another musician of the same ilk...skilled guitar, thought-provoking lyrics, acoustic. After I'm exhausted with the crossword puzzle I'll pick up the guitar myself. The only time I can learn a song by ear is while under the influence of any dwnr--from mild hydros to fire h. Don't know why; likely just the patience. I do this maybe 3 times a week--10-12 blues and one box of wine per week...about 3-4 blues a night and about the equivalent to a bottle and a half of wine a night. 

This is comfortable for me, and I hope it can last. I kicked a 2 bun a day habit and wanted to find a way to have this shit in my life in a controlled manner. I've been told it's impossible, and I don't doubt that, but I've been on the schedule described above for 2 months now after 6 months clean. 

I guess I got off topic, but I'm curious to hear how people spend their time once the rush settles. More dazers, or does this stuff seem to excited the brain for some people? ALSO, any thoughts, criticisms, stories, etc. about my plan to stay on this current schedule are very welcome.

I was in college and had everything I needed but  fucked around and got a drug charge and it was over in my 3rd year.

I have felt shitty watching my friends go on to get nice jobs and cars while I live at home, work at restaurants, and struggle with an addiction that seems to feed on my depression from not graduating (fucked up cycle? Yes, it would seem so)

For some reason I listened to my ghetto fucking probation officer who said ""Nuh-uh boy! You got a drug charge? No more financial aid! You fucked it all up!"" What a fucking bitch. Hearing that killed me. I'm not strong or athletic, i'm only intelligent. I neeeed a degree. Construction companies don't want me, and i'm not going pro at any sport anytime soon. 

I needed to find out for myself. I wouldn't receive judgement from a god damned probation officer. I decided to read up on this myself only to learn that I will in fact be eligible for financial aid again this year. Hell yeah! thats a fucking weight off my shoulders. I got charged November 2013 and just didn't sign up for class in january because a friend of mine signed up and learned that during re-enrollment is when they usually pull all police reports on students. he had some crazy shit and got instantly expelled the first week of class. 

My charge warrants a one semester suspension so i'm gonna sign up for class and take my suspension. This is so that I will have fulfilled all requirements of my charge. I have done everything from a legal standpoint but I haven't even talked to student conduct about what happened. If this works I should e able to request my transcript this summer. This is vital because I completed 3 years with decent grades and since i'm taking financial aid I want to finish my degree in 2 years or less to minimize debt. 

I have had NOTHING to look forward to for the longest time but now I feel like I can get back on track if I work hard enough! After fucking the first go round my parents are done paying for school. So financial aid is the only way I will get to finish my last 1-2 years of college. 

I know college is a scam or whatever but I've never been happier than when I was in college. I experiences a complete mental rebirth, gained confidence, had a bunch of friends, a few girlfriends, and life was just great. The epitome of youth, ya know? When I lay around all day waiting for work or waiting for the dope I often think...man...this not how things should be. Not for me.

 This may be the key to me really staying away from the boy: really having a long term goal. I know things may not work out like I think they will but i'm gonna try anyways because if it does work out...i'll be.........elated. ",1420167293.0

So I got a new girl kinda that I've been talking to. My co workers cousin and we gotta keep it on the low because she's got a bf and it's her boss and shit. But we still do our thing. 

The first night we hooked up. She bagged me actually using pretty much strictly emojis. Mind as well give the whole story... It's a long one but kinda worth the read. 

Soooo. This kid I worked with, his cousin would come to work every once in a while to clean her car. I work at a car detailing place. So I quickly realized everyone was on her dick hard. I didn't really know her story yet. One kid has a sex charge (got beer for a girl who was like 15 she didn't have cash so she offered to suck his dick, he accepted, she told the whole school and it got back to admins, admins went to police.) he isn't a bad dude though, but he's really into this chick, we'll call her Lisa. Which is absolutely not her name lol. But anyway. This kid with the sex charge, this other kid joe who is kind of a tool but whatever, were both on her dick hard. So I ignored her just assuming she was loving the attention so I didn't want to give her anymore. Anyway. ""Lisa's"" cousin the sex charge kid and I used to go grab a couple beers at duffs a local chicken wing spot and Lisa was at work one day washing her car. I had worked there now about 3 months and I got this girls story. She is 21 (im24) dating her boss who's 39, but hasn't had sex in like 30 some odd days, she was keeping track not me. So she doesn't want to break up w him because she'll lose her job and all This shit so this is what I know of her. She smokes mad weed which is something I dont, I just shoot dope. Strictly shoot dope. So she knows that I have been to prison and thinks that im clean and shit but that's besides the point. I don't really go too hard with it I just maintain. But by now she knows my history and knows that I used to get high and robbed a gas station and this shit. We have had short discussions but I still don't pay her much attention when she's there because the sex charge kid is in love w her and I don't want to step on toes. Obviously these kids have known her longer than me and have got no where I don't want to waste my time. 

So one night me, sex charge, and her cousin are talking about heading to Duff's to get some beers and shit after work while Lisa is there doing her car. She says she wants to go which is weird because she's never shown any interest in going out before. So I say I don't care ask your cousin. He says sure. I don't even have her number yet so as I walked by she handed me her phone. I said what, I have one already I'm good thanks. She said no put your number in it. I'm a sarcastic prick, but she understood the joke. I put my number in it and texted myself so I had her number. That was all the convo at this point and I thought nothing of it. 

So we get the duffs. She's in her vehicle I'm in mine sex charge and her cousin catch a ride together. We go in and have a couple drinks. After about an hour I get a text from her, she's sitting across from me and the convo starts...

She sends me a ;) in which I respond with a smiley face emoji she sends a thumbs up and I send a pointy finger to the right with the ""ok"" hand signal like a dick going into a vagina with your hands kinda you know? Anyway. She sends back a clapping hands I send back some stupid hands next to each other making like wings or something To keep the emoji game going. She sends lips so I know it's getting pretty serious. I send thumbs up and a guy kissing a girl she sends back ""whennnnn"" I send back ""don't start"" because I think she's bull shitting. She sends back pahaaaaaa hahaaa. Furthermore making me think she is bluffin with her muffin. I said ""yea exactly"" she said ""come onnnn"". So I think she may be a little serious now. But idk yet. I sent back, back to your crib? Ok done deal. She said oh no find somewhere else. I said I have an apartment in south buffalo, leggo. She said kinda far. I said your car (because she's got an suv) have sex charge drive your cousin home. She said ok where should we park. I said, this parking lot cvs parking lot I'm not picky. You know the area better than me so it's up to you. End of convo. 

So we finish our drinks and they smoke a bowl the 3 of them and they leave. I am now panicking realizing that I have. It had a shot in almost 12 hours so my dope dick is going to be ineffective. And I haven't had sex off heroin in who the fuck knows how long. So this is going to be one of those times where you nut in about four pumps. Idc I have no shame. This is what happens to me when I go a month at least without nutting. So I'm sitting in my car while they are smoking this bowl and it's really setting in that im about to look like a retard. I have no rinses left or even rigs if I did have a rinse or something to do. So they leave and I pull up next to her and shit and Hop in her truck. It's kinda awkward considering we have had no real long conversations and we are about to engage in intercourse for, what I expect at least, is about to be about 40 seconds with the few pumps with real boner and then the rest with my chub until that discipates too. So I ask where we should go and she suggests a skate park but it's snowing out but i don't care. I just want to get it in. I make out with her a littleJust to break the ice and set the mood a bit and we pull off to go to the apartment complex next to the skatepark. We both realize it's way too cold to go to fuck outside of her very warm vehicle. So we figure the back seat is the best move at this point. 

I get out of the car and go to her back seat on the driver side because the passenger side doesnt open. So she hops in the back from the front seat and she's taking her pants off (get ready kids, it's about to get durrrty) and I take off my shoes because I'm going to be needing to get some leverage. So I know that I am going to bust quickly so I know my only play is to get as much foreplay in as possible before I hit her with the D. Her pants are obviously off so im just going to town eating this puss like its my last meal. I know my tongue game is on point though so it's not a big deal.  im still worried about my ween. After a few mins of this she's obviously super wet and I come up for a breath and she pulls me up to fuck her. It's game time. It's over pretty much before it starts. I know this. She doesn't. So pretty much as soon as its in and I am pumpin I get that feeling we all know so well. So I pull out to gather myself and it and I regain my composure. Head back in and after a few pumps its right back so I say fuck it pull out and nut on her floor. (She's got rubber mats it's ok) so I am back down on her and I say ""fuck you gotta be kidding me!"" She says ""what's wrong?"" Im like ""I just stepped in snow from when I took my shoes off and my boner went away!"" So she grabs it and starts treating it like its a fucking bop-it and the only thing the guy keeps saying is ""pull it!"". Her hand game isn't til good and mouth game (I know now) is non existent. I am not recovering from this anyway but she doesn't know this. But she hasn't had sex in over a month at this point. So I am going to town and I make her squirt all over her seat and it could have wrung out my hoodie sleeve. 

So we stop and its get dressed and get back into the front. She drives me back to my car. We have a little discussion and I kiss her goodnight. She texts me when she gets home saying she had a great night and she looks forward to doing it again. So I am like cool whatever. I don't hear from her for two days but I end up hearing from her and we talk a little and things are good. 

The next week we do almost the same and my dumb ass is Ill prepared again so my excuse this time is That my balls hit the cold seat. So she again starts with her broken bop-it games. And I continue to eat her out. Whatever it works. So a few more times this has happened. And it SUCKS the times i don't have a shot we fuck and when I have a bundle she doesn't want to or we don't hang out. So that happened about 6 times but I finally planned a little better and hit her with the dope dick and fucked her for an hour and a half before we had to go to Her sisters. So it was a proud moment for me. 

Anyone else have this problem with a new girl though? It's super embarassing and I can't tell her really why I am nutting so fast. Plus I have just not had enough time away from heroin to really get some real stamina down. It suuucks.

Ahhhhhh Bella Donna. Why can't we just go back to your apt back here. Come back to buffalo. ",1420159911.0

I like to see results, find things out for myself, draw my own conclusions, etc. I'm sure a lot of you are the same way. 

Sometimes however, I think a lot about philosophy, history, religion, and stuff like that. Humanities I guess. 

Lately i've been thinking about us humans. And how terrible we are to one another. How greedy people are with wealth, how we don't introduce medicines to third world countries because they can't pay, how people starve....

Maybe i'm thinking this way because  I see all of these lofty and merry new years resolutions on facebook. But we all know, just like an acid trip, that the sense of changing oneself eventually fades. Why can't we change? Isn't that...fucked?

And so I've been thinking of the true evils of the world. What are they? Banks? Maybe I just think that because I never have money since I stopped dealing. Cops? Maybe I just think that because i'm a drug user. 

Well then, what is evil? Murder? But nature murders. What about corruption? Something that leads ones mind to see the false as true and the true as false. 

Heroin. 

I don't know what lead me to this thought, I haven't been clean for very long and I think of smoking weed constantly. I am not perfect enough to judge anything or anyone. 

But I will admit that I have thought long and hard about this. The evils of the world. And the number one contender is heroin. 

But, these are just my thoughts. What are yours? I also think religion is evil when used as a tool for personal gain. Corporations are pretty fucked up.

I don't know where I was going bc they merged from the on ramp (which is obviously after the exit) that I'd take to get to my house.

So anyway, we're all going down the road and I drift into the left lane and almost hit the biker. As I swerve back into my lane, I clipped the back tire of the chick biker gang members ""old lady"" (big no no). When we hit, she got speed wobbles a lil but saved it from wrecking. So I'm like,  ""FUCK"" and look behind me and about 3 cars back, a cop flips his lights on.

I get arrested because they found the dope I had on me and go to the local jail (which was weird because it was a statey that got me). They bunk me up wit this 15 y/o girl which also was weird because we all know they don't let the opposite sex bunk up.

All the sudden, she started getting reckless, so I'm yelling out the cell, ""yo get this bitch outta here before I catch another charge.""

They move her, I end up wit getting a guy celly and then I woke up. There was more after that, but it was dumb shit so it's not worth mentioning.

Now **here's where it gets really weird.** Usually when I do opiates, whether it's d or blues, I always wake up just as I'm falling asleep. It's constant broken sleep all night. So apparently, I picked my phone up at some point and texted my boy to let him know I was getting locked up, to call my lawyer, and go into the safe we share and bring bail money.

I don't remember texting him, not even in my dream! Lol. I wake up this morning and apparently he texted me back with:

Him: ""come on bruh. Not again. U need to chill. Wut jail?""

Him: ""yo""

Him: ""wut jail????""

I didn't respond til this morning to let him know I was dreaming lol.

My question to you's is, when you's are fucked up, do you ever do shit in the middle of your sleep that you don't remember doing? I can't tell you how many holes have been burned into blankets and how many times I've burned my fingers from lighting a cig in the middle of the night and having no idea I did it.

Maybe I should have just waited until tomorrow...but wow, I'm glad i didn't. I'm sure I can hold off and not touch my dope until later today, I'll take my weak morning shot in awhile but I refuse to mix up anything from my new bag until the day is over and I'm ready to sleep within a few hours. 

One of the guys -the one that thought i was a cop when he was drunk cause i had a blue hat and a blue jacket and headphones once when he was making deliveries..- from the crew i buy from told me to meet him at the ""eye doctor""

So I'm there for longer than the 15 minutes he said he'd be and a car pulls up. Door flings open, ""Mike Mike! Hey!! Mike??!!?""

No. ______, is my name, are you supposed to meet me... so they seem thrilled and i jump in, turns out we're not understanding each other and whereas i thought this was a new guy from the crew I was actually meeting some people from two towns over that came out here for FENT, they'd been smoking lots of it as of late and now they wanted lots, like $500 worth. 

So I ask my dealer and he and the girl who i am pretty sure is his boss is like my boyfriend has $60,000 legal fees already, fuck that we're not meeting new people. This goes on back and forth for awhile and I'll spare you the boring details but it gets to the point these virtual strangers are willing to hand me $500- and let me walk. They pushed and pushed to let one come, ""how about just the girl"" the chick kept saying...""how about just the girl"". NO.

I think they were mayyyybe on the verge of saying yes but they said no and then started getting really blunt and dismissive with me, as in no it's not going to happen, stop asking and hanging up on me. So as politiely as i can manage I call back asking about my measly $50 bag...and i know I should have just waited until tomorrow but here i am feeling upset so i ask, nope. 

So then I'm thinking this worker just wont see me all day and their shifts start at midnight and go all day. LAME. 

So the people i tried to help smoke a good deal of heroin with me and it made me appreciate the fact I'm not smoking a shit ton of fent like they are... supposedly they were on a binge and they ran out and had been smoking down. they offerred to sell me a little of their shit but it looked terrible and noticably cut, like i saw a bright fleck of something in there...not like shiny like good coke, i mean like the shit i scrape off the bottom of mushrooms after growing them...like some loose vermiculite fucking flakes. 

Whatever they were smoking with me was good tho.

They ask if I do any other drugs and start to pass around meth, at this point i just don't care..i don't really like stims much but i had a crappy New Years and remember what it was like to get spun and thought fuck it, I'll go home and finsh the deep clean i was doing on my house earlier. The shit hit me really, really hard after years of not touching it. i really wanted more and wish they would have smoked more with me, at first they were generous, then when i tried to hit the near empty pipe the girl took it away and told me it was pointless. 

I really do think meth is gross, and i don't think i should be doing it, but this makes me wonder what it would be like to pop some adderall once in awhile...clearly i don't completely hate stims.

So there's a guy in the back seat with me, a guy in the front and a fairly cute,fit girl driving. Clearly the guy in the front has been cheating on his girl with the driver. anyway...i show them our version of a ghetto and they ask some street people if they know of anyone who might be selling fent.

These folks seemed to use needles sometimes, they had a loose cooker, in fact the driver offered it to me and i declined ...a cooker that's been floating around the floor of your car?no thanks I'll pass but thanks. lol :D

But they wanted the fent cause they swore they smoke it, and they've been going thru ""hundereds of dollars on an epic binge"". Is that even really effective? smoking fent? idk. 

So when the guy in the backseat is talking to street people about where to buy drugs in the ghetto or if any street dealers are out-at fucking 3am...keep in mind it's fucking 3am in a small Canadian town, lololol... The driver is joking and flirting with the guy up front and the guy up front turns around and goes...(keep in mind we're all really, really high... from the speed, down, etc)

""Hey man, you into threesomes""
Earlier we had talked about my divorce, how i want to date a girl that's not white for once, and the contention of the guy up front that ""all red haired girls fucking stink...down there""

""I've never had one but I'd fucking love to, it's on my list of things i for sure want to try""

""But like two guys and a girl, it's not fucking gay or anything""

""Yeah man, that's totally hot, I really want to try that some time""
Now the driver girl is giggling and laughing.
""Yeah, as lon as our dicks don't touch bro, I could like high five you tho""
""Yeah dude, I'd be down, I want to try that some day""

Now I'm wondering if I'm going to hang with these people long enough, or if that's even an option, regardless I just had fun with the topic, we were all laughing about it and keeping it light but I'll admit the girl was hot and that would be one more thing on my bucket list checked off. 

We go to pick up their friend from McDicks, and she shoves me into the middleseat and has a melt down, she fucking flips, she's screaming ""you fucking assholes you left me there for 4 hours"" she screams about this for like 10 minutes straight and it totally changes the mood of the car..now I'm thinking it wont be long till I'm dropped off like i asked them earlier....before we decided to take a trip to the ghetto... and now I can't get dope until the shift change and the only thing I have to show for it is a free high and a new memory.

I was hoping that when they met this guy for their $500 of fent finally that maybe i could get my $50 of down and maybe, JUST FUCKING MAYBE..SINCE I BURNT MY OWN CHANCES FOR THESE PEOPLE AND FREAKED OUT MY DEALER MAYBE JUST FUCKING MAYBE I COULD MEET A NEW CONNECT IN MY TOWN, MAYBE EVEN A BETTER ONE, OR ONE THAT GIVES PRICE BREAKS WHEN YOU BUY A FEW GRAMS AT A TIME.

But I guess that wasn't meant to be. The driver asks me where to drop me off, and it seems the guy they spent 4-5 hours tracking down...the guy they drove from two towns over for ""only has a gram left""

IDK how much a gram of fent costs, how they can weigh it like that outside of pills and patches and shit and I didn't care. I asked them to call me if it goes well and maybe i can meet that guy,...in their defense i was unable to help them so i wasn't bothered when they didn't even tap my number into their phone, plus the girl they picked up was still loosing her shit...i quickly mentioned my number and went home. 

Called my guys, and they say ""you were with them all that time""
I explain that i was with them for a couple of hours and that they just got me realy high and cut me loose, and that i didn't mind walking to meet.

They did my fave thing but idk if it was the meth but i was worried....they went from saying...nothing is going on to ...""Wait, is this ______ ?
""We're going to come meet you right away, we'll phone when we're at your place, meet you at the side door""

I meet my friends at the side door of my building to sell weed and my dope dealers sometimes meet me at the side door but people in the background sounded aggressive and i worried i was going to get a punch in the head or something. 

I just ran something by them, DO YOU WANT $500, I CAN MEET YOU BY MYSELF I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO MEET NEW PEOPLE, i mean shit I thought they would be thrilled, ""you're bringing us $500?, fuck yeah!""

But they were too paranoid. 

My only hope now was to be really, really polite and hope to change their mind if they were planning on punching me. I'm a really good customer but I've only dealt with this new guy a few times and one of those times I met him and his drunk friend...seemed like they were drinking heavy and smoking crack while making deliveries...so when they saw me in my blue hat and blue jacket and ""headset"" aka headphones...they thought i was a cop. They even yelled at me, i didn't give them shit i just said why would you think that and got back ""you're on the fucking corner, just fucking standing there with your fucking blue hat and blue jacket and a fucking headset, like a fucking dork, looking like the po-po, so we fucking left!!OK!!!?""

They were all over the map that night and they got all sorts of complaints and since then this guy hasn't brought the same friend on runs anymore tho.

And so true to Canadian form they were polite and just said ""yeah that situation was weird, it wasn't worth the risk for us""

Fair enough. But there i was willing to help some strangers that got me high, and i was going to collect NO CASH FROM THE STRANGERS and Ask for nothing extra from my dealers...if it had gone thru i was THINKING ABOUT asking for an extra point for bringing them $500 worth of fucking cash from out of the fucking ether, which seemed pretty reasonable to me but idk...fuck me I guess. 

Anyway, I met a new short guy, i think he's the bf the girl was talking about, so maybe he's the boss-couple? idk. but this is my best connect until I find a good and regular deep web supplier. I'm hoping that by the end of the year I've tried a number of sources and i can time my orders so I always a nice -afforable- package in transit just as i run out. 

Always gotta have a local guy to tho, and I'm thankful they came out and that while they were a little rude when i called from the strangers cell when they saw my number again they were at my back door in less than 15 mintues. 

I really did want to double team that girl tho. especially after even the couple of fat hits of meth i had. I feel kinda gross. when friends of mine were into this shit i never really paid it much attention, and it has no real pull on me...but like coke if it's there i guess I'm not so strong.

I also don't think using it a couple of times a year is so bad, but i don't intend to buy it it use it again any time soon. 

I wanted to go on an adventure with these people tho..but knowing my luck I'd get stuck a few towns over with no ride home. and i don't know they social dynamic, once that chick they picked up lost her shit on them the mood quickly changed from a relaxed lets see where this goes to time to cut our losses.

IDK if they'll end up even buying the 1 gram of fent the guy has left or what... and frankly i don't care. The sad thing is at this point I just wish i would have taken more meth cause i could have gotten a few more solid pulls. if it's going to keep me up all night i might as well make it count. oh well. 

I'm not touching my dope until it's night time. this little $50 has to last for 3 days or until i sell a couple of nice bags of weed... if I'm broke in the coming week-pretty likely- I'm going to take a break with the help of lope, i know it's time as the same amount just isn't cutting it anymore and I'm not rich or cool enough to just keep upping my dose. 

I have this feeling like...if i could jussssttt stretch this .3 bag out as much as possible making shots that get weaker as i go i wont be sick and when the break happens and i enter the Province of Suckage and end up in the town of Soberville the transition will be easier. 

I know I need a break but I also don't want one, so if i need to have one I'm going to make the best of it and try-key word is try- to ride it out and make it count, not 2-3 days of no dope, like 1-2 weeks dope free. kinda hard when the moment I have even a measly $20 I can get dope in mere moments. 

tl; dr version
Went to pick up, met strangers, stuff happened...wanted to fuck the driver. 
Dang.

This is wrong, it will only result in even larger rock hard turds and can even cause a blockage, fiber bulks up stool and you don't want that in opiate induced constipation. 

Most medical pros recommend taking generic stool softeners daily instead.

My own personal regime is that if I am going to get off a maintenance dose and have a ""vacation"" where my dose is going to be higher I switch to a low residue diet for that time period and try to take some meals as liquid meal shakes and eat mostly protein. I try to reduce fiber as much as possible to decrease the amount of stool I will have to pass, and once I am back to a dose just used to maintain and constipation isn't so much of an issue I go back to a normal diet.

Also if I have difficulty I find nothing works better than a plain room temp or warm water enema, you don't need a shitload(har har) of water and just hold it in a few minutes and then going is usually easy and pain free. Plain water doesn't cause cramping or pain, unlike soap or stimulant enemas like you buy in the store. You can buy an enema bulb in a pharmacy for a few bucks and just use water.

I've done a bunch of searching but not finding much.,"Sorry if this has been asked and answered. I looked and am wanting to try again shortly so I'm in need of answers. 

A little info first 
So, I got an 8mg strip. I've wanted to try them for awhile now just to know for myself how it feels. I've known tons of people who have done them, some say they loved it, some not so much. My tolerance is lower now. I was taking probably 60mg of oxy or a bunch of vicodin etc. Usually I'd keep myself on vicodin at around 8 to 10 of the 10mg pills a day. I've cut back and haven't been taking vicodin much at all. I have been taking tramadol and I find it hard to not binge with it. I usually take 6 to 10 of the 50mg pills a day. I had 4 of the 50s 2 days ago. I'm also prescribed adderall 30mg XR's that I take daily as prescribed. From my understanding, this should not matter, the only thing that may happen is it will help you not nod. 
 If I'm forgetting something, I'll answer in the comments, just ask.

So, my first question, I'm unsure how to take them properly. I'm having issues with the saliva filling my mouth pretty quickly. I've only taken 1mg so far but I'm not feeling anything really. It's been 2 hours since I dosed. Should I keep the spit in my mouth or swallow or spit? Is there a way to keep the saliva from coming so quickly and so much? I was getting mixed results when I first took it and swallowed all my saliva probably 5 minutes in. Any other advice with regards to this? 

Also, my wife is trying it too. She takes opiates once in a blue moon. 1 10mg vicodin is good for her. She took .5mg and isn't feeling too much either. Although more than me for sure. She's taking it for the same reason. She's done it once before, it was the pill. She took a piece of it and got sick all night so we took a careful approach with her this time. Do you think taking another half mg would be ok? Or should she try a quarter? 

Lastly, I've heard tramadol still works while on suboxone and is awesome to take. I'm out now so I can't try it this time but if it is I may try it one more time while doing tramadol to see how that is. I'll be done after that. Last thing I want is to get addicted to this stuff too. I just want to get a good feel for it and know how it feels. Eventually I'd like to try about everything just so I know. Curiosity and all that. Thank you in advance for your answers and time!",1420253474.0

Now, I just bought myself an eight ball of mad flavour-esque beige powder, and I wanna take a little puff out of it, just to see how it feels.
I already smoke a lot of fentanyl patches, so I already kinda know how chasing the dragon is done, but smack is expensive and I don't wanna waste any.

I plead my case and show him the card.  He looks it over and looks at me with this ""over the glasses you lucky mother fucker""  look.

(I went to sleep) and   then drink the soda out of it (tastes bad) and the pill will be 100% goo. Chew on it and kind of break the goo a little until it's softer and once it's broken drink the rest of your soda and DAMN. 20 minutes later it hit me all at once. I typically take 2 percs (10s) at once but it even hit me harder than that. If you want your dose to be more potent too (this has worked for me as well for method one and two) take 3 tagamets 45 minutes before you drink the oxy. I don't have any so I didn't do it when texting these methods but they do work for oxycodone.

Method 2 (quicker a little less effective)
Put the OP in your mouth for a minute and lightly chew on it for a second. Take it out of your mouth and then put it in a soda for 1.5-2 hours. Then drink the soda and once the pill is in your mouth you can break it into pieces with your teeth and break it into many pieces as you can without it getting stuck in your teeth. It worked as well but didn't hit as hard. I'd say go with method one if you wanna prepare and you're tired as fuck. But method 2 does work. ",1420237129.0

I plan on using for the next few days to get through my work week, but then I'll be throwing in the towel.

i felt strung out mentally, but no euphoria,  the pain in my knees and back didn't go down, and i got very cold, no warming sensation.

Well the LCSW at his office i saw once a month was the one who actually tested me and she quit back in July, so i hadnt had a piss test since then.

For some reason i figured right afte NYE they would test me. I was right. The last things i did was some dope on last saturday night, so 5-6 days ago. I should be good(i flushed my system this morning), but it still gives me so much anxiety on getting kicked out.

I know we have some health pros on here who post/lurk. Could you all mind explaining to me why they kick you out for a dirty screen? How can you stop treating a patient just for showing symptoms of their disease??? If a diabetic continued to eat unhealthy the dr wouldnt stop treating them/giving them insulin for diabetes.

It just seems so backwards. Most days i take my sub, i only do dope 1-2 times a month, the rest im taking my subs. Being on suboxone has allowed me to keep the same good job 6 years, its allowed me to pay all my bills and be a functioning member of society. Why would the dr kick me out so i have to go back to the street and lose all the progress i made.

It just makes no sense. What if after getting kicked out im really sick and i score and die. Isnt the dr supposed to do whats in my best interest by law and ethically? Anyway the whole thinh is just so fucked up to me. Its my own god damned body and i should be able to do what i please with it as lonh as i dont harm others. Suboxone allows me function, even if i get high here and there. Again how can they kick you out for having symptoms of your disease?

 I also find it ironic im required to go to NA by the dr, which i do and was already doing before seeing that dr. NAs whole thing is ""as long as you have a desire to get better, youre welcome here and that dont freak out over a relapse. It can be part of the journey ofrecovery. Many people relapse and are still welcomed back here."" Its just funny that the dr doesnt see it that way, but forces me to attend and hear these ideas.",1420218275.0

Why is it that opiates get such a bad rep?  Why do other drugs get off the hook so easy in the eyes of the public?  There are hundreds of party songs by now based around Molly and coke that are hugely popular, but songs about heroin are usually very sad and even when they're not..

So this is the first time I've gotten [Ethylphenidate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylphenidate) in crystaline forum. The tablets I was getting from a vendor contained 50mg of Ethylphenidate and a ton of coloring/binder making iv prep... icky. Doing 100mg at once was a feat and I have to assume all the coloring in the pill can't be good for you.

I have to say, I've never been much of a stims fan (used to have a script for Concerta, researched Ethylphenidate as alternative because new doctor won't script anything addictive. Taking orally, 50mg 3-4x/day feels almost exactly like taking Ritalin IR 15-20mg 3-4x/day. For fun time, however, I decided to get a 5g sample of Ethylphenidate in its raw crystal form. Holy shit! It's pretty damned good especially when mixed with some PST. Another redditor stopped by to try and agreed. The crash is pretty mild so long as you stick to only shooting a max of 150-200mg every couple hours and/or you have some benzos/opis around to mix with it.

I'll take this stuff to your average street grade coke any day. Not as uppity and paranoid inducing as MDPV or (Meth)amphetamines while still giving a good mood boost and help with my depression. I'm bipolar I and have a hard time sticking to meds due to side effects (anti-psychotics cause a ton of weight gain... which I'm still working off) and Lithium caused me to become a spaced out zombie... and not in a good sort of spaced out way.

Long story short, Ethylphenidate is a good and relatively inexpensive alternative to Ritalin for those who can't get a legit script and feel they should have one. Orally it just feels like taking Ritalin IR. IVing, however, gives one hell of a rush with euphoria. If I had some dope I'd make it into a speedball. For now, PST and IV Ethylphenidate will suffice.

(Allergy concern),"Hi! So I've been using opiates on and off for a few years now. Thanks to my severe migraines, I basically had codeine on tap at my pharmacy (it pays to chat with your pharmacist every once in a while- getting that much Tylenol 4s, Marinol, Xanax, etc. would look suspicious otherwise!) but I seem to have developed an allergy to codeine maybe 3 months ago. Swelling, hives, the whole lot. I'm also allergic to peanuts so I know what an allergic reaction feels like!




I've since been switched to Vicodin and that has been good so far. I try to keep my pharmaceuticals for when I need them for legitimate reasons, but I do love me some good H. I hadn't had any heroin for about 8 months, then last week I got some BTH. I haven't had any reactions to it yet, but do y'all know how much codeine might be produced when the H metabolizes? The Vicodin also hasn't been an issue at all. I was also given fent by another doctor and I had no problems with that. 



The doctors all know about my allergy to codeine, so their confidence in giving me these alternatives makes me feel a little safer. I don't want to tell them about any heroin use unless I have to, so I'm hoping to get some opinions or links to describe how exactly H breaks down in the body.

Today has been a rather rainy and wintery depressing day.  But my buddy randomly called and said he had some roxis, percs and hydros so I said hell ya! Coped some and now have been feeling great! Man I miss this feeling.  I hope I can do as an every now and then thing and not turn back to the addiction phase again.  Honestly don't know why i am writing this and if your reading this far thanks lol Just felt like saying somethings.  The thought of not having a girl that I can take out and grow with has been weighing on my mind lately.  I'm starting to get to the point where I just want to say fuck it and do mad drugs and ""leave"" reality for a bit.  Ok here I am rambling again. Im going to stop. But before I do let me say that if anyone on here is lonely and would like to talk with someone about anything at all don't hesitate to hit me up.  I can be an ear for listening or words of wisdom.",1420331321.0

But man, fuck drug laws. I just wanna live my life and be high when I feel like it. Is that too much to ask? Instead I'm always looking over my shoulder, trying desperately not to catch another charge because that would be the one that finally sends me away. When I'm driving through Jersey I'm always on high alert, like I'm about to have a panic attack. I do act pretty well when I do get pulled over, but I can't even relax knowing that. 

Its just like there's a looming thought that sooner or later I'm gonna get fucked on one of my runs. I've never been caught with heroin, but I've been caught with various pharms and for dealing weed along with some bunk charges. Hell, I've considered shelling out for a trap to be installed in my car, that's how desperate I am for a little peace of mind. If the shit was legal it'd be pure so there wouldn't be so many overdoses, and the government would make a killing off the taxes because its dirt cheap to make the shit.

So besides wishing you lived in an alternate universe where no one gives you shit for doing a bit of dope, what do you guys do to relax? What precautions do you take to be safe when riding around with bundles or bricks? Have any of you had a decently long career with heroin and avoided jail/prison time? Some might say I'm not cut out for this if I can't handle the stresses that come with, but I've already made it almost a decade in being an opiate user.

I realized once again why I always get tired of this game and try to stop but eventually start again, but this is irrelevant. I will note that I feel like I'll be struggling with addiction for the rest of my life. I feel like no matter how long I'm clean for, *eventually* I'll always come back to drugs. Life is usually so boring when I am sober, after all, I've experienced one of the greatest enlightening blisses man or woman can possibly experience. One poster wrote the other day something along the lines that, ""Once you've tasted the forbidden fruit, plain apples just don't satisfy you anymore."" Too true...

So today, I picked up an 1/8 of some quality bud, and as I'm waiting, a close friend just **gives** me 3 -15mg roxi, 2 - 2mg Kipns, and one OP20 for free! **Shit like this never happens when I'm actively using!** *Disclaimer, I'm fairly sure he ran into a decent comeup, due to his generosity to me and him usually never having any type of money. But nothing was specifically discussed.* I took the pills because well, free drugs is free drugs... but it's weighing on me a little.

So now I'm debating on whether or not to suffer semi-WDs for the next couple nights, for a possible night of fun. I also wonder if taking these will even be worth it as Rx's seemed to just keep me out of WD when I've had a nice dope habit/binge of fairly good quality ECP insufflated a day (roughly 0.5-1.5g a day habit, depending on how much cash I had and could hustle).

Needless to say, if I do decide to indulge, the amount of opiates/benzos that I was given will only last the evening (I may save 2mg of the kpins either way)

So I see a few options available to me: 1. Give the drugs back to my buddy, thanking him but just telling him I can't, and continue down sobriety for awhile. He'd def be cool with it, more drugs for him. 2. Party tonight with the goods and chance starting this vicious cycle all over again (not just WD cycle). 3. Sell the pills (except maybe one of the kpins as I'll use that to sleep) probably get $50-60. That would def be enough to buy a half g if I wanted to be positive I'd get noddy. 4. Give them away to another buddy or 5. Dispose of them (shudder).

I'd appreciate some advice from people who might advise me on what *THEY* would do, not what *I* should necessarily do.

I might add, I am super tempted to go all out tonight on what I have, but also kinda worried it may lead me right back to where I just was. Not a good place.

Thx to anyone who provides some input! And I hope everyone has a fresh start with 2015!

So today contained a pretty eventful last few hours, to say the least lol. So I picked up a 20 for this kid, he's like 18ish (I'm 19, 20 next month, for reference) around 6pm-ish. Anyway, so I get this pretty hooked up bag from my connect, and it's from his fire new batch that's def better than his old shit. Once we get it, we make the like 10 min or less walk to this music rehearsal studio building in the industrial, ghetto ass section of my city. I used to rent a room there for my band to practice years ago. The place is really lenient... the landlord rented to me when I was 16, everyone there was always several months late on rent without consequence, smoking/partying was common/allowed in the building, several people lived there, even tho it wasn't technically legal for them to do so lol.... 

But yeah like over a year or two ago, when everyone that was throwing in on rent just stopped, and I lost my job and really couldn't afford it anymore... I just called the landlord and let him know about the situation. All I had to do was move my stuff out, clean up, and leave lol. I didn't owe any of the rent I had yet to pay. Dude was maaaaad chill! Anyway, so since then, I've been there with friends to use the hallway bathrooms, since the doors leading into the building don't lock, it's always open with lights on 24/7, and the bathrooms have running water. Plus no one would see me plus other ppl going into them, so it's perfect if I gotta split shit up, or shoot people up.

I went into the bathroom with him, and he put a lot of shit in the cap, and kept putting more. I warned him (as I had done b4) about the overdose risk, but he was confident that it would be okay. So I shot him up, and he says ''Damn, I can taste it!. Then says ''Whoa... that shit hit me hardbody''.... After a few mins of him looking more and more jammed, he slowly brings himself to a sitting position on this dirty bathroom floor. Then like a min later, he started to make the dreaded ''snoring/gurgling'' sound that indicates the person is tryna breathe but can't really. So I started yelling to him, doing the sternum rub, slapping his face, trying to see if he was good. After not even a min of that not working, for I didn't wanna waste any time (since I stupidly didn't have any narcan with me), I called 911. This was actually my first time calling 911 for any reason whatsoever, so I wasn't really sure what to do. I did know to not blatantly mention it was an 'overdose' to the operator, so I said my friend stopped breathing. I got directed to my city's 911 operator, then the cataldo ambulance operator. 

Even tho this place has a weird address (Our building we were in, along with prob like 5-10 other buildings technically have the same address... gps's ALWAYS fuck up and never bring you to the right building if you don't know where to go and just put the address in and expect it to bring you there correctly), they showed up in under 10 mins from when I called. Prob like 6-7 mins. I was pretty impressed. There was one of those smallish fire engines with no ladder on top, an ambulance, and 1 or 2 cop cars. I directed them upstairs to the bathroom, and they did what they needed to. They used I think a manual respirator pump thingy, and two things of nasal narcan. He luckily came to, and they brought him to the ER. The cop was questioning me on things a bit afterwards, and I realized that my boy left his coat, headphones, phone, hat, and charger cable in the bathroom. So I told the cop they were his, and he brought them to him in the ER I guess... for like an hour or so later, I got a call from him saying 'yo good looks dude'.

Anyway, so hours later, I get a call from someone else needing a gram. We get it, and go back to his apartment that's not far at all from my house. We both do our shots. He's able to hit himself on the first try, which is unlike him lol. After he does it, he's gettin up and sorta like pacing around. I hear him sorta like slapping himself in the face doing that 'popping' sound with his open mouth, hitting his cheeks... but he starts like hitting himself harder and harder, and he eventually hits the ground and is like shaking, banging mad hard on the floor, acting weird af. He appeared to be breathing, but possibly having a seizure or something. So I call 911 again, and this time have an actual address to give them. Now keep in mind I made all the calls and said everything right in front of my boy. So the ambulance/FD/cops get here, even quicker than earlier, and whaddya know... it's like the same exact cops/paramedics and shit... oh god. So yea they were sorta dickish to me and whatnot, tryna accuse me of shit (even tho im in MA, and we got the Good Samaritan law)... anyway, so I was downstairs by the door talking to the cop, and the paramedics go up to the 3rd floor to his apartment to help my boy. They come down only a few mins later claiming that he was apparently faking the seizure/OD. The paramedic said he told him to 'stop' and he did. And that he was like perfectly fine. 

I was speechless/baffled. They didn't think I like called them for no reason, and I explained that I even called right in front of him, so it wasn't like a joke or anything.... So anyway, the cop was like concerned that I was at the scene of two ''ODs'' only a few hrs apart. So I went home, and the cops said they'd be there to ''fill in my parents'', even tho I told them they already know what I do (to an extent lol). So yea I get home, and like 5-10 mins later, the cops ring the bell. I answer myself, and they obv wanna talk to one of my parents. So I say they're trying to sleep, but they want me to just bring one down, so I get my dad. So the cop is just telling my dad the jist of what happened, leaving out a lot of details and shit, and of course my overly dramatic mom has to come down and act all hysterical over shit lol. But she has been through a lot I suppose... Anyway the cops didn't act like they were tryna get me in trouble or anything, they were just looking out for me I guess. Which I like to see that they seen it as an actual problem, and not some criminal issue. So yeah my mom bitched at me for a lil bit after they left, and I'm here typing this now haha.

Due to a scheduling mishap, I am going to have to go 21 days without Oxy. Today was my second day and I realized how much I had started to depend on it, and was thankful that I was on the rehab process, until I found some more medication that I had forgotten about (I was reluctant to take it at first).

Anyhow, I was/am an IV heroin addict for the last three years. I would pick up a 3.1 for $220 about every 3-5 days depending on how hard I went. I decided to kick on New Year's Day, but had some leftover, so it was prolonged a bit, but you guys know how that goes. I was still determined to rid myself of this addiction. 

The first time the withdrawal set it after 24 hours of no use I panicked and found a bunch of old cottons. I made a nasty ass cotton shot that actually got me high as hell. Oops. After shooting it, I felt bad, but got refocused. With the energy I had from my last dose I cleaned everything out, flushed all the cottons, and decided there was no more time to waste.

I had been planning this withdrawal for a few months, which gave me the time to amass the following meds:

About 14 clonodine
30 gabapentin
bottle of lope
2 grams of dank
 .7g of methamphetimines
10 Ativan
about 5 Xanax quadbars.

Using all these combined I was amazed at how nearly painless my withdrawal was compared to the time I went cold turkey. Don't get me wrong, I still felt it, and it wasn't pleasant, but it was definitely totally doable.

I took 150mg of gaba twice a day, 1 clonodine in the morning, one at night, lope by the handful as needed, smoked weed when I needed a cigarette (fuck me it was cold to the bone outside), and smoked meth throughout the whole thing. When I wanted to sleep, 1 Ativan and half a bar put me out like a light. Granted, the sleep was sporadic, I still tossed and turned, but the 4-5 hours I would get were priceless.

I am starting day four, and am starting to feel a little better. I'm almost out of the woods and couldn't be happier. 

Now the real test: Staying clean and beating PAWS. Wish me luck guys, and thanks for reading. Hope this may help anyone who wants to kick.

Thanks in advance if you read it or answer my questions. I've been browsing this sub for a few days and it has honestly helped me to understand everything a smidge more...even though a lot of it makes me sick to my stomach, you guys are an alright community. 

Let me preface this by letting you know I am not a user of opiates. But my cousin was. He took his own life in December and I am trying so hard to understand what he was going through. We had a special bond from the time we were small, he was more like my brother than anything. I hadn't seen him in a long time.

He got into drugs when we were still very young, high school age. I'd say he had been in a consistently altered state for about ten or eleven years. It started out very casually with pot and various pills, mostly speed type things. He had someone with a steady supply of Adderall and he was happy with that for a long time. But eventually he started branching and trying other things. Everything from meth to ecstasy to acid to mushrooms and beyond. He never stayed with anything too long and some things he only tried once or twice. 

Opiates came along when he hurt his back. He had a script, when it ran out he continued to use. I gradually started to see changes in him. He would go no contact for days/weeks at a time. He was irritable and would get hateful with people around him. He knew exactly what to say to cut right through a person. When we had our falling out, he said awful things to me and I was so hurt but I knew he wasn't himself. Looking back on it I feel like he might have been trying to create distance. 

I heard through friends that he had started snorting heroin, but I couldn't confirm and I put it out of my mind so as not to make myself sick with worry. I was positive that he would never shoot up, he HATED needles, and he treated IV users with great disdain. He had a friend that used IV and he talked so much shit about that dude. Said he was stupid and taking unecessary risks. 

I guess a few months before he died, he was arrested. He had paraphernalia on him, I think needles or syringes or something. 

I know that he was using IV heroin. I know based on people I've talked to that it was a relatively new thing. Here's where my questions come in, and if someone can answer them for me I'd be so greatful...I realize no one can tell me exactly what he was feeling or thinking but I have this voracious need to just get an idea. I want so badly to understand. 

Is there anyone here who switched to IV use that had previously been adament about never using needles? 

If so, why did you start IV use? 

How did making that trasition feel, emotionally speaking? Like were you shocked at yourself or? 

I need to hear it from someone who knows. 

Thanks again for taking the time to read this, I'm really struggling with this whole thing. I hope I didn't say anything offensive and if I did I'm really sorry. I don't want to pass judgement on anyone, drugs just scare the holy hell out of me.

So I'm pretty sure I took the one at first..and somehow ate the second soon after. Me and my boy had bunch of stuff we had came up on and we ended up going over to my dude's house. The guy who I bought the original 4 off. Ended up trading him some of the stuff we had (a bunch of different shit, from blu-rays to hygiene) So I know we got at least a few more bars as well as some ativan.

I came across a 50 mcg/h Fentanyl Transdermal System today. It's made by Mallinckrodt and appears to be a matrix style patch (no gel inside). 

I am currently a casual opiate user, taking around 4 Norco 10's to reach desired effects. I'm male 6' ~200lbs. I have a good bit of experience with high test opiates and the likes (Oxy, roxy, OP, methadone, opium, etc, not h though), but currently have a fairly low tolerance from lack of use. 

I've used Fentanyl patches before and enjoyed the effects, but it was years ago and I was using roughly 20-40mg of Methadone per day at the time. I'm also not sure of the dose of those patches. I remember I'd wear it for 24 hours or so (or until it started making me nauseas) then I would take it off and enjoy the rest of the ride, maybe cut it open and eat a little gel before disposal. 

After doing a little research today, I realized how stupid it was for me to do that and am considering myself lucky to be alive. I read a few horror stories over at bluelight and they have me a little nervous.

Which brings me here..

I'd like to know if this will be safe for me to use with my level of experience and low - moderate tolerance. I plan on using transdermally as recommended, but would like some input on proper procedure and/ or dosage. 

Can I cut the patch into smaller pieces or will that make it unreliable and/or dangerous?

Can I put it on until I reach my desired state and then remove it?

Is there a way to find the proper dosage for a casual user such as myself? I know it can be hard to judge doses with these things, but will cutting in half or quarters give me at least a general idea of dose? (Example: 50mcg cut in half = 2 25mcg patches)

Or should I simply just not use it? 

I apologize for the wall of text. I just want to be sure of my options and risks. 

Thanks in advance!


Edit: For anyone curious, I'm still alive! I cut the patch in half and placed 1 strip on my shoulder for approximately 5 hours then removed it. I got a good little buzz, but it was far from the sedation I remembered. About an hour after removal the buzz was pretty much non existent so I went to bed. I dont think I came anywhere near an OD lol. Thank y'all for the tips and concern! I have a friend that wants the other half, and wants to trade some norcos for it, so I suppose I'll let her try the other half and I'll just enjoy the pills instead.",1420488095.0

I'm not a user, but I confess to reading this sub religiously - you guys are alright!  Subscribing here has made me more understanding and compassionate of panhandlers, for one thing, and more aware of the public health realities of how badly we treat addicts.  I was already in favor of decriminalization and needle exchanges and such, but I had not idea about the prevalence of states criminalizing rigs and pharmacists refusing to sell them.

So, my cousin.  She moved home to Cincinnati from Nashville to get away from her abusive boyfriend.  She brought their daughter and was confident that he couldn't do much about it because he has a number of warrants.  We got together and she told me she had been addicted to Oxy.  Her and the baby were staying with her parents.  That was in September, and I heard just before Thanksgiving that she'd been arrested for playing getaway driver while the aforementioned boyfriend robbed a check cashing place (of all the ignorant things to get caught up in).  

Of course I assume she was still using, and I assume H as well as pills.  She's been in jail through the holidays - boyfriend has a rap sheet that means he's going away for a long time.  The baby is still with her parents, and they won't bail her out.  Sadly, I agree with their decision.  Like many people on here say, you can't get clean unless you're ready and she is definitely not ready - still scheming and not realizing when people are trying to help her.

I'm honestly not sure what I wanted to accomplish with this post other than get it off my chest.  I wish you all the very best, hoping first for your safety and an easy time getting clean and, failing that, then at least happy nods in 2015.

I do have a script for 30s I get every month and I almost never touch them,  maybe take 1 or 2 a month when needed. Now my question is this,  since my use never effected me in ANY negative manner, never had any money issues from it,  health issues, family issues, job issues (self employed) and never had any really cravings would you see any issue with trying to chip? The reason I want to occasionally use again is just for something to do...  I do not enjoy smoking weed,  I don't like drinking, I don't like tripping,  I hate any form of speed.  The only drug I have enjoyed was opiates, was basically a hobby for me,  although daily. I have taken my 30s a few times since being clean and honestly just don't enjoy it,  just kind of stock pile them for some weird ass reason.  Does this mean I wouldn't enjoy H since Iv quit?  I guess my reason for quiting was seeing some of my friends or people I knew pput themselves in some hard spots because of it,  like putting dope before there success and what not...  Never understood that.  Never.  And I was scared I could possibly become that or be content just ""surviving"".

After picking up today we've had a. It of a trade going on. He's taking roxi 30s every three hours. I've been giving him some dope to snort and he puts the roxi under his tongue. As soon as the nude walks out he passes it over to me. It's worked out nicely. His post op pain has been controlled with his DOC and I get to have my DOC. I'm in love with the blues. 

In a few hoes wen the pharmacy opens I'm going to fill his scrip of generic opana G series 30mg. I'll pay the co-pay and he'll give me twenty of them.

READ THAT SHIT!

Hey cruel world, how's it going? Hope all my brothers and sisters of this sub are currently doing well. I've been away for awhile mainly because my PC shit the bed and I lost not one, but TWO iphones (long story but let's just say I was fucked long and hard) so mt internet capabilities went down the drain. If I didn't know what withdraw was I'd say I went into an internet withdraw but unfortunately I know all too well what WD's feel like and it's nowhere near being inconvenienced by not having the internet 24/7. Being a Junkie really puts things into perspective sometimes. Anyways for Christmas I was able to get a few bucks together and bought my boys old PC rig so now I'm baaaaack! Not that you guys would notice since I've mostly been a lurker this past year and a half but fuck it gonna try and change that. So last week (right after the holidays) I was suspended from my job for some BS for a week which couldn't have been at a worse time considering I was dead broke from the holidays and had this monkey on my back that's always hungry. Somehow someway I fucking made it through that week and now things are back to normal thank god. Today after work I went and picked up a few buns from my boy, the stuff's decent but his prices are good and he's always around been dealing with him for like 4 years now, wow time flies when your getting high. So after my first shot I get home and decided why not do another I have 2 buns left fuck it. I open bag number one pour it out usual size, pour out bag number two and in the immortal words of Champ Kind ""WHAMMY!"" about a full bun's worth of product came out. I was so excited I think I came just a little bit, well if I ever did cum I would have but that's another issue altogether now. So I set some aside because even though I'm miserable as fuck I'm not trying to OD. Mix up my shot as I put my bags away thanking Junkie Jesus that I'll actually be straight for tomorrow a feeling I haven't had since the holidays. Well that's about it sorry for rambling but I'm euphoric as shit after that shot. Time to kick back smoke some cigs and watch a little Bleach marathon. How's everybody else doing now that the holidays are over? I'm gonna try and make an effort and not be a weird lurker dude anymore. Have anything you wanna talk about just shoot (haha get it?)

Even while high I was pouring sweat like crazy in some kind of sick fever, and now the WDs are giving me intermittent sweats as well.

However i've only really tried tramadol and hydrocodone, so maybe i just have a naturally high tolerance to hydrocodone? 



I'll start off by saying i've really only gotten a good high once. My first time i took 30mg hydrocodone and i got pretty damn euphoric, i mean i could still function normally but i just felt fantastic.



 Every time since has pretty much been me chasing the dragon, with no luck. Next time i took 35mg...literally nothing. Then i tried 35mg with 100mg tramadol and still felt literally nothing. Much later i took 40mg, i threw up but i still didn't really get anywhere. After a few more attempts i decided i should quit opiates all together, since they were the only drugs to give me cravings and i might as well quit while i'm ahead.



Anyway, one of my rules is that i'm allowed to take opiates only if they're prescribed to me. And before new years i had acquired 15 vicodin (5/325) for the pain, and i only ended up needing 4 for the pain. So i decided to take the rest, 11 vicodin, on new years. 



So it had been nearly a year since the last time i did an opiate, i take 55mg within the span of 3-4 hours, probably 8 in the last 2 hours of that window. Still didn't get high, i mean i didn't get high at *all*. I know it was a lot of APAP, but it was still under 4g and i never ran into any problems. 


Honestly, it surprised me how hard it was to convince myself to quit opiates. I mean that first high was perfect. After i had decided to quit opiates i still tried to buy more opiates off someone the next day and that honestly scared me a bit. Thankfully i got ripped off and it was just acetaminophen, the poppy seeds i ordered never came in, and my most recent attempt on new years was completely unsuccessful. I'm not saying opiates are the devil, but god damn if i didn't have a natural tolerance i could easily see myself getting addicted. 


TL;DR pretty high natural tolerance to hydrocodone, maybe not such a bad thing.

Sorry in advance for the long post, but I need some advice from people who know what they're talking about. 

Got into H a year ago after a much longer every-so-often love affair with pills. Still haven't used a needle, just sniff. For about 9 months I kept my use to 1-2 times week, and then the past 3 months in between losing a girlfriend and the cold, dark winter setting in, I've gotten closer to daily use, 4-5 times a week at least. Somehow on the days I haven't used, I haven't had physical withdrawals, but I've certainly noticed heightened depression and anxiety (both of which I've dealt with my whole life) and mental cravings. I've never been someone to use all day long (only after work, or late afternoon/early evening on weekends.)

My dealer moved at the beginning of the month, and it was around then I was realizing I was in over my head. I bought a LOT from him before he left (probably enough to last me the next 2 weeks or so of daily use). I don't have any other options for scoring more and honestly, I don't want to...I realize I'm in over my head and am already sick of my rationalizations and cravings. 

Now the question: I'm back and forth on whether I should just keep up my usual pattern of use until I finish my supply, or if I should try now to stop for a few consecutive days/up to a week or so just to see if I can. Regardless, I intend to be rid of the habit when I run out. So is it better to get used to being without it now, or does ""quitting"" twice just trick me into having a more difficult time with it the second time around?

In my experience, one of the side effects of leading an alternate lifestyle is that you come into contact with some weird people and sometimes find yourself in crazy situations that you wouldn't otherwise experience. 

So, let's talk about weird shit that has happened to you or your friends in the course of being Bout That Life.

I'll start with one of my own and one that happened to my friend. 

I live in Vietnam and my friend started dating his Vietnamese neighbor. They hit it off and they got a place together. He had used dope in front of her and thought they were on the same page as far as moderate use being okay. Then, he came home from work to find that she had logged into his facebook and used it to contact his parents and tell them that he was wildly addicted to drugs. 

Ouch, right? 

And mine: 

I've always wanted to go to an opium den, like the kind where you lay on big pillows for like 12 hours staring at a candle while a girl prepares your pipes. So for the last few years, since I moved here, I've been asking everyone who seems like they would know (drug dealers and old men basically) with no luck. 

But, about a year ago, I started buying dope from an ethnically Chinese but Vietnamese raised guy from the Saigon Chinatown (which is huge, basically a city within a city). He said 'Oh yeah, opium dens! I can take you to one.' I was amped. So we drove through Chinatown to a sort of sketch area on the outskirts of town and down some alleyways until we got to an apartment building-looking type of place, up some stairs and into a very skeezy one bedroom apartment filled with about a dozen junkies sitting on the ground around some candles. Unfortunately, he had taken me to a shooting gallery.  

It was kinda tense at first but I bought some dope (a great deal, I got like a .25 for 100,000 dong or $5) and shared some foils with the smokers and explained myself in my retarded baby Vietnamese and it turned out okay. Then a guy ran in the door and said something really quickly and everyone got up and started moving out really quickly. I didn't understand what was going on but figured I'd go with the flow so we walked outside. 

Turns out, there was a cockfight going on (my first, although I've now been to a bunch and was even a part owner of a valiant rooster named Bootsy, that's another story though) and I threw my money (like, $5) on the smaller, feistier-looking cock and won $5 and then I went home and did the rest of my dope. 

That's the story of how I went to a shooting gallery and then won $5 on a cockfight. 

Now...your turn. Narrow escapes from the police? Witnessed a robbery? Fell asleep while eating a chick out? Go to town.",1420661776.0

For a long time I heated my H, whether using BTH or ECP. Thats what you see in the movies and what my friends did so I followed suit without questioning. Recently I switched over to not using any heat at all. From a harm reduction as well as a getting high stand point which is the better option?

Seems to me heating it will likely kill any bacteria that may be residing, but could also result in the cut and other unwanted goodies dissolving into the water, where they otherwise may not have. 

Cold shots on the other hand, do not kill any bacteria, but probably help keep unwanted particles undissolved. The other obvious benefit is that there is no need to worry about heat degrading the product.

Any thoughts or opinions are welcome, and for the sake of this argument disregard pills as they often times require different methods as a result of the pills fillers rather than the active ingredient. Nod on my brothers and sisters.

My grandmother and this lady have been friends for over 40 years. She has a plethora of ailments, but in the last year has been dealing with cancer in the form of multiple myeloma in her spine. Since none of her 4 sons can (read: are willing to) take her to chemo appts or hire a home health aide for her, I've volunteered to help out. I've had experience as a licensed CNA, and have worked with both the elderly and hearing impaired (she's both). Things have been going mostly ok, but there's something I'm concerned about and feeling a bit conflicted.

I do know that this lady has legitimate pain and I feel terrible for her. However, I feel like they're may be something going on with her pill usage beyond pain management. I'm sure I might get some down votes for this. And I promise I'm not trying to be a judgmental asshole. I realize that I can't possibly know what she feels. 

In the last year, she was started on percs, then switched to straight oxy IR. After some time she developed tolerance and was put on dilaudid 4 mg/every four hours as needed for pain. More recently her oncologist gave her a script for fent patches, 12 MCG at first. For whatever reason the local pharmacies didn't carry such a low dose so the Dr bumped the script to 50 MCG. She's been on the patches since I've been caring for her. Initially she didn't think they worked but after going 24 hrs without them, she said the pain returned and they did work. In the mean time, she's been asking for the dilaudid every four hours like clockwork. 

In the time I've been caring for her, I've gotten familiar with her habits, routines, and behavior. I've noticed that even when she does not appear to be in pain or complaining of it, she still asks for her pain pill. Other things I've noticed is that she'll be quite chatty and happy go lucky and will stop to mention how she should take her pain pill. Then she'll forget about it for awhile and go back to being happy again. It almost seems like... more of an emotional crutch than anything else. 

I realize this is getting long and i apologize. Basically when I took her to her primary care doctor last Friday, and gave her list of meds, he said that with her poor kidney function, and age, both the moderate dose of fent and dilaudid was overkill. He said the fent should be sufficient since the radiation killed off the actual myelomas and that she should reserve the pills for when the pain gets severe. He explained that both meds together taken on a regular basis were toxic to her body. Anyway, on the ride home, we got hit by a car that ran a stoplight. Everyone was ok (thank God) but I convinced her to go to the ER just in case. All her tests came back and she sustained no injuries aside from general soreness. She asked for pain meds and after looking over her chart and meds, the ER doctor said the fent patch should be more than enough. By this time, one of her sons showed up. The ER Dr explained that the amount of narcotics she was on would kill any one of us, make us stop breathing. He agreed to give her a shot of dilaudid after she started moaning when we first said no to more meds. That was around 7pm. We got her home by 9. No sooner were we in the door and she was asking for a pain pill. We tried to explain that she couldn't have one until 11 but she didn't want to accept that or understand that she'd *just* had it in IV form. 

Sunday she was forced into the hospital because she refused to taker her regular meds, eat, drink or take antibiotics for a uti (that's why I'd taken her to her primary care Dr the previous Friday). The only thing she was willing to take were the pain pills. So today I came in again to care for her. All day long she talked about how they gave her a strong dose of IV morphine at the hospital and that she didn't want to come home because of that. And when she wasn't talking about that, she was watching the clock, counting down till her next dose of dilaudid. And now she claims that the 50 MCG fent ""doesn't do anything"". Can tolerance build that quickly for fentanyl?

I've tried talking to her sons about this. Two of them reluctantly agree that she may have a problem. They said last night she got a shot of pain medicine before being discharged from the hospital and twenty min later when they got home, she was asking for a pill. Her one son lives with her and refuses to deny her the pills. Otherwise he has to listen to her getting mad and carrying on all night and he works long hours and needs sleep. He doesn't seem to understand that giving her the pills more often than every four hours could be dangerous.

I feel like I'm in a tricky position. As her care taker, do I follow the doctor's suggestions or do I give in like her son? There was a suggestion from one son about giving her sugar pills to see if it is a placebo effect but I don't know how I'd feel about deceiving someone who trusts me with her care. Am I crazy or does this sound like she may have a problem? I don't want her to stop breathing on me because of overdoing it on these narcotics...

tl;dr  Caring for elderly lady, think she might be addicted, claims 50 MCG fent does nothing for pain and take dilaudid pills like candy.",1420787720.0

I'm wondering if anyone else experiences this. Even the next day my vision seems a little bit fucked up, so I'm wondering if this is causing vision problems with any degree of permanence with long-term and constant use.

He was in there for like 15 min! So I pressed my ear close to the door and listened to hear if I could make out any movement or activity coming from the other side.  Like a stealthy spy I was able to discern not noises of pissing or defecating but another sound that was not common to hear in bathroom stalls. It sounded like scraping and snorting? 

I was quite upset that it sounded as if this gentleman was not using the bathroom stalls for their intended uses and also because I had waited around 30 min to take a poop and I could barely hold it within my ever widening ass crack.

So I did what anyone would of done and i kicked in the stall door, using extreme force from my right foot and yelled 

""What the hell are you  Doing!!!""

To my shock this guy yelled back "" Oh my Gosh!""  and I could see he had crushed up a bunch of pills it looked like and he had been snorting them!  he quickly pushed what was left off the edge and ran out.

So, with that said, the standard time of you waiting to take a sub is 24 hours after your last dose, however, if I use DXM with my dope, from what I understand (rough understanding...) it basically inhibits the enzyme that processes dope so it stays on my receptors longer...meaning half life is longer? Would you have to wait even longer than the standard 24 hours to take a sub? Or is the dope off the receptors by the usual 24 hours? Because I really would not like to go into precipitated wds.

I went to a medical detox last year but I was doing it for someone else and I just had the wrong attitude about the whole thing. But I'm just so sick of things going the way they are, unemployed, strung out on dope (which feels impossible to get away from here in Chicago).

I know I need help but the idiot part of me thinks I should just get a few xanax and subs and do it at home. At least the detox I went to before helped get me into a methadone program (which I wish I had stuck with as at least a good option in terms of my sanity, stability, and harm reduction period). 

I am so weak when it comes to doing this alone. I have a college diploma, not to mention my other good personal qualities and instead I piss it all away throwing money at the problem (ultimately that I don't love myself or something). Dope prevents me from pursuing a career, from the guy I love (who I think is afraid to finally take it to the next level because I need to get my shit straightened out), from having an apartment and car, from being social, etc.

I'm just so afraid. I at least want to get on methadone because it really made me feel I could start working on my other problems more effectively. Also my insurance is valid (good blue cross policy my grams pays for) but I need a new card since I lost it). I want to go into the hospital asap though.

[Trip Report I guess][meth/heroin/Ambien] [cross post from /r/drugs],"Throwaway for purposes I don't care to disclose, if anyone thinks they know who I am, shut up. On one cares and you are being an ass. Yes this will be long but it will also be worth reading and not just the ramblings of a stupid meth head(I hope). I am still pretty awake from it and coming back into reality a bit so at times it might be a bit unnecessary(like this part for example)but I feel like every paragraph is worth reading. Enjoy

Anyway so Last night I hear there's some meth around and my buddy were gonna split a quarter g($50 here unfortunately...very good quality though but seriously rape prices). Before I describe the actual high and such, I feel I should give a little bit of background info.

There are 3 drugs in the story I partake in, meth.heroin and Ambien, all are taken iv and my tolerance for meth is very very low(since I discovered it a ear ago I've had 4 sessions of it. Fun sometimes but too long lasting and intense for my liking.). Heroin is my DOC and has been since I found it and probably always will be. I can't get enough of that shit, its bad. Currently have a low-medium tolerance/habit. If I want to get high from meth by itself, I normally do a 50mg shot mixed with a bag or two of heroin sometimes. I find if i do a shot of meth and then do another shortly, it gets too intense and I start doing all my dope and shit. So heroin I will do maybe 3-5 bags in a shot depending on quality(been getting fire recently so 3 has been messing me up) in order to try and catch a nod.

Now it's been a while since I've done meth and I figured, hey, let's do a big shot and see how it goes. I have Ambien to bring me down if i start getting bad. So I put in between .1 and .125 into the shot, not sure honestly but that was my best guess at the time, along with 3 bags of some fuego dope. Pulled it back and plunged it in....

Holy.Shit.This.Is.Fucking.Insane.Fuck.Fuck.Holy.Shitballs.That.Was.AMAZING

I have done goofballs before but never with so much of each drug. I've done the same amount of dope but with only half the ice in it so the high was borderline nodding for a while(also a quite a fun high but not on this level).

Basically, the best way to describe how it felt is as follows. If you've ever done heroin via IV, that was the first thing I felt. Wasn't insanely strong and at first I was kind of worried that I had missed the rush from the crystal. Then, about 10 seconds in, I start to get this amazing feeling spreading throughout my body. I am not even remotely exaggerating when I say this is the single best my body has ever felt. I could have ran 25 marathons in a row without breaking a sweat. The meth rush creeped up and up on me until next thing you know, my entire body is feeling amazing and I'm getting the notorious tingling in my brain. Seemed like in total, the rush felt like it lasted about 1-2 minutes. I'm used to like 10-15 seconds max really with dope. I even started to get mildly nauseous and thought I might actually puke from the intensity but it quickly subsided and turned into the greatest feeling man can experience.

So now that the rush was over, in set in the best feeling high I have ever had by far. I dunno if the guy I got this ice from had particularly good shit or it was just the higher dose of ice combined with more dope and higher quality dope to boot.My head was still, like a zen master. My mind wasn't racing 10 million miles a minute like when I did purely ice or other stimulants. I felt like I have created the grand unifying theory at that moment and it would have been cake. Any mental task seemed childish, my brain was so sharp and clear and ready to absorb information, as much as possible and as quickly as possible. Clearly my brain would not be the bottleneck in this situation.. At the same time, my body felt so fucking good I couldn't believe it. I literally felt like I was floating when I walked. I'm sure some of you here know what I'm talking about but you really do think you are floating pretty much. Like you know you aren't but you seem to move so fluidly and gracefully that it feels like it. That was the most euphoric, amazing feeling I've ever had on drugs I think. If meth wasn't so long lasting, I would be screwed and I'd probably do speed balls like that until the day I died. The negative effects are just too rough on my body, i bite the shit out of myself, cant stay hydrated and I fucking hate not sleeping.

Here's where the crazy part comes in though.So after that amazing feeling subsided(did that first big shot at about 9pm or so), decided to sell just a 10 bag of meth and finish the rest myself. So I did, talked with the kid I sold the 10 bag to, read about a bunch of shit online(found out horrible news about teaching English in other countries :( ) Did another speed ball at around 7am or so that was fun but not nearly as good.

Then, at 330pm EST (1 hour ago as of writing this) I decided to take the last of my shit(3 bags of dope, no meth, 2 Ambien). and combine 1 of the Ambien with the 3 bags of dope. My body was kind of achy, not feeling great in general because I was up all night, etc.I was also tired and wanted a chance to pass out and figured the Ambien could help with it. I almost decided to do 2 Ambien but I figured there wasn't too much of a chance that I would actually fall asleep so I had better just do 1 now and then one in the evening when I get some more dope or something.

So after scouring the carpet for any dropped pieces of meth( you guys know what I'm talking about lol), I decided 330 was a good time to do this, it had been now like 9 hours or so since I had last done dope, I should get a good rush and I was starting to feel pretty lousy body wise. As I pushed in the plunger, the most unique and incredible high I have ever had came over me. I got a mild rush from the dope but nothing crazy(to be expected in this situation) but at the same time I got the little rush the Ambien gives. Now keep in mind, I only took 5mg of Ambien. I drew that up first and then squirted some of the water out, added dope and redrew it back up for a combo syringe.

I have shot Ambien before so the rush wasn't a new feeling, I enjoy shooting 2 at the same time without anything, gives a weird rush and then subsides quickly(way too quickly imo). I have even done it with dope and it just makes the rush a bit more intense and I don't need to do as much dope and I can still nod. But I have never done it after having stayed awake for a day and a half while on the tail end of a meth high. What followed was the most unique and entertaining high I have probably ever had.

Al of the sudden, I started dreaming while awake, with my eyes open. Basically, I was hallucinating dreams. My hallucinations weren't like full blown dmt hallucinations but it was more like I was looking at objects, thinking they were something else when in reality they had only shifted shape slightly. I was hallucinating different dream like scenarios, where people were saying things to me, I would start to respond but realize what I was doing as soon as I started talking and would start laughing because I was addressing my coat hanging on the back of a chair as a person and saying something serious.

The interesting thing is I was so close to being able to control it but I couldn't really pick the situation, just felt like I had control over the outcome once it started. I kept realizing that I was talking to no one and kept laughing out loud and saying to myself, ""You are talking to a coat you dumbass!"". A few were quite intense, some very serious, some just comical but they just kept going rapid fire. It was awesome and even happened a few times while I was typing this but only in that I would get distracted and start listening to a conversation in a ""dream"" but know it was a dream and not say anything. Just listened. As time went on, I was able to sit by and observe what was going on without falling head over heels into the dream. I haven't actually responded to one of them since when I began writing this post(25minutes ago as of now).

That's pretty much it, if you made it through this whole post congratulations to you but I felt like I needed to document this as it was certainly one of the most unique experiences(both the speedball and the ambienball) I have ever had on drugs.

If anyone is like hey, this sounds awesome I want to do it. Remember to be careful mixing Ambien and dope. It's essentially mixing dope with a benzo and shooting them, can be quite dangerous. I wasn't worried as much because the meth was in me but I am quite sure that if I had only done the dope and Ambien without any meth involved I would have just passed out, I normally use a little less dope if I mix them on their own but I knew the meth would come into play so I figured I might as well do a bit extra. I am glad I didn't use the second Ambien as well though, I can't imagine what that would have been like.

Also, while I seriously don't have an issue using meth occasionally(just don't like too many aspects of it), it's super addictive and shooting is supposedly the worst way. Personally I shoot everything I do,. I never even did anything besides shooting it with the exception of smoking it once. Personally I think smoking hits you harder and is easily just as addictive as shooting. But to be fair, once you have a tolerance I guess, you wouldnt be able to smoke enough fast enough to get the kind of rush shooting will give you. But I digress.

Heroin is also something not to be toyed with, I am addicted to it and have struggled for years now with it. I reall, really hope, one of these times it will stick, it's insanely hard to quit and don't ever tell yourself that you will just try shooting it once to see how it feels and then you never will again. What will actually happen is you will now shoot every single time you do it, the only exception would be if you took a tolerance break for like a year or more and then you might start back snorting it but as soon as you ran out of money to snort it you would shoot again.

Sorry for how long this was, I hope it wasn't too rambly but I do believe I failed at my objective of making every paragraph worth reading but I hope some people were able to enjoy. Anyone who already shoots and does these drugs who hasn't done this kind of combo, I highly recommend it haha.

It is diluting this SubReddit.  Not into people new to opiates but new to drugs in general.  I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that most people don't start using opiates by trying Poppy Seed Tea.  That is, unless you don't have any connects, for any drugs.  And the only way you get high is by ordering shit off the internet and obviously they are not smart enough to use DarkNet services. Otherwise, they would be able to get better opiates.   Next they'll start asking about Oregano, Nut Meg, and Banana Peels.

Stop entertaining these idiots and down vote the shit out of them.   Its really are only course of action.  Unless the mods edit the rules.

Just a little background info, had a lot of health issues as a kid, got everything from vikes to percs, iv morphine and shots of Demerol, along with some muscle relaxers. Started dabbling with opiates in the last few years after the symptoms of a few adult onset conditions began. I never really tell my docs how bad things actually get and so tramadol is the only painkiller I get legitimately. I stumbled across kratom a couple years back and that works better for me than the trams anyway.

Anyway, recently moved across my state and found a decent connect here. Unfortunately I didn't realize how the kratom affected my tolerance. 5mg oxy used to do me good but now I can eat 40mg without a good nod. About a month ago I tried snorting dillies. Never sniffed anything before this and wasn't too impressed initially. However I gave it another shot and now it's a full blown love affair. Been doing upwards of 24mg most days. I know, I know, shooting is the best. But my veins are hard enough for a professional to hit and despite reading up on it a ton, I'm just not confident enough to try. And just with sniffing the dillies, I've been able to walk and do stuff every single day without fearing I'll be bedridden the next day because I overdid it. 

So my new guy had a couple fent patches, 50 and 100s, the gel kind. My tolerance has been creeping up slowly. I'm curious about these patches. Checked out a fent conversion chart and with my recent dilly habit, it said the 50 would be a proper match. I don't have much confidence with rubbing some of the gel on my gums or smoking it. How likely am I to fall out if I just stick one on and wear it like it's meant to be? I figure three pain free days might be worth the price. Can you wear them for a little bit then take them off for some time? Any thoughts? Thanks for any helpful advice, y'all. Happy nods to all!",1420957543.0

I mean of course I know the dangers of combining the two classes, just wondering because of it's half life and accumulation if longer acting benzos are no no's but maybe etiz, alprazolam ? 

I always try to go a day at least without my prescribed dose (1-2 mg/ day for years) if I've got something heavy because there was a time during the summer I fell out twice with the exact same fent powder, exact volumetrically metered dose in solution not suspension and two times out of 50 I fell out like literally just woke up face smashed in the floor laying on my arm it's mad asleep. Came to on my own was wondering if this is an ""od"" in the same sense of the word or just like anesthetic properties ie putting me to sleep like after too much k i.v. or I assume od is the latter without help breathing?

 I don't know I figured if I od'd I wouldn't wake up like sometimes 15-20 min later just like "" wtf, there's the rig sticking up out of the carpet. Must've fell out"" so I got it out and rinsed but not capped is how quick it happened. 
Anyway I believe the two times were due to some residual klonopin in my system like I never took any ks on days I would use the fent. It's kind of scary being addicted heavily to benzos that line between getting enough residual out of my system to safely use, without seizing up from too little but makes it much too dangerous to take any before doing your fent. Is there a safer way to do this I suppose it's in the adjustment of dose of fent but what's the crazy pharmacological equation that you enter variables of dosage amount and weight in kg and you enter half life of said drug and supposed to tell you pretty close to what's in your system. I assume anesthesiologists use it to determine the exact dosage to keep you out for X time. Been ten years since pharmacokinetics lol,If anyone knows the name of that formula let me know.

i weighed the stamp -- came out to about .03 g. how does this roughly relate to, say, oxy? would, roughly, one stamp of #4 be roughly? like, maybe a rough equivalent to a 30mg oxy or two?

[my personal feeling is that one stamp is about 50mg of oxy give or take]

i have a few questions i'm going to post about...

What I liked at first was the stimulant and euphoric effect of the drug. I never was after the ""nod"" as my main goal is to get productive and get stuff done while feeling amazing.

Back when I started, only a 10mg pill could get me going for at least 4h and I was feeling great. I have progressively increased my dosage and now i'm at 60mg and it barely give me the energy of a cup of coffee. I'm aware of the tolerance so i have tried even higher dose but the problem with higher dose is that I automatically switch to the OxyRage state. I end up overly agressive and impatient and it sucks for everyone around me.

To those who didn't read it, tl;dr version is that a cancer patient I'm care taking for had begun showing signs of addiction. I alerted her sons to the possibility of addiction and harming her already weak kidneys and was ignored and told to give her the pills anyway...

So Friday, I went to her house as usual. She had on a day old 50 MCG fentanyl patch and asked for her dilaudid pill. It had been four hours so I gave her one. She then sent me out to run her errands. When I returned, I noticed that her pill bottle was not where I left it. Four hours later, she did not ask for a pill which is unlike her. When I left that night, she was happy, chatty and getting around quite well (for using a walker).

Yesterday night I received a frantic call from her son who she lives with. When I got there he explained that she had pretty much been asleep mostly since Saturday night. She would not even get up to use the bathroom even when he offered help. He also informed me that she'd fallen in the kitchen and hit her head on the floor. I was kinda shocked that he hadn't taken her to the ER. I took her vitals, helped her to the bathroom, cleaned up the entire contents of her bladder and bowels that she'd relieved while nodded out, put her in clean pajamas and helped her back to her chair. Her son said he had no clue why she was so out of it. He also mentioned that she hadn't even asked for her pills. I strongly urged him to take her to the ER, but he said no, he didn't want to put her back in the hospital so soon. I was pretty furious but it wasn't my call to make.

This morning I came to her house like normal only to discover her in the same position I left her in and the recliner soaked in urine. Since the son was at work I decided to take her to the doctor and called my grandmother for help getting this lady to the car. I was very worried since she couldn't keep her eyes open for more than a couple seconds and wasn't even able to hold her head up. She said that her chest hurt so we floored it.

I told the triage nurse that she complained of chest pain and that she had been pretty much unresponsive the whole weekend and had fallen and hit her head. Instantly they took her to a room and we watched five people working on getting her in a gown and trying to talk to her. I handed them a list of her medications. Somehow they knew what was wrong. Someone came in with a dose of narcan and gave it to her. Immediately her eyes opened wide and she started trying to push all the nurses and techs away. 

The ER doc said that she was heavily over medicated and that the narcotics had affected her kidneys. And since her kidneys were not working 100% the level of pain medicine was building in her system nearly to the point of overdosing. He said if we'd waited another day she may not have woken up at all. I watched her for hours moaning and writhing in agony. I guess the narcan put her into withdrawals. The poor woman was so out of it that she called out for her mother and husband (both are dead). My grandmother was in tears and had to leave the room.

Eventually her son showed up. He told the nurses and doctor that ""they had no idea she was hooked on the pills and that this would never happen again."" I felt sick to my stomach. I tried to tell them my own personal opinion as well as what her primary care doctor said about the amount of medication being toxic to her. Their response was to call the doc an asshole and for me to continue giving her the pills. And it came to this. She didn't deserve this. And if her family had trusted me, this may not have happened.",1421125736.0

I've been lurking this sub for awhile, and only just started posting like a week ago, so you can consider it my introduction thread, if you will.

I've been doing drugs for a long time. I found my love for them around 14, and my goal through my teen years was to do every psychoactive drug available, and I put a good effort towards that. My partners in psychotropic exploration were basically my brothers; they've been my best friends since we were all about 4, and remained best friends for over two decades now. And we've done TONS of drugs together.

I always had an affinity for narcotics, and faced a couple minor addictions so low-level narcotics (5/500 hydro mostly) early. I hadn't done any in a couple years when my then-roommate and cousin died. We were incredibly close, and one of my pseudo-brothers came and stayed with me for a week to make sure I was okay. He also brought along some heroin and a new connect for it.

Fast forward a year now, and I'm fully dependent. After both my buddies got caught by their families and loved ones, they basically forced us three to have no contact with each other anymore. Then, out of the blue one of my buddies hit me up asking if I could get him some BTH. I should have said no, that he should stay/get clean, but he offered to give me a couple points. It's easy to bribe an addict. Of course he got caught by his wife not even three hours later. I get a text from her saying ""Really PCsNBaseball? Really?"" and a text from him, ""Got caught dude. Sorry."" So now she blames me, and I probably won't see him for awhile.

But me, I have no loved ones to force (or help) me get clean. The only one is my dad, and I can't tell him; I work with him as his only employee. I NEED to be there, or else we're *both* fucked. So life goes on. Another day meeting my cool-as-fuck D boy: he does fronts, and I owe him $300, but I'm not running it up further, and not just disappearing on him, so we're cool. Hell, he even gave me a Christmas give of a free gram of BTH.

Now I'm just sitting here in my car after meeting him; I just smoked for the first time since this morning after a LONG day working. Sitting here, alone and lonely. Thanks for being such an awesome haven for a sad, lonely addicts like me, guys. And thanks for reading if you made it this far.",1421121853.0

I started going to Pain Management because my doctor didn't feel comfortable writing scripts for the amount of pain medicine I was on.  He was writing me 15 75mcg Fentanyl Patches, 120 15mg Oxycodone Instant Release, and 120 Tramadol 50mg.

I talked to him and asked if we could up the Fentanyl Patches and that's when he said he wanted to get me into a Pain Management Program.  The first PM visit I went to they had changed me from the 75mcg Fentanyl Patches to MSContin 60mg twice a day and MSContin 30mg once a day, as well as keeping the 120 15mg Oxycodone and my doctor still writes me the Tramadol 50mg script (which I tell them I use it to drive so I don't have to be on the stronger narcotics).

So I go in and out of nowhere, this Physician's Assistant I've only seen twice before tells me that she wants to start lowering my meds.  I tell her that I feel it would be a mistake as the meds I'm on now are just barely managing the pain I have now.  So with less meds, I'll probably be back to being bed-ridden again like I was before I started receiving pain meds.  Well she says she's going to step out and we'll talk about it.  I said ""okay"".  She leaves and after 10 minutes, a nurse comes back and hands me all 3 scripts.  I thought, okay!  I guess she decided to not cut me back after all.

I go to get the scripts filled and realize the bottle is nearly empty.  I stop and I begin looking at my other scripts.  I realized she wrote them for 2 weeks instead of a month.  I was really irritated because I have to drive an hour to get to that office but that also triples the amount of co-pay that I will have to pay.  It was then that I realize that not only did she only write them for 2 weeks, but she also changed the Oxycodone 15mg IRs to 3 times a day instead of 4.

This shit makes no sense to me.  ""He's in a lot of pain so let's cut back on his meds"".  And the shit kicker is that there is no other place to go for pain management in my area.

I'm really at a loss for what to do.  Just changing the Oxycodone to 3 times a day already has me fucked up as I'm forced to take the 3 I'm prescribed and take them during the day so I can function with my kids and then I'm fucked at night as I don't have enough to take at night so I end up not being able to sleep because of the pain.

'This has been a novel about some people who were punished entirely too much for what they did. They wanted to have a good time, but they were like children playing in the street; they could see one after another of them being killed -- run over, maimed, destroyed -- but they continued to play anyhow. We really all were very happy for a while, sitting around not toiling but just bullshitting and playing, but it was for such a terrible brief time, and then the punishment was beyond belief: even when we could see it, we could not believe it. For example, while I was writing this I learned that the person on whom the character Jerry Fabin is based killed himself. My friend on whom I based the character Ernie Luckman died before I began the novel. For a while I myself was one of these children playing in the street; I was, like the rest of them, trying to play instead of being grown up, and I was punished. I am on the list below, which is a list of those to whom this novel is dedicated, and what became of each.

Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call that not a disease but an error in judgment. When a bunch of people begin to do it, it is a social error, a life-style. In this particular life-style the motto is ""Be happy now because tomorrow you are dying,"" but the dying begins almost at once, and the happiness is a memory. It is, then, only a speeding up, an intensifying, of the ordinary human existence. It is not different from your life-style, it is only faster. It all takes place in days or weeks or months instead of years. ""Take the cash and let the credit go,"" as Villon said in 1460. But that is a mistake if the cash is a penny and the credit a whole lifetime.

There is no moral in this novel; it is not bourgeois; it does not say they were wrong to play when they should have toiled; it just tells what the consequences were. In Greek drama they were beginning, as a society, to discover science, which means causal law. Here in this novel there is Nemesis: not fate, because anyone of us could have chosen to stop playing in the street, but, as I narrate from the deepest part of my life and heart, a dreadful Nemesis for those who kept on playing. I myself, I am not a character in this novel; I am the novel. So, though, was our entire nation at this time. This novel is about more people than I knew personally. Some we all read about in the newspapers. It was, this sitting around with our buddies and bullshitting while making tape recordings, the bad decision of the decade, the sixties, both in and out of the establishment. And nature cracked down on us. We were forced to stop by things dreadful.

If there was any ""sin,"" it was that these people wanted to keep on having a good time forever, and were punished for that, but, as I say, I feel that, if so, the punishment was far too great, and I prefer to think of it only in a Greek or morally neutral way, as mere science, as deterministic impartial cause-and-effect. I loved them all. Here is the list, to whom I dedicate my love:

To Gaylene	deceased
To Ray	deceased
To Francy	permanent psychosis
To Kathy	permanent brain damage
To Jim	deceased
To Val	massive permanent brain damage
To Nancy	permanent psychosis
To Joanne	permanent brain damage
To Maren	deceased
To Nick	deceased
To Terry	deceased
To Dennis	deceased
To Phil	permanent pancreatic damage
To Sue	permanent vascular damage
To Jerri	permanent psychosis and vascular
damage
...and so forth.

In Memoriam. These were comrades whom I had; there are no better. They remain in my mind, and the enemy will never be forgiven. The ""enemy"" was their mistake in playing. Let them all play again, in some other way, and let them be happy.'

I remembered how it brought out my passion and creativity, and made me feel more in tune with myself and the world. Ah... those were the days. But now I am glad to no longer be a slave to addiction. Some PST once in awhile is good enough for me now.

Anyway, back to the question. We all enjoy this, but sometimes that comes at a terrible price.

I just wanted to take a sec to say hey an give my two cents. I have always loved the community here and the interesting stories you guys have to tell. For all you people staying clean, keep going! 

I started dabbling with opiates fairly late. Around 18. Started popping 5mg Percs after work, to 20mg oxys all day everyday to snorting dope to slamming dope as a ""functioning addict"" to doing speed balls and being a useless junky. I chip now. 2 months ago I quit the daily hustle. I can't do withdrawal and I know I will never obtain the things I want in life using daily. 

I have used twice in the past 2 months. 2 shots each time. I crave a speedball something fierce but have had too many psychotic episodes from speed. (Great story if interested) Anyways, I heard someone on here mention they get by using the ""ill use tomorrow, not today"" method. This fucking works. I have managed to go from daily use to like once a month using this. I don't think I'll ever be 100% clean but I know I'm not gonna use today.

It has primarily been daily use (for pain 75% of the time and pleasure 25% of the time). The max perc I would take daily is 15mg (for those days when the pain is bad), I am usually at 5-10mg (if 10, I take 5 at a time). Up until the last two months, I could go a week straight without any when I would be working (I work one week on, one week off). But the last two months, I've had increasing pain and have been having to take vic or perc at work at least part of that week (just 5mg of either). 

Fast forward to today when I have been without perc for 10 days due to stupid vendors on the dnm. But during the past few days I was able to get some vic and have been taking 10mg-15mg/day since. It has had very little effect on me, but takes the edge off. I am not feeling well, a bit nauseous, headaches, fatigue. Could I be going through some withdrawals? I am exposed to sick people at work, so I may be battling the flu, but my long use of pills has me concerned. 

Due to my pain issues, I will need to take something most days until I have surgery or find a fix for my weird pain issues. Should I try to go back to one week of pills, one week off, or similar? Maybe one week of perc, the week of work I stick to vics, if I need something. 

For what it's worth, I can still take 5-10mg of perc and have good pain relief. I have not increased my dose above that unless I am having extreme pain.

I've recently lost my job and house so while I'm working back up, we've been broke as a motherfucker. 

Luckily, she has a pussy. I read on here that selling panties is a very lucrative business opportunity. So Craigslist we go. In less than an hour there were dudes literally lined the fuck up to buy her used and nasty ass panties. Each dude brought about 30-80 bucks and when you're poor that's like a gold mine. A lot of these dudes are good looking and rich but they just have a weird ass fetish. Which is fine I understand that.  Except for this one dude. 

We met up with him and they go into the bathroom at a ghetto ass Kroger (kroghetto). He asks her to piss in his mouth. She stands on the toilet while his head is in the bowl looking up. It goes all over his chest and face but most of it goes in his mouth. He drinks it and asks her to shit on him. Which couldn't happen because she hadn't shit in like three days because daily heroin usage. Unfortunately we only got $30 out of him but it was definitely a stepping stone of ""what will you do to get heroin"". Which is anything. I'll do almost anything. 

Haha have dudes lined up for tomorrow too. If you have a pussy and are tight on cash, sell those dirty things. Usually, the nastier the better. The only thing I don't like is what the dudes say afterwards, like trying to negotiate her fucking them or some other creepy shit, but that can be dealt with.

I took 15 mg, then 20 minutes later another 5 mg, on a relatively empty stomach. I waited several hours but didn't feel anything pleasurable. Didn't feel anything really except maybe increased drowsiness.

I am on an anti-depressant (Zoloft), and an anti-psychotic (Risperidone), which probably effects the high in some way. I discussed this on the /drugs sub a bit and some people say it would reduce the effects, others say it wouldn't.

I just wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience. Has anyone on an SSRI been able to experience pleasant feelings on oxy? 

Next time I'm going to try not taking my medications for a day leading up, but I'm not sure if that will make any difference.

Am I expecting too much? I thought there would at least be a moment where I was like, ""Wow, this feels nice,"" but I never got that. Maybe I'm over-thinking it. 

Any advice on how I can get oxy to work for me? Do I just need to take a higher dose because I'm on those other medications? Maybe snorting it would give me more of what I'm looking for?

I just want to compare notes.,"Hi. I have a few questions that I've been meaning to ask in comments but I haven't come across any relevant posts so I figured I would just submit one.

1. There are tons of posts about being constipated but does anyone have issues with peeing? I feel like I have to pee every 20 to 30 minutes and when I sit down to do it, sometimes it takes forever to get going and even though I feel like my bladder is full, I'll only get a few drops or nothing at all. I am a 31 year old woman and I pee like an elderly man. It freaks me out.

2. We all know that oxys and hydros can cause nausea but does anyone else feel worse after they smoke a cigarette? I can be mildly nauseated,  smoke and feel a million times worse. This is especially true when I'm on fentanyl. 

3. Do you guys ever get anxiety or panic attacks just from focusing on something for a while? To give an example,  I was just laying in bed while playing a word search game on my tablet and I had to shut the game off because I started to feel almost manic while focusing on the words.  It doesn't happen often and I don't know if it's just my anxiety issues or if it's related to oxycodone or fent. I'll be doing something simple and relaxing and then all of a sudden I'm panicked and obsessive for no reason whatsoever.",1421208128.0

Literally ruining his life and need help getting him straightened out.,"I'm not familiar with suboxone beyond that it's used to ween people off harder drugs. It's also apparently very cheap on the street. I have a family member that claims to be addicted to it; it's the only drug he admits to taking. 

He's lost two jobs because of this, dropped out of school twice. He has no prospects, no references, no car, very little money. He's essentially on the verge of either being homeless, dead, or something along those lines. My family has helped him out for years and years but at this point, no one knows what else to do with him. This has been an on-going issue for at least 6 or 7 years now. 

He's very deceptive and manipulative. I can't even be sure if he's even taking suboxone to be honest but it's all I know. He claims to be working, yet has been jobless for months. Or claims to be going to school but hasn't shown up in months. It's been a never ending struggle.

2saxom,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2saxom/meth_much_more_than_once/,37,https://redd.it/2saxom,Pushoffslow,"Meth, much more than once.","I decided I'm gonna share my story of temporary psychosis brought on by my girlfriend of four years going on vacation and me being alone in her house with a ball of speed and not enough dope to come down.

So our story begins in a small town in Alberta where I resided at the time, a shithole. This town was plagued with speed but finding down (heroin) was literally impossible, not to mention frowned upon by the tweakers. I believe the speed was so popular due to all the rig workers with long hours and longer bank accounts. Luckily at the time I was getting a ball of down and a ball of speed brought to me weekly. I would sell the speed to pay for the dope and use all the dope. Didn't have much experience with speed. Smoked it, hated it. Snorted it, hated it more.... Then one day I slammed it. WOOH. I remember taking my shirt off and telling my girl I was gonna die. A good speed rush legit makes your heart feel like its gonna come out your chest. It gets hard as fuck to breath for a sec then you're wired. I paced around the room eventually going from ""I'm gonna die"" to ""I get why people do speed now, this is living"" 

Now I dabbled with speed here and there after that, mostly when we ran out of dope to stave off withdrawal (BEST THING FOR WD IMO) 

Fast forward to the day before my girl leaves on vacation, we're doing dope, smoking weed and chilling out. The next day, the morning she leaves, We have a fresh ball of speed and only a couple gs of dope. We divide the dope and I keep the speed so I can sell it and buy more dope for when she's back. Mistake #1. So cooking up the last shot we would do together I accidentally give her my speed ball. I bet she loved that 10 hour drive tweaking da fuck out hahah. Her parents and her leave and I hop in the vehicle they wanted me to move for them. I go to Tim hortons to avoid suspicion and head back to the house. 

Now having shit the bed on my first speedball and giving it to my girl, I prep myself another one. A speedball to dwarf all other speedballs. Now I'm still not overly cultured about speed but this shit was a little moist and still the best speed I've done. So I do that speed ball, all is well. Spend the day tweaking out, doing dope shots just generally living large. At one point the next day I decide there is too many maggots(yes, brain maggots) in my girlfriends room to continue chilling in there and start moving all my ""supplies"" to another room covered in windows. If you have ever tweaked hard you know windows suck. Anyways, ladida doing shots of dope shots of speed living it up. 

All the sudden my brain snaps. I believe cops are outside the house conversing on how they can enter. The cop I actually remember seeing was that fat bald cop from  ""the shield"" the main character I think. I don't know why this wasn't a red flag to my amphetamine riddled mind that I was hallucinating but it wasn't. We have a big talk about how I'll take the blame for all the drugs in the house as long as my girl doesn't get in trouble and shit. I remember I kept trying to plead with him to let me do one more dope shot before I went to jail so I didn't get sick right away. Lol. This is a hallucination I'm talking to. This whole time I am hearing voices from my girls whole family, from her and the cops. I truly thought I was being raided. Eventually after a substantial talk with her dad (also a hallucination) he tells me to go wait outside for the cops. So as I'm sitting outside of an empty house I think is being raided my buddy pulls up. He wants to buy some weed. I say sure get me da fuck outta here and we drive off. I explain to him what's happening and ask to use his phone. I call my girlfriend and ask her why her parents came home early. She says they didn't. We go smoke a joint as my brain is twisting and turning with confusion. They drop me back off at the house because I was freaking them the fuck out. Realizing now I wasn't being raided I continue doing shots of speed. Mistake #2

 I decide to go roam the town. Mistake #3 I think that I am going to meet my girl at the park but really I'm just tweaking around the town looking sketchy as all fuck. I spen the whole night following this guy I thought was trying to get me to follow him. There was no guy. I kept walking up to empty vehicles because I thought someone was in it offering me a ride. I'm hearing voices saying some mean shit this whole time. Like the voices are calling me out on everything I am embarrassed about in life. I come up to this apartment building an for some reason think my girl is in the top floor trying to drop heroin down to me. So I'm like under this window looking for heroin that she's dropping. Lol. I think the whole town is trying to keep my girlfriend from me so I'm like yelling at people and shit while doing this. I'm surprised it took the real cops as long as it did to show up. Like I said small town so they knew me. The cop gets out gun drawn tells me to drop to my knees. I do it but tell him he has to find my heroin before we leave. He comes and slaps the cuffs on. As soon as the cuffs click I have the most overwhelming need to piss. I try to stand and whip it out but he throws me to the ground. I ended up pissing in the back of his cop car. While driving to the station he's asking me if I'm gonna give him a hard time. I say ""just get me a glass of water and let me take this shirt off and ill do anything you want man"" while in holding I believe doctors are examining me and shit. (They weren't) I try swindling them outta some methadone. Didn't work hahahah. I somehow fall asleep and wake up to  a ""hungry man"" chicken finger meal. Sooo good. Eventually they let me go even after finding rigs loaded up an ready to slam in my back pack. Like I said, they knew me. They were baffled at the fact I touched meth. I give em the classic adolescent addict tale and go on my way. I remember him handing me the shit from my pockets, 60$ and a bunch of rig lids and qtips. I said well that won't get me far will it? He laughed knowing I could copp a g of meth for that 60. On the walk from station to the house I bump into my girls friend who gives me a smoke and a ride to the house. These girls were super chill with me and like stayed at the house with me till I felt better. I'm still hearing these terrible voices cutting me down though. When they leave I call my nigga and ask him to come chill. We go to mcdonalds, the river, and all kinds of other places where I was 100% sure someone was following us and being mean to my brain. We go out to his place because I'm not down with being in that house alone. His house is in the middle of nowhere. I spend the night stumbling around on his farm talking to people who i think are in the woods and shit. I then go back in the house, slap him full bore in the face while he sleeps in bed. Im convinced at this point he's working for the people in the trees trying to get me to confess to killing someone. He's super chill about the situation. Drives me home in the morning and what not. This is in the span of like 2 days. I get home to no speed, no dope and one dirty roach. I continued hearing the voices for about a week after that. Everywhere I went. And even though I knew it was the speed, I was convinced a group of people were following me around tryna ruin my life. Still hear em sometimes. I have snapped since, sober as a goat and went into paranoid delusions where I actually completely lose it again. 

There's even more fucked up shit that happened throughout this episode that I left out because I either forgot or didn't wanna try and explain the dark things my brain was feeling.

TL;DR Did a ball of speed in two days via IV and completely lost my mind going into paranoid delusions and states of complete psychosis. Got arrested. Voices still pop up once in a while. Don't do meth.",1421172299.0

Long time lurker here. I'm a long time hydro user. I can take 70mg in one dose fairly easy, up to 200mg a day if I want to. Tolerance is quite high. Now, I'm blessed with a great doctor that usually keeps me happy. I've got a job that drug tests so I typically stick with hydrocodone. I have a scrip for Oxycodone as well so I'll take that on occassion. 

It's a hobby of mine. I'm an active member of society. I work, have a wife and kids, etc. 

I recently acquired a large sum of meds from a family member that passed away from cancer. I've got loads of morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl patches, and some other stuff.

Here's my question. First off, I might consider taking this stuff if I was sure it'd pass a 5 panel drug test showing up as either oxy or hydro. But, as my job supports my family, I don't risk it. Someone here might could provide some insight there.

But, to be honest, I'd love to trade that stuff for hydro or oxy as that's what I love. I don't know where to start. First off, I'll flush the shit before I get caught. My family relies on my for food on the table. If I get in trouble, the job goes away. Not an option. I'm not an idiot, I don't plan on getting on craigslist and posting an ad. I'm just curious if there's a way to get this done safely. 

It'd be a hell of a deal for someone I'd think. Strong shit for weaker shit. Maybe I'm wrong?

This is why you should test shot all your new sources very carefully.,"I'm catching my breath, bit shaken up. I'll just tell the story. I may be a bit bad with words and have blurry/double vision from the dope, so excuse it if my writing is a bit dodgy in parts. From the amount of time I spend on this sub whilst I'm high, I should be pretty well-practised in seeing through dope-vision. Anyway.

I buy my heroin from the darknet. I have no irl dealers as I'm socially inept and a likely Aspergers case. This isn't particularly relevant to this story, but I'm just saying it as an explanation of why I find the darknet so preferable and convenient.

The vendor I've bought from for a while now is based in the UK (as am I) and guarantees next-day delivery, and follows through with it and is very good. His dope is average-good quality but the selling point is that you get some gear ASAP which is good if you have none and are gonna be sick. But I decided that I would take the chance at finding some better and/or cheaper gear by broadening my search and considering importing from Europe. I found a vendor in the Netherlands who offered a product for quite a bit cheaper than my usual go-to. So I went ahead and ordered a gram.

First thing I noticed when I received the gear was that it looked lighter in colour than my usual; it was a lighter shade of brown. I don't really know for sure if that could be an indicator of purity, because we all know dealers are known to mix all sorts of different cuts in for various effects and such. 

I got home this afternoon and as is my usual routine, I went to mix up a shot. Instead of going and using some of the remaining bag I had left, I decided to give the new stuff a try. I weighed out 60mg - which is less than I'd usually take if I wanted a shot to get me good and high. Right now, I'm realising how *fucking lucky* it is that I purchased a good set of milligram scales that were on sale a few weeks ago. Prior to that, I was just eyebaling small amounts, which was a fucking stupid thing to be doing.

I digress. I do the usual routine: weighed the gear, add a spot of vit c, add half a syringe of water, cook up, draw up, tie off, stab, draw back, smile as that familiar, beautiful plume of blood fountains into the mixture..., move my arm a bit awkwardly to loosen the tie (bit of rubber tubing) and let it fall down. I started pushing the plunger and noticed I started to feel that nice 'buzz' sooner than usual; when only about half of the liquid had entered my vein. I eagerly went and pushed the rest in, then as I flushed back a little to get the last bits, I noticed I felt a bit odd. I pushed the rest of the stuff in my arm, but I was aware by now of how the world seemed to be getting quiet.

I can't say for sure whether I sat down on the floor myself because I felt dizzy, or if I fell, but when I came to, I was lying on the floor of my bedroom, drooling. By some miracle, I found myself lying in an approximation of the recovery position, which could have been the thing that saved my ass tonight. What makes me think that I collapsed unwillingly though, is that the rig was still sticking in the crook of my right arm. I promptly pulled it out, and took a deep breath. I grabbed my phone and checked the time - I don't know the exact time when I shot, but I couldn't have been out for more than a couple of minutes. I took my time, steadying myself and moved over to sit on the bed, where I am now, writing this as a warning to everyone to **test all your new sources - and be extremely careful and cautious even when doing those small test shots!!**

Praise Junkie Jesus for giving me a second chance today. I'm alone in the house - I dread to think of how badly this could have gone wrong. Just a little story/warning for you guys. Safe nods. :)



**tldr;** Got dope from a different source. Shit was fire and I collapsed with a rig still in my arm. By some miracle, I came around within minutes. Test shot all yo new sources, guys.",1421167330.0

I'll call it ""WHY DON'T YOU RESPECT ME!?""","Last summer I was getting this killer dope.  That's kind of a pun because my buddy fell out on it but it was also really fucking good if used in moderation.  However, it was a small town connect so I had to go through 2 middlemen which meant usually gas money and getting less than what I paid.  Middle man one...let's call him Austin was the worst.  I've never liked him really but he could get the best dope so...yeah.  anyways the connect gets busted and it was time to re up and find a new dude.  My best friend knew a guy in Chicago he could get crazy amounts from so we decided to make a trip which is about 8 hrs round trip due to it being friday and us arriving during rush hour.  The week before my friend gets fired and the car breaks down so we need to find a driver.  Good ole Austin was down to drive if I threw some his way which I didn't mind.  We agreed on 8 bags.  In fact Austin suggested 8 and I said deal.  Everything was smooth sailing until we got the dope.  I spent 500 dollars and told my best friend (let's call him hayden from now on) we would just get fucked up all weekend because I wanted to do something nice for my bro who fell on hard times.  I was expecting 50 stamps for 500 but I ended up getting 65.  We stopped by a CVS to buy rigs since you can get them no questions asked and then each of use did a bag. We were all content and high...except for austin.  He demanded to do another one and wanted his shit but I already had it stashed and said wait till we get back.  He was clearly high btw kept nodding off as he was bitching about not being that high and his nodding made me nervous and we needed to fuel up so I suggested stopping for gas and hayden would drive the rest of the way home.  At this point, I should mention at the beginning of this adventure I had a full pack of newports but Austin kept bumming off of me and I had maybe 7 left and I smoke more when I'm high so I had enough to atleast get back to Indiana so I wouldn't have to pay an 10 dollars for another pack.   We get to this gas station and Austin wants me to buy him a pack of smokes or up the amount of bags I gave him to 15 because ""it not fair to give him 8 because I got so much extra.""  I tell him to fuck off and he says he'll pay me back if I do and I say alright and hand him a 20 and tell him to bring me change.   Austin decides to bring me back 2 dollars and come back either cigs junk food a bottle of water and one of those Arizona canned teas. I'm like ""wtf man"" but he says he'll give me 20 when I'm back so I'm just say fine.  We are about to leave when Austin says he won't let hayden drive and won't take us any further unless we give him 12 bags and let him do one.  I give him 8 and tell him I'll take a goddamn greyhound before I let him do that to me.  He backs off and takes his 8 (technically 9 since we each did one already) and proceeds to pour out the tea in the middle of the gas station and rip the can up to make a spoon in front of everyone and walks in the station to the bathroom with it.  I'm afraid he's gonna fall out or get caught but he doesn't and we head back home.  Hayden notices Austin isn't wearing his seat belt and politely asks him to put it on just in case and Austin fights him about it saying it's his car Yada Yada. We are about 20 mins from home when hayden just loses it.  He starts screaming at Austin calling a fucking irresponsible greedy idiot and after this they aren't friends anymore.  I mean he laid into Austin and I'm trying to hold back laughter and I was succeeding until Austin started crying.  Now you know when you're a little kid and get so upset you cry and tend to repeat yourself over and over?  Well Austin was balling his eyes out and kept yelling ""WHY WONT YOU RESPECT ME!""  I started crying toom..tears of laughter and it makes him more upset and did we get him to calm down and explain we were just trying to be careful.  We get back to Austins house where his meth head brother is waiting for us but he doesn't say or do much however has a reputation for stealing shit (meth and stealing..who would have thought? Lol).  We go inside cuz crybaby needs another fucking shot before driving us to haydens house. The totals are hayden and I 1 bag and Austin 3.  The mother fucking asshole passes out on us.   We were first worried he OD'd but nope just tired and nodding.  At this point, Austin had taken 20 dollars from me, threatened and tried get more than our agreed deal.  Now he was going to make us walk across town home.  So while passed out I stuck my hand in his pocket and took his 6 remaining bags and left.  I get a call a few hours later.  Austin begs me for a couple free bags because he meth head brother stole his i say I'll sell him one for 20.  We meet up i take his 20 and ask him for 20 more.  He gets extremely shitty with me but eventually gives him.  I hand him half of a normal bag and since they're stamps i knew he could tell it wasn't full.  finally he just said thanks and sulked away.  We don't hang out much anymore and i definitely do not respect him.",1421331694.0
2sig5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2sig5m/i_new_users_intro/,23,https://redd.it/2sig5m,allinallisallwear,I new users intro!,"Hello there /r/opiates!
I have been a lurker for about a month or two, as I had never even really fully known about reddit, let alone this beautiful sub with a community that is full of very kind, understanding people from all walks of life.

So, after much thought and debate I decided to finally make an account to share my past, present and future experiences with my current love and  DOC: opiates!

So, since this is a kind of intro I would like to tell you a bit about myself, and so this post isn't a complete waste is space and so I can actually get some views and meet people I will include my beginning in the world of opiates.

I was born and raised in a fairly known Manitoba town in the cold ass of Canada. I would say I grew up with a fairly average family and had a pretty decent life all things happening to my family and I considered(I will eventually get to just about everything, I have been told I should write my experiences )

I have been into opiates since I was about 12 or so. Now I wasn't even fully aware about opiates, all I knew was it was a pill that made me feel wonderful!
I have grown up with a few different illnesses that have cause me a considerable amount of pain and discomfort growing up and so my family (mother, father and grandmother on moms side(all very functional addicts in their own right) would see me in distress and five me a half a pill/whole pill and without telling me what it was just tell me to take it and lay down.
It wasn't long before I realized that I was being given oxy. It would either be just the basic generic 5mg pervs or I would get a 1/4 to half a 40mg of generic oxycontin from my grandmother. Her and I were close, she sympathized with the pain I was having at such an age but now, given what I have gone through and know, I do not think it was right of her to give a child such a powerful narcotic. It basically paved the way for my future addiction.

Pretty soon I figured out that it I said I was in pain even when I wasn't, I could get oxy from my grams or dad, who had just started taking oxy for his pain issues. My mom would just get percs, T3s and clonazepam, which she would call valium. So by the time I was 14 I was being medicated by my parents and or grandparent more then I was sober.
It didn't take long for me to know I loved the feeling opiates gave me and really began to abuse them. My father ended up getting a higher and higher dosage till he pretty much nodded from one script to the next so it was easy for me to steal. My mother slept more then she was awake so it was easy to get to her meds as well, I already kind of knew I was addicted to opiates but at the age I was I didn't even fully understand addiction. 
So I kept getting 40s from grams and steals from mom and dad. By the tim I got to high school, well, I was nodding more then not but I had never touched another drug. In my mind pharms weren't drugs. Weed, heroin, coke, ecstasy etc were the drugs! And I would not go near them. 

That's where I'll end it now. Feel free to ask me questions as at the moment I have an abundance of free time and I am always on my phone. But also forgive any spelling grammatical errors I may have made.",1421328230.0

I was iving within the month. We started fighting constantly after I started using because now that I used with him he went from a once every 2 month user to a twice a week user. we had to drive 2.5 hours to get it, but I drove because of his dui. and I paid because he didn't have a job. needless to say this caused issues. not to mention the depression that hit us both being bipolar and unmedicated going through withdrawls. we took turns going into the psych hospital for suicidal thoughts and actions. me first then him. when I was in the hospital I went because I lost my job my home and my dog through a series of bad luck unrelated to dope. Matthew broke up with me because he couldn't handle my ""negativity"" aka my bad luck and depression.  he completely abandoned me mid withdrawls in the psych ward with no friends or family . I get out of the facility a week and a half later to being homeless living out of my car and I'm sober. we end up getting back together and start using again because he can't stop even though I beg him, tell him it's the reason we fight so bad. he goes to the psych, blames everything on me, even though I've busted my ass to be a loyal supportive and loving partner. he becomes emotionally abusive. then physically abusive via a car, slamming on the breaks and swerving so I hit the door and the dashboard with my head.....all because I was holding the dope and he wanted it, again he had no job and I bought and own all the dope, doesn't matter he wants it. I get mad,I say take me home,  i don't talk to him the entire next day, he posts all over Facebook WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU? but he doesn't call or text me. the next day he calls me from the psych,  he's back in because he slit his throat because I didn't call him all day. we break up because he blames me for his suicide attempt. a month goes by. we don't talk. I miss him. I love him. I think about him. he calls me to come over Christmas eve. says he wouldn't rather spend the holiday with anyone else. Begs me spend the night. we sleep together. the next day he takes me to surgery. after surgery when I'm all fucked up and incoherent he says I don't love you we will never be together. leaves me all fucked up not knowing what's going on. two weeks later I text him.  I miss you. I love you. he says let's be friends with benefits. I cry. I remember when he was the sweetest kindest man in the world who loved me and made me laugh. we played beautiful music together . now he wants to get high. I spend 100 on dope bring it to his house get him high. he says it's not good enough. he says he's over me. he says the only reason he's leading me on is so I don't kill myself. I cry. he says he doesn't want me out of his life. let's just be friends with benefits until I want a relationship again. I swear I won't hook up with anyone but you. I cry and say fine. next day he calls and says let's make a trip. I'll buy. I said ok. I drove his ass 2.5hrs plus 2.5 hours to sit in silence while he listened to headphones and texted other girls. he tells me, when we slept together Christmas eve I wanted to get you pregnant. I cry and cry. why don't you love me Matthew?  I am loyal to you like a fucking dog! you beat me you use me you manipulate me and use me and I come back loyal to you. you got me started on heroin. you went from my soul mate to a crazy cold hearted demon. he tells me, I've been sleeping with other girls. he says it nonchalant. he's texting when he says it.

I happened to talk to him the other day and we had a disagreement and wanted to tell you guys about it and see what you think.

So deg (drug expert guy) is doing lots of heroin and slinging it to be able to get high for free.  I happened to be in my hometown and he called me up and we got high.  I paid him 20 bucks and he throw about double what it was worth because we haven't hung out in a while.  However....deg can't hit himself all and needs somebody to find a vien and hit him each time and seeing is how I was around I was given the honor.  So I'm about to hit myself when he gets super shitty and makes me hit him first.  Well my hands are shaking and I'm trying to get him quick so I can do mine.  He's about so about so still squeemish about  it still so when u have to dig a little he freaks and started screaming in pain.  Of course this is drug expert guy and he needed to be a badass so he punches a hole in his wall because he ""goes full on rage"" (actual thing he says). So during his tantrum I blasted off no problem calmed my nerves and hit him lickity split.  So a few mins go by and deg wants to do more since he's not high enough.  Well around that time a buddy came to deg's house to ask for a front till payday and he says no but he stuck around anyways.  Then deg asks dude he just said no on helping to hit him with heroin.  Other dude says ""you're really gonna show off al your dope and ask me to hit u and you won't break me off at least a little""  deg ends up fronting him they both get high and life is good.  Other guy leaves and deg freaks out on me because A) I couldn't hit him and B) people always ask to be broken off when deg needs assistant.   So I explained to him thay A) you have no business shooting up if you can't do it on your own after a year of using the needle and B) it's cruel to ask somebody to do that when they are broke and in withdrawal. Things escalated and he kept telling me I suck at shooting up (I was soooooo sad to hear it lol) and I just don't get it. It became an agree to disagree sort of convoy and we watched a movie got high and had a somewhat decent time (deg is also a know it all in everything and likes to talk about how smart he is.  So fellow opiate users here is my question. Do you guys think if you travel the path of needle you should be able to hit yourself. Does anybody know a person who has been shooting up for about how year and can't  do it themselves yet?

I usually wait a few weeks or sometimes a month or two between usage (CWE codeine + DHC or just DHC) for 1-3 nights in a row, use a small dose of dxm to prevent tolerance and try not to overdo it to keep it special. 

I'm still able to get what to me is a great nod out of ~250-300mg DHC but I'm worried that trying oxy is going to make my tolerance skyrocket or that it'll be so good that I won't enjoy weaker opiates anymore.

 Okay, first of all, my first experience with opiates was when I was prescribed Vicodin for strep throat. Back then I was way too paranoid to ever take more than one at once. I've always been really afraid of drugs that make you die in your sleep if you overdose because they're usually sedating, and I get paranoid every time I feel like I'm going to fall asleep while on drugs. Because of that, I would always stay awake until my opiate high wore off, and then I'd go to bed. 

 However, I'd like to think that I've overcome that anxiety. I was prescribed percocet for a wisdom extraction, and I would take a couple at once but never in excess like a lot of people do. It wasn't until last Thanksgiving that I finally just popped 10 spread throughout a night, and I had a blast. I had never felt so good from oxys before. I was just playing video games all night, and I damn near won all of them. 

 I killed an entire bottle of oxy in 3 days, and it was the best 72 hours of my life. That was the second time I ever enjoyed an opiate high. The first was when I had the percs for that oral surgery. Anyway, I recently came into some percs, and I took a lot the first time around. However, I really didn't enjoy it at all, and nodding was no fun to me at all. Today is my first time doing oxy again in a couple of days, and I figured that maybe I just didn't like them in high doses so I only took three 5/325 oxys tonight, but it feels just like the first time around. I just feel tired, irritable, and a little hot. 

 Guys, I really don't get it. Are opiates something you need to approach with a good mindset or something? It seems that every time I do them while I'm feeling good to begin with, I enjoy it more. I'll admit that the past month has been pretty damn stressful for me with a car accident, and I didn't live up to my expectations grades-wise last semester. Am I doing it wrong or something? I just want to learn how to appreciate opiates because I come across opiates all the time, and I have a $45 order of Kratom on the way. 

 I really don't want to waste all of these opiates, and I spent a huge portion of my paycheck on Kratom which will be a huge waste if I don't figure out how to enjoy opiates. :( could it be that I'm more into stimulants or something? I came pretty close to getting addicted to amphetamines a couple of years ago. I was only able to stop because I lost all of my contacts for them, and now it just doesn't really appeal to me anymore because their comedowns suck. I'd take an opiate comedown over an amphetamine comedown any day!",1421284170.0

I am a pain patient for ulcerative colitis and also being treated to the aftermath of many surgeries for cancer. I am prescribed Morphine Sulfate 60mg 2x a day and Oxycodone 30mg 4x a day.

Sometimes (very rarely) this combo doesn't cut it, and I have supplemented very occasionally with some black tar heroin. I made a stupid mistake and plugged some black tar heroin with my morphine sulfate (plugging the morphine is the only way I can get it to work and I don't use needles) and then I was drug tested a little more than 25 hours later at my pain clinic.

Now my clinic only uses a 12 panel immunoassay for initial testing so my drug test basically just needs to pop for Opiates, but there is a separate place for Heroin listed.

So I am wondering how much time needs to pass before heroin is completely metabolized into morphine. Some websites say heroin and the metabolites that differentiate it, is only detectable in urine for 8 hours but some websites say heroin is detectable for up to 3 days but I am unsure if it is referring to the morphine metabolites. So I am just hoping someone who is experienced and/or knowledgeable in such matters can clarify how long heroin is identifiable between morphine on a drug test.

And I am never ever touching the heroin ever again!

Thanks in advance for your help.",1421271408.0

(The wd's are coming...),"I'm looking at coming off of about a bundle a day habit that I've been pretty regular with for about...2-3 months at least, with smaller level of usage leading up to that. My bundle is generally around 10 bags of ECP (I know a ""bundle"" can vary by location, local slang, etc). However, the last few days I've been using what I've been told is a G (it's probably less, I have no way to measure) of BTH that isn't very potent at all, whereas the ECP was pretty bangin' for what you can get in my area. 


Anyways, my guy is out of town and the people I have to go through now are nowhere near as nice or understanding as he is. He will always throw me something, even if I have nothing, but these other people aren't like that, they seem to be middlemen anyways. My mom needed some money and I don't think my serving shift tonight is going to make me what I need for any decent amount. If I'm looking at it being about...3-4 days before I can cop again, how badly can I expect to be hurting before all is said and done?


I may be able to grab some hydro 7.5's tomorrow since my script is coming in and some 0.5 Xans. Greenery comes in tomorrow, too, so I should have some things to make it not so horrendous. Best case scenario, I can find some methadone before it gets too bad. Worst case scenario, I can't get my script and my mom will probably give me some hydro's since she doesn't really take hers. But I would just like to have an idea of how bad things might get. TIA.

Since I discovered reddit a couple years ago I've been waking up and reading this sub like the newspaper. Never posted before but I love the community and feel like I can relate more to you guys than most people I interact with in the real world. I guess I have sort of the typical chipper background, did a lot of oxy in highschool along with every other drug I could find and have slowly graduated to heroin. I'm in school so I have to keep my shit together but in the last couple years I've done my fair share of h. But whatever, generic /r/opiates intro. On to the story.


Last weekend I realized I was starting to fuck up with school and relationships and I need to take a break for a while, if not quit for good. I'm actually pretty good with taking these kinds of ""get my shit together"" breaks, but this time there was a problem in the form of a good sized pile of ECP sitting in my room. I wanted to just flush it down the toilet but anyone who has tried heroin knows that wasn't going to happen. That's when my drug addict logic kicked in and I decided that since this was my last time doing heroin I should just rail it all at once, be the highest I've ever been, and then slip back into society forever. A promise I've made many times to myself before and I'm sure I'll make again. Anyway, next thing I know I'm out. I'm nodding out for long periods of time, waking up to gasp for air and vomit before going back under. I know this wasn't a legit OD like the ones I've read about on here but I can't imagine being much closer without waking up in an ambulance. I also know what nodding feels like and this seemed more like dying. Luckily I rode it out and with the help of some xanax I've gotten over my minor withdrawals (I was using fairly heavily leading up to the big dose), but something is still a little weird. Which brings me to my question.

I keep getting this tingling sensation through my body. Sort of like when a shiver goes down your spine, but more electric, like one of those toys that shocks you when you pull the lever. It's not really unpleasant, but it's definitely very weird and throws me off. I've never felt something like this really and now it's happening all the time. Has anyone ever experienced this as part of withdrawals? Could it be some kind of effect from my ""mini-OD""? 

If no one knows what I'm talking about it's whatever, it's pretty minor and I should at least give it a week or so before I start tripping out about it. I mostly just wanted to finally say hi and share a little story. Also just a reminder that you can always do more but you can't do less, we hear this shit all the time but if you're doing opiates these are words to live by. Stay safe and happy nods",1421396684.0

I will try to answer your questions if you have any.,"Hello r/opiates!  I'm an attorney in Austin, Texas, and I'm here to answer legal questions if you have any.  

Of course, there are disclaimers.  **I'm not offering legal advice.**  The reason I (and lawyers in general) must state this is because every situation is different.  It would be irresponsible for me to give advice without knowing all the details about your situation.  I can only speak in generalities.  

Second, if you have any pending legal matters, I want to discourage you from posting the details here (or anywhere online).  I have seen a few posts here that I thought were a little bit irresponsible from a legal perspective.  I interned with a District Attorney, and believe me, social media is a huge resource for them to gather evidence.  Sure, they may not have found your Reddit account, but why take that risk?  If you must include specifics in order to ask your question, feel free to PM me. 

Third, I want to be up front that I am a newly licensed attorney.  Although I am setting up a practice in criminal law, and I focused on criminal law in school, I am not drawing from years of experience.  If there's an answer that I don't know, I will try to look it up for you.  If that's the case, I ask that you have patience.  

Why am I doing this?  I PM'ed with Tracey, and she suggested it may be helpful for some.  I don't use opiates, but I've lurked on this sub, and I find the community interesting.  At the risk of sounding poetic, I've learned a little bit about the human condition from this sub.  

OK, with those disclaimers in mind, ask away.  I hope I can help.

I have a strong love/hate relationship with heroin, and the hate is usually more for the guilt attached to the stigma. I want to use at a university I'm attending in a 9 days. Heroin makes me a better person and my yesterday's college visit kind of gives me proof from an outside perspective...will this be a huge mistake to do? Or should I just stick to my suboxone maintenance and not risk using again? I can hide my habit very well, and I won't let shit spiral out of control. I am not hating life as much like I did in my freshman year.**

Hi everyone. I am having a conflict of interest here... 

I'm 21 years old, started using heroin due to a strong depression/social anxiety that was worsened in my freshman year in college. Was really bad, went straight from oxycontin to heroin less than a month. Didn't even start with vicodin or codeine... 

I was away from home, and lonely, and taking many psychedelics/MDMA and smoking marijuana daily... I started with pot  however due to my binges with rave drugs it made me  extremely paranoid/heavy anxiety for a very long time whenver I would smoke. Since my roommate/former best friend from my high school, was a really big pot enthusiast... it was hard to avoid and it was like I was shooting myself in the foot -.-.... when I first did heroin, I knew this was what I wanted out of a drug. Anxiety fading, stress going away, waves of euphoria, feeling comfortable and not letting things get to me. 


I left after my freshman year with not the best grades (this was not due to the heroin, in fact I performed better on heroin), then went to community college completely clean and got good grades and an associates degree. I'm going to school this spring, and this is a big step in my life.
I am anxious, but also excited. I am not experiencing extremely high anxiety from frequently taking ecstasy and stuff like I was before my freshman year. I am feeling confident, and although I'll know very little people there I hope to find good friends.

 I had been clean from dope for 1.5 years after my freshman year at college thanks to being on suboxone maintenance, and relapsed out of curiosity again in September. Parents found out, were very disappointed, I felt guilty/ashamed, and they fear that I'll hit a rock bottom and worry I'll ruin my life/hit rock bottom/etc.... I haven't yet, when I relapsed it wasn't like I was back at square one, and I am in a tremendous better place now despite the relapse. I used everyday for like 2 months, nobody ever noticing, going to work high and performing well. When my parents I told them I would stop, and then I did but kept coming back... my regime was very different from the one they wanted me to be on, and I've switched back and forth between suboxone and heroin many times since my relapse. Having it is like my safety net, and I find that it doe have therapeutic me too when I'm on sub anways too cause I get energy/feel better. Heroin is just more awesome and euphoric and I haven't had the motivation to quit for myself. I've since been trying out professional drug-treatment for their peace of mind...

I truly believe that opiates make me a better person and more likeable.... my struggle with anxiety has been a very hard battle for me, and I have no life. Never had a girlfriend, left all my rave friends since they were changing, and spend a lot of my time isolated. When I use... I don't care as much, am able to do normal things that would give me anxiety/panic attacks sober, and life is just so much better.

And I have proof from another perspective this time... my very own Dad. On Wednesday and Thursday, I stopped my sub regime and went did dope. Yesterday before driving down to the school, I did some good ecp and made everything easier in seemingly stressful things like this. I was actually cracking jokes/able to not be so socially awkward like I usually am. And this is just an example... 

My Dad and I really enjoyed the school, and think it will be a good fit for me! , but just hearing my Dad say that he was impressed with the school and that I would have no problems making good friends there, from the vibe I was giving out :) was really interesting to hear... since he was oblivious that I was using again...  


Even if I'm doped out, it's not like you did meth or crack. it's very subtle like you all know. It's my perfect drug. Even can be more functional on heroin than weed. Today, I took my sub, and although I was w/ding a bit in the morning when I woke up I feel COMPLETELY FINE. I experienced very little withdrawal too when transitioning from my first relapse (which was 1-2 month binge) to suboxone.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is can I pull off using heroin (not all the time, will do my best to take suboxone also, and the transition isn't awful for me anyways) in college? What do you guys think? I don't think having some heroin handy could be that bad of a problem for me. I don't inject, am satisfied with the high quality #4 we get, and I already have a job worked out there, so I'll be financially stable if I ever wanted to use heroin more than my suboxone. What do you guys think? I want to quit heroin eventually, but I'm not tired of it yet and I'm a more inviting person when I'm on it. I feel like a lot of the stigma on heroin makes it seem so evil, but in my opinion when I respect it it is very therapeutic and makes life.... beautiful.",1421463141.0

So she was very excited with my proposal and we exchanged our telephone digits and I phoned her promptly two days later to inquire about what she was doing on Thursday evening (yesterday)  she informed she was free and we set up a time to get together.

Now I should make it clear that the local bar we became acquainted  at is visited by many patrons who induce their psychosis with opiates and other substances, so surely this girl I figured was all good an well with the scene. We had even discussed Kurt Cobain and I figured that was a fool proof sign.

So I picked her up last night in my Big rig as I am a trucker.  We were driving for about 20 min on our way to the the diner we would be dining at, when I pulled at some stuff to do.  She proceeded to get a horrified and disgusted look upon her face and yelled

""what are you doing!!!!!""

I said right back to her in a calm but agitated voice

""What do you think honey?""

So yesterday i acquired 15 60mg morphine pills for $4 a pop. The guy that i got them from gets them regularly, and im one of his few customers, so im in a pretty good position right now. Anyways.

Every question posted on this subreddit regarding morphine sulfate is always met with the same answer: ""Plug or shoot, or its a waste.""

I don't shoot, and ive tried plugging these before. Not sure if i did it incorrectly or what, but i followed someones posted instructions, plugged around 60mgs, and didnt get much out of the experience. Ive gotten good results with around 180mg crushed and eaten(defeating the time release), but the high seems to last no more than 3 hours tops, and redosing with pills is always unneffective/underwhelming imo. 

So heres my question: Couldn't i just take a higher dose, uncrushed, and receive the same high for longer? Taking advantage of the time release by taking more of them? Would that work, or even be enjoyable? And how many would i have to take to get the desired effects? I understand that its wasteful, but i'm not exactly breaking the bank buying these.

Thanks in advance guys

Edit: After posting i checked out the ""Bioavailability of various opioids"" link in the sidebar, which states that both oral and rectal administration have a bioavailability of 32%.

My life has sucked. My mom died when I was 12 and I watched. My dad died when I was 20 and I watched. I gained weight until I was 300 pounds. Dropped out of school and can't keep a job. My remaining family hates me and tells me I'm a burden and will get thrown out on my ass any day now. I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis that affects my mobility. They refuse to believe the diagnosis and tell me I just need to work through it and ask jesus for help.

I've had good times in my life but nothing has ever made me as happy  as opiates did. 

I was only on them for about 4 months. The sky parted and I ended up with about 4 bottles of oxycodone. I only took about 6 to 8 a day. God damn though. I felt a peace and happiness that I thought went away forever when my mom died. I cry remembering it.

I'm 26 now and would rather only live another few years feeling the way I did then than 50 feeling the way I do now. 

But my supply dried up. I went back to hell. Terrible diarrhea for a week and the onset of my RLS. Drug related or MS related? Who knows. 

I can't get any connections. Because I don't hang around anyone. I have no friends basically because of the depression and isolation I put myself through. The friends I do have are straight laced. 

Worst of all I live in a fucking utopia for pills. I'm pretty sure my state was where the phrase hillbilly heroin came from. Every redneck I see is nodding on something. But I'm not a good old boy. I'm a single unattractive female. 

I'm not asking for anything I read the rules. I assume you are all cops anyway. 

I just wish I could feel happy again. 

It's been a year and I still have dreams of pills and wake up craving them so bad I wanna cry.

I started taking norco and percocet (don't we all) back in high school, met somebody with 80's, met somebody w/Opanas, went on subs for a couple years, met somebody else w/Opanas, and most recently met dope. 
The first few time I did dope (strictly intranasal) it was ALMOST like those first few times I took norco. Lately though, dope is just...dope.
It really hit me where I was when the other night I randomly copped 4 Roxi's. Now, I didn't expect to feel much but I didn't feel literally ANYTHING. I was even researching fake roxis online but these were not-they were about as well pressed and uniform as could be. 

So I'm at a crossroads. Of course I still want to get high. I will literally always want to get high. But its apparent the next step from here is the needle (how I avoided it for 8 years already, I don't know). Do I say fuck it and go for it...or do I take this as a [final] realization that the ride is over?

Obviously the decision is up to me, but I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say.

But just in case, here's the story of my brother Jesse. He was 28, charming, good-looking, and everyone freaking loved him.

He started with pills, for legit pain in his back. That was in 2012. I'm not sure when exactly but at some point in the last two years he started shooting up heroin. New year's eve 2013/2014 he tells us what he's been doing. He wants to get clean. My parents both take two weeks off work, he's not allowed to wipe his ass without one of them in the room. They monitor him like crazy, and try to get him through the withdrawals on their own. He's good for a while. Then messes up. At this point my dad wants to kick him out, my mom wants to put him on suboxon. Mom wins. He starts the subs. He starts doing really good. Gets a job. Plays disc golf. Loves my kids.... Then he says he's done. Life is good, he doesn't need the subs. He stops them...still seems to be doing okay, but my mom has her suspicions. 

He said he was smart. He was on this site almost every single day. He said he knew what he was doing. He would always start out slow,so he knew what he was doing.

But then one day when I'm there visiting, and at this point he had been ""good"" for like 4 months...He goes to Newark, shoots up and dies, alone in his car.
 
He told my 84 year old grandmother, whom he loved dearly, that he was going to get her milk. I only see him a few times a year, and I was visiting with my kids. My mom has devoted her entire freaking life to him for the past year trying to help him. I texted him every week to let him know I was thinking about him. 

What was going through his mind? And do any of you believe that every time you shoot up, you risk death? Don't you have anyone who loves you? How can a substance be stronger than that? This all happened two weeks ago and I'm just trying to wrap my mind around it.

I jumped off the 3mg just over 10 days ago.  I used kratom for days 2-6 (which cured the WDs), but today is absolutely horrible.  Has the Kratom simply put the WDs off, and that is why this is so bad at day 10?

I was all but forced onto subs at the detox facility I went to following 7 months of snorting dope –  which ended up at about 10-13 bags a day.  My life and profession do not permit WDs, and that was the biggest contributor to my daily use.  Suboxone is a FANTASTIC option for many -- maintenance definitely has advantages for an addict -- but I absolutely HATE being depended on anything, and I utterly despised every line I snorted, and every strip I put under my tongue for the past several months.

I was only on suboxone this long because of the people running my outpatient program.  They continued to manipulate me to stay on it, and even threatened to withhold comfort meds if I stopped.  Although I am mentally done with all this, I fear I am at a breaking point with these WDs, and I would like to know what I am realistically in for.

I was curious if anyone has any experiences with it? It'll clearly be like the high from hydro, but what kinda dosages are we looking at? Says on the bottle that you're supposed to take 5 mL every 6 hours, so would 15 mL do it?

EDIT: Just took 15 mL. I guess I'll post about my experience here since I can't find much on this stuff. Little bit about with my previous use. I've done Hydro like 3 times before, Oxy once, Tramadol once, and Lean once. So opioids aren't completely foreign to me, but in no way am I experienced. I'll report back in an hour or so when the effects will probably start kicking in. 

3:45 - Took the 15 mL dose, tasted pretty good tbh 

4:00 - I'm starting to feel a little something. A slight euphoria can be felt, and I have that warm feeling in my stomach. This is really nice. Currently just chilling and listening to some tunes. 

4:15 - Ho-ho-ho-holy shit- this high is better than any other opioids I've had before. It's more intense and I can feel it through my body. I love this. 

5:15 - High has worn down a bit, so I'll give a full report. 

This syrup is really interesting. It's like the high you get from hydro (clearly, hydro is the active pain killer) but less intense which I think can be credited to the homatropine. I really enjoyed this high honestly- much more than I do actualy hydro and oxy honestly. It was a lot less intense, yet it still filled you with the feelings of not caring and you just felt a lot more clear in the head. Music still sounded awesome like it does on other stuff, but it was just kinda different. Once I get home tonight at around 10, I think I'll take 40 or 50 mL and see what it's like.

Basically, I went to a therapist and after about 8 meetings he and I  decided a xanax perscription would be appropriate. Probably after my first refill the drug problem I already had came out to my parents/drs etc. Talked it over and everything, did a quick sub taper and then pissed clean for my parents every day for the last 2 months. Talked to my therapist about it and he agrees that I should continue my perscrion he sent me to his dr friend which I see every once in a blue moon, usually he just perscribes it to me over the phone because my other dr asked him to.

Now to the question.  I had a meeting with the perscribing dr and left with a handwritten script for xanax .5mg 30 pills no refill. So last night I decided I really fucking needed my perscription, it had run out (which is why I had that appointment) and I went to a 24 hour cvs. 

They looked at my script for 10 minutes then ""oh sorry we only do this for people in our area sorry can;t fill it"" Argued for a while gave up, went to another walgreens. WOULDN'T FILL IT THERE EITHER. gave me some bullshit excuse I couldnt even understand and I left. Went to a third pharmacy, FILLED THE SCRIPT NO FUCKING PROBLEM. NOT A PROBLEM. So the issues were totally false, made up because they just didnt want to fill my script.

Seriously isn't it a pharmacists fucking job to PERSCRIBE THE MEDS GIVEN BY A DOCTOR? tHEY DONT GET TO CHOOSE? Why would both cvs deny me, one walgreens deny me, and the fourth I walked in and out with it in 10 minutes super fucking easily. I just want to understand how could I posibly have so much trouble with this. I had a legit script I wanted filled, don;'t they do that everyday? wtf was up with all this bs?Oviously there are no laws against it because I got it filled so clearly the other pharmarcies were blowing me off. Just trying to understand why the fuck it was so difficult to get a legitimate script of xanax from a pharmacy? Isn't that their job? Give medicine to doctors patients? Not fuck around with bullshit excuses while im tryng to get my anxiety meds??

Clearly if one pharmacy filled it, there are no fucking issues with anything so why the hell did it take 4 pharmacies to find one who actually wants to sell medicine to patients?",1421598935.0

Or do I just have a high tolerance to pharmaceutical opiates (blues, opana, D's)?","I have been doing all sorts of opiates in pill form (primarily blues) for the past 2-3 years now.  On a normal day, I'll snort 3 - 5 blues (roxy 30mg) and sometimes I smoke them too.

I always get high and my pupils always get pinned.  Smaller doses (like 1 blue or a few hydrocodone) will get me high or at least feelin' good.  Every other pharmaceutical opiate I've tried (hydrocodone, oxycodone, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, fentanyl) has gotten me plenty high with no doubts of their authenticity or efficacy.

Recently, I've tried and succeeded in finding a connection for heroin.  I've been interested in H for the same reason most people are: it's cheaper and more potent than my expensive as fuck roxy habit.  BTH is the only kind available in my area so smoking is my preferred ROA because I don't shoot and I hear monkey water isn't the best way to do it.  I've bought BTH from the same person twice now and I have yet to get truly high.  The first time I only bought .2 to just try it out and I ended up smoking all of it over the course of about an hour because I never felt high.  I thought I may have been getting some slight effects, but I'm not sure whether or not it was just placebo mind high sorta shit.  The 2nd time I bought from this person I bought .5 and basically did the same thing.  I just smoked it non-stop until it was all gone about 2 hours later... I felt the same sort of, ""maybe I'm high, but maybe this is just a placebo effect"" feeling.  Despite my pretty good tolerance for opiates in pill form, I still thought I would get *fucked up* off of this amount being that heroin is supposed to be the best fucking opiate in existence.  At the very least I feel like I should have been confidently feeling good.

The 1st bag I bought (.2) was a very dark brown (almost black) color, smelled fairly strongly of vinegar/barbecue sauce, had the consistency of a sturdier, but chewy caramel candy (maybe even a gummy bear), and dripped/rolled/spilled nicely down the foil as I smoked it.  The 2nd bag (.5) was pure black (but when pressed thinly it was a deep red/maroon: like strawberry jelly), smelled VERY faintly of vinegar, was quite soft (it could be easily smooshed and molded in my fingers), and did not drip or move at all along the foil when smoked.

So does it sound like I'm getting ripped off?  Or am I just being too cautious and I need to smoke more to get high due to my tolerance?",1421742874.0

I am going to an impatient detox center tomorrow for opiate and benzo withdrawal. My habit consists of 3 dillaudid(hydromorphone 8mg) IVed a day. Along with 3 mg of xanax. I also take suboxone too. Very small quantities usually 1.5 mg a day every few days when not using opiates. This has been going on for 3 weeks. I got clean for a week from opiates right after christmas. However before that I was on suboxone and dillaudids for like 10 months either 2 Dillys a day or (low dose sub like 2mg a day).

I am not going to rehab because my insurance wont cover it.
Anyways here are my questions.
What drugs do they give you to help detox from opiates? from benzos? Am I going to be hooked up to an IV? How long do you guys think I will be in there for?
Also what is it like? What will the doctors be doing? Will I be able to bring in my laptop or any books to read? Will they give me something to help me sleep? Its gonna cost me 500$ with insurance for the detox...
Anyways thanks guys! I hope I will stay clean for good!

I haven't even been using long. Why do I do this to myself?,"I keep doing this to myself. I don't feel any actual craving for heroin or opiates, I've generally been feeling great mentally, but someone wanted to go halves on a bun and i said yes like I always do.  

Long story short: I used for the first time about a year and half ago. A close friend has been selling to me and started me on the junk and I had a lot of mental issues and the numbness was too perfect. Then I didn't see that friend for nearly a year and as soon as I did we fell right back into that cycle.  

I could literally ask my friend to just not let me have any more but I can't. I just want it and it's no good. I hide it from my husband and every other person I know. People don't like to hear you've been doing heroin, and especially when it comes to me, someone you would never guess is a daily stoner let alone a few-times a year heroin junkie.  

This is one of those binges...I've been doing heroin for about 2 weeks straight - snorting about 1-2 bags a day while at and after work and then doing more on the weekend - up to 6 bags last Saturday (over about 12 hours). Tame shit compared to what others have gone through, but since this is a throwaway, I'll admit I've thought about IV'ing to the point of actually finding out if you can buy needles OTC where i live. It would save a shit ton of money. (I've spent about $300 on heroin in the past 2 weeks and I owe $50 next friday when I get paid) See? my enabler friend even gives me on credit! wtf...she seems like she's not struggling at all and she always snorts too, but we just don't talk about it. I've gone on drug deals with her which is scary cuz we're middle class white girls that has no business being in the areas we go to to purchase heroin from minors on bicycles.  

So right now...haven't used in probably 28? hours. I can't remember when I snorted my last bag yesterday. Hey, here's a question, if I had saved my last bag and gradually snorted throughout the day, would that have just prolonged the withdrawal or eased the withdrawal?? I was going to save that bag but i thought i had 2 bags left and when I saw it was only 1 i decided fuck it, I'm snorting the whole thing. Go out with a bang lol.  

Oh and yes, I've also smoked it before but i still prefer snorting and would rather not work my way up to IV'ing. In my mind IV'ing is that step between becoming an addict and being an addict. maybe it's not true, but I don't think I can bring myself to IV, which means I'll keep on snorting and complaining to my husband how we're broke when he doesn't even know I'm spending ridiculous amounts of money on heroin...he thinks i've been buying weed but I just haven't been smoking as much since i started snorting.  

anyway, this got long, sorry. My body aches, i've got diarrhea and I'm hungry but i puked earlier and am scared to eat. I wish I was sleepy. Even took tylenol pm to try to force myself to sleep and it's only made me a little sleepy, not knock-me-out-tired like my beloved china white or afghan brown (I'm not picky lol). ",1421725560.0

So I went back in with a couple hard-to-disprove complaints. Eventually a doc took a thorough look at my chart and called me out. I told her I really did have back pain and my doc had cut me off. She sent me home with clonidine and stuff, which was better than nothing. Except that I waited awhile and went back in for something else, and that doc said he wouldn't write for anything but ibuprofen due to my history.

So my question: Do ERs put an obvious note on your account (like in your profile, not under previous visits) flagging you as a junkie, or would new docs have to actually go through your old records to put it together? ",1421722251.0

So long story short with that is I have legit scripts and a pain clinic.

So my scripts never last the two weeks they are written for. I mean they u saw ed to but we all know how that goes. I have had my 50 x 4mg dilaudid l as t as short as 4 days at one point. I then have to suck it up and feel like shit for 5 to 10 days. This is not very smart when you have chronic pain issues. My parents pretty much forced me to mover in with them 14 montha ago so I could finally apply for disability. It will the one year max they said. I'm now going on my 15th m9nth, denied twice, and now waiting for a court date. I can't work and everyday feels the same so the opiates not only help with the pain but also help give me motivation to get some things done, soul searching, painting, riding my mountain bike when possible. However recently they found a used needle, on top of my mom filming me walking around the house asleep, due to too big of a shot with benedryl mixed in. So they said they would tell my pain doc or I have to let them hold my meds. So of course i chose hold onto my meds. So this is the first two weeks of that and I found her stash hole and replaced all 50 pills with generic aspirin with no identifying marks. So not only am I a schemey  bastion I'm also taking advantage of their nievity. I feel awful but waiting 6 hours for each pill would be torture. I need more self control, or at least a friend to confide 8n, as literally NO ONE knows what I do. 

I don't know the point of this post. Maybe just a confession because of the not having someone to talk to.

Apparently this person used IV bupe on a patient currently on vivitrol and it did indeed work. Another doctor comes in later to confirm the same prescription on a similar individual.

 So what I'm curious about is this: is it possible to use bupe to bump the vivitrol (naltrexone) blockers off your receptors, and then from there break through the bupe as one would normally, or even just wait a day for the bupe to wear off. I guess it would depend on whether the naltrexone was kicked off the receptors permanently, or if once the bupe wore off the naltrexone just latched right back on because it stuck around.

Here's the forum I was reading: http://forums.studentdoctor.net/threads/vivitrol-and-legit-acute-pain.668545/

I want to ""stealth"" it by making a suspension by grinding the pills and adding it to something like children's tylenol or advil, at a concentration where 5-10 ml will be enough oxy but not much of the other med. Child tylenol is 160mg/5ml and advil is 100/5ml. I prefer advil, and the maximum threshold for it is even higher than tylenol. You could take 30 doses of it in 24 hours and still be below the daily limit. 

I don't shoot or insufflate; I just swallow my pills. So I don't know anything about grinding (but I have a mortar and pistil and could do it with no problem.)


I can't imagine that grinding them up and adding them to something they already add to - percocet is oxy IR in apap, and they make vicoprofen and combunox, which are hydrocodone or oxycodone in ibuprofen.

So my question is  - is it that simple? I am just a casual user. 

Sorry for the noob question. I know enough about opiates, but I just take them as pills, since I am casual user, 30 makes me good and high.

I have really bad anxiety which for some reason this week which has decided to be extra bad. I was diagnosed with cancer in November and this week I have  been feeling really awful. I have been having some issues with my family (my grandma who I live with is on some type of medication for pretty much every single thing you could possibly think of and some of the combinations make her a raging bitch, some make her so out of it its funny but annoying to deal with and some make her seem like she is absolutely retarded - shes been in raging bitch mode for the past couple of days and making every thing into a problem or argument and just being a miserable cunt all around which in turn makes my grandpa really cranky and he then takes it out on me and my husband). On top of all that my husband lost his job which was pretty much our only source of income due to me having cancer and not being able to work (I do get disability but its almost comical how little they give me). Plus I have a lot of issues from things from my past (bad childhood, abusive relationships, PTSD from my military service, and I lost my twin brother to an OD when we were 19) which all has been haunting me extra hard the last couple of days. Basically I have been having a prolonged mental breakdown/deep depression not wanting to get out of bed style week. 

Anyway I am on suboxone. I get a full months worth at a time because I am smart about my use with it and my doc doesn't realize I don't take it as prescribed and when I went to fill my prescription the other day at the pharmacy they gave me an entire extra box of 8 mg strips! Which was awesome. I was like sweet I can make some money off this and maybe buy a little dope. But of course like everything always goes, when I have no extra subs everyone wants them but then once I have them no one wants them at all. Well that changed last night. The dude that I have selling them for me hits me up and says ""I got $100 for selling some of those subs"". YAY! So I tell him turn that into dope call me when I can come get it. He starts making all these excuses, being confusing and mad sketchy (like telling me he needed gas money to go get the dope when the price that I told him to give me for each sub strip was so little that he had plently of room to make something for himself plus he makes something off each bun he gets me playing middle man) and is like I gotta go argue with my gf Ill talk to you tomorrow. And Im like damn what I just thought was going to be something good for a change went down the shitter again and I'm all worried that this dude who has been a good friend but can sometimes be a little sketch just pulled some bullshit and fucked me over. 

Fast forward to this morning. I wake up in a good mood (weird but hey that's not a bad thing right?) I find 180 generic 80mg Oxycontin. I have a stupid high tolerance 8 blues in a 15 min time period had me a little high but not even close to nodding so I figure I'll try one of these see what it does but they probably aren't going to do much but HOT DAMN these things are awesome! 2.5 of them had me to the moon nodded the fuck outttttt they are AWESOME!

Finally dboy calls and says he will be ready to meet me in like 30 mins. I go to the spot he says to meet, hes actually there -- shocker, this dude is always late. He gives me my shit super stealth, again I was shocked because I really have no idea how he isn't in jail yet with the way he talks on the phone and texts straight reckless. So i get in my car and count out make sure every thing is there and not only are the bags the size they usually are if i go with him (if i don't he always pinches them) but there was extra!

""When you do something pleasurable, anything at all, your brain releases endorphin (endomorphine) which binds to the opiate receptors in your brain so basically the opiate receptors are the 'ultimate' pleasure receptors in your brain which means they are extremely powerful (and important!).

 You use them every day when you feel happy or enjoy doing something. Heroin is a prodrug, which means it gets metabolized (processed) to morphine which binds to said opiate receptors. So basically, what heroin does is make you feel ultimate, supreme happiness like no other drug would ever be capabale of.

yeah so tldr; subs or methadone plz uk opies? im cryin just thinking about it.. wanna fuckin die, just dont have the strength of will do actually go through with killing myself.",1421779525.0

One of the conditions of my pain management contract is that I was to stop taking xanax for my anxiety, as they are a dangerous combination. This entire 2 year period of being this doctor's patient, I've been completely compliant to her wishes.

However, do to a severe anxiety/panic attack from a traumatic experience, I took a total of 6 miligrams of xanax yesterday.

Here's the thing though, my husband is willing to come with me and provide a urine sample for me. Just this one time, he says, as he understands what I have been going through. This will be easy to do due to the lay out of the very large office building and its schematics, etc.

I've read from many sources that it's vey hard to differentiate male and female urine, unless say the female is pregnant. A special, prohibitively expensive test would have to be done... radioimmunoassay I believe its called. Is it really possible for him to provide for me a sample this one time?

Also, he takes tramadol for pain, does that show up in a 5 or 10 panel? It wouldn't be as big a deal if it showed up, she (the doctor) knows I've taken it via prescription before and is much more lenient about that medication.

I can't just explain to her about why I needed to take the xanax, she's very strict with her contracts.

Any advice? I'm really nervous, and any advice you could give me would be invaluable.

Edit: holy shit I meant to say 3 mg xanax haha! I had meant to say 6 0.5 mg pills!",1421779410.0

When I handed the sample off, they called my name again and had a mouth swab waiting for me. She said ""To see how you metabolize your medications."" And I assumed that just meant another drug test. 

Didn't hear anything about it the next month, just a urine test that visit, then on my visit last month they did the swab again. I have been concerned for a little bit now about if they are measuring the amount of oxycodone in my tests- as I take more than prescribed especially that week prior to my appointment after stopping all other use, but after going there for 8 months no one has pointed out level differences.. So I thought maybe this mouth swab thing was doing that. 

I forgot about it for a bit, and it just crossed my mind again so I did another google search (First time did a search too, but didn't find anything on topic.) and finally found some info- but not a ton.

Apparently the test does literally as she said.. It shows IF and HOW my body metabolizes the drugs. For example, some people are extremely resistant to Codeine, like their particular make up cannot process it. And this test supposedly can show a doctor that. I'm wondering if it would help them determine tolerance, or if anyone has more information on this.. or if any of my fellow pain patients on here have had this test before and have heard/seen the results.

So guys, what do you know about this mouth swab that shows how our bodies metabolize our medications?",1421778374.0

Would the withdrawal still be just as painful or would the heroin ease it really well? Keeping in mind I've kicked heroin cold turkey and it was awful, but I did it. So I know what it's like. I also never romanticized it, or covered my problems with it, I just wanted to get high lmfao.

What I'm thinking is, if I accidentally get hooked on xanax, I go get heroin to calm down the withdrawal symptoms to a minimum, and then use loperamide to get off the heroin. (Got through a 5 month binge scott free thanks to loperamide). No cravings either.

TL;DR Heroin for xanax withdrawals. Then kick heroin. Then stay clean. Keeping in mind I'm using the heroin medicinally, not to get high. I won't take any more than what is necessary to keep the hallucinations and skin crawling to a bare minimum.",1421927443.0

I've never ventured too far away from it either or drastically increased my usage until a few months ago where it totally spiked. I really thought this is exactly what people warn you about it finally took control of my life. 

But something with the article clicked. My environment changed, I now saw my world as a cage (work drama, friend drama, life drama) things weren't fun anymore and it wasn't the playground I always lived in. So I started fixing the things I could control and removed the negative energy and my using went right back to where they have been for years. Its a scary awakening and I can see how quickly I was able to slip and I am so glad I read it.

Well my phone had died so I went and plugged it in and started to cook dinner. I go check my phone and I have 20+ texts messages and 10 calls from him. He told me I stole his shit and I'm going to get mine and I'm a piece of shit and he wants it back and all this crazy shit! I tried to tell him that I didn't have it and that I didn't go in his house with him (which is where I apparently stole it from) this fucker has me in tears screaming at me and threatening me. He won't even listen to my side of the story and is so fucked up on his Xanax that he doesn't realize that his story doesn't even make sense!! Has anyone else ever had this happen to them?

Edit 1: okay so he's called me twice already this morning. He finally believes I never went in the house with him but he still can't find his shit... He seems to be putting his memory (slightly) back together and he remembers he put it in a bill to crush it into powder.. I told him if he wants another pair of eyes to help him look for it I'd help him (probably stupid but I feel bad for him, even though he was a dick to me) so as it stands now I believe he knows I didn't take it but it's still missing in his house.

I'm now 22, but used opiates (and any other drug) recreationally since I was 15. At first, it was purely experimental - reading hours of Erowid about certain substances before trying them, etc. Of course it gradually grew to self-medication. Before becoming addicted to opiates at 19 I had a steady bout of benzo addiction from 16/17-18. I was clean from pills for about a year before I got addicted to the opiates. My true love.

Looking back on my childhood and teenage years, I have come to the realization that I was never exactly the ""happiest"" of kids. I wasn't exactly a bad kid (although in my teen years that could be debated) and I didn't do anything specific to lash out. The drug use in my teen years was my only real form of public lashing out.

Anyways, I've come to develop (or it's just gotten worse and I've come to the realization) a pretty bad problem with depression. I'm not sure if the addiction came first, and caused the depression - or if it was the other way around, with the depression leading into the addiction.

As most of you probably know, this addiction can (and will) end up taking everything from you. So far it's really only taken my friends (save for an except few), thousands and thousands of dollars, and my mental health. Some days I wake up fine, and other I wake up with this idea of ""why do I even bother waking up today?""

I guess what I'm really posting this for is to inquire about other's problems with depression. How is it affecting you? Other than more drugs, what are the best ways to combat it? Do you feel like your addiction has made it worse?

Hold your head up high people. Be thankful for what you have. I'm starting to realize that my family (and specifically my 10 year old little brother) is the one true thing worth living for. I really need to see a therapist/shrink. I'm going to get on that..",1421886670.0

I am currently 32 years old. This is a throwaway account.

My first experience with suboxone came after my then new wife caught me sniffing bags in the bathroom while away at the beach for a weekend (September 2008).  That monday I had my first appointment with the sub doctor and from that moment until December of this year I had been biologically dependent on either an opiate or the subs (i think i will always be psychologically addicted).  My typical pattern went like this:

I would use the subs for a few days or until payday when I would then have some extra money to get high.  When I was either unable to cop or too broke to do so, Id simply use the subs to get me through.  I cant begin to estimate how many times I had tried to come off subs and opiates all together and the rude awakening I experienced when I found out about the withdrawal from subs.  My only success came during a three week trip out of the country with my brothers where I had managed to get my sub dose down to under 1mg per day and by the end of the trip had three days completely sober.  Guess what happened the day I got back?  That was three years ago and I was stuck back in the cycle until this past December.

Around September I recommitted to myself to get off opiates/subs and scored a good amount subs from a friend and decided I was going to use them to come off.  Mind you, my wife had no idea I was still using or that I was biologically addicted. Aside from every few months where I would get a little too high around her and she'd see that look in my eyes,  I assume she thought I was staying clean for the most part (is someone clean if they are taking subs???).

I read a good blog article where a guy detailed his own detox program beginning at 2mg.  The process looked something like this: 2mg/day, 2mg, 2mg, 2mg, 1.5mg, 2mg, 2mg, 2mg, 1.5, 2mg, 2mg, 1.5, 2mg, 1.5, 2mg, 1.5, 1.5, 2mg, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1mg, 1.5, 1.5, 1.5, 1mg.....and so forth.  This worked for the most part except the .5mg jumps were a little much for me.  So I did the same thing except having the film strips I began cutting them down to reduce by .25mg.  I used my swiss army knife scissors to cut a strip in half, then in half again, and again, and again until I had .25mg tiny squares.  once I got down to taking 1mg/day, I cut the .25mg squares down even further to the point what I was taking was the size of a period on your computer screen.  Id take 4 of those across the day then try to take three a day for a week, then once in the morning and once at night.  If I felt I needed more Id take it, but Id also be very mindful that taking too much was going the wrong direction.

Now, this was not an entirely smooth process from Sept-Dec, three times I lapsed and Id go from taking line .5mg per day all the way back to 2mg for a day or so then Id have to work my way back down. Im weak, what can I say?  Nothing was sweeter than the first day I didnt take any.  I felt that I had accomplished a huge feat, one I had been struggling with for years.  Now after two days of nothing I was feeling poorly and had to take another period sized dot, then again two days later, then that was it. it was over.

That morning I woke up feeling great, I slept through the night and felt no further withdrawal or post-accute anything.  Two guesses what the first thing I thought about then was.....but ive been sober for a little over a month, the longest period of complete abstinence since I was 13 or 14 years old.

Researchers for the article were surprised that this is a common story, but I sadly was not surprised. 

I use opiates for a multitude of reasons but to feel better physically is definitely number one. My doctor would prescribe basically anything else other than opiates to treat my chronic pain - She even suggested a pain contract but then changed her mind. (I'm looking for a new doc, but we all know that it's hard to just walk into a new doc office with no relationship and walk out with good meds.) I tried to keep it legit, even when that meant spending hours out of each month waiting to be seen in the ER/urgent care.

But I ended up deciding on here because a) the drug that is getting in my way is my subutex, which I take for my past heroin addiction. And I'm sure many of you are familiar with that or suboxone. B) since many of you on here are pill addicts I'm sure y'all know the ins and outs of the rx monitoring report. C) this sub is more active than the benzo one, so I figured I figured I'd get more advice. 

So anyways, I've been on psychiatric meds for almost 15 years. I have a history of drug addiction, but that history is not as long as my history of being on psychiatric medication. When In fact I probably got on drugs in the first place due to my bad anxiety and not handling it properly. 

I have been off psychiatric medication for a year now, but decided to go back to a new psychiatrist today because my anxiety was getting worse. However, although it is mainly my anxiety getting worse,  I didn't want to go in and just ask for straight benzos, so I also tried to get rxs for my other psych drugs I normally take - Lithium, etc. 

Now I have been on subutex for a year and a half now. I am a (recovering) heroin addict, and like I said I have had anxiety issues longer than I've had issues with heroin. 

As an addict, I know we are constantly stigmatized by our past or present, so I decided not to tell this psychiatrist that I am currently a subutex patient. I've gotten benzos before on subutex and on methadone, but because of my old doctor retiring and me taking a break from psych meds I had to find a new one. 

So the psychiatrist was asking me the normal questions : mental health history, family life, etc. And of course she asked the drugs questions : in terms of family history I said that I think my dad was an alcoholic in the 70s (I didn't mention his morphine /doctor shopping habit before he died). But I wanted to sound realistic so I mentioned that. And in terms of my drug use I just told her my (current and true)  situation : that I don't use any drugs and have maybe one to two beers a week. 

Then she started asking me more of the normal questions, and I noticed she started to go back to the drug questions, re asking me questions that I had already answered. She was doing this while looking something up at the computer on her desk. 

So after she finishes asking me questions I hear my verdict: ok, so I'll give you so and so drugs because they've worked for you in the past, but I will not give you clonopin or ativan because you totally just lied about being on buprenorphine. After she said that I came clean on the truth: ""well ma'am I had a good reason to do that - I'm sick of paying co-pays at new doctors only to have them stigmatize me and change my rx the second they find out I'm on an opioid replacement. I'm not trying to get this medication for inappropriate reasons: I'm trying to get it because I genuinely need it. "" but of course she didn't care. 

When she was asking questions she obviously was pulling up my rx monitoring report. Now one thing that is my fault is that when I filled out the original paperwork I clicked ""yes"" to the rx monitoring report thing, but I only did that because virtually none of my psychiatrists have used that on me in the past. I've gotten away with getting benzos several times while on some sort of opioid replacement therapy without the doctors ever knowing. 

So here are my questions : how much can be seen on the rx monitoring report? Is it just what rxs you've had in the past and when and /or where you got them?  And does it say why you're on those meds? Because if it doesn't say why you're on those meds, for future times at different psychiatrists could I just say ""yes, I'm subutex,  but I take it for pain management because I don't like opiates?"" (obviously me not liking opiates is a total lie but they won't know that). And does anyone actually take subutex for pain? I know there are a lot of people that take methadone for pain and I've read online that subutex can be prescribed for pain... But I don't think I've ever seen any doctor rx it for that purpose alone. So if I did say that I take it for pain would it be believable? And are a lot of psychiatrists getting instant access to this rx monitoring report nowadays? Or only just some or a few? And does the rx monitoring report costs the doctors $ to use? 

Lastly, I really do have anxiety and I really do need these pills. I don't like taking benzos to get messed up.. I want these because I really need them. So do any of y'all have tips for me on how to not have an incident like this happen again? 

The doctor never even asked why I was on subutex... She was too busy being overjoyed for herself catching me in a lie.

And I figured I'd add this : my sub doctor DOES allow his patients to take benzos (I know that some don't). So he wouldn't have a problem with it, and I know this for a fact because I've been on them in the past while being a patient in his office. So it's not the sub doctor I have to convince or hide anything from- it would be whatever psychiatrist I choose to go to next. I just wanna be able to live a normal life without being anxious anymore. ",1422086492.0

Apparently the brick cost $300 if I were to buy it (the person paid $250 because the person they got it from is their boy). How many of those would be a fair trade? 


The reason I need to ask is I got the pills for free and haven't fucked with pills other than blues (which around here are pretty much $30 all day unless you're getting quantity then you can get them down to $20 at the lowest pretty much; unless you have something worked out with someone where you by their whole script) and greens (which are $15 all day unless you're getting quantity and then you can get them down to $10 at the lowest; again unless you have something worked out with someone where you straight up buy their whole script from them). So basically oxy is $1/mg in my world, so I have no concept of how much those are worth or how much I should charge for them.

I told him I've done crazy shit when sick so I understand but I'm still keep his shit. I gave him half of what he took and walked off. in the bag was weed, and other shit. l kept the weed, and a knife  and a pipe. I saw him today and sold him the rest of his stuff.

were broken, ugly weak.


While waiting there for hours
They dance from lack of sleep

The stench had hit me hard
It singed my nostril hairs


I wait while weak and weary
Too tired for the stairs 

Hours turned to days
I wait there in the corner


Tries to think of ways
But fog consumes me further

I'm fevered, sweaty, weak
The box just will not come
 

I'm on a losing streak
Just short of getting some

Finally after months
The box has come for me


To relieve me from my slump
Content is soon to be

The corner in the box
Is worse than than that upstairs


Metal dirty gross 
Still I lean, too weak for fear

After about a day
The box halts and opens up


Violent sun shines my way
First time in months

THEN finally THERE HE IS!
With heaven in his hand


THE beacon OF RELEIF!
I've been waiting for my man

The exchange was brief and simple 
I barely remember it


I turn to that vile box
And happily I sit

Takes a couple minutes
For me to reach my floor


Then a couple seconds 
To finally reach  my door

Sweaty weak and weary
With heaven in my hand


I push it in my body
Gracefully leave this land

Goodnight , goodbye , farewell.
Good luck with all of it


I'm finished, it's over, I'm done.
(Till I need another hit)

I dabbled a bit in hydrocodone, taking up to 30mg, but only kept it to once a week at least. I found a consistent oxycodone hookup just recently, and tried 20mg for my first time. I was in absolute heaven. I never get any unpleasant effects from opiates unlike most people. I never get the opiate itch or nausea and I never have any unpleasant feelings the next day..


I wouldn't mind taking oxycodone once every two weeks or so, but I want to keep it at that. I feel that I have very strong willpower and have never been addicted to anything besides nicotine. I have a good home life and an amazing girlfriend whom I love. She's not really cool with drug use, but I never use drugs anymore besides the occasional opiate. I used to use psychedelics, dissociatives, amphetamines, cocaine, and smoke a lot of pot. I've cut all of that shit out of my life, and instead reward myself with the euphoria of opiates like 1-2 times every month. 


My question is, should I stop now or could I continue to use Percocet 1-2 times a month without it becoming a habit/addiction? I'll admit that I had cravings for it the next day after I used it, but that went away the next day. I just feel like instead of using drugs as constantly as I used to, I can use opiates very rarely as a little reward. ",1422030883.0

I only worked at the small independent one for a month.  This was kind of an introductory job for me as I had just passed the national exam to get my license and didn't have any current experience.  I had to stop smoking weed for a few months to get this job in case they drug tested me, which they didn't because it was small and independently owned.  I ended up using this job as experience for my next one so during this time I didn't steal any drugs or smoke pot.  Even though this pharmacy kept all of it's drugs out on the shelf.  A number of pharmacies will keep all of their c2's, oxy, morphine, ect.. in a locked safe and many of these pharmacies only have the pharmacist handle them.  

This was the case and the next pharmacy I worked at.  All c2 drugs were in a locked cabinet in the back of the pharmacy.  Lucky for me I had a nonexistent tolerance and one of my favorite drugs had yet to be rescheduled as a c2 so it was still on the regular shelves.  That drug was hydrocodone.  We had bottles and bottles of this shit.  At any one time we tried to keep 3 500 count bottles of each strength hydrocodone on hand.  That meant 1500 tabs of 5/325, 1500 7.5/325, and 1500 10/325.  Needless to say, I was in heaven.  I kept my use very low for about 4 months, using about once over 1 or 2 weeks.  I had a virtually unlimited supply so I shared with my friends.  Every time I stole it was incredibly nerve racking but at the same time incredibly easy.  While the pharmacy had cameras, I knew where they all were as I had seen them in the backroom.  I knew that where I counted pills there was no camera on me so when ever I counted hydrocodone I would dump out a few extra or ""spill"" them onto the counter and then slip them into my pocket.  At this time I was not taking very many at all, about 6 or so tabs when I did it and I did it about every other week.
This changed when I was asked to do the outdates for the pharmacy.  I was going through the box that another tech had put together of drugs that were going to expire when I saw a bottle that had not been logged.  A sealed bottle of 10-500 hydrocodone.  I though long and hard and did it.  I slipped it into my backpack a no one had any idea.  Things only got better, or worse from there.

I realized that c5-c3 drugs were usually only counted a few times per year.  C2's were counted every month but I didn't have any access to those so I didn't have to worry about it.  When they did the first count on the hydro, I was surprised to hear that everything was fine.  I was worried that they may have noticed the small amounts that I had been taking but the pharmacy was such a mess and had such poor management that no one had any idea.  This encouraged me to branch out and try other drugs.  I tried valium, klonopin, xanax, ativan, halcion, lyrica, tramadol, butalbital with codeine, buprenorphine, cyclopbenzaprine and soma.  All of these drugs were at the tips of my fingers on a daily basis.  I then discovered something called ""return to stocks"".  Basically if a prescription had been sitting on the shelf for more than 13 days it has to be put back or it is considered insurance fraud.  Sometimes I ended up putting them back, in my pocket...  I was able to get hydromet syrup and tussionex this way as well as larger quantities of hydro and benzo's.  There were a few times when a c2 would be returned to stock and I was very tempted to take it, but I had come to realize that c2's were the only thing that really mattered in the pharmacy and I would be completely fucked if I took any, plus it made me look good/reliable when I would bring them over to the pharmacist because I wasn't even supposed to be handling them.  That being said did acquire a few c2's while working there.  The pharmacy was getting super dirty, there was dust everywhere so I took it upon myself to do a little cleaning on one of the slower days.  I found 1 15mg morphine, 30mg ir adderall, 10mg oxy, 10mg methadone and about 40 mg of hydrocodone.  This went on for another 4 or 5 months.  I became in charge of ordering and had a very good view of what our on hand should be and what it actually is.  With this knowledge I got away with a lot.  Near the end I jacked a full 100 ct bottle of brand name norco 10/325.  Noone had any idea.  

While I was happy with the unlimited supply of drugs available to me I was beginning to hate the company that I worked for.  I had gone through 6 different pharmacy managers in a little under a year of working with the company and if that wasn't a sign I don't know what is.  I ended up quitting and getting a job at a much nicer and smaller chain pharmacy.  The best thing about this new pharmacy is that they did compounding.  That means that had pure powder of a number of different drugs.  Unfortunately they did not compound any c'2s but they had a bunch of c'3s.  The one that surprised me the most when I saw it was Ketamine.  We had this 100 gram containers of it along with pure powdered xanax, kpins, atavan and valium.  I never took any of the benzo's because dosing that would be impossible unless I did it volumetricly, but I did snag some ketamine which was pretty sweet.  I also found out that I was able to dispense c'2s at this pharmacy.  Now c'2s were still very closely regulated.  I had to double count every prescription, back count the bottle and then right the number on the bottle.  Then I had to manually log it by hand.  Taking c'2s was very risky and very nerve racking so I didn't do it very often.  Unfortunately the safest way to take a c'2 was to take it out of someones script.  I know what you are thinking, I am a fucking asshole for doing this and you know what, I agree.  I try console myself by saying that I only took unnoticeable amounts, no more than 4 tabs from a 100+ script but that doesn't negate the fact that what I did was terrible, selfish and wrong.  It's one thing to steal from a big company it's another thing to do it from someone in pain.  Luckily because I took so little noone ever noticed.  

Some of the c'2 drugs I took included 40mg oxymorphone, when I started 1/4 of these would have me lit and by the end I could do an entire tab in one go.  I also got 8mg hydroporhone along with 4 mg and 2 mg.  I was only able to get 30mg oxy's once.  This guy had a reoccurring script and was getting 220 blues a month along with 120 40mg oxymorphone and 120 8mg hydromorphone.  Seriously this guy had a script to die for and when I saw him he did not look like he needed them.  Im not saying that justifies what I did but...  I also got some 20mg ritalin tabs.  Snorting these was very close to cocaine.  Speaking of cocaine, my pharmacy had 2 types of cocaine.  We had a 5gram glass jar and then cocaine solution.  When I got a script in for it I was able to snag about .1 or so.  Let me tell you pharmaceutical cocaine is on a whole different level then street blow.  I also filled a number of scripts for opium tincture.  I couldn't exactly just poor some into a bottle as that would be too obvious.  So when I used up a whole bottle I stashed it next to the recycling instead of in it and snagged it on my way out.

Things were going good, I was again in charge of ordering and I was happy to discover that they prefered ordering the 100ct bottles of hydrocodone instead of the 500ct ones.  These small bottles could easily be slipped into my pocket and than put into my backpack and because of the computer system the pharmacy used I was able to anonymously manipulate the count so that it didn't appear that they were missing.  Also these 100 ct bottles only cost the pharmacy about $12 each so no one had any idea.  Unfortunately all good things must come to an end and in October the dea rescheduled hydrocodone as a c2.  Luckily I had far warning and was able to snag 4 100ct bottles.  2 10/325 hydrocodone, 1 5/1.5 homatropine (same thing as hydromet syrup), and a brand name Norco 10/325.  I also snagged a fair amount of each benzo, not a whole bottle but... as well as a fair amount of soma to try to stretch out the hydro that I had.

After that I decided to take it easy.  All of these stealing was giving me some major anxiety that not even the benzo's were helping.  I would promise myself that I wouldn't take anything but then a script would come along to tempt me.  Every day there was that internal battle not to succumb to the temptation.  Somedays I won somedays I lost.  I realized that this was not good for me, that if I kept doing what I was doing sooner or later I would get caught and then my life would be over.  I had already been depressed for nearly 5 years, sometimes it was really bad and sometimes it was manageable.  The hydrocodone was making it manageable but I was tearing me up inside, what I had to do to get it along with the anxiety of getting it.  

In late November my best friend died a long with a little bit of me.  I decided this was it, it was a sign that if I kept doing what I was doing than my life would be over.  So I decided to take a leave of absence from work and I haven't looked back.  I guess I should consider myself lucky, I got out while I could...  Unfortunately I took the death of my friend very hard and my use spiraled out of control until all of my drugs were gone.  And that is where I am at now, alone, sober and depressed.  I used to consider myself a good, decent person.  But now when I look back on my life all I see is a disappointment.  I have let everyone in my life down including myself even if they don't know it.  I deserved the withdrawal I had to go through while grieving for my friend although luckily it wasn't too bad and I kinda just switched to bezo's when the opiates ran out.  So now I just sit inside all day doing nothing, I don't want to go out and party or even hang out with friends.  Before when I had access to opiates I could push through my depression, I had something to look forward to at the end of the week.  Now I rarely find happiness in anything.  All the things that I used to love doing I can't do because they remind me too much of my friend.  I don't have that thing that I used to fall back on if I had a bad day.  To be honest I really just want to kill myself but I know that would just be even more selfish as it would destroy my family and the few friends I have.  So right now I am sort of in limbo, I'm here but not present just waiting until I can find the strength to carry on or the guts to not give a fuck anymore and just end it.

Anyways I just thought I would post this here with this throwaway because I thought it may interest some of you.  I am aware that I am a horrible human being and am not looking for any pity.  The depression that I have, even though I had it for many years before this all happened, is well deserved. I really enjoy spending time here as it gives me some positivity in my otherwise dreary negative life.  I am open to answering any questions you might have regarding pharmacies and filling prescriptions although I would obviously like to stay anonymous.

i tried going on suboxone. before that i had been on 110mg on methadone for a few years. in the span of 2-3 months i went down to 0 and used 3 points of H a day. went on suboxone. got to about 16-20mg. wasn't high enough for me. i woke up every single day having an anxiety attack. i didn't eat the whole time i was on it and lost a lot a lot of weight. the only time i could eat was after doing opiates and smoking a joint (i never smoke weed). after 1-2 weeks i couldn't handle the stress anymore. i couldn't even do schoolwork. i felt unwell everyday.

part of why i went on suboxone was that i was hoping that if my addiction got better then my depression would have to get better too. I've been depressed for the last year or two and i know a big reason for it is my addiction. so i thought that if i couldn't fix my depression to fix my addiction than surely i could fix my addiction and my depression would fix itself.

so now I'm stuck back on methadone, 60mg and I'm still using 2p daily. I'm trying to cut down for the billionth time but honestly I'm not as motivated as i could be because everything i try just turns to shit. they cut my weekly carries from 6 to 4 for fucking up. like if i hadn't even tried at all i would still be at 6 and i was using everyday back then too so what the fuck.

and what's fucked up is i heard from my nurse that you can't even go to detox when you're on methadone because the rate of relapse is too high. like what the actual fuck. if I'm gonna go to detox i want to get off everything. i wanted to go travel this summer so that it keeps me from using drugs. and i can't just leave for 3 months if I'm on methadone.

I was having debilitating migraines and all over body pain so I started finding myself go from taking them once or twice a week to pretty much every day. I wasn't taking a lot, but it was probably 1-4 pills a day (usually 1 or 2 but could be as high as 4 depending on the day) for about a month or two but it was pretty consistent. Sometimes I'd go a day or two without any, but that was more rare than not. 
Over the last couple weeks I've been finding myself feeling really sick every morning. I'll get chills, feel nauseous and have a really hard time eating. Sometimes I throw up, sometimes not. I ruled out pregnancy first since it was mostly in the morning, but I definitely ruled that out.
A few days ago I got a painful medical procedure done at my doctor which in the long term was suppose to help my pain issues. Because of that, I had been taking the hydrocodone pretty much around the clock for the last two days to help with the pain from the treatment. It was only one (1 and 1/2 at most) pills at a time but it was for a couple solid days every 4 to 6 hours. Last night after one dose started wearing off around 8pm, I started feeling really sick. Getting cold chills, headache coming on, nausea. I took another pill and was mostly fine for another few hours. Around midnight it started coming back so I went to bed. 4am, I was woken up violently throwing up and have been all day since then (about 14 hours as I'm writing this). I have avoided taking all medication today to be safe....does this sound like its withdrawal or just bad luck? If it is, what should I do? I realize no one here can give me real medical advice and I'm ok with that. I don't have insurance at the moment so I'm avoiding going to a doctor if at all possible so I'm just looking for the opinions of others and possible suggestions at the moment, not a real diagnoses. Any help is appreciated.",1422146760.0

Does your use complicate or jeopardize your job?","Hey everyone I've seen a couple posts recently about people having drug tests for jobs, stories about old jobs, starting out at a new job as an opiate user/addict, and others relating to jobs, basically.

Even I had posted two or three posts in November and December about drug testing for Pre employment as I had applied to several jobs that were going to drug test me. I took off using for two and a half weeks from everything including weed (which was most of the worry in terms of staying in the body) but I managed to pass both tests that were given to me, and they may even have been Lab tested. 
I myself signed a contract saying I may be randomly drug tested at any time when I started my new job in December. 

I'm derailing from my original question. What do you guys do for your jobs, considering many places drug test for employment and some industries have monthly or every two week testing, and some have random drug testing that they may do to employees every couple of months. I am thinking of industries where one works with their hands such as warehouse or construction work, my dad worked in a factory for many years and was randomly drug tested four times a year.

****THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY QUESTION Is that it applies to people that do not have a prescription for the drugs they are using...heroin included (duh)

Do you not have to worry bout drug testing at your workplace/job? Does your job make you sign contracts stating your consent to ""drug testing if deemed appropriate by management"" or have random drug testing on certain circumstances? I am not too worried about getting tested at my current job but I would like to know what other peoples experiences were and maybe I can learn what jobs and industries are somewhat user friendly, haha.

The following meds are guaranteed to alleviate your withdrawals a ton, if not get you off sick completely (especially combined):

- **Imodium**, preferably the generic Loperamide pills. NOT THE BLISTER PACKS. It's a bitch having to sit there and pop all those things out. And don't get the gel capsules either, everyone I know who has done this, me included, has gotten excruciating stomach pains and nausea/vomiting. Depending on how heavy your habit is, you might be fine taking five of the 2 mg pills, or you might have to take damn near a whole bottle of them. Taking quinine/tonic water, Prilosec, or Zantac will help, in short, potentiate the effects of the Loperamide. Personally, at my worst, I was using about $400 worth of heroin a day, IV, about a gram a shot. I was completely off sick from taking about 80 mg of lope, sometimes even less, and a lot of the time it would work better than taking Suboxone or Subutex. Also, you don't have to wait until you're disgustingly sloppy sick to take your lope like with Suboxone. 

- **Suboxone**, it's really a matter of preference if you decide to do this instead of the Lope. It's proven, it definitely works, but having to wait until you're sick enough to take it can be a pain in the ass. And god forbid if you take it too early, it's completely over. You're in precipitated withdrawals and you're just fucked. Another big thing with the Suboxone is actually taking too much when people only need a fraction of it. Personally, I have seen every single person I know using Suboxone strictly for a several-day taper as opposed to long-term maintenance only need 2 mg every, say, six hours, yet people still waste it by taking ridiculous and unnecessary amounts like 24 mg. I try to wait until I'm COMPLETELY in withdrawal and then some before I take any. As in, throwing up/shitting/kicking/sweating, then wait another 6 hours at least. I do *not* fuck around with precipitated withdrawals. If you're just taking the Suboxone for a day or two because you couldn't find anything, it is meant to block out opiates (which is also why I prefer Subutex) but I have found that it doesn't block them out completely, especially if you only take a low dose. 

- **Requip (Ropinirole)**, is an absolute lifesaver. I get restless legs/arms for up to a month when I detox, and I have found re-quip is the only thing that has worked for me. Now, it does require a prescription, but it's extremely easy to get. Personally, I have gotten it prescribed without even going to see my doctor, I just called in and told them I've been having restless legs at night and it's been keeping me up. Bam, Requip called in to my pharmacy. 

- **Benzos** you guys already know. They help with the anxiety and partially help get your mind off your withdrawals (well, as much as possible). Also can help you get an hour or two of sleep in. They're fairly easy to find on the street, but if not you might be able to get a prescription depending on your doctor. Some are very strict about what they prescribe. I was lucky enough to get prescribed Klonopin, and I would take around 15 mg but my tolerance is very high. Xanax is wonderful too, a 2 mg bar or two helps most people out a lot. Be extremely careful with benzos though, coming off of them is also very difficult not to mention dangerous so try not to use them longer than two weeks. Ativan and Valium also work too.

- **Promethazine** is anti-nausea medicine. Yeah, you know when you get to that point where you're throwing up foam after dry heaving for so long, then the bile comes? And it burns like hell? This will help you avoid that completely. It is prescription only also, but it's not hard to get a prescription for this either. I have tried many different anti-nausea meds and this has worked for me better than anything. I start off with 25 mg, and if I'm still nauseous I'll take another 25 mg. It does have some sedating properties too, so it'll help relax you to an extent too. 

- **Ambien** will at least kind of help you sleep. I know it's nearly impossible to sleep when you're going through withdrawal but Ambien does help somewhat, and it also helps you get out of your zone. Once again, a prescription is needed, but you can find it on the street or someone's mom is normally prescribed it that will give you a couple or some sort of setup like that. I would start out with 10 mg, but definitely don't go above 40 mg. Even 40 mg is pushing it for some people. Take it on an empty stomach. WARNING: I have known a couple people who Ambien has made sick to their stomach, either vomiting or diarrhea. This doesn't seem extremely common, but it has happened, and if you're dope sick that's the last thing you're gonna want. So I wouldn't really play around with this unless you've taken it before and know how you're going to react.

- **Gabapentin** helps. Crazy, right? I'm not talking 100 mg though, I'm talking high doses like around 2,000 mg. But start at about 1,200 mg and increase by 200 mg until you feel better. It's amazing how well it helps with withdrawals. This is prescription only but it's extremely, EXTREMELY easy to get a prescription for. Some people say it gives them a mild buzz too. For me, it kind of helps a little with every symptom, especially the blah mood and fatigue.

- **Clonidine** is basically for high blood pressure but helps with chills too. This is prescription only also, but once again, not hard to get prescribed. It's mostly one of those meds they give you in rehabs for medical detoxes but it definitely does help with the chills and sweats, especially night sweats (in my experience). If you're taking this on your own, make sure your blood pressure doesn't drop too low. If you start getting light headed, sit down and drink a lot of water. At most rehabs I have been to, they won't give you Clonidine/Catapress unless your blood pressure is over 110/80, so if your blood pressure normally runs low (like mine), it's probably better to just skip this since you'll most likely be weak already.

- **Weed** well, I know this is gonna be a controversial one, but I personally have had nothing but good experiences with using weed during opiate withdrawals, especially combined with benzos. It will help increase your appetite, settle your stomach, take your mind off everything, and I think it helps with chills too but I have no proof to back this up. 

- **Magnesium** helps with leg cramping and restlessness a little bit. I know someone who uses magnesium and it gets rid of their restlessness and cramping completely. In a pinch, if I have nothing else, I'll take a normal dose of it. A lot of people keep magnesium supplements around too, so it's handy.


Those are my top tried and true ways to relieve opiate withdrawal. Things that DON'T work (or only work temporarily but will make it worse after):

- Alcohol. First, it will upset your stomach. Second, it will dehydrate you. It might make you forget about your symptoms for a little bit, but trust me, it's not worth it.
- Stimulants. Some people are, for some ungodly reason, able to do stimulants while they're in withdrawals without having a fucking heart attack. They might give you some euphoria, but they'll also increase your blood pressure when it's likely already increased, not to mention the anxiety! I can't even begin to fathom how people can handle that, but to each his/her own.
- Benadryl. Actually makes restless legs worse. 
- Not eating or drinking. As hard as it is, you will feel SO much better if you force yourself to eat and drink. I would get someone to make me a lot of smoothies with fresh fruit and veggies in them. You can't taste the vegetables and it's so good for you when you're detoxing. If anyone wants any good recipes, let me know. Chicken broth, toast, etc. are all good to eat if you don't think you can hold anything down.
- Cigarettes. They tend to make you more nauseated and also tend to make you shit more which are two things you absolutely don't want when you're dope sick. If nothing else, they suppress your appetite and just make it that much harder to force yourself to eat. I smoke two packs a day but when I'm sick I have no desire to smoke, although I know it's not like that for everyone, so just try to cut back as much as you can. 

Some things you can do to get your mind off of everything:

- Netflix
- Reddit (duh), Wikipedia, 
- Kindle
- Games on your phone
- Texting or talking to people on Facebook
- Magazines
- Journal (it helps you remember the pain you're going through along with killing time)
- Hibernate as much as you can. I would always load up on benzos and Ambien and whatever else I could (not saying I condone this buttt.... it's always worked for me) and try to sleep as much as I possibly could.
- I know some people somehow, by the grace of god, can exercise. If you can do this, more power to you, I've heard it helps a lot with the blah mood and restlessness. I can't even get out of bed let alone exercise, hence everything on this list of things you can do to get your mind off shit doesn't involve leaving your bed haha. 

Alright guys, I think that's all I have. I hope this helps someone. If you're going through any of this right now, just know it gets better and keep pushing!",1422231985.0

Don't have much of a choice at the moment. On parole gave a dirty the past 4

Now I walk into wal mart and I am shook before I even walk into electronics. It's either jail an no job for a few months or no paycheck for a week and I still have a job. So I'm gonna swallow my pride and take the fucking detox tomorrow as long as I can get in.

My other almost main dude didn't answer this morning. Which pissed me off. But I was sick. So I said fuck it and got what I knew wasn't going to be as good. I sit on an empty wallet now.

They were $60/each.  I know (from reading here) about crushing them and snorting small lines due to potency.

The high to me felt exactly like eating pieces of an 80 mg crushable oxy.

I'm not an expert (and I didn't do much of this in a scientific way) but a Panda 30 seemed equivalent to an OC 80.  Of course OC you take orally and OP you can intranasally and who knows what happens once inside your body.

I know there are two basic types of opioids semisynthetic (oxy/hydro - codone/morphone) and synthetic (fentanyl/methadone).  Check out their molecular structure and it's obvious what class each belongs too.  I'm wondering if the high is mostly attributed to that?

TLDR: I'll take an OC80 (crushable) over OP30 (g77) any time, especially on the darknet where you can easily find OC 80s for $40.  Also because OC-IR 10/15/30 are just the same for me.",1422224225.0

I've been using oxy and dope for the past six years or so. Within my first year, I tried chasing a 30 on foil. My first big hit, was amazing. The rush, the taste, everything. After that day I slowly began to deteriorate. As of today, I've been smoking Roxie's for six years straight everyday. Sometimes 10-15 pills a day on payday but mostly 3-4 daily. My question is, what health problems do any other smokers have. I will say, I've never experienced anything that has eaten me up quite like smoking Roxie's has. My eyes have terrible bags, face sunken in, and sores from scratching. But the physical evidence doesn't matter to me, what's going on in my insides is what's scary. For starters, I can barely breathe at all. I have the worst wheezing cough I've ever heard, and I cough up black daily from the build up in my lungs. Second, I have been having terrible pains in my testicles the part month and I wonder if this was directly correlated somehow to the drug abuse. Also my bladder is very sensitive, I find myself urinating many times a day, with very cloudy urine. My taste buds are nonexistent, from being burned I guess from inhaling the smoke. Everything in my house has black stains on them from he soot. My advice to anyone wishing to try, do not. Worst decision of my life. I cannot wake up out of bed without a piece of foil by my side with a nasty ass last hit of a pill stuck to it. My health had severely plummeted, and my weight has dropped incredibly. I literally look like I'm dying but I just can't for the love of me stop smoking pulls off foil. Anyone else out there had any issues from long term abuse chasing pills? Just looking for someone out there that has been doing it for as long as I have and how it has effected them. ",1422373576.0

Mixed reviews, having your opinion and experience would be appreciated in this thread","Am I (and 4 of my close friends) the only ones that do not have a gelling issue with G series opanas? 

We've been swearing by them since we had a consistent flow for them, and we all agree that they work fantastically. Using a pedegg/microplane/hoseclamp, grinding it as fine as possible and doing small bumps to fully coat the mucous membranes and to not lose any down the throat or with a drip. 

I was on the original Endo stop sign opana 40's back in the day, which is how I first discovered/loved opanas. Once they were phased out, I kinda gave up hope on finding them. I randomly came across the G series, and have enjoyed them ever since. I've let people try that have never had opana, and they understand why people like it so much. 

There are 4 people in my ""circle"" that do them consistently, with no issues, nothing but praise for them. I've let 5 people try them, all with opiate tolerance, and all of them but 1 reported back that it was love at first sniff. 

The type of high from these that is consistently reported across the board of people I know personally is a slow/creeping come up to the peak of euphoria (some people report a ""rush,"" but I suspect it's not so much of what a real ""rush"" is, rather it's just the feeling of euphoria finally overtaking you at the peak) as well as nods, uncontrollably hard nods at higher doses, this lasts for several hours, and as the high is tapering down, you get the ER-type effects of feeling good but no longer high or nodding, and then you get hit with a wave of nods, back to feeling normal, then another wave of nods, and so on until the drug has finally ran it's course.  

I have one friend that swears that he gets no high from it and that they gel up every time. I really don't understand how that's possible (sans the lack of high being tolerance-related, but that has been ruled out), because no one that I know of has any sort of gelling issues with the G-series. I've never even read any reports of the G's gelling up, which is why they are sought after (along with the Actavis/moons.)


Can anyone chime in with their experience with G series opanas? Do you like them? Do you get the type of high you're looking for with them? Have you had gelling issues? If so, did anything resolve them?

I'm wd'ing this week, so of course I had to run to the grocery store to stock up on lope, and I was also hoping to get some dxm while I was there (although I've actually not tried this before, just looking for something to help me not feel like total shit as I have no benzos this time). I was looking for it and when I asked the pharmacist where it was she said they keep it on the shelves now because junkies figured out you could use it to get high. I pretended not to know what she was talking about although I wanted to tell her you can't get high on it, it just mildly helps with wd's because its an opioid, save for a few idiots who think they can get it across the bbb which I don't believe in because its never worked for me. It sucks because I usually like to buy 4 or 5 larger boxes of it so I don't have to be running to the store all week. I asked for 2 of the 48 count boxes and she kind of looked at me weird but whatever. I couldn't get the dxm there then because I didn't want her to refuse me service. Of course there are other stores in my area that carry both of these things but they certainly aren't as cheap as this place, and it's just concerning to see this happening. I hope this is just one store, as its not only embarrassing to have to ask the pharmacist for this but its kinda important to be able to really stock up on this stuff during wd's.

It all started a few months ago. I copped a half g of what I thought was really good dope. Long story short, I woke up 3 days later in the hospital, and stayed for a total of 12 days. As it turns out, the ""dope"" I had got killed a few other people and put several in the hospital. It was purely fentanyl/rat poison as one autopsy showed. Anyways somehow I got severe nerve damage in my left arm (my dominant arm) and couldnt use it at all for about 4 months.

Besides that, my kidneys and liver were all on the verge of failure, I had a good chance of severe brain damage, and possibly to go blind in one eye. I know, it sounds like a shit show. Anyways, I came out of the hospital only with the nerve damage. enlightened to forever stop doing dope...or so I thought. I went 115 days sober and IM FALLING BACK IN IT.

It's irresistable. There is nothing better. Why do I always let my addict mind win?? I want to stop... but I NEVER want to stop... GAHHHH

Also I noticed they don't have a ridge around the edge like most all of the past ones I've gotten have had. I'm no noob to these but it really has me stumped since they taste weird and they feel like doing hydrdocpdone.  At least these has to be some opiate  . It because I've been doing these for the past 48 hours and am not yet experiencing any w/d.  Am I just being paranoid or are they vitamins?  Last thing throwing me off is color. The i aide is just one shade lighter than the outside. (See second pic) Seems they are brighter than the batch I just got which I know are real because I take the woman to get her script filled at the local pharmacy.  I did the last one on my way to cop these so until next month I have no frame of reference aside from how they make me feel and pics if legit ones online.  IF they are fake then my hat is off to the manufacturer.  Not only do they look AMAZING, they actually fuck me up.

http://www.rxlist.com/roxicodone-drug/clinical-pharmacology.htm

The absorption rate of our favorite blue and greens (also called bioavailability) is WAY higher than other brands. 
 The relative oral bioavailability of ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, compared to the 5 mg ROXICODONE (oxycodone hydrochloride) ® tablets, is 96% and 101% respectively 
For comparison for a percocet the  The relative oral bioavailability is 67% through 87%

What that means is when you take an oral Percocet you get between 67% and 87% of the drug.  The rest is lost to your body metabolism process.   The Roxicodone is basically 100%.  


A few words you want to know:

bioavailability:
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bioavailability
the degree and rate at which a substance (as a drug) is absorbed into a living system or is made available at the site of physiological activity

Half Life:
https://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Half-life
The half-life of a substance, usually denoted by t1/2, is the time taken for half of the dose to be eliminated or metabolised. The shorter the half-life of a drug, the quicker it is eliminated. The half life of a drug can be influenced by many individual factors, such as metabolic, and genetic.

Pills are intended to be eaten orally.   So you get an oral bioavailability score.  Typically injection gives the highest bioavailability.   So I was surprised by that score on the Roxicodones.   People that snot Roxis actually LOSE bioavailability, simply because the powder is not processed by the body and will potentially come out the nose, getting stuck in your sinus, of course they get the IMMEDIATE effect of it hitting their blood stream.  Where as an injection of Roxi would produce a 100% bioavailability AND also hit your blood stream in the fastest possible way.

I now have a genuine desire to quit.,"I say this to you with a headache and a head that keeps almost falling off its shoulders, eyes that can't stay open (I had to rewrite most of these words) and have been heaving over the toilet. It's 7:15 and I need to get off my ass and drive to work; I know I oughn't, but \i'll tsk it sd vstfo - but \i'll take it carefully as I can and slowly. (see how bad I type?)

I've missed a fair amount of work in the past two weeks, and this is getting *really* out of control. I don't want to get fired, and I'm scared that'll happen soon unless I can show I'm comitted to making changes. Work is definitely not a reason to live for me - I cannot undestand how anyone could ever have that idea ad thought process. When I first started, heroin *was* the reason for living. It was the only thing that offered me joy. That's still true, but it's also the only thing keeping me going because of [ainful wd. 

I'd been told to take a few days off earlier this week, and that included going to the exchange and asking about how I could fo about getting *help*. I also thank very much my friend who has visited me and helped me and listened to me and genuinely cares. It's very rare tjat O#ve fe;t in a situation such as that one.

I wanna quit now anyway, cos its obvious its causing more problems than good. I felt sick last night after counting up how much I was *actually* using on an average day - it was about double what I'd thought. The amount that made me almost OD not long ago is now like half of what I need for a good hit. Now that I'm writing down everything I use, I'll make even more of an effort not to let it increase. I thought I was keeping it steady anyway, but nope... 

I have to work out a planned detox somehow. I can't stand feeling sick and neirher can I tolerate tje pain. I woke up in the middle of the night and used ~0.1g at ~3am, thinking it'd keep me good and let me sleep off the nods so I could be not-tired when driving, and I woke up again at 6:30 feeling sick already. That was when it got to me that I need to make some serious changes. Instead of using and making myself more noddy for the drive, I put away all my works - my scales and sharps bin and empty bags and citric, cookers, rigs... put it all away in a drawer and moved my laptop onto my desk, so I can sit here and type and hopefully stay awake more easilt rhan if I was sitting with the la[top on my bed. I still have my little 'emergency box' with the stuff to prep a shot - in my bag, but I don't have it all out on my desk facing me and tempting me. It was weird; I felt sck whilst cleaing up the whole thing.

I could do with some support but I have very little care for things like 12 steps and anstinence.. idk any other subreddits that might be good, as I have almost no IRL people I can talk to. I won't ever condemn anyone for using or for not wanting to quit; it's a legitimate choice that I also made for a while when I could enjoy it, and not just use because I *needed* to for taking the pain away. It's caused me to have weird disturbing thoughts and makes me spend my whole days asleep, I hate spending the time asleep in a nod - if I could have a cure for just that, it'd practically be a problem solved as its the thing that's fucking me up the worst. Still, not the only symptom, ec etc. 

Ok so it's 8 now and I really do need to go. I hope this wasn't too bothersome and out of place; as I said, I'd never condemn someone for using 0 for making the same choices and having the same coping strategies as I did. That's a problem thoguh - I don't have any better coping stategies... I hate life and don't know how to cope with it; hence I use I can't get back into that as it'll eventually cost me my job.

I just recently started shooting more than once every few months, so until now I have never really had very many cottons to recycle (is it kosher to call it recycling?) until now. I kinda mis calculated and thought I had more dope than what I did for today and ended up scrapping bags this morning, so later in the day, when that sick feeling we all know too well hit I thought I was fucked! Then I got to thinking about it and I had several cottons left over from earlier in the week and last week. One of the guys I work with told me not to do it bec it gives him the shakes and sweats when he does it. I didn't listen, and out them all in my spoon and wet them down and squeezed the shit out of them and sucked it up.. I didn't get high, but I did feel a little rush and I felt a ton better so I guess it somewhat worked.

My question to you guys is this..do you do cotton shots? How do you keep from getting cotton fever if you do? I always squeeze my cottons almost dry when I do a normal shot and my buddy also told me that since I do that I prob won't get anything, but I did, so how does this work? Like I said I am fairly new to this so excuse my ignorance, plus it's still not an all the time thing, and when I get pills again instead of dope I will go back to exclusively snorting cause they are way too hard to shoot and dope is way too expensive where I live!

So I received some AF from a friend. I know legality is ify, etc. I also understand its strength.

I'm curious as to if anyone on here has made a nasal mix with AF. I have made it with Fentanyl Citrate and even Fentanyl (though it didn't mix as well). Would I need to (somehow) make it citrate first? Then, is anyone familiar with the mix amount to make it equivalent with, say, Lazanda?

The reason I like this stuff is because it is stronger. I know what it is so I can take a smaller dose. Or, if I want to mix it with something else, a little bit can amplify the effects of whatever opiate.

On that note, does anyone know how much of this mixed with, say Mannitol, would be approximately a bag fo East Coast ""pretty good"" dope? I know there is no exact science, but estimates would be great. 

This is going to sound bad, but believe me, it's not. This was a gift for a missed birthday. And I can't help but to wonder... anyone know approximate street values of a G of AF?

I'm a recent IV BTH user (previously smoked and previous to that did pills). In any case, I thought I had been pooping fairly regularly but I guess I thought wrong. Well, this morning I felt like I was trying to push a fire truck out of my anus. I had to get to work, though, so I took some milk of magnesia and also tried to manually get some of it out with my finger (gross, I know). I got some of the clay poo out, but some remained but I was good enough to suck it up and go to work.

In any case, the rest of whatever the fuck is up there is sitting heavy on my piles-covered rectum and I'm in pain. I'm in so much pain that I can't relax enough to urinate. I've tried to claw more of it out but to no avail. 

I tried putting bisacodyl supps up there with no result. Is this ER worthy? Further, I haven't used since early this morning because I didn't want to make the problem worse, but will it really? I feel like the deed is already done and the clay shit is already at the gate and I may as well just try to ease my pain now.

Hello. I am 21 years old and I am a heroin fanatic since I was 18.... I never IV'ed, just snort. I recently moved to a new location and they have some really good tar (supposedly). I'm from philly so I just have experience with #4/ECP/powder. 

I find the tar interesting but very very difficult to work with. I copped a gram, and it's like little black/dark brown pebbles that smell very very vinegary and tastes like it too. It seems to be good quality although I have zero idea. It is sticky too when touched (not super moist though). It looks like good stuff although this is my first time seeing it so what do I know. There is some little crumbs in the bag, not sure if I can snort it or will it be nasty/inefficient? I don't want to make monkey water. But I have heard that BTH is #3 heroin and needs water for bioavailability.

My report: I used 5x5 reynolds aluminum foil. I used a plastic straw (the big kinds that are used for the bubble tea drinks, I don't have access to one of the glass tooters so this will have to do.... it hasn't melted or anything so I think it's okay). I put a little dab (50mg I guess?) and put the lighter under and try and inhale it, although alot of it is wasted since I see smoke escaping a lot. 

I feel pretty euphoric/high quickly, however I prefer #4 for sure due to the convenience/ease of just opening a bag and making a line. Plus it lasts longer too. Maybe I'm not doing this technique correctly though. I don't see much smoke when I exhale, I hold it in for 2-3 sec

A few things I am concerned about:

1. **This is my biggest concern. After smoking 3-5 hits within a 5 minute period, I go outside and randomly I get this olfactory reaction where it smells like the heroin I smoked... like a burnt vinegar sort of thing... is this normal? Kind of freaked me out... I smelled my clothes and they didn't wreak of it, so it is strange that my olfactory senses are smelling that? Is this normal to smell heroin in a different area with zero heroin smoke after smoking it? This happened when I was in the car (with no bth smoke) and outside (with no bth smoke) and eating dinner somwhere (with no bth smoke...) its very random too it goes away but am I damaging something cause it's very odd.**

2. Is there any brain damage from inhaling the aluminum foil fumes? I am surely inhaling some of that probably... I don't want alzheimer's disease and read that aluminum is controversial whether or not it is really damaging... but I don't inject so this is the only method I know :3... snorting it seems very nasty imo.

3. Is there a good tutorial/technique to smoke the bth (alone, not with a partner)? I see pictures of the foil of people smoking it and it's like a black maze. Mine is just a dot, it doesn't trail. Maybe because I'm using like 75mg max for each dab I put on the foil.
Been using this guide so far, http://www.heroinhelper.com/user/admin/smoke.shtml - It recommends a toilet paper roll as the tooter for solo use so you don't lose any however I don't have 3 hands. I got one hand on the lighter, one hand in the foil, and the tooter in my mouth.Cant hold a toilet paper roll in my mouth lol

4. Is it normal that the shiny side (I put the dab of bth on the dull side) is all black/nasty looking? I touch it and black soot comes off, yuck... I try to keep the flame far away but I can't tell when smoking it since I am doing it alone. 

5. Does the bth smoke linger on your clothes like cigarette smoke?

So far bth is nice, however I strongly prefer high quality #4 so far. Hoping if someone experienced with bth can help me out and make me have a better experience",1422586790.0

Needless to say I relapse, after doing a small amount as a tester I decided to double the dose to get the full effect. I'm in my room sitting on my bed and the next thing I know I am on the floor surrounded by paramedics. They told me, in no uncertain terms, that I  was extremely close to death. I was given CPR through one of those plastic tubes which is pushed quite far into your throat. My roommate had found me after hearing a huge bang and saw me with my head under the TV stand, I must have fell backwards and smashed my head off it. They gave me naloxone and blue lighted the 20 minute drive to the hospital. I was constantly falling out in the ambulance and whilst I was on the resuscitation ward. After 10 hours of me being there I was alert and no longer nodding off. They asked me to stay overnight but as it was 8pm I decided to discharge myself swearing to both the staff and my family that I would never do it again...

It's Wednesday afternoon and I'm on my way to an NA meeting and I suddenly have a great idea- I'll replace the heroin that the paramedics threw away yesterday and use it another day (yea right. My thought patterns are seriously fucked up if you hadn't guessed). Instead of doing this I decided to go into the local mall toilet and shoot up in there before I go to the meeting (I kept telling myself that I would go, I doubt I would have). I cook up half a bag and shoot up. I leave all of my kit, xanax and heroin on top of my rucksack. Next thing I know is I'm being woken up by 2 paramedics and the mall manager. They shoot me full of naloxone (I didn't realise until I got out of hospital that they have cut open my 70 pound hoody, t shirt and for some reason removed my nipple bar (piercing), then they stick me in a wheelchair and roll me through a packed mall whilst I'm shivering like a lunatic from the shit in my veins. Again,they tell me that I was very close to death and if it wasn't for the fact that someone had seen my trainers sticking through the bottom of the cubicle I would have been found too late and died. Once I got to the hospital some of the staff recognised me from the day before. Fuck that was embarrassing. I thanked everyone involved for saving my life. I'm still shook up and can't believe how little the amount of heroin was that brought me so close to death. I was an idiot and have brought extra pain upon my family. Don't make the same mistake(s) I have made guys. it's eaiser than you think.
