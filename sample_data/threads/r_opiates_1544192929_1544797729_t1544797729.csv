This has been a long and tiring time. So after making it there and back safely, but getting home to find out I had been sold packs of cut and not dope... I've finally gotten well, high even, so I'm gonna tell this story of karmic retribution. Hopefully you are entertained by my hypothetical situation... 

After 3 long days of working, being too busy and not having ride nor reason to go down to The Hood, sickness getting worse and worse, desperation started to sink in. I concocted a plan to steal my grandfather's car in the middle of the night to go cop. I knew it was a massive risk, I could lose my living situation and ruin the trust and relationships i had gained back with my family after years of drug use. I could lose my freedom as I don't have a license, and presumably I'd be driving with drugs in the car, possibly with paraphernalia and high on the way back.

The plan started out as basically a dopesick fantasy of let's somehow get the key and then take the car. Then I really started to consider it.... But how would I pull that off? well let's start by getting the key, and if I can actually do that, the rest will make sense. He's got a bunch of shit on his keychain so when he wasn't looking, I snatched just The car key, sliding it off of the key ring, figuring he wouldn't notice since there are so many other keys. It was a gamble, but it worked. He didn't notice. 

Now I had to think about how I was gonna slip out in His car without him noticing that its gone, along with myself. I thought about the situation. His car is almost silent when it's turned on, and the garage door is brand new, so it too is silent. You can't hear either one in the house, not even right next to The door. He's in the living room watching television, so he would see me go into the garage. I decided that I would leave when he was asleep later tonight. His room is on the other side of the house entirely so there's no way he would be able to hear me leaving in his car, especially if he wasn't awake. 

He finally goes to His room around midnight.. The second I heard snoring, I made my move. I opened the door to the garage slowly and quietly, and I walked out to the car. I can still hear snoring. I smile to myself and close the door to the house. I get in the car and slowly close the door, not wanting to make too much noise. It wasn't closed all the way but it was closed enough for now. I opened the garage with the garage door opener on the visor in the car and turned the key. This is it I'm 100% going! I'm getting well tonight after 3 long days of sickness. I couldn't be more excited.

I pull the car out of the garage and close the door again. I pull out of the subdivision into the main road, and I drive a few miles to the freeway. I hope on, then turn on some Christmas music and drive the half hour drive to the hood. I was the only car in the highway for most of the trip. I turned on the windshield wipers. They said it was supposed to show tonight, lucky for me that it's too warm and it's raining slightly instead.

I get to my exit and pull off, making a few turns before I get to the street I know so well. I had been coming here for years, first to the spot across the street, unprofessional place with no deals, always getting raided. One day they were out of dope and the girl I was hanging out with who lives there told me I could go across the street to the side door and it's another dope spot. 

That was about six and a half years ago and I've been going there ever since. This dope house was the safest dope house you could imagine. This guy ran it but was never there cause he had workers. They worked in shifts and it was 24/7/365. You just knock on the door. This door was barricaded just in case the cops tried to break it down... But that's as never gonna happen because of monthly payoffs to the local precincts narcotics division. This guy had this street on lock. 

Speaking of safe, this dboy pays people in dope to bring him as much narcan as they can. He sees this shit as a business and respects the customer, treating them well if they are big spenders and long time clients. Anyways, after walking in the barricaded door, you have stairs to your right and a door to the basement opposite, along with a hallway and series of rooms where the employees live. The stairs to the next floor take you up into another hallway with two doors, one into another employee room and the other into the hangout spots. Two rooms with tables and sterile water packs, bags of cotton from the exchange, and alcohol pads. There was a third room too, another employee room (this business employs about ten people, one of the only job opportunities in the area) but this employee sells new rigs. I

There was graffiti on the walls, so and so was here, rip, no begging, one day at a time, all kinds of addict shit. It was sorta dirty, slightly grimy, pure hood spot. It was heaven on earth. This time I just grabbed my shit and dipped, but normally I would run upstairs and sit at those tables, sometimes doing a small shot and leaving, other times doing a nice big shot and lighting a cigarette, relaxing and nodding for a few hours, sometimes talking shit with the other clientele. 

I hopped back on the highway,racing home to do a shot, but using cruise control to stay the speed limit, not wanting to risk getting pulled over and going to jail sick. I pulled off and I made it back safely. I snuck back into the house and ran to my room to fix up. Threw a pack in my spoon and mixed up. Pulled the solution into my rig and tied off, hitting my eager vein with ease after registering, seeing the red plume of blood slipping into the syringe. 3...2...1... And... Still dopesick? What's going on?

I shot all the rest of the packs... Nothing. After all that, I got sold cut?? I thought about karma for hours, wondering what the odds where that after pulling off such a maneuver it just so happened to be the one time my plug got ripped off..ever... Going through a fairly new connection for him, His junkie testing the bag was in on the scheme.. 

I couldn't believe it. What a nightmare. I tried to sleep, having to work in the morning, but also potentially having a ride to a nearby town I could take a bus to the hood from. I texted my plug to let him know what happened. He told me if I could get down there again that he would do something for me on him. 

I actually fell asleep somehow, but waking up a few hours later soaked in sweat after having a dope dream. I went to work, tortured by my brain and body screaming for dope, my actual chronic pain feeling ten times worse than normal. I make it through a grueling shift and get picked up, to be dropped off in the town next to the city. I quickly take a bus to the crossroads I cop at. 

I get back to the spot, feeling deja vu for some reason. The worker calls my plug and runs to grab reimbursement packs from the basement. I drag myself upstarts and finally get myself well. Feeling pins and needles along with hunger as my body normalizes. I light up a smoke and enjoy a nod, a nice surprise from doing just half a pack expecting only to get well. There seems to be no problem in the world for a few moments. I leave the trap and head home, finally well, big goofy smile on my face, wishing I would have just waited to begin with, but glad to not feel the pain for another few days...

I was prescribed 10/325 percocet several years ago and I had taken anywhere from 3-4 a day. 

I had a really terrible autoimmune arthritis just show up out of the blue and it was so bad I couldn't even get out of bed for nearly a year until they figured it out.  

Anyway, to the point.  I took these pills religiously for several years and the arthritis would come and go after I started taking a biologic.  I felt a lot of pain and misery even between the biologic but functional.

I decided that I did not want to take opiates anymore so I quit them a month ago.  I must say the entire process was not a pleasant affair, the first week forget it.   

Even at a month I have difficulty getting to sleep.  I am currently sleeping every other night and not when I want to.  I sit in bed 10 hours sometimes trying and can't.

That isn't why I am here asking though, just thought i would share that miserable part.  The real reason I am here is that the pain I experienced daily has vanished since I have stopped taking them.

I thought perhaps the pain was from joint damage before the biologic but nope, it's gone now.  All those years taking those things I think might have been caused from taking them.

Seems odd right?  Any thoughts?

I did once about 10 years ago on bluelight forums I think they were called and was told to ‚Äústop lying and inciting fear‚Äù. However, in the last decade it‚Äôs become far more prevalent and there‚Äôs been way more studies. 

So from in 2004 I was diagnosed with small cell liver cancer. I was prescribed OC 80s and Lortab 10/500 (Vicodin) for breakthrough pain. Dr. Would never increase my OC, but would give me all the lortab I wanted. Fast forward three years to 2007  and I was taking approximately 10-12 lortab a day which equals around 5-6000 mgs of Tylenol a day. It was about this time of year and I went to visit my parents in eastern wa. I started noticing really bad tinitis in my ears and when I stood up or when I walked my balance was all over the place. The closest thing I could describe it as was if felt like I was constantly under water. 

I was watching tv in my room at my parents and my dad comes in and said ‚Äúdo you realize your tv in here is louder than the tv in the living room?‚Äù We can‚Äôt hear our tv over yours. I had no idea. My husband said to me earlier that day that he‚Äôs had to repeat himself to me multiple times to get me to hear him. Huh, off to the emergency room. 

ER doc said oh ya must be and inner ear infection. Here‚Äôs some steroids and abx. Ok cool go him start meds. Next day I wake up and the best way I can describe what I heard was a balloon slowly letting out air.  Not so it squeaked, just a rushing of air. Then nothing. Back to ER, ok stronger abx more prednisone. It will slowly come back. I never heard another sound naturally. The Tylenol toxicity that was eventually diagnosed after getting to an otolaryngologist caused me to go from perfect hearing to nothing in less than 3 weeks. 

My kids were 8, 3, and 3.  Try getting your 3 year olds to understand mommy‚Äôs ears don‚Äôt work anymore. If you want to talk to her, you have to look at her so she can try and read your lips. My 8 year old had to grow up quick. She became the third parent. She felt like she couldn‚Äôt go out and play if my husband was at work for fear of one of the twins falling and hurting themselves and I wouldn‚Äôt hear. I was totally deaf for 10 months. Then I received a cochlear implant in my right ear. Which allows me to hear about 50% of normal in one ear. Music doesn‚Äôt exist for me anymore because my implant only allows me to hear about 23 different tones. So overlapping sounds are impossible and music in only 23 tones sounds horrible. It‚Äôs difficult for me to hear in restaurants, I tried to go to a comedy show, which didn‚Äôt work because people laughing made it so I couldn‚Äôt hear the comedian continue their bit. I have to make sure a movie theater offers CC before I can go to a movie, which is much better than a decade ago. 

I just beg you. If you‚Äôre ingesting a lot of Tylenol...stop. Don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not worth it. I was 27 when I lost my hearing. I beat small cell liver cancer, thank God, one of the highest mortality rates of any cancer. So losing my hearing could be much worse, but it didn‚Äôt have to happen. If you are noticing tinnitus stop now. It‚Äôs not worth it. I know I‚Äôm repeating myself, but being deaf, losing one of my senses, is one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to deal with. I was depressed for a long time. Thank God for my family. Be safe everyone. ",1544773671.0

40

I ride the bus over to the old trap motel room.

But I get off a few blocks up from the stop that‚Äôs closest to it, so I can get something to eat at McDonald‚Äôs. When I get up to the counter a pretty girl takes my order which is for two sausage biscuits, a small orange juice and a cup of coffee. She puts a tray on the counter and my food and drinks on top of it. I ask for a few packets of grape jelly, because sausage biscuits with grape jelly are my favorite to eat for breakfast, and so I go sit at a table over in the corner and open the wrappers of the sandwiches and put jelly on them and then squirt the other packet onto the paper so I can dip the sausage biscuits right into some extra jelly. They really are my favorite thing to eat for breakfast. One time, when I was starving and homeless on the street, this guy woke me up with a five-dollar bill and gave me a few cigarettes. I‚Äôd been sleeping under the overhang of a strip mall in front of a nail salon. It was raining. Instead of using that money for another pack of cigarettes or waiting to get another few bucks to go in on a bag with someone so that I could get well, I walked directly to McDonald‚Äôs to buy and eat five sausage biscuits with grape jelly in a row. 

So, I‚Äôm sitting there scarfing my food the way I always do so that I can barely even breathe and choke on it once or twice between slurping at the orange juice. It‚Äôs still dark outside. Traffic is slow to move on Sunday mornings like this, but eventually it‚Äôll take off. The sky has a few violet veins of what look to be promises of daylight running through the clouds, and across from me at another table a woman holds her cup of coffee in a pair of dirty skeleton hands. She wears a purple hoodie that‚Äôs in good condition, but a little dirty. I can tell she‚Äôs homeless and high. There‚Äôs that blissful crimp of her lips on her face and the pin pricked pupils that heroin gives people. For me it‚Äôs easy to see. It‚Äôs like an aura of warm glamour shot fuzz that she wears, and I can see. The lady is pretty, still in her early 40s I would guess with big eyes and no wrinkles but the obvious wear and tear of life on drugs and the streets. The fact that she‚Äôs high so early in the day means that she‚Äôs got something figured out. When I was on the streets, I was always sick in the morning and had to hit licks to come up for the day. But, then again, girls fair better than men in that regard out here. They have what is arguably the most sought-after commodity in the history of the world, but it‚Äôs not fun living like that however good the drugs feel. It all comes at a heavy price.  

After eating I make it up to the old trap motel room, number 127 at the Lindell Motor Lodge. It stinks as badly as it ever did, so I hear. I can‚Äôt tell, though. That‚Äôs just what the customers say. The gun I bought when I first started selling and living here lives under the bed. It just doesn‚Äôt feel necessary for me to be toting that thing around everywhere I go. I still want to have it. I just don‚Äôt want to have it with me, so I leave it here. Makes me feel better. Even if it doesn‚Äôt make sense.

Customers show up one by one. Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. Eddie is in and out every morning, but I‚Äôm always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. I usually only sit there until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit there, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That‚Äôs every day and not counting the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or even Martin from me after I‚Äôm done here. Sal shows up at nine or so and walks right in. I always meet him at Dee Dee‚Äôs place. Never here. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Junky Vonnegut?‚Äù The way he says it isn‚Äôt even the same.

‚ÄúSup, Sal?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.‚Äù He usually only gets a couple grams at the most. 

‚ÄúYeah. I think I can do that for you. What were you with Sharky for last night?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We‚Äôve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That‚Äôs why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know you guys were that tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Man. What? You think I‚Äôd just drop some stranger off in your lap like that, man? Not me!‚Äù

‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt know. What you looking for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI need a zip.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn ounce?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

I get the scale out and weigh one out for him out of the bag I just got from Old Man earlier this morning. Sal holds it up and studies it. He laughs.

‚ÄúNice, man. Real nice.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I gotta bust out of here. Hit me up later. Or I‚Äôll hit you up.‚Äù

So I recently found an old bottle of 5/325 hydros at my house, prescribed from earlier this year. I ended up never taking them and forgot about them. In the past I've enjoyed small doses of opiates here and there, mostly codeine and hydrocodone. I remember I used to take 20mg of hydro and I would have one hell of a nod. This time around I'm not getting any positive effects whatsoever. Just very spacey and nauseas. It almost feels as though I have a concussion.

Yesterday I grabbed two, split the pills in half and took them in the afternoon. An hour or so later I just felt tired and like I was gonna vomit. I shrugged it off as my first time doing any opiates in a couple years so I waited 8 hours, did a proper CWE (to be clear, I have lots of experience with CWE, so this is not the issue), and took 15mg worth, and had the same effect, only stronger. No euphoria, no warm feeling. Only nausea and, well, pain killing effects, although not pleasant at all. I tried smoking some low THC high CBD cannabis to relieve the nausea, only for it to perpetuate the gross feeling.

Earlier this afternoon I thought that I would try something right in the middle, and worried that it was a problem with my CWE, simply took two and a half pills (12.5mg hydro, 816mg APAP). I felt sedated, sure, but it was that same horrible feeling. Nausea, no warmth, heavy head, sedated, mild headache, etc. Everything you would associate with opiates if you took out all of the positive effects.

Anyone else experience this? You know, maybe this is a good thing. I've never been one to grow to habituate opiate use, but no one is immune to it's allure when things are working as expected with the drug. Even so, I would love to know if anyone else has felt anything similar to this.

Thanks in advance.

I chuckle and upvote the memes like ""when he says he's about to pull up, he's just leaving the house"" etc. cause I have had to deal with that on occasion with my plug and backup dealers, but for the most part my dealer rocks!

I've been going to him/her mostly daily for about 2.5 years now, let's call him Bub, but he got popped a year ago and now his girl runs it, so she goes by Miss Bub. They run a real professional, nice business with good deals and fast runners (I've only met the actual Bubs a few times). In the daily trips for 2.5 years, there's been maybe 3 days they weren't good and I had to use a backup, maybe 3 more when the phone was off for a few hours but came back on. She's consistently open from 7am-11pm (sometimes if I'm late I'll use a backup, which always makes me appreciate my plug more). I rarely wait more than 20min at the spot, usually 10, and often the runner is there waiting for me!!

Not only that, they've had consistently good shit this whole time, it's just honestly my favorite in this area, and because I'm such a good customer, I can ask for a front once, sometimes even TWICE a week, typically in the mornings cause they know I'm coming back later with money. (The front is usually just 2 dime bags but it gets me well till I can get more cash). No expectation to pay it back, and she's never said no to me. I'd say on average I ask for that once a week, but buy a good amount 6/7 times a week. If I do have to wait a while, they throw in extra typically.

I decided to make this post cause she just sent out a text with her ""Christmas specials"" lol and they're some damn good deals! I know I can get a great deal at 7am sharp tomorrow morning. It's just nice not having to deal with middles and shit plugs. I know cause some of my backups are just slow, greedy, unprofessional, and their shit is inconsistent.

My family doesn't remotely resemble anything that it was when she was still here. I use to love the holidays and each year since she has passed has gotten worse and only made me resent them more and more. I miss her so much, we were really close. She was the most awesome lady, no judgement ever only love! My home was always open to my friends, dinner was made every night and it was always enough for 10 people! Even as I got older, right before I moved out, she would still wait up in the living room usually fast asleep by the time I got home but I would always go check (my room was separate from the main house) and sure enough she was there just to make sure I got home safe and to ask me how my day was and remind me she loved me. My father is another topic, but let's just say he was probably the worst person who reacted in the most awful kind of way. He was not there for me or my sister, he kicked us out of the house in the pouring rain 2 days before Thanksgiving all bc I stood up to him in defense of my mom as he had some mental breakdown and verbally degraded his dying wife of 36 years who was to sick from chemo to do anything more than ball her eyes out from the horrible things coming out of his mouth. I don't care who you are, you will not speak to a woman, much less my mother, in that kind of way without me having something to say about it. He attacked me, placed his hands around my throat as to strangle me, only to have me remove his hands and hold him by the wrist just for him to try and pull back to I assume swing on me so we fell to the ground. He got up and called the cops saying I assaulted him (he's a cop btw) they could see he was clearly off his rocker but nevertheless we were given 2 hrs to pack our entire lives into my truck, trailer, sister car, fiance's car and be gone to the streets. Us 3 along with 11-3 week old English bulldogs (me and the fiance did breeding on the side). My family is gone now, I've since gone from a insane oxy/coke addiction of 10 years to now banging bth for the past 3..... She would be so heart broken to know where I'm at in life. My father ruined my finances as we were in business together (family owned construction company of 44 years) stole over 15k from me, tried to have me shut down with all material vendors as to cripple me from being able to work, shit talks me to no end, but he's still my dad and just bc I don't like him I will always love him. I just hate that I find myself wishing it was him gone and not her.... I feel awful to even type it and read it. I'm sorry for the vent post Fam. You guys after the only ones who understand pain and using to escape. I just want to do a issue and go to bed, waking up in a couple days so I can try to get past this broken heart that seems to only hurt more, never getting better with time.

I know everything‚Äôs cut with Dormin usually in my area. A lot of my dealers are too lazy to remove the red specs. Of course there may be many other cuts but I know of this one being the most prominent.

This totally sounds like I‚Äôm trying to whip up some fake dope and rip people off. I‚Äôm actually not. I would probably just be honest about that here. Actually been on subs for a while, but I use every few weeks for a couple days.

I‚Äôve had 2 dealers that often sell good product sell me this garbage. When confronted, the main dude I go to was super honest about it being bunk (he blamed his boy for giving him fake shit unknowingly) and ended up hooking me up the next time (with good shit).

I‚Äôm just curious how it‚Äôs possible that this shit looks identical to ECP. I know a tan powder isn‚Äôt crazy but it‚Äôs seriously eerily similar. 

Talked to an ex-dealer from the area that I‚Äôm cool with when it happened and she said that they probably used Dormin and baked it in the oven. 

Idk though... I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt have looked like that. 

Thinking about it... I‚Äôve actually had a third dealer dealer do the same thing but rock it back up and everything. Completely bunk but looked so fire lol.

My friend got basically robbed of .60 of some bth last week from this dude I used to go thru, back in my using days. She paid him for a G and he only gave her .40 and yes, she gave him the $ 1st without checking the weight.

As you all can imagine he's been ghosting her and stringing her along saying he's gonna make it right, blah, blah, blah.

Well guess who just came thru for her bigtime???
Moi!
I texted him telling him I'd buy a G from him if he added the .60 he owes her to it so basically giving him $80 for 1.60.

I just met him and he gets in my car and says there's only 1.40 but I'll get you the rest, I promise! Yeah, right m, fuckface, total bs. I then proceeded to tell him to just weigh out .60 cuz I'm not buying shit from him and to hurry up and weigh it out cuz I'm fuming, pissed he did that to her! He gets super agro and pissed off and is screaming at me saying fuck you, don't ever call me again, blah, blah, blah.

I drove away with around .55 so I'm super happy and very , very proud if myself! Just to add to the story, I've been on MMT for a little over 3 years now and don't use nor have I used since starting on methadone. Nice thing is, is that I wasn't even tempted to do any of the bth, at all so I'm super proud of that little victory as well!

I dedicate this post to all of us who've been fucked over, robbed, stolen from, lied to, strung along, etc, etc over the years, it's the small little victories that count once in awhile, right?

Not strictly opiate related, but I suppose I‚Äôll be prescribing them so there‚Äôs the nexus to make it somewhat pertinent. 

The opportunity exists for me to take a medical student on a clinical placement in my practice. 

I‚Äôm somewhat ambivalent to the idea. On one hand, I‚Äôll have someone who can talk to the patients, run out for coffees, is keen, uncorrupted & not yet jaded by life in general or the practice of medicine specifically. 

They‚Äôll be in a couple of days a week & I‚Äôd be responsible for formulating a basic curriculum and providing some structure. 

Not simply a ‚Äúsit there, shut up & watch what I do‚Äù thing. 

In some ways it‚Äôs a terrific opportunity to be involved in educating and arming the next generation of idealistic young doctors and preparing them to go forth into the world in their chosen profession. 

I do feel somewhat obligated because I‚Äôm just a link in the chain so to speak & feel a responsibility to pass on what I‚Äôve learned & to mentor an unspoiled youngblood.

Plus I was in their shoes once and someone mentored & put up with my youthful exuberance & stupid, inane interrogatives. 

By the same token, I‚Äôm somewhat daunted that what if I fuck it up & they don‚Äôt really learn anything? 

Shit. 

I‚Äôm leaning towards just saying yes and accepting the placement. I do think it‚Äôs the right thing to do & I‚Äôm pretty sure it says somewhere in the Hippocratic oath about passing on knowledge. 

Then again, I‚Äôm pretty sure it also says I have to live a life of chastity and sacrifice a goat to a moon god or something. So yeah, whatevs. 

Given that my own kids ignore me, it might actually be nice to have someone who thinks I‚Äôm awesome and hangs off my every word, soaking up everything like a sponge. 

It‚Äôll be a bit of extra work around the place, but what do my colleagues here, think? 

A noble & worthy opportunity to mould and shape a young, inquisitive mind?

Or a clusterfuck of epic proportions waiting to happen, that will devolve into the poor youngster watching me scream at the printer when it keeps telling me to clear the paper jam in tray 5 when I‚Äôve already cleared that fucker out 9 times already this morning? 

TL/DR:

Do I accept a medical student for placement at my practice or is it not worth the hassle (or they‚Äôll see how disorganised I am and how I keep losing pens etc)?

So my mind is going crazy again. Maybe because of the upcoming holidays. Maybe because I have to see my biological relatives aka ""family"", because I again made plans to visit when I was in a good mood.

So my brain is going nuts. Just one single fucking shot of H... To take my mind off these things. Just to make this shit bearable. But I also know for sure I shouldn't fuck things up as life could be way worse right now.

As for my background: So far I IV other stuff for the love of needles and everything that comes with it... Yet I have never touched any opiates because of the simple fucking reason I never stumbled upon them and I am too fucking shy to talk to strangers. But I so fucking would have if I ever came across the right person at the right time. I have had an obsession with that drug for, I don't know, more than 10 years? Lord knows where that came from, I can't tell. And it's only this one specific drug that seems sooo appealing to me.

So, new place, new people. I just need the guts to approach someone. Yes I wanna do it and yet I know I shouldn't. The reasonable voices say no, but there's that single one screaming so damn loudly. So, yeah. Yes, I absolutely know the answer to ""should I"" is always going to be *NO*. I've spend so many nights browsing the Internet on this topic, I've read your stories and responses in this subreddit. Yet still... one of the voices is still screaming for it. It's like 5 of my personalities are doing everything to contain the one that wants to spiral off into the abyss. I can read so much about why not but I seem unable to make my brain understand it.

I just want my thoughts to shut up. This is exhausting. Make it stop.

So, uhm... any ideas? How do you guys deal with your cravings? And thanks for reading if you made it that far.",1544748299.0

Then 30 mins late took 50 mg promethazine, felt nauseous ever since , 3 hours later ..  been drinking loads of water ,  resting , eat some bread . 

 The reason I took the anti histamine after i had taken the codeine , was I had seen serval people say to take a anti histamine ( promethazine for me ) 30 mins / when you start feeling the high kicking in .

I have never got nauseous before as I usual take the codeine + promethazine together or sometimes take the prom 20 mins before .

I guess people react different ...

My advice never take your anti histamine after dropping ya opiate!!

But damnit I love all of you and things are getting better.

I‚Äôm so stoked right now. My life is falling back into place after I‚Äôve stopped feeling sorry for myself all the time. I‚Äôm finally starting to take the initiative to go out and make things better. Hard work is uncomfortable after getting so used to the instant gratification of getting high all the time.

I‚Äôm starting to remember the feelings that real success and accomplishments bring. It‚Äôs completely opposite of instant gratification. Instead of a temporary false sense of euphoria and comfort, you work hard for a long time and that success makes you feel whole and genuinely happy as a human. It‚Äôs a much better feeling knowing that you deserve the good feelings you have and that you worked for them.

So I‚Äôm 24 years old.

I didn‚Äôt score the ‚Äòbest‚Äô job in the world but I finally have a solid job paying $15.50 / hour and $22.75 overtime. And this job leaves lots of room for moving up in the business and making it a career if it works out.

May not sound like a crazy amount of money. But I need to take what I can get right now. I‚Äôve been a guitar teacher for years and that was really solid money per hour, but it was extremely inconsistent and unreliable. I also gave up most of that work after going to treatment this last time. It‚Äôs also been so hard to get what I had going again.

So I‚Äôve been job hunting for a month or so.  
Just recently had 3 interviews and all of them led to an offer for a position.  
The first two were super low pay. $10.25 an hour  or $9.75... but I needed to take what I could get. It sucks because I have the skills to teach the guitar lessons and make up to $50 an hour; but that doesn‚Äôt translate to many other fields in terms of experience.

I‚Äôm done rambling... just so stoked. Another important thing is that my coworkers and the environment are super legit. In my opinion this has a HUGE impact on the job and honestly the quality of life in general. 

As long as I pass this 9 panel I‚Äôm good to go. Hopefully bupe doesn‚Äôt show up. I know I could use fake piss but I‚Äôd rather not have to deal with all of that.

I have plans to try the new sublocade injections and then taper off completely. Only when I‚Äôm ready. Right now it‚Äôs helping me tremendously so I‚Äôm in no rush to get off.

Sounds silly but I have plans to have my mother managing my finances; I need her to. I‚Äôm not  currently thinking about relapsing, but I don‚Äôt want to even risk it. I know how quickly things can go to shit.",1544726105.0

Supposedly this is a more efficient way to get high, get bigger rush or something like that. I am a bit skeptical, because by the time you draw blood again, the dope would be deep in your system already and even if it weren't, I don't see how would shooting it several times get you higher.

By all accounts my life has been good when I'm clean- I generally smile on a day to day basis and when I relapse I get into a state of desperation almost immediatly. I mean full blown fiend mode kicks in and I'm overdosing and suffering other severe consequences in a matter of days. It's really progressed to where my runs can not be longer than a week or two- and honestly I'm miserable the whole time. 

The thing is I struggle with coping with life- and opiates at some point used to relieve me with that duty. They do not do that anymore. They add depression and a heavy weight of addiction to whatever problems or feelings I may have. When I lost my baby recently I got high immediatly and was immeditately in a worst place than I was before. I got clean for a month after that and couldn't shake the sadness and did the same thing again. Went on a week run and destroyed a lot- ended up in a detox and have been clean for 1.5 months since then. 

I'm getting over the sadness slowly and I have my good and bad days- but I have a great job, great friends, I work a solid recovery program- I see that my life will clearly be pretty good if I don't get high. However, my loneliness and heartbreak since my girl left me (right after the baby thing) makes me want to get high. It doesn't make any sense- I've tried to deal with this problem by getting high and I have direct evidence that it does not work- but I hate feeling this way- and in my mind heroin fixes it. 

However lonely I am without her- heroin will isolate me even further- it causes me to ruminate on my problems, to lose hope, to tell myself I have a reason to get high because of the pain I'm in. It's a positive feedback loop that only increases the pain. 

Idk what the point of this post is other than to vent that its super irritating to fully know that I'm lying to myself but still somewhat believe those lies. Addiction is a bitch mayne. ",1544712117.0

Trying to figure out if using it around dose time is going to effect my oxycodone and how..... and really there is a lack of information online.

I know someone is going to say that it can make you have less of a chance in the off chance you have in the first place of your body converting oxycodone to oxymorphone 

To be honest I never tried oxymorphone and I‚Äôm sure that little automatic random conversion can explain why on occasion you get a nice feel that‚Äôs not always there but I will not base my decision on this.

I also think this a nice thread to have up and can benefit us and beyond to get this straight because I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not the only one that needs to find this out 

So I have 5 slipped discs in my lumbar spine + a lot of other injuries and inflammation with my lower back, hip, got cut down in qty of pills and dose for the moment due to a error and just have to deal with that. Went from 90 7.5 hydro to 60 5mg and I‚Äôm not making it through till it can be fixed back which normally I‚Äôm fine with and it‚Äôs only a couple of weeks that I have to wait but

I‚Äôm pretty sure I may have broken my ankle yesterday and need to make thing stretch and don‚Äôt have a choice for the next 2 weeks 

My back actually hurts worse then my ankle but it‚Äôs starting to get hard to walk, yes you can walk on a broken ankle...at least I can and I have in the last...done it twice actually but that was when I was in middle school and not in my early 30‚Äôs. I more then know it‚Äôs a lot easier then vs now. Not that I‚Äôm old but not much is required then vs now.

TLDR - 

does cbd potentate oxycodone and othet opiates?

What is the effect that it has on them? Is it good, is it bad? 

I know it could effect the ability and off chance that your body can make its own oxymorphone but not much else and there‚Äôs not much available when searching 

Maybe have broken ankle on top of bad back and hip injuries and have to stretch for the next two weeks

Idk if anyone remember me posting some months back about my wife and I trying to get clean, wanted to tell y‚Äôall what happened.

We were using fent (was sold to us as oxy) and got very strung out. We weren‚Äôt paying bills, missing work, and neglecting our daughter. It was bad. 

On September 8th I picked up a sack of 10 and brought it home, we each did a few like normal. I smoked a bowl and went to bed. I woke up randomly at around 2:30 am to find my wife had overdosed. I did everything I could and called an ambulance but it was too late. She had kept doing them after I fell asleep. 

CPS put my daughter with my parents and I moved in with my sister. Since that day I have been sober. I have been going to 12 step meetings and a counselor to help deal with everything.

I‚Äôm now in my own place and back to work. I see my daughter every day or so and I still go to meetings. 

I share this with y‚Äôall not for pity or for some kind of woe is me post, but to warn of the dangers of this game. By all means if you can use responsibly and keep your shit together go for it but please be safe.

I also want to say if you are looking for a way out, there is one. Shit there are multiple ways to get out. You can do this, it‚Äôs not easy but can be done. I myself went straight cold turkey and was in an AA meeting the day after my wife died. Detox sucks I know but you can make it through.

If anyone needs to vent or wants any kind of help, I‚Äôm here and there are multiple people who are willing to listen/help.

I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve been using opiates for years. Last year in April / May I discovered snorting heroin and have been feeling trapped ever since.

I‚Äôm actually on subs now actually and have been for a few months but I still relapse every couple weeks for a couple days at a time. I was planning to get the sublocade injection and thought it would help.

All of this is besides the point though.

I am literally such a piece of shit and I have become everything I never wanted to be. Shortly after my last stint in rehab I was in an IOP.  It just finished a few weeks ago.

Basically I found my mom‚Äôs medicine and knowing that she doesn‚Äôt use it often (absolutely NO excuse) I took a total of 2 scripts of ambien (60 total) and probably like 100 hydros. I was taking a few pills everyday for weeks. When she didn‚Äôt find out I tried to justify it in my head. Well I thought I‚Äôd be ‚Äòsmart‚Äô and replace the empty ambien bottles with Advil. My mom‚Äôs not stupid even though the shape is the same. 

Needless to say, she found out today. And instead of lying this time, I was completely honest. I‚Äôm such a piece of shit. 
What happened to me? Where did I start to go wrong? I‚Äôm seriously such a loser and I have nothing going for me... snooping in my parent‚Äôs room and stealing their medication. Talk about LOW. Fuck me.

Thanks for listening guys. I‚Äôm leaving my house now and going homeless for the first real time. Got layers of clothes, water, and a sleeping bag. So shitty. I was supposed to start a new job tomorrow too. Fucked that up because there‚Äôs no way my mom wants anything to do with me.

And also all my family already knows I‚Äôm a heroin addict. They thought I‚Äôve been doing better but what my mom tells them is going to make me look like the junkie loser that I am.

Fuck this life. I‚Äôm pathetic. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm so numb emotionally but all I can do is cry.

Maybe someone whose been in a similar position and has gotten better can help me out with some solid advice... any hope for me?",1544643929.0

Today I tried to I.V. heroin for the first time.

I fucked up, because I am stupid. My package with insulin needles didn't arrive, so I said fuck it and tried it with a syringe with an extremly thick and long needle. It was so hard to get the needle to puncture the skin, but eventually I was in ""something"". I could move the needle freely around in what felt like a vein, it bled. I wasn't skilled enough to successfully pull back the plunger to see if I was in a vein and after a bit, I said fuck it again and just pushed the plunger.

I did get a little bit of an effect, but only a barely noticable one.

When I pulled the needle out, blood came out very quickly.

My tolerance is low, so I only needed to inject 0.3ml of liquid. Now there is a little bump, it doesn't hurt at all, but it's there, maybe 2mm long, 1mm thick and 1mm tall. I can pinch it, but nothing happens, nothing comes out, or something like that.

He asked if I could hold it for him for a while because he is going away for vacation and doesn‚Äôt want it at his home. 

I‚Äôve experience with opioids. I tried Codeine twice and also used oxycodone a handful of times this year. When I use Oxy I mostly need to take 30/40mg before feeling anything even with zero tolerance. Don‚Äôt now really why i need to take so much but lower dosage don‚Äôt do anything for me !

I am very interested in maybe trying Heroin but I am always concerned of ODing. I don‚Äôt want to die because of a stupid fucking drug so I want to take the safest way possible. I was planning to take a small key bump with the amount of match head and wait 30 min to maybe redose when needed. Is this safe to do this way ?

After about 4 hrs blood started coming out, so I went to the E.R. The doctor was rather snotty to me and was treating me like a drug seeker. I did not ask anyone for meds. I just told them my symptoms. The doctor was like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll just see if you really have blood coming out, as he was putting on his gloves‚Äù. He proceeded to jam a finger in my butt and then his tone changed. He started to get sympathetic and said I was indeed bleeding internally.  They quickly ran blood tests and gave me a CT scan and found nothing, but my diarrhea looked like ground up raw liver so they new I was in pain so I was admitted for more tests. After 4 hrs, I was finally given something for the pain. It was called Nubain. I had not heard of it before. The nurse injected it rather fast. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are supposed to inject narcotics over a 5 min period. It took her less than 30 secs. I was so messed up I was drooling on myself! If it had been anywhere else, I would‚Äôve thought I was overdosing. I nodded out for I think about 20 mins. Then I just felt really high for about an hour and was pain free for 3 hrs total. I was given Nubain every 3 hrs. After the 3rd dose it wasn‚Äôt working as good, but I had no pain . I continued to have bloody diarrhea for the next 24 hrs. Then it subsided. The Gastroenterologist said they couldn‚Äôt find anything. They think it was a bout of Ulcerative Colitis. I was given IV antibiotics and the antifungal Flagyl as a precautionary and sent home the next day. I was sent home with a script of Vicodin to help any residual pain and to wean off the heavy amount of Nubain. I was shocked!! They never send people home with concerns of withdrawal. I ended up saving the 30 Vicodin and used them when my back went out 6 months later. So, has anyone else had this drug called Nubain?

I have a couple of experiences in the past with opioids (Oxy and Codeine) but never really thought of using heroin because the heroin we get here is brown and you can‚Äôt snort it. It‚Äôs more used for smoking or injection wich I have no interest in ! Because this will maybe be the last time that I ever get my hands on white and pure heroin I thought about trying it !

Would it be okay if I try it in the evening (about 20 hours after taking Xanax) or should I better wait until tomorrow ? 

And maybe any Tipps on first Time heroin and best way to snort it ? I am planning on doing small bumps every 15 min until I feel something. Good idea ? 

Thanks for the help and I know how dangerous and addictive heroin is but as I said it will be almost impossible to get my hands on it again so why not try it.

I've searched a bit on Google, but I've gotten somewhat contradicting answers considering how interchangably the ""oxycodone"" and ""oxycontin"" are used. I realize that ""oxycontin"" is a brand of extended release oxycodone. However, what I fail to understand or, rather, what I fail to decide is whether oxycodone (something like percocet) or oxycontin is the right thing for me. 

I've been using morphine for quite a while and recently was given the choice between 40mg oxycodone or 20mg oxycontin. I'm unsure of whether I should go for the former or the latter and was wondering if you guys could give your 5 cents. I'd get 28 pills in both cases. If these sort of posts aren't allowed then sorry.

Edit: Turns out the oxycodone wasn't combined with APAP as I originally thought, so the question is basically 40mg oxycodone IR vs 20mg oxycodone ER. Guess I'll take the former!",1544610752.0

Then my original dboys former runner went into business for himself and I started using him, then out of the blue he went back to work for original dboy and I was blacklisted. ... I ended up finding someone via a forum who I was talking to that through convos we realized we had the same fondness for powder and were local, unfortunately they weren't a plug but more a middle they had good stuff the first few times but it was super pricey on top of that one bag had like IDK pou pori or some shit in it.....

 Ive been scammed and literally had to fight 3 random project teenagers on a supposed cl deal.... So I call them today, I meet them a few blocks from my job he hands me a whole bun to go into the bathroom at Starbucks to try before I buy so I can pick a bag at random to ensure no bait and switch... I try it and meh, doesn't rock my world but idk sniffing it takes a min.... So I buy a half a bun and tell him if it hits I'll see him later... He says he may have something better than that too .. And gives me 2 blue bags along with the 5 white and the tester so basically 8 bags for $50 and after about 20 I do another bag and god dammit man it hits me and its that good dope hit the nod the euphoria and as of now I can tell the long legs.. . needless to say I met him up later and picked up 8 more bags for 70 and ive found a new plug I'm Happy AF with ....

So my first time I had tried Percocet was about a month ago. I usually take adderall to get high but my plugs were all out and we were in a drought. I managed to get my hands on a perk,I think it was 10mg and I railed it right before going to work. I barely felt it, for a little bit. I guess to get a better experience you just gotta relax at home chill and do whatever. Clocked in and at work and I start to feel it a bit more and as it started to come down, I took 1mg of a Xanax and that shit hittt tf out of me. It was like someone put a spell on me and holy shit I began to feel sleepy and drowsy as shit, my friend who works with me was the only one that knew what I was on and told me to just get out, don‚Äôt drive home but told me that I can‚Äôt be here otherwise I‚Äôll definitely get my ass fired. I was nodding while standing up, I was being too fucking reckless and so I told my supervisor that I felt sick and left. I work a 12hr shift from 7pm-7am. When I left work halfway through the shift it was about 1:20 ish. I start my car and turn the heat on, listen to music and then sit back for a little and relax.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I‚Äôm a chronic pain patient (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, and a host of back issues... so it‚Äôs mainly just my joints, bones, and muscles, everywhere in my entire body).  

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

***BACKGROUND:*** My doctor put me on 50mcg Fentanyl patches (I‚Äôd been getting the brand name, Duragesic, because they stick best through showering, sweat, and movement and they seem to have the most steady delivery vs. some of the generics).  I also take six 10mg Hydrocodone pills throughout the day for breakthrough pain.  I was recently put on Medicare through my disability, and my plan (Humana), paid for the first month of Duragesic patches and then sent a letter saying they wouldn‚Äôt do it again, and I was expecting that they just needed a prior auth to demonstrate that I‚Äôd been on the patches for years now and that I‚Äôd taken all the prerequisite medications to justify them but I guess that‚Äôs not happening.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

***The proposed alternatives for the Duragesic patches are:***  

- Morphine ER Tab
- [Xtampza](https://www.empr.com/xtampza-er/drug/34583/) (generic: Oxycodone)
- [Embeda](https://www.empr.com/embeda/drug/34446/) (generic: Morphine sulfate + naltrexone HCl)

I‚Äôve never heard of Xtampza or Embeda before and that makes me nervous.  It took... a long time to finally find the right combination of medications and I‚Äôm still in pain ‚Äî I‚Äôm never *not* in pain, but the patches help to work 24 hours a day and I take two 10mg Hydrocodone in the morning, afternoon, and evening.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I would greatly appreciate any personal advice or recommendations so I can discuss what seems like the best alternative medication with my doctor.  If anyone happens to know the appropriate equivalent dosage for a 50mcg fentanyl patch in an extended release medication, that would also be helpful.  I‚Äôm not sure if maybe a better route is finding a more powerful medication that works all day and night so I don‚Äôt take the Hydrocodone for breakthrough pain as well.

What better than anonymously on a forum full of people who will understand.

This is gonna be a long one, so if you wanna get to the part where I talk about the spiritual experience I had of shitting, just scroll down until you see **TL;DR**. For the shortest version of this post possible just read the **SHIT-TIME** section.

-----------**BACKGROUND**---------------

So I'm not a stranger to constipation, but it's never been this bad. The last time I had constipation that comes even close to what I had last night was about 2-3 years ago. I was drinking [opium tea] daily (back when it was actually strong) and after a month of this I had barely shit. I used magnesium citrate and a hot bath and was able to get it out, and bled for the first time from shitting (which made me want to puke). 

(Edit: I forgot to mention that during the ""opium tea"" constipation I had, I also caught a fuckin stomach bug. It was my 3rd day visiting family and I made some eggs. Turns out the eggs were 3 weeks past their good by date, and my family had just never been damned to throw them away, so I ate them and got sick. I'd wake with a super strong urge to shit and end up pissing out of my ass - I'd straight up shit clear water every day, while the actual shit was stuck and I was constipated. Pretty awful.)

Flash forward now and I haven't had much problems with constipation because I have been using kratom exclusively for the last 5 months. The main problem now was I was noticing blood in my stool more than half the time I would shit. No real constipation though. At this point I'd gotten used to the blood and would clean myself in the shower if I ever saw it. It still makes me sick but idk what to do.

Anyways, here's where the real story starts: for the last month and a half I've been using suboxone every day, I replaced kratom with subs. Usually 2-4mg a day.

I didn't really realize it, but as the weeks went by I didn't shit. And I was eating a normal amount + days with big meals.

By the 4th week I'd realized I hadn't taken a real shit in a while, just pebbles like 4 times in the last 4 weeks. I also noticed I would sometimes need to push a little bit to pee.

Then I tried to poop, and it wouldn't come out. It was stuck.

So I started drinking magnesium citrate and was able to get a small, dense one out.

A couple days pass and I try again. This time it hurts and is completely stuck. I start to worry and realize how fucked I am. That was 8 days ago, and I realized then that there would be eventual retribution, that I had to pay the price.

As well, 8 days ago I ran out of subs and used kratom the entire week. Yesterday I got more subs and have been using them since. The week of just kratom got my bowels moving more.

So that day I started the kratom I bought solid and liquid glycerin suppositorys, more magnesium citrate, and miralax. That night I put in the solid glycerin one and kept it in for two days before I had to go. When I tried to poop, it was a solid conglomerate of smaller dense pebbled. It wasn't shaped right to come out so I shot some of the liquid glycerin to help get it out. It burned like a bitch. After 10 minuted I peed glycerin out if my ass, and then was able to shit. The glycerin had broken the conglomerate into chunks. That was about 6 days ago.

If you'd total all of my shit since starting bup, it would have been worth 2-4 nornal shits, except possibly much denser.

-------------**TL;DR**---------------------

So yesterday I wake up in WD with the strong urge to shit, but I had to go get my subs so I put the shitting off. I got and dosed half a strip of subs and just held in the shit cus I could tell it was gonna be painful.

Later that day, when the urge got too strong, I tried to shit. It would just barely come out and got stuck, which was extremely painful. I realized this wasn't gonna come out without tearing my ass, unless I did something. It was just so dense, hard, and dry. As well, what I didn't realize was that this shit was mishapen. It was a conglomerate of mid sized pebbles that was shaped extremely weird, it had a cavitation in the middle, like a cup, that was pointing out of my ass, and it had sides that were too long 

So I made the really hard choice and *sucked it back into my asshole*. I aborted mission. It hurt so bad doing that but I was honestly too scared to continue trying, and wasn't eager to test whether my asshole or the shit was stronger. I also noticed my stomach looked distended, fat, even though I'm extremely skinny and have almost no body fat.

I made a plan: I'd give myself a liquid glycerin suppository + the same amount of water up my ass, and retain it/hold it in there until tomorrow, to give it time to soften the shit up and hopefully it'd break apart. 

So later that night at 11, after eating an entire small thin crust papa johns pizza, I decided I'd do it now.

I covered the tip of the liquid suppository syringe with petroleum jelly/vaseline, and shot glycerin up there. Then I refilled it with water and shot water uo there. Then another bulb full of water. Then I washed my hands and laid down in bed, I didn't really get an urges to shit.

Until 3 hours later, when I got an extremely strong urge to go. I raced to the bathroom and shit out pure liquid shit. So dark I couldn't see through it but pure liquid. No solids. I could tell I didn't get anything substantial out. I could tell because the same solid shit as before was trying to get out but like before it couldn't get out, and hurt so bad. I sucked it back in after all the liquid was evacuated.

So I drank a spoonfull of miralax + like 3 doses of magnesium citrate and a lot of water. Then an idea: maybe I could also use one of the solid suppositorys overnight. See, at this point I was terrified of what was gonna happen. Opiates make me scared of shitting because of how painful it can be.

So I applied more vaseline to my butthole and shoved a solid glycerin suppository in there until it was deep in. It kinda hurt. Not because of the burn or anything, I didn't feel that. But because at the end of the suppository, facing out of my ass, was a cup. 

It's hard to describe over writing but it basically has a shelf at the bottom, like a cup. The edges extend but it's hollow. And the edges felt sharp and was rubbing against my colon. I tried getting it out but the vaseline formed a vacuum and the more I tried to get it out the more the edges of the end rubbed and hurt my rectum.

A good analogy would be that it felt like a lego brick was stuck in my asshole.

Then I wondered whether these things actually dissolve. I put a new solid suppository in my sink and ran hot water over it for a while. Nothing happened, it looked exactly the same. Btw, it was the exact same the next morning. What the fuck is even the point of these things if they don't dissolve.

So now I basically had a solid buttplug in that wasn't gonna dissolve. And it hurt, any movement I made it hurt.

So I just tried to pretend nothing was wrong and go to sleep. I took some melatonin and layed down and tried to ignore the fact that any time I made the slightest movement my asshole would hurt. 

After about an hour or two of this, I had the urge to piss (from all the water I drank for the magnesium and miralax). And I had to shit. Urgently.

-------------**SHIT-TIME**----------------

So I stumbled to the bathroom, walking funny to avoid my ass hurting from the glycerin butt plug, and tried to piss. But nothing was coming out. And when I tried to push, I could feel shit being pushed out. Not wanting to diarrhea all over my pants and underwear, I sat on the toilet. But it wasn't enough... So I took off my pants/underwear and squated on the ground. Here's where it gets fun.

I still wasn't able to pee, but immediately a bunch more liquid comes out of my ass and all over the bathroom floor. Same stuff as before, dark liquid shit. I said fuck it and took off my shirt and reached my hand to my ass. I had pushed enough and was able to easily retrieve the solid suppository, which was still completely solid and the exact same as before. I threw it away in the toilet. 

I decided that since I'd already got the suppository out I might as well try to manipulate the shit in me and maybe try to get it to come out. I felt around the shit and realized that it was almost hooking over my ass from the inside. Some of it was out, some of it was inside but too far sideways thus my ass couldn't handle the width, and because of how dense it was it wasn't breaking. I started manually pushing and breaking. And what's funny was that I wasn't actually even able to break it, that's how strong it was, I couldn't break it with my hands. I pushed it in, pulled, pushed my taint, etc, just messing around with it. And the entire time this was happening I was in massive pain. 

I then decided to quit and stood up. And then I felt a shift. I jumped in the shower and started pushing and it rapidly started coming out more then it had before. It got stuck again so I grabbed it, this time it was actually starting to come out. This entire time I was repeating the word fuck and god no and was in massive pain. When it got stuck again I actually tried to suck it back in because of how much pain I was in but it was already too far out, which I realized when I touched it. I pulled it with my hand and clenched my ass to hopefully break it between my glorius sphincter, and I started feeling the familiar feeling of your ass releasing and closing around shit as it lets go. Suddenly it was free, and suddenly I was holding a piece of shit like a goddamn monkey. The release felt amazing. And don't forget, the entire time I was standing up.

I held it. It was a monster, a ball the size of a small orange and the density of a neutron star. I sighed in relief...

**But wait, there's more!**

I suddenly realized I had more. I dropped the shit in my hand on the shower tiles. At first I thought all of the pain and  urgency I'd been experiencing all day was from the shit I had just shit, and I fully expected the next load to just be small comfortable pieces that had simply been blocked. Because of this mistaken belief, I pushed hard. Within 15 seconds it was already getting pretty far out of my ass and I realized the mistake I had made. This was the true monster. The uncomfortableness and pain of it merged in my mind and honestly it hurt so bad I became dissociated, which almost numbed the pain. The second this happened I just started repeating ""Oh my god, it's so big, please no, I can't believe this is happening, how is this even possible it's too big"" over and over again. Once it was out halfway I felt it and pulled a little bit and this finished it off. The feeling of my asshole and rectum slipping over the end of it and retracting was both extremely uncomfortable, painful, and almost welcoming because it meant I wasn't prolapsing and that it was over. That last second as my ass finally retracted on itself and fully expelled the shit was glorious. The last half of it exiting felt like a crescendo, almost spiritual, 100% an altered state, the last 20 seconds of it exiting had this energy that built up until it exploded right at the end. Like the opposite of an orgasm and extremely painful and completely non-sexual. In retrospect it came out in a very healthy way, it's like after the initial blockage was released my body was super eager to get the stuff behind it out and orchestrated the effort perfectly.

It exited my ass and fell right into my hand, and as it did I could already tell it was heavy. I moved my hand to my front and examined the shit in disbelief. It was, by far and without a doubt, the widest shit I have ever shit. I honestly couldn't believe it. It was fucking huge. It was about a fist and a half wide and 8 inchs long. This will sound absolutely ridiculous, but I almost felt proud, and I definitely felt relieved, standing there in the shower naked, holding shit. 

I dropped the monster on the tiles and stood there in disbelief for a minute or two, basking in the feeling of absolute relief. My asshole felt honestly kinda good because it was finally completely relaxed, the entire day it had been puckering constantly in order to hold all the shit in but now it could just be free. I checked my stomach in the mirror and it looked completely normal. I then realized I still had to pee and tried to and peed normally there in the shower which was amazing because the pressure that had been blocking my urinary tract was now gone.

After another minute or two of disbelief and joy I began cleaning up. Threw the shit in the toilet (which it immediately clogged), cleaned the floor, and then turned on the shower and took a very long, cleansing shower. Washed the shower tiles, washed my body completely, washed my ahole out. After I got out of the shower I took a big glob of petroleum jelly and rubbed the outside and a little bit of the inside of my butthole with it. Surprisingly I didn't see any blood during this whole ordeal whatsoever which is funny considering how big it was compared to nornal ones, but I still applied vaseline just incase.

After spraying bleach cleaner fucking everywhere in the bathroom and getting dressed with new clothes I fell into bed in utter spiritual relief and browsed on my phone before falling asleep.

If I had known how everything would turn out, and if I had known how it would have felt, I probably would've tried to have avoided it all costs and just hold it in. But now that it's over and I got that shit out, I feel so much better, and am glad it happened. I think constipation where you have lots of shit built up is extremely unhealthy and I'm glad I've gotten a mini-reset. Even though I took a ton of miralax and magnesium citrate yesterday I haven't had any urge whatsoever to shit today, not even a tiny one, and no gas. I know that I'll be taking magnesium citrate and miralax every day from now on to make sure a blockage like that never developes again. I've learned my lesson.

What I think happened was the multiple doses of magnesium citrate and miralax I had been taking ended up rehydrating and fusing multiple logs of shit into one, like a shit mutant hybrid. The initial blockage had been preventing these logs their exit and when I soaked them with laxatives they all fused into one.

Anyways, I hope you guys found that enjoyable/entertaining or relatable. I might delete this because of how disgusting it is but I'm interested in hearing some responses or others people's stories. Cheers.",1544571199.0

&#x200B;

I feel I need to start with a bit of a back story, so here it goes. I first used codeine around 5 years ago by using the CWE method with a friend. I really enjoyed it and always wanted to try it again. Around 8 months ago, I found a reliable source for pure (no APAP) pharmaceutical codeine tablets 30mg. I took around 5 of these tablets every Saturday as a treat and quickly remembered how amazing the stuff makes you feel with no tolerance! Once these had ran out I decided to try dihydrocodeine (again, no APAP) just pure 30mg tablets. Dihydrocodeine is said to be around 1.5x stronger than codeine, but I feel the strength of the high is the same, just different. Dihydrocodeine feels a lot more ""speedy"" and seems to last a lot longer (up to 8 hours) in my opinion.

Before long I was using the dihydrocodeine at work on quiet days, but to my amazement I actually worked a lot better on it! Boring tasks suddenly felt fun, I was no longer getting fatigued or craving junk food, all my anxieties of talking to customers had suddenly disappeared. I simply felt amazing!

I continued to use every other day, until one weekend I went to stay at a friends house, leaving my dihydrocodeine at home. The second day I woke up with awful diarrhea and felt terribly anxiety, I assumed I had eaten something bad the day before and had a touch of food poisoning. The next day came and I felt worse, I had everything from the second day but with added chills and incredible aches in my muscles, at that point it dawned on me, I was in withdrawal. I got home that night and started researching about it, how long it would last ect. and decided to stick it out, for the next few days the diarrhea subsided but the chills/aches continued, but I powered on using non-opiate pain killers and small amounts of phenibut and alcohol in the evenings to help me through it.

Around 7 days from the start, I finally felt normal again.

About a month ago I decided to start using again a few days a week, and of course, I've slipped back into daily use. I am going through a stressful and unique period in my life, I am busy at work as well as studying for a qualification that wont finish until the middle of next year and the dihydrocodeine helps me so much! SO my question is...can I keep using dihydrocodeine to help me through this period? I am currently using about 120-180mg per day and my tolerance doesn't seem to have increased that much. I have two very reliable sources so its unlikely I will run out it suddenly, and even if I did I always make sure to have a least 30 tablets in reserve just in case I need them to taper off.  I also have no way of getting stronger opiates even if I wanted to, so I'm not going to jump up a level.

What do you all think? Can I carry on using for now and taper off in a couple of months? Or am I harming myself in some way and should quit as soon as possible?

Thanks for reading all that and for any replies!

&#x200B;

\*EDIT\*

I suppose what I'm asking is if I continue using will I be able to quit with similar ease as last time or am I missing something? Also am I causing any damage to myself? From what I can tell opiates are generally safe for your liver/kidneys/heart and the only problem is the constipation and addiction, is this right?",1544567076.0

I'm on a 0.6 a day of fire stuff and the same stuff consistently for the past 3 months, I was on 2gs a day but eventually lowered down because of better quality stuff, I'm planning on just smoking when I need to smoke and slowly wean myself off it to avoid any mental physical symptoms (obviously I know there will still be some but trying to eliminate it as much as possible) I am only going to be smoking 0.2 per day as of tomorrow 0.1 in the morning and 0.1 at night, the stuff I'm getting holds me for 10 hours and have a constant supply of it when I need it,

I tried suboxone but I can't do that treatment right now because I need to be off this stuff within 3 months because I'm moving away for 2 years and need to get off it before I go. Do you think I could do this within 3 months??

So I am extremely determined and plan on getting a timed lock box for my stuff so I don't over indulge.

I also have a friend who is doing the same as me so we are going to support each other all the way through.

This equals about $1000/week and $52000(!)/year, which is absolutely insane to me because I‚Äôm really not even getting THAT high. 

So I always hear about how everyone switches from pills to dope because they are too expensive. My question is, at this level of use how much would you end up spending per week by switching to dope. Also secondly, how fast does your tolerance build from this point. With pills it feels like I gotta up the dose every mf day if I‚Äôm actually trying to nod out. Like I‚Äôm curious how much people end up spending when hooked on H. 

*I want to put a disclaimer saying that I have absolutely no plans of switching and even if I wanted to, I have no plugs or leads to make that happen. The reason I even ran up my tolerance like this is because I used to have an insane rx plug that I would trade with for other drugs.

I don't mind being a functional addict, but I'm not willing to live a junkie's life so no cold copping & being on the brink of disaster & w/d for me.

* 56% mitragynine
* 15% paynantheine
* 11% speciogynine
* 16% Speciociliatine

by weight, which is pretty effective.

Had I started this from a position of strength I would have gotten a big supply of a synthetic opioid with nice long legs & tried to minimize my tolerance with ultra low doses of naltrexone.

Unfortunately those are all gone as far as I know & I couldn't get them if they were.

So what are my options?  I have health insurance, but even a medically assisted detox will leave me at best in the same situation I was before this started.

It's ironic that the state couldn't be arsed to get involved during my decade of childhood physical & emotional abuse, neglect, alienation from all friends, families or allies while being raised by a woman with a personality disorder. That fucked up my brain chemistry pretty well,

But as an adult tax payer who never hurt anyone, once I start to tweak it back the state needs to intervene.

 Would you do that if you could? Only pay for 15% of your drugs and launder the rest of what you‚Äôd be giving a drug dealer? I guess the obvious answer is yes, I just found this fascinating and I totally believe it too. Not sure if I could launder shit tho haha

Right away I knew it was off in weight but I didn't have my scale with me (I won't drive with a scale since that is considered to be paraphernalia i.e. felony charge) so I headed home at a crawl so I could weigh it and get confirmation on what I already believed was a purposefully planted, total mental mind fuck. I kept going back and forth in my head... ""This isn't off by that much, I'm just blowing this out of proportion in my head!"" To ""Holy shit, he totally fucking gave me a shitload of dope! He had to have done it on purpose to see if I'd be honest and let him know about the mistake quick enough to prove that I'm a loyal customer?"" Which one is it? What am I!? A loyal adict or a thief? Of course I'm freaking out more and more as the moments pass. It takes about 30 minutes to get home after scoring, so every second that passes that I don't call him and explain the situation to make it right, is a possible strike against me and a possible lost connect. But I couldn't even fathom calling without getting the confirmation in my head on what was exactly given to me. Mistake or not. So I drove home in a sweat, continuously palming and squeezing the huge chunks in my hands trying to guess the amount of dope I had been given and running through the various scenarios that could have possibly transpired. As more and more time passes, I'm also trying to determine if I should even say anything. If he had realized his mistake then I surely would have received a call by now. 5 minutes turn to 10 and I'm just shaking and sifting through the different options. Can I just pretend I got the right amount? Would he be able to tell or figure out who was given the wrong amount? How many people did he sell to tonight? How many people does he have running for him? Was the guy himself reliable? Does he have a habit and he's just totally out of it right now and doesn't know what he's doing? I could just pretend that I got my normal amount.. I'd have saved over $4000 worth of dope by just keeping my mouth shut. Holy crap that's a shit load of money I could save.
I finally get home and weigh it and it says 60gs. My frantically beating heart drops into my stomach and I realize I've got to be honest and call my dboy to explain what happened or I could risk a shit storm I'm not prepared for. He didn't even fucking realize he had given me the wrong amount. Jesus. He asks me to drive to meet him to return the extra dope and promptly hangs up. I'm sitting there pissed off and then I immediately get a call back. ""Go ahead and take 4g's for yourself. Thanks!""

Wow.. Thanks? Gotta change my soiled shorts and I'll be right there.

Friends who are mainly interested in getting free drugs...off me. ...,"\*Disclaimer\*AP OLOGIES for the excessive verbosity that ensues:         I have a friend(s), and yes they are good people, caring etc, but I notice they are *very, very* attentive to our friendship when they know that I have drugs on hand. ie. when they know they will get free bumps of oxy or percs. I don't mind giving them a bump here and there, but as we know the cost of pills adds up, particularly when you make $10 an hour, even though I do get a great deal$ on them, still expensive when you have the tolerance of a lab monkey (sorry PETA).

   They, as a couple def pull more money than me, but they cringe at the possibility of spending $7-$10 on a pill (for 20 mg), as I have offered to purchase pills for them or sell them a few of mine. When I have them they suddenly want to get together, phone calls are more frequent etc.

Granted, I am much much more social on them as well, and they are the only people that would be cool with it...so it is nice having the company at times but I do laugh to myself. Also, if the shoes were reversed I would be the same way, but at least I would pay for them. I am not angry or resentful but I recently gained clarity of the situation and it kind of makes me laugh as they are not subtle. 

   They seem to be aggravated (would never admit) when I have told them I can't afford to share with them all the time. They are friends beyond the drugs it is just funny how it changes the dynamics of SO MANY relationships.

   I'm sure I am not the only person who has experienced this, I would like to hear what other people have seen when they have drugs, like all of a sudden that chick you didn't have a chance with starts hitting on you ETC etc etc. It really is funny",1544480133.0

Now, I have a friend who sells it. Has been asking if I want any, I might.

Idk if I‚Äôm even gonna get any. Opiates aren‚Äôt my thing but the H high did feel nice once the nausea went away haha... I‚Äôm just curious about these prices honestly. Seem weird to me, almost like coke prices.

With Dopiny Blastit (lol I really tried there , do better plz) kinda bitch shit post 0_o","Welp. The last few days have proven to be a royal fuck fest. Let me start off by saying I moved to a new town to be closer to family and I know no one. There are about 1000 ppl total , no visible homeless I can see , no clinic and no fucking hope. So in hopes of being prepared, I decided I'd just save a little money each day until I had enough to grab a ball that could last me a few weeks hopefully until I'd have to make another trip , make an order , set up delivery , or just whatever would work . Dope is super fuckin expensive where I'm from , but you can travel in any direction about 90 miles and cut your cost.  I arranged with my plug last week that I'd give him a ride to pick up and he would hook me on a ball at cost.  Great , yup , everything is seeming wonderfully planned right ? 

So a couple days ago I'm getting my stuff ready and a buddy stops by to score some clean darts . The good Samaritan that I am obliges. He stops by with a few friends , i run to grab a bag, come back and they're all gone.  Weird . Hour later I'm calling plug to get set up ,  all good . Go to get my ducks aka money in a row and my savings is gone.  You can guess what happened . Yes my dumbass left my loot in a semi open place , being my dresser drawer. Don't know if someone saw me put it there or what but clearly they knew what they were after.  With friends like these right man? 

Well fuck right.  While I'm freaking out about the bread being gone; the plug gets impatient , grabs another lift and bolts without me. Great, I've got a little cash left not close to what I saved but could keep me straight a few days.  Meanwhile plug decides they're staying overnight and I gotta get outta town.  Buy local I decide. Go thru my like #3-4 plug who answers first and is within reason on prices. Go to grab, make exchange , drive off, open up , taste .... And it's a mix of what I think is crushed cookies and meth.  Great.  Go to call/text dude , has me blocked. Well that validates the fact he duffed me. Now I'm pretty much broke at this point right ? Hit up a slew of ppl that owe me money , come up with something at least . (All this while I'm way late getting to my new place) Onto plug #2 , never failed me.  Grab an hg of some ""new stuff"".  Open the bindle check it out first : looks good , tastes ok like pretty bad.  K get it home set my rig up , do less then normal dose to be safe . Nothing. Do a little more. Nothing.  Ok well I can't do the whole hg possibly and not feel anything.  Fuck, yup sure did.  Hit up plug 2, he can't believe it.  Acting like I'm trying to cop free shit but says he'll make it right when he gets back .... In a week. Great.  

I'm outta funds , outta options , don't get paid til next week now . I've literally been asking the homies and fam for like 20 bucks at least to get me thru my first day unpacking and getting settled.  Family is tense, just lost someone to suicide.  Lost both grandparents the last few months. Dad's getting worse in dementia. Mom's killing herself drinking vodka from dusk til dawn. 


I'm just throwing my hands up like , what's next man? I'm starting WD, dude that could front is outta town , I'm supposed to leave like yesterday. Ill be sick soon and I'm feeling pretty screwed  I tried to plan everything to avoid this kinda thing . Saved my loot like a responsible drug addict lol and here I sit , robbed and duffed. I can't even describe how I feel , like numb but defeated , angry but emotionally dead. Feel free to validate my ridiculously long antedote regarding my own stupid misfortune. Probably that could have been avoided , but alas I can't go back and now I'm broke and screwed.

All I can discern from Glassdoor is that it's an ""extensive"" urine test.  I do know that if I get the conditional offer, I can't exactly ask them for 5 days before taking the test without raising suspicion.  If I get an offer on Wednesday, I'd assume I need to test on Friday. I also know they use a chain like Quest or something, so I don't think I'd be observed.

I take 70 mg of Vicodin per day and have for a long time.  I'm female, 140 pounds.

I took Vicodin last at 9 p.m. Sunday.  I was thinking of taking kratom for a few days to help with WD, but I don't know if this test will include that, so I'd have to stop that in a day or two.

Or, I could get synthetic urine.  I do not have anyone I can ask for clean urine.  I looked at the drug test links on here, and it looks like there are some good options.

Has anyone done an extensive test and passed with synthetic?  I'm thinking like DOT test.

This is all sidestepping my philosophical objection to a job that tests for a desk jockey position, but that's my own issue.  Right now I'm temping and I need permanent to get insurance to get in pain management.

TLDR: Drug test in 4-5 days.  Kick Vicodin and pray, or go synthetic?

Leaving my trash laying around or accidentally dropping a empty has got me fucked up with the police, girl friends and family, so now to avoid any slip-ups I chew them up beyond recognition and spit them out the window, flush them down the toilet or just throw them in the trash. Well not any more.
   About a hour ago I was getting ready to crash and rationing out my dope for the next couple days. I figured tomorrow I will be at work so to make things easier I will just put 4 bags into one. My thought was that I would walk around the corner and use my little straw cut at a 45 to scoop up a nice bump and get right back to work before anyone noticed anything. These bags I am getting at the moment are super fat and after I combined the 4 I had a monster bag that looked amazing. After i flicked it to the bottom and compacted it, it was well past the first fold, if I had to guess I'd say it was between .5g and .6g. 
   After I finished my handiwork I went to my stash and grabbed another bag to do before relaxing and going to bed. I do, and when I finished I throw the stamp into the little pile of empties... which is right next to the monster bag. In one motion, not thinking, I sweep up *all* the bags on my dresser and chew them up for a minute and throw them in the trash. Feeling pretty good, I go outside for a smoke, though my joy is short lived. On my way to bed I glance at my dresser and to my horror my ration for tomorrow is no where to be found. That's when it hit me, i fucking chewed it up along with the trash. 
   These bags are a lot stronger then ones i usually get, my first though was that I just killed myself. If I were to snort 4 of these I would be pushing daisies for sure. Just one gets me well if I am sick and I nod pretty heavily after 2. Thankfully I just ruined my dope and didn't consume all of it, those little glassine bags are pretty tough. My next thought was that I am a fucking idiot, now I am 4 bags short and am going to be be sick sooner then anticipated. FML, I am praying that JJ makes something happen by the end of the week.

Meth and Heroin.  I tried this for the first time the other day, like 3 days ago now. I'm not one much for speedballing (or whatever you call it If its with meth)  for several reasons, normal amphetamines completely mask the opiate high and I dont feel them, just the stim. If I'm doing the traditional eith coke, it's like the effects of both drugs come in waves, one minute I feel the warmth of the dope, and the next I'm feeling my heart pounding and shit, and that's not too comfortable. BUT HOLY FUCKING SHIT, METH AND HEROIN. Like my eyes were pinned as fuck and i was about to nod, and then my boy put the bubble in front of me and was like ""this shit is that fire, straight jet fuel, just hit it"" (this stuff was like strsight shards, no powder, and was almost completely transparent, crushed into fine white powder, and cracked back like instantly... I dont do meth a whole lot. But I know enough meth heads, to know what good meth should be like, at least I think) so I'm like, ok, let's do it, whatever, blow some meth clouds, and like two fucking big ass clouds in, i was FUCKING LIT. Like its really hard to describe how I felt, but it was amazing. I was hitting fire meth, but my pupils were still pinned as fuck, and like fuck, I wish I had more vocabulary to be able to describe how good it felt. Like so good.... and that's the scary part. Even good meth is garbage for you, and like its so fucking cheap. I'm really kinda wishing I hadn't tried this combo, because now it's like, ""yeah, let's do that again ""

I got extreme hard veins to hit since I am born. And I am very scarred of needles which I am a bit more ok with now. I tried IV about 10 times and only hit a vein 3 times. Even nurses and doctors have it very hard to hit them. I once had a trainee nurse who hit me 20 times untill the doc said he will do it and he also needed 5 tries. I was child back then and since then I am scared of needles but I am ok with that now. I tried IV now 10 times and only hit 3 times ,2 times only a bit intothe vein the rest was missed. And once all in my veins and holy shit loved I the rush. Man its not describal. Anyways since I dont know any otger junkies whom could give me any advives I ghought I will ask here. And yes I know there is the sidebar post but I got veins which are called durectly translated running veins. As soon the needle goes through the skin the vein will roll tonthe left or right side. So this makes it much Harder too. Amd I can only hit in the hands and feets and now in the winter into the crrok of my elbowsLArms too since J only wear pullis, seater and jackets so no on one wil see my upper arms. Since everyone thinks I am clean right now ans I want that it stays that way maybe someone can help me out. I mean from that great stuff I even go to  nodcity by sniffing it and not too much but I boofed it on saturday and the rush was so extremly strong that Inat least want to know how IV feels with this dope. So please any input will help me. Thanks in advance fam. stay safe and happy nods. Love this sub ans all of you.

I thought I'd stay that way for the rest of high school, go to college, get a job, get married, have kids, and just be a happy & successful person. Literally one year later, I started getting depressed over failed relationships with girls and turned to alcohol & xanax. I eventually found the girl who I thought was the solution to my depression halfway through my Junior year, but she just turned out to be the worst one of the bunch. I thought I'd get clean for her, and jump back onto my train to success. Nope. Not even two weeks into knowing her, she was clearly problematic, and I decided to keep using, eventually moving onto cocaine. Her and I were on and off all of 2018 up until the beginning of our Senior year. I have now dropped out of school and I am addicted to heroin. Heroin is the only drug that felt like an actual solution to my depression. I started fucking with this girl who got me into heroin, and I thought I was over the previous girl. A couple of days ago my family and friends have caught onto the fact that I am using heroin. I didn't know what to do, so I cut off the heroin girl and started detoxing at home. I genuinely thought I was over my previous girlfriend up until the point that I stopped using. Out of no where, she started haunting my thoughts again. I miss her. She was my everything. I don't know which I love more, heroin or Paige. While laying in bed, wanting to cut my legs off, I can't help but reminisce about the good times with Paige. Why did she have to leave me? Why couldn't we work it out? I won her back towards the end of July 2018, I thought I had it all figured out, I was 2 weeks clean off of all substances, now I'm a high school drop out junkie loser heroin user. I didn't realize that I was using heroin to numb the pain of the break up. Why am I like this? I threw so many opportunities out the window in the name of love for this girl. This girl who used me as a doormat. And now that my eyes are open to the existence of heroin, I feel like I just dug a deeper hole and I'll never overcome this.

She forged a letter stating I wanted my name removed from our lease, so I was forced out by the police. She took both of my dogs. She told my friends and family I emotionally abused her. I still love her and refuse to make her look like a bad person, so I apologized for my non-existent abusive actions. 

&#x200B;

A week after she left me, they found 3 tumors running down the middle of my brain. The tumors are noncancerous, but inoperable and growing. They also diagnosed me with multiple sclerosis.

&#x200B;

Yesterday after a month of planning, she was going to allow me to take the dogs to the park. I waited 6 hours at the park, she texted me saying she changed plans. She also told me she should've left me a long time ago and she stopped loving me about 7 months ago. 

&#x200B;

I accidentally texted her, ""call me."" so she blocked my number. I love someone who hates me, has destroyed my image, taken everything I love from me. I am slowly losing my health, my brain is slowly being pushed up against my skull.

I spend $150 a day snorting Heroin, I am 20 years old. Thing is, I've lost my job due to my health and expect to run out of money in about 6 weeks. I will use the last of my money to buy a gun, and end my life.

The hop has me nodded hard.

Most of the afternoon, I guess, and when I wake up there‚Äôs a kink in my neck. A bad one. It is something I have had to deal with ever since I got a bad chiropractic adjustment. Not by a chiropractor though, and in retrospect, I should have known not to trust the guy as he‚Äôd ripped me off for a hundred dollars just a few weeks before when he sold me a half empty bottle of eyedrops as LSD. Anyway, my neck has had problems since, and the kid is standing over me pulling on my sleeve and asking for a cigarette. It‚Äôs annoying, but I pull the pack out of my pocket and toss it onto the coffee table. He grabs one out and lights it up. There‚Äôs more daylight out than I expected to see.

‚ÄúHey. What do you think about this?‚Äù

The kid poses in the Captain Morgan stance. His foot rests on the coffee table. The cigarette hangs from his lips and his face is ratcheted to the side like Popeye the Sailor man. He rolls up the leg of his jeans revealing what older generations might call a carbuncle, unsightly and excruciating in its appearance. It is the size of a tangerine and marbled in sickly swirls of infected yellow and a gangrenous purplish black interrupted by pockets of angry red bleeding.

‚ÄúI think you need to go the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Doesn‚Äôt it hurt?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you think?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Looks painful as hell.‚Äù I say.

‚ÄúIt is. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stayed away. I don‚Äôt need some idiot in a white coat stabbing at it and pressing on it and all that crap.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. But you need antibiotics, bro. Otherwise, you might be some idiot with his leg cut off or dead or worse. I promise. I‚Äôll go with you. There‚Äôs a doc in the box not too far from here.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? You don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll just absorb back into my body and go away?‚Äù He says ‚Äòegg zorb‚Äô instead of absorb.

‚ÄúYeah. Really. Let‚Äôs go, after we get out and get the medicine, though, I want you to take me to meet your sister in law or whatever she is. The stripper who buys a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, dude, whatever you want.‚Äù

35

The girl at the front desk requires 400 dollars before she‚Äôll schedule us in.

I pay. It‚Äôs not much to me at this point, but the kid is sitting in the waiting room trying to make the remote work and having this half-hearted conversation with a bald guy about the Mariners. I sit across from them and the bald guy starts trying to tell jokes. The jokes aren‚Äôt funny.

It‚Äôs a problem Seattle has seemed to have ever since my dad died. People‚Äôs senses of humor just aren‚Äôt that good, and even though, I can‚Äôt honestly say I remember them ever being better than they are now, it really does seem like Seattle got less funny when my dad left us. Everyone in Seattle is always laughing at their own jokes. Whatever, though. It‚Äôs just how it is anymore. Makes me miss my dad today listening to this guy try to tell me a joke.

The kid is not paying attention to any of it, though. He‚Äôs just moving that remote through the air and now he‚Äôs standing on the chair. The remote‚Äôs still not working.

‚ÄúHere. Let me try.‚Äù I say. The waiting room is small and to my left another man sits with his lower lip hanging off his face like a piece of busted rubber or something. Every bit of his gums and teeth is exposed. A strand of drool hangs from his mouth and drips onto his shirt, and the man is breathing hard. I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs farted or if it‚Äôs just his breath that stinks so bad.

The bald man has been called back. He limps away. I get the remote and make it work on my first try. The kid throws his hands up.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWisdom comes with age, my friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, whatever. Let me try again.‚Äù

He snatches the remote from me and tries. It still doesn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúCharlie, bro. You know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should. We went to the same NA meeting for a year or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue. Guess I was in my own world. Thanks, though, for inviting me to that game.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem. Say you think I‚Äôm gonna be okay?‚Äù There is a genuine fear in his eyes.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lose my leg.‚Äù

A fat nurse steps out into the lobby. She holds a clipboard and stares at it. ‚ÄúCharles Pulaski!‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù He stands up and turns back to me. ‚ÄúYou coming?‚Äù

I stand up and walk with him to the exam room. It is cold and bathed in sterile white light. Scents of bleach and other astringent cleaners float in the air. He sits on the table, and after a minute, the doctor comes in.

The doctor is nice enough. He makes appropriate small talk and doesn‚Äôt sneer in disgust at the sight of the abscess on the kid‚Äôs leg but instead shows compassion and orders a shot of lidocaine and ten milligrams of diazepam for him. The doctor lances and drains the infection and walks out. Charlie cries in pain until he sleeps a moment on the table. After the nurse comes back with a prescription for amoxicillin, we walk out. The daylight drifts into night. I take him to fill it and back to my apartment where I hook him up with another shot to sleep it off. He calls his sister in law and sets up an appointment for me. I leave him sleeping on the couch.

36

I walk a while in the night and drizzle.

And eventually catch a bus that should get me close to the club where the girl works. Public transit is something I avoid anymore. It‚Äôs so slow. There‚Äôs no reason for me to, anyway. A 40-dollar cab ride or whatever it would be isn‚Äôt much for me these days. I‚Äôve got rubber banded rolls of cash, so much that I don‚Äôt even know how much I actually have. Counting it is a chore at this point. So, I just keep it in a few shoeboxes in the crawl space in my hallway and limit counting it to times that I am going to reup or pay something or someone‚Äôs giving me a bundle for the dope I sell them. You have to count it sometimes. Other than that though, I carry a couple thousand or so in my pocket. It‚Äôs enough for what I need and everything I don‚Äôt.

On the bus a dark old man with black boogers matted into the hairs hanging from his nose and rancid malt liquor on his breath wraps his arm around me and pushes his nose into my neck and face and babbles warm words. His breath and brain are wet with liquor, and brown tobacco spit dribbles into his beard. It tickles and stinks. I laugh. He tells me that he‚Äôs from Cambodia, but other than that, he makes no sense. Maybe, he‚Äôs speaking Cambodian, but it sounds like gibberish. I want to be kind, but the smell is too much for me, so I push him off to move up a seat and turn around to hand him a twenty.

The scene reminds me of this stupid story I made up, once, about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out very bad and unsolicited advice to everyone he meets, which is literally the most ridiculous and terrible storyline I could dream up. Most of my stories are that. Extremely bad jokes. Life is like a bad joke, and I get to thinking about the twenty bucks I just gave the Cambodian guy and how it won‚Äôt help him. Like Charlie. I gave him what he wanted. Heroin won‚Äôt actually help him, though. Not in the long run. There are others hurt by it. Beth comes to mind and the last time I saw her with Sal. He‚Äôd been beating her. She overdosed the next day at Tony‚Äôs place.

I think about her daughter. I think about myself, and it hurts. There is such turmoil in my chest, a pair of rats gnawing at a cage made of wire. I call Beth and look out the window. It rings. Maybe if I could transport myself in time and space to a graveyard on a hill over looking Los Angeles in the searing August heat of 1991, maybe that would fix it somehow. Although, I can‚Äôt figure out how it would, and I don‚Äôt know where in the hell a thought like that comes from. It feels right, though. It feels like it would make things better. That, or a lobotomy. Before, I can think much of my frontal lobe being snipped and scrambled or long needled syringes full of silicone going in behind the eyeball, the line rings again and Beth picks up.

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Her voice bends in its despair.

‚ÄúSup? How‚Äôre ya doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúMmmm‚Ä¶ you know. What about you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess business‚Äôs good for you. Haven‚Äôt seen ya in a few weeks.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorge found out what was going on. My mom and sister came and took my daughter from me, but it‚Äôs for the best. It just sucks.‚Äù Her voice breaks.

‚ÄúProbably. I haven‚Äôt seen you with Sal.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get me started. It‚Äôs been bad, Randy. Real bad. I‚Äôm starting the suboxone program tomorrow.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Good.‚Äù I hang on the line and don‚Äôt say anything.

She says, ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,‚Äù looking for me to end the conversation or tell her I‚Äôm coming over or something.

‚ÄúBeth?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, Randy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. You know? I never meant for all of this to happen. It just sorta did.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. I‚Äôm grown up. I made my decisions. Not you. So keep it to yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWish it made me feel better.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù She stays quite a moment. ‚ÄúMe too, Randy. If I could just wake up from this. You know?‚Äù Sounds like tears are in her eyes.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôll talk to you soon. Call me if you need anything. Really, Beth. Anything. I can help.‚Äù

Calling her hasn‚Äôt made me feel any better. She wouldn‚Äôt even let me apologize, but it‚Äôs hard to see how it would have fixed anything anyhow. The sadness dissipates by the time I get off the bus and walk the last few blocks up to the strip club. I call the kid‚Äôs ex-sister-in-law. She tells me to meet her behind the club and is standing next to the dumpster when I make the corner. She says,

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre the guy?‚Äù I hear her say it in person and over the phone.

I talk back into the phone and directly to her. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

We both laugh. She puts her phone into the side pocket of her coat and says,

‚ÄúMy car‚Äôs parked down the block. Walk with me.‚Äù She takes off down the sidewalk. Her stilettos click on the cement. Whatever perfume she‚Äôs wearing wafts back to me as I follow and parked out front of a dirty white house is a small Dodge Neon. We both get in. I sit shotgun. She sits behind the wheel.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got 150 bucks.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright. Well usually I sell grams for 100‚Ä¶,‚Äù and before I can tell her that I‚Äôll give her two for the 150 dollars, she says,

‚ÄúGive me one now and let me go dance for an hour. I‚Äôll get another one off of you lickety split, if you just wait. Go inside. Get a drink or a lap dance or something. It won‚Äôt take long. I promise.‚Äù

‚ÄúHere.‚Äù I hand her a prebagged gram and get out with her. We walk back slowly. She doesn‚Äôt say anything until we get back to the club.

‚ÄúK. Go inside and hang out for a bit. I‚Äôll call you as soon as I‚Äôm ready.‚Äù

I walk in and get a Sprite from the bar. It‚Äôs cold and sweet and the plastic cup is wet in my hand. I meander around watching the few men with their bills and the girls dancing for them. Lynyrd Skynyrd plays. Pretty soon Charlie‚Äôs ex-sister-in-law makes an appearance on stage. She‚Äôs quite short. Almost some kind of dwarf or something and has a scar on her stomach like a jagged bolt of lightning. It‚Äôs not so easy to see in the dark, but it‚Äôs there. On the other end of the stage a taller girl with a big face and mouth and a thick pair of thoroughbred thighs dances awkwardly, and I start to feel embarrassed for them in a way. Not like I‚Äôm better than they are or anything like that, but I do. It just makes me embarrassed, so I look away from the stage and wander through a set of velvet curtains and a doorway to the back.

Reggaeton thumps over the speakers back here. Pink and green neon tubes glow along the walls and above our heads. In one corner a white light strobes next to a fat man with a headset, and in another corner a girl lap dances for a man in a chair. It‚Äôs hard for me to see from the distance. Other girls talk amongst themselves. A stripper with cigarette breath walks toward me asks me if I want a dance. She must be the oldest girl in the place. I say,

‚ÄúNah. I‚Äôm just looking around,‚Äù and shake the ice in my cup at her. I‚Äôm not sure why. Maybe, I‚Äôm subconsciously indicating my lack of interest in hers or anyone else‚Äôs services there, and even though I‚Äôm not interested--I‚Äôm really not--something over her shoulder catches my eye.

It‚Äôs a thin girl with a dark face and a straight blonde wig. She is looking directly at me. Her shoulders point down in collapsed posture. Her irises are black charcoal, and the white of those desperate eyes shine wet. They swell in sadness. I turn my focus back to the older one I just shook my drink at,

‚ÄúWhat about her?‚Äù I point with my chin to the frail and delicate figure sulking behind her.

‚ÄúHer?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. What‚Äôs her name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, honey. Why don‚Äôt you ask her? I think it‚Äôs her first night.‚Äù

The older stripper steps out of the way letting me get full view of the girl behind her. She stands there as sad as I thought she looked just a moment before. I ask her,

‚ÄúYou give lap dances?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor me?‚Äù

She nods at me chewing her fingernail. The girl turns and walks toward a chair across the room and turns to see me still standing there. It may sound clich√©, but she really is like something from my dreams, and this whole scene something I‚Äôve done before. I think it‚Äôs what they call D√©j√† vu. You know? I have this theory about it which is that the reason we find ourselves in situations which seems so familiar is that we‚Äôve done all these things an infinite number of times into eternity past as the universe and time explode out of nothing to create everything and collapse back in on themselves and do it all over and over again into eternity. She moves slowly in this dreamy fog, an angel in the darkness. I recognize her. I know her. I snap out of it and follow her to a chair against the wall.",1544335532.0

This has made sobriety boring. Go to work, come home, watch TV or play videos, go to bed, and then repeat.

When I'm using...that's a whole different lifestyle. It's just exciting. Hanging out with your addict friend and trying to cold cop at 2AM. Middling for someone and getting a big sack for it is better than a paycheck with overtime. Hanging out in trap houses meeting random ass people. Feeling the rush of a good pickup, knowing it's going to last you longer than any you've had this month. Snorting lines in a public bathroom with your buddy...

I'm not one for meetings or NA, Ive tried to get into them but its so hard for me. Ive been an IV user for about a year now. I just found out my s/o of three years is cheating on me, he's currently in rehab in another state. He was my reason for even getting clean, because if it was up to me, I would've loved to never wake up from my last overdose. I'm just in a complete state of fucking misery and all i can think about is that rig. The rush.

So I guess I just hate the effects of hydrocodone/oxycodone/fentanyl.

God. Only took like a week of use for me to feel a difference when I ran out. That bitch is sneaky ! 

Anyone else randomly buy a g of black and just assume you won't like it ? Anyone ? Am I the only complete moron here ? Probably. If I end up spiraling down into a hole of opiate addiction, at least I didn't start with a script.  I'm tired of that statistic being spouted off.  The scripts made me \*avoid\* heroin for the longest time because I get so ill on oxy, hydro and codeine. Fuckers I started by injecting heroin, I just went straight to end game. 

Thankfully, I have been more careful than the oral surgeon I had a decade ago who overdosed me with fentanyl and I had to be narcanned awake. Holy fuck that isn't fun, even if you're not addicted. I hadn't ever taken opiates and my first experience was an overdose with the misfortune of also having versed in the mix so I don't even remember the good part!

But yeah. Heroin is pretty fucking amazing. This ain't gonna end well... I'm officially out again and am resisting picking up. Wish me luck with making do with the kilo of kratom I've had forever. I wish you could smoke kratom....

Now I'm not here to lecture on saftey or anything but just be aware, when you snap a photo on one of these smartphones it also convienently saves a ton of info; everything from the exact GPS location of where it was taken, the device info and more.. that you may or may not want the world to know as It can essentially identify you without any effort as its embedded in the photo.

Just going through some of the more recent posts and pulled a few to see and sure enough people aren't always taking that step.

I have heard reddit may include this in the future by stripping the photo of exif but for now, just be aware.

You can always remove the exif data very easily with one of many free apps that strip it free of any info whatsoever and takes almost no effort, just one step prior to posting that could be of interest to those who'd rather keep that info to themselves.

I understand many do not care and I respect that and am not telling you what to do. I'm simply pointing this out to anyone who may not be aware that they can prevent this very easily and quite frankly I'm pretty sure many wouldn't want their personal information attatched to a drug post.

I thought it was just for the long holiday, so I bought my 8th as usual and plus tools needed for work. But then we get there Monday to find out we've been laid off. I had no more money left too buy anything for my dopesickness. I wish they'd have told us that Wednesday so I didn't spend so much on h and used some to buy some math too help me get off the h.

Usually I‚Äôll binge with a full script give or take a few every two to three months and don‚Äôt find any problems with withdrawal or anything. Generally can resist urges to redose pretty well. Been able to do this without problems for about 8 years. I also have a pretty wide range of experience with and enjoy a range of other chemicals much more regularly (daily) (herb, ket, cocaine, klonopin). Although I tend to keep my drugs on rotation.  I‚Äôm kind of curious about trying intranasal heroin though? I don‚Äôt hold any stigma about IV/IMing I just have an aversion to it. I have a few questions:
1) how would the high differ from the feeling of oxy or hydro?
2) is the addiction potential significant compared to other things I take?
3) what are appropriate steps towards harm reduction? (Narcan obviously)
4) what dose would you recommend to start?

Reasons I believe it could be something else:
‚Ä¢ When it kicks I cant see straight. My eyes feel weird and I need to close one eye in order to read words on my phone otherwise all the words are blurry and crossed over each other. 
‚Ä¢ When I close my eyes to go to sleep if I am still high, I start to hear weird shit. Like almost dream like shit while I am still awake. 
‚Ä¢ After an hour and a half (ROA = snorting) it starts to feel much much less intense and my vision slowly goes back to normal
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôve been using for 9 days, multiple times per day. I used a little too much today and now only 2 hours after snorting my head starts killing me, I feel nauseous (thrown up twice), weak, and aggravated.
‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs much weaker than 99% 
‚Ä¢ I experience a calm contentness but I‚Äôve never felt Euphoria even after plugging good amounts

This powder smells similar to black tar when snorted. When I smoke it I feel very out of it and almost high like I just faced a joint. I don‚Äôt like how it feels so I have  only been snorting. Smoking makes it way more noticeable.

But I digress. Ima take another fat dab, smoke a blunt, toot an addy and pour up a glass of the rye, neat.

Hello Guys & Girls hope your having a fab friday !
I did use the search button but i have so many questions!

I have a fairly high codeine dose 300-400mg and im new to opiates.
Will be doing half the pill so about 12-20 mg , hard to be  spot on with a razor blade, tried to be as gentle as possible without crushing the pill


Q1)
I have read that 10-20mg is a good starting dose , the problem is the pills have no split line running down the middle , so people say its a bad idea to cut them yourself?

Due to the fact its not very accurate (unless you have a pilcutter) and there could be more substance in one side of the pill compared to others?

Q2)
How long should i wait to redose>

q3) I took 25mg promethinze 30 mins before taking oxy, to counter attack the itchness/ nause.
Is this a good dose , as i dont want to take to much promethainze due to its sedating effect and for respiratory depression side effect..

Q4) When is best time frame to drop the anti histamine ( promethinze)

Before / During/ After coming up? The last option dos not sound to good because it says like its late to the part and the Oxycontin would of caused histamines to be released = Nause/Itchness.

q5) What would be a safe time frame (Hours) to go to sleep?

q6) How long after taking oxy dos it usually take to start working?
Q7) Are prolonged release pills a crap high compared to  standard pill?",1544222765.0

I liturary had my mobile in my hand about to phone my guy in town when he phoned the house phone so I'm like yeah that would be perfect ! He then goes on to say he needs to just pop into town to get some valium and he will be straight back ! FFS why did you phone me when your waiting on the fucking  bus ?? So I say ok no problem I know if he's quick he can jump off the bus go score and there will be a bus heading back to mine making the entire journey take about 40/50minutes. 
    He phoned me exactly 30minuted later and says that's him at the bus stop and he will be with me just shortly . 

So 50 minutes go by and I try phoning him and it goes directly to voice mail oh my fucking god !! But I know this can mean two things the cunt is now blanking me or he's almost here as the Giff Gaff signal here is utter crap and I virtually have to hang out my upstairs bedroom window to get a reception ! To add insult to Injury they have just built a new antenna down by the shops where a large telephone exchange is based . But it looks like the cheap bastards have not chipped in and don't have an antenna on the mast ! I've heard it was put up by vodaphone and they now have full bars and top notch internet speeds ! Wankers !! After a couple of minutes I try again and it rings, he answers and says he's just coming into the village so I tell him I'll meet him at the bus stop at the pub and I head out to get him but I take the back way and he goes the other way and doesn't wait outside the pub . So I phone him and he's at the top of the road so I tell him to wait and I'll catch up to him. I see him talking to someone but they have their hood up and I can't make out who it is but it turns out to be someone I know and he's a right thieving bastard ! He can't help him self every shop etc he goes in he steals something even when he doesn't need to and you need to watch him like a hawk if he's in your house. He asks my new dealer if he's looking for any kit (heroin) or valium but my guy doesn't need any . He then tells me his friend got his heroin about a half Oz ,¬£80 and 27 strips of valium stolen when he fell a sleep and this guy was in the house and he asked him to keep his ear to the ground . So this just confirmed it ! Stuff goes missing and this idiot starts punting ! Lol doesn't take a genius to figure this out ! 

  We get to my house and he asks me if I have any foil and scales as they are all made up into half grams and i just want a bag .I tell him the foil is no problem but the two sets of scales I have are both fucked and need calibrated and I don't have the proper weights to calibrate them . So we will have to do it by eye and he lets me do it so I put out the powder onto a DVD case and make it into a rectangle and half it down diagonal and obviously take the bigger half for myself . He put his on the foil and I cook mine up, the powder is a bit darker in colour than the stuff I've been getting recently and it's pretty good stuff so this stuff is going to have some competition on its hands. I shoot it up and I feel it in my nose and start getting pins and needles across the back of my neck and scalp . Not bad ! Not bad indeed ! I was quite surprised as the stuff in town was quite good itself. 
           So after he's smoked his he phoned his friend and tells him about that idiot trying to sell him kit and valium. A couple of hours go by and we have a couple of nice cappacinoes in my new machine and I make him some wheatabix  and some boiled eggs(4) in a cup mashed up in some butter and some salt. 

 I end up getting another bag from him and he does one himself but this time he wants to inject and I have loads of new tools(syringes) but his veins are total shit. So I tell him I'll get him in the groin not a problem and his face lights up. Cook up the bags and I do mine first a boom what a rush ! On top of that first bag I get a really good hit and feel a bit funny I almost say to him to keep an eye on me and where the Naloxone is but it passed and I feel alright . I get him not a problem and he gets a really good dunt from it and we are both high as kites ! (I must be still high as fuck coz this is turning into a book ! Lol ) 
          He ends up phoning  his guy to give him his money and to find out when he can pick up again . So he gets directions to mine. He turns up and I have to go to the post office to get the tenner I owe him and my friend wants to go to his bit about a mile away and this guy ain't happy about that as he says he's in a rush but he does it any way as my m8 liturary goes in the huff like a fucking 5 years old ! We end up arguing and nearly fighting because I tell him he's acting like a 5 year old . He's says do you want to sort it out outside the van and I tell him go ahead your next to the door you fucking idiot but he backs down and we head to his bit. When he's in the house I ask the guy what his prices are and if I can have his number he say yeah no problem but don't say to ***** he'll go in the huff for stealing his customer he was only adding a fiver to an eighth(¬£85) anyway so it's not like he was losing out on much.plus this guy will deliver it straight to my door . He gets back in the van and he got his trays of gabbas as someone was wanting to buy 200 of him at a fiver a tray and there's ten in a tray. He drops him off at the bookies and I ask him if he can drop me off at my house as he needs to turn around anyway and if he just follows the road after my bit it'll take him into town.
   
 So turned out not to bad today plus my m8 says he'll drop a bag off every morning about 9/10am so thats handy and he will do me tick(credit) not a problem.

  Hope everyone is having a good day and not in WD if you don't want to be or worse you have money but can't score ! All the best from bonnie Scotland !

Basically, I've been diagnosed with bipolar I for a long time now and still have yet to find the right treatment. I've been through about 10+ different treatments in my life (started about 5 years ago). I recently stopped using the Seroquel XR (quetiapine 600mg) I was prescribed and felt instant relief from suicidal ideation and weird psychotic visions. No idea why I decided to end it, it just seemed like a dangerous thing to me, even though I had been taking it for 6 months, somehow I started having a bad reaction to it.

So today I'm with my psychiatrist and nurse and ask what the next possible line of treatment is, highly suggesting stopping the antipsychotic route since I've been through 3 of them already with no success and too much sedation. The psychiatrist looks at me in a condescending way and says as long as I still take heroin it's ""too complicated"" so I should just stop and also not even consider a substitute in order to proceed.

So here I am crying next to my doctor in the heroin shooting room next to the train station (yes we have these facilities), feeling utterly blocked and misunderstood.

Does this woman thinks I can just be like ""hey yeah lets just stop taking heroin"" from one day to the next ? Doesn't she think the causality of this situation is to be turned around and maybe focus on treating core illness first ? Does she realize I haven't been off treatment like this in 5 years and I feel extremely unstable right now ?

That's it. Thanks. I just needed to vent. ",1544218638.0

1)  You accidently drop your bag into a port-a-potty toilet....

Would you go in after it? Or would you let it go? 

2) Your grandmother hands you $20 to go purchase groceries.  You've been sick for two days and have nothing to pawn, no cash.. etc 

Would you... take the money to buy dope and steal the food from the grocery store? Or get grandma her milk, bread and eggs like the good little grandchild you are and continue feeling shit?

3) You are walking home after picking up and realize that you've dropped your bag.  You back track and realize that the bag has fallen into a puddle of the greasiest,chunkiest, stinkiest pile of vomit you've ever encountered...the dope itself was loosley wrapped with plastic from a grocery store sack and is not sealed...you pluck it out and realize that some of it got wet with the vomit. 

Would you...shrug your shoulders and say.. meh? Knowing that the second you get home you plan to do it anyway or throw your hands up and say fuck it... I would rather be sick than take a chance?

4)  You are in jail and a new girl/guy gets placed into your cell.  Let's say, it's just the two of you..  your new celly explains that they have a good sized chunk of dope shoved up inside the old prison wallet but they will need help to remove it.  

Would you.. get your fingers lubed up and tell your celly to get down on all fours while you assist with the ""digging"" or.. Would you rather help them paw through their feces for the next week in hopes of being the one to find the buried treasure ? ",1544209991.0

I have been on an about 9 month (?) Ish opiate binge starting with 2 100mcg mylan fentanyl patches that almost literally fell into my lap. Cut them bitches up and stuck 'em on my butt cheeks over the course of 2 and a half weeks (this was after being clean for around 4 months.)

Fentanyl ran out, developed horrible cravings and inability to sleep. Figured out how to use the Dnm (why the fuck did that take me so long? Fuck me) got a shit ton of oxy 40's cause some dude in Europe was selling them for like $5 a pop. That lasted me a few months, never exceeding 40mg in a day but often sticking to 20/30mg. 

Ran out and decided it was time to let the love affair go (again) so ordered some subs (5) with the intent of taking 1mg a day and tapering over the course of a couple weeks as I did before. One order of 5 subs turned into 2. Then 3. Been talking subs for the past several months at the rate of 1-2mg a day. If I go 24 hours and don't do a dose I can feel the restlessness/anxiety/boredom/depression start to set in so I always go back.

Went on like this for a while until I saw some morphine 30xrs on the Dnm for what seemed like a pretty cheap price. Got 5 of them. Made the mistake of taking 2 only 24 hours after my last sub dose contrary to many peoples advice (I should have listened to you guys/the FAQ!) Next day about 36 hours later took one and chewed it up and took another one whole. 

Holy shit that had me feeling great! Ate half of the last one about 4 hours in and then the other half about 8 hours in. It's been 3 days since that last dose and I haven't taken shit except 1mg of alp to sleep. I mean, I would like to take some more opiates but I'm not really craving or having any negative side effects. I even have about 5mg of bupe just chillin. Haven't even looked at it.

What the fuck morphine. Thanks fam.

They're so hard and miserable.  I could easily go through what I have coming towards me if I didn't already know that the worst part is when the WDs end and I'm just numb. I know TV will be less enjoyable, I probably won't even enjoy playing games like I used to, social interaction will feel lackluster,  the anticipation of exciting events will be not so exciting. I've done it.  It was horrifying.  It's terrifying to think my brain just won't recognize natural positive stimulation as rewarding.  All the things I did while high were enjoyable because I was high. 

WDs aren't even on my radar. I went through months of Benz withdrawal hell.  

What I want to do is slowly taper while introducing small natural rewarding things to compensate.  I want to start with physical activities that take less mental focus. Like skating,  climbing,  swimming,  fishing,  etc.  I really don't know yet. I watch these YouTube videos of people just having so much motivation and focus and drive that I envy beyond belief. They look higher streaming a game or teaching some random hobby than I've ever been on drugs. 

There's this science channel with destin that is really popular and the guy is so unbelievably excited and happy all the time just talking about science.  I want to be excited  about anything naturally. 

I know I can't just dive into programming or something like that,  but if I can find a physical hobby and slowly start getting clean I can take baby steps.  I think I need something to take me out of my comfort zone and force me to focus on like community college.  Find a program that I may enjoy while also forcing myself to give up free time. 

What do you guys think? Does any of this make sense.  I cant just quit and be bored.  I really want it to work and enjoy real life things.  I don't want to just say I'll exercise.  If I'm going to exercise it's going to be through recreation. ",1544201947.0

&#x200B;

One of my older siblings is texting me right now.  They struggled with an opiate addiction for a long time and overcame it; we were all really proud of them.  This past year has been really rough on them.  They lost their job last month and had a really nasty breakup awhile before that.  Either way, they've been texting me a lot recently and venting (which is great just because we have not had a very emotional or honest relationship in the past, so I'm glad they feel comfortable coming to me for help), and I've been happy to provide advice.  But tonight they told me that they recently used for a couple of days and then stopped and are currently going through withdraw symptoms.

&#x200B;

Basically, what I'm worried about is just how much honesty there is here.  It's been years since they regularly used (as far as I know) but when they were using a lot there was a lot of dishonesty, theft, etc.  That was probably four years ago, maybe more, and I really want to believe them when they say that it was just a couple of days and they're working to get back off of it.  I'm just not sure how to proceed from here without being confrontational or overbearing but still knowing where they stand.

&#x200B;

They've told me that it's been eight days since they last used.  I'm worried that I'm making something out of nothing but I'm also worried that I'm not doing enough.  Their addiction years ago left a pretty huge impact on my family that we've worked really hard to rebuild from.  I'd like to believe that they are older now and more mature and know that going back to using isn't going to solve their issues, but I guess I'm also a bit cynical now.  They first starting using when I was around eleven or twelve (they were fifteen-sixteen at the time) and a lot of my pre-teen and teen years were spent feeling like a needed to hide my money/belongings or else they would steal them and sell them for drugs.  I'm now twenty-two and we have done a lot to rebuild our relationship but I still feel like I am worried about going back to that time when I didn't feel safe in my own home.

My doctor started giving out/prescribing weed cards!  

The office was packed and a little less than half of the people were getting a weed card.   Where I live the county doesn‚Äôt allow dispensaries, closest one is 3 hours away, but there are mobile dispensaries a few times a week in town.

However, again my county doesn‚Äôt allow sales of recreational even though its legal in California.  So you need a card to buy from one of the mobile dispensary.  (Neighbor told me - I don‚Äôt smoke weed)

Oh AND the weed patients, they seem to be organized under the pill mill operational handbook also, the patients were in and out! 

FOR THE WEED KNOWLEDGABLE? 
I don‚Äôt know a lot about weed laws, I‚Äôm surprised because I thought doctors were not allowed to give cards out.  They were all paying $55, I don‚Äôt know if that means anything to you.  I thought a special doctor who only did weed cards could give them, not a primary care provider, or pain management doctor.  

Also it makes me wonder about the pain patients, does that mean weed can show up on their drug tests cause they can get a weed card from their

a3vpdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a3vpdf/having_these_weird_blackouts/,10,https://redd.it/a3vpdf,xxan_marino,Having these weird blackouts..,"So last Friday this started happening. Had to get my ativan script and they had a script of amitriptyline also that Dr had called in. Popped 2.5mg ativan and went home. I got curious and decided to try and sniff a half 25mg amitryptyline pill. Didn't like it tossed the rest of the powder but took a pill and the other half. 30 mins went by I felt regular, took another .5 ativan then went to meet my friend for a couple bags

When I met up I sniffed two bags right away and within 2 mins hopped in my car with a bun to bring to my other friend. This is where the blackout started but I was later reminded of a text and a call at this time that I vaguely remember.... Next thing I know I wake up in my car parked in a pull off spot wondering Wtf.. 10 bags still in my pocket, wallet.. But no phone.. So I went to the friends who ordered the bun and all lights are off.. Dudes car not there. But I can hear his son inside trying to be quiet. At this point I thought it was weird being only 7pm.

So I just went home for the time being since my dboy buddy was making a run. Keep in mind I don't have his or the other guys numbers at this point. Try to get myself together but just can't remember shit. Knowing this dude is the only one who can give me any answers I go there again. This time he's home. Knock on the door and the son opens gives me my sim card and tells me I gotta go I can't be here.

So I told him I have no idea what happened and where's my phone. Then the guy calls me up stairs and begins to enlighten me as he pulls every piece of my phone from a diff corner of the room lol.

He said I pulled in, got out my car and could barely walk or talk. I was nodding like an od but breathing and responding. He I guess panicked since they lost someone there in the past. And took me in my car to the spot I woke up in. Now he is an old skool guy did time for delivery blah blah. He said he was check-in on me every minute or two and each time I responded more and more. says he would of called for help if it was bad bad. Not saying he did the right thing but I woke up fine and would of been a whole lot more pissed if I was in a ambulance in precipitated wd. But obviously an od would of been absolute worst scenario. Would of love to wake up to the answers right from him but he had to get fixed.. Could of just took his order out my pocket but I guess some of his morals are still there.

So I learned my lesson and thought I knew exactly what I did wrong. Also I have never had this happen with ativan alone with dope let alone sniffing it not shooting. The dope is white most likely fent or a mixture. So everyday after this when I sniffed a bag as soon as it took effect id black out I guess. My buddy has told me I was nodding out and he was slapping me..no memory. We were in a store he says I was walking into doors and he had to help me walk back to the car. Which is when I snapped out of the black out. Then yesterday everything was goin fine. I did a bag and started rolling a blunt and went into blackout mode. Pearled the backwoods but I guess dropped it in the grass. So I snap out of this blackout all groggy with him yelling ""you just had it in ur hand"".. Im like what we looking for?lol. He did find it in the grass.

Im convinced its either the dope or the first amitryptyline/benzo blackout/od that might have fucked with my brain.. If that's possible. The other times after that I was either on 0 ativan or 1mg or less. Sorry for such long post but I want to know if anyone else has similar experience. Also I would normally not hesitate to blow 3-5 bags and used to iv way more than that. But its something about this dope. Flushing the anti depressants I want nothing to do w em. They were ""for pain"" anyway.

Being scared of PWD and away from home, I attempted to induce subs by waiting 12ish hours, then taking a very small dose (.25-.5 mg?) every few hours, followed by a little dope. Rinse, repeat. This worked great....for a day or two.

Then I ran out. (Didn't plan to do this so all I had was crumbs.) About 6 hours later, got the ""cells are all cramping individually"" feeling, sweating, etc. 

In a possibly very stupid move, I took 2mg of subs, remembering everyone saying ""once you're on bupe, you're fine!"" .... I'd guess I had 2-4 mg in me before this. 

An hour later: full on, terrible, flopping like a fish, the slightest draft  like 40 grit sandpaper on my skin, writhing in agony etc. Worse than turkey by far. Took 8mg more, because I would have done anything to stop it, to no effect.

So...clearly I just had enough h in me still that there was enough to be knocked off by that last 2mgs, possibly combined w/ enough of a habit that subs alone wouldn't completely stop wds. 

BUT why was this so terrible when I already had a decent amount of bupe in me? What I'm wondering is: 

(1) if I made it worse by stacking the subs with the dope (a ton of partially agonized receptors + the rest fully agonized =  more than normal)? 

OR did I just up my sub dose too soon/too much?

and (2) How much bupe do you need in your system to be sure that you won't get precipitated wds? 

(Dunno if I would try this again, but I had read a study or two about a similar, way more controlled version of this method that had great success--can anyone can remind me of it's name?)",1544146693.0

I've spoken to my parents about it and asked for help and they've been really supportive and dad has even offered to send me to a rehab and take it out of my inheritance (he's not rich so it's not like it's some massive inheritance fund, thus a 3 month rehab stint (costs about 30-40k here) would put a major dint into it but that's not my issue.  My issue is that i'm going to need a very large time window to start healing and i'll probably need about 6-12 months of really hard work to get into a less hopeless position.  Now i tried to just come off morphine and jump on to kratom but my habit is too big and the kratom wasn't holding me plus it wasn't really putting a dent in my pain.  I'm so fkn lost, i really don't know what to do at this point this seems insurmountable and i've just been crying all day.  I dont even have any money to go for a fkn swim because my habit consumes all my money and i'm not even getting high now just barely staying well and getting some pain relief.  


My options are basically try and taper with opium, its too hard with morphine because i've abused it too much. Or come clean to my doctor, ask for help get on to a pain management dose of methadone or suboxone and maybe go to rehab or go live with family and slowly work through this.  I'm just so worried that i won't be able to taper methadone or subs like i can with opium, i've read soooo many horror stories about people getting on and never coming off or facing horrendous month long WDs just when they drop a tiny dose.  When tapering things like opium, morphine you can drop your dose and you're a bit off for a day then your body gets used to it but it seems way more extreme with done/subs.  Now if i go to rehab they're gonna taper me with one of those and i'm just worried i'll never get off if i start.  FTR, yes i have severe chronic pain but it is curable with a lot of work/willpower/mind control thus why i'm worried about tapering.  If i knew 100% i was going to have to be a lifer, which i will be if i don't put in the work soon i think id have no hesitation with using done as my main med but that's not the case and if i'm going to go into recovery and start putting in work i dont want to switch on to a drug i cant get off.


So, what i'm looking for is accounts of people who have successfully tapered methadone/subs though probably prefer done because it seems to be a much better pain killer.  How was your taper?  How long were you on it for and what dose reduction/timeframe period did you do it under?  Did you have bad WDs every time you dropped a dose?  Did you have a month of acute WDs when you finally hopped off?  Thanks, i really need some guidance right now, this feels absolutely hopeless and my parents while supportive don't know what to do either really.  The hole is so fkn deep i can't see a way out right now i'm in such a dark place. Sigh",1544144097.0

So when I got out I got passed off to some random doc who first said he was going to completely stop my opioids, no taper. I convinced him that was a BAD idea and he did a 180 degree turn and agreed to keep prescribing but reduce by like 5%.. no big deal. Except that was temporary and he wants me to go see pain management. Now, I have a history with this pain management place and they actually kicked me out (for only taking my long acting drug not the short acting one for a few days because I was feeling well. So kicked out for NOT taking enough drugs). They eventually accepted me back but refused to prescribe any narcotics. Wasn‚Äôt a big deal because my PCP was cool with it.

I relapsed about 2 months ago, I spent the whole month of October on a 150-250mg of oxy a day. My grandpa passed away in the beginning of November and it was enough to sober me up and try and get off the pills before it got too bad. I bought enough Suboxone to ""wing me"" off, but ended up abusing them too. 

So I decided to just do it cold turkey at the start of this month. Now, a little back story about myself I am a manager at a large corporate retail store. I decided today to go grab some Xanax to help with the RLS and insomnia. I was on the way to the bank to drop deposits, when I took a detour to my plugs spot. Unknown to me my bookbag which held the deposits is wide open and basically D boy hops in the back of my car, serves me and leaves. 

When I got to the bank I realized my mistake and one of the deposits is missing. One that's $945... I have literally $7 to my name and don't get paid till Wednesday. I basically have till tomorrow to figure something out. My only thought was just use today's deposit to basically cover the one that got stolen and so on till I get paid Wednesday and can fix it myself. I've worked so hard to get in this position I am in now and I literally just want to jump out my window right now or run away. 

I'm not just messing with a mom and pop shop. We have LP to worry about. Basically the Golden rule is you have 7 days to drop a deposit before it gets turned to LP. The one that got stolen from me was the deposit on 12/30 so I have till tomorrow to drop it. The only thing I can see working for me is it'll be the weekend after that and LP wouldn't put a notice out till Monday morning. That basically gives me 3 days to figure something out. 

I am an addict and we are the most resourceful people there are. So throw some prayers and best of luck wishes my way. Any advice or questions please bring my way!! I could use all or any help guys. Thanks.",1544126459.0

Also this is going to be long, so sorry in advance.

So I've known this girl, we'll call her Sam, since I was 5.  I'm 28 now and shes 27.  We went to kindergarten together, then she moved to a private school but ended up being in my English class in 10th grade.  I remember seeing her walk in, being the ""new girl"" and honestly for me it was love at first sight.  She was and imo still is the most gorgeous creature I have ever laid eyes on.  And to top it off she has such a beautiful soul.  We dated briefly in highschool but I cut it off because I thought we would be better as friends.  However after a heartbreak I push people away. We didnt talk from age 17 to 21, where we reconnected. Started partying together etc etc but were never more than best friends.  And I mean best friends, we were together almost every day for 4 years.  Then right after my 25th birthday I decided to move out of state to get my mind right.  I was falling into addiction, not a specific drug but anything I could get my hands on.  The breaking point for me was when i got paid and was negative $900 in my account the same day.  I left for 4 months, went up to North Dakota, tiny town in the middle of nowhere.  I grew so much up there.  I learned who my real friends are.  Who were only faking to get a discount on all the drugs I had.  So I come back and me and her are hanging out every day, she starts dating this weed dealer that moves 40lbs a week and his house got raised then she was on the 24/7 sober program and had to get a UA done twice a day.  So friday she asked me of she could come hangout Saturday and if I could give her a ride to the jail at 9am, I said of course I would.  But I went and got so plastered that  night I could barely get out of bed. Said fuck it jail is only a few blocks from my house, let her take my car.  An hour goes by I call her she doesnt pick up. She called me 20 minutes later saying she got t boned by a cop that ran a red light because he had 2 people in custody in his back seat that were fighting and he was trying to get them to the jail asap. 

She broke her back in the accident.  Got put on Opana 80s 120 of them a month.  But then she turned 26 and got cut off from her moms health  insurance.  She started buying on the Street but it got too expensive. So she started  IVing the pills but her tolerance went up.  So she switched to heroin and fent just in an effort to save money.   She called me summer of last year.  We hadn't hung out in a long time, mainly because I got the feeling her boyfriend was jealous of me getting so much of her attention, and I didnt want to be that guy that got in the way.  They had eventually broken up. 

But she started staying over a lot.  Sleeping in my bed.  Hanging out 24/7, helping me hustle.  I fell in love with her.  More than I have with anyone. But then the cracks started to show. Eventually it came out that she was using heroin. She went to jail, twice.  Most of the last year actually.  But she reached out to me in July of this year, she had just gotten out after 6 months, is on probation, we hung out the entire weekend. 

I realized even after everything I still loved her, she had said she was clean, and she wasn't nodding out which was a plus. She had the soul of a lion I'd tell her.  But weekend came and went and I dropped her off at her moms in the and her mom called me to tell me she got arrested as soon as I dropped her off because of a probation violation.  So I put money on her books, went and visited her.  I told her I loved her every time I spoke with her. I thought hey maybe this time she will actually stay clean, I wished it so bad.

She got out 2 or 3 weeks ago.  And other than a couple days on the weekend, we hung out every day.  I didnt really think much of us not hanging out for a couple days I mean fuck I had her with me 5 or 6 days at a time.

Then about 12 days after she got out, she got deathly I'll.  She said she thinks she has a blood infection because she used to IV.  Tells me these things can take months to show symptoms which is actually true based on my research.  I took her to the hospital, she has endocarditis, although thankfully doesnt need surgery.  Shes in for 7 days and get out.  While she was in there she asked me to bring her kpins which I personally dont have a problem with just that shes in the fucking ICU fighting for her life.  Her mom tells me a couple days later that she admitted to her doctor that she shot meth the couple days we didnt hangout .  I got so mad that she lied to me,  not because she used, but that she lied.  I had found a needle in my shower 2 days before I took her to the hospital and she said it was old from before she went to jail, and she found it in her purse and was going to throw it away. All lies I'm guessing now.

Last night she got out of the hospital, yelled at me because her mom tore apart her room.  I didnt tell her why I had told her mom that, i wanted to wait until later that night.  She came over we hung out for about 45 minutes.  She got a phone call that she said this guy was going to come pick her up to swing a couple miles down the road to sell some of her xanax.  She told me she'd be gone for 30 minutes tops.  I knew it would be at least an hour since she had septic joints I knew she would be moving slow to begin with. 

I had messaged her in Facebook telling her to call me when she got back, so I could open the garage so that she wouldn't have to walk up my icy steps in her condition.  She wasn't active on Facebook for the whole 2 hours since she left.  I called her at 5 till 1am because I needed to go to bed.  She didnt pickup.  She was then active on Facebook literally after I hung up the phone.  I dont usually try to micromanage people but after everything she has put me through the past year and a half, even though I love the fuck out of her, I have problems trusting her.  But I basically blew up on her, told her she was being a swerve and she should have just told me shes not coming back.  She didnt text me back until 4am said she was out running hustles and had to be because she owed people money because her mom went through her room.

Like why the fuck not just be honest about that if that was the truth. While yes I want her to get clean,  I'm not going to judge her about her drug use.  I've smoked crack, I've done heroin.  Pills, molly you name it, I've done it all, I've just been fortunate enough to not fall into addiction to any of it, I always knew there was a line that was a giant cliff into a pitt that you could fall into, and I knew I didnt want to fall  into it.

I have other people in my life that are just friends, that are completely open about their addictions.  Mainly heroin addicts.  But she is the one I love.  And she is the only one that lies to me about it. It drives me crazy.

Like fuck man I feel so powerless. Like what can I do to help her.  What should I say to her to let her know its okay to be a fuck up. Like fuck man, my heart is bleeding over this

I had just gotten a new batch of H in, and did more than I usually do. I didn't feel too high, but after about an hour I noticed my hands were trembling a bit. I thought nothing of it, until about thirty minutes later my jaw started spasming uncontrollably.

I could not control my jaw. My teeth were clattering, my jaw was trembling, I couldn't talk and it would not stop. I was driving when this happened, and all of a sudden my leg started to have intense muscle spasms that were so bad that I could not keep the peddle down. This turned into about forty five minutes of my entire body just freaking out. I was jerking around because my jaw, legs, and most of my body was having crazy muscle contractions.

I got home safely, took some multivitamins, xananx, and drank some water and orange juice. It eventually stopped and I felt completely fine. I did some research and found that opioid abuse can cause something called myoclonus, which is what I just described.

Has anyone else had this happen? Should I be worried? It was by far the craziest thing that has happened to me.

TLDR; Snorted some drugs, after an hour my body freaked out for about an forty five minutes with intense, uncontrollable muscle spasms.",1544116674.0

Laughing, I replied 'What are you going to say next you've done it yourself'. He nodded, and explained that he had done heroin, during his 20s for around a year, no more than 25 times. He described himself as not addicted. I then asked what every-one who hasn't taken heroin must ask when confronted with such a situation, ""what does it feel like"". He replied with ""the most pleasurable feeling I've ever felt, like being wrapped up in a blanket, feeling safe"". Shocked, I could barely reply. I felt uneasy the rest of the evening, and a few weeks later, still feel a little uneasy each time I remember that moment. This unease, as expected, partly comes from the shock that a man who doesn't do any drugs, is actually rather boring haha, has done H. But most of all, it is the way he described it as the best. Is it truly the most pleasurable feeling? Can you get addicted after 20 hits over the course of a year?

&#x200B;

Whats more, I realise such narcism is deplorable, but is every feeling of happiness since taking the drug a lesser emotion in comparison? Does one spend the rest of their lives remembering H as the best feeling, and every other feeling of enjoyment is slightly greyer, slightly tarred, slightly less?

Okay, so, to sum it up, I've got a form of Marfan's Syndrome that has caused numerous problems, bone related and the like, and have recently undergone the second of two halves of a rare surgery where my ribcage needed reshaped. The first surgery I had to relearn how to walk, had to sleep sitting up, and did not return to ""base normal."" The second surgery left me significantly more normal, but has further disfigured my ribcage and left radiating pain further than before, including inflammation. Note: the surgery was initially done because my heart and lungs were being crushed to 20% operating capacity, and prior to the surgery I would've had only an additional 7-9 years left to live (I was 17 at the time, this was a few years ago, and second surgery was a week ago.) 

To the point: I have been to my doctor for a few various short term scripts in recent times, such as Adderall, an albuterol inhaler, and Valium (have stopped the Adderall as well as Valium.) My script for post-surgical Norco has run dry (roughly one tenth the amount that was given to me for the first surgery, understandable because of the vast differences but not enough in total) and tylenol and ibuprofen are not going to be enough in total, and alone, for dealing with the remaining ringing pain that is going to be present due to muscles, bone, and nerves having to be cut. Its irritating, mostly because I know a low-level painkiller would do the trick but is next to impossible to achieve due to the further regulating being done around opiates. I don't want to try to ask my doctor and seem like a ""drug seeker"" considering in the last month I've had two high-schedule drugs prescribed in the short term (valium for seizures, adderall for lack of concentration and thought process) of which they tried to pawn me off to a neuropsychlogist for the valium script (again, I went for seizures.) 

The question: What are the legal measures (if there even are any) to take if I were to drive to a town in Canada (I don't live all that far away in the U.S.,) purchase some Tylenol 3 (+ C) and bring it back to the U.S.? Are there permits or announcements I need to make to CBP?

Tl;Dr Rare surgery problems, painkillers bye bye, assistance in sourcing more legally but with barriers, what do?

Edit: I'm really just asking because I feel like my asking my doctor would make them entirely hesitant (though they know of my condition,) and the laws and mandates on bringing medicines (especially OTC) into the U.S. from Canada is minimal and unhelpful at best. Really not trying to catch a felony for buying pain meds because my doctor might think I'm a drug seeker regardless of my physical well-being. ",1544086020.0

Anyways, I ended up paying about 80$ for two 40mg pandas and .4 of of some fire dope (seems like primarily dope dope no fent). In my parts this would normally be ~200-240$..so today was a good day. 

Hope y‚Äôall had a good day as well. JJ coming through ",1544075596.0

I did some math, if a person is prescribed 4 30s a day that's 120 pills, times 30 is $3,600 fucking dollars!! That's much more than i even make in a month. Even if they sell them at 20 bucks a pop they can literally live off of that in most US areas.

a3ksky,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a3ksky/so_i_saw_a_new_suboxone_doctor_today_and_was/,18,https://redd.it/a3ksky,VaporSaltyCaper,So I saw a new Suboxone doctor today and was denied a prescription for Suboxone.,"But I was kind of caught off guard by the doctor‚Äôs reasoning for denying me the script. After signing all of the required agreements to receive the RX (2 hours into the appointment) I was told that I could not get the Suboxone script due to the fact that I am prescribed Adderall (30mg 2X Daily) by my regular psychiatrist that I‚Äôve been seeing regularly since early 2004.  Now I wasn‚Äôt really sure what to expect walking into this appointment this morning but I certainly would‚Äôve never guessed that my Adderall script would be the reason for being rejected a Suboxone script. 

The doctor explained how she felt Adderall was a ‚Äúvery dangerous drug‚Äù and refused to script Suboxone unless she would have the opportunity to consult with my psychiatrist AND I agreed to discontinue Adderall and be willing to try a different (non stimulant) drug. So again this came as a huge surprise to me and I figured if anything might present a problem (or reason for the Dr. to deny a Sub script) it would most certainly be Benzos or to a lesser extent my positive UA result for weed. I had received a 30 day script of Xanax (1mg) about 2 months ago from my regular psychiatrist which I had intended to use towards the end of my Suboxone taper. I still have that entire script sealed and locked away and I was forthcoming regarding it being prescribed, filled, and still in my possession.  I guess I just figured if anything that would be the issue to come up and prevent me from getting a new script for Sub. So I guess I just feel like this doctor was just looking for something (anything really) to get me out of there empty handed.

So I just figured I‚Äôd share in this Sub and maybe get some feedback and/or advice going forward. I‚Äôd love to hear what you guys think and specifically:

1) Is Adderall really a harmful/dangerous drug that presents a significant risk (and potentially harmful drug interaction) to the opiate dependent user? I‚Äôve been prescribed and using  regularly both Adderall & Suboxone for several years. If it did indeed present such a dangerous and risky drug interaction, why would my previous Sub doctor and psychiatrist allow me to continue on this combo? I don‚Äôt necessarily reject this doctor‚Äôs reasoning outright. Perhaps she‚Äôs right and it‚Äôs not the the safest combination of drugs but this is what‚Äôs been working for me and prescribed to me for years. 

In any event I just kind of feel like this doctor could‚Äôve saved us both a lot of time had they simply refused to prescribe Sub alongside Adderall. Why schedule me for the appointment,  have me submit the UA, paperwork, medical background/details, etc. etc. if you know from the jump you won‚Äôt script any patient using Adderall?

2)And I guess my more pressing concern is where do I go from here? I suppose I will just continue to seek out another Sub doctor (I have about 25-30 2mg strips remaining) however the doctor I met with today did give me a referral to an extremely expensive pain management specialist and suggested that I get in touch with that person to assist me with Suboxone maintenance and/or perhaps treating with a different opiate.  Anyway yeah sorry for the Adderall fueled rant/ramble!!!! Lol Thanks again everyone and hope you all are having  a relaxing and pleasant evening!!!",1544072734.0

I‚Äôd been hustling every day to support our habits and try and fend off the debt he was getting from payday advancements. I sold panties, all my things, and drove my dealers around just to keep us both right. At some point our relationship turned toxic. I‚Äôd been self medicating my crippling depression, and he just wanted to keep his high going. Arguments about the drugs happened often and I grew to resent him. He‚Äôd gaslight me and then turn sickly clingy, giving me whiplash. 

I started working for two dealers who lived together and were doing well, one I was friends with from previous business. One night after driving them around, they gave me china to try. Over the course of that night, he had stolen most of what I brought home. We fought and he told me I have no reason to be mad.

He also had contacted my parents and told them I was the one solely doing drugs. My father ended up taking a bus and driving me home.

2. What does it feel like to be on your drug of choice? 

3. How much does it typically cost?

4. How much work goes into acquiring it?

5. Do you think you would be capable of quitting if you focused all your time and energy into it?

6. And finally, if you could go back in time and stop yourself from trying it, would you?

Meanwhile, everyone else is sitting there in their car waiting to be served.

Not only are we committing felonies so it's best not to be in the area longer than we need to but everyone else is fucking going through it too. The dude who spends 3 minutes talking to the dealer is always the one who is just salivating when he pulls ups. It's like all the withdrawal he was just in goes away as soon as he sees that car, and he just talks and talks. Almost like he's getting pleasure of making everyone else wait while he has what he needs.

I've also had this happen to me when I'm with someone who is a talker. They'll be jonesing like no tomorrow pawning off their last possessions, but they'll sit there and talk to the dealer after we're served instead of leaving right away to get right like we should be doing. 

Anyway, this just happened to me. Was meeting the dude, I was the first person there, but the third guy there jumped out of his car and ran over to the dealers car as soon as he pulled up and just stood outside dude's window talking BS with the shit in his hands, while he could see the rest of us waiting our turn. ughhh

I started taking opiates as a bet at a job. I had been drinking for awhile when this ""bet came about"". Weed and psychs was not my thing. I was bet that I could not get |x| amount of work done in what was the allotted time if I took one of (employees) meds. At this point I was ignorant, and laughed and said hell yea $10. The bet then went to 2 and I still said fine. I ended up taking ""had no reference at the time"" 2 30mg oxycodone (I know people will say no one would give this away, but at this time it was sooooo cheap and it was to make fun of me when it hit)

&#x200B;

   All of this was only irrelevant for about 15 minutes when I was working in a bay by myself. There are not words that can explain what happened over a maybe 2 or 3 minute period. I was concerned, amused, and then floored as far as emotions go. I felt absolutely invulnerable, I was alone in the bay for a good 45 minutes and was stuck with my thoughts about this while i was working. Saying that it was amazing is an understatement.

&#x200B;

I got my work done and went back to laugh at a joke meant to blow up in my face. Here is where I finished out the day and went home without much fanfare except for to tell the dude he did the exact opposite of what was intended (I have to interject here too and say that he may well have been smart to think hey, ""I cant totally hook this kid and it will be a cakewalk. But this guy blew me off for over 2 months after this....hell maybe it was a long play.""

&#x200B;

  Back to the day it all happened. I go home and swipe one of my dads beers from the basement and go put on some music to chill with because I am still feeling awesome +3 hours later. I drink maybe a 1/3 of the beer in one gulp and sit down. Not 5 minutes goes by and I am running for the bathroom to throw up. I was in zero pain but it was coming out...and I really could not have cared less. I was fine and my stomach was immediately settled. The rest of the night was cool and I just refrained from drinking and still felt pretty fuckin bulletproof for most of the night.

  A few months later and I end up asking this dude for pills because I am hungover as fuck and he gives me 1. I should have been afraid that I would throw up again but I guess I wasn't thinking. I was fine, The exact same thing happened as the first time! I was money the rest of the day. This is where things start to turn.

&#x200B;

   this was my first experience with opiates. I have not had them in about 17 months after over a decade of ""daily if possible"" usage. It is very interesting how people end up in a particular situation, could be a complete shot in the dark....or they were destined to come upon it someday.....who knows. ",1544028837.0

Drove a good distance to meet my middleman, who I was planning on buying 7 30‚Äôs from. Ended up waiting for a long time in the parking lot like usual, but eventually she texted me saying she was coming with her boyfriend and to look for a black truck.

She said how she was in a hurry and whatnot so I was getting a little weird about the whole thing but I‚Äôve copped through her plenty of times and more or less was ready to just get home (which is 2 hours away, long I know, but I live out in the middle of nowhere so I‚Äôm used to it)

Around 9pm or so I see the truck pull up, and I step out of my car ready to jump in the backseat of the truck and finally cop. He pulls up with the window rolled down saying what‚Äôs up and that he has to go somewhere so we gotta make this quick. I literally could only think about the pills in his hands so I had my guard down and since I knew the girl I didn‚Äôt really think about it so I gave him the money and he gave me the pills which were wrapped up. I figured he would stay there for a sec to count the money and let me look at the pills but nope he just said bye and drove off

As soon as he left I realized what might of just happened and I ripped open the bag. Fucking vitamin B pills. Obviously I‚Äôm pretty upset but I mean shit happens so whatever. Drove home and had to explain to my gf where I had been.

Anyway, I know where they live, and now know what truck her bf drives. (First time id met him, I always just went through his gf)

Her bf has no idea I know where they live. I also know what day of the month she gets her 8mg a day Xanax script (that doc is crazy I know). 

I feel like I should just chalk this loss up and move on, but I feel betrayed and that was a good bit of money to lose. Plus I drove 2 fucking hours, and the week before I helped her out and gave her a ride to the dboy.

What do you guys l think I should do?

It‚Äôs embarrassing telling this story to me bc I feel like I should know better by now, but whatever I love this sub and read it all the time so I doubt y‚Äôall will judge me too harshly.

a3bv53,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a3bv53/gotta_love_the_justice_system/,10,https://redd.it/a3bv53,2ndwaveobserver,Gotta love the justice system,"So early last year, I got pulled over for not completing a stop at a stop sign. Small town cops look for any reason to stop people. The cop claims I‚Äôm drunk (which I wasn‚Äôt) and starts berating me for driving under the influence. In his mind, me being drunk also means I must have drugs on me for some reason so he proceeds to search without my permission. 

Eventually he finds an old straw that was used for snorting shit, which is old af because I haven‚Äôt snorted in a long time. Regardless though, there was some residue inside and he got all pumped up saying ‚Äúif there‚Äôs narcotics in this straw I‚Äôm sending it to the state‚Äù. Fucking pig. 

Well true to his word, a few months later I get a felony warrant for possession of heroin and fentanyl, all because of a tiny bit of residue that amounts to nothing more than paraphernalia. It‚Äôs total bullshit but I have to fight it. So I get a lawyer and pay him 3,500 bucks to fix this shit. 

After about a year of back and forth crap and several court dates later (which I didn‚Äôt have to attend) I get a call on Monday from my lawyer saying that the arresting officer no longer works at this department and they have no idea where he went. Which means there is no longer a case!! They‚Äôre banking on him obviously not showing up and getting a dismissal, but on the off chance he does show up, they‚Äôve already got a winning argument. His entire statement was centered around the fact that he believed me to be drunk but he never once did field sobriety test or gave me a breathalyzer, so his probable cause statement is null and void. Fucking idiot. I even asked him when he arrested me if he was going to test me and he got all pissed and got in my face cussing at me and what not.

I started to dabble in drugs when I was 18. I did everything except meth  pretty much but opiates were always my DoC. I was deep into it (had people shoot me up a few times but knew better to learn to do it myself). Finally when I was 23, my mom pleaded to me to get clean. I had hit rock bottom. I was behind on rent, bills, my car got towed and impounded, almost lost my job, dropped out of school, etc. You know the drill. I voluntarily checked into a public detox center for 3 days and then moved back out into the country with my parents and was clean for over 6 years. 

Fast forward to summer 2017. I have a house, a car, a husband, 2 kids. Life is fine, but my goddamn anxiety was eating me up. I was offered 2 perks and told myself I deserved this. I could handle this. My brain just needed a break. 

It wasn‚Äôt one time. I was euphoric. So I kept getting more. It made me a better parent, after all, I told myself. But pills got more pricey and I wasn‚Äôt even getting high off them anymore. So the last 2 months I‚Äôve been snorting heroin. Now, my rock bottom, might not be your rock bottom. But after I nodded off in a hammock for 3 hours in 30 degree temps and when I nodded off into a bowl of soup at dinner (thankfully I was alone with no family that day) I realized I needed to change. 

I kept telling myself I‚Äôd get one more fix to help taper myself down and eliminate most WD symptoms. That went on for awhile. 

Finally, for some reason, my one and only plug didn‚Äôt respond one day. By that point I was in full blown withdrawal. I knew it was now or never. I first blocked and then deleted his number from my phone. I got all my shifts covered for 9 days. I started researching withdrawal symptoms and lurking on reddit. 

I had gone through all this before but it had been 6 years since I‚Äôve experienced this and knowing what to expect helped.

So, I was bed ridden for 3 days while my husband cared for our children. It was hell. Fever and chills, sweats, my dilated eyes HURT, eveything smelled so bad, restless legs, anxiety was eating me alive. I didn‚Äôt sleep for 3 days and on day 4 I slept for 2. I took 4 showers a day. I smoked copious amounts of weed to get through it (does it count as cold turkey then) and took valerian root. My GI issues and night sweats are still present but I feel much better.  I ordered some CBD Oil and it‚Äôs been a miracle for my PAWS symptoms, especially anxiety which is always my trigger. 

Now, I was doing drugs on my own. I didn‚Äôt have to cut any friends out of my life. I only had the one plug.  So, a bit easier for me in that regard. 

Anyway, I see a lot of people struggling in here and I just wanted to post my recovery story. I can‚Äôt deal with NA meetings because I have a mild case of agoraphobia and I don‚Äôt need to surround myself with people that have potential hook ups to new dealers. These online communities have helped me a lot, reaching out without physically doing so. Anyway, just want everyone to know that recovery is possible. It‚Äôs hard ass work but it‚Äôs worth it. 

If anyone needs support or just someone to talk to while beginning their journey into sobriety, I‚Äôm here for you.

I will always love opiates, but there‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúone last time.‚Äù ",1544010503.0

I‚Äôve never sorted and never will and same with needles so swallowing only.

This would only be a once off curiosity thing so should I go with 40mg so it‚Äôs worth it?

Discuss","Okay so I made a post yesterday about jumping off a fairly large morphine habit (300mg a day) and hopefully switching on to kratom. Well I'm currently at hour 21 since my last dose and have been taking 10grams of kratom every 4 hours and it's barely holding me. I'm currently going through bouts of hot and cold flashes, extreme fatigue, sweating, anxiety and dysphoria but I'm not quite in full wds so that kratom is def helping a little. 


Now I'm a chronic pain patient so the just sweat it out for a week to get my life back isn't an option because I need to work at the pain gradually reducing dosages of whatever pain meds while increasing healthy activities like exercise etc. Anyways I'm getting sicker by the hour, I have lots of morphine but I'm really trying not to use. (I know stupid to keep it around I just dont know if I'll need it til i can get to a doctor) So anyways I have a friend dropping in some subs to me tomorrow. I have about 10 days to get shot right before going back to work. By that time I have to be stable and I dont want to be stable on morphine/oxy because that shit is destroying me and my non existent money. 


So my options are as follows- I can grab my kratom and head up to the country to my dads and just sweat this out until I stabilize on kratom. I can take the subs and kratom together this addressing both the addiction ad pain element of my problem. In terms of what's going to be easiest and less pain as well as possibly what'll keep me off the harder stuff long term the combo seems like the go. But I'm terrified of becoming even more dependent on subs and then I still have to get off those down the track which seems like even more of a nightmare. I can get a script for subs that's np. I know everyone's different but what strat do you guys think my best ling term outlook is for this? Basically I need something for my pain and I need to somehow not use while also being able to slowly reduce dosages of whatever I'm on as I work to cure my chronic pain with as few debilitating side effects as possible. This is all new ground to me as i dont have much experience with kratom or subs though I'm well versed in opiates in general, so any advice is appreciated. ",1544005289.0

My Journey and Advice so Far:
Today I discharged from a recovery center for detox. I spent 5 days in there, where I was surrounded by medical care and others going through detox, whether it was for alcohol or drugs. THIS WAS THE BEST THING POSSIBLE!!!
During the day, I had group meetings and was given meds to ease withdrawal and basically stabilize me. This is NOT recovery, simply stabilization and that is where you need to START.

Tomorrow, I start my PHP (partial hospitalization program) where I go for 5 days a week, about 5 hours a day of group/one on one therapy, and this will be for about 4 weeks. I will also be going to NA meetings and following the 12 step program. If you think that program is bullshit, you‚Äôre wrong. Accept the fact you can‚Äôt change things on your own, and have the courage to change the things that you can. Serenity is where it‚Äôs at.

It doesn't impact me terribly, but in essentially makes my hands shake/tremble, and it has gotten more pronounced as I get older. It's exacerbated if I haven't eaten, or if I take any stimulants (I'm prescribed Adderall for ADHD). Ironically, the shaking gets worse if I am concentrating and trying to keep my hands still to do something involving fine motor control.

As you can imagine, this can make hitting a vein absolute hell, and it's ridiculously hard to keep a needle steady in my vein and depress the plunger. Even worse, sometimes I shake when I get excited. You can't imagine how maddening it is to be sick as hell, make a bigass shot, poke around for 20 minutes, and then get so excited when I finally register that I accidentally jerk the needle straight out of my arm. I've also helplessly watched as my shaking hands spilled my dose all over the floor. I once diligently and responsibly managed to save a large wakeup shot I had spent 5 hours laying in bed thinking about, only to spill the entire thing on the carpet. The feeling of depression and self-loathing as I cried and tried to draw it up out of my dirty carpet still feels raw today.

There's no real point to this post, I just felt like whining, and this isn't really a problem I can talk about anywhere else, since the general public is remarkably unsympathetic in regards to my challenges with successfully injecting drugs into my veins.

On a side note, does anyone else get shaky when they're dopesick? I find that I shake like an alcoholic going through withdrawal when I'm detoxing, and that when I'm high/well it goes away. Am I alone, or is this a normal thing?

I've followed all the how tos. I always try after a shit,  but still nothing. Yes i know just because i just went doesn't mean I'm all the way clear. But are you telling me that all the people who suggest this are 100% clear all the time? 

I just tried it again with H. I used as much as i would do in a line, even though the how to said do half of that. 

I tried with dills several times once doing 40mgs at once. I barley felt anything that time and  it led me to go get h for the first time in almost 5 years. 

The directions are simple. Why does it not work for me? ",1543962056.0
