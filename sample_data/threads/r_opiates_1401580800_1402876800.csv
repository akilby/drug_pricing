There was dried blood in it so I drew up ethyl alcohol solution a couple times and cleaned it out. Then I drew up water to rinse it out a couple times. Then i drew up the dope and shot myself up with it. I was wondering if what I did was dangerous and if I can catch any sort of disease or bacteria? It was my own dried blood in there but the dried blood was all cleared out after rinsing the rig with the ethyl alcohol solution. Anyone know if i'm good or if I should now go to the doctor.

So I know Percs are opiates + tylenol. If opiates don't work, what are my other options? Is it uncommon for them to not work for pain? Would a stronger opiate, like Vicodin, work better? 

Note, I have a chronic pain condition which might be due to my pain signals being on a hare trigger (in theory, says my doc). So I think that might have something to do with it, because I don't feel like anything ever works for pain management... 

I'm not looking for long-term use at ALL (and don't care about getting high) just something I can take to manage pain for two or three hours when my condition flares up (maybe twice a month). Dr isn't any help so I am doing my own research.

I plan on making a foray back into actual, non-regular opiate again, I think. I'll give you guys a quick breakdown of my history before I ask my questions:

* Former IV heroin user, 4-6 times/week. I've never IV'd a pill before, though I did insulfate oxymorphone a few times a month when I could get my hands on it back then.

* I've been off of heroin for 530 days, as of today

* I haven't used any IV for that time, but I have done some small-time shit like a few oxy 5s, some norcos and vikes, tramadol (sparingly), and a few nights of IR morphine. I've only done those things a handful of times since I got off of dope. I also currently use kratom a few times a week. 

Now, I have been itching for some damn rush recently. I am also subject to Redwood Labs normal 10(?) panel test. I don't think that hydromorphone will show up on a normal opiate screen by RTL, so that's my choice. 

I've some Mallinckrodt 8mg pills coming to me soon. I am excited, but I want to do it right, so I thought I'd come here and ask a few questions to an experienced community that I trust.

* Dose? I'm thinking 4mg (half a pill). [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/26l8kt/dilaudid_no_tolerance/) is what made me decide that. I think that it sounds perfectly reasonable. I want the rush, but I want the high to have some legs. Since I've no tolerance, this should be fine, right? I don't think much higher would be fun.

* I've never prepped a pill for IV use before. That being said, from what I understand, the Mallinckrodt pills are pretty easily cooked, and a cotton filter should deal with most of the shit I don't want in my shot. Is this true? I've googled for a good prep guide, but I can't find one really. If anyone has any tips or tricks here, or if you can point me to a good guide, that'd be great.

* Where should I inject? I feel super comfortable with the crook of my left arm. My veins are in great shape currently, but I have to wear a short sleeve shirt for work. I work with people that'd know what's up the minute they saw any sort of redness, bruising, or irritation in the crook of my arm. I was thinking feet, but I've never done that before. Pretty much anywhere on my arm is out. If anyone has any suggestions there, that'd be great.

* How should I prepare myself for my dose? I know I'm going to get super itchy, so I plan on taking a few Benadryl. Any other suggestions for ways to prepare myself for the dose?

Anyway, I think those are all the questions that I have currently.

Thanks in advance for your help and advice.

You have been awake all night, unable to sit still because the feeling of centipedes crawling inside your bones is the first thing that happens. The sun starts to rise and you try to desperately distract yourself until 9, the magic number. You’ve grown to hate dawn, the way the blue morning light creeps into the window of your apartment that really needs to be clean…once you aren’t dope sick.


9 is the earliest these assholes will answer their phones. Your thumb is on autopilot, going down your most frequent calls, in order from the dealers with the best to worst dope. 


“You have reached the voicemail of-""  Redial.


Sometimes you make yourself wait for 4 or 5 minutes before resuming wasting your minutes. Your phone isn’t even against your ear, you can hear that automated answering machine since everything is painfully loud, and the morning light is painfully bright when you’re sick. 


After who knows how many times, you’ve never once looked at your phone to see how many calls you actually make, your stomach churns when it connects and starts to dial instead of going straight to voicemail. After 30 minutes, 4 hours, 10 seconds, it’s different every day.


“Are you on?” you have a script, the way you have a script if you were at work talking to a customer on the phone. You’re already halfway out the door before they even say yes, they tell you to call when you get over to north Minneapolis. 


They stop answering by the time you reach the earliest exit into the neighborhood, and you realized you probably should have been charging your phone the entire time you were trying to get ahold of anyone. A shittier dealer is, of course, on by this point, and you take the exit and resume your script even though it’s an entirely different outfit. They still understand.


“I’m over north, where do you want me to go?” they mumble something, expecting you to make it out over the screaming children, the party that never ended last night, the fight with one of their side girls, or the blaring rap music. 


“What?” you understand 3 syllables out of 20. “Bryant?” you try, wincing, hoping he doesn’t hang up. He just screams, which is comforting at this point. He could have hung up. 


“Oh, Vincent,” you say the street. “Sorry, Vincent and what?” you hold the phone away from your ear when he perfectly enunciates a string of insults and threats. “Vincent and 27th?” he hangs up. You’re only about 15% sure that’s where he wants you to go, but you don’t dare call back.


You stare at your dash, deciding you’re sick of this shit, trying the dealers from before who still aren’t answering, deciding you’re going to wait anyway because fuck that. 


“You have reached the voicemail of-“ Redial.

Less than a minute later, you’re heading to 27th and Vincent anyway for your shitty dope. You call when you get there and they don’t answer, of course. Your battery is low, of course. You wonder if they do this on purpose, if it’s a game to them. How much can you take? Why is it so hard to deliver these people the hundreds of dollars you manage to scrape up every day? When will you give up?

They know you can’t give up. 

Don, your main number (assigned stupid nicknames by you and the people you pick up with because of course that’s not their real name), has you waiting for maybe 15 minutes, maybe 3 hours. Your truck has no A/C or heat, but you sit, hoping for the best…but always, always expecting the worst. 


“I’m pulling up right now,” lies. You know it’s a lie but you crane your neck and your saucer sized eyes still scrutinize every passing car or pedestrian who may have your heroin. You get mad at them for not telling the truth, despite the fact you’re a chronic liar yourself. 


“Where you at?” they ask when you call, giving them an hour and a half sitting at the same intersection where all the houses have signs in the yard saying WE WATCH, WE CALL. 


“Still at 27th and Vincent.”


“Go to Dupont and 52nd,” he says. You swear, not caring if the call ended first and he heard it, putting your truck in gear as fast as possible, wondering how many different intersections he’ll make you drive to before he actually meets you. You don’t want to think about the possibility of him not, it makes your skin crawl worse than the withdrawal actually is. 


When you get to 52nd and Dupont, there is no 52nd and Dupont. The road stops, it’s a school, a park,  or a dead end. You call to tell them and they tell you you’re an idiot and act like it’s your fault they gave you an intersection off the top of their head that doesn’t exist. They tell you it’s gonna be another half hour. A half hour when you’re dopesick is a month.


And you’re really sick now. If you weren’t a worthless drug addict and had a job, if you didn’t know this sickness intimately and feel it every day, if you were a normal functioning person and woke up feeling the way you felt, you would call in sick. When you actually do have a job it's even worse.


“You have reached the voicemail of-“

They wouldn’t be able to get out of bed. You don’t really want to either, but the knowledge that you can do something to make it all go away is too powerful of a force. You know it will all go away, if you try hard enough. 


You finally get your bag, the one you went to 4 intersections for and waited 2 hours for. You pull over and do your shot and the second you sit back in your seat waiting for the sickness to go away, your number one choice in dealers calls you to tell you they are on. One of their bags would have actually gotten you high, instead of functional, but you just handed your money over. 


You stare at the dashboard for too long and swear you’re going to quit. You can’t take it anymore, every day, multiple times a day. 


You forget this promise the next morning when you’re sitting in the CVS parking lot, waiting for someone else. How did you get the money?  You don’t remember anymore, it’s all a blur. Your brain is always trying to solve the constant puzzle of where the money is going to come from, it’s always working. You’re always too focused on your 5 concurrent plans to get more money to focus on how you got whatever is in your hand.


The general rule that you made up is that you wait ten minutes after they said they were going to be face to face with you to call. If you call too much, they get mad. You wait an extra 5 minutes before calling because you’re so terrified of not being served, but they get mad at you for calling anyway. 


Everything makes them mad, because they hate you. You’re no different from the dozens of other people calling, just as sick, just as frantic, just as pathetic. 


“Turn yo car off.”


“I told you not to park on the corner,” these reasons are always made up and sometimes make no sense, he’s close enough to your face that you get covered in his grape swisher flavored spit. 


The Girls, another stupid nickname for another number, spend ten minutes explaining to you that 27th is in-between 26th and 28th when you park in a spot they don’t like. You just nod and say sorry. 

3 hours pass, you look at the other cars obviously waiting and wonder why they are always white boys with backwards baseball caps. I mean, they aren’t always probably, but your memory can’t come up with anything else. You look at the WE WATCH, WE CALL signs, and briefly think of the fact that they’re on the lawns because of you and what you’re doing to keep yourself going. 


A train of seven cars follows a white SUV into an alleyway and your heart is about to explode both at the fact that you are so close to your drugs and how sketchy the situation is. You pray to a god you’ve never believed in that if he just lets you get out of this dumb, highly suspicious situation with your drugs in hand that you’ll stop. You never stop. 


You wait in the parking lot of Benihana for 2 hours, waiting for them to finish eating like they’re on a real time card and this is their lunch break.


Most of the numbers in your phone are all dealers, with stupid nicknames so you can refer to who you’re going to go through when you’re making plans with other people. Don, The Girls, Stax, North, Pete, Chicago, Northeast. Mike. Shorty. Even though you have all the numbers memorized at this point. Even when they change so often. 

“I have to go to work,” you call them after 2 hours one time and lie, hoping it will make them come faster. It doesn't.

“I’ll be there in 5 minutes,” they say automatically, and go back to their blunts and xboxes. You think about what bad businessmen they are and fume, but the dope gets away of anger.

Only one number is on, but they won’t answer. You’re so frantic this time that you knock on your neighbor’s door and try to borrow someone’s phone to see if the dealer is avoiding you specifically, or just not picking up at all. Your U of M neighbor who did coke one time at a party and thought it was edgy has no idea that the last call made on his phone is one of the largest heroin syndicates in Minneapolis when you hand it back to him with no luck. Your neighbor goes back to his own blunt and xbox. 

You meet Stax, you don’t remember how, some girl that you talked to one time while you were both waiting for Don or maybe an old friend you used with once or maybe he had your number from someone else’s phone. Stax has a knit cap with an embroidered stack of hundreds and the word “STAX.” He’s polite as can be, never more than five minutes late, and is honest and fixes his fuck ups. He pocket dials you once and you hear him tell a girl that he’s taking “brain pills” for his sadness. He is your main dealer for 5 weeks before he gets sent to prison. 

Back to Benihana. 

“You have reached the voicemail of-“

Every black guy who walks by could have your heroin. It’s SO racist, it makes you look so racist in this awful city, but the runners these people have are always new and you never know and if you miss them walking or driving by you risk losing your chance to get well. Every car that goes by makes you hold your breath, you stare down everyone who is walking by through the side mirrors in your car. Sometimes groups of people who know why you’re waiting in a car bang on the windows and try to harass you. You learned to keep the windows up after they tried to pull you out of the window by your hair once.

Cumin powder, vitamins, and even rocks you've been given before.

“You have reached the voicemail of-“ you hear it so many times, you really start to hate that bitch and direct all your anger toward that stupid recording. It takes hours to get a bag and you wonder if this is payback for years of racism. You deserve it, but it doesn’t make it any easier. 

If you’re a girl and it’s late, they might give you 2 bags instead of 1 and then ask for head. When you nervously say you only want one, they threaten your life. You know reasonably that it would be so stupid for them to rape or kill you and risk their entire operation going down, but of course you don’t feel safe. 

One guy makes you stop at the corner store to get sandwich bags and grape blunts. They get in your car like they sometimes do when they’re on foot and ask you to drive as they open the sock they carry their cargo in.

“Make a left,” he says when you’re halfway through the intersection. After he gives you the bag and you put it in your mouth for safekeeping, you ask him if he wants to get out here, willing with ever iota of your existence for him to go away so you can drive 2 blocks away and tear open the plastic in your mouth, but he makes you drive around for 5 minutes. Maybe because he knows, or maybe because he thinks it’s less suspicious looking, even though it’s always fucking suspicious looking. You do your dope in the car, using melted snow as the water to cook it in, knowing how stupid it is but not caring after all the trouble you went through. 

Even though 9 is the magic number, mostly, there are always those days where they call  you at 8am when you haven’t even figured out how the hell you’re going to get money for the day. When you finally scrape together some money, they’re off by 2pm. Other days, when you’ve had your money since the night before, they turn on at noon. 

“You have reached the voicemail of-“ 

Redial.  

“You have reached the voicemail of-“ you did not miss this bitch, but you keep coming back.

“Come to the barber shop,” you wonder why the cops don’t realize all the barber shops in Minneapolis are drug fronts. You shout into your phone as it’s about to die to “Mike” that you are positive you are on Chicago and 16th because you have been standing at the intersection for half an hour staring at the signs. 

“My bad,” he says finally and makes you walk a block to where he is. He hands you a gum wrapper that you should look into to make sure both of the bags you bought are there because it’s not like he hasn’t ripped you off before, but you just don’t care. They all rip you off occasionally, they know they can for a while. You’ll always come back to them.

Sometimes you rip them off too, a couple dollars to you as a junkie for cigarettes or gas money is invaluable. Mostly they don’t care, but sometimes business relationships are terminated over 3 dollars. You run into the coffee shop you work at because a dealer just turned you down for being eight dollars short and go into the back, making up a story about losing an iPod that you would never have because you would have pawned it, and take a roll of quarters from the back, running back to the truck to go back over north.

I recently posted something similar to this on r/crohnsdisease, but it occurred to me I'd probably get some better answers here. 

I started using low-dose Vicodin prescribed by my GI around five years ago now. It helped my pain, kept me regular, and even let me eat without fear of stomach pain. Eventually, as my opiate tolerance increased, I had to take more and more Vicodin - until I moved to oxycodone, then morphine, then dilaudid, and now, finally, fentanyl. I've managed to stop taking narcotics once during this time, but only with the help of Suboxone (a narcotic in itself). Currently, I'm using 150mcg/h fentanyl patches, changed every 72 hours (when they actually last that long, which is rare).

I'm about to the point where my pain may be under control enough for me to get off the narcotics again, and I'd love to be rid of them. However, I can't go through those withdrawals again - combined with my Crohn's symptoms, I've never felt anything half as awful as opiate withdrawal. The WD symptoms stack with my normal symptoms and I'm in living hell - so I'm hoping to hear some new tricks for battling withdrawals that I'm not familiar with already.

Suboxone probably isn't an option; my insurance won't cover it, and I'm too broke to afford it. I've had some amount of success in the past using Kratom tea to help lessen WDs, although it's no cure. I've heard that marijuana might help, but I've got no way to acquire any - if it really helps that much, let me know and I'll try to get some somehow.

My doctor is very understanding, and if I come to him with some ideas of things to try he'll likely give them to me. So, what do I use to fight withdrawals from a couple-year-long huge fentanyl habit?

That somebody did their very best to give them all the best harm reduction information they could, but you just can't fix stupid. They even tried to shy them away saying look this will fuck you up seriously. They insisted on buying half a bundle because ""you don't know me any more. You don't know what I'm capable of and what I can and can't do"". That somebody should have turned around and said oops I'm out and blocked the number. 

When the deal went down they made sure they knew what they were getting into and drew parallels to common media such as trainspotting. ""Oh so this stuff is pretty much orgasmic then?"". ""Yes and very fucking deadly if you don't know what you're doing and you're also purchasing a fucking lot of it"". Whatever. They thought the one bag that had 5 tiny stamps in it was just one and insisted for their other 4. That somebody should have just returned the money and said get the fuck out of their house. But they instead decided to inform them. They would rather try to teach proper harm reduction and know they're safe rather than have them (oh so determinedly) do something from the streets and fuck up worse. 

A day later the dude gets a call at 6am from the person who bought sobbing incoherently. Then a series of texts ""that shit I bought caused my friend to OD. He did the whole bag"". ""That is spiked heroin. Morphine is an upper"". ""I'm watching him breathe the entire night"". The person completely disregarded the multitude of times they were told. ""Tiny small bumps, like grain of rice size. You can always do more if you aren't high enough but you can never undo what you've already consumed"". Did they filter that as ""you can ALWAYS DO MORE!""?!? Where in the flying fuck did they get that opiates were an upper?!? Who the fuck was ripping them off on morphine?!? Needless to say that somebody was fucking confused and very angry. They got a FaceTime of some dude nodded out on the couch snoring with their former friend crying in the background. Yes let's all do a bunch of benzos and Mia Wallace lines!!

Lucky enough nobody dies in this story. A friendship and a monetary opportunity did though and just telling this story is enough to make me and that somebody just furious. He did everything in his power besides refusing them to inform them and reduce harm and yet not a single word was listened to or followed. They didn't avoid mixing with other downers, they didn't follow the suggested doses for their first time, they didn't even pay attention to the fact he said like trainspotting this shit WILL seriously fuck you up if you're not careful and yet somehow they have the audacity to accuse spiked tainted heroin and their dealer for their stupidity?!? Thank fuck no 5-0 got involved. Not to mention any injury was avoided. I guess that moron probably has a new respect for drugs and life which I guess can be a pro of this whole ordeal. 

Lessons learned: you can't stop stupid no matter how hard you try to. That and my buddy learned how valuable Xanax can be when he is so furious he could strangle somebody through the phone with his mind.

276plr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/276plr/in_iop_program_this_girl_is_so_beautiful_and/,6,https://redd.it/276plr,jazzyjizzle12,"in IOP program, this girl is so beautiful and reminds me of my ex so much","I'm in IOP program right now, 9 hours+ a week and to be honest I have used opiates primarily as a crutch to not feel so lonely or to not care that I feel this way. I have a supportive family but general circumstances and my own feelings like I need to prove myself as some kind of player or whatever nonsense have helped me stutter step my way into actually have real relationships with girls besides convenience sex and without strong emotional connection.

To be honest- I feel like the only way I could ever enjoy a clean life is if I found a girl I could feel really close with- I have a lot of empathy for people of all walks of life and things is hyper-judgmental to assume anyone is a ""bad"" person because none of us have walked in everyones shoes. I met this girl today in my IOP that of course first caught my eye because she is so very strikingly beautiful- but she also seems very intelligent and emotionally aware. I don't really think this is the right forum for this kind of question per-say, but it is in the context of an opiate detox methodology and I think generally speaking we are all part of a crowd that is just a little bit different than the rest (not in a good or bad way necessarily). I know emotions tend to run heavy when we detox but I honestly just want any advice people can give me on relationships through these ""rehab""y sort of mediums so I don't act silly or make an idiot of myself, however I really respect this girl and feel like I want to find some way to have a good excuse for talking to her outside of just the IOP. Can anyone help me with my game here? For all I really know she's crazier than me but so far I feel like I want to give a go at real life and the only thing that would make that meaningful is a relationship with someone that actually meant something to me. 

At the same time- the last thing I want to do is make her own treatment awkward or weird in generally because I lay some come ons at her that aren't well received. My general thought is that I will be seeing a lot of her and everyone else so I should just treat this as recovery and think of anything like that as a second fringe benefit if it ever even comes up but she is just so fucking gorgeous and seems so cool. Am I an idiot for thinking like this? She looks a lot like my ex from college which is the last girl I really cared about and I know that is fucking with my head a lot but I feel like I want to find some way to try this without seeming like a total dbag or influencing her recovery in a bad way either.

I barely know anything about her at all to be honest but I'm drunk now and thought I'd make this post so yall here could talk some sense at me or point me in the right direction. To be clear- I am not looking for easy poontang (thought shit that would be great too but not at the cost of a potential good relationship) but instead a relationship of substance which is something I just really have almost no experience with so I don't know do I like try to ask her to talk to me over a cup of coffee or what? I want the whole range of opinions on this sort of thing so please don't hold back I just have been getting a wave of emotions on these matters and figure you all are probably the best to ask.",1401783115.0

I also get shit consistently in town that is just as good if not better then the best stuff my buddy could find for recreational purchase in Denver.

I scored this morning and about a half hour ago took a nice fat satisfying shot, lay on my bed listening to Jesu on headphones and just let if wash over me feeling better than I have in months and this though popped into my head: I wish I had someone to share this with.


See, I'm a chipper; I smoke 2 or 3 days a week max and shoot maybe once or twice a month (3 max) and despite about a decade of abusing the shit out of ludicrous doses of Codeine and Dihydrocodeine and about 8 months of (very) gradually increasing chipping, I still often go a week, maybe two without any withdrawal symptoms.


Don't get me wrong, I realise this is *absolutely* not sustainable and I've been a couple times to a recovery place and we're currently drawing up a kind of life-plan thing and setting up counselling to ease me off the smack before it's too late, but right now I'm still in that brief but fucking fantastic phase where the good vastly outweighs the bad.


And here's the thing, although I am absolutely an addict myself, I have a few friends who occasionally indulge in drugs and aren't addicts.
I have one friend in particular who has fucking unbelievable self control and can literally do, say, MDMA just the once and then not even consider doing it again for another year.


When we used to smoke weed a lot I'd always give him the stuff to hold because if I have drugs, even if I'm just sitting around by myself with essays to write or I know I have work in the morning, I will *absolutely* do them. All of them. Right away.
This guy though, I have literally left an eighth of coke with him for weeks and he never once touched it, mawfucker actually *forgot* he had it.


So I guess what I am getting at is, although for maybe 90% of the people i know I wouldn't ever dream of recommending serious opiates, there are a handful of people who I kind of wish I could be like, ""Hey dude so here's the thing, don't freak out, but I do Heroin."" pause for mild freak out and whatthefucks, ""Okay, but it is totally amazing and remember how I talked you into doing MDMA, how I said it was incredible and you should just do it one time and you did and loved it and didn't stop thanking me and then you moved on with your life and never felt the need to do it again? Well this can be like that, right? I reckon you'd enjoy it, maybe give it a thought""


I'd never do it though, partly because I love this guy so much and mostly because, as much of an iron-willed fucking hero as he is, I still worry he'd get a taste because imo smack really is *that* good.


So yeah, I know most of you are in way, way worse situations than a fucking tourist like me, but are there any circumstances where you'd recommend doing Oxy or H or even just, like, a coupld Percs of Vicss or something, or would you never dream of it and totally steer everyone away no matter what?

**I appreciate that people here might take significantly more than I do, I'm not very big and hadn't touched opiates much in the first place.** - Context is everything.

I took a good amount, like up at the LD50 area **over the course of a few hours** (say 600-700mg).

It induced a 2-day+ seratonin syndrome where I just lay in bed for almost 72 hours, with the worst headache I've ever experienced and spewed several times (and the headache lasted the entire time I was conscious during those days). 


Didn't really consider how potentially fatal it could have been at the time, especially considering that I mixed it with anti-depressants (SSRIs). I know it's in the past but I never thought about it again until this morning, I've googled about but what do you guys think? Anybody with experience?

First Post :),"It's been a long time since I've bought the ticket and took the ride. That sweet lonely ride that inevitably leads to me being broke, desperate, and going through horrible WD'S. Its been nine months and 3 days since I been a full blown addict. The kind of low life junkie fucker that would sell his mom's soul for just one more good shot. One more time of nodding out listening to my favorite music. Just one fucking more...

I've came along way from who I was as to who I am now. I have been successfully chipping for the last seven months. Never using more than one or two days a week, but I can still feel that old demon lurking in the shadows. Every time I push that plunger down I can hear him say,""You shoulda bought more!!"" When I feel that slight restlessness the day after using. I can always hear him laughing at me. 

If it wasn't for meeting my now wife. I know I never would've made it this far. She has been the voice of reason for me since I met her. On most days I can hear her voice louder than ole ""Frederich Da Demon's"" voice. Sometimes though he is all I can hear. It took me the past months to realize that I can actually shut that ugly fucker up eventually, but he is still always going to be in the shadows. Lurking there with those glowing red eyes. Just waiting to sink his claws of addiction into my skinny white ass. 

So until the day comes where I know I have beat this fucking plague upon my life, and I know I can beat it. I will just keep playing my music, cooking some good grub, and making good memories with my wife.... Occasionally enjoying a good nod. ",1401858733.0

A year ago I moved down to Florida to escape the life I'd been living at home for more than a decade.  You see I come from a small town where everyone knows everybody.  In an attempt to break the constant cycle of use -> withdrawal -> PAWS -> relapse I moved in hopes of finding a new life.

It worked, for a few months.  Soon I had things I hadn't had in a long time.  Things like a steady job, plenty of money in my pocket, and a nice roof over my head with a loving family to come home to every day (moved in with my mother until I got settled).

But eventually through work I found new contacts.  Slowly at first but eventually I had a steady connect right around the block from my work.  Doing hard labor everyday, combined with the boredom of work and the demon inside was all the excuse I needed to start chipping again.

""Just a few on the weekend"" ah famous last words of a chipper.  But the opiates made the pain go away, and the anxiety, and these are certainly better for me that the hard liquor I'd been drinking every day after work.  Surely I can control things this time.

Eventually those few on the weekend turned into picking up every other day, sometime every day.  But I had money...well I HAD money.  The nice stack of 100's and 20's I had stashed away got smaller and smaller and eventually I realized I wouldn't be able to afford the car and apartment I was saving up for any time soon.

Eventually the holidays come around, and by Thanksgiving my habit had gotten back up to where I was going into W/Ds without a fix.  I ducked out of a house full of visiting family to ""pick up smokes"" at 9pm on a Saturday and drove into the city to cop some roxis to get well.

I think this set off alarms but I wasn't called out on it yet.  I got away with it for a while longer making sure to keep my pin-point pupils hidden, and my cut off straws were always tossed after a close call with the washing machine (forgot one was in my coin pocket).   I was a pro by this point and could hide it well.

But mother knows....

Christmas rolls around and I'm nearly broke.  So I worked as much overtime as possible to buy Christmas presents for the family members I was staying with.  A kindle for Mom, a Leatherman knife for my Step Father, and a nice wad of cash for my little 'sis.  Best Christmas I'd had in a long time.  Of course I managed to save up some extra for presents to myself (lots of oxys and opana).

By this point I'm a daily user again.  Staying up late so I could enjoy nodding without anyone seeing me and turning around to leave for work at 4am on little to no sleep.  People at work started to notice I was ""off"" and suspect I was using.  A loudmouth at my work place was friends with my step father and was reporting things back to him.   It wouldn't be long now.

Two weeks after Christmas on a Saturday morning the thing I feared happened.  I had quit a few days before in an attempt to clean out and stop spending so much cash on pills.  My mother wakes me up at 2pm in the afternoon and I hear the words I had dreaded since I started chipping so many months ago.

""Evennods, are you on pills again?""

Of course I denied it.  In a rage I yelled things I regret, things like her begin a horrible mother for not trusting me.  This led to a falling out between my step father and I.  Things were said in anger on all sides.  

It was all my fault...

I decided that I had to leave before I really ruined things between us.  I couldn't be trusted, hell I can't even trust myself.  I hopped the next flight I could catch home.  I had a valid excuse since I had a grandparent back home dying begging to see me one last time.  I ran with it, I ran back home.

Begin back home was nice and for awhile I did good.  I didn't use for months, opting for group tripping sessions with my old friends instead.  Much LSD, 2C-P, MDMA, and mushrooms were consumed in those few months.  I was trying to figure how where I was going in life now that I was again at a crossroads.  I learned a few things but eventually my use of those substances became purely for pleasure and I decided to stop.

At some point, I don't remember exactly when, I decided to buy some hydrocodone.  I just wanted one more nod, one more night where the pain went away and I could just forget about all my problems for awhile.

That was two months ago.  Since then I've picked up every other day like clock work.  It went from 20mg of hydro, up to 100mg of CWE hyrdro, to roxi 30s and eventually...H.

Heroin just kind fell into my lap.  After years of searching over two states it had finally found its way to me.  Wonderful off-white/tan ECP that is every bit as good as I dreamed it would be and then some.  I loved morphine so I knew I would love this stuff, and it lived up to the reputation.

So now I'm sitting here with a half-g that I rode 2 hours round trip to pick up.  It's a ride I'll take in a couple a days when the supply runs low and the demon within me needs to feed again.

But for now I don't think about that.  All I'm worried about is getting well and nodding while Adult Swim plays in the background.  Taking hits from the bong in between nods and popping open one eye to see the TV when I hear something interesting.  'Cause tonight I have my bag of H, my pack of smokes, a dime bag of weed and everything is going to be alright.",1401850149.0

(Wall of text following, sorry)","Alright, I'm 31, diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer last year. I'm currently on my second chemo regimen. I'm feeling pretty okay right now, but my tumor markers are starting to trend upwards, meaning I'll probably have to start something new soon. This cycle will probably continue until they run out of things to try. Statistically, people in my situation live about 29 months from diagnosis, 8-10% chance of living five years. I had a real bad time in December when I had a bone met in my sacrum which was just horrible. Fortunately, I had radiation treatment which took care of it, though it flared up for a few days about 2 months ago.

Right now, I'm not feeling any pain, though I'm taking 15 mg of methadone twice daily and about 12 mg hydromorphone daily. I don't get much of a buzz from the hydromorphone anymore, but it does alleviate my anxiety and helps with depression (not what it's for, I know). I get a total of 4 mg of hydromorphone IV when I go to chemo every other week, 2 mg at the start and 2 mg near the end. I do get a bit of a buzz from that, but nowhere near what I used to.

Obviously, since I'm in my situation, I can get whatever I want pretty much from my oncologist.

What I'd like to know is if anyone can give me any advice on enjoying my ability to get opiates relatively freely. Honestly, it's not like addiction can ruin my life, so I figure why not have fun with it? I guess what I want is some advice on how gradual I should step up my hydromorphone use. Like, would I be going too fast if I starting taking 20 mg of hydromorphone a day this month, then 30 in July, then 40 in August? Is that way too much?

I'm worried that if I start increasing, I'm going to eventually start acting spaced out all time. I can't do that to my mom. She's having such a hard time as is that I can't add that to her troubles.

If not the jist of the thread was that its costing me upwards of a grand a month for my fiance and I to continue suboxone maintenance, mostly due to the cost of medication. Our insurances suck.

The last time we were in her office the following happened.

My fiance missed out 8 mgs over a week span. We had to scrounge money up and continue to partially fill the script because we simply could not afford it. The doctor flipped shit and threatened to kick her out of the program for not taking her medication as prescribed. We asked about switching to a generic suboxone. She said no that there are no generics with both bupe and naloxone on the market.

she gave us these choices:

1. Fill the prescription by any means neccesary and take the medication **as prescribed** (no missing doses) or get kicked out of the program.

2. She would prescribe subutex, and in term its generic so that we could afford it. The stipulation here though was that we would have to drive to the pharmacy every day, pick up one days dose, drive to her office, and take it in front of her. Her reasoning behind this was that subutex is more abuse able than suboxone. This also wasn't feasible though.

3. Quit the program.

Tapering is not an option at this time, despite being told from the beginning that we could choose to taper off anytime we would like.

So I took everything she said into consideration and did some research to try to find different options hoping we could continue to afford this.

I foun.  3 Generic suboxones (both bupe and naloxone) printed them out to bring to her office.

I also looked up threads on people IV'ing subs from drugs-forum blue light, and opiophile. This was to show her that the naloxone did not make the suboxone any more tamper resistant than the subutex.

I also found and printed out the binding affinity of bupe and naloxone to further support my last concern.

*This did not go over well.*

First I showed her the generics. She flipped shit. At first she told me these are the exact same thing as suboxone so she couldn't comprehend why I would want them over the name brand suboxone films from RB. I told her my insurance will cover a generic a lot more than the name brand and this could be affordable to me. She then told me that she's the doctor not me and she knows all the medications that could be prescribed and these are not them. Not an option. Period.


I then told her that I would like the subutex but the driving there every day was not affordable or practical. I told her that suboxone is just as abuse able as subutex and showed her the printed threads and binding affinities to back up my claim. She exploded on me. She once again told me that she's the doctor not me and she's aware it can be abused, then proceeded to ask me if I knew the chemistry and everything of these drugs. I told her I did not and I didn't mean to try and come off as if I knew more than she did but I wanted to address her concerns of the subutex so this is what I came up with. She told me I must be so smart, that junkies are so smart and that's why we die of overdoses because we're so smart and know exactly what we're doing. I believe I deserved the first bit of that explosion, but most certainly not the last part.

She told me we're such pains in the ass. Every other patient comes in, takes there medication, and doesn't complain. That I've fought her every step of the way. I tried telling her I appreciated the help but I'm only looking for options to make this affordable, not to make your job hard on purpose. Sorry my poverty level is such a pain in the ass for you.

after all that shit iI told her I'm done and finally convinced her to taper me down.

Next was my fiances appointment. she just wanted to address the same issue. That we cannot afford this and need some help or other options. My fiances insurance is worse than mine so its been incredibly hard to fill her scripts. 

Probably still pissed off me, she ended up taking it all out on my fiance. She told her that she doesn't think she wants recovery because of the issues we given her (we're poor help) and that she should consider breaking up with me until we're both clean because we're just going to drag each other down (...because we can't afford medication....)

The choices you get to make after a long day of nodding out. You obviously wait as long as you can to munch because you don't want to kill your buzz in the slightest. 

For me it's pretty strange at times. I love strawberry or strawberry banana nesquik. If I'm not feeling that then I mix coca cola and milk 50/50 with a splash of cream. It's like a melted coke float and I love it. My friends give me a lot of shit for it until they try it. I also do the same with A&W Root Beer. Orrrrr I just make a float with whatever pop I'm feeling at the time. I guess I love dairy based drinks. They almost enhance my high because I'm so used to it as part of my habit and ritual. If I'm not feeling all of the above then I make a nice strong pot of peppermint tea and add some honey and a splash of cream to each cup. 

Munchies come down to three things I've noticed. Sweets usually cookies, candy bars and poptarts. Savory in the form of these vegetable fry shaped chips that come in an assortment of potato, sweet potato, spinach and carrot (hngggg), flamin hot Cheetos and Funyuns, or just basic Lays and ruffles and finally fast food. For some reason after a long day of dopin up I'm craving a juicy fat burger from McDonalds or Sonic (gotta get a shake and onion rings with that!).

My usual before bed junk food platter is a package of strawberry frosted poptarts, an assortment of mint Oreos, peanut butter Oreos, Reese's chips ahoy, store brand molasses cookies, fig newtons, a Milky Way bar, homemade bagel pizza and a coke float. If I'm just snacking it's usually those veggie fries and a huge glass of strawberry banana nesquik. 

I'm really surprised I'm not fat or diabetic.

I'm not sure if I had a dirty injection site, or if I pulled cotton or had just a dirty push buuut... I have an obvious subdermal infection. I didn't miss and get an infiltration, so there's no bruise.  It hasn't caused a surface legion/abscess yet, but I'd like it not to get that far. I'm going to try to 'cook' it out with scalding water and hot rags; I might take some old partial antibiotics (which I know is generally a no-no) to try and fight it off, but going to a doc is pretty much off the table, so if that's all you have, just know I'm a grown up and I've tabled that option for the time being.

What should I do to keep this thing from turning into a full-blown concern?

Full disclosure: its been 2-3 days, the area in question is only light pink, sensitivity of a bruise (not serious), I was shooting morphine that apparently gels (not as bad as some OCs I've had in the past, but doing the wash was out of the question, as it basically ruined the cotton).",1401949282.0

I gave some to another buddy, and he shot it up as well, he said that it made his arm blotchy and that his vein started throbbing and hurt. I don't know. This guy has a history of saying whatever he can to get more out of people, so I dont know if I believe him or not.

The REAL problem I have is that I don't have any money problems (in that I have a great job and make a lot, don't have any debt, etc), so money is not limiting me at this point. None the less, spending $3K a month on dope is NOT great for my future. Add to this that I am deeply in love with my girlfriend (preparing to propose) and the fact that I have this habit and I LIE about it, just straight up, SUCKS. Oh also I am about to go to grad school in the fall - REAL tough to be a junky, pay those pills and get the grades (I've done it in undergrad, so it can be done, just not a FUN way to live).

So, I decided I need to quit. I've quit before, and it sucked, obviously, but somehow I got through it. At that time though, I RAN from my addiction - I straight up moved to a new city with ZERO money and knowing like one friend. It saved my life. I am not as fortunate this time - I can't up and leave and I have tons of cash still.

So, this is where I am: Deleted all #s for dealers in my phone. Deleted my reddit account (woops). Threw away all my gear. I did my last shot around 4am Monday morning. I felt fine all day Monday, slept pretty well Monday night and actually woke up feeling OK on Tuesday morning (approx 27 hours). At that point I wasn't shitting my pants, but I felt pretty crappy, so I took 1mg of subs. This didn't throw me in the PWs, so I took another 2mg a bit later, and 2mg more around 11am. I still felt pretty crappy, but not horrible. I then IVd 2mg (I know, IVing subs is stupid, I get it) around 4pm and felt 100% fine. I took some xanax and slept like a baby.

Today I slept for a while, got up and did some chores and felt fine all day. Around 24 hours after my last sub dose I IV'd 2mg and I feel great again.

Now that you've read this essay (I guess it helped to get it all out), my question is:

1. How quick can I taper down without hurting too badly? Do you think I can just do 1mg tomorrow - stay with that a couple of days then drop down 1/2 mg on Saturday - then maybe 1/4 mg starting Monday - at that point I can probably just jump off? 

2. How badly is the WD from IVing subs vs under the sublingal? Significant difference?

3. Any suggestions how to kill the cravings? I have a sever needle addiction as well, so I think I will just shoot some water to help that? But I am dying to shoot some dope. I try to stay busy, but I tend to think about it ALL the time.

Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it. Again. it's been a long time since I got through this, I know I can again, but it's difficult (as many of you know).

Cheers.

Here's how,"Needed to get it off my chest. Got high as a kite yesterday and when high came up with a great idea to cheat

1) buy a clear plastic ruler - 30cm is best

2) get a pencil that's quite soft

3) with the pencil, write all the notes you need on the ruler. If small font you can fit a shit ton on one

4) make sure the desk your sitting on is dark colour, or have a dark coloured pencil case and put on that against that

5) the pencil can't be read against a dark background

6) when you need the notes/ formulae whatever, simply move the ruler into your white paper and underline something or pretend to

7) when the pencil is against a white background you'll be able to see all the notes easily

8) if an invigilator gets suspicious in anyway (they normally don't give a shit ) just run your finger/hand over the pencil on the clear plastic ruler- wiping it clean it completely so they'd never be any proof

Happy nods (and cheats) all my fellow amstericans

Let me know what you think? - ""Drugstore Detour""","The phone vibrates in Brian’s lap and, taking his hand off the wheel, he reaches for it only to knock it unceremoniously between the center console and the driver’s seat, where he sat in the late model gold Toyota on his way to pick up his roommate from work.

“Fuck my life,” Brian mumbles under his breath, wiping the cold snot lining his nostrils across the arm of the long-sleeved shirt he’s been wearing for the past three days.  Actually, who can count?  He may well have been wearing it the whole week.

He reaches down to the power cord plugged into the cigarette lighter, wanting to fish the slippery phone out from no-hands’ land and, attempting to stifle a sneeze, pulls the plug right out from the back of the phone which falls back into the abyss with a taunting “cli-clack”.

The decoupling causes a sudden give in the taught cable and sends him into a rage.  He pulls the plug out of the dash and proceeds to whip himself on his bare calf with the cable.

“Awrrghhh,” he whines, rearing back with the cable to strike himself again.

“Yea, take it bitch,” he commands of himself, a slight smile appearing just above what might have been a five o’clock shadow at five o’clock some four days ago.

“It hurts so good, doesn’t it?  You fucking weirdo.”

His legs, previous poster-children of restless leg syndrome, temporarily stop their rapid shaking as he rubs the red strip slowly rising up in his pale skin.  He grabs some of the ginger hair that keeps his legs from being mistaken for exsanguinated corpse flesh and twists it hard one time before rearing back with the green USB cable.  He bears down with the cable again, harder this time and lets out a yelp, seemingly of pain, but the look on his face, that silly crooked smile of someone who is truly losing it, says otherwise.  The hierarchy of pain is an odd thing, but Brian has learned to take advantage of it during these times of withdrawal.

“Moments ago I hurt everywhere.  Now I just hurt right here,” he thinks to himself, rubbing the red strip of raised flesh, trying to convince himself that he’s not some masochistic lunatic.

These symptoms happen whenever Brian goes more than 24 hours without his almighty cure-all, his heroine: heroin.  He’s already spent all the money that he so slickly conned out of his aunt on his insatiable habit and is now rushing to pick up his roommate, the wonderful Sandra, who very well may want to send him on a sketchy mission to procure more of the holy substance.  She would undoubtedly share with him, just as he had with her.  To be quite honest though, she’s carried much more of the burden in this relationship than he.  This fact makes him want to escape from the reality of it all the more.

He hits the cruise control, pulls forward on the seat belt and, like a contortionist, reaches his hand around the back of and underneath the driver’s seat, retrieving the elusive phone with his finger tips.  He pulls it into view, corrects the course of the vehicle with his knee on the wheel, narrowly missing the back end of an 18-wheeler, and reads the offending message from Sandra: “I’ve got an emergency faculty meeting and won’t need you to pick me up for at least another hour.  Why don't you go pick up new points at the pharmacy?  We’ll get well after I get off.”

“Son of a bitch,” Brian whines, thinking about the eternity that another hour of this torture will feel like.
He thinks about the difficulty of picking up new insulin syringes, what Sandra referred to as “points.”  

This requires him to walk up to the pharmacy counter and act like a straight, up-standing citizen who suffers from diabetes, a simple enough task under normal circumstances, but far more difficult when sweating profusely and actively experiencing the paradoxical relief of the inflicted pain of USB cables and mini-Indian burns.

Brian would very much like both to “get off” and to “get well,” however, so he plugs “Walgreen's” into the phone to receive GPS directions to the nearest one.  There is one just two blocks further down from where he was heading already, passed Sandra’s work.  He starts taking deeper breathes, trying to calm down, and takes some Axe body spray out of the center console.  He sprays himself across the chest and under his arms, hoping that the clean smell will deter any upstanding citizen from seeing the truth of his deplorable circumstances.

The sudden smell tickles his nose and sends him into another sneezing spell.  To sneeze eight times in a row and not crash the car is no small feat, but his pride is short-lived as a cramping pain in his bowels causes him to almost double over in his seat.  A sound like a bubbling oil pool emanates from and rumbles his whole torso.  He scantly wishes for death, an end to all this needless, self-induced suffering.  He slams on the brakes, noticing the light ahead is red, but he slides too far into the intersection.  He sees the flash of the red light cameras snapping a picture of the license plate.

“God dammit!  Sandra is going to kill me,” Brian said aloud.  The car he’s driving is Sandra’s and she would be responsible for that ticket.  He has already got her a ticket once before.

“I am the worst friend ever.  I really think people would be better off if I were dead.”

The light turns green and Brian pulls forward and into the Walgreen's.  He gets out of the car and into the store, walking towards the pharmacy.  He tries to go into the men’s room but the door is locked.  He bumps into a lanky man of about six feet with a large black trench coat on in spite of the extreme heat outside.  He shoves Brian a little bit forward, saying “Watch it, ass hole.”

Brian, needing more than anything to empty his bowels, calls out “Sorry,” as he passes by him en-route to the counter waving a hand up in apology without looking back.  He asks the pharmacist quickly for the keys to the bathroom, trying not to look as desperate as he truly was.  The long-haired Indian woman with a ruby bindi in her third-eye smiles and reaches into her lab coat pocket and shifts around inside.  She pulls out the keys and slides them jingling across the counter toward Brian’s outstretched, grateful hands.  He thanks her and quickly makes his way into the restroom.  He has no time to be concerned with putting the sanitary covers over the seat and, only slightly grossed out, drops his trousers and sits immediately on the unsuspecting toilet.  He lets out a small wail of simultaneous pain and relief in accompaniment to the sound of a bucket splashing into a lake which emanates up from between and beneath his legs.

He sits there, almost out of breath, but feeling very relieved.  He hears two loud banging noises through the bathroom door.  “Someone’s shitty car must be back-firing in the parking lot,” he thinks to himself.  He takes another few minutes on the commode to ensure the anal onslaught is over, and satisfied that it is, cleans himself up, washes his hands and face in the sink and dries up in the ridiculous blower attached to the wall, its jet engine drowning everything out, and echoing all over the tile bathroom.

He turns back to find where he set the keys to the bathroom and heads out to the pharmacy counter, ready at last to try and social engineer his way to some new points.  He opens the door and makes his way to the counter.

“Holy shit,” Brian thinks to himself as he notices the cash register lying on its side at the foot of the counter.  Bottles lay all around it and a large metal cabinet, usually locked until the pharmacist accesses its contents, lays open at a 45 degree angle tipped over the counter.  He looks around but there is not a single worker in sight.  He rushes over and notices that all the bottles strewn across the counter and floor are controlled substances: narcotics!

“Holy shit!  Don’t mind if I do,” he says to himself, grabbing a shopping bag and filling it with all of the bottles he could grab.  Oxycontin, roxicodone, meperidine, demerol, dilaudid, morphine, methadone, some fentanyl transdermal patches, and a few other things that even his street pharmacist brain had never heard of were all thrown in the bag.

Just when he was finishing up looting all the bottles on his side of counter, he leans over to see if he missed anything.  On the floor just on the other side lay the long-haired Indian pharmacist, breathing shallowly and holding a wound on her neck, blood pouring out between her fingers.  Brian immediately loops the pharmacopoeia over his sweaty, bony shoulders and jumps over the counter, grabs a spare lab coat hanging nearby and rushes to the pharmacist, immediately applying pressure with the coat.  It quickly soaks through with the blood spewing from her neck.  Her eyes look glossy and are wide with terror as she squeezes on Brian’s bicep as though she believes that if she could just hold on to this sickly junkie, the rushing darkness would not overcome her.  All would be well and she could be tricked by Brian into selling him the works he came for.

Brian quickly ascertains that this poor woman is lost to the world.  Should he hold on with her till the bitter end, or should he break away with enough drugs to sate his thirst for at least a month?  As he makes his decision a rookie police officer rushes into the pharmacy,  his Glock 9mm pistol drawn.  He sees the woman bleeding out, clutching at Brian’s arm, as he lurks over her, holding her neck with a bag full of stolen drugs slung over his shoulder.  He fires a single shot straight into the back of Brian’s head.  Brian’s face explodes into the Indian pharmacist’s dead eyes, her bindi lost in the dots of scarlet spraying her face.

“Police!” shouts the rookie officer.",1401904429.0

as of right now, my job depends on be being clean off dope. i fear if i don't tell him about the methadone and it shows up as an opiate/opiod on the test he administers (not sure what kind it will be yet) he would most definitely think i'm still on heroin.

TL;DR  what does methadone show up as on 6-panel test? what about suboxone? should i tell my employer i am on a maintenance program since he already knows i'm on dope (and needing to get clean to stay employed by him?)

I'm honestly scared to answer her questions and have a discussion about it. Yes I know she only wants the best for me. But sometimes I feel like she traps me with my answers and uses them against me later so it makes me not want to be open with her.

She snoops around in my room when I'm not home. She finds cleans and also all my dirty rigs and used stuff. At one point she even counted the rigs I used to figure out how much I was doing each day. She thinks my addiction is out of control and that no one is helping me at my clinic and I've tried to tell her that it really isn't as bad as it looks. I do a point a day in two half points, so two shots a day. I use new needles so they collect fast.

I've been tapering off my methadone so I can switch to sub. I've gone down from 110ml to 70ml in the last month. I still need to get down to 30-40ml before i can make the switch. i haven't explained this yet to my mom but shell find out about it soon enough because I have to give her the receipts for May so she can claim it on her insurance.

She doesn't feel like whatever Im doing now is working for me, which i have to somewhat agree with because its not. methadone isn't helping me not want to use drugs and all it did was increase my tolerance. she doesn't realize that my situation really isn't that bad. Out of all the people that go to my clinic, I'm probably doing the best. My doctor trusts me. I get the max amount of carries they're allowed to give. I'm in school and I work part time.

She always accuses me of lying to my doctor. Her reasoning is that he wouldn't give me carries if he knew or they would kick me out of the program. I've tried to tell her that this isn't the US so what she reads online doesn't always apply to every clinic. I tell her I always tell him the truth and she continues to accuse me of lying to her.

I don't know what to do. She also asks difficult questions like ""why did you use in the first place what horrible thing happened to you"" and i feel like i don't have a good answer to that question. I've tried to say that i was stressed out with full-time school and full-time work and having to take care of my own apartment and she'll respond with ""but you could have moved back home at any time, it didn't have to be that way"" but its like hello we didn't get along at that time!!

How do you guys talk to your parents about your drug addiction? I don't even know where to start. I feel like she always jumps on what I say and holds it against me later. I've never really been the type to be open with my parents. I usually just keep things bottled up inside. how would you go about this? and if you've had this type of talk with you parents, how has it gone? what would you change or do better?

TL;DR How to explain to your biased mom that your addiction isn't as bad as she thinks it is. And how to make her understand. And how would you handle the discussion?",1402040007.0

It's only September but, on this day I am cold, God am I cold.

   ""Ten day supply of 31 gauge insulin syringes."" I know all the things to say to get my needles without a prescription and more importantly without a hassle. She reaches for beneath the counter and hands me a fresh pack. Her eyes told me she knows the truth, she knows I'm a lying junkie incapable of living without my dope. She says nothing as she rings up the score and I pay the $1.92. 
   
  Her cold stare would make me uncomfortable, hell I should be embarrassed but, how could I feel bad when I knew relief was as close as the nearest bathroom stall. I turn away saying nothing and step off to the restroom, a nervous smile growing on my face.

Batch #1:
Brown powder with little rocks, strong vinegar smell, foul taste in back of throat. Onset was gradual and took at least 10 minutes (sniffing). My sinuses closed up immediately after sniffing and took 2 days to recover. Primary effects were strong sense of nausea in abdomen, killed hunger dead. Secondary effects were a warm and comforted feeling, sudden need to vomit 5hrs later (after first use or after a break). Taking double the dose and I couldn't see straight and started to nod. Seems like high purity, uncut Heroin to me.

Batch #2:
Light tan powder with little rocks, strong vinegar smell, foul taste in back of throat. Onset took 2 mins to feel it but then onset slows and nothing much happens (sniffing). My sinuses barely close up at all and recover fast. Primary effects are strong sense of nausea (very unpleasant like being really car sick). Secondary effects are hiccuping, feeling hot unwell, shaking and shivering (e.g. chattering of teeth), mild headache, sudden need to vomit 5hrs later and again 3hrs after that. Taking a big dose (easily the most I ever did) made me sick for over 18hrs, no warmth at all and no nod. Seems strong because a small amount makes me sick.


Batch #1 was great but I'm not even sure what's in batch #2. Does it even sound like Heroin to you? I don't understand why there is no warmth at all. I only sniff it so far. Will it be different if I I/V it or plug it? It came from darknet and the vendor has endless stream of positive reviews so it feels like I am doing something wrong. What do you think?

But not this morning. I hit a good fat vein that I can't see or feel - I just know the general area from watching my frequent blood draws. And the dope hit me right away.

I have tried every sort of pill and injection and physical therapy to stop my pain but nothing works, nothing except opiates.

I'll get listed as a drug abuser and never get the pain relief I need ever again. Can't there be a better system out there for drug addicts with pain?

A lot of you may not know me but I've struggled with addiction for years now.  I would post dope porn, comment like an asshole when I was sick to piss people off, and also offer support to those in need.  I am at the end of my fucking rope here.  Any input will be appreciated.

I'm sure every junkie or even user out there has had a moment of pure helplessness.  No emotions except defeat.  I've felt this way for close to two weeks.  

I got my second DUI last June, and lost my license in December for two years.  I was homeless for a little bit and eventually found a place.  Got a new job paying pretty well off the bat, and easily had transportation to work.  So the DUI was manageable.  The fines, are not.  I was always fucking up and not paying the court or the surcharges (two separate payments) and copping dope.  They'd add up and I'd get a warrant.  Then pay them off, and be sick for a week or steal or middle or whatever.  Then I started missing days calling out sick.  Didn't have dope or my dboy would be around while I was at work? Call out.  Have dope in the morning and say Fuck work?  Call out.  I got high at work too.  It finally caught up to me when I was fired.  I tried unemployment but I have a phone interview scheduled.  That's not going to go well.  Should I bring up mental issues?  I mean I've been to treatment twice, both dual diagnosis for addiction as well as depression, manic depressive, and bipolar.

I honestly feel like I can never have anything good going for me because I always muck it up and lose it all to start over again.  I need to change the cycle.  I stopped doing opiates over a week ago, I honestly forget the actual date considering I've been out of work going on week 3.  I haven't done Jack shit to look for a job though.  Sit on reddit in my room and watch dvds all day and read.  I haven't left.my.house in a week, my room in about two. I have been thinking about rehab again . the only reason I can't do that is my parents have already been dealing with their other son in and out of treatment for two Years, and frankly idk what would happen if I told them this.  I can't do that.  I have been taking subs though, And feel like at this point I need to find an easy job close by and just work.  


I'm so mad at myself.for losing this job.  I had people vouch for me and shit, and now I have to face them and tell them I fucked up. at least they don't know I was using hopefully. That'd be worse I guess.

My whole reason posting this here is any friend I have who I'd tell this to would offer nothing informative since they haven't been there.  And I'm not looking for solutions.  The answer is to stop using, get a job, stay clean, etc.  I'm just typing.out some anxious thoughts here so I don't explode from keeping them inside.  I have also been smoking a fucking ton of weed since I can make a wuick buck off it.  Its helped me mellow out from my mood last week, which was I WANT TO DIE FUCK THIS I WANT HEROIN FUCK IY FUCK EVERYTHING.  That was fun.  

So yeah, anyone feeling rough lately care to shoot the shit?  I'd rather listen and try to talk to other people than bitch about my problems anyway.

I know a good deal of us play world of Warcraft and quite a few on Stormreaver-US where the reddit guild is. Well, I formed a guild and thought it'd be interesting to get some of my bropiates into a guild that I've formed. It's on Stormreaver, just like the reddit guild, and I'll try recruiting some non-opiate users as well, but I figure you guys might want a guild where you can get high and be open about it, as is I'm the only OPIATE user in the guild but it's also brand new guild.

Heres the pitch: The guild is called Malevolent Judgement, it's a level 25 guild(and only a few days old, we inherited the guild from a group that was transferring or the guy who I formed it with bought it or something, I don't know and don't care about that aspect). The plan is for the guild to be a PVE guild, and for players to do PVP at their own discretion(I play a warrior, so obviously I enjoy playing arms and smashing some alliance face). We do plan to start raiding as soon as we have the members and really, really take the WoD scene by storm, at least on this realm.

Our goal is to create a guild with a community like atmosphere not unlike what was seen in Burning Crusade and WOTLK, where guilds were more than just a guild bank and a group that you barely talked to unless you needed something, we use raid call and talk a lot, like players did during burning crusade, ever since players can gear themselves up completely without a guild, the community sense of the game has completely fallen by the way side. We're recruiting all classes, speccs, ilevels(which these days seems to be the only thing that's important to guild, we wanna flip that on it's head, and prove that skill is more important than anything else, that, and having FUN with your guildmates). I know this is a pretty weird place for a WoW guild recruitment thread, but this community is pretty close knit because we're joined by something that most of society doesn't understand and never will, so if you play wow, I'd love it if you guys gave my guild a shot.

i'm what they call a ""chipper"" I guess, but i sincerely take opiates about 2-4 a year. I take mostly 10/7mg hydrocodone or some version of a percocet. I believe I have have successfully been chipping because 1. tolerance grows ridiculously fast, 2. the prices for pharm-grade pills are insane, 3. i don't like going 5 days without shitting. I take maybe 20-30 of these pills over the course of a week.

my natural inclination is to get some small quantity of #4 and sniff a ""point"" .... I know this is a slippery slope but that's one of the good things about the DNM for me - no absolute instant gratification; i have to semi-plan out a drug use.

so my question is, would that give me the best value for my money? I was reading somewhere on here a 40mg of opana could last someone 8 uses (at. pretty much the dose I was using).

I'm open to suggestions, but IVing is not an option. hate needles, too hard to hide, etc. etc. etc.

I did a methadone taper, tried to do it as smooth as possible. The only timesI've slept since was the last of the dope was five days after the methadone, and then again 12 days after that with I took some subs. I just got the shit right in my closet is all - but  first time was 2mg and the other time was less. In the other days of no sleep I'm trying to get down with all kinds of shit. I've got clonodine or whatever the generic blood pressure version of the pill I got I got some of those little vagina pellets etilozam or whatever the shit they are and assumed it was crap cause I was taking a bunch of them and still no sleep. Not so sure now cause I got some klonopins from someone that I know that has a script and I still can't sleep..

Anyhow, along with those blood pressure pills and the benzos I'm taking a benadryl, dxm, weed of course. All it does is make me walk diagonal so that I fall over and knock shit over on every trip to the bathroom. But - no sleep. In a way taking all the crap is worse cause then I can't even get it together for long enough to watch a movie or read something. I've tried not taking anything and I'm still in a craze either way - just that one comes with an unsturdy fog. I even take valerian root and melatonin. I'm sucking buddhas dick cause I heard that can help. Now, by sucking buddha's dick I mean any guy that says he is budha. It's a rough scene, I'm not even gay, it's repulsive to me (no offense if you gay, I'll cheer you on as you suck a dick I just won't join) -  and by saying I read that somewhere I mean a youtube comment that looked like it came from a 12 year old. 

But really, enough with the cocksucking shenanigans - whose dick do I have to get like just a couple hours of knocked on my ass zzzs ? Only think I can think of is ketamine, and that's not really something they have in my hood or any of the surrounding hoods. I'm even exercising during the day. Maybe I can break into the zoo and get a tranquilizer dart or two. Maybe I can buy one of those online. So, any ideas are welcome. Insomnia was a big reason for my initial attraction to heroin. 

inb4: I know dope will work. Can't go there now for too many reasons. I've been on sub maintenance too an that's a stubborn engagement and a resolute motherfucker to get off of. Maybe I just need to get put down like Lenny in mice and men. Anyone care to talk about mending rabbits of?

Not going to any recovery sub cause I don't really want to have anyone inform me that what I'm doing is self medicating. I tip my fucking hat to you astuteness - but for now I'm just asking if anyone knows how I can do it better. ",1402209019.0

(BTH > ECP),"K so my main dealer is originally from NC and we've been kicking it a lot lately. He's actually made the transition from d-boy to homie.. We're both 26, we're into the same music, oh and he gets the best shit ever. We live in Cali, so it's all BTH all day. I've never tried ECP so I can't definitively say BTH is better, but all I know is that the top shelf stuff I've been getting is hard to beat..

So my guy's best friend from NC is coming out to stay with him for the summer, and I happen to live near the airport. So after my guy picks his homie up from the airport they come to my pad to chill. Cast: me, my guy, my guy's ridiculously hot gf, and his homie fresh off his flight from North Carolina... It's about 11am.. We start doing dabs of dope out of his roor.. Then we all do a shot.. We all did .1 shots to test the new batch.. Probably .08 to be honest. And we were even talking about what's better BTH or ECP, dude from nc says he thinks they're about the same. I can't comment having never tried ECP. My guy, who is well versed in both, says ""nah dog, this stuff I get out here is insane! Way better than the shit back in NC"".. His homie asks to do a .2 shot as he's used to doing .3 or .4 at a time. My guy says ""nah I'm giving you .1"" and he weighed him out .08 (thank god he did). So his homie does his 'less than a point' shot and starts nodding within 2 minutes. He then gets off his chair and sits on the floor. 

We're jamming on guitars and chatting when my guy notices his homie ain't moving. He starts yelling his name and he is out! So the three of us jump into rescue mode. My guy starts slapping him in his face, hard. Dude ain't moving. The gf puts her hand on his chest to feel his heartbeat. It's barely beating. I break out a suboxone strip and we try and get it under his tongue. That shit was difficult. We take a water bottle and pour a little in his mouth to help the strip dissolve. It works. We're still shaking him and slapping him and yelling his name. He will not move. He's starting to turn blue. So me and my guy carry him to my bathroom. Luckily my roomate's not home lol.. We get him in the tub and turn on the shower. He's still breathing. At this point his color started coming back so we didn't call the ambulence. We stayed with him for about a half hour. I'll never forget the giant gasp he took when he came to.. Fucking crazy. If he had been alone, he would have literally stopped living. I'm never shooting up alone again. Or at least not a fat shot hahaha.. After he finally got up he made it back to my room and slept for the next 8 hours or so. He said he didn't remember anything, but he now concedes that BTH is indeed stronger than ECP.. 
Of course it could just be that the quality BTH we get is better than the ECP he was getting back home.. I'm sure there's top shelf ECP that's way better than shitty BTH, but still. That whole experience was pretty crazy.

tl;dr friend from North Carolina came to Cali.. Was here for no more than an hour before doing his first shot of BTH. OD'd, stopped breathing, turned blue.. Luckily we saved his life, thanks to suboxone, a cold shower, and acting fast.. ",1402186944.0

I used to donate plasma all the time in undergrad at DCI Biologicals, but I was never a shooter then. I have been IVing in the crook of my arm for about 2 months now, and I am going to another DCI Biologicals in my hometown. 

Do you guys know if they check for tracks? I figure I'll explain it away by saying that it's there from when I used to donate all the time, it's not like they can't probably verify that that's true, right? For a little background, I'm a white super preppy girl and I'm actually a complete needle phobe, so needles make me very anxious. I think I can explain this away or maybe they won't notice if I ask them to go in the other arms because I'm ""more comfortable"" with it. Of course, I'll also wear long sleeves.

I take mostly 10/7mg hydrocodone or some version of a percocet. I would take maybe 20-30 of these pills over the course of a week, or 2-3 hydros at a time. 

So I ended up buying a #4 stamp, I also misunderstood the term ""point."" I did not mean to imply I was going to do an entire point at once, never using anything other than pharms in the past.

If I want to get a similar high to aprox 20mg of hydro, what's a suggested MG to sniff? I can eyeball a keybump OK, or about 15mg worth of other powder. I also have an mg (to the .001) scale to weigh accurate for later eyeballing. I don't want to get fucked up in the club or whatever, I just trying to obtain the effect above.

How long does the ""high"" for something like this last?

And if I do say ""1 bump"" of this, is there something else I should absolutely not do? I.e. not drink alcohol, take 2mg of xanax, whatever.

Sorry for the ""noob"" questions - trying to be safe. Also I decided not order again because someone brought up a good point - i'm doing this 2-4 times a year it's prob better if I stick with the more expensive route of hydros so I'm not tempted in the future.

CONTEST: share your DETAILED, EFFECTIVE, HIGH-YIELD, SAFE, and FOOLPROOF method: f(poppy seeds, other ingredients) => PST extract (or some other SOLID poppy-seed based extract)

REWARDS:

0.15 BTC for sharing the BEST formula (ie textual instructions), which will be evaluated by myself and the r/opiates community by rubric: 1. accuracy 2. yield 3. detail 4. safety 5. easiness 6. time to complete 7. any other benefit to your recipe that makes shit better

0.15 BTC for sharing the BEST demo (preferably video, but images will suffice) of your preferred method from #1

0.05 BTC for sharing the BEST formula/demo for POPPY PODS rather than seeds (these are harder to come by, more in a legal grey area, and therefore less appealing to those of us who wish to steer clear of ANY legal interaction

0.05 BTC for sharing the BEST demo (preferably video, but images will suffice) of your preferred method from #1, with the exception that it can be a liquid result. You CANNOT win this AND the 0.15 BTC award for best recipe for obvious reasons (dump the powder in the water bro??!!) 

0.10 BTC for providing both the BEST demo AND the BEST method in addition to the separate 0.15 BTC awards.

This means that if you are a fiend you potentially stnd to make 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.10 = 0.40 BTC from the solid extraction demo/guide produced quickly, plus 0.05 for providing a corresponding poppy pod guide.

Realize this is not a HUGE reward but cmon man we're talking at least a few hundred bucks for your words. Plus BTC is back, moving on up.

I suggested a method below that was incredibly naive and shitty, so I wont win, but so you know I CAN win if I suddenly figure this out. Obviously though I can't which is why I'm offering $ to figure it out here.

If you wish to participate please feel free to provide VOTES to the posters who are participating. Especially if you have used a similar method. This will make it easier for me to evaluate who's legit.

Finally, after all is said and done, I will post this guide somewhere (r/opiates?) so all PST lovers in the world may rejoice.

== original post ==

longtime lurker. couldn't find a thread about this. if there has been one, i apologize. point me in the right direction.

anyway, love poppy seed tea but hate the:

1) effort
2) amount of liquid to consume
3) material requirements (2L's and funnels)
4) lack of portability
5) tendency to waste 2nd and 3rd pass liquid

i've been wondering for a while now whether it would be possible to create a PST concentrate, either liquid or (better yet) solid, by for instance

1) making a BIG FUCKING batch of tea (say, 50 lbs of quality seeds) using conventional 2L + citric acid + cold water
2) do step 1 for at least 3 or 4 passes
3) add something with a lot of fat that isnt revolting
4) tapioca malodextrin bitches

this is based on absolutely NO  knowledge of anything. i have no exp with tea beyond steps 1 and 2, and I'm trying to work my steps here :)

ok so time to stop being a dick - and start being a dousche -

i will award 0.15 BTC to whoever comes up with the best method, in theory, for the extraction - TO POWDER OR OTHERWISE SOLID FORM

0.15 BTC more to whoever comes up with the best video or image tutorial based on theory

== caveats ==

PODS DONT COUNT.

However, if you come up with both an extraction method and demo based on use of pods, and we like it here, I'll chip in 0.05 BTC. A bit nickel if you will

== more fine print ==

LIQUIDS DONT COUNT.

same deal though. if you can get the liquid down to a manageable volume (say, 10 lbs seed at 95% + extracted in 100 mL) - 0.05 BTC.

== less fine print - make more $ == 

finally 0.10 BTC if you can provide the BEST method AND BEST demo within 72 hours of this post. That's 0.40 BTC!

Full disclosure: I am in the running with my shitty suggestion above, but i fully expect and pray i do not win because i don't think that shit will work.

Full disclosure 2: i am fucked up at the moment from pst but have had to pee every hour or so because of the STUPID volumes of liquids consumed. however, despite my vangrancy, i promise that YOU WILL GET PAID.

fyi, i am working with Afghani seeds purchased in bulk from an online retailer.

as for determination of ""best"" it will be up to me although i will heavily consider feedback of others.

may the best lady (or man) win!

goooood luck my buds.

EDIT: no rules violation i believe because I am giving, not begging, for BTC. also I am asking for PURE ADVICE and not ANYTHING to do with sourcing what so ever.

EDIT 2: if you participate post your address either in thread or pm me. I will send the coins using a tumblr of your choice but ONLY IF YOU REQUEST THIS.",1402324047.0

The effects are mostly gone now (this was 6 hours ago.) I want to feel that again, but is it too soon to re-dose? If I chew up another 200mg will it do anything or just waste it?

Does some end up wasted? If so, whats your best rules for making sure you get it all? I'm real stoked to try these since the dope has been awful locally and I am living with parents temporarily so darknet/mail is out of the question for right now. 

The bags in my area are completely awful recently and I will do as many as 20 to get a decent rush (its not so much the dope itself as that there is just nothing in the bags, to say the average amount in a bag is 0.03 would be generous- often they are completely empty or contain dope that if shaken to a corner is about the size of the end of a ballpoint pen).

I am pretty excited to try these but worried since I IV that its not going to be as good as back when I snorted stop sign 40s even (with a much lower tolerance). The most dope I've done is probably about 0.3 in a shot of some real strong ECP from darknet, so where should I start with these G74s when I get a shot to IV? My thought was do a quarter and see where that takes me. I honestly will be really happy just to know I am getting something consistent but I also want to make sure these are worth it with the new formulation.

FYI I usually spend 400-420 on a brick and these are for 100 a pop so what do you guys think?

I still haven't had a chance to talk to my doctor, because I just got the letter in the mail today...  but basically my healthcare provider is no longer going to cover Suboxone starting July 1, 2014 (thanks for the heads up, assholes).   They list Zubsolv as a ""lower-cost option"" on this letter, but do not state if it will be reduced price, or simply purchased with a co-pay as I do now.

That's not my primary question, though... what I really want to know, is if any of you have had experience with and/or know whether my doctor will even be able to prescribe this Zubsolv or not?   I had never heard about the drug until today, and have never heard my doctor mention it before.   The doctor I see specializes in neuro-medicine, and has begun treating people with addiction problems... so I would think they could prescribe it?   But I don't know.

Any nuggets of wisdom from someone in the know would at least slow my heart rate down at this point.  The difference between subs being covered and not being covered... is me being bankrupt.  I cannot afford $20 a day.

So i start to walk back to where my car is parked and im trying to use my keys to find it. Its fucking gone. Got towed, I go into panic mode and this security guard comes up with a shit eating grin on his face and tells me he knows where i went and why. So he had it towed. Then he tells me hes gonna search me. Fuck no i swallow that bitch and he notices and makes sum stupid comment about it.

I'm planning out my kicking endeavor now, despite having some medical issues where pain management is needed I've found that I'm not enjoying myself any more. No amount of dope, pills or what have you gives me any euphoria any more. It's just the next dose to stay well. As such I'm planning on getting clean to take a little break and sort my life out. I know I'll probably return once I reach my goals and I'm okay with that. I just want my tolerance to go back down and experience extended sobriety for a bit. Bliss without suffering becomes suffering itself. 

So my goal is to make the acute withdrawal period as minimal as possible. My habit in a tangible measurement is about equal to 400mg Roxicodone/day. Some days it's dope, some days it's Diluadid, some it's CWE norcos. So first on the agenda is:

1.) Titrate my doses down over 8 weeks, whilst I acquire the things I need for when I'm off. I chose a long titration period because I want to guarantee my success. I know cold turkey makes me much more likely to go drive down town and find a dboy. I've never done a proper weaning before and this may make things a lot easier. 
2.) My shopping list for things I'm going to stockpile for the week of withdrawal symptoms: 

•Loperamide- standard protocol. I'm on the fence since I suffer from bad constipation even while sober, but invaluable during the runs. 
•Lunesta and Ambien- Anything that helps guarantee a full night sleep is to be worshipped. These drugs work for me and I'm planning on rotating between them to keep tolerance down. Have to remember my goal is to sleep, not get buzzed and play with the ambien walrus. 
•Xanax and Valium- Not wanting to replace one addiction with another but I can take benzos here and there without worry. Great for mood stabilization, getting rest and muscle relaxation
•Soma- For when RLS and muscle spasms are kicking my ass
•Multivitamin with focus on amino acids, magnesium, zinc, b vitamins and vitamin c. All stuff I'm probably deficient in these days. 
•Coca Leaf Tea- Nausea, oxygenation, and mood elevation. I've heard great things about drinking a cup of this in the morning during withdrawals. 
•Peppermint Tea- Nausea and mental relaxation. For me it's just a thing I enjoy the taste of. It calms me down when I'm wound up. 
•Kava Kava- Another ethnobotanical I've heard great things about. I can't take kratom due to it causing terrible anxiety and restlessness for me. 
•DXM only Robitussin- I've found that 150mg of DXM daily helped with past withdrawals immensely. I don't know why scientifically but I have seen it mentioned on OTC wd help threads on various forums. 
•Cigarettes- this isn't a time to add more stress by trying to quit something else too. 
•Fresh Passion flower and dwarf skullcap- I was lucky and my garden has grown well. I've heard some interesting things about these plants. Some conflicting. What I've gathered is they can be potent and psychoactive when fresh but lose much of their strength while dried out. Just various ways to occupy my mind and attempt relaxation. 
•Mary Jane- 2 lunesta, a mug of peppermint tea, and a fat bowl of kind and I'm out like a light. 
•2 L of mineral water a day- Hydration can help immensely I hear. 
•A weeks worth of my favorite junk, comfort and chocolate foods- Any semblance of comfort and happiness is welcome. 

I apologize for the piss poor formatting as I'm on mobile right now. Is this idea and shopping list a step in the right direction? Are there some things I've forgotten that would help me out? Any tips and insight would be very appreciated. I'm trying to make the withdrawals suck as little as possible this time. 

Much love.  ",1402438078.0

So far my withdrawals are not that bad.  I could kick them quite easily if I could just smoke pot all day and then take Ativan to sleep.  

Unfortunately I have to work and life at this time will not allow for that.  I can't smoke before work, and I can't be good enough at 50% while I'm suffering.

Fortunately, a time is coming up very soon where I have what I need to go through withdrawals.  

But what if there things that would help me feel, at the least, ""normal"" enough to work?  Then I could stop buying dope sooner, and kill this first long term binge I've ever been on.

I have heard about methadone, and stuff like that, and I'm sure a vic 5 or two for the really shitty hours would be enough.

I'm on vacation with my girlfriend and did finished of the oxy and dope I brought about half way through the trip. I waited as long as I could by knocking myself out with Xanax, weed, and beer last night. That makes it about 24 hours since I last did any real opiates when I ripped open and scraped out all of my old dope bags and smoked the last of my oxy (I know most people in this sub think smoking pills is stupid/wasteful, but I fucking love it way more that sniffing or shooting).

This morning I woke up way before I normally would because I was really starting to feel sick. I've definitely been sicker before. Probably could have lasted a few more hours, but I thought maybe I'd be able to go back to sleep, so I sniffed around 2 mg of my subutex and immediately felt significantly better. Not high, but hardly sick anymore, maybe still some chills and nausea.

So, from here I have a few different options. By far the most appealing choice right now to my junkie brain is to crush up some more subutex, sniff it, and try to get high. Probably not a great plan if I want to do my oxy tomorrow, however, if I could stay on the subutex for a while, I could try to stockpile my oxy (I am given 3 30s in the morning and 3 more before bed when I'm at home) and either sell it and buy some dope, or just smoke a bunch and get high as fuck. The only issue with this option is that I don't know if I have the willpower to not do the oxy if I have it, even if I know the bupe will block some/most of it.

Option 2 would be to just try to survive the next 24 hours on the ~2mg I just did and take my oxy tomorrow morning. I know all of the bupe won't be out of my system, but I'm sure 90mg of oxy will still fuck me up. I could even sniff or plug it for higher BA. The main problem with this option is that I have to make a ~5 hour drive back home tonight then try to sleep somehow, and I don't know if I will be able to resist doing more subutex which would then ruin any oxy I did tomorrow morning.

Option 3 is by far the worst, but from past experience, I'm guessing it's what going to happen because I'm a stupid fucking junkie with no willpower. That would be to do enough subutex today and tonight to get high, then try to wait as long as possible tomorrow to do my oxy and hope that I can break through. That would probably give me between 12 and 18 hours since I sniffed any subutex, but to stay high today and tonight, I'd probably need to sniff between 8mg and 12mg throughout the day.

So that's where I'm at now. Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading if anyone made it to the end. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated",1402587787.0

I am very fortunate to live in an area where we have needle exchanges. For those less blessed, I have a lovely older gentleman and his adorable much older dog so by my house when I need, and like Santa, he brings jolly gifts with him: a hundred box of the absolute best needles, easy touches, for $1. I can get up to $5 (500) as long as I am exchanging a relatively equal amount of dirties, medical grade blue tournequets, cotton (these cute little pre rolled balls), alcohol swabs by the hundreds, and these tiny little cookers, all packed in a clean new sanitary sharps container. He is Santa. He is a saint. Seriously, he is a lovely person and you should shower him with tips and hugs for what he does for people like us. 

Now this is all good and awesome but for the past month, no matter what I do, I more often than not get struck with a wild case of cotton fever. Agglomerans is a bitch yo. 
I always use a new cotton, New rig, and only up until a day or two ago, I always cooked my gear till boil to ward away the nasties. 

Different dope, still get aggro'd by agglo, clean everything with alcohol, still get fucked. Wtfihatemylife. Ok so.. the only thing that remains a constant are the cottons. Brand new in the baggies he brought them to me in. 

Theory: tainted source of cotton for filters is infested with p agglomerans. I have started microwaving them extensively before use. Has anyone else heard of this? Is that possible? I would assume they would sanitise them but it would seem not. I also find using the brand name q tips solves the problem. Should I let Santa know his pile of presents is plagued with pestilence? 

Sort of separate topic: I have recently discovered that (duh) heating my shot results in a shittier shot, yes, I brain well, I know. Given tar's typically unsanitary travels and origin, it would seem unwise to do this, and I am especially gunshy for all the puking and shivering in bed I have done lately see above,

I went during the daytime, which is uncharacteristic for me. I usually go around rush hour so the cops are too busy pulling over other people and I can slip in and out. I saw a few cops and undercovers, but it looked like it had died down since I stopped going on the regular. Was it just a good day for really obvious NY white boy to get some dope? Is the day safer than night or evening (when I usually roll through)? Or, dare I say it, has Paterson calmed down? Paterson was always my goto for dope, but the heat and close calls I'd been having scared me off for a bit. It was certainly great for my tolerance, not so much my mood haha.

If it was just a lucky break for me and things aren't any better, do you guys have any suggestions? I might be setting up an appointment with a pain clinic I got a tip on thats generous with the scripts (even for types such as myself). And I have some legitimate chronic injuries I can use to back up my claim. That's gonna take some time though to get anything worthwhile, and some dedication as they usually have contracts and do UAs on some sort of regular basis. And that's if they don't just toss me out for being a drug seeker. But are there any other places somewhat close to the NY/NJ border that are safer to cop at? Not specific, just a general idea of cities and areas that might be a good place. Also, how do you get a delivery connect? Like is it just luck, knowing the right people/being in the right place at the right time, asking established connects, etc?

I would just start buying locally..but fuck that! I aint paying $15-20 PER POINT for something I can get for $4 in p town. Plus I don't trust almost anyone locally. Almost all of them are the type to roll over on someone in a heartbeat if the police apply any pressure. And the fucking cops here are just itching to bone me on something like that so I won't give em the satisfaction.

So, help a brother out?",1402541733.0

I have chronic back pain that my doctor had been treating with hydrocodone 10-325, although they would relieve the pain, the duration was not long enough and the side effects were aweful (a user from this sub helped me out with how to reduce those negative side effects) I would go weeks or even almost a month without being able to have a BM. And the nausea was aweful as well. Recently after talking with my dr about longer term pain relief I was perscribed fentanyl patches. They are amazing! I am almost pain free (my rx is the 50mcg, but I will be getting the 100mcg for my next rx). I am having a couple issues with these patches though. All questions are in bolded text after the example/reason/problem I am having. And all suggestions or advise on these patches is welcome even if it isn't related to my questions/problems. 


Also, these are the gel patches. 


1. by the third day about half of the patch is no longer sticking to my skin. It seems like the patch is no longer attached to the adhesive in these areas. **Is this normal? Is there anything I can to to prevent the separation  of the patch from the adhesive? I do frequently spend large amounts of time outside, and with it being summer now I sweat pretty badly, does that effect how effective the patch will be?**

2. When I do remove the patch it seems like 70% of the adhesive stays on my skin and is very hard to remove. **is that normal, and is there an easier way to get it off than just basically scratching it off in the shower?**


3. Relegated to question 1, the last couple patches that separated from the adhesive I used medical tape to prevent them from separating more. **when taped on to prevent more separating will there still be absorption in the areas where the patch/adhesive has separated? Or once the patch is separated from the adhesive does that mean it will no longer absorb in that area without adhesive? **


4. I had a patch come off in my sleep after i put it on earlier that night, and now it will not stick to my skin when I tried to put it back on. **is there any way to salvage the patch and be able to use it? Preferably in the manner it is prescribed to be used, but if not I would be open to other methods** 


5. In an attempt to be able to keep the patch on for the full 72hrs I used some of the medical silk tape over the patch immediately after applying the patch. **will this method have any negative effect on the patch? Is this a good method to keep the patch attached for the 72 hrs?**


6. I have been putting the patches on my back because that is where I have seen them placed on other people. **is the back the best spot to put the patches, or is there a better location to out the patch?**



Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this post and I appreciate everyone who has any advice on the use of these patches. I welcome any advice or suggestions even if it doesn't help with my questions. ",1402533652.0

For some reason I am feeling compelled to share my story today, as this is my 3rd day without any opiates (I know, big accomplishment...not).  But I have come to the realization that I need to end my love-hate relationship with opiates, heroin specifically, in order to move on in life and better myself.  I have recently moved to a new city because I got a new job with a great company.  I though this was my chance, now I have no choice but to get clean, right?  I don't know anyone, other than my girlfriends parents, who surely have never touched an opiate in their life, and I had no way of finding anything and absolutely zero chance of cold copping.  this was it.  I was finally going to kick the habit, but not by choice; although I had thought about it many times that I needed to quit, it never happened.  

This was it.  I don't know anyone, surely I will get clean.  But sure enough, ol' reliable found its way into my hands through the help of this very sub.  At first, I was so thankful that I found a ""connect"" if you will, more like a middle man, who was willing to help out a complete stranger if I just threw him one bag.  Great, no big deal, I have a job making money, of course I can spare one bag.  

Fast forward about 5 weeks to this past Monday, I have been copping off of him almost every day, and I just got paid last Thursday and my bank account is already negative (not all due to drugs, but nonetheless, I should have been more responsible with my finances).  I am beating myself up over this, and have made the decision that we have all made a million times over, I am done with opiates for a very long time.  It will make it a little easier (or harder, depending on how you look at it) to quit as my middle man is moving to Colorado (you know who you are), so I wont have a hook up any more, but I'm sure if I wanted to, I could find someone else or ask for his connect.  But I don't want to.  Not this time.  I really want to quit.  For myself, for my girlfriend who also uses, so we can both get clean, for my family, for my future children, and because I honestly feel like I am letting my family down (I know I already said my family).  I was raised in a upper-middle class family in the suburbs with a decent education, and went on a to a very reputable college in Pittsburgh and graduated with a double major.  I know this sounds like many of you, as I have read so many other stories on here, just replace Pittsburgh with your city and make change graduated with a double major to just one major, or even dropped out.  Basically all of my friends from college dropped out due to becoming addicts, I was just lucky enough that I was able to get through school.  Anyway, my dad passed away in 2011 due to cancer, and every time I take money out of my bank acct and trade it for powder and put that powder right up my fucking nose, I feel like he is watching me shaking his head, giving that look of disapproval that he always would, that I've seen so many times before.

But even more so than my family, I want to quit for myself.  I want to start to save money so I can live on my own again (currently living with said girlfriends said parents in said new city for the time being), I want to be able to enjoy a day of my life without the thought of getting high, wondering when/if/how I will get my next bun.  I want to stop the fucking chills, sweats, RLS, shits, laziness, depression, anxiety, and all of the other terrible things that come with withdrawal.  I want it all to stop, and I want to turn my life around so that I can get out of this pit I have dug myself into.  As I sit here writing this at work, the thought of dope cant get off of my mind, which I know will be the hardest part.  I can get through the physical w/d somewhat easily (I Hope), but the mental...the mental withdrawal is the absolute worst.  I CANT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT!!! 

I feel like everyone will know I am an addict if I try to attend any classes, and honestly, I feel like if me and my girlfriend go trhough this together, I think that is all the support that we will need (plus the help of weed an xannies).  I hope that is all the support that we need. I pray we can get through this next week or so together, and finally kick this demon to the curb that has had a grasp on my life for so long, I don't even like to think how long it has been.

I know this post has been all over the place, and I apologize, but I wanted to get this out there and off my chest.  Maybe you guys will hate this post, maybe love it, some relate to it, others shun it as someone else preaching to the choir, but I hope it helps maybe, MAYBE, one person.  My birthday is June 19, and I am planning on being clean for my birthday for the first time in 4 or 5 years.  Wow...4 or 5 years, its been that long.  Fuck.

Wish me luck, hopefully I'll post again in a week letting everyone know how great I am doing, and I really think I can do it.  I know its mind over matter, and I have learned this by reading around this sub, I just hope my willpower doesn't fade.

Happy nodding everyone, wish you all the best.

EDIT: Sorry, didn't mean for this to be so long.

Let's compare notes my fellow dopes","Everyone knows that the quest for dope can turn your average healthy citizen into what I like to call.... A hustler.

Fairly quickly when heroin addiction becomes normal for a person they figure out that they need to develop a ""hustle of their very own"". Everyone has a unique(ish) hustle tailored to their personality, the size of the monkey digging its stupid monkey claws into your stupid human monkey back, and/or the types of general resources available to them. When I say available resources I'm referring to job/career, creativity/intelligence, dope supply, living situation (urban, rural, super rural, super urban, hella rich in which case fuck you because I'm jealous and also because you're probably a super entitled douche and I'm allowed to wildly generalize because I'm high as balls), and the worst resource in my opinion.... friends and family. I think the friends part is what has brought you to this thread today (3 in the morning is still day I think). 

Lazy hustlers focus on the most short term solutions for their money problems. They steal anything they can get their hands on from the people closest to them because it's ""easier"" than busting into houses and robbing little old ladies. For the record, I find all forms of theft to be absolutely despicable and it's just so much worse when it is done to loved ones. If you do it then you not only deserve the crushing guilt that you should likely experience but also some help in freeing yourself from addiction because at this point you should know that you've certainly gone too far and are no longer lying to yourself that you're in charge of your addiction and instead are lying to yourself and also ROBBING YOUR FRIENDS. FUCK! Nope. They'd rather ""middle-man"" for a friend or clear out their parent's valuables at a shady pawn shop. Heroin addiction really turns most of its victims into huge cock biting monsters. Yeah, because they're not just blowing people... they're biting YOUR penis and YOUR clitoris! Now, by this time you're probably thinking that I have a holier-than-thou attitude and am putting my morals on a pedestal. To be completely honest though I am a very loyal person by nature and was taught some decent morals via nurture. My father always told me growing up that stealing is one of the most despicable things a person can do and that you should always dump your junky friends to the curb when they start snatching things they figure you wouldn't miss and that no heroin is worth the torment of being slowly bled to death by your middle manning ""friend"". Actually, my father never ever even gave me junky survival tips as a child. And so I have lied and now everything I say from here on out should be second guessed and scrutinized! This brings me to my next rantigraph.

Never *trust* your junky friends by taking everything they say at face value. This rule should extend to all junkies you know but unfortunately those closest to you can many times be the most conniving and manipulative as they quickly realize that your friendship can be leveraged in the pursuit of heroin and quantified in the points that are *cleverly* knikked out of your bags by relying on the falsely posited finickiness of your scale or the fake smile they put on for you even though their mouth may be bursting at the seams with all the daggers hiding snugly behind their shitty teeth as Macbeth, or one of his homeboys, remarked when referring to his *own* friends in the film Macbeth written by lauded 17th century English playwright J.K. Rowling. The middle man slash close friend combo is able to remain the figuratively unrelenting lower-back pain that they are by hiding in the comfortable, and legal(ish), shade of the almighty *reasonable doubt* owed to the people you grew up with and shared many coming of age experiences with including the last experience you will likely share with this person which is when you both discover dope; or more accurately, one of you discovers the once mystical bundle of heroin grazing in a sunlit copse surrounded by thick shadowy forestation. When the little critter is dumped out on a plate and painstakingly divided into snortable lines (Utilizing junky trigonometry involving a section of straw from Burger King and a razor blade, the length and width of a line is a given but many junkies tragically too often forget to take into account the height of their lines and to adjust them accordingly. Mostly because skimming the tops off of lines to make them perfectly equal in three dimentions is fucking preposterous. I'm not saying that I've never done it. I'm just saying it's fucking preposterous). Your buddy will probably urge you on by remarking how ""totally not a big deal"" heroin is these days. *sigh* Wanker.  

Middle men are able to bolster their own supply of dope by keeping a roster of people that have been deemed suckers or trusting friends but probably both. They have to maintain a very complex network of lies because they often have a unique method of ripping off each individual coming off the bench making sure not to mix up the batting oder because things will get awkward when they accidentally disclose just how bad they've been screwing you lately; and to your face too which almost makes you feel bad for them. Almost. But they're usually really good at their job so will of course they have a grand old home town ass fucking with their blunt knife cock tailor-made for your airtight virgin ass hole. Any experienced junky has been ripped off one or twelve times in their career. I should mention that those accurate yet arbitrary figures should be multiplied by 5 of course because denial can also be one hell of a drug. This is all junky math of course so you should be writing it down to reference later because again, I cannot stress this enough, math is for real - Albert Einstein, 2014. Being ripped off has the side affect of hardening up your instincts later on no matter how seethingly angry or horny you are when the wounds are still fresh. You must build up a 6th sense for teasing out the hustle beneath the stuttering droopy words of your shitty friend in order to survive and kind of sort of thrive on the junky field of battle where lots of junkies enter and checkout, but they can neverrr leeeeeave. 

I'll give you some tips that I made up in the rantigraph below.

Remember, first and foremost when trying to figure out just how deep the hustle hole goes, that the dumbest thing you could do with the first nibble of info you figure out is to throw it into their face yelling, ""aaaHA! I've been onto you the whole time."" As a junky, you should know that this will prevent you from getting the dope you were trying to get in the first place. Remember that the whole point of the mission you assigned yourself when waking up that morning was to obtain the package and return with it safely back to HQ. Not a single one of you would forgo a bleeding rectum in order to ""Totally call him out. Yeah it was awesome."" except I don't know any of you and no one is going to read any of this shit. So grow up and put your big girl pants on bro and hand over the ""gas money"" and ""convenience fee"" and the little covert transfer they make when they withdraw dope from the bag they got for *you* and deposit it in their *own* bag because fuck you for not *being* them; not being *them* is the first mistake you made when dealing with the ravenously selfish middleman critter we've been onesidedly discussing here for over half an hour by myself. It makes me angry just thinking about it but just remember that we're here to whine and complain, not accept responsibility for our own mistakes and choices because those are activities that are to be done all at once at a later unspecified date sometime in the near yet distant never. 

You want to gather intelligence, covertly and all proper spy-like, from other people you know that are victims of the middle man in question. You want to ascertain what your fellow suckers get for an overall price through totally casual conversation made all the more riveting by your new identity as a junky secret agent via some kind of psychosis that one time; remember a comfortable and casual junky is a domesticated junky so creating an atmosphere where you can get high together and complain in unison will help speed up the intelligence gathering as you both tell eachother your life stories (I hate when people you just met do that when they're high. Don't do that to people. They don't want to know that your childhood circumstances basically meant you never stood a fucking chance! You were just a lad! It's not your fault!) Anyways, by comparing the price of your dope to everyone elses you can, by using your junky abacus or slide rule, triangulate the approximation of what your middle man is getting as their own price against what you and the others are stuck with. Whoever amongst you that gets the best deal should be pried a bit further (write that shit down). Next to the actual dealer's phone number and approval, getting the price that your middle man gets is like a sad kind of holy grail for victims like us. It's a *sad* trophy because no one said this shit was going to be fun except for all those people that said ""Yeah dude, it'll be fun"". Just remember that you won't be eternally shut aaway in middle man purgatory because you will always inexplicably run into a real dealer every now and then who will put your number into his phone while you just try and act cool and safe the *geeking out* for when you're alone. So for now just ""keep your chin up"" which is what stupid people say to one another when someone's been ""dealin' wit dis drama 4 a minute"".  

You want to figure out how much dope you're getting and if the amount is in flux. Again, triangulate and abacus your way to victory or something rather; I'm getting tired. If your middle man slash friend slash lover does their drogas with you then sneak in a few pertinent questions when they're loosey goosey and feeling all honest and shit like that. Just where were they on the night of June 12^th 2014? Probably doing heroin ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Look for patterns, ask complex questions, scare their pets, catch them off guard a little bit but not enough to alert them that you're onto their middle man hustle. If your junky slash friend tells you that ""he doesn't get anything out of picking up for you"" then he is 9 times out of 10 LYING TO YOU. If he asks for $10 for gas because he's not getting anything for himself and is ""just helpin' a nigga out"" then he is 12 times out of 6 LYING TO YOU. See how that shot up to a 200% chance of lying just like that? That's a lot of things so you can trust what I say. If you're trusting me then you're already failing. In order to overcome the default advantage of the middle man you must observe the middle man who also happen to be one of your good friends, in their natural habitat. That habitat unfortunately is likely your very own heart (or stomach if you're from feudal age Japan. Ahso? Ahso). 

Always play innocent and dumb with them so that they don't alter their usual ""static defense mainframe"" (Keep up with the lingo guys. This isn't 2007 anymore, get your shit together). When they become too suspicious of your suspicion the game is over. If you are casual acquaintances, don't frequent the same places, and have an insufferable gap in things you have in common then they will probably just take all your money the very next time you break the hundred dollar mark and they have an opportunity to dump your stuff in their own bag and fill yours back up with demon cum (usually flower). You can kiss those 5 crisp twenty dollar bills (or, Junky Dabloons, as they are known by *everyone* on the inside who knows exactly what they're talking about but is cool about knowing that much stuff in a kinda way) that you hastily withdrew from the nearest ATM even though you had a feeling that something wasn't right; a gut feeling too often tragically ignored in times of erratic desperation or general arousal that one time. This unfortunate, yet typical end to the relationship you had forged with your middle man over the course of 2 months or 12 years, will occur when the awkwardness of betrayal has set in and they can no longer look into your big beautiful brown eyes you sexy person you! (Ya see! We can have a laugh every now and then! Now you take that little ego boost and tuck it in your back pocket. Never sell yourself short champ!)      


TL;DR - It's a surprisingly well structured stream of consciousness woven together almost entirely of  run-on sentences (Grammar Jenga). No one got laid and no one died. If anyone wants to contribute we can use people's personal anecdotes dealing with their own middle men as case studies in order to help out our fellow victims of middle men and other stuff that sounds good to say outloud.

One thought I had concerned promethazine.    She has a few pills of those left, not sure how many how they can potentially help.  She also has a ton of loperamide.  I've told her about the effectiveness of those before, but of course she's sketched out about drinking so much of the bottle!!

I'm thinking about pushing the lope idea because it helped me out so much while I was in Europe when I wasn't able to get any other meds.  However, there is a major difference there- I'm not a chronic pain patient.  She's ALWAYS in pain, which is why she's prescribed such powerful medication.

I know lope helps with W/Ds, but could it help get rid of pain by taking, say, 50mgs?

I'm hoping that going on suboxone will help. I've been on it before and it helped me a lot and took away my cravings.

so the problem i have is that i wanted to go down on my dose this week. i called my nurse on thursday as usual (that's my doctor day, he's only in one day a week and they changed the law so that nurses can't fill out pre-signed scripts) only for the receptionist to tell me that they were closed. wtf. since when are they closed on a random day? so i was basically screwed since there's no doctors in on friday so i couldn't get a new script. so today i went to the pharmacy and drank my one dose there and took my 6 carries home for the week.

I got 70ml when i would have liked to go down to 65ml. I've been thinking about doing some basic math and taking out the equivalent of 5ml of methadone from each bottle so as to make them all 65ml.

my question is when i call next week to go down on my dose do i tell them what i did or not? my doctor is really understanding. he knows that i use drugs still and were working together to find a solution that works for me. i always listen to all his suggestions and i try not to be too pushy or too adamant about my suggestions. I've worked my way up to the max of 6 carries a week that we're allowed to have in Canada. I don't think he would have done that if he didn't trust me to some extent. i just don't want him to think I'm trying to screw with the plan or the system or whatever. i just want to follow the schedule that i laid out for myself since i began the taper. i made a timeline of how long my taper will take and it needs to follow a certain time frame because my parents want to go on vacation so id like to be stable on suboxone by that point and not dope sick. i kind of ruined our family vacation last year and id really like to not be that person this year.

or should i just keep this to myself and now have to measure out my doses each week so i can go down according to my plan and then i don't know eventually tell him?

I know nothing about LI - especially suffolk. I don't even know anything about NYC. I figure harlem. Issue with me is that I'm big and don't look the type one bit. I'm tall, neutrally dressed, healthy looking and clean, so in the projects they naturally think me a cop. More so, they know. I can't even buy loosies. It's a double door for a double life. But all things come with patience, and after breaking ice I'm taking two hour trips each way every three days at most. I got in through a homeless middler. He was decent enough with me, but I had been showing my face enough so that he was no longer needed. He had a good life span for a middler, and I always did right by him.

Buying from this dude in a wheelchair. No exchanges with him directly. Always via one of his stormtroopers. One of them is a skinny black kid, early twenties. I may have dealt with him once or twice before and everything was peace. This day there was something different about him, but I say this only in hindsight. I was making my way to the gas station bathroom up the street to shoot and he's following me, talking about ""let me get one of them bags."" It's not until he attacked me and I saw his face up close that i noticed his runny nose and the desperation in his eyes. 

How could he be in this position? How could I? I'm in the middle of Harlem, looking like I do, wrestling with this black dude yelling ""give me that bag!"" Why did he have to state his mission purpose for all to hear? Just fucking attack me and keep your mouth shut. People could otherwise think this is over a girl or a bus token. I come out just fine, except that I was on my way to a date with a ripped shirt, maybe some scrapes. I didn't hit or do much to him cause he was pathetic and it was a rough scene, once I shook him off right I darted towards the subway stairs. A couple people made congratulatory comments at me. I had to wait to get downtown to shoot, which I didn't curse the cruel Gods about for a moment. No cops. I'll take relocation over jail. Nothing came of the girl - pretty but fucked in the head - but isn't that a moot point?

I'm back uptown in a couple days and who do i see? ""Yo my bad about the other day, man"", all fucking nonchalants, like he gave me incorrect change. I tell wheelchair that I'm not making any exchange with this shitcake. He sends another guy, in his forties, but scrappy ""give me that bag"" cuntrag still comes with. He must have wanted to prove to wheelchair that he wasn't irrelevant. I tell the other dude all is fine as long as I give and receive from him and young gun bitchass is a mere spectator. I get the dope - looks like the right amount from a quick eyeball and I tuck it away - mediocre spot. And - 

the undercovers are on us as I've got the wad of cash in my hand. Three buns' worth. Tens and twenties all stacked in my hand. It looked so prominent it was comical. 

Right away they separate us. He searches me and he asks me what I got. I look at him and tell him the truth - all I have right now is my money. I didn't get the dope yet. Fifth pocket. I tucked it in the fifth pocket. I think he assumed that handing over the money was step one. He doesn't search my fifth pocket. I'll take beautiful dumbfuck luck over jail too. Left with the buns, every dollar, and a syrupy sweet anticipation high - looking down at the Harlem cityscape as I flew to the nearest decent restaurant with a single person bathroom.

I get 180/month and I just filled my script last week. The only  person who has access to the house is my landlord. She lives next door, and last year my SO caught her letting herself into the house when she thought he wasn't home. Since I've been unable to work this year due to medical issues, there has always been someone, usually me, at the house, so I guess I've gotten a bit lax about taking my shit with me wherever I go. We even changed the locks, but she could've easily copied them when we had to leave town for a few days and we needed her to feed our cat.

I don't have any solid proof that she took my meds, and it could've been her meth addict son for all I know, or her creepy 70's porn star looking boyfriend. I called the cops, and they said since nothing else was missing, they couldn't do anything.

So now, thanks to the piece of shit that took my meds, I'm out for the next 3 weeks, most of which I'll have to spend laying in bed because I won't be able to fucking move.

2878re,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2878re/opiate_pet_peeve_hour/,78,https://redd.it/2878re,PercoThrowaway,Opiate pet peeve hour,"Hey guys. I figured this would/could be a dope post to laugh at/cry at/cringe at/release anger at. It could be anything, ranging from ""I keep telling my little brother to quit railing our moms 7.5mg Lortabs"" to ""last time I shot up a whole gram and my nose didn't even get itchy, any way to get my tolerance down?"".

 1. My biggest pet peeve currently are the people doing opiates in my area. Opiates are fucking boooooming around here now, and it seems like most people between 15-30 have at least tried an opiate(not that extreme obviously but DRAMA amirite). I'm also known as the ""guy that knows everything about drugs"" in my large group of friends(not that they call me that, but I do a shitton of research/harm prevention for both personal use and because I know most of my friends are dummies and wouldn't look up past the first link on google). I wish I had a dollar for every person that come to me asking if they can snort/if I wanted to snort some lortabs. I try explaining to them the multiple reasons why this is a terrible idea, and yet some of them still do it lol. Or when they do whatever drugs mixed/with booze/weed/whatever and after ask me if it was okay or not...

 2. also fucking hate the itchies. I'm the only opiate addict out of my group of friends, but the majority of them have now tried hydro and oxy(i have one friend thats a semi-frequent user, think hes slipping sadly). Since I explained to them why they were itchy as shit after taking 20mg oxy they now know every time i'm on an opiate and lowkey call me out on it lol

 3. Another peeve is the fuckin dealers. A friend came from a couple hours away to cop. The dealer doesn't answer until like 5 hours later when my friend is almost home. Next day the dealer doesn't answer. The next day the dealer answers later and says 100% today.

 4, I went and semi-cold copped last night. I had to pick this dude up, find his uncle. His uncle had to go re up, so I follow him in my car. He stops at 2 corner stores to get a fucking loosie, finally drives to the trap to reup, takes 15 minutes, has me drive around the block to pick up the dude and the stuff finally. Two hour ordeal for .9

 5. Asshole fiend hydro/oxy addicts that try to middleman me like I don't know pill prices so they can get a big return from the dealer. Same dude said he had suboxone and that it was the same as oxycodone(not literally the same drug but everything else................I should of told him about sub but fuck him)

 6. This usually happens late night/early morning : nodding the fuck out(sometimes with a couple beers in me and/or some mary) in the middle of a text and it going all ""so yeah im realjhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"" on me. Or sometimes i'll nod out, eyes closed and all but my thumb will keep typing but missing all the right keys lol like ""I know right I can't wait to go up to the univershgekofelghw "". Actually nodded out writing this one no joke.

also just had a quick question : does tonic water potenate(sp) heroin(east coast powder, usually light brown) like it does hydrocodone/oxycodone/i'm sure other opiates? I'm sure it does but I was just curious if anyone knew 100% for sure and if it potenates further/less/the same.

Not opiate related but I have 0 fucking breakfast food in this house.

i'll add more as I think of em, I just wanted to get this posted. Stay safe and nod on! Go Range- oh wait. shit.


**TL;DR** : fuck you, write an opiate complaint and why you didn't wanna read my super long but **DOPE** post yeeoo

This guy just got out of rehab for heroine. He was in a hotel room alone. He was high on pills already and decides to shoot up some heroine. He ODs instantly, falling to his knees and has his head on the floor. His mom finds him there after he doesn't respond to anyone for awhile with the needle still in his arm. The final ruling said that he choked on his own vomit.

 I've got about ~20 cottons that I used to filter my ECP, and maybe 5 or so mixed in that I used for Tar. I want to not have to go early as fuck to go cop tomorrow morning, so I figured I would use these cottons as my wake up shot. Most of the time, I leave a little bit of dope in the spoon and soak it up with the cottons, and put them in the caps of my rigs, and even squirt a little bit (few drops) of dope on them sometimes. 
My question is, what is the absolute BEST way to crank all the opiate goodness out of those cottons to do a decent shot? I have just mashed them in the cap with some water before, and I have taken them out and cooked them in my spoon for a little and then mashed them up. Any suggestions?

This is my safe place lately.,"Four years ago i was really messed up. I had been working in this bar for years (started when i was 17) and the place had in-house coke and pill dealers.

I was only 20 but was allowed to drink as much as i wanted, i had a fairly serious coke habit that i supported by middling and stealing and i was taking hydros and oxys like they were gonna stop making them.

I pretty much dont remember my 19th year except that at some point i moved out of my moms and got my own apartment which allowed me to stop pretending i wanted anything but to get fucked up. And that was all i did.

One night after work i was sitting outside the bar smoking and drinking when a friend of one of the bouncers started chatting me up. She was a cute redhead, an actress, a student. She had her own car and could wake up in the morning without taking any drugs (i think id forgotten regular people did that).

We started seeing more of eachother and she moved in to my apartment after a month of actual dating. She got me clean, like really legitimately clean (except for weed but i never counted that). She made me feel good, something i hadnt felt without drugs since junior high. We got a bigger apartment, we saved money together, went on vacation (i was normal! Like a real human person!) we had a cat and a nice life.

It lasted 3 years (yesterday was the anniversary of our breakup) and the last year was horrible. She cheated, i used again (but not anywhere near as bad as before). Then we got into a very physical fight where she fled our apartment, leaving me in an electric and heatless apartment since they were in her name, and we have not spoken a word to eachother since. I had a really bad few months after that, tried and failed to overdose, gave myself alcohol poisoning, blacked out and woke up in other parts of my city with no idea how i got there. 

In the past 3 months i have gotten my life together again, i re-kicked coke and got my drinking under control, remade friends and even some new ones, i even managed to save nearly 1000$ towards a car as she took ours when she left. But im on pills again, only small dose and it IS partially for back pain but they arent prescribed.

So, today i saw her. For the first time, with her new boyfriend. She was texting and didnt see me, walked right up to me looked up and made eye contact for a full 2 seconds before walking right away. Instant panic attack, sweating and scared and i bolted and couldnt stop crying. It was really horrible and proved to me that i need some form of closure from her. 


This is already too long and im sorry but i dont have anyone to talk to and im popping hydros right now just trying not to think about the look on her face when she realized it was me. Fuck. What do i do?
