The effects of it are widespread tingles, especially on the scalp, lots of pain relief, anxiety relief, and mental peace. If I ever feel depressed, I measure out a few grams, mix it with water, and pray to god I don't taste it!

The only side-effects I experience are intense itching and nausea.

I’m a very light dope user, once every couple moths I’ll buy a couple bags, it’s super hard for me to find. I’m mostly a pothead. I have two dry herb vaporizers, the VapCap M and the Fury 2. They heat up weed and you breathe/draw air thru it and out comes the vapor. The weed doesn’t get lit on fire, it’s just “cooked”. They vape at temperatures ranging from 320-430F. The Fury is battery powered and can be set to a specific temp, the vapcap is completely analog and requires a butane torch (most efficient). I’ve done many google and Reddit searches and couldn’t find any info about doing this. I really don’t want to waste any of the two bags I have by trying this, only to find out it doesn’t work.

After jumping from anywhere between 150 to 300 mg / day of oxy, I waited until I was in full withdrawal cut off a fingernail size sliver of sub (probably .5 mgs), let it dissolve under my tongue. After waiting 45mins- hr I took another ~.5mg sliver which seemed to get me feeling “normal”. I then took a 2 mg bar of Xanax went to sleep and woke up the next day it was swollen and red face especially around my nose and my eyes. I rode out the rest of the withdrawals, being in a different country on vacation really seemed to help, especially when paws kicked in bc with a new adventure everyday, there was little time to sit around and dwell on everything that runs thru your head during paws. Anyway as soon as I returned home to nyc I relapsed (shocker). That was about 1.5 yrs ago. Now, after having 3 months clean from nov- end of January, I’m almost 8 months deep into daily use and back around 180mg/day, some days up to 240-300mgs. Need at least 150 to feel normal, plus 30mgs of adderall (especially during work week) or else I can’t even begin to do any work at all. Usually all snorted, sometimes I will eat them, but as you can imagine, this isn’t sustainable. The money isn’t even the main the catalyst behind my desire to quit. I am just so tired of this lifestyle and being a slave to the pill that I need to get off immediately. Anyone who has common experiences and can offer alternative methods or other insight it would be greatly appreciated. Also, between jumping and taking the subs, I took probably 8mg (4 - 2mg tablets) of loperamide - nothing excessive, just so I didn’t shit my pants constantly. Is it possible that little amount of lope could’ve triggered precipitated wd’s? I’d say my last “dose” of lope was maybe only 8 hours max before I took the first sliver of sub. ",1532912419.0

I once went on the roller coaster at Six Flags when I was in college and was traumatized for months (heart racing, sweating profusely just closing my eyes and imagining the first plunge).

I laugh when I imagine the sorts of risk I put myself through (od, heart infections, MRSA,...) , especially when I was shooting up multiple times a day for several months.  Yet, I was completely fearless during that whole process (even when I was messing with pure fent).   

I also have an intense fear of the death-like state you're in when doctors put you under general anesthesia, but of course, shooting up drugs is precisely the kind of activity that put you at risk for that kind of ""lights out, you're dead"" kind of death.

80mg- day 1
60mg- day 2
10mg day 3 (where it really starts)

Codiene is my thing. I've been using it very sparingly (once every two weeks or more, only 3 x 30mg tablets at a time) on a friday night to relax and chill out.

One week I was working away from home and hit the stuff every day for a week straight out of boredom. Stopped at the end of the week and experienced the withdrawal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, restlessness).

I haven't touched the stuff in over two months now. If I was to indulge myself again once every few weeks with a small amount, would I experience those withdrawal symptoms again? Or do they only happen after a prolonged period of use (like a week straight).

Many thanks! ",1532881107.0

The pain in my neck is awful and daily life is more stressful and hard. Last night I took like 35mg codiene and got some good sleep and for the first time in a long time even before I got on opiates for pain I felt happy and clear minded and I want that feeling back. If I slowly decrease my tramadol usage will things go back to normal? Will I ever be the same again and still be able to live with normal emotions. Here we’re talking maybe a year of on and off usage but around 4 months of heavy usage. After feeling true emotions this morning I’m just worried that even if I stop now they’ll never come back

We were friends with this dude when we first got into the game (me and bf). We’re pretty good at turning dealers into friends. Took him to court dates, picked him up when his crazy gf dropped him on the side of the road (worth mentioning she’s stabbed him TWICE and he’s still with her??) helped each other out whenever we could. Didn’t hear from him for over a year, turns out he went back to prison.  Meet up again, he’s got a bay now and still with this crazy bitch. We decide to try out a tester for free. He ends up throwing some xtra shit in and saying we owe $30. Which I told him to take back cause I had it before and it was shitty shit and I didn’t have money 😂 

Anyways, none of the product was good. We ended up having to take an emergency trip out of town. Should be cool, we’ll pay when we get back even though that is wasn’t the deal. Dude blows us up for 5 days threatening us and shit over $30. He’s never been this way before. I told him if he can’t calm down he won’t ever see us again, and that’s what happened. This was three months ago. 

Queue yesterday, I’m driving around town by myself and missed a road I needed. Pulled into a car dealership to turn around (they were closed for the day). Car pulls in behind me. I’m like ok cool wait for them to move cause they got me blocked in and then I’ll be ok my way. Noticed someone get out the car so now I’m thinking someone is getting dropped off, then they’ll move and I can move. 

Next thing I know this crazy bitch is on my driver side screaming shit at me about money. I’m shocked and am like, “wtf you talking bout?” He comes over laughing saying “I told ya’ll I’d catch up to you where the fucks my money?” At this point I’m like oh shit, hit my lock door button and go to roll my window up cause it was cracked. Bitch instantly reached in and unlocks car and opens in within like two seconds time. My memory is a bit fuzzy but they’re trying to reach over me into my car and trying to pull me out still screaming about money and they got a baby blah blah. For some dumb reason I’m frozen in fright mode cause I don’t wanna right some crazy bitch who will stab her own bf. They find my money and take it, I’m screaming it was only $20 they can’t take ALL my money. He takes what he wants and throws the rest on the ground. I’m circling their car to get a license plate and they don’t fkn have any AND they’re baby is in the car. I’m just like WTF? 

They speed off so I have a brilliant idea to try to follow them and call the police. Cops don’t want nothing to do with it though. Say I gotta go back to where I was and they’ll send someone to take a report or I gotta go to the station (which was coincidentally RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from where I was robbed.) I’m like you can’t just follow these mother fuckers? So I stop following them cause I ain’t trying to die over $30 I’m just pissed they got in my car and basically assaulted me when they had their BABY with them. 

So half a fuckin hour later a cop shows up. I give them details. Leave out anything about it being drug related but tell them he’s a dealer straight out of prison who should be on parole. They can’t find him in their system with the name I give. 🙄🙄 now I gotta talk to a detective on Monday. Apparently the car dealership has video evidence. I even thought of giving myself a black eye to turn it into assault but idk how far into my car any cameras can see. 

I’m just dumbfounded and shook over the whole thing. 

TL:DR; dont fuck with crazy. Also, I know I’m stupid. Im getting out of this game and trying to lead a new life. ",1532832845.0

Hell I think the public is experiencing a kind of burn out on addiction, the first time someone you know fatally ODs is a big personal tragedy. The fifth time it happens they tend to get angry at the dead friend, or just annoyed.

Subs have reached mainstream awareness, I'm seeing them used in a lot of normie mainstream memes(white trash starter kit etc). This is NOT a good thing, nothing endangers maintenance therapy more than an ignorant public turning against it. Most people still seem to think the goal of subs is to get people clean for good. I honestly think the law passed allowing buprenorphine to be RXed for maintenance slipped through during a very ""liberal"" period during which RXs of opiates for pain also rose, I doubt bupe would get through today.

I think there is going to be a BIG push for that vivitrol implant, both by the manu and by drug courts etc as its more attractive being feel good free.

The FDA is regulating freaking loperamide sales, kratom already narrowly avoided scheduling but you can be sure they will be back. The war against opiates in pain control is still grinding on.

Street ""heroin"" is no longer actually heroin but fent the majority of the time, and I see this just ramping up. Its just too attractive to criminal orgs, cheap, compact for smuggling, potent, I could go on but street H being fent is here to stay.

Yea things aren't looking so good to me, the one I'm really kind of worried about is increased regulation on sub scripts or even a rearrangement of the concept of writing the scripts as usual. Kinda terrified of no legal easily accessible maintenance med with how badly I have fucked my brain over the years, I might be resourceful but its hard to keep it up forever.

So basically, I no longer use heroin for a number of reasons, on Suboxone for 1+ yr with 1 lapse and 1 relapse in that time (best I've done in years). Ironically it was just a week ago that my household had a needle in it once again.

Anyway, I need to know the length in inches of syringes...I'm working on preliiiiminary ass blueprints for a device that, Godwilling, will make life easier for all you folks in the opiate world. But I don't work for any big company or whatever, Google et al provide me no answer, and as much as it'd seem the most convenient I'm not gonna go to the Riteaid and grab a rig just for this. If a water bottle cap or q-tip can cause that drop in my stomach, a needle will probably have me sprinting towards Philly before I can even get both my shoes on...

THUS, if anyone here has the time and would like to peripherally contribute to something that does the world good --undoing that shit karma that I and virtually all my other opiated friends have accumulated; I speak for myself, but I digress--thennn

Please find a ruler and let me know the measurements of your rigs. Specifically, I'd need to know and least how many cc/mL yours is, and also if you have the gauge and the needle length that would help as well. 
Then, the length in inches (or cm for the non-Americans on here, you're doing me a favor so I'll do the conversions myself) from where the needle protrudes from the barrel/the 0 unit mark up to where the plunger goes in (essentially, the length of the barrel).
In addition to this, I need the length between the bottom of the barrel/0 unit mark and the 10 unit mark.

These seemingly random things will actually help me greatly both to move forward with my project as well as not relapse in the process.

if you have a moment I need somebody to measure a couple things on their syringes with a ruler

Anyway tonight is my last 60mg I have and a friend gifted me 10mg of suboxone (One orange stop sign, and a quarter of an orange stop sign) I will not have access to anything for a couple of weeks and was wondering the best way to space it out.
Last time I took 1mg when wd's kicked in and I was good til about 8 hours later. My friend said my mind was playing tricks on me and with 1mg if it was working earlier then it still is.
I'd like to split these pills into 1mg pieces, then some into .5 pieces, and maybe some even lower. I know they crumble and are hard to split after 1mg so if i shaved it into fine power and snorted would it have the same effect. Mind you I'm not trying to get high.

The gloominess accentuated my wholly thunderous uncertainty in the world. 

How small I am beneath the clouds. 

The day has just begun, yet I feel the dragging monotony of the clock’s ticking hands. My place is neither with the hours, minutes, nor seconds. 

I fear that I am trapped in some timeless vacuum. Or perhaps a fever-dream. I thought that some light footwork might relieve my irresolute condition, so I paced downstairs to circulate my veins, and show me that my heart is beating. 
It wasn’t so. 

The first drag of my cigarette tasted especially harsh, forcing me to cough and my back to ache. 

My nose was runny - a combination of tobacco and snot configured layers in the back of my throat. My body felt like it wasn’t mine. I was in somebody else’s foreign figure, busting at the seams, desperately trying to get used to this uneasy stomach. 

I stepped outside to ash my smoke and water crept up my socks. I threw up. 
Nicotine and bile coated the pavement. 
True, I shouldn’t have let myself get this terribly ill. It was my spirit that needed a treatment. 

The curative self-prescription awaited me back in my dimly-lit room. 

I poured the powder from the wax bag into a badly burned spoon partly filled with water. The antidote to my aliment required some composing. I burned a match underneath, stirring gently. My fingers quivered in my flawed condition. I steadfastly sipped the serum into my syringe while cutting off my arm’s circulation with a dull rubber band. 
As I poked for a proper vein, I was already feeling my sickness subside. I pushed the plunger down like a panic-button by a bank teller being held hostage, and breathed a sigh of relief like help had come. 

My sweat curled back into my body, and my skin adjusted to feel like mine again.

I peeked through the blinds and saw sunshine. I knew my place in the world as if it was no question at all. ",1532816756.0

Anyone have any stories about ridiculous methods you went to in order to get dope while desperate? I have one from like 5 weeks ago, we always met our dealer in the staircase of his project building I was leaving in 2 days and I was broke though so me and my friends and I came up with the idea basically scare him and blindly rob him. We basically got someone we will call “the decoy” to wait 2 stories above where the deal will take place with a police scanner app running before any calls are made. We make the call and meet the dealer in the usual spot, by this time the decoy would already be in position and have the police scanner on with the volume down, we go to the spot we already knew he would tell us to come to and to call him when we where there, after arriving we whilsted to insure everything was still in place, the decoy whistled back and that was the OK. We made the call to the “Dboy” but the more that I think about it I realize he was more of a addict than a drug dealer. After the dboy arrived we said wassup dapped eachother up chatter a little and I started to count the money that the decoy gave me, he has the bundles inside of a plastic stop and shop bag he’s holding. As he usually does. Halfway through I say the code word “shit I think I ripped this one” my friend stealthy slid in front of the staircase door knob and my heart dropped... 


it was silent af and I got scared and was about to really purchase the drugs to play it off because I assumed something went wrong we hear a domestic violence call and my friend bangs on the door 2 stories up and starts running down. I panicked and the dboy did too he tried to run but my friend was in the way pretending to get his sweater caught the dealer was yelling “FUCKING MOVE” I tried to come behind them and snatched the bag ripping it a little threw it on the ground out him in a headlock from behind and tosssed him down the stairs the decoy picked it upand we FUCKING BOOKED IT out the building this all happened in like 5 seconds AT MOST It was stupid looking back at it, could’ve easily lost my life lol.

I have been using heroin for about 5 years. Now up until this March I could do a shot, (normal shot for me was about 3 points or so) and be straight for about 10 hours. That is when the WD's would start. Example: I'd do a shot at night and wake up early morning sick as fuck and in two more hours I would be in full blown WD by then. Then all the sudden in March, all the dope in my area literally turned to shit. It's like it happened over night. It got to the point where I went through several dealers and could shoot a whole fucking g of dope and not even feel shit except my WD's would sometimes calm down a little. So basically from March until this week I have been shooting grams of dope at a time just to get my WD's at bay and even then sometimes I was still left sick and uncomfortable from the left over WD's.

Well this Wednesday I did my last shot at 5pm. I decided I was done using (for many reasons). It is now Saturday at 3pm and I still feel just fucking fine. I am at a loss of words. I keep waiting to get sick but nothing. So, because of the shitty dope I have been doing, did I just somehow wean myself off it without even noticing? 'Cause remember some of those gram shots still wouldn't take all WD's away and I'd still be a little sick. I don't even know man I can't find anything online about this. I have subs with me thinking I would need them but like I said, I don't feel sick at all. Anyone have this happen to them before? or have any ideas of what the fuck is going on? Any questions you have feel free to ask, I will do whatever to figure out how the fuck I managed to cold turkey stop heroin and have no withdrawals all the sudden!

\*\*EDIT: To add that past few days I have been really tired and sleeping almost the whole day and night. I'm not even taking sleep aids. My body is just so tired I could still keep sleeping.

I'm from Europe, so using #3. I made this account because my parents, friends, and girlfriend know my main.

Today I used the vein on the very outside of your hand. It runs sort of down your pinky finger and becomes prominent and visible down at your pinky finger joint (as you can tell, my anatomical expertise is unmatched^/s).

&nbsp;


Anyway I registered easily then pushed off very slowly, so as not to blow up this small-ish vein. It still burned and I felt nothing, even though I was in, which I knew since I kept registering and drawing dark blood. **Did I miss or blow up the vein despite going slow?**


Then I gave up and switched to another new vein. This one is fat and runs along my finger, very visible, especially on the bottom joint of the finger. I registered again and pushed off; this time I think I made it because ai felt the taste after a few seconds.

How are all of you lovely individuals doing today? I hope everyone is doing well and having a great day, because each and every one of you deserve it :) 

I read a thread earlier on the dangers of opana, and read something involving how potent oxymorphone is compared to oxycodone. I wanted to know how much stronger by weight oxymorphone is compared to oxycodone, yet couldn't find any results for a direct number through searching. Of course I could find the equianalgesic doses compared to morphine of each, but not of oxymorphone to codone. SO I did some math, which I am not at all good at and really, really hated in school haha. I'm going to rip what I wrote in my comment in the other thread and post it here. Would any of you perhaps have some insight in this and tell me what I did right (if anything) or wrong? I know some of you have to be wonderful with numbers :) Harm reduction is always the goal! And I honestly love pharmacology and medicine. Even though I am clean now and have been for a little over a month, I can't help but have an interest in things like this. Not just opiates, but all medications. Considering studying it in college, actually! Anyways, thank you all in advance :)

 ""My baseline is oral morphine, which has a [bioavailability ](https://i.imgur.com/ncuvBBX.jpg)of 30%. 10 MG = 3 MG absorbed drug. Oxycodone is 1.5 times more potent by weight than morphine, which means that the 3 MG of absorbed morphine = 2 MG of oxycodone. Oxymorphone has a relative strength ranging from [3 to 7 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic) that of morphine, so I used the highest value, which converts to 428 micrograms of oxymorphone at 7 times potency in relation to 3 MG absorbed morphine.

I wanted to check both 40 MG of oral oxymorphone converted to oxycodone as well as 40 MG intranasal oxymorphone converted to oxycodone without using an opioid dose calculator just to get the relative potency of oxycodone to oxymorphone.

40 MG oral oxymorphone at 15% bioavailability = 6 MG of absorbed drug, which equals 42 MG of IV morphine at 7 times the potency. If oxycodone is 1.5 times the potency of morphine by weight, this would mean that 40 MG of oxymorphone orally = 34.8 MG of IV oxycodone, or oxycodone with 100% bioavailability.

To get this figure, I calculated the amount of available oxycodone after ingesting 10 MG at 87% bioavailability, which yields 8.7 MG. Since oxycodone is 1.5 times stronger than morphine, this same dose equals 13.05 MG of morphine and, since oxymorphone is 7x the potency, this equals 1.5 MG. So, 8.7 MG oxycodone = 13.05 MG morphine = 1.5 MG oxymorphone. From here, divide! 8.7/1.5 = 5.8. Oxymorphone is 5.8 times the potency of oxycodone by weight.

Now that I found the figure, I can directly convert. As I already stated, 40 MG oxymorphone = 6 MG absorbed drug which in turn is equianalgesic to 34.8 MG of oxycodone, so eating 40 MG of opana is not exactly like eating an 80. More like a 30. However, if you snort it, this changes quite a lot. At 43% intranasal bioavailability, this same 40 MG opana dose would yield 17.2 MG of available drug which equals 99.72 MG of available oxycodone, which is a **HUUUUGE,** and very potentially deadly, difference! So even if you snort the 40 MG, you still wouldn't be near 330 MG of oral oxycodone, which would yield 287.1 MG of absorbed drug. To get that, you would need 49.5 MG of available oxymorphone in your system, so 3 or so opanas.""",1532794254.0

Making this simple

Someone od’d in my room while I was sleeping.  I’m a heavy sleeper.  My dog relentlessly pawed, scratched, barked, and whined, until finally, she woke me up. 

She would not let me back to sleep I until I looked at him. He was visible dead or close to it. Usually I have to just narcan people be need cpr and narcan.  Anyone from here that knows me and where I live knows at this point emt and rescue would have not made it. I have saved 17 documented lives and 5-6 undocumented, so. Very use to the process. I don’t wig. I’m cool calm and collected. I stayed like this while administering narcan. However after I swore I heard agonal breathing. I was scared shitless. Thought I  lost my first one, who happened to be a good friend. 

To clarify not my first friend to die from heroin, just thought he was my first that I was working on. 

This is obvious missing many details compared to the other but should be easier to read and showcase what a good girl MJ is. 

Also shoutout to Tracey I’ve saved so many lives with kits she sent or from people she put me in touch with as has my dad who has never done Drugs

Some others and I posted earlier this week.about the crazy non-fatal overdose spike during the weekend. The bags were from a  specific popular heroin block. I say heroin block because in kenzo most of the dope is just fentanyl. This block is one of the few that still sells ""normal dope"".

Well last weekend the stamp caused at least 100+ non fatal overdoses which caused people to have some scary adverse side effects. After people were hit with narcan paramedics reported people freaking out. 

Well the lab tests just came back and the bags tested positive for Heroin, Fentanyl, and SYNTHETIC marijuana. (I wont post the name here, but all philly and kenzo people will know the stamp name, it is also listed in the article).

I havent smoked in years and have no clue what synthetic thc is like. I quit smoking because I would get extremely paranoid along with other negative side effects.

I cannot imagine what these poor souls went through that night. That is nuts. What a bunch of assholes who cut the dope. WOW!

Friend has never had a problem registering (lets say months problem free) and all of a sudden is having problems (miss after miss) no matter the spot. There have been very few successes which haven't be attributed to any factor. The vacuum method used to work in the past for them but even that is rarely working now. Before, there would be a clear register on entry and a smooth plunge followed. Now, blood only pools into the barrel when backing out after entry, sometimes it appears correctly and other times very weak and wispy. Either way there is plunger pressure/resistance which was never an issue in the past and always used to indicate a miss. However, even with the resistance there have been some successes but mostly fails. The only known thing to change before the issue began was switching from 28g to 29g but the problem didn't begin until weeks after.

92k18g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/92k18g/why_opanas_is_dangerous/,34,https://redd.it/92k18g,JakeFromSubway,Why Opanas Is DANGEROUS!!!,"There is a lot of misinformation spreading around about the dosages and the comparisons of the dose ratio of Opanas to Oxycodone, along with the various routes of administration.
As many already know, Oxymorphone is considered to be double the potency of Oxycodone; the opiate most people compare Opanas to. This is a 2:1 ratio, with 2mg of Percocet equaling 1mg of Opana. HOWEVER many people seem to leave out or completely brush over the fact that this ratio is when comparing ORAL ADMINISTRATION of both chemicals! Let me break down why this is so important:

Oxymorphone(Opana/Numorphan) has a very poor oral bio-avaliability, averaging at a measly 10-12% absorption.
Oxycodone(Percocet/Roxicodon/Oxycontin) has a very efficient oral bio-avaliability, averaging around 87% absorption. 

So a 40mg Opana ER pill is equivalent to an 80mg Oxycontin pill when just swallowing. This means that Opanas, even at only 1/10th of it's total potency, are STILL double the value of Oxycodone at near maximum potency. Why is this important? Take a look at the absorption rates of insufflation...

Absorption rate of Oxymorphone when snorted: 42%(OMFG)
Absorption rate of Oxycodone when snorted: 47%(meh)
(This is why doing more than just 10 minutes of research is important when scouting out safety information about opiates if you are a recreational user)

As shown above, Opanas have over 40% bio-avaliability when they are snorted into the nasal cavity. That is QUADRUPLE the potency when compared to oral administration of the same dose. You can also see why Oxycodone is better taken orally rather than up the nostril, with the user losing close to 50% of their potential potency if choosing the latter.

So with a bit of simple multiplication and division, here are the results: Suppose you just scored a 40mg G74 Opana ER, and you are trying to figure out dosing, but the only other pill you have had experience with is Percocets and Oxycontin:
1.
40mg Opana is equal to 80mg of Oxycodone, or double the potency, if you choose to eat your dose.
2.
Snorting 40mg of Opana is equal to OVER 160MG+ OF ORAL OPANA!!! This is also equivilent to 320mg-340mg of oral Oxycodone. 
3.
With these results, an opiate naiive person would have to snort as little as a 2mg Opana dose, and even that would be close to snorting a full 30mg Roxicodone in one go.
I hope you fools out there now understand how dangerous it is to snort Opanas when you don't have a tolerance. Comments and Feedback are appreciated. Thank you!

So, my regular connects are dry and I literally just had a ""friend of a friend"" tell me I took too fucking long to text him back. It was like, 2 minutes...and He wanted $5/ pink football xannies and I was gonna fucking pay it, too. 

That's how goddamn desperate I am.

Anyways, for whatever reason there is a huge dry spell here on opis, benzos, narcotics, subs, etc. (Totally separate and ironic story, I just found about 2 grams of super HQ METH in a random gas station bathroom today, so while Junky Jesus isn't with me today, Stimulant Santa Maria seems to be! So there's that... But I digress...)

*THE REAL QUESTION STARTS HERE:*

I have Tramadol HCL 50mgs. Probably about 35 of them. They were prescribed to my dog after surgery but she seemed to do better with the other meds she was also given. Like, every time I gave her a dose of the tramadol she'd start crying and wouldn't sit still. So, no I was not being a bad dog mom and hoarding her meds. In fact, I literally just remembered I had them and it's from almost a year ago. Just wanted to clear that up. I love my pooch. 

So, you know where I'm going with this. I've never taken this shit. I can't find straight answers online without reading through a bunch of bullshit SWIM took tramadol and blah blah. I guess it's a synthetic codeine or something and an opioid agonist, which sounds nice enough. 

So, should I take it and how much and do you think it will make me sick? Some people online saying they were just super nauseated but I always take dramamine before I do dope. Soo... Thoughts? Verdicts?

Blues were MIA for awhile so I jumped back on the devils wagon and it’s getting outta hand. I want to taper down to a manageable regimen, here’s what’s in the stash currently:

-2 grams of decent ECP with access to more

-8 pharma blues with access to more

-Roughly 250mg of liquid methadone with limited access to more of 150mg once a week

-Four 4mg sub strips and one 8mg strip with probable access to more (haven’t taken any in many years, worried about PWD)

-Plenty of clonidine, hydroxyzine, trazodone (meh) and phenibut 

-no benzos or gabas with some access to them. I don’t have any desire to take benzos but I do love gabas. Ran out awhile ago and haven’t seen anymore 

The goal here is to put down the dope for awhile and get back to where I was, not even 8 months ago I could be happily buzzed all day on 45mg of oxy. Now I’m skyrocketing into sniffing dope ALL DAY. What would you do here?

I know I personally put in around 15 hours a week modding here. Being a mod isnt fun, it's work. We get no perks, no pay, and are berated and insulted every single day. I've been threatened that I will be doxxed, that someone will take my kids, that someone will rape and kill me several times. all because I banned someone or wont unban them. Yet everyone complains how were assholes.

Ive taken what I’ve learned at rehabs, halfway houses, IOP, and 12 step groups  and found what works for me. It’s so simple but yet the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Therapy and self-awareness is my ticket to success.... to bad this all clicked last week and I started chipping the week before. FML

I've been taking it for the past 2 years now. I got prescribed an Ambien ""cousin"" drug called Zopiclone. The half life is 5 hours. Problem is, I take it during the day sometimes for anxiety and it helps so I don't want to waste them by using it for sleep. Is it alright if I take 75mg benadryl at night to sleep maybe 5 hours after the Ambien has cleared? I just don't want to go into respiratory depression and never wake up since some Zopiclone will still be in my system.

I take 10mg Zopiclone and then go to sleep 5 hours later mostly. Half life is 5 hours. I DONT have RLS . Thanks guys r/drugs wasnt helpful. ",1532738993.0

-I hate the feeling that I just caved and snorted an 1/8th of a Sub just to feel some sort of feeling, and ended up spilling some of the water off the damn spoon.

-I hate that I loved Cocaine so much, I fucked up and failed a piss test and lost my damn scripts.

-I hate thinking to myself, you don't need pills to make you happy. When, really.. Yes, I really do. Fuck sober life.

-I hate doubting myself when I managed to go cold turkey without anything all week, just to slide back in to desperation when an 1/8th of a damn sub became in front of me.

-I hate living with the demons in my head with a sober mind.

-I hate that people judge addicts and don't understand or get the concept, that some people have been through some real fucked up shit in their lives, and mentally need to numb their thoughts to deal with something as simple as bland life shit on the daily. ",1532726813.0

No problem. I hit her up on Friday but she was visiting her man in the hospital all day, apparently. He got clubbed in the head a couple of months ago, I'm not sure if he's brain dead, paralyzed or what but from what I understand he hasn't been moved from the hospital for a couple of months. Yes, I know this doesn't quite add up.. I didn't ask for more details than what I already know. 

&nbsp;

I have no idea if his condition is improving, he must be somewhat responsive to his surroundings if she's spending time with him but maybe she's just waiting for a break in a coma to get him to sign off some money, IDK this is all conjecture on my part.

&nbsp;

So I hit up that Friday and she's basically telling me later. So as it got late I ask her to level with me, ""is there a chance you *wont* be able to meet me tonight?"" I don't get a definite yes or no but the answer was indicative to me that she wouldn't be available that night. Each prior update was like a delay and an excuse. Now she's telling me ""I'm still with my man in the hospital and the stuff is at home."" I was more than willing to meet her near her house whenever was convenient.

&nbsp;

So I end up hitting up Tim and he asked to borrow $20 til Monday. He said he could give me one Zub on the spot and the other on Monday. So I took it then by Sunday he asked me if I had anything because he ran out because he paid his brother back who he owed subs to. It's tricky for me to share, I ration my subs and I think of all that can go wrong when planning. I didn't end up getting the second Zub til Tuesday. 

&nbsp;

During that weekend, I asked the girl again if she could serve me subs because hell.... although it was fishy, she never said she couldn't. Just kept deferring, delaying and so forth. Finally I ask ""what about this Wednesday"" and hse says ""Probably will have.."" but when I asked on Wednesday she said ""Monday"", the day she goes to the doctor. That's the same day Tim plans to pay me back. 

&nbsp;

I could wait to see her on Monday but I'm not counting on that. One time she told me she had a doctor appointment, said ""I'll be out in an hour."" I hit her up two hours later to set plans for that evening and she agrees. Then later I confirm them, she still agrees. Then one hour before I'd be arriving to meet her she tells me that she gotta wait a couple of days to pick it up from the pharmacy.

Like she didn't know this hours earlier? I'm guessing this is like when Cliff would get a script, send me to get it and find out he was a day early to fill it. Probably what happened to her, makes the most sense to me.

&nbsp;

So come Monday, if I count on her I'm bound to have to wait one more day. On top of that, I can't really count on her word that it'll definitely be ready when I make plans to meet her. So my best bet is to hedge my bets. Thus I hit up Tim, maybe he wants to earn a few bucks this way again. Well, he's on a higher dose.. I think 16mg per day. However, he does take his full dose when he has them on hand so there's not a lot of wiggle room. 

Basically, he wants to borrow $20 until Monday and he said he'll give me three Zubs for the wait. Last time he owed me a sub I picked it up the day after he picked up the script. This time I really 
would prefer to get my Zubs the day he gets his since that'll be the last day I'll have a dose to take in the morning. 

&nbsp;

I told and asked him four different ways and he basically assured me that he'll have it on Monday and that I would be able to pick it up before work. I'm willing to count on Tim more than the other person..... I don't really want to ride my bike out of the way on that day before I go to work but if it's gotta be done I'll do it to mitigate the risks. Such as if he couldn't meet me the following day for any reason. 

&nbsp;

At the moment I turned a four day supply into a five day supply so that I could make it to Monday. I all goes well, when I get my next dose I could continue on the lower dosage since I'm essentially beginning to taper down from the 2mg dosage. If it goes well, I may be able to stabilize on 1mg per day by the end of the week. This would bring me closer to stabilizing on an even lower dose and eventually make jumping off to be a more palatable decision. 

&nbsp;

BTW, I was seriously considering going to a real doctor. There was an issue with my pay check, I didn't get paid for three of the days I worked. Truthfully I'd prefer not going to a doctor but considering the events I just described it's an option that comes with a higher level of certainty. ",1532723434.0

Now I only do good H, and occasionally IV morphs if I cant find the brown. I take an 8mg strip every morning before work, and although I typically work 10-12 hour days, I can still get a good high going once Im off. However, I get off work early on occasion, and still been able to get a decent high going 8 or even 6 hours after taking my subs. 6 is pushing it, but I definitely still get high. Anything less than that, and the high is significantly diminished to the point where it isnt worth shooting up. Now even if I wait my typical 8-10-12 hours later, I obviously do not get as high as I would get if I skipped a day of subs (which I often do on the weekends), but high enough to not regret wasting money and time afterwards. I get a rush, high, everything. Then I take another sub in the morning the next day, and can still get high after work the day after as well. Never had PWDs from doing this either. Been doing this for almost a year, and it hasnt changed. And when I dont get high after work (i shoot up maybe once or twice during the week days, weekends are a diferent story, as I often skip the subs altogether on weekends), my subs still work all day long as they should. I know people on a lower sub dose who say they can't get high at all 24 hours or so after taking their subs. But I can. This isnt a placebo. Ive been fucking around with opiates for years. I know a good high when I feel one. Any theories? Or am I just a freak? 

Edit -I DO NOT encourage anyone else to try this just because it works for me. Precipitated withdrawals are very real, and trying to ""break through"" your subs can lead to an overdose very easily. This is just my experience, and I am sharing it.",1532712530.0

Sorry about that, I thought I was closer to you"".
LOLWAT? You can walk across my ENTIRE town in 20 minutes, let alone drive it. Thinking you are somewhere else when you've been to me dozens of times.. whatever dude. Just TELL ME how long it will be. Wasting my time is bad enough, but false hopeduring sickness is even worse.

These fuckers are laughing at us chumps as they take our money. Thank God I start subs tomorrow. Having one last blast today then onto maintenance again.

Anyone else heard any massive whoppers from their dealer?


-



Update: It took 15 minutes after he said 5 minutes for the last time.

Total time 2hr35min after being told ""5 minutes""


Weird thing was, it wasn't even him in the end. It was his runner who has been on foot all day and I saw earlier.. So what was all that nonsense about driving to me?


I've worked as a runner with another guy a while back when I was desperate. One guy drove, I handled the deliveries and the money. There was very little wait generally,  from time of calling to getting to them, in fact, we were pissed off because WE had to wait quite a few times.. I guess because customers are so used to slow dealers that they call ahead and say that they are there 20 minutes before they get somewhere so they don't have to wait.. which fucks up dealers schedules that actually organised and are on-time.

I will say this though.. we were slow getting somewhere only a couple of  times cos the guy I was with was one of those people that when he wants a smoke on the pipe or to run some lines, he has to set up all his paraphernalia, get it all correct and in order, settle into his chair, take his time, wait between each line and generally be a fucking grandad about the entire operation. 

Because he lived in the center of town in an apartment, whenever there was a break between deliveries, he would drive back there, set stuff up and sit down to do his thing. It would take 25 minutes from walking in to his first hit. Meanwhile, i've mastered the art of getting drugs into me within moments of actually getting it into my hand!


The dealer is calling us to the next location.. he never used his phone, too paraboid to answer or speak to anyone so he hands every call to me. I'm trying to hurry this asswipe up and I'm getting screamed at by the big cheese on the phone because he's getting customers call him every 2 minutes asking where the hell we are and we haven't even left.


Oh my god.. and when we did arrive at locations when there was a break in service, the queue of 20 or so people all holding fistfuls of cash and trying to be first to get served drove me to distraction. Form a line, everyone gets served... Nope, fights literly breaking out to hand us cash and be off with their stuff. I can't hear a thing over the shouts of orders ""2 this 4 that 2 boy, 3 white, 3 girl, 2 dark, 6 light.. etc etc."" All of them claiming they get discount or deals or they spoke to our guy who made a promise. We had to double check so we didn't come back short of money so everyone got more and more angry when we were slow trying to call and confirm shit. Trying to remember orders and numbers and cash values in your head, while 15 people shout numbers at you is fucking difficult too.

I had nine months clean, then overdosed and almost died in May. Woke up to paramedics in the ghetto narcanned 4x. Ive was scared straight since that day til July 4th... I shitty day at work (I work in customer service and it really fucking sucks) and had a fight with another coworker 4th of July. That night an old friend I used to live with at sober house hit me up and I relapsed.. it's my fault but I would never had gone thru with it without him enabling me and feeling less guilty about it. He's fucked tho and about to lose everything again. Hell last time I hung out with him a few days ago he casually told me he had to use a vein in his foreskin

I've been using everyday since. It's is a big open air drug market basically. For crack and heroin. I inject roughly 7 shots a day (not big shots, since the recent overdose has me extremely cautious) compulsively.

Today i was running low on dope. So I ventured to a new dopespot since I heard good things and bought 6 bags thinking it'd be the same meh dormin cut dope I always get. I go to the spot and get served at a spot literally a block away from my friends recommended spot. No. I shoot it and feel nothing. I inspect it more and it really doesn't look that different from the dope that normally is around here (dormin cut) but it could very easily be dry wall shavings too. I'm so pissed. I injected 100 ccs of god knows what in my arm. I then went to another spot later that day and got ripped off again!! I sniffed it too to see if there was anything but nothing. Different bag but same shitty drywall looking dope

I'm bout to crash and feeling sick coming on. I'm gonna be sick tomorrow morning. It's fucked because I split a bag with another addict at the REAL spot block away after i bought these shit bags and it was really good and euphoric but they didn't serve me right away. It's all these ghetto kids trying to eat a quick buck that don't really use caution and will try and sell you anything. Fuck this shit I'm so upset

In Sept 2017 my PM doc wanted ct images of the surgery site because my pain had been increasing. 

10 months ago everything was super...but the pain was putting me at an impasse.

So last PM appt on the 12th of July my doc called the pharmacy and had my meds upped without telling me.

He told me I had very little say (I mean he was trying to be helpful) and that I needed better relief.  So I boarded the oxycodone train... Now my username has lost it's zest in my eyes 😅.

Anyways, so now I'm taking that 5ml liquid every 6 hours (5mgs) and it tastes like a weird version of adult cotton candy...

So I get orders at this appt to get a follow up CT scan of my lumbar/sacral/hips.  My doc says he's interested to see the results especially of the hip area...

On the 19th I go.  I get the scan and all the while the techs are asking me if I'm in any pain and they are suuuper attentive.  A few mins out of the tube the tech walking me out says the radiologist is reading my lumbar pics...this perplexes me as to why they're looking at it so soon.  I had hoped it was a slow day at the office.

Every time I get scans I think the worst and usually they don't find anything too alarming.

This time I think that all's gonna turn out ok...fuck it if I wasn't dead wrong!

I get a call this past Monday.  My screws are loose and a fixator is in the disc above...my vertebrae has skipped 9mm and is narrowing part of my large intestine....

GREAT JUST FUCKING GREAT

I went to my surgeon yesterday.  He walks out and in and tells me they gotta open me up *again* and get the hardware out...

In 10 months I went from ok to shit

He says he's never seen damage like that without trauma occurring...

Story time!

I had posted a bit ago about being nervous to cold cop for my first time, as well as it being the first time I would have copped in a long time as I've been sober for over 6 months. Well, the day after posting that I found a person on whisper who, after having a seemingly really nice conversation about both of our struggles, agreed to middle for me with their blue connect. Drove 40 minutes to pick him up to grab 4, was going to throw him one for the troubles, but lo and behold....

He took the money and walked off.

Anyway since then I've still had that same craving, but that incident kind of reminded me how separate I am from the game even though I wasn't gone for that long. A year ago, I wouldn't have given a fuck how nice the person was; I never would have let my money walk with a stranger. I guess sobriety made me a bit naive!

Now to today. I had posted about how terrified I was about cold copping. I'd never done it while I was using before, even though I live right outside of a major northeast city that doesn't exactly make it challenging to do. I always seemed to have people who could drop it off or middle for me, and being a scrawny nerdy white dude, I just went with the what I perceived as the safest option. But considering all of those options are gone now, when the craving hit today I decided to overcome my fear and finally cold cop. I really struggled with this decision, because honestly, getting robbed almost seemed like the universe's last-ditch effort to tell me not to go back to getting high. But... well, you all understand what I mean when I say sometimes it would take more than the universe to prevent me from getting my fix. Not having money on hand today as payday is tomorrow, I went to a pawn shop and sold an old guitar, got about $70 for it. Put some gas in my car, grabbed some Newports and a pack of Sour Patch kids, and I was prepared just like old times. But shitting my pants because I've never bought this way before, and the last time my middle had gotten dope from this part of the city was the last time I got high (2 bags knocked me off my ass and into an overdose).

I take the 45 minute drive into the city, but I don't know any specific blocks to drive down, or really what to do at all. Actually, all I know is the area of the city most famous for its drug market. No more information. I'm stressing the entire ride there, not only about the action which I'm taking, but also about how little I know about what I'm about to do. Should I park somewhere and just walk up and down some streets? Should I park and leave my windows down and wait? Should I ask a homeless person like I've seen some other people on this subreddit do? I literally have no idea.

I finally get to the section of the city, and having driven through it a couple times before WAY back when I used to sell weed in my hometown for a guy down there, I get even more stressed out. I certainly don't look like I fit in, and the amount of chaos is pretty overwhelming. It reminds me of that marketplace scene in Black Hawk Down, but instead of guns being sold on the street like crazy, its dope. But I drive around and recognize a street that a couple of my friends I had met in sobriety said they used to buy from, so I drove down it.

Being pretty damn nervous, I drove down the block once and couldn't bring myself to try to buy. I did this twice actually. Both times gave me an opportunity to observe, but honestly at that point I was thinking ""they certainly think I'm a cop now.""  On my third pass, it was time to do it, because the anticipation of my first fix in so long outweighed that stress. I'm already here, it's gotta happen. And when it finally does...

I realize I'm a fucking idiot for not ever doing this earlier. It was quite literally the easiest thing I have ever done. Some dude yells ""dope,"" I give him a nod, he tells me to pull over, I get out of my car, hand him the money, I get the dope. Literally was a two minute process when I actually decided to do it.

So I've rejoined the Bropiate crew! Only copped two bags because of how nervous I was about the fentanyl, but I just finished up the second one and I'm still here! JJ has seemingly been on my side. Fire china too, or maybe just very low tolerance. Either way, I'm nodding up a storm :)

**TL;DR** I made the decision to relapse for the second time since being sober for 6 months, the first time getting me robbed. Was super stressed about cold copping, ended up being super easy and am now happy, stress free, and high as fuck :)",1532676236.0

I think I've found a way that doesn't involved chemistry and is almost free.

Now I know I will be laughed at, I have no idea of what to expect people to say to this post and idea. But here's the way I think about it: this method is much better than prostitution or stealing. So laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded, and I believe it to be far preferable to any of the other shit people do, less shameful, and more moral.

So here it is. tl;dr at the bottom.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I've been trying to find a way to make opiate use sustainable. If you could use 1/10 the amount of heroin you do now, then 1 gram that lasts you 5 days would instead last you 50 days. That takes something from completely unsustainable to very sustainable.

Now, traditional ways of using less don't really work. It's hard to reduce tolerance besides stopping using completely, any tolerance supplements usually just slow the growth of tolerance, they don't actually reduce it.

So I've been thinking hard about ways to increase the supply. Maybe you could make the half life longer? I researched that but realized it'd be too hard for the most part, there's so many enzymes and methods of excretion your body uses. But while reading about the metabolism of heroin/morphine, I found something quite interesting.

Over 90% of the heroin/morphine you inject is excreted renally (in the urine). So I looked at the metabolites.

60% of morphine/heroin is turned into morphine-6-glucuronide. 15% is turned into morphine-3-glucuronide. The other 15% in the urine is just normal morphine. The other 10% is shit out.

Just so you know, morphine-glucuronides are just morphine with a sugar molecule attached where the acetic acid is attached in heroin. The body does this so that the morphine becomes super water soluble and stays in the blood and can be filtered into the urine. Remember how sugar is super water soluble? Morphine glucuronides aren't like other metabolites. Most metabolites physically alter the actual drug and destroy it, this keeps morphine exactly how it is. Just like heroin can be turned easily back into morphine with no work, morphine-glucuronides can be turned back into morphine with no work either.

So I think you can see where I'm going with this. Yes, I am saying we should extract the morphine from our urine and re-use it.

Just think about it. Within the urine of a heroin addict is 90% of the morphine they just injected. It's extremely simple. You just boil it down, use a very easy to get enzyme that removes the glucuronides/use HCL to remove the glucuronides, and then use acids/bases/solvents to extract the morphine, then boil down until it's dry. All you have to do is turn the glucuronides into morphine, and the use PH to selectively remove the morphine. This is chemistry at it's simplest, using materials you can buy at Walmart, and it'd take less than an hour to do. Extremely simple, cheap, and fast.

Don't think the rewards would be big enough to justify it? Well look at these calculations:

Let's say you injected 200mg of pure heroin a day (sidenote, most heroin on the street is less than 25% actually heroin, most is less, meaning someone injecting a gram of bullshit street mix is actually only injecting about 200mg a day of actual heroin. Heroin is very strong, 200mg is a lot, most people here would need 100mg or less a day).

So let's say you inject 200mg of 100% pure heroin/diamorphine. If you used the urine alchemy method, you'd recover 180mg of said heroin, and would be able to reuse that. So if you used my method for all the urine you produced, you'd only be losing 20mg a day, instead of 200mg a day. (10% of 200 = 20).

Think about how powerful that'd be. At 200mg a day, a gram of pure heroin would only last 5 days when used normally. Using my method, 200mg IV a day would allow a gram to last **50 days** instead of 5. Because if you extracted it from all urine, you'd only lose 20mg a day in your shit. 20mg times 50 = 1000mg/1gram.

So instead of spending $150 every 5 days on DNM heroin, you'd be spending $150 every 50 days. Instead of spending $900 a month on heroin, you'd spend $900 a year (instead of $10,800 a year when buying every 5 days, which is ridiculous).

Do you realize how fucking powerful that is? Do you realize how sustainable that makes using an opiate? You wouldn't even have to worry about money at all!

And for other opiates it's even better. Over 95% of hydromorphone/dilaudid is pissed out. That means, using this method, a 12mg shot would last you 20 shots at least, instead of one shot. (12/100 x 5 = .6 times 20 = 12).

And if you took glucuronic acid as a supplement, I bet you'd be able to piss out 95% or more of the heroin you inject.

So with this method, you only lose 10-5mg a day per 100mg injected for morphine.

And if you extracted from your shit I bet you'd be able to use less than 1mg a day per 100mg IV, but extracting from shit is too much for me, won't do that.

All you'd have to do is collect all urine you piss out in an empty gallon jug. Then every week you go out to the woods. make a fire, and empty it all into a big steel bucket which is over the fire. Boil it down until the liquid is very reduced, let it cool, and then use enzymes/HCl to remove the glucuronic acid. Then use ph strips and solvents to extract the morphine, and boil that down until very little liquid is left, then let it completely evap using a glass pan. The morphine extracted can then easily be re-esterified into an equally potent heroin analog using glacial acetate, propionate anhydride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinic acid, etc. Easy mode, and as strong or stronger than diacetylmorphine.

And this isn't even mentioning the fun you could have using metabolites like normorphine (which could be turned into n-phenethylnormorphine). But I won't go into that in this post.

I just wanted to make this post because a couple weeks ago I created this idea, and I think it would really help people. Laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded. I want to share this free method, so that people can have a gram of heroin last them 50 days instead of 5. Basically, however long a gram lasts you, multiply that by 10, and that's how long the same gram would last you using this method (this only goes for non-fent heroin, fent dope can still be used for this method as long as there's heroin in it). If you laugh and say ""that's too complicated/weird bro why not just buy heroin?"", well I say this in return: have fun hustling, waking up sick, wasting all your money, or doing illegal and shameful things like stealing or prostituion to get your dope. This method may be weird but allows you to stop all those things, because they'd be unnecessary. 

**TL;DR** - 90% of the heroin you inject is urinated out as morphine. This can be extracted from the urine easily and turned back into an equally-potent-to-heroin morphine-ester. With this method, 90% of the heroin you inject can be reused. This means that if you inject 200mg heroin a day, you'll only lose 20mg a day.

As a result, my arms are a bit fucked. I have recently found that I can register very easily with this new technique, but it seems odd and I'm hoping someone here either uses this approach or can at least tell me I'm not fucking my arm. 

The crook my left arm has always been my go-to, but I never used this particular vein due to difficulty in the past. Looking down my left arm, this is the vein on the left (of the 2 main veins in crook of arm.) 

I have long-tip syringes, and i stick it all the way in, and slowly pull out till blood starts filling the chamber. It is clearly in a vein, the blood flows into the chamber and it's the good, dark red. I push down and inject my dope. It seems a little more painful than an average shot, but nothing like a miss. No bumps or any other signs of a miss or hit artery afterwards. 

I think the lack of finesse involved in this technique is sketching me out a bit. Is there anything that could be happening other than me getting into a vein? The blood is flowing and it's the dark color that we search for. I'd like to have my arms if I decide to get clean again.

It wasn't a lot, very little actually.    But I assumed I'd feel it.   Now all I really feel is anxiety that I wasted my one and only speedball for the month ",1532613851.0

I’m sure some of y’all can relate to this.

I’m court ordered to this halfway house at the moment and I’ve been clean for about a month and half now. It’s not so bad, there’s some stupid little rules that get annoying, but other than that I’m just working and coming back to the house everyday. It sure beats wasting away in jail.  I’ve got about another month here if everything goes as planned. 

Here lately I’ve been thinking about moving across the country when I get out. I’m from the southeast and haven’t ever really left the state I’m in. With the way I’ve been feeling lately, I think it would help me have a new perspective on life. I don’t have a SO or any kids to worry about either. 

With that being said, being sober has allowed me to look back at my life and I’ve realized that I can’t ever be content. I work out, eat healthy, have sex when I can, have a good job, and just a lot of things to be grateful for, but I wanna just run away once my felony is dismissed and start a new life. I often romance about just being on the road and sometimes wanna add being a junkie into the mix but I know that I’m not gonna be content with that either. I have hobbies like playing guitar and going fishing but at the end of the day I’m just never satisfied. 

I think about moving away for awhile and doing a gram shot and hoping my family just never finds out that I’m gone because I’d hate to put them through the pain of losing me at such a young age over my own selfishness. 

I’m tired of lacking real connection with human beings because of social media. If you’ve ever read the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, it’s about being self sufficient and being okay with the most simple things in life. I kinda want to do that if it’s possible. 

I feel I would get better feedback here than the AA/NA meetings I go to where they would say something along the lines of “pray about it” or some other bullshit. Thanks for reading ",1532612502.0

Also are there any harm reduction things I should know about I take them as prescribed but is there anything I should avoid mixing with it or even eating or drinking before taking the medication.

And now I'm paying a shitty price for all the ""not nodding"" I was doing. So I finished the pinched bag, about 3/4 a gram.

I draw up a tad more water and dump it in the cooker. Mix mix mi.... 

Oh boy. Off to the Land of Nod we go. I got half my rig in mouth, the other half in my left hand mixing. Right hand? What are you doing over there? We’re not worried about it. We are the Eternal King in the Land of Nod. Also, we’re totally great at multitasking... And then. THEN!  I hear the worst sound ever. A flutter... the tiniest of flutters, the tiniest of sounds. I wake up. 

The peaceful Land of Nod has been invaded. Armies are called to the front lines. Sirens of Doom and Destruction go off. I snap to immediately, awakened abruptly from the Peaceful and Wonderful Land of Nod.

There's one bag, unopened on the table. But where... oh god. Where is the other, freshly opened gram? My eyes drift to the table where there are relics and instructions on how to enter The Land of Nod. Nothing. Destruction? Thievery? We know nothing yet. 

I survey further down, to where my non-functioning dick sits. Oh sweet baby... it looks like Tony Montana was up on hard times and tried ravishing my dick in a coke fueled rage. There is powder everywhere. Seeped into my jeans in every crevice. Tony you shit. Take off my pants first. 

Fuck. Fuck fuck. That’ll be barely salvageable. Tony wasn’t fucking around. I continue my search further, to Lady Freya’s (my fucking dog) domain. Wanton destruction and doom. Powder everyone on my shitty hardwood floors. If you want to see an atheist pray, drop his dope on the ground. I grab the first two cards I can find, both appointments for sub maintenance (hah!) and I scoop. I scoop. I FUCKING SCOOP EVERYTHING. 

All in all, my brain and body, mortal enemy and lifelong companion to the great Land we call Nod, lost about 1/4g. I would consider that a victory. But fucking Tony Montana man, he got away this time. 

This is my stupidly embellished story that happened last night. 

Oh. And the reason I couldn’t cop a nod from the 3/4g bag, was the needles I was using were too large. I typically can’t go any larger than 29 gauge, but I prefer 30/31, as my veins are tiny. But I got 28 gauge yesterday from the exchange, and I kept fucking up my shots. I finally took my old rigs and had no issue whatsoever. So the nods happened after I slammed two .2 shots consecutively and where this story begins. ",1532602066.0

I decided to make it a low priority, just as he made it a low priority to not sell me spice in lieu of dope weeks prior. Fast forward to the other day, I texted him instead of my sub connect by accident. Immediately went ""oops wrong #"" but also said ""I trust all is well..""""

&nbsp;


Well anyway, he texted me today asking me to call him back because he had ""something to confess."" Confess? Last I checked, I'm am not a priest. So, I was curious and called him back. First it was the pleasantries, like how I was and then I asked how he was doing. He told me about work he has done on his bicycle, how he saw a video that helped him tune his bicycle's mechanical disc brakes to work better than they have in a while. I briefly shared some of my bike upgrade adventures and experience working on brakes as well.

&nbsp;

Then the conversation shifted gears a little bit. ""Ever since I've been going to this methadone program, a few months ago before I started the program, I was a bottom feeder. Like I was always the one who needed something from someone. You know, I need this and need that and ever since I started the program it's been so consistent that I don't need nobody nothing. And so it's been hard to adapt to that to not need everything from everyone. You have an idea what it's like as opposed to being oblivious to it.""



I acknowledged that it can be hard, that if one doesn't keep busy it's easy to be unsure what to do with one self and express agreement.


&nbsp;



""In all reality when things like that happen it only makes us stronger....""


I continue to express agreement.


&nbsp;



Then I asked him, ""how's your tire?"" He responds to explain, ""here's the thing about the tire.."" 


Finally, we get to the confession. 


He goes on, ""I had to do a thing for Cliff and I changed my tire and the tube ended up blowing in the new tire.. so umm Cliff gave me an idea by saying you have a junk yard of tubes tires next to your doorstep.""


&nbsp;


In other words, a couple of weeks ago at 4am on ~~Cliff's pay day~~ Cliff's mom's pay day, Derrick was tasked with biking to the ATM and then to his plug for Cliff. When his tire blew out, by Cliff's recommendation he retrieved it from the junk tire stack. 


&nbsp;

Coincidentally, I was actually planning to give that tire to Derrick. 
Originally when I was still doing dope in order to get free dope, but now just because I need to get rid of it anyway. The tire size is of a type I don't intend on using again at least not for a while. At which point I wouldn't use a derelict tube that has been exposed to the elements. It's best someone gets to use it while it's still not completely wrecked on the molecular level.



&nbsp;

No harm done, wish I could find the salvage scene on the surveillance DVR just for shits and giggle. Should I appreciate liberties being taken with my trash? Yeah, just a little bit at least but like I said it was trash. 



Then lastly, after already explaining how he has been making so much progress with the methadone program he's on, explaining how he don't gotta do anything for anyone he explains he's in a minor pickle. He only has half the money needed in order to buy a bundle and wanted to know if I wanted to get on board with an order. 

&nbsp;


I've been keeping my nose clean so it was easy to say ""no, thank you."" 



&nbsp;


#P.S. --

For those of you wither literary blue balls, for those who feel like they were struck ill and given too little dope to get straight, for those and especially for those who sat through Battlestar Galactica 1980 (the weird third season of the original) - I wish to rectify this situation. Well, actually when I hastily finalized this post that last sentence is a sign that I've made great strides towards rectifying a more important issue but y'all came here for meat and potatoes with a hint of a certain kind of non-existent (as has been argued by some) ethnic spice. 


&nbsp;

TBH I thought the included details were sufficient. Perhaps if I am to post a something so disappointing it could have been done with less words. Perhaps if it were less diluted the flavor of this post would've been enjoyable. I don't have any obligation to answer for my literary crimes but I'll try something. If it don't stick, maybe the last completely unrelated point will. 


&nbsp;


**Facts:**


* No longer am I the person who leave's Cliff's bed bug infested house at 3:52 AM with ~~his~~ his mom's debit card to withdraw money to get Cliff out of withdrawal while earning two bags for myself in addition to what I buy.


* Weeks ago Cliff hit me up to see if I would do it and said ""I'll have to send Derrick since you don't spend big on partying anymore."" At the time he expected me to clamor and say ""no wait, I will do it.. and I'll get X buns too!


* A week and a half ago Cliff called me at 9 AM (I ignored) at time I'd normally be sleeping to see if I would pick up his oxy script even though days earlier I said that I was good, well and done! In his selfish wishful thinking mindset, he neglected to remember the many times in the past when I said don't call me for anything before 11am. 


* When I used to pick up Cliff's script I'd sometimes get called if the script was ready earlier as though I was a parent in bed on Christmas morning. When I'd complain he'd be like ""but you're getting something out of it.""


* Derrick is on a methadone program. He says he doesn't need the dope anymore, he's not beholden to anyone yet he still middles in order to earn some dope.


* He once said to Cliff, ""I'd like to talk about getting a raise."" Cliff was not having it, ""if he thinks I'm going to spend all that money and give him half of MY dope.."" Funny thing, that statement gave me the opportunity to say to Cliff something along the lines of ""now you know how  I feel.""


* Derrick told me he was clean and good, that the methadone program has been great for him but still hit me up to see if I'd at least go halvsies on a bun. I don't know if I can make sense of or reconcile his words and his actions. 


* I can't really judge Derrick on the last point either, I've spent a good amount of time alternating between maintenance medication and dope before I decided to exclusively stick with maintenance. 


* These bullet points aren't going to satisfy everyone, perhaps no one.
 

* Bottom line, Derrick took an inner tube off of a junked bike that was sitting in my driveway at 4am to perform a dope run.


&nbsp;


Finally....


The main reason I posted was because I was having a hard time reconciling the way Derrick is talking out of two sides of his mouth. He says things have changed for the better for him since being on the methadone program but he's literary doing the same shit he did before - just not getting sick in between.

I walked back into the living room. I put her phone on the lamp stand next to me and grabbed the lighter to light my joint. It was easy to tell it was the good stuff by the spongey bounce it had when I pinched it to smoke. I took a few hits. That was all I ever needed. Weed had a weird way of making me feel almost like I was tripping on acid or something. It wasn’t always like that, but once I started getting hard into heroin and meth and everything else, I got weird when I smoked.

The joint Victor gave me put me there. I opened the notebook that I’d found in the attic at the job. The second story started with the title, “My Boy.” It was written in a different color ink than the story about the cabinetmaker and slightly different handwriting. It went like this:

*His mother, my wife, left in a cab at six on a Wednesday morning.* *Some of her friends from college had booked rooms at a hotel in Mexico.* *They had big plans to do the same thing they’d always done since college, drink wine, smoke pot and laugh like idiots.* *There was also a conference showcasing works by artists from across Mexico.* *That was the kind of thing my wife loved to do, so two weeks before the planned date they called my wife to see if she would be able to make it.* *We talked about it.* *Things had been stressful. I gave her the credit card, and she booked a flight on the computer.*

*While she was out of town, my boy asked me if his friend, James, could come over. I agreed.* *They’d been friends since middle school and even though they went to different high schools they remained close.* *It was Saturday morning besides.*

*I liked James a lot, but he wasn’t like my son.* *His mother went through men like they were socks.* *His father was the same with women as his mother was with men, but he also had a habit of going to jail for assaulting them.* *He’d been charged with different kinds of corporate and governmental fraud over the years, and everyone in town knew it.* *James was the spitting image of his father, charismatic and funny and talented but dishonest.*

*I caught them snorting meth a month or so before that.* *They always smoked weed which I was okay with for the most part, as long as my son wasn’t smoking it before noon and took care of business.* *Meth and heroin and things like that, though, were another story.* *I’d freaked out when I found them passing a rolled-up dollar bill and leaning over an old wooden chess board to snort lines of a crystalline powder.* *I’d watched through a crack in the door before I busted in.*

*It scared me.* *When I was young, all we had were cross tops or black beauties, which were bad enough, but I knew that methamphetamine was worse.* *I screamed like crazy.* *I sent James home that night.* *It was always embarrassing to unleash my temper like that in front of my son’s friends, but it wasn’t the first time.* *I talked to him.* *I tried to make him understand that I cared too much to not be terrified at the idea of what that stuff could do to him.*

*My mother-in-law needed to go to dialysis on Saturday afternoon.* *My wife usually took her mother to her dialysis appointments, but since she was gone, I’d promised to take her.* *And that morning, James was already over at the house.* *Things seemed to be well.* *The boys insisted on me giving them work for some money, so they could go to the movies and see some friends later that afternoon.* *I had reservations.* *Finally, I told them I’d give them 50 bucks to clean up about three years of magnolia leaves on the side of the house.* *They ran downstairs, grabbed a box of trash bags and went to work.*

*I watched from the porch for a minute.* *My son picked up a pile of leaves.* *James had a bag opened and held out towards the pile, but when my boy tried to throw the pile into the bag, maybe 50 cockroaches popped out of the soggy mess of leaves.* *There were cockroaches on their faces and down their collars and shirts and pants, a swarm of them.* *The boys spit dramatically and ran away from each other, and it took a minute for them to regroup.* *We all laughed about it, but they got it done.* *They cleaned up a major mess of leaves, which was really a much bigger job than one I could pay anyone else to do for 50 bucks.* *When they’d finished, I was just getting out of the shower and dressed to pick up my mother-in-law.*

*I paid them 50 each for their good work.* *They were filthy and said they’d shower before leaving for the evening.* *When I got back from dialysis, my son was in his room sleeping.* *He must have not stayed out long, or so I supposed.* *James was gone.* *It was suspicious, so I opened the door and listened several times to check in.* *He was snoring soundly at midnight when I finally fell asleep.*

*The next day, I started doing the math.* *If I had come home at 8:30, then he’d have been asleep for at least 12 hours by 8:30 that morning.* *It was 11:30 when I started worrying.* *That was 15 hours of sleep.* *It seemed like too long, and as soon as I opened the door, I knew.*

*Maybe it was the lack of any audible breath.* *Maybe it was a chill in the room.* *Maybe it was the innate sense within my own soul that knew his had departed.*

*The day he was born he weight 8 pounds 3 ounces.* *He cried immediately, and since his mother was out of it from the drugs they’d given her, they handed him to me first.* *He stopped crying.* *His little body wriggled in my arms, and again, there was that innate sense of recognition between us.* *I could tell he knew that I was his father, and that moment changed my life.* *That day marked the rest of my life in away not even my own marriage had, but as I stepped closer to the bed on that Sunday morning, there was no movement. I thought about the moment he’d asked if James could come over. I thought about pulling those two 50 dollar bills out of my wallet the day before and handing them over to the boys.* *I thought about his mother.*

*He was my boy.*

*And we buried him.*

The second story in that notebook didn’t feel good. It reminded me of my own father, who was a bastard, but still strong sentiment had been invoked. The weed didn’t help. Life with Gabriella was in general a desperate and miserable affair besides. She was still nodded out and standing up in the kitchen.

I grabbed her phone. There was a number half dialed already in it, probably something Gabriella nodded out in the middle of and forgot about. The number started with a 1-800. I went to her browser and found pictures of myself running across the freeway with that bag.  They were the pictures taken from the back of the Chinese restaurant by that little black guy.

It became difficult to breathe. My heart flipped. My paranoia skyrocketed. There were phases of all the emotion. First, I couldn’t even think. There was just anxiety pouring through my veins like acid and strangling me. Then, I sat up. I decided that if the cops were coming, then there wasn’t anything to do about it. They’d come and get me. I’d serve my time. It couldn’t be any worse than life with Gabriella, but then, I wondered if she’d even got a phone call off. If she was nodded out and left the meatballs burning on the stove and the number was only halfway dialed.

I looked back at her phone and smoked a cigarette. It showed me walking out of Home Depot from the security cameras. And a different security camera outside of the store showed me coming up off my feet to clock that loss prevention guy. The rest of the photos were of me fleeing across the freeway and the cars wrecking.

The article was short. It talked about the Home Depot employee being listed in critical condition with trauma to the head and those who had been in the car wrecks had suffered minor injuries. There was a large reward for information that lead to my capture. I pulled on my cigarette. The nicotine laden smoke rolled over the back of my tongue and sank into my lungs. This was no big deal. If I kept her plenty high and supplied until we could get out of town in the Focus, it would be okay. I would ditch her somewhere after all of that.

Gabriella remained stuck in that position in the kitchen but for the slight bounce of her body waking up for a millisecond and nodding right back out. I walked past her. In the bedroom, sleep came easy. A terrible vision woke me up in the middle of the night.

Across from the bed right in my line of sight was myself but not just myself. You know the way dreams make characters out of weird blends of the different people in your life, like someone in your dream might be your third-grade teacher and your mom simultaneously, and its hard to tell where or when they or if they even are divided from each other in your dreams? The vision I saw was half of myself and half Rufus, but the evil orange glow of the eyes and voice belonged to something else entirely. Something from somewhere else. My head had been severed, and the figure held it by the hair so that it could address me. He spoke.

“Clyde? You’re going to let her do that to you?”

“I guess.” My lip quivered. The image was terrifying.

“She was going to turn you in! Where’s the Clyde I know? Where’s Boom Boom? Has he gone soft?”

“N-n-n-n-n-o-o. Boom Boom?” I had forgotten all about the nickname. My life on the streets with Rufus existed lightyears from where I was then in that bed at Gabriellas. Now I was soft. The evil entity speaking to me from the dark was right.

“You let her fart in your mouth?” It was true. I remembered. I hadn’t told you yet, because I was embarrassed about it. But I’ll spare the details of what exactly we were engaged in that allowed her to squeeze one of those wandering ghosts out of her wheezy colon and directly into my mouth. You can probably guess. Whatever that was talking to me though, he already knew.  “She farted in your mouth Clyde.”

“What am I supposed to do?”

“I don’t know. Here’s an idea.” With its other hand, the figure pulled a 2x4 with seven or eight nails sticking out one end of it. It was a crudely fashioned murder weapon. “I’ll leave it here for you.”

Winter sunlight coming into the room the next morning gave me some peace. The vision of the man holding my head and talking to me from the netherworld about murdering Gabriella was just a dream. I could go about my day. My imagination had gotten the best of me, but when I pulled my jeans off the chair across from the bed, the chair the evil being had been sitting in, a 2x4 fell from behind it. There were nails through the end of it. I slipped my pants on in the kitchen.

Gabriella was stuck in the same position. That was a long nod. I figured she must have had some benzos or something, but before I woke her up and talked her into leaving town in a hurry, I pinched the fold of bills in my pocket. It should have been 200 for the drills plus another 130 after working with Vic the day before. It was enough to get us high and out of town.

“GABRIELLA!”

She startled. She stood up and screamed at me for a minute but didn’t make any sense. I held the cash in front of her and said,

“Let’s get high. I wanna get out of town.”

“Why?”

“Baby. It’s just time. I got some hook ups down in Florida. We can get some good stuff and live the good life on white sand beaches.” It was a lie. I knew no one in Florida, but the sands were white, at least in some places.

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah, babes. Let’s just get 100 bucks worth today. I’ll put some gas in the Focus. We’ll bust out of town, baby. It’ll be great. Just you and me. What do you think?”

“Hmmm… I guess. I haven’t been on a road trip in a while. It would be nice.” She was still wiping her eyes. Gabriella was usually sweetest before she did any heroin in a day, so long as she knew some was coming quickly. “I’ll call Dominic. He’s up early and has good stuff. Do you have my phone?”

“Okay. Yeah. Here it is. Before we go though, I gotta see my sister. I’ll call her on the way to Dominic’s. Maybe we can meet her at Wendy’s or something.”",1532578033.0

The other thing is my relative is going to have a meltdown. Seriously, OCD, bipolar meltdown. I don't know if I should tell her now or wait until I find out the results of the test. She has some of my pills now. I should switch our rightful Rx's ASAP so she doesn't have the misfortune of getting tested with the Hydro.

I know my question is do the doctors call or send a letter? How do they let you know? How fast will I find out? Are they going to question where the other Rx came from? Am I going to get blackballed in my state? Yikes! I just wasn't thinking of the consequences of doing this.

Now I have several days off and I'm wondering if I'm in the clear of withdrawl symptoms or if I should bite the bullet, quit the kratom and deal with withdrawl (if it even happens). ",1532550275.0

It's been 36 hours and I'm still not sick yet. I've been sniffing street dope for four plus years and this is my first experience with morphine. With the street dope, I get sick around 24 hours, so I'm thinking it has something to do with purity. I could totally pull something out of my ass as to why it's taking so long for me to get sick and probably be at least on the right track, but I'll turn it over to you all for an answer that would be anything more than a guess. Just really curious why this is so different. It's surreal to me that I'm not in agonizing pain or sweating yet.

The only reason I've thought about dope is because it feels weird *not* being high for three days, not due to cravings related to sickness. The thought came and went and I feel fine again. Last time I tried kicking, I didn't get very sick at all. I had some methadone for the first time then took suboxone when I started feeling a tiny bit uncomfortable later on. Ended up just not even taking any more suboxone after that because nothing happened. A leg kick here, a stretch there and that was it.

Your mom was sitting on my bed, watching as I busted down a pill and begging me to give her a line. Your dad was in my living room and had cut her off since you would be arriving in a few weeks. We all suspected your mom was still snorting oxy, but she always denied it. She had tears in her eyes, pleading with me for just one bump, saying that your dad cut her off cold turkey. She promised me she hadn't touched anything else, as I heard that she used to pop Xanax all day long before I met your parents a couple months prior. That moment was the first time I failed you. Knowing that cold turkey withdrawal was not good for a fetus, I caved in. Your mom agreed to keep it our little secret. She stood up from my bed, eager to grab the straw from my hands, her eyes focused on the size of powder I was pushing to the side for her, when I saw you move. Her entire stomach shifted from left to right. I placed my hand on you, amazed at how strong your movements were and how quickly you danced around in her abdomen. 

I remember the first time I met you. At two weeks old, you were absolutely beautiful. My puppy laid at the bottom of the swing you slept in, guarding you like you were the most important thing on this earth. And to your parents, you should have been. I brought you over a small gift, as I assumed people do when meeting a new baby girl. Your mom tossed it aside after peeking in the bag. I got to hold you tight on my chest as you slept, in awe of just how beautiful you were. Your dad had gone on a run with my boyfriend, making a couple bucks off of our habit, but I was more excited to meet you and asked to stay home with your mom instead of tagging along like I usually would. You had that new baby smell, I breathed it in until it was overpowered by the smell of cold air and cigarettes. It was middle of winter, but your mom needed a smoke break after hiding the plate she used to snort her lines off of under her bed. Instead of speaking up as she opened up the bedroom window to blow her smoke out as you sat six feet away from her, I kept my mouth shut. Fear of pissing her off, I failed you again. 

Over the next couple months, we met a handful of times. Never for too long as we saw your parents mostly for one reason only. You were growing so quickly, a chunky little thing who had learned to smile pretty early. At three months old I saw you one night. We met your parents at a local gas station for my brother in law to meet up with your daddy. Your dad was slurring his words, barely able to keep his eyes open. We asked what he took, he mumbled something incoherently about how many bars he had left. My BIL walked over to the car. Your mom was slumped with her head between her legs, cigarette in her hand. He tapped on the window and she shot up, hiding the cigarette quickly because you were in the backseat. Bundled up to fight the cold air at 11 at night, we did our best to not fail you that night. We called your aunt to pick you up and take you home. We waited in the cold until she came for you, angry that we were getting involved. I got home that night and cried for you. I cried to my boyfriend the next day, worried about you. We went back and forth weighing the pros and cons of getting child services involved. Your parents lived with your grandparents, so we knew you would always be well taken care of as long as you were under their roof, but that wasn't enough. They couldn't watch you 100% of the time. They didn't stop your parents from taking you out all night while they drove around dropping off orders. 

But I never called. I have no excuse for failing you. I single handedly could've changed your fate sweet girl. I wonder today what could have been different if I had. Would there have been an intervention? Would you be in a better, loving home? Would your parents have gotten clean? 

The story given to family and friends was SIDS, but I was told what really happened the night you left this earth. I hope you know you were loved by your family. I hope you know you were loved by distant friends such as us. I hope your last moments of life were nothing but comforting. I know you were asleep in your parents bed, I know they both were high on Xanax and god knows what else that night. I know that they blame themselves for your death, as I blame myself for not doing my best to make sure you were safe. I still think about you all the time, I look into my own baby's eyes and think of yours. How you deserved better, you deserved longer. You deserved to be protected. You deserved to be safe. You didn't deserve to leave this earth after only spending four months on it. You didn't deserve parents who prioritized a nod over their newborn. 

I'm so sorry I failed you sweet girl. ",1532543412.0

A friend of mine said my body was shaking or whatever and I was drooling. He held me down as i was lying on the stairs. He was freaked out so i didn't ask any questions. 

Idk if that was a seizure. I have no memory of any of it and felt fine, maybe a little tired. I didn't even realise i had any missing memory. My friend said that i spoke to him after and said no to him calling an ambulance and that i had my head between my knees. I don't remember talking about it or him on the phone with emergency services. I refused to go to hospital and cancelled the ambulance. 

What exactly happened to me? Idk what seizures really are or even if that was what i had. My friend kept going on about something like ""grand mall"" but because he was so freaked i didn't ask him. I have looked online at seizures but i don't have epilepsy. I didn't piss myself either.

So, I have read that the -azole class of antifungal drugs is an extremely potent CYP450 inhibitor, thus one would would think it therefore is an opiate potentiator. Even my pharmacist warned me of mixing this with my Rx oxy and highly recommended that I reduce my dosage as it increases blood concentration levels. This excited me in that my Rx allotment is extremely minimal and I already had been seeking out the best ways to stretch it as I do indeed have an unfortunate tolerance. 

Tried this combo today, and much to my dismay, I actually felt a DECREASE in effects of my daily dosage. I feel like I took nothing at all, hours later. Needless to say, I’m not happy about this. I read somewhere online that though CYP450 inhibitors may increase blood levels and leave the drug in your system longer - that they, on the other side, reduce the amounts of feel-good metabolites? Does anyone know anything about this? As a newbie to potentiators (I’ve only tried DXM thus far, which also didn’t do shit), what should I try next?? I’ve read about Tagamet but it seems that operates on CYP450 as well? Is my body just weird?

I love my mom, my family.... who am I doing this to them? I chip pieces off my shoulder each day to stay alive and still die by forty and have my own family bury me and watch as the dirt covers me. How could I do this to them? They loved me my whole life and this is the way I repay them.

Sometimes, almost always actually, I hate myself and who I am and wish more than anything that I could change it all. 

Sorry for the stupid rant, just hating myself today.",1532527961.0

Also it was to be right after we got off work.  We didn't want to but then he offers us a 16th. Of course we hastily agreed but wanted to know how/why he was offering so much. Well, he says he's going to reup off the plug and there may be a chase and there was a very small chance of gun play. The plug is high enough up that he's got 10+ guys who work under him and he always carried s gun and was known to follow through on violent thrrstd.  

Well I had reservations about this. I have a lot of empathy for way more people than I should but ripping this guy off felt more to me like stealing a candy bar from Wal-Mart than ripping off a real person. I did however worry about how this would all go down and also riding in the hood at 2am. The plan was to trade this guy a fucking bb gun for the ball. No shit, a fucking bb gun. It looked real if you didn't examine it closely or look in the barrel. Also it had almost enough weight. That being said it'd take a fucking moron to go for this. Just the dumbest idiot ever. I said so. I thought we were going way out of our way to, best case scenario, look like the most pathetic of fools.

We got to the spot in the city and these fools keep being so obviously shady. They tried to park on the side of the street instead of the parking lot. Luckily I was able to talk then out of this and more dumb shit. After the typical dboy ""wait a min"" ""almost there"" ""actually meet me at this other place"" he finally got to us. Lo and behold he sent one of his guys! The guy looked new to the world of crime and paranoid and his dumbass got out of his car and walked up to ours. He looked really paranoid and kept looking around. He/his boss had been told he had to get the gun in a bag bc someone in the car couldn't know about the gun. Well, the guy accepted it and the exchange went np. My dumbass cuz still peeled out anyway. I'm certain this guy wasn't going to check the gun out any time soon. He was just an errand boy. We made it away and cuzs friend got many pussies texts and calls but he gave us half of the very short ball and it's good quality ecp.

I hate being involved in ripping anyone off though. Thankfully it was a higher up guy or a civilian. I hope the poor errand boy didn't get reprimanded too harshly. We're otw home now. How's everyone else night?

Just wanted to vent about my poor, dear friend. He just OD'd a few weeks ago and didn't make it. He was the smartest guy I ever knew, a genuine genius - without a doubt could've gotten a PHd in Maths / Physics (but prob Maths) from any university in the world - just didn't care to take that path (think *Good Will Hunting*). He came top of his school (academically the best school in our city of 2 million) while being drunk as fuck for his final exams. He went to university for a semester or 2 but decided to drop out to be a game designer for about $100k as an 18 year old about 20 years ago ... so shittons of cash.

His younger brother (of 3 in total), who had a few demons in the head, OD'd and died about 10 years ago. He was a sweet kid, but we teased him and were unkind to him when he was younger. I'm so sorry.

His youngest brother was a little scamp who made everyone smile. Perhaps led astray by his brothers, perhaps on his own, he became quite keen on the drugs and died of an OD about 3 years ago. He had a young son.

I'm just sad is all and wanted to tell the cliff notes of this sad tale. I feel so sad for their parents, what more do they have to live for? Poor people, they had everything, plenty of $$$ (I mean plenty), 3 brilliant sons, respect in the community; and now it all has gone.

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job. ",1532490506.0

So potent, I fucking OD'd.

Only, it took my a few minutes. I untied and rushed downstairs to do chores. I washed a plate and my girlfriend's mom said something to me (she was over) and I realized something was terribly, terribly wrong.

I couldn't see.

I could hear her words but it was just babbled nonsense. The *whomp whomp whomp* you get in your ears with a rush was overpowering. 

I thought it had been 10 minutes. It was less than 15 seconds. 

I knew I couldn't just die in the kitchen. I had to get upstairs.

""I'll be back,"" I stuttered, not even looking at her mom. I clawed my way up the stairs as fast as I could. I threw myself in my bed. I nodded off.

My gf knew something was up when I didn't come back down, so she woke me up. I could hardly think or swallow or breathe. She pulled my head up out of the sheets and said: ""you seem like you need a back rub.""

that was the best fucking back rub of my goddamn life. I had her stabbing me with her elbows so hard it left mtherfucking bruises. She rubbed my back lotion and all for 2, 3 hours. I remember 30 seconds of it.

This guy is a proper yardy, I'm in south London so you can imagine the type. Now, I'm quite openly gay, I'm not particularly camp and I don't actually look gay to most people but, I will talk about it.

So this dealer knew and it comes to one day where I buy some gear of him and I'm smoking a bit of the white in the park. He's stood next to me, we're just chatting because supposedly he's waiting for someone. Next thing I know, he grabs my hand and puts it on his dick. I'm like 'What the fuck, Marcus man!' and he's like 'Go on James, touch it, go on.'

Basically, I'll spare you the details but, we went back to his house around the corner. He gave me a bunch more Cocaine, that I smoked a load of whilst we was doing the dirty, and then he gave me some more Heroin. Now, I'm a bit confused about how I feel about this.

He is actually attractive to me and I would have done it if he was just some guy on grindr or whatever. But, it just feels a bit strange to have done that with him. And I feel like it might happen again..... Which, I don't know how I feel about that either. Because, it's a very easy way to obtain drugs and I did enjoy it but, I don't know if I want that to be a thing I do.

Anybody got any thoughts? Anyone been in a similar situation? Any comments? I'd very much appreciate it. Cheers in advance :)",1532444784.0

I use subs to help chip, but do not have a script for methadone or suboxone. Nor am I implying the hate is on this sub, or not on this sub, but the internet at large. For those of you who think that using Done or Subs isn't being clean, hear me out.

If the sole definition of being clean was to not be taking any sort of narcotics regardless of circumstace then yes, maintenance is not being clean. 

But to me, when we use the word clean around here, it's so much more than that. Its about living a clean life, having a clean house (and because you want a clean house. Not just because you're high where you could be cleaning up pigeon shit and feeling great), having clean relationships, clean clothes, a clean nose, clean skin, a clean outlook, clean relationships, a clean diet, clean eyes, fuck, a clean car! 

It even gets me down when people say ""yeah, I know I'm not clean, but at least I'm not using heroin anymore."" Fuck that! No one on here picked up an addiction simply so they could fuck up their lives and post pill porn on this sub. They did it as a form of self medication, whether it was for physical pain, emotional pain, general life pain. Its just like any other medication, be it anti-depressants, bipolar medication, schizophrenia meds, blood pressure meds, and any other sort of meds. 

You have to go through a few until you find the right one. If one of those meds happens to be diamorphine laced with fentanyl, than so be it. But to those who end up on the right one, be it methadone or suboxone, and that itch that you first tried to scratch with opiates is still satisfied, but you're living a sober life, good for you. Truly good for you. I just dont see how its any different that if youre just as clear headed as someone taking SSRIs, or any other meds you that you need to function day to do day, why you should feel even the tiniest bit guilty about that. If you come out the other side as back to being the person you loved before your addiction, with the added empathy and life experience that someone who goes through addiction can acquire, than you might even be in a better place then where you started. If 1 year, or 5 years, or 20 years of addiction means you come out the other side a better friend, a better partner, a better father, or sister, mother or brother because you now have a true appreciation for life, don't let anyone take that from you. At least you can spend the rest of your life being the best person you could ever possibly be if you just look forward. 

So to all of those out there who hate on people on maintenance, fuck you, but more importantly, to those who feel like they still haven't succeeded because they're still on some form of maintenance, stop right now. You were able to feel that euphoria and put it behind you. You da real MVPs

Drug tests twice a week. The first few days I got out all I had was subs which helped psychically but not mentally, they also show on the 10 panels I take. So I went through those quick and started taking Kratom every day. It's helps a lot, better than subs IMO but I still have the urge to use the needle and dope. The needle fixation resulted in me shooting etizolam in PG solution which believe it or not is the closest I've felt to shooting dope albeit for like 30 second and not a rush you can even compare. Just the instant depressant relaxation. I've continued to do that for a while and still am. It helps with the craving of the needle itself. Anyways to the point.. It's been a little over a month since the end of my 3-4 point per day IV habit and I have access to quite a few 50mg tramadol which I could trade for just a couple bars. At this point would it be worth it? Is my tolerance low enough? Or should I just stick with Kratom?

So the veins in my arms need a break, and at this point so do my hands. I got these really tiny rigs (50 units and a 6mm needle) from the exchange near us so they're great for small veins. Question is: when I hit in certain veins near the top of my middle knuckle (so on the finger itself, not where it joins the hand) I get a register and hit slowly and it barely hurts, but it irritates my finger to the point where it's difficult to use for a few days. I still feel at least some of the hit though. But if I hit in the vein to the side of that knuckle, there aren't hardly any consequences. The obvious answer here is: just use the veins to the sides of the knuckle, but finding a register there is difficult whereas hitting the top of the knuckle is virtually an instant and guaranteed register. Is there any reason for this difference? Both of the veins are fairly thick and I inject very slowly using a clean needle.  I'm also shooting tar by the way.

I wanted to, but it was hard to find a place to put it and as it was, there were too many elements that were too difficult to tie together for me to make it work. So now I have a chance. Most of it you have never heard, but there are some things with which you should be familiar. For instance, you might recognize where it starts.

It starts in that second-floor studio in that white washed adobe building across from the jail. The one my mom paid rent for over the phone, you remember right? It smelled like hot metal. It’s where I dated that red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over to see me hours before she ever showed up. It’s where I met Danielle. I’m sure you remember her, but now that I think about it, I don’t know if I ever told you that it smelled like hot metal. Anyway, now you know. It smelled like hot metal, and it was miserable.

So, this dope dealing couple had lived there. Bo and Angel. That’s how I knew the place existed, and I had even tried to sleep on a pile of clothes on the linoleum floor with cotton fever there once. But they got kicked out, for several reasons, but one in particular was the morning that I sat on the stairs outside going up to the apartment.

The landlord owned and ran a local fast food place called The Chow Cart in the same parking lot. He saw me sitting there. His customers and employees saw me too. He didn’t like that. My friends told me later that he specifically mentioned that morning that raggedy bum sat on the stairs outside of the apartment when he was kicking them out. It looked to sketchy. He said it looked like they were selling drugs or something which they were.

But when I came along, six or seven months later, the old man had forgotten that he’d ever seen me sitting outside of the apartment or that he disliked my appearance there so much that he kicked his tenants out. He didn’t know that it was me. It must have been the crusty black scabs on my face that made me hard to recognize. They were a significant change in my appearance, or maybe it was the fact that the place had been for rent since he kicked Angel and Bo out and needed money. Either way, he let me live there. His son sat me down at one of the tables in the restaurant and went over a list of rules that we both signed. Then, he gave me the key and took me up to the room. It was miserable, like I said, but there was a TV left behind and free cable and a dusty love seat that came free with the place. Sleeping on that love seat did irreversible damage to my spine and neck, and when I woke up at 4 every morning dope sick and in pain from trying to sleep on the love seat, the Jersey Shore would be playing in marathons in the freezing predawn dark. A combination of the sickness and depression and the absurdity of the Jersey Shore burned the audio forever into my mind and emotions. The damage has been irreversible.

It only took the old man two weeks to realize that I was the same story as Bo and Angel, except maybe I was a little more desperate than they had been. I stole the coffee can of gravel my downstairs neighbor kept outside of his door and used for an ash tray.  He was the landlord’s nephew and manager at the restaurant. That never looks good. Even Bo and Angel hadn’t done that.

Anyway, the old man told me I had to go in the parking lot between my building and the restaurant one morning before it opened. He found one of his customer’s wallets in the snow while we were talking about it. He was an honest man. I tried to talk him into giving the wallet to me as if I were somehow better suited to take care of it and make sure his customer got it. I don’t know what I was thinking, but he seemed horrified. Danielle and Mike came over to help me move out a few days later and stash the TV in the snow behind a store. I left the place spotless, literally. I crawled backwards out of the place with two rags wiping up my foot prints as I left.

Now, when Bo and Angel moved out of that same apartment the spring before, they ended up living with this couple in a double wide on the south side of town. We’ll call this couple, Gary and Cherry, to protect them or whatever. I remember when Angel told me about how nice Cherry had been to her on the phone before they moved in. I imagine the conversation went something like this,

“*Oh, Cherry, you know life’s so crappy.* *We’ve just endured (insert long list of unfortunate circumstances associated with severe heroin addiction and dealing, like: losing your place, getting diseases, losing another place, getting robbed, being sick, getting shorted by your supplier, the dope’s no good anyway, getting evicted again, etc.).”* This is my imagination of what Angel said to Cherry. That’s why it’s in italics. It seems plausible, but according to Angel, Cherry at some point actually said,

“Why don’t you two just come home.”

Angel recounted this to me with emotion conveying some sort of sincere love or familial bond between the two couples, especially her and Cherry, but I always recognized this kind of thing as totally bogus when I was addicted. No one loved anyone in the game. It seemed like things with Gary and Cherry might sour quickly for Bo and Angel in my opinion. And they did.

Within a week, I think, Gary had put so much pressure on Bo to give up so much dope for free, even though they were paying rent, that Bo and Angel left. Both couples could be heard around town talking terribly about each other. It was just like I expected, and however keen I had been to predict how things would go for Bo and Angel with Gary and Cherry, I was completely blind about how it would go for myself.

Gary was from Louisiana like me, but from the north. He had long blonde hair and snake eyes. I always thought he seemed like someone you see on those real-life murder mystery shows where some guy does something so heinous that no one can believe it, killing his family or whatever for insurance money.

He met Cherry some years before, I don’t know where, and he identified the tattoo on her hand as the symbol for Nibiru. They both loved Zechariah Sitchin. They knew all his books. They believed we were created by an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who bred their DNA with that of apes to get us. Our purpose was to mine gold for their atmosphere, which helped keep the heat in while it made its 36000 yearlong orbit around another star and our own sun.

Cherry had a big saggy belly and buck teeth and thick, thick glasses. She had two boys from other men.  They had Gary for a stepdad and Cherry for a mom, both shooting heroin, meth and cocaine in the back room and screaming at them for trying to talk to them. That was their life.

After getting kicked out of the very same apartment as Bo and Angel, I moved directly into the very same double wide that they moved into after they got kicked out. I lived in the small room between the living room and bathroom at Gary and Cherry’s place. It was okay at first. They helped me get around to rip people off and the different things I used to do to come up. I had some money. They had some money. Our favorite dealers got caught with a bunch of guns and dope and an underage cousin at their house, which really sucked, so we made a deal amongst ourselves to quit. We would get well one last time and on the first, which was fast approaching, Cherry would see her doctor with Gary. Between the two of them, they would get Cherry’s Clonazepam prescription upped from 60 one milligram pills a month to 90. When they went, they got it upped to 90 two milligram pills a month. We were in heaven. I got 30 out of the deal. Kicking was going to be easy.

Another thing I forgot to say was that the little Chevy Blazer they drove around in had no brakes. It had, until the day we planned to kick and got the huge order of Clonazepam, worked for us. There had only been one incident where we tapped a guy’s bumper at the gas station. He didn’t care. That morning though, we got back to the trailer, took our pills and once they set in, we decided we’d get high just one more time. I mean, what’s the point of having so many powerful benzos on hand if you can’t slap a thick tar shot on top of it to get you good and high? You know what I’m talking about. So we headed in the brakeless, green Trail Blazer to Walmart to meet Bo in his golden 4Runner with the back window busted out of it.

While we waited, I ran into the store and stole two of the big boxes of Mike and Ikes, the regular green box and another one of the tropical variations, I can’t remember. When Bo showed up, we got high. I put a loaded rig with the rest of my dope in the green Mike and Ike box, folded it at the top and placed it in the door. We took off towards the back roads. Between the large dose of Clonazepam, however much Gary took, the shots of black we’d just done and not having brakes, Gary almost swerved off the road and then almost hit a cop. The cop turned around. We said there was no dope in the car. They searched it anyways and we ended up in jail.

We were being charged with felony possession. The guards beat me up and shoved my head in the crap hole in the padded cell for talking too much crap. I had nightmares, sweats, sneezes, all of that good stuff. After two weeks, the morning we were supposed to go to court, they come hand Gary and me a piece of paper each saying the charges were dropped. Gary called Cherry. Cherry had written a letter to our judge who had known her since she was a little girl and rode motorcycles with Cherry’s dad. It’s a small town there. They let me go, but it was a known fact that he’d planned and helped execute the escape of three other prisoners only months before. The DA couldn’t prove it. They’d come up with some other bogus charges and held him for three months. I walked.

That’s when I called Danielle, and she’d been held against her will by Mike and all that. But before we ever went to Justin’s or any of that other stuff, she and I went to Cherry’s. Cherry had taken my 25 pills and put them in her nightstand. She said I could have a few. I took 25. She got mad, and that night Danielle and I had loud and obnoxious meth sex until daylight. Cherry didn’t like that either. I found out she had been manipulating my parents, telling them that I’d caused her husband to go to jail and left her and her kids with nothing for money or food or electricity or any kind of transportation in the middle of winter. It wasn’t how it had happened. While I didn’t mind manipulating my parents for money or doing them wrong myself, I really despised the idea of her doing it.

While I still had those pills and was doing meth with Danielle, I would go into bouts of dementia where I’d talk nonsense and not know where I was. Cherry wanted to get back at me, so she called my dad and put the phone in my hands in the middle of one of those episodes. I was saying something about Snoop Dogg, when I heard my father’s voice,

“Riley! Riley! What’s going on? What are you talking about?”

I snapped out of it enough to realize what was happening. Fat Cherry stood smirking at me in the hallway like she was waiting for a train wreck to happen and couldn’t look away. “Nothing, Poppa. I’m good.”

“You don’t sound good, Riley.”

Anyway, you get the point. It was ridiculous. After that Danielle and I would park outside of her bedroom window late at night and talk loudly about all the heroin we had and the Clonazepam we had and have loud and obnoxious sex until daylight. Danielle hated Cherry too.

By the time Gary got out of jail, Cherry, who was a 42-year-old woman, was in a relationship with my 17-year-old friend we called Tweaker Bird. They were completely in love.  Gary says he never knew about that or didn’t care, but when he and Cherry went out into the desert one night. They started a fire in a trashcan inside of an abandoned trailer. It was a bad idea. Cherry burned to death inside of that trailer. No one knows if it was Gary or not, but he’s never been to jail for it. We just know he was there. That was years ago.

Anyway. That’s the story I wanted to tell you. Maybe next time I’ll tell you the one where this old lady shot her great Danes in the head for no reason and paid my friends 60 bucks to cremate them.",1532400728.0

It is currently in phase III trials by Depomed.

Sorry but I need to get it off my chest and there are parts I can’t tell anyone...,"This could probably cross post between here and /chronicpain but I’d rather keep it here I guess. A bit of history: I’m a retired (female) firefighter/paramedic. I got hurt on the job and got a medical retirement about 8 years ago. I have been in Pain Management ever since. I have procedures pretty regularly like injections and stuff like that to help control the pain. A couple months ago a procedure went wrong and I ended up with a pretty serious spinal cord injury. I’m working hard to learn how to walk again. 

I have always done well with people. I’m pretty outgoing and funny (if I do say so myself) and I’m decent looking. I got a lot of attention as a female firefighter, my body was amazing because if how physically demanding our job was (when we weren’t sitting on our asses at the station playing video games when it was slow, lol). When I had to retire I went thru a serious mourning period. I felt like I had experienced a death. 

Over the last 8 years I’ve gotten passed that depression and started feeling good about myself again. I focused on taking care of my kids and husband, and dove into taking in rescue dogs from the shelter that need more medical care than they can give (like around the clock care) and are basically unadoptable because of their conditions. I found a new love. I was doing great. Taking my meds as prescribed, never failed a drug test, had a great relationship with my PM doc, I had nothing to hide and he trusted me 100%. Sadly he moved away recently so another doctor did my procedure that left me with a spinal cord injury.

This has completely turned my world upside down. I can’t drive, I can’t walk without a cane or walker more than 20 feet, my husband bought me a mobility scooter and I have to use that for grocery shopping and Costco and stuff like that. People stare. I want to flip them off. But I just ignore them. Up until last week I feel like I did pretty good at staying positive about the whole thing. But last week I learned that I’ll probably never be able to pee normally again (I have serious retention problems from the SCI, and I can’t feel when my bladder is full, which causes me to leak at times, and I can’t feel that I’m wet). It’s a fucking nightmare. Last week the urologist said I’m going to have to cath myself several times a day for the rest of my life. I lost it. I have been an emotional wreck since the appointment. This has taken everything from me. I’m trapped in my house when my husband is at work because I can’t drive. I can’t have sex. I can’t even pee normally and I piss myself pretty regularly. It’s humiliating. I can’t walk my dogs. I have to use that scooter and I hate people staring at me. Friends have abandoned me. Thank god for my husband and my kids and my dogs. They are the only things getting me thru right now.

I crashed and burned emotionally. I’m self medicating my depression with my pain meds. It’s getting out of control but I don’t even really care. I started banging my dilaudid and today I moved up from 8mg to 12mg. I’m in a downward spiral and I see it coming but I don’t even care to stop it. I hate myself. I hate this mess. I hate my body because it’s failing me and it’s not even my fault. I’m pretty young and so I have many many years ahead of this. I’ve plateaued in my recovery, so anything else I gain will be slow and minimal. So this is it. It took an hour for my life as I knew it to be totally destroyed. It has effected all of us in my family. It’s a complete lifestyle change from my family. I don’t know what to do from here.

I popped 30mg together with my Methadone and a lil Lyrica. I was floating so damn nicely. I felt like I wore a bathrobe made of cotton candy. I took a walk and every color was radiating pure pastel joy; music was gently humming and every note like a butterfly alighting in your ear canal.


So there's your cheesy and turgid description (inspired by reading too  much Joyce) of what makes Valium so damn nice, especially with Lyrica together. I took a total of 40 mg today.

Other benzos though are completely boring to me. K-pins especially, I can eat 10mg and feel nothing. Xanax makes me feel nice for like 15 minutes before I hit the floor sleeping. In combination with dope or Lyrica, benzos are super nice though. Just an absolutely beautiful mellow feeling, like you're watching a perpetual rose-colored dusk while bedded in silk or some shit that is super comfy fuck if I know.


So let's hear it! Do you use benzos? If so which ones? For come-downs, combos of just by themselves?",1532377074.0

How risky would it be to try some Kratom to get a mild high or buzz. I'm past the point of craving opiates or anything so I don't want to risk dragging myself back down. Is kratom basically just going to be like taking some codeine or is it way weaker or what? Do you think I can safely use it without risking dragging myself back into addiction?

91abc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/91abc3/opioids_and_lifting/,59,https://redd.it/91abc3,VirtualAttention,Opioids and lifting,"Of course people who use opioids regularly will experience side effects like vomiting, lack of appetite, lack of drive, unhealthy lifestyle etc. Of course these factors will make it difficult to f.e. hit caloric goals or workout regularly. Moreover if you exercise high then bradycardia and shallow breathing will make you fatigued faster. If you have a withdrawal then you won't even think about going to the gym and will puke your ass out. And so on and so forth.

But are these only reasons for why hitting the gym doesn't go in pair with using opioids? Like for example opioids innately inhibit muscle growth. Or they fuck up your hormones. Or they're catabolic. Or something like that. If you f.e. had other factors in check - you use opioids moderately but still eat enough, exercise regularly and sober, have a good sleep etc. - would it inhibit your gains substantially? And how much?

I use heroin occasionally / moderately - no withdrawals, little to no tolerance. Sometimes I'd binge for three days in a row, sometimes I'd do one moderate shot for a few days straight, sometimes I would not touch dope for two months at all. Realistically I won't be able to stop completely but would like to hit the gym to change something in my life. But I don't know whether there's any merit in hitting the gym while using H in a way I just described.",1532375364.0

She told us she only does meth but will never turn away an opportunity to make some money. Understandable. So my boyfriend lets her know we just want to try a bit and see how the stuff is first so we only want a half. Well....

This chick obviously had no clue what she was getting into and after two days of texting and trying to figure out where to meet her (and avoiding her random streams of calls EVERYTIME she took a hit of meth and became paranoid as fuck) we finally agree to meet at a gas station and grab it from her. Mind you, when we met her we couldn't believe the cops hadn't called on her.....

To understand why I say this, let me explain what my boyfriend and I saw as we pulled into the gas station (which is a Safe Place!). We see her, a 300 pound white chick with half her head shaved, the other half in two foot long rainbow dreads, in an old car lifted with huge rims, no windows at all, and every door of the car is swung wide open as she blasts rap music. She is smoking a swisher and is literally just dancing by herself in the parking lot.  As she see's us pulling in she jumps in her car, takes a hit off her meth pipe (and yes! all the cars door were still open). My boyfriend gets out of the car and starts talking about her stereo, so at least if anyone pulled up he could say he was thinking of buying her stereo, and while they are talking she slips the stuff to me through the car window, I hand her the cash, and we got the fuck out of there. We even told her before all of this that since we've lived in that town we had never seen that gas station not have a cop in it, and she still decide's to pull this crazy shit. Oh well. All's well that ends well.

So any who.

We get home, throw the bag in the freezer for a few minutes and then we weigh it out. We paid $40 expecting a half gram and ended up with .7!! Not only that, but it was pure fire y'all. So we're sitting here thinking ""Fuck yeah! Maybe this crazy chick is worth it."" Well nope! She hit's us up the next day asking what we thought of the product, we told her it was okay and how much an eighth would be. She obviously took a hit off her meth pipe because she immediately starting freaking out saying she would just come by my boyfriend's work and talk because we were being way too specific on messenger...... She was fine with that sentence yesterday.

Well, she went and talked to my boyfriend that night saying that her guy got pissed at her for selling it so cheap to us. She claimed that her dealer sells it to everyone else for $15 a point and that he wants her to sell it like that from now on with no price breaks. My boyfriend's response? ""Well fuck that. I wouldn't have even bought the half if it was more than the $40. I told you I'm not an addict. I don't want it that bad."" And as expected the chick back peddled like crazy saying she would talk to her guy and see if he can make an 'exception' for us.

So obviously this chick told her dealer that she sold the half for $40 and the guy called her a fucking moron and told her how much she could sell it for to an addict. She didn't believe my boyfriend one bit when we told her that we buy in bulk and only do a g or 2 once a month for fun. 

My boyfriend has already received 4 calls from her today with voicemails that range from her crying incoherently to her cussing him out but is yelling a different guy's name. I expect around 2am we will get a coherent answer and the eighth for $120 is still going to be a good deal.",1532373531.0

Passed drug test w Apple juice & banged dope in parkin lot.,"Yea my life's been spiraling out of control really bad since I got out of jail a little over 2 weeks ago. I've been shooting boy & girl and taking xans and smoking meth. I usually don't take bars unless I was in wds bc I've lost so many ppl to it and I get plenty fd up speedballing. I love the combo but I try my best to avoid it and used to do well but this girl I was with was constantly taking them and so I started to as well. I've been smoking meth as well which is not something I was ever been into. I don't like the geeky twacked feeling. Several of the people I run with do it all the time and always offer it to me for free. They will even often give me 2 or 3 pts just trying to look out for me bc I'm blessed to have a couple groups of friends that love me a lot. I've never been one to do people dirty and ive helped them all out when i could and that shit has made me a saint to them. I don't keep friends that try to finesse me or always need my help but show no love so the friends I have help me a ton so yea free meth and shit. Normally I don't do it but lately a lot of times if they offer, I do it. Also once they left me a bag and I did it over the course of some days and didn't sleep and eventually I started hallucinating and it hasn't stopped. I'll see colors slowly change, patterns move little by little and worst of all I'll see a bug or mouse or something run past out of the corner of my eye that doesn't exist. The shooting boy and girl thing I've been doing for a while tho. So yea my life's fucked.

I'm also on probation and haven't been able to give them a legit address since I got out. I can't give them my real address bc everyone here is a felon that does drugs and the owner of the house sells drugs. Out of the house. Lol. I can't even lie anymore bc my aunt was the only person who'd let me lie and use her address but the police have came there and searched for me like 5 times in the last 2 years. I've been fugitive status for like 15 of the last 24 months. 2 separate runs ending with jail. The judge told me if I violate in any way possible he's sending me to prison for the most time he can and he's known for keeping his word. I've been having to say I'm couch surfing and don't have anywhere so she is giving me a couple weeks to sort it out or ""we'll have to discuss other options"". Idk wtf that means but I don't want to find out. And I'm on home visits now instead of reporting.

The good news is I got a job today! I had to use apple juice to pass the drug test. The pay is ok and it'll let me rent somewhere else very soon so I'll get out of the rat infested hell hole I'm in and give my PO my real address. It's dangerous and they don't play on that rent. They bitch about it constantly and I'm 1 week behind and I don't bitch about the rats or mould and shit. And it's not just a couple rats. It's a full on see them in the middle of the day running across the floor in front of ppl infestation now. Anyway, I also got the Xanax chick out of my life and stopped doing any meth. They still offer. I've just got back in my groove of saying no. I still hallucinate some though, especially when sleepy and that's concerning but whatever. Oh I've also tried to cut way back on the speedballs. I've been super reckless since getting out but this is a great step in the right direction. When I move I will probably go to a mdone clinic again bc I can't stay sober permanently at this point and my home boy got a job at the same places as me today and we are renting a place soon and he's not going to stop doin boy and Tina. I can resist the ice but not boy unless I'm on mdone.

He gave a lot of officials shit for being communist or tied to communist. Sometimes he bothered people who had very loose connections to ""communism"" in various forms. His alleged goal was to expose and put a stop to subversive acts.

&nbsp;

In reality, he probably was using the dirt he dug up on people to blackmail them though I have no immediate proof of that, it just sounds about right.

You might even remember a term, ""McCarthyism"" but if not, do not despair. 

&nbsp;

As it would turn out it was determined that the man was addicted to heroin. Well, that explains his energetic fervor in prosecuting his countrymen.

From the Wikipedia article:

> ""McCarthy had also become addicted to heroin. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy's addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused.[143] In Anslinger's memoir, The Murderers, McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:

'I wouldn't try to do anything about it, Commissioner [. . .] It will be the worse for you [. . .] and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn't care [. . .] The choice is yours.'[143]


**Anslinger decided to give McCarthy access to heroin in secret** from a pharmacy in Washington, DC. **The heroin was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics**, right up to McCarthy's death. 


&nbsp;

McCarthy's death had something to do with Hepatitis, some say it was related to alcoholism but if he was an IV heroin user..  I wonder if it was that.


> 'McCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as ""**Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown**""; doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism, an estimation that is now accepted by contemporary biographers.'

&nbsp;

Sorry if you read this whole thing and though it sucked but you're welcome for your history lesson of the day. I also heard Churchill liked amphetamines but I didn't investigate it too deeply.


OHHH and one more history fun fact! 

Nazi soldiers including members of the Waffen S.S. were issued a pill which combined amphetamines with oxycodone. It should be noted that Hitler did fux with an early form of oxycontin. I'm reluctant to say that the soldiers were issued something containing oxycontin as opposed to oxycodone because I just don't know if they had been given an immediate release formulation. Everything about the drugs given to Nazi soldiers mention oxycodone in the text as opposed to the 'contin.

Although, many months ago when we tried to UP my dose, the doctor was all about it, but the insurance wouldn’t do it unless I jumped thru hoops, which I had completed 95% of them, but the only one I didn’t complete was trying to taper down first to see if it was possible to be on less. So, now that I tried to taper (and have went from 180 mg a day of ER morphine down to 100 mg morphine now) they SHOULD be ok with it, right? I’m not asking for a huge increase, just 20 mg.

I met a girl several months ago via Reddit after she responded to a post about an activity I was going to attend in her city \[she lives five hundred miles from me\]. She agreed to go with me after my previous companion bailed on me.

If ""love at first sight"" is a trite way to describe it, I can think of no better way to articulate it. This person is incredibly magnetic, and complimentary to my own personality in ways I've never discovered in another human being. Except, of course, for the fact that she is a long-term intravenous heroin user. She first revealed this side to me when she asked to use my hotel bathroom to shoot up, and was as open and honest about her history of use as I might be describing a traffic violation, including her history of prostitution to procure the drug. I was floored by this transparency, having been taught all my life that heroin users are the most duplicitous addicts in existence.

We kept in touch afterwards, and seemed to me like a relationship was fast forming. We talked at length every single day, and about things I would be hard pressed to address  a long-term girlfriend. I made an arrangement to see her in mid-spring, for no particular reason than to visit, and I found her in better spirits than before: she'd been kicked out of her parent's home after they found her rig, but she managed to find a place to stay and, just as importantly, begin dialing down her drug use to a point I was comfortable with it, though I found the use of methadone replacement questionable at best. She was even functional enough to maintain a high-stress job, which I still find incredibly admirable.

It was on this trip that I told her my feelings for her, and she acknowledged she felt the same, though warned me that she was in no place emotionally to pursue any kind of relationship. I understood this; I have long known that heroin users are primarily in a relationship with the needle, and in fact I appreciated her shielding me from her own habits. I have done a little light enabling monetarily, though not nearly to the extent to which I could or would be willing.

We made plans to meet once again just last week. And as before, everything was initially fine - until her roomate kicked her out of her apartment for using. In a hurry, we packed up her things and moved her into the apartment of a \[currently actively using\] couple she'd met at the clinic. Almost immediately something seemed off - they are a deeply toxic couple anyway, and she seemed less than pleased with the arrangement. And I was horrified to discover that they have a dealer who a makes deliveries - part of the reason it was so easy for her to get it under control initially, I think, is because of the distance she had to travel to get her shit.

I've been back home for five days now, and our conversation has ground to a halt. While I am completely understanding of her predicament - her commute to work is quite longer, and she says she is in the process of looking for someplace else to live - I'm not an idiot. I'm metaphysically certain she's using more than she was before, and I'm not sure heroin is all she's using: the head of the household has a taste for meth, which she is inexperienced with despite being a herojin user for a decade

My problem here, essentially, is threefold:

1. Can I trust my instinct that this girl is not manipulating me? I feel that an open and conscious deliberate manipulator would use sex and love - in other words, she'd fuck me and tell me she loved me doing it just to get money if that's all she wanted. But she didn't. We have not had sex, nor are we officially dating, because, she says, she doesn't feel she can do either at the moment. I feel touched by this, as if she is protecting me from herself. It convinces me she's being emotionally honest - but I still have to admit some skepticism, however unwarranted. It's also the case that you can ""kill someone with kindness"", though I believe this operates on a baser, less cognizant level.
2. I offered to move her down here with as much heroin as necessary to make the withdrawal process as painless \[if prolonged\] as possible. She said it was a possibility at the time, but hasn't brought it up since. Have I, in my admittedly juvenile zeal to ""save her from herself"", alienated her by trying to put her in a position where she would feel emotionally obligated to me? I do not want to be an imposition on her. In this I don't care if she'd be using me or not.
3. If I approach this situation with a light touch, as every instinct I have suggests I do, how can I be sure she won't forget about me or blame me somehow when she comes out of this current funk and finds something more stable? Conversely, how can I keep up communications with her without seeming pushy or overbearing? I would give up everything here immediately to be with her if she wanted that. But she has to actually, y'know, want that. ",1532355905.0

I'm so fed up with this shit and I really am starting to consider that death is really the only way out.

I really, really hate AA and it has never worked for me over the many years that I've been trying it.  it has never given me relief, ever, and I really want to get high right now.  despite having ""done the steps"".

I think the first problem is that I don't believe in god.  any god, gods, etc.  I can't, don't, and won't.  ever.  no matter how hard I try to make believe and pretend and do what is suggested.  praying makes me feel like an asshole and accomplishes nothing for me.  in addition to that, I have hep c and it makes me fucking itchy as fuck all the time.  I'm currently on the wait list for treatment, which is great, but I was recently told to pray about it --  to pray to god to make my medical condition go away.  that's like saying prayer will cure cancer.  like are you fucking serious right now?  I'm totally cool with the idea that ""the universe began in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere,"" which the book warns against as being unacceptable.

\[then she tried to backpedal and say that she recognized my medical condition and it was a real problem I was going through and I'd have to hang in there until I got the treatment.  like okay, so now god can't cure my very real medical problem?  I thought he could two days ago?  and while we're at it and using god to justify everything, if this is god's plan who's to say that it's not god's plan for me to just be a fucking junkie forever?  oh wait, right, we only use god selectively to justify things we like.\]

that kind of sounds like how the program likes to justify failure.  they say those who fail are those who have not ""thoroughly followed"" their path.  like if the program doesn't work for you it's your fault for not trying hard enough?  but guess what, I've tried, repeatedly, like my fucking life depended on it \[and it does\] and guess what -- I still want to get high.  I do not feel any less compulsion.  the desire to use has not been fucking magically removed.  duh, of course it hasn't, probably because making a laundry list of my sexual conduct and praying to an imaginary higher power literally has no effect on the medical condition of having a disease \[addiction\].

I honestly believe that the people who have remained sober and claim that the program saved them are literally just the people who have gone into spontaneous remission.  \[because yes that's a real thing.\]   I've had equal success staying sober on will-power alone and I think I'm actually less miserable that way, because at least I'm not being blamed and told to take responsibility for everything horrible that's happened in my life. \[and yes, while most of it really was my fault some things weren't and I fucking refuse to be victim blamed for shit other people did to me! fuck that!\]

I don't know.  I guess I'm just venting, but let's discuss?

I'd like to hear from people who AA has worked for, as well as people who found other ways.

\[and yes, I've read the Orange Papers and no I don't actually agree with very much in them.  except for Bill W being a pervy misogynistic scumbag.  because he was.\]

EDIT:  when I'm talking about god here on in the comments I'm referring to the concept of god as in the AA literature.  I don't mean GOD with a capital G of christian belief. \*\*\*",1532323346.0

My county is known as one of the worst (best?) opiate counties in the country ('Murica), and I am a casual participant.

Lately we've been getting blue fentanyl pressed pills that were very good, almost like they were produced professionally. They always had consistent dosages and potentacies, never had one with a hot spot or one that was weak, just very consistent which is good for safety if you fuck with this shit.

Anyways, I'm still feeling awesome so sorry for rambling. I'll try to get to the point. 
There was a major bust and two dozen people were indicted, so the pills got hard to find.

So I found what I thought were some of these well missed pills. However when I grabbed them they looked different (slightly different color but I think the same press pattern).

The ones I was used to would lay you out if you did a half with no tolerance. So I drank a glass of grapefruit juice and railed half of one. It was very apparent that it wasn't fentanyl, because those kick in in five minutes flat like a truck and only last an hour (unless you smoke weed with them, which seems to dramatically increase the duration for some reason).

This half didn't do anything after insufflating for about 20 or 30 minutes. I was kinda disappointed but I know actual percs and shit take time to work. So I waited an hour and insufflated the other half with 20mg of adderall. After a half hour I didn't feel much so I continued drinking grapefruit juice and railed a whole pill.

This had me feeling alright but I was kind of underwhelmed. I thought maybe the Addy canceled it out some. That was all I had so after an hour and a half I was bored and kind of sober. So I said fuck it, I'll do 20mg of adderall again. The Addy took about a half hour to kick in. When it did kick in the opiates finally kicked in hard, a full two hours after my last opiate line.

I couldn't keep my eyes open. I write raps and between nods bars were coming out of me effortlessly (well, summoning the motor functions to type them was difficult, but the creativity was flowing). I wrote 5 decent 16 measure verses basically effortlessly over the course of an hour while I was nodding hard. I nodded like that for 2-3 hours, spending more time out than in.

I'm just curious what substance(s) you guys think those pills contained. They took so long to kick in after snorting compared to other opiates I've done, and didn't seem to really kick in until that nice Addy euphoria kicked in, and then it hit like a truck.


Tl;DR- what takes 2 hours to kick in intranasally and is potentiated by ground up 20mg Adderall XRs, with a total duration of over 4 or five hours?

Ps-was an awesome surprise when they kicked in hours later after I had wrote them off as weak

Further notes--made it basically impossible to pee (still can't 5 hours in), also  drank two natty daddies (25oz of 8% malt liquor x2) over the course of the night.

Sorry for the long read, I'm feeling too good to be concise. ",1532321866.0

He smiled when I opened the door, and I smiled back.

“Good to see you, Clyde!”

“Good to see you too, Vic.”

“Mind if I come in for a minute?” I stepped to the side and held my open hand out to invite him in. He confessed, “You know, Clyde, I thought about it all night, and I just can’t give you 200 bucks for those drills.” He looked up and smiled. “I decided that it’s only fair for me to give you 250. How’s that sound?” He laughed and handed me five folded bills.

“Sounds great! I got ‘em in this bag.” I reached behind the couch and pulled it over to hand to the pot-bellied man rubbing his hands. “Here they are. Let me go give some of this to Gabriella. I’ll put some shoes on, and then we’ll go.”

“I’ll be out in the truck.”

I walked to the bedroom. The bag taped over the broken window blew up and in when I opened the door. She was snoring and whimpering under the covers. Her black hair stuck to her forehead where she was sweating on the pillow and the strand of drool from the corner of her mouth had dried leaving flakes of white. I put my hand on her shoulder. She moaned in protest.

“Babes, I’m going to work with Vic. There’s 50 bucks for you here on the nightstand. I’ll be back this evening, like six.”

She didn’t open her eyes. She just pretended to sleep.

“I love you baby. I’ll see you tonight.” I kissed her head and walked out.

Vic introduced me to his son, Vic Junior, sitting in the back seat holding his lunch in a brown paper bag. He didn’t seem to have a neck, just shoulders and tree trunk arms. He stared at the car radio with his mouth open. I said hello. He didn’t say a word. We stopped for coffee and cigarettes at a gas station and rented a trailer around the corner from there. When we got to the job site, Vic put a sledge hammer in Vic Junior’s hands who went to work destroying the walls and sinks and cabinets and doors like they were made of match sticks. Vic Senior limped around with a pair of pliers and cut wires or weakened walls with a reciprocating saw. I carried the debris down the stairs and out to the driveway and threw it into the trailer.

By the time we broke for lunch it was almost halfway full. Vic Junior and Senior sat on a couple of cinder blocks and unrolled their bag lunches. The father pulled another brick up for me to sit on and offered me half of his sandwich. He caught me gawking at his son.

“Had some serious behavioral issues as a kid.” He volunteered.

“Oh?”

“Yeah. He spent most of his childhood in juvenile hall and finally he got in real trouble when he was thirteen. They said he hurt some little kid at a McDonalds. Broke his arm and crushed his orbital socket.”

“What’s that?”

“The bone here,” he pointed to the side of his head level with his eye, “around your eye.”

“Whoah.”

“Yeah. He had some troubles, Junior did. State took him, of course, and when he come back out at 21, this is how they gave him to us. They said they did some procedure and gave him some revolutionary treatment. I’m not sure what all, but he don’t talk no more. He knows what I say and listens to what I tell him, but his personality’s gone, reminds me of Frankenstein.”

“I can see that.”

“You’d be blind if you didn’t.”

“How’d you get this job, Vic?”

“Few years back, one of my neighbors, a middle-aged lady, who knew I did some construction asked me if I’d help her father change his toilet. So I say, sure. You know? Come over here and there’s this old guy named George, her father, and he wants me to change his toilet. And I ask him what’s wrong with the one he’s got. You know? *Is it leaking George or what’s wrong with it?* He tells me he wants a deeper bowl to sit on because every time he sits on the one he’s got, his balls touch the water. Haha! Said he was tired of his balls sitting in cold water every time he sat on the pot.  Haha!”

“No way! Really? That’s hilarious.”

“Yeah. So, we did, you know? And I guess he died a few months ago. Now his daughter asked me to come knock the interior out completely. Guess they’re gonna do some kind of remodel and live here or sell it once it’s all fixed up. I don’t know. They never told me all that, but I was happy to do it.”

Vic and I finished eating and pulled out our packs of cigarettes. He had Pall Mall Red 100s. I smoked Camel Filters as a matter of choice, but when my addiction got heavier and money got tighter I smoked anything. While we smoked, he pulled a baggie from his pocket and a pack of papers out of it to roll up some weed. I did a double take.

“Hey, Vic, I thought you were in the program. You know working the steps and all that. I always assumed you were an old timer in the meetings.”

“I am.”

“But you smoke weed?”

“You know, I had a really bad IV coke habit when I was younger, but I got sober to get into the military after I met Junior’s mother. I was 31 when I came home from Desert Storms. I was on the pain pills real bad back then.”

“You get hurt?”

“Friendly fire. One of our own planes flew down on our little convoy and ripped us up. Killed a bunch of us. I just took one in the foot. Well, I shouldn’t say *just took one in the foot.* It shattered all of the bones in there. Now I walk like it’s made of a 4x4 or something, huh? But, I had my struggles with addiction, real struggles. It was crazy. Junior’s mom died when he was six, and I got worse than ever before. The rooms helped me for a while. I worked some of the steps. They’ll tell you it’s the only way, you know, to work all 12 steps and keep your sponsor and sponsee, all that, but I was done about halfway through step three. Flushed all my pills one afternoon and never went back to them. Course, Junior’s mother is dead and an old man like me, well, he gets lonely if you know what I’m saying. There’s a lot of women at those meetings. So, I still go. Smoking pot is my business.  They don’t need to know all that.”

I nodded. We got back to work. Towards the end of the day, I ended up in an old bedroom that was part of the attic. No one had been up there in years. It had a window and, in the sill, sat an old composition notebook covered in dust and dead insects and wisps of white cob web. I grabbed it and waved it through the air trying to shake off the dead bugs and dust. When I was a kid, I used to build castles and forts out of all the different shaped building blocks and created what I know now are called avatars out of figurines, like they were little versions of myself or characters who I controlled in the castle. Even though I could see myself moving them and talking for them as a kid, they couldn’t see me. I was this invisible giant controller. I would put random articles in their vicinity for them to interact with. They wouldn’t have known where they came from. They wouldn’t know they were intentionally left there by me. They didn’t know a crazy 4-year-old kid named Clyde held their lives and fate in his hands. I wondered if I was just some invisible and giant child’s avatar myself, walking around in a house he’d made of building blocks. Was this book something he'd intentionally placed before me? I wouldn’t have known the difference.

I opened it and read from the hand-written ink parts of a story about a cabinet maker with a big nose who ended up living at one of his clients’ houses. In the morning the family would be cooking breakfast, but when they looked out the window, there was the big nosed, long haired cabinet maker smoking a joint or brushing his teeth in the bushes with the garden hose. He smoked really terrible weed and was a terrible nuisance in general. The story made me laugh, so I tucked the notebook into my waistband and walked back downstairs. We worked another half hour before Vic told me to wrap it up. We got into the truck. We rode listening to oldies on the radio. The old man sang along when he knew the words.

I got out the truck at Gabriella’s house and told Vic that I was thankful for the work again. He showed me his palm and put his head down in humility. He told me it was nothing, that he was thankful to me. Back in the house, all the lights were on, and it looked like Gabriella had gone through a short-lived phase of wanting to remodel one of the living room walls. Instead of a sledge hammer though, she’d used two chairs from the kitchen, which both sat on the ground by the wall, each with its legs broken off. There were flecks of white paint and and even small biscuits of plaster and pieces of popcorn from the ceiling scattered in the green carpet. The blackened bottom half of a sprite can and two dismantled syringes sat next to a lighter and an empty bag on the soot streaked lamp stand next to the couch.

In the kitchen, the AM radio blared the blabbering of two talk show hosts on two different stations bleeding in over each other. Gabriella folded at the waist like a taco like she was trying to touch her nose to her big toe. Her black hair and the backs of her hands lay draped on the linoleum floor. Her feet pointed away towards the stove, so I could see her face. She looked like she’d scratched her cheeks with her finger nails, like she was trying to claw her face off. It seemed like the kind of thing she might do. There was a large pot of meatballs and red sauce on the stove top. It had already boiled over and splattered the floor and walls and cabinets with the sauce now black and set like glue. *Is this the fourth or fifth batch of meatballs she’s made since I’ve known her?* I asked myself. She must have cooked 20 meatballs in every pot. Times four, that’s 80 meatballs, but I never saw her eat one. I know I never ate any. Where did they go? How come she just kept making meatballs?

I turned the stove top off and grabbed her iphone on the counter and walked to the living room. She was nodded out harder than I had seen her yet. That notebook was still in my waistband. I wanted to read more of it, so I went to sit on the couch. Victor had given me a joint before he dropped me off. It was the chronic.",1532310895.0

I didn't care, I saw his heart and soul. Long story short  - he fucks  up and OD's a few times.  I always collect him because - love. He went to rehab, did wonderfully, came back  home to us. He was getting vivitrol, yet the  clinic allowed him to self administer. (On probation, had passes to come to me, neighboring state so pharmacy would fill, ship,  and shit). Long story short, he skipped his last vivitrol injection. Due 8 June. Lied.  He was found  dead in his car on 3 July. Probably died 2 July/1 July from the decomp smell of his belongings. 
Do what you will with this  story, I loved him. So many lies, and secrets, but under that... He DID love me too. He was a slave to this shit. Guess my point is - everyone has SOMEONE who loves them, pls talk to US!  We Will never judge and always help!  Please be safe, everyone.

Walking, and talking to myself;


It helps to keep the fear in caskets 


So that the dead will stay dead 




Catatonic direction in low light 


The sun doesn't reach these places 


Claustrophobic attraction to the night 


I fall to my knees and beg to stasis 




""I can't find my way out of this place now""


I jump at how desperation sounds in the underneath 


I realise I'm just talking to myself again 


And I walk on, finding no map nor relief 




Dusty life once walked these low halls 


I try to find solace in that thought


I am not alone, and I hear a calling 


From the coffin I pass; as an afterthought 




""You are not alone"" the dead voice crooned


""Who are you?"" I panick, I already knew


That voices reflective rotting- leather tone


It chuckled, opening the coffin ""I am you""




I saw the empty socket of a dead eye 
emerging, and ran


""Don't go down that way"" I heard 


From a distance I swear it mournful 


Continuing I walk and talk, undeterred.

Except this shit is different. Now for a quick backtrack, I’ve been buying “dope” from this guy for a while which unfortunately in my neighborhood is almost always fent/cut or fent/dope/cut. Now I know fent can be a cold mistress due to it lacking that warm hug from God euphoria that a good shot of heroin provides but this shit I copped today is something else.

I'm having a hard time getting a rush/high from the bags. His shit is definitely not bunk because it gets me well and my pupils pinned but I can't get a rush and I don't get that care free, feel good feeling that makes dope my favorite drug. The bags also draw up in the rig as clear as water. It's hard to describe. Its like all the physical effects of dope are there but not the mental. All the bad shit like not being able to make my dick work and raspy voice are present but without the euphoria that makes me not care.

Fucking sucks. Now I know fent can lack euphoria but is it possible to have NO euphoria or even general mood lift?

I'm so tired.

Sooo tired.

I am sick and in pain all the time, and I can no longer go through life like this. I don't have money for heroin anymore. Pain, horrible physical and mental pain all the time. That's what bi-polar is; that is, at least my bi-polar. The inability to feel pleasure, and the amplification of pain, melancholy, and basically every negative emotion know to man. Over 10 years of doctors, and not an iota of help. The fact of the matter is that there is no solution. I am nothing but a burden on everyone. I do nothing but hurt those I love. There is no legal cure for me, and I cannot afford to fix myself.

Even though my tolerance is miniscule, maybe 1-1.5 bags a day, I have been an IV addict for so long that the withdrawals are excruciating. As I mentioned, I am bi-polar, and I finally get just the right insane episode I had been waiting for. Finally, it is time. I pop bunch a of benzos, to take my fear away. Benzos have always made me feel suicidal, reckless, and fearless, so this will help take the final step for certain.

I steal a ...lethal object. Insurance policy.

A number of public transportation switches later, I finally make it to the hood, and call my guy. I am very sick at this point, and so eager for the relief of death. My dealer has been 100% reliable and sold me excellent quality dope for over 6 months now. I buy 12 bags. I notice he is gray and strange looking, but I dismiss that. 

I walk a couple blocks to my ""nest"" - the bushes alongside the I-90 highway where I can hide and do my dope. It is littered with scores of needles, and I survey the scene and smile, thinking of each moment of pleasure, or rather, each moment free of pain, that each of those needles represent. It is a peaceful area. It seems like a nice place to die, and with little chance of anyone finding me and resuscitating me.

I already took a large number of benzos, and I take some more. I make two shots, out of the 12 bags, one 8 bag shot, and one 4 bag shot. I assume the benzos, combined with my ~1 bag a day tolerance means that death and final peace will be certain.

I always thought, those people who write suicideletters don't really want to die. Or who make a big fuss and long standing threats about it. They do those things because they want something, perhaps something they can't have, or perhaps something they can, such as revenge. But a tired soul wants nothing but peace. When animals sense their mortality, they go under the porch, or find some other comfortable spot, and stay there until it is over. Same with humans who really want to die. 

No note, no phone calls, no threats, and no warnings - just a lone young man sitting on the ground, ecstatic for the final release of pain.

First the 8 bag shot into the arm, followed quickly by the 4 bag shot IMed into the thigh. 

I am so happy. Happier than I've ever been in my life (without heroin that is). I'm so eager, I'm so excited. This is a dream come true. 

I sit there.

I wait.

I wait.

I wait.

Nothing. 

Try to imagine that. To be certain of death. To anticipate a sensation that will take the pain away and end the nightmare of life. To wait. To wait. Where is it? WHERE IS IT?

As it turns out, my gray, 6 month-reliable dealer turned into a junkie himself, and ripped me off. 

I go insane. More insane than I've been in my entire life. I am going to kill a man",1532295465.0

I took 75mg of methadone 3 hours ago, I was IVing more than 400mg of morphine/day, in between doses, obviously, 180mg-150mg-120mg going like that. Besides my precribed benzo/escitalopram. Took 1mg of klona and 0.5mg of flunitrazepam.

When my morphine ended, I found some dones 5mg tabs and took 75mg without thinking right after I woke up sick, really sick. I could cope a box of morphine now, 60x30mg ER morph, the methadone took away any physical discomfort, but I am still craving a morphine shot. It will be total waste? I dont take methadone like a week ago, I only take when I dont have morphine, or when I dont have money, or when I have some very important thing to do that need me function normally.

Anyway, question is, the shot will be a waste even if Im not taking methadone everyday, or I would feel it? I am craving hard, and I know very little bout the blocking way of methadone, I always did methadone when I got out morphine, never various days in a row, and I didnt feel any blocking effects, but i've waited almost 24h after I took it to dose everytime.

I thought that adding low dose of speed into the mix could mitigate some of these side effects. For example make you less sleepy and dilate your pupils a little. The only thing I fear that it might not have any effects as it will be overriden by heroin. I try to refrain from large doses in such settings by the way - would take around the ""moderate"" amount.

This literally just popped into my mind and thought it was interesting. 

So if you don't know, A Clockwork Orange is about a kid named Alex who gets arrested for murder and chooses to undergo an experimental process in hopes of a commuted sentence.

Only the process leaves him completely incapable of doing any wrong; as in it makes him physically ill and incapacitated. If someone starts shit with him and he thinks about retaliating, he buckles and vomits.

The process also has an unintended effect on his love for classical music, specifically Mozart.

I had a thought that vivitrol and to an extent buprenorpheine are akin to the Ludovico process Alex undergoes.

The main theme of the book shows when the prison priest talks to Alex after he undergoes the process telling him, ""If a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""

Saying, at least as far as the book is concerned, that if we could, it would be wrong to force someone to be ""good"" by taking away their choice to be bad. Which is kinda where my mind goes when I think about vivtrol.

The idea sounds good, but I've heard others talk about being a prisoner in your own mind, and I feel like if I've been subconsciously using dope to dull the depression I feel and suddenly I'm incapable of achieving that past feeling, id probably jump from out of a window.

I feel it takes on a greater parallel if you think about drug court and how we're forcing those who get caught holding or using to get on vivtrol themselves.

- Leave Tuesday evening expecting my emergency contact to come get me. (They dont give you your phone or let you make a phone call if you AMA)

- Emergency contact or brother cant come get me. I spend the entire night outside the facility.

- Wednesday AM they let me back in.

- About to fall asleep around 1pm but new roommate comes in and says he needs me to leave room so he can bring girl in to fuck. 

- Pissed off, still havent slept. My boy and I decide to leave around 6pm or so. Going on 36 hours no sleep on top of withdrawal.

- 20 minutes into walk dehydration and no sleep sets in I flag down car to call ambulance since im feeling like im going to pass out even though my heart rate felt insanely high.

- My boy comes with me on ambulance. I basically had a panic attack most likely due to dehydration, no sleep, and anxiety from withdrawal.

- Hospital is farther away from Philly. We are now an hour and 20 mins or so away.

- Using phone at hospital he cant get ride and my ride cant get me.

- I have 40 bucks on me but no where to go. We find out our path home is a bus that comes to hospital at 6am. Goes to West Chester Station. From there Septa takes us to 69th street station or whatever. Then the L all the way to allegheny.

- There is no place to lay down at hospital. Luckily they let us stay there overnight though.

- I still had not slept, by 6am that morning when the bus came I was on 48 hours no sleep. We finally got to Philly. Copped dope (fentanyl of course since that is all that seemingly exists in kenzo these days). We both were finally able to get separate rides home around noon that day. 

- 54 hours of no sleep while in withdrawal + an ambulance ride and hospital visit that will probably cost me 10k in bills, but I made it home  and then regretted it once I got there.

- Currently planning on getting back on methadone maintenance.

- Anyone else have any crazy experiences leaving a rehab?",1532278646.0

Read below. Wanna just leave what helped you through the withdrawal? ESPECIALLY RLS AND BACK PAIN. Go for it you beautiful fuck.**

Wanting to die is fucking **hilarious.**

My last line was Friday. 

Codeine crushed, watered and up the bung was keeping me ready to human on Saturday. Long legs, worth the discomfort — wasn’t working orally anymore. 

Sunday I had a mental breakdown and realised I had to quit. I’ve done it all and been to the brink of every substance — nothing grabs you like opiates right? 

I went home to kill myself. Almost died driving home. 

Arrive home and I instead have a terrifying DMT trip where I didn’t breakthrough like last time and instead felt like I was suffocating for ten minutes. 

Best thing ever. My mortality is back. Nothing like the strongest psychedelic to remind you about the void that is death. No ego death like last time but wow, hi death, nice to meet you; you’re a cyclical force and I respect you. It’s like the DMT kicked me in the balls. Tough love. Thank you spirit molecule. You surround me everywhere I go and are always there to kick my ass. 

I’m 23. Leaving for my mum’s place tomorrow.  She deals with us fuck up’s for a living. Fuck kicking it in a hospital right? I’ll be in a room with Netflix and a doctor prescribed way out. 

I won’t have weed for a few days but wow — only way to get sleep against restless legs right? Don’t even like the high at all but it helps withdrawal AMAZINGLY. Way better than Valium. 

Any other help for that? **The back pain makes me squirm and is by far the worst symptom**

I’ve broken a lot of bones. Almost died as a kid too many times to count by chance of life. 

**NOTHING** has been as painful as this restless legs zero sleep opiate withdrawal bullshit. It brings anyone to their knees, crying. 

I guess Valium helps but eh... I’m probably going to just get a bunch of Xan’s and sleep it out forever. 

I’m doing 0.5g every 4-5 days. It costs about $250 for 0.5g where I live. Yep. And this is THE shit. A 1mg line once had me nodding for hours at the start. No fent. But at that price — I don’t think many people make it years in around here like in the USA. 

Anyway. Once I hit clean... I shall be trying antidepressants until something works for me. 

Talk therapy — not so much. My support system is great. Took my whole life but they exist so don’t give up if you haven’t found yours guys. 

A guy I pay to call the wrong name in the waiting room and is paid to listen to me speak? He should at least gimme some gas money the fuck. 

I did extra H that day just for him. I may call and reconcile — he has called 7 times to his credit. Professional. 

Never IV’d. Didn’t get the rush. Probably for the best. So I’m thinking I can get away. 

Will I relapse? Probably. According to what I’ve read here, it’s part of the process. 

Opiates are heaven. Opiates are hell. 

What be your advice?

I’ve tried using google before y’all jump on me. This is very specific I feel like.

I experienced this intense whole body soreness, lack of balance thing before I got on subs a few days ago and at first it completely took away these symptoms and I felt great, second day still feeling pretty great, the last 2 days the dose just isn’t doing the trick it seems like? All these symptoms are back full force.  I called my doc because I see him in a few days but wanted to know how to proceed and he said your body needs to adjust to the drug and “take another half” if need be. 
Help? 
I don’t want to raise my tolerance id really like to be on only 4mg and why did it work so well at first and then stop?
I should note that I wake up in the morning that is when I feel the worst.

tl;dr
Complete body soreness and fatigue goes away with first 2 days of sub treatment, returns on third day has not gone away since and I’m on day 4. Take another 2mg until I feel ok or let my body adjust to the dose I’m on? ",1532266800.0

Anyway since this is the only place you guys will get this im just type it out for shits n giggles. 

Got kicked out of my clinic at 30mg had about id say 15-20mg from saving some take homes. 
Last dose of that was Friday idk the mg I was taking a oral syringe and I’m not sure if it’s 1mg/1mL. Highly doubt it. Anyway I did about less than 2ml and benzos to potentiate it. So id assume that was probably 10mg or less. 
I have 2 pretty large benzos scripts or there’s no way I’d get through this. Valium is a god send. 
ANYWAY today will be 72 hours no methadone. I could of probably inducted yesterday scored a 20 on cows but I was home alone and really scared of the PWDS so took a few Valium and went to sleep. 
Just woke up and Valium def still in my system. Have all the withdrawals except muscle pain and stomach pain. (I did eat twice through this and it did not end well so I’ve sworn off food) but still get random stomach cramps. 
Anyway once the Valium wears off I’m gonna do about 1mg. See how I feel in an hour. Do 2mg and so on. 

Really siked to get this monkey off my back. Excited to stop paying $600 a month to the clinic and waiting in line like fucking cattle. (No diss it did save my life there for a minute)

But yeah pretty excited! Hope everyone here is doing well. And hopefully I’m not back in a few months asking for someone to mail me rigs 😂. 

TLDR: inducting on subs today after week long methadone taper. Really excited. And I have subutex which I hear is a lot better than suboxone. So yeah everyone wish me luck ! Love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️",1532265165.0

I am a Reddit newbie! And I will let you know now that this post is all over the place! It's my first ever post on Reddit ! Thank you so much for taking the time to read and respond ! Thank you !!!!!!!! 

I have been in a handful of car accident's . Long story short been on pain management since I was 20 years old . Am 25 now . I've been on and off oxycodone for 5 years now. I decided to stop cold turkey 2 years ago when one of my docs out of the BLUE put me on 100 mcg fentanyl patches and still my oxys. I didn't get the rush / euphoria from fentanyl felt zombie like . Came off of it real quick . I have gone through 2 MEMORABLE  OXY withdrawals. You know the kind . trembling, twitching , restlessfuckinglegsyndrome  , sweats , etc btw currently am prescribed 4 15's a day . Green M boxes . And promethazine for nausea due to the oxy. My tolerance is ridiculously high so on average I double up all doses. ANYWAYS I apologize for going off topic. I was sick and tired of being imprisoned by the pills . I am married have a toddler and corporate executive. I told my doc I wanted to get off completely and he said it's not a good idea to stick to the program. I am in the medical field myself and I am furious he says this to me because the physicians get a percentage from big pharma reps from each script that is written monthly. With that said I decided to wean off with the help of my husband . This is where am at now . Today I went 30 hours with ZERO opiate . And I'll be honest with you . The only reason why I took it is because I couldn't stand the fucking depression anymore . I feel like a shitty wife because I told my husband "" you know what baby give me a green am in alot of pain and in withdraw "" him trusting me blindly gave me a 15 immediately. What I am confused about is No it didn't give me that euphoria we know and love . All it did was give me a sense of hey ! Your alive! Get up and play games at Peter piper pizza with your kid ! ( That's where I was ) BTW I've been working on weaning myself for over a month now.  In the beginning of me weaning it was horrendous but I had a shit load of tramadol help me with the aches and pains and mental shit . Tramadol doesn't do A GODDAM THING FOR ME when it comes to euphoria . It might as well be Tylenol . Just FYI . I also have tried kratom in between . A week ago my husband was splitting my greens . So twice a day 7.5 mg of oxy . And I was fine . No euphoria but I was functional. Then just 7.5 once a day and started to feel like I was pushing it the depression hit deep just the craving. Then somehow we decided it was to low and I was to depressed so we went to the full 15 for the day . Which works fine . Keep in mind I want to be off off of these COMPLETELY. here's the main question and the reason for this post . Since I can go 24/30 + hours from last oxy dose and NOT feel the sweats or shivers or twitching or restlessfuckinglegsyndrome or diahreaa etc when before I was weaning off 6 hours would pass and my nerves we're SHOT 12 hours would pass and I would be in FULL BLOWN WITHDRAW. So does this mean due to the almost 2 months that I've been weaning off that I might be able to just stop ? Just to reiterate today I was already at 30 hours of no oxy and I was not in withdraw no symptoms nothing . It was the mental anxiety of me feeling like I just NEEDED something . Am convinced it could've been a fucken placebo and I would've been the same . I wasn't in withdraw but I also wasn't myself .... I was just a walking talking X person . No humor , no fun, no silly , no nothing ... Just present with no presence. I feel like shit for lying to my husband saying I was in pain and in withdraw etc but he's never been on any opiates and am grateful for it but I just wish he understood . I hate being a LEGAL DRUG ADDICT . The fact that I have a prescription and you don't or do doesn't make a fucking difference this shit is liquid heroin.  And in a life of corporate medicine you feel like you need it to get by the sad corruption you see. I am 25 years old and have been a Chief Marketing Officer for an extremely large medical corporation since I was 21. Since I was able to go multiple times 30+ hours with no oxy and no withdraw symptoms my question is am I still dependent or did I succeed in surpassing the withdrawal and this is just opioid depression??  Their is so much more to my story but I really just want this question answered and advise so I know if I just push a little harder and fight the anxiety or if their are more options . Thank you reddit ! I truly appreciate what feels like a lifeline .

90v2xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/90v2xx/sentenced_to_a_life_of_misery/,8,https://redd.it/90v2xx,Quobell,Sentenced to a Life of Misery?,"I'm new here - this is a throwaway account, but I've been lurking for a while. I just need to put this somewhere where people MIGHT understand and have advice. 

I'm 40 days clean from my DOC. Can't really say I'm ""clean"" because I've picked up kratom in the past few days (but will likely drop it again since it's doing jack shit for me). 

I don't WANT to be clean anymore. And this isn't a passing feeling. Everything is shit right now. I'm in constant pain. I don't trust doctors anymore. I've just been through a major loss (death) in my life, and honestly, there's only one really important thing that is keeping me tethered to life right now. 

If I wasn't needed, if I didn't have someone I love more than my own life depending on me, someone who I would do anything for, I'd take all the risks, try to cold cop and probably get robbed or jumped, risk a fent overdose, all on the off chance that I might actually score and finally feel a little relief from this constant misery because I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like shit all the time. 

I'm on antidepressants. They help somewhat, but I'm starting to think there's just nothing in this world that will relieve my pain (both physical and emotional) like opiates, and outside of kratom, which isn't working and I'm already taking stupid amounts in desperation), I have no access. 

I'm too chicken shit to try to cold cop. I'm naive, and I'd get scammed in a millisecond at the least and probably fucked up hurt because I don't know the ""rules"" and I wouldn't even know where to go. Beyond asking a panhandler, I'm fucking clueless. 

Thought about the darknet, and I would try it if I thought the chances of getting caught were low enough. I'd especially try it if I didn't have my one motivation to keep living because I know my chances of getting something pressed and overdosing would be high. 

I don't actually want to die, mainly because I'm needed. I am not at the ""rock bottom"" that I read and hear about so often. I have a lot going for me. But it's just constant, unrelenting misery, day in and day out. 

I have shit to do, and I have people who need me to be okay. And I'm not okay. 

I've never done heroin, but if a kind stranger walked into my house right now with some, knew what they were doing, and said they were going to give me a shot of some, I'd take it in a heartbeat. 

After the recent death of someone close to me, a family member told me about all the pills she has and acted like she was going to help me through this rough time. Then, she kept stringing me along until finally, I gave up and realized I would get nothing from her no matter what I offered. I don't know why the fuck she told me all about them and said she'd help me if she wouldn't. 

Again, I'm fucking naive. I have no idea what I'm doing. And I can't afford to get caught, go to jail, or lose my life all because people I love need me. 

So still, I sit here 40 days into misery, not really withdrawal (though I'm sure there is some PAWS going on), but just the pain I have from my condition, knowing I can't trust any doctors to help me without putting me on some obscenely long waiting list or putting me through urine tests and contracts all while they under-treat me. I'm just fed up. 

I don't even know what heroin is around here (and I know I can't reveal my location - but I've read enough on this sub to know that different areas of the country have different ""types"", so to speak, but again, I know nothing). 

I feel like I've been sentenced to a lifetime of constant misery because I'm too chicken shit to risk doing the things I would need to do to get what I need to feel better, but I'm past the actual acute withdrawals and learned that, yep, this is real fucking pain I have, and it's unbearable. 

I hate the opiate epidemic and the bullshit laws they're passing. I hate that I can no longer trust the medical field (I mean, this family member who died, she died really fucking young, and there were major mistakes made with her care that led to her early demise.)

Is this all there is? Fuck sobriety. Fuck being clean. But not really because unwillingly, I have to stay that way. And I'm so fucking sick of it. 

Where was my honeymoon period? Where is the promise that the pain I felt every day from being dopesick would abate and my ""real"" pain wouldn't be that bad? I'm still waiting, and that promise isn't being kept. Kratom has only been a very recent addition, and only out of sheer desperation. I know it's not bullshit because I felt enough on it to know that something was hitting opiate receptors, but I'm still in unbearable pain, and I can't just keep taking more and more and more. 

I'm so pissed and ragey because I know that if this country looked at the opiate epidemic and pain in a better way, I know that if I could find medical professionals who aren't running scared, who would see me as a patient, a person in actual pain, instead of a chart and a risk to their license because I dare to have a condition that causes pain, if these medical professionals could find the right opiate to prescribe me that would actually treat my pain and help me maintain without my tolerance skyrocketing, I'd be in much better shape. 

Again, this isn't just a passing craving or feeling. This is constantly how I feel as long as I'm awake. 

I hate it and I'm so tired and done. But I have to keep on truckin' because people need me. 

Fuck all of this, though. ",1532230956.0

(Haven’t been sober that long),"Here’s a little background I have done a lot of opiates in big amounts, like the rest of you lol 

Anyway I used to take 200 mg of morphine, 10 mg of Vicodin, and 50 mg of tramadol. But when the tramadol ran out and the morphine was scarce I only had Vicodin and oxy I would cwe a whole 60 5mg vicodin script and drink that over a period of 1 1/2 days or so, along splitting 15 mgs oxy nasally with each dose, as before it stopped working but this time I stopped feeling everything except the itch and pain relief from high doses, I started smoking and boofing h, still no effects, so I went to rehab for a month, I went through hell but was given immodium which sort of helped, anyways I digress, I got out and the first day went back to my old games I didn’t want to cwe so I took 60 mg of Vicodin, nothing 10g of kratom, nothing 120 mg of oxy snorted, nothing, so I had been trying to get a nod once a months ever since I got back

Last night went like this
T00:00 180 mg robocough 
As a potentiator heard it would lower tolerance as well
T00:45   50 mg dph
Starting to feel the robocough took dph for itch
T01:00 600 mg lyrica
Robocough becoming apparent now took lyrica as another potentiator and bc I love the high
T01:30 25 mg Vicodin 
barely felt lyrica, robo is hitting me good 
T01:45 20 mg ritalin 10 mg orally 10 mg snorted 
Buzzing off the lyrica getting tired, not much boost in energy but get the tingles in my head
T02:30 25mg vicodin
 Was surprised to feel so warm and fuzzy off such a low dose, I’m grinning ear to ear tryna type but occasionally forgetting everything I was doing, the ritalin was keeping me from keeping at this point as the effects from it were so subtle the lyrica robo and vicodin just felt to good not to make the most of it
T03:00 Yerbamate 150 mg caffeine a coffee ??mg
I know the second dose hasn’t hit much yet but I start to nod, it worried me how often I was going out of it, my friends would try to talk to me and shake me to wake me up like 2-3x every five minutes, was worried the next dose would be dangerous, the caffeine barely helped anything but made me feel safer
T03:45 
Everything’s fully kicked in, I am constantly nodding off having funny hypnagogic dreams, I was watching archer and thought it was about a sandwich or something and it made sense until I was woken up 
T04:00 went ham on dab pen
This just put me in another state of fucked up I could barely move or keep my head up I hadn’t felt this euphoric since my first dose ever I cried, I was having the most blissful experience ever 

I will not add anymore from here as nothing interesting happened, if you read it thanks lmao I just needed to share this with everyone because it turned a months worth of bullshit into an amazing night of no worries or problems

My jaw dropped I said wtf and asked him why he never told me he could get them. He said he didn’t know and we laughed for a minute. I took my wallet out and handed him cash to go get me some OC. 

An hour later “Bambi” was blowing my phone up. I call her back and she tells me “Bob doesn’t know that OCs are code for H and I don’t really get OCs. Call him and tell him you don’t want them or my guy is gonna come over with H and Bob can’t see what it really is!!!!” 

So this whole time when she calls her guy or has Bob call her guy for OC ... it’s not. He’s bringing H. 

I called Bob told him to forget it and just get me whatever percs he can find. He’s a nice old guy and he said he was so happy to get me OCs and asking why I changed my mind. I don’t know if he’s on to her or not but I just kept it cool and told him his OC guy takes too long.

We even invited over some friends, Projectile Vomiting, and Good Ole Shitty Britches. I was preparing myself for another awful day after all my plugs confirmed that there’s no movement until tomorrow morning. I usually hate Facebook but I am stuck on the couch and saw a friend of a friend pop up in messenger that I know is in the game. My dope sickness made me cut past the small talk and I asked if he was open for business. Took a few for him to respond because somehow he didn’t know I use even though I look like a walking stereotypical junkie, except I own a house and manage a water company. Not only is he open for business but we actually live in the same neighborhood now. And he was excited to have a new customer with a daily habit and a way to pay for it. This is the second weekend in a row that I have gotten lucky with new connects. Just in time too because I am taking my kids to a fair tomorrow and I can’t be at peak withdrawals. I am getting clean after I enjoy this g because I know my luck is going to run out.

Mainly oxycodone, a bit of H here and there, etc. Once every second week on average, so I have little if any tolerance. 30mg of oxy gets me wrecked. 


Up until recently I’d never really heard of suboxone / subutex, until today while having a chat with a friend that was ‘smashed as fuck on bupe’. He gave me an 8mg strip to try it out, but googling hasn’t had answers to the questions I have, in fact it’s created more lol 


Does it get you high if you’re a non-tolerant user? What if you’re an addict? If so, what does it feel like? 


What’s the purpose of Naloxone being in it? Is it just to deter abuse? If so, how? As far as I know bupe isn’t effected by naloxone to a significant extent. My friend snorts it or puts it under his tongue, which would also lead to the naloxone being absorbed. Considering the very low BA of oral naloxone, what happens if you eat the strip? 


Why is it given to addicts if it gets you high? Is it to safely taper or another reason? 


I think that’s all I’ve got for now, I’ll edit if more questions come to mind. Thanks in advance for any information!

This is the first time I've had taken Zubsolv since I've last stopped taking dope 3ish weeks ago. Had 'em before, no complaints. A little confusion about the size of the dosage. Is the 5.7mg really the same as 8mg due to a formulation which facilitates more efficient absorption? This very post might just shed light on that question. 


&nbsp;

Been on a consistent 2mg dose for over a week. I was mostly taking the 8mg stop signs and cutting them up into quarters with the help of a pill cutter. These pills often crumble easily when using anything less suited for the task. Since I'm using a Sunday to Saturday compartmental pill case, I can easily store crumbs if I don't get a perfectly clean cut with the enclosed blade apparatus. 


&nbsp;

I typically put each pill or it's crumbs directly into one of the seven compartments but I will sometimes use a small amount of foil for the more pulverized of the bunch. This is to prevent the dust from disappearing through the cracks in the clicking door-like covers and other unforseeables. If I had strips instead of pills, although I've been known to stick strips straight into their respective compartments, I almost always wrap them in a small folded piece of foil. To protect the strips from light and localized atmospherics.


&nbsp;


Well, about an hour and a half after my dose, 1/4 of a 5.7mg Zubsolv, I feel fine. A little buzzy too, I don't know if I'd actually call it a buzz, but like I said - buzzy. Yeah, a light buzz seemed to come on stronger for a brief moment. It has some legs.


Point is, maybe this stuff really does absorb more efficiently or perhaps it is stronger. Maybe there's another factor at play here.

&nbsp;


As many here are aware, Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. Once you go above a certain dose, it doesn't feel any stronger the more you take because it blocks itself due to the way it goes or stays in our receptors. I'm sure that this explaination overlooks something in brain chemistry. Such as how certain doses promotes the body to convert or produce ""norbuprenorphine"".


Not sure of the signifigance of that very last part but I do *believe* it has something to do with endorphins.

&nbsp;


What I am sure of is that (assuming I'm not in WD from shorter acting opis) when I take more than 4mg of Suboxone I feel a little nauseous. That sometimes when I take a 2mg I get strongly energetic and it lasts all day. I feel a kind like it came on faster and stronger than when I take more than 3mg in general. Not 100% sure but based partly on this, I don't think I want to take more than 1/4 of a Zub in the future. 


&nbsp;

A critical part of today's test is not to re-dose on the zub or regular subs. Simply ride it out. My hypothesis is that I'll feel fine at work for my whole shift all the way up until bed time. I suspect that the zub chemistry will contribute to a good night's sleep. That it won't run out of steam early, it might not have ""legs"" in a few hours but all will be well and energy levels will be normal.


I do feel someting right now... I gotta keep an eye on this sensation, see if I feel this way next time I take a normal sub of the same dosage.

&nbsp;


Best case, as I said the day goes by and I get a good night's sleep.



Worst case, it doesn't last the whole day and I somehow get really yawny. Unlikely for a multitude of reasons, at least it wouldn't be due to any form of WD. 


&nbsp;

Hopes. I hope that the stronger sensation I'm feeling doesn't result in some unplanned after effects or symptoms. Like a withdrawal. I also feel compelled to research what the deal is with Zubsolv. It is necessary for me to find out everything possible as I am worried that this formulation could derail my taper plan. I must know more in order to ensure I'm doing everything possible to avoid more discomfort than is necessary if and when I continue to taper lower.",1532198457.0

Nearly OD'd and quit, thought I'd learned my lesson. Around my birthday last month I got hit with a wave of depression and linked back up with the dealer. Have been slipping and sliding off and on now for several weeks until this past Monday. 

It was a day to day struggle this past week keeping the thoughts out, simultaneously telling myself this is a road to nowhere good one minute, then rationalizing the next. I'd stayed good this whole week, but I had left the door ajar by not deleting the dealer's contact from my phone. He calls this morning and my heart sinks as I see his number. I literally answer without any plan or thought in place of how I was going to handle it. He asked me ""what was up?"". This may sound really cliche but it almost felt like a moment suspended in time. I was stopped dead in my tracks, torn between avoiding a lonely boring Saturday with an easy short term fix, and doing what I knew needed to be done. To my now shock, I just started talking and said ""yeah man, I just need to quit, it's not good for me. Nothing personal. Take care and don't expect to hear from me again"". He said he understood and hung up. I stood in shock for a moment of what I'd actually just done. Then before any good could be undone or I could leave myself an easy out, I systematically erased any way for me to contact him, or him to contact me from my phone. (I know technically he could one day call me from a new number, but it was the best I could do and I told him he wouldn't hear from me again, so I think he will hopefully respect that and not contact me from different numbers down the road).

So I share this not hiding the fact that it feels good to revel in a personal victory, but also hopefully as encouragement to others out there struggling. Of course it's not a battle that is won in 30 seconds, but you do have it in you to make massive decisions that can alter your life within you. Much love, fam. ",1532197461.0

My metabolism is average, I’m 25 year old male, 6”2 180 pounds. No liver or kidney problems. Also, what can I do to get it out of my system faster? Thank you so much.

Edit: Idk if this matters but it wasn’t tar. It was east coast powder/rock dope. Pretty good quality but not fire. Will update everyone after the test. 

::edit:: I passed my test no problem with a little 90 hours clean",1532182626.0

Really scared.,"What’s up r/opiates? I have been out of rehab (for the 11th time) since November of last year. I was on Drug Court when I first got home and only by the grace of God got off of it and received non-adjudication probation. 

The first thing I did when I knew I didn’t have drug tests was get some Suboxone filled from my left over prescription. Sweet RELIEF. I knew that I had sold my sole, because I didn’t have the money to stay on. 

I paid my doctor visits and paid for everything else, allegedly, by selling drugs. Mainly Suboxone. 

Fast forward to now after going back and forth between 2 doctors I’m virtually out of Suboxone and I don’t know what to do. 

Opiates are the only drug that I ever was highly addicted to. I’ve been clean off Heroin over a year and all other opiates 11 months. I have used other drugs within this time frame, but no opiates other than Sub.

My question: What the hell am I going to do about the cravings without Suboxone and knowing that I have nothing blocking my receptors?

I have school aid coming (cash) and I started taking my psych meds again. I’m just out of it and hope I don’t relapse. 

From somebody who has been on and off Suboxone/Subutex since I was 18. If you are considering Suboxone. It has BAD side effects.

- COMPLETE loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, inorgasmia and it’s super hard to pee. Your dick is basically useless.
- Sweating like a French hooker. Perspiration.
- Complete lack of interest in hobbies, money, girls, music and friends
- Fatigue and tiredness. 
- Loss of appetite

Suboxone doesn’t give you any buzz and makes your dick completely stop working JUST so you won’t crave opiates. Sacrificing your dick because you don’t have will power.

Honestly after reading over those side effects I’m glad I’m turning a new page in my life. I’m going to get some Kratom and Benzos and just tough it out I guess guys. Wish me luck.",1532181590.0

A decade later and good luck getting any painkillers.

Well that obviously isn't going to cut it when twice a week I have to spend the evening laying flat out the ground to help the pain, and eventually the back pain turns into a migraine and I'm pretty much done for the day. I'm in my fucking 20s and planning a wedding while lying on the ground in pain regularly, and this is how I am supposed to survive??? When I'm about to marry the love of my life, and all I can think about is how I just want it all to end. I just want to be able to live a life worth living.

So no doctor will even take me seriously or prescribe anything (especially after mentioning that CBD lotion helps me a TON, and I'm in a legal state). Ok, well I'm not ready to give up on life, so I've been trying every muscle relaxer and opiate and NMDA antagonist under the sun to help bring me some temporary peace. MXE was a godsend, but that's gone now.

Of course all this shit is illegal and expensive, so now half my paycheck goes to buying packs of 20mg Roxicodone that I sometimes take at night to function. I regularly volunteer at a needle exchange and standing for hours really hurts my midback, so the other night I had to take 60mg over the evening just to be able to sit on the couch and plan my own wedding. That's almost $100 in pills, depending on your source, just for an evening of feeling ""alright"". Are you fucking kidding me?

I've never used heroin or injected anything, nor am I trying to cure opiate withdrawals. This is just how my body is. These are the cards I was dealt. And America's solution? Go buy pills from your local neighborhood drug dealer and hope it isn't fent! But the price is insane! Oh, but heroin is cheaper... Maybe I could just switch to that and be responsible like everyone else thought they could? 

It's fucking ridiculous, and I know I'm preaching to the choir but it seems no one else has a fucking ear to listen anymore. All I want to do is live my life without being immobilized. I just want something to look forward to besides the end. I want to love and live, without squinting in agony.

Edit: I do use a Kratom tincture regularly and it does help immensely for the constant dull achy pain. Getting an MRI is my next step, but I know that I can't get anything from pain management because I'll test dirty on the UA because I use CBD/thc regularly for pain. 

A while ago I sent my mom, who has horrible neuropathic pain, some medicated lotion and it helped her Sooo much, but then she popped dirty on her urine test and got a strike. So now she can't use it again and is back to opiates.",1532132114.0
