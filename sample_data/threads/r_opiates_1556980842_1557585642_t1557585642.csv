I am using opiates since two years on weekends.
Used Oxycodone mostly. The oxy euphoria is amazing. Used Tramadol, Oxy, Dillys etc. and always had an amazing euphoria/rush. I got my hands on various Heroin samples. Lab tested them and they were 75% Heroin without any lace materials. So no bad quality.

I smoked it several times and never got any euphoria from it at all. The tramadol euphoria was even stronger. The body high and pain kill was there and my head was heavy, but why didn't I get any euphoria from it?",1557580521.0

Y‚Äôall have seen me post about tramadol before and how much I love it and it‚Äôs changed my life. (in case you haven‚Äôt - yes I‚Äôve tried stronger opiates, and yes they‚Äôre lovely, but I need to be on something all day every day and stronger stuff requires too much titration to be sustainable over decades;  I‚Äôm 34 w a bunch of chronic pain issues).

So yesterday I finally got the nerve, after months of trying, to ask her to increase my dose by +1/day (+30/month). It had been almost 2 years since my last increase. 

I stated reasons why I felt it would help: I get really burnt out by the end of the day as a SAHM w a toddler, and would like more pain-free time and energy to play w kiddo and husband when he gets home rather than going to hide in my bedroom, smoke weed, and sleep to avoid pain. 

She not only agreed to the increase, but she also said she thinks I could get an added ‚Äúmood boost‚Äù and relief from adding Cymbalta on top of the tramadol. She said people primarily think of it as an antidepressant but that she has a lot of other chronic pain patients who‚Äôve had great success with it, and if I don‚Äôt like it after 1month I can stop it, it‚Äôs just an idea to help. 

I love her, for real.

This is all just to say that there ARE still doctors who will work with you and you don‚Äôt have to be afraid to ask for more pain relief. I told her I‚Äôve been anxious about asking ‚Äúbecause of the current climate around pain medicine, I didn‚Äôt know if me asking would trigger some kind of problem behind the scenes‚Äù. She was super understanding, and said ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a prominent issue in the media right now, and it can be tough to talk about‚Äù. 

I hope you all find a doctor that‚Äôs equally cool and compassionate and humane to write you legit scripts for everything you need, and no one here ever has to be dopesick again. Love y‚Äôall.


(Ps for anyone who‚Äôs curious, I‚Äôm now on 50mg x2/dose, 3x per day - so that‚Äôs 6pills/day, 180/month. I‚Äôve been on tramadol for the better part of 13 years and have rarely had to increase dosage in order to maintain relief, just because I got lucky w genetics in terms of it working really well on me).",1557580156.0

I just wanted to ask all of you what you experience as mental/emotional/spiritual symptoms when you WD, especially cold turkey. For me, on the first day almost a far-too-familiar sense of deep depression takes over my mood, then I slowly start to fade into a point by day 2 that I feel emotional pain physically and what's worse is the kind of horrible bullshit that comes popping right back at you in the form of sad or painful memories like your mind is torturing you and you feel absolutely no relief. You might continue to shake around in bed or fall asleep of exhaustion, have 1-2 hours of nightmares and then be woken up suddenly again, exhausted, scared, sad and absolutely confused.  
 
I'm trying to mostly negate the physical symptoms which we all know all too well about already, I think. But the emotional and mental state that WD can put you in is brutal and unimaginable, in and of itself anyway. By Day 3 the psychosis kicks in and you soon start wondering to yourself whether you'll survive this without harm this time and try to remind yourself of friends who've OD'd and you say you'd rather not do that but many in a similar situation, if offered any amount or form of opiates, would probably take it since their rational judgement, weakened from the WDs and psychosis, is not strong enough anymore to refuse anyway. 
 

Then the sweet relief - for most of us - when finally, after a 3-day long tolerance break you dose right and proper, hitting that perfect golden little spot of yours and nodding along peacefully, then falling into a long comfortable sleep like you haven't slept for a hundred years. Just to wake up in WDs again.
 

Anyways, thanks for reading that I guess. I could ramble on but I'll leave that for you, I'm sure there are many people on here who can relate to this on many levels. So go ahead. Cheers.",1557574126.0

I've never done heroin, but I have snorted hydromorphone a few times though. I've had tramadol, codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, dried flower/seed extractions, kratom, u-47... I know what the opioid experience is but it sounds like the rush of shooting up is a completely unique experience separate from the opioid high.

Should I just leave it a mystery? I've used opioids occasionally without any addiction issues for over a decade now because I know how much damage they can do.

Still... I can't shake the curiosity of the infamous 'rush'. It doesn't help that I've been listening to ""heroin"" by the velvet underground a lot lately. Have I already experienced the equivalent snorting hydromorphone or are they completely different?

I've been a participant on this sub off and on for a couple of years now. Don't want this post to get dragged down too much talking about how I got here, but pretty typical story. Spent most of my mid 20's and early 30's chipping on prescription opioids, managing to keep my addiction mostly my own dirty secret. Got married in 2014 to someone who also had addiction issues and while it wasn't the only factor, our individual struggles and how we viewed our addictions (both of us thought the other had the bigger problem) def helped bring down the relationship. While going through the divorce in 2016 I decided to get clean and get my life back on track. Well about a year ago this past March I sank into a deep bout of depression and after 18 months off opiates did the thing I thought I'd never do, which was turn to Heroin (fentanyl really). 


I just about od'd last March and fessed up about my struggles to my family about how far I'd fallen. I was convinced I was truly done and had reached bottom, but ya'll know how that goes. Most of 2018 was spent using for a few weeks, hating myself and vowing to never do it again, getting clean for a few weeks, rinse and repeat. I quit back in late October and tossed out the dealer's phone number, told him I was quitting and all that. Was going alright then couple months ago got laid off from work and totaled my car all within a month's time. Found myself having to live back at home with my parent's again age 37 since I only had unenemployment checks and no car. I'd still managed to remain clean since the job loss but since moving back home I've just been struggling more with dealing with where I'm at in my life, and while my folks were out of town this week I found myself back at the dealer's doorstep buying dope and tossing away another 6 months of clean time. 

It wasn't even enjoyable. The dude has only ever had what I suspect is fent analogue cut up shit, not like downing pure oxy's and getting a good nod. I'd feel kinda that heavy opiate sedation for an hour or so then have to redose and end up feeling worse effects the more I took and end up puking my guts up without even feeling like I ever got that nice euphoria from the old days.

It's a weird place to be at because part of the trouble with my mind being focused on opiates all the time is not having a job and nothing really going on in my life to occupy my thoughts. Also just being really dissatisfied with where I'm at and kind of stuck in this rut, not believing things are going to get better. At the same time as soon as I slipped again I quickly lost interest because like I said I don't even enjoy this fent shit.  Sorry to ramble like this, I swore this post wouldn't end up a mess of thoughts but I think for me I just needed to write this somewhere, even if nobody really reads it or responds. In this moment I just really want to feel comfort from others who understand this shit. Maybe somebody has some wise words. I def believe others perspectives make a huge difference even when you know in the back of your mind what you need to do or what the answers are, you just need someone else to say it to you.

My story starts about 3 years ago. Destroyed my ankle in a crash. Tore all the ligaments, nerve damage. Had ankle rebuilt. Was put on Oxycodone 5mg x 3 times per day.  Never really abused it, took it as scheduled. Went through physical therapy maintained about a 15mg per day use for a few months. Doubled up my dose every so often to enjoy the feeling.

About 1 year after the surgery the pain was all gone. I had amazing doctors who did a fantastic job. I was transferred to a pain management doctor after surgery where I just continued complaining to the doctor of pain and he continued me on 15mg per day for the fact that I wasn't increasing my dose. (At least he didn't think I was) so quick monthly checkups and renew the prescriptions for 90 x 5mg's

In reality, I was just buying the extra's from a connection I had. Money was of no concern. I held down my job and if anything there was an increase in my output and productivity.  I do work a stressful job 10+ hours per day. After a while, was concerned with my levels increasing and 50mg per day was my limit. I slowly weaned myself down to 40mg per day, then down to 30mg then 20mg. 20mg gave me a small, but decent boost during the day, but only lasted about 1-2 hours. I increased my dosage to the point where I found I could easily survive on 35-40mg per day and be happy with that feeling. I have 10mg pills, and would just break off a 5mg every few hours to keep me going. 

Job was good, life was good, family was good. Really no complaints. (except constipation. that was my only drawback.) No one knew about my 35-40mg day use. I felt ""high"" and enjoyed life. I never came close to od'ing. I've never nodded off. 

Money was not a problem, but it sucked spending an extra $2000 a month on pills for the past few years. I'm not going to lie. It was an expensive hobby.  Over the past month I weaned down to 35mg, then 25mg, then 20mg per day. 

I stopped cold turkey exactly 85 hours ago. I felt a little shitty day 1 and day 2. Today day 3, I say I'm about 80% fine. I did a lot of reading and was expecting decent withdrawals due to the amount of years  I was using. During the past 3 years I never missed a single day of taking an opiate. These past 85 hours have been the longest I've been off of pills and I fucking miss them like crazy.

I'm not missing them in the sense where I feel sick and need them to feel normal or well. I miss them in the sense that if I take them I will just feel better and enjoy my day more. The withdrawals weren't that bad. Way easier than I expected. So I now know I can get off them if I need to again in the future.  I want to go back on my 35-40mg dose to be happy. 

After I was 36 hours clean (when I realized the withdrawals weren't going to be that terrible), I flushed my remaining pills down the toilet, told myself I was done spending money on them. My only drawback to using was the cost. There was no other repercussion in my life. I can afford to pay $2000 a month. I just don't want to any more because I know they are not good for me, and I know it's a waste of money.

I'm depressed not because of withdrawals. Not because I feel sick.  I'm depressed because I know if I take the pills again I'll be happier. I know I can survive as a functioning addict. 

I have no intentions of going back to using. But I just really, really want to.",1557552752.0

""Welp, here goes.""

*Cue me shooting the 60 units of blood and immediately getting goosebumps all up my arms. My eyes widening at the realization I've just made a huge mistake.*

So I forgot that the rigs that I used the blood from, were mostly meth shots. And to those who don't know, meth is heavy, so it tends to rest at the bottoms of rigs. The same bottoms I scraped for hours. And I'm a tad sensitive to stimulants... So I did not have a good time.

For the first time in my life, I prayed to God. I prayed to my mother. I sent my guilt, regret, and apology through the clouds that sat a half country between us, and hoped it was enough. Counting each breath, I tried not to sob too hard, because it hurt. I tried not to hyperventilate too much, because that hurt too. Everything hurt. Everything was pain. I had never felt that kind of fear while wanting to die so much. 

So lesson, or TLDR, don't shoot the old blood of other people's meth shots to get well. It doesn't work and makes you feel worse. 

Also, can you shoot gabapentin? I may have developed a slight needle fixation..",1557544476.0

I'm sorry if this question is misleading. I just figured I'd ask you all since you are some of the most honest people I've ever talked to.

So, it was my sophomore year in college when I met this girl. I never pursued a relationship with her because of my health concerns and just poor self esteem in general; I thought I would hurt her and this prevented me from acting on my feelings. My health issues haven't gotten any better since college, but I was wondering if it was too late for me to try and pursue some kind of realtionship with her. 

It has been five years since we have talked, and I would be fine with us just catching up; she was one of my good friends, and I've missed her dearly since graduating. I'm not sure how to approach her though. I've been in relationships since then, but I've never been this nervous just trying to talk to someone. She's been in relationships too and lives in D.C. while I live in the Midwest. I'm an elementary teacher that is currently in remission from small bowel cancer if this matters any.

Should I even bother her?

I do apologize for this cry baby post. I just needed to get this off my chest, and I hope that someone will be able to give me some sound advice.

Yours,

New to this sub. Hope you're all well. I don't have much experience with subs or even opiates for that matter so I thought I'd ask you all on here. You lot seem to be much more knowledgeable than the docs anyway when it comes to harm reduction. I don't think docs will ever understand the pain we go through.

Anyway, I'm using subs to kick a light opiate habit. My dosing schedule is like this over the course of 1 week... 0.8mg, 0.7mg, 0.6mg etc. I might not even let it run the full week so I may test the waters at 5 days. I started on Wednesday morning with my first 0.8mg dose. These low doses are enough to keep most of the withdrawals at bay believe it or not.

I'm well aware of the dangers of using subs long term and how horrific they are to quit. Not from personal experience, but from hearing the stories on here. You could say I'm pretty scared of them. My question is, do you think I will run into any problems using this method at such low doses and for a short duration? I really don't want to make matters worse.

I think of Polly Anne, kneeling next to John Henry's body.   
Did her thoughts turn, like me, towards the salesman? 

John Henry was born a slave.   
They say he worked himself to death because he knew  
a steam drill would make his body disposable.   
If I can‚Äôt salvage your heart next time   
I‚Äôll lay your corpse out in the California hills. 

Your cell walls will dissolve. 

Your eyes will be reticulated by threads of fungus.   
Eventually, the world will crush your flesh into a mountain of coal.   
A new company can run trains under that, too.   
They‚Äôll build railway for children to play next to

and wait for their bodies to get ill enough to sell.

I was inspired to write this out of anger.  I read the full 300 pages of a NY State Lawsuit against Perdue. It's disgusting. They directly market NARCAN to people with opioid scripts, because ""*pain treatment and opioid addiction are naturally linked*"". Apparently, flooding the market with opioids  made a great business opportunity  to be an ""*end to end provider*"".

Obviously premature ejaculation is a well known side effect of withdrawal, and as the brain heals, so will that. When I am on half a sub and up my dick works fine, any lower than that and it's a one pump chump. I am 31 years old and have never had any preformance issues, I mean I can go for hours sober most of the time. I wouldn't really care normally and would just ride it out, but I have been in a relationship for 3 years with an amazing woman. She has never done a drug in her life and she isn't bothered that my junk is malfunctioning, she just wants me to get better and healthy. I, however, do care. It really bothers me that I can't satisfy her right now. Like I said, she claims she doesn't care but there will be times like when we wake up in the morning and start being all cute and doofy and then we both get turned on, and I will become super anxious because I wanna do right by her but I know that since I haven't had the stupid sub my components will short circuit as soon as that switch is flipped. It stresses me out so much. And usually I will diffuse the situation, and she will know why and be supportive and compassionate about it, but still.


I guess I wanna know if the subs will impede my cock recovery. Does my brain have to be completely devoid of opiates of any kind to get there? Are there suppliments that help or techniques? Is it possible the opiates wrecked my testosterone (I don't think so but maybe?)?


Any insight or even just talking about similar experiences would be super helpful and appreciated. My goal is to be off the subs in two months.

It‚Äôs cut only once if once at all he is the same plug I had when I was 17. Now idk if it‚Äôs because of the ECP/fent use or what but me and my girl have to do ungodly huge shots. Believe me or not we  load 1.5g-grams in our cooker PER SHOT! Rig literally full 100units of straight tar... that‚Äôs if we wanna catch a nice like solid nod... but not like it used to be. When I‚Äôd do .2 of ECP and be nodding damn near incoherent. I realized when an old buddy who uses once in a blue moon came over 2 nights ago. He was nervous cause he hadn‚Äôt used in 2 years so he wanted to start with .2 so he did it slammed it and my heart just about sunk... the kid didn‚Äôt OD but he was RIGHT THERE like right on the edge like ‚Äúkeep talking bud‚Äù sort of high and it was the exact same chunk of tar we threw in our cooker ... at that point I realized my tolerance is fucking insane... and my girls... mine is quite a bit higher.

If I understand correctly (from conversations I've overheard in rehab, movies, etc), there was a point in time where no one really had to worry about fentanyl, highly cut/weak dope, or pressed pills (correct me if I'm wrong). And in this time I imagine opiates were also easier to obtain since pharmaceutical companies were literally giving doctors samples of opiates to give their patients and persuading them to prescribe stuff like Oxycontin more often.

Anyway. So... yeah. There is a private opiates subreddit that I created last summer. It is a MUCH smaller, intimate, personal, and tight knit group... it's a family. It has some different rules than r/opiates - but it surely does not allow anything sourcey so dont even bother.  I am the main moderator there as well as creator but u/spinderella69 also has mod powers there. 


1. Were a pretty lax group but we absolutely don't allow any sourcey stuff. 

2. We also dont allow memes. Images are allowed, but the group is primarily for actual discussion. Not shit posting. 

3. It is members only. Only approved submitters may post, comment, or even able to view the content. 

4. Participation is huge and highly encouraged. Lurkers are not really welcomed overall and will end up being booted over time when noticed. So dont join if you ain't gonna talk 

5. Discussion is very personal and more free there since its private. Drug talk is the main thing typically however any topics of discussion are allowed within rules. 
 

6. The full rules of the sub are in the pinned post there so if added PLEASE READ or end up booted if you fuck up


Any other questions etc please just ask me personally. I'm not going to link the sub here so please dont ask. If you're serious about wanting to join a tight knit community with more free and personal discussion, a sense of a family vibe, actually participate at least here and there, and  be cool... hit me up and request admission.

I really appreciate the replies & well wishes! I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. 

Hello! First ever post. Mobile user, sorry for any formatting issues that may be present. Apologies in advance for the length of this post!!

Background & current problem: I am on fentanyl patches for severe complex chronic pain. I recently switched from an oral narcotic pain medication (I still also have oral breakthrough narcotic opioid meds,) to fentanyl transdermal. Yesterday I switched out my second to last patch, & completely botched it. I‚Äôm absurdly clumsy, & it was a series of unfortunate events due to my being uncoordinated‚Äî I placed the patch, it fell off, I picked it up, dropped it, picked it up but somehow folded it nearly in half on the sticky side, spent a good 30 minutes carefully trying to unfold/unstick it but instead tore & warped the plastic, only to not successfully separate it from itself & make it unwearable. I placed it back into the slip that it comes in, & wrote my doctor yesterday, immediately after realizing there was no way to salvage it. I placed my last remaining patch on, which should have been placed on Saturday, then wrote my doctor informing him. I‚Äôm extremely careful, but my chronic illnesses & disability makes me prone to movement/motor skill related disaster. I offered to bring in the patch that I fucked up, & apologized for the mishap. It‚Äôs Thursday today, & I have yet to hear back from my doctor. That isn‚Äôt unusual, but as I‚Äôd need the hard copy prescription in hand by tomorrow in order to fill by Saturday, I‚Äôm becoming anxious. My doctor appears to be out of town or at least not in the clinic‚Äî a different rx of mine was filled by another doctor at my hospital just today. 

I always am diligently adhering to my medication directions (I used to struggle with misusing/abusing my opioids/opiates, as well as having a history of H & oxycodone addiction, but haven‚Äôt in 8 years! I‚Äôm very proud of this, as I did it on my own,) so this situation makes me extremely anxious. I‚Äôm only on a two month trial on the fentanyl transdermal. I hate it (it is not adequately managing my pain,) but I‚Äôm pushing through. 

Disposing of used patches is complicated because of where I live, so I have kept them in a security sealed Tupperware-like container after removal, so that I can turn them in the disposal collection when I next refill. 

My question is: if the fentanyl prescription cannot be filled by Saturday, would it be safe or advisable to wear previously worn patches that I have saved for disposal? Just until the following Tuesday, when I would be getting a refill? I know they contain more fentanyl than a 72 hour dose. Or, will just powering through a 3-4 day withdrawal be best? 

Opioid/opiate withdrawal is no stranger to me, but I‚Äôd rather not have to go through that. I just feel very anxious, both because the pain I am already in will worsen significantly without the patches, & about whether my hospital/doctor will see this as me trying to pull one on him. 

Additionally, I‚Äôd really like to switch back to the MS Contin I‚Äôd been on. I saw my doctor two weeks ago, & without getting into my medical history, we decided to make a few other medication adjustments & see if they triggered the issues that I‚Äôd had that we suspected may have been from the MS Contin or another, non narcotic med, & thought another month would be a good idea. I was on board with that at the time, but now it seems that is WAS the non narcotic med that was causing these side effects, & I‚Äôd much rather go back to the morphine. I‚Äôm afraid of pushing it, with my doctor out of the office , & with now being short on my fentanyl‚Äî & because it‚Äôs so short notice.

If anyone has ANY advice, I‚Äôd be extraordinarily grateful! Thank you in advance, & apologies for the excess of information/wall of text.",1557437359.0

I think I‚Äôm def in a minority when it comes to stoners in this sub. I may be wrong. But I digress....

Like most of you, I am a dope lover, specifically ECP‚Äî with, very frequently, fentanyl. I am also a breed of user that has grown to prefer and specifically cop fent, although I am a sniffer and have never IV‚Äôd. Come March of this year I found myself horribly addicted to fentdope‚Äî or whatever I kept on poisoning myself with (it literally felt like that) being sold in a very large open air drug market on the East coast as heroin

At that point, I could sniff 20 (more if I could have afforded) stamps in 5 minutes and not even feel right. Like, I wouldn‚Äôt even get WELL. In the beginning, a simple bag had me on another planet for a day. My withdrawal has always been atypical‚Äî I‚Äôve never gotten the shits, or started throwing up. I just feel all the muscle and bone pain, and I am sweating but freezing, and unable to sit still, unable to function or sleep


I always thought W/D‚Äôs from heroin or fent came on quickly, like 6-12 hours after last use, but for me they almost always started after a full 24 hours 

Like, this week‚Äî I used a day, then not the next day. Then the following 2-3 days I used. Then skipped a day, felt fine all day, but by next morning I was sick. Used later that day, then stopped the next day and next day, no sickness

Wtf is up with this? My withdrawals are so unpredictable I‚Äôm almost thinking it‚Äôs my mental withdrawal that makes me feel or think I am physically dopesick. Or like, I never kicked subs entirely after I took them for a month after rehab, just went back to using, so is this me coming off all the opiates? Even though at this point I haven‚Äôt eaten subs in 2-4 weeks?

I‚Äôm starting to think my withdrawal is just my mind playing games on me, but there‚Äôs no denying how sick I really felt and how not functioning I was when I had to go to detox. I just snapped. No money, no future, an unbeatable tolerance‚Äî couldn‚Äôt do it anymore

Either that, or I‚Äôm being sold shit like heroin, 18 different fent analogues, tranquilizer, benzos, because you really never can tell what‚Äôs in the bag, although as I said I cop in a major US city known for having a drug supply

Idk, like I said I‚Äôm stoned and was just wondering if anyone has experienced really unpredictable withdrawal symptoms or timing l. Like, sometimes you get sick when you take breaks (because I never ‚Äú‚Äùreally‚Äù‚Äù quit, either) 

Like I really woke up sick this week in bad withdrawal and now I know my dad is coming to visit so I stopped using for 12-24 hours and so far so good. No sickness‚Äî wtf is up with that? Do I not really even have any physical tolerance? Nah that‚Äôs impossible, because I‚Äôve been using dope and/or subs on and off for a year so far in this run

Anyways, I‚Äôm not using today but happy nods to everyone and may Junkie Jesus bless you alllllll

I soaked 90mg this morning and plan to take it later after about 8 hrs. It will be 48 hrs no kratom, and I'm hoping most of yesterday's morphine will be out of my system.

I helped her through getting off of them.

Anyways, I have a strong gut feeling that things haven‚Äôt been right for like the past year with her.

She always finds a reason to leave the house for hours, while saying she won‚Äôt be gone long. 
She would sometimes return with this odd chemically smell on her that I cannot pinpoint. When I ask about the smell, she says she doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about or what it could be.

She sometimes has black smudges on her face, or on her fingers. 
She sleeps a lot, coming home from work saying she is tired, and just falls asleep so quickly, mouth open.

Complains about constipation frequently.
Skips out on coming to visit my family with me. Mostly because something comes up with work.

There was this time a few months ago, where I told her I was going to drug test her, she grew defensive, and her behavior was very negative about me wanting to test her, which I get that, I too got defensive when I was in my teens and my aunt and grandmother wanted to test me because they suspected I was smoking pot. I admitted that I was smoking pot and there was no need to test me, but they then assumed that I was using other drugs. So I succumbed to the test.
Anyway, her behavior was just very defensive and obstinate towards taking the test, then when she did, we sat for five minutes waiting for the result which came out negative, and her demeanor totally changed, like happy I told you so, not doing anything.

Another instance was just last year on Christmas, we went to California to visit her dads side of the family, and one day out there, it was like the third day we were out there, she was so withdrawn from everything, and complained about aching muscles, and nausea, just staying in bed all day.
Then the next day, she said we had to leave back home to Arizona because she needed to get back to work early, so she convinced me to change our flight to that very same day.

Her dad mentioned something about her behavior, something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with her? Does she need another fix?‚Äù

That was just a red flag waving so ferociously in my face. 
I asked her about her behavior and how I was concerned, I was just met with denial.

Every time I try to speak to her about my concerns or ask her about it, I‚Äôm always stonewalled with denial, and somewhat ridiculous solutions to satiate my suspicions, such as ‚ÄúDo you want to follow me every time I go somewhere?‚Äù Things like that, I can‚Äôt thing of more examples at the moment.

I‚Äôm frequently questioning if I am just forcing the puzzle pieces together to fit the picture that I see.
But my intuition is beckoning me constantly that there is something up.

I don‚Äôt know how to find out for sure, or how to approach the situation effectively.

It‚Äôs starting to weigh on my conscious heavily, and it‚Äôs breaking my heart.",1557420796.0

I haven‚Äôt posted here in a long time, I used to be around quite a bit but after I decided enough was enough and quit doing dope I left. Anyways.

I‚Äôll be having a Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) on 3 different disc in my neck. I‚Äôve been living with this for over a year to no avail with alternative treatment modalities. 

I understand I need to stop taking the Subutex about 3-5 days before surgery. Is this enough time if I‚Äôve been on 16mg for about 5 months or should I allow longer? I do not want anything to happen before or during or after surgery. 

I‚Äôm worried about telling the anesthesiologist for fear of not receiving proper pain management after surgery. Obviously I‚Äôll tell the doctors but I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be judged and not given proper care. I‚Äôm not looking to get juiced up with a bunch of drugs because as soon as I‚Äôm done with everything I plan on going right back to the subutex. I just want to be comfortable and not in pain after surgery and during recovery.

Also, will I require stronger pain medications because I‚Äôve been on subutex for so long? 

I plan on having my girlfriend dispense my medication while I am recovering at home and have told the doctor I only want 1 prescription with minimal amounts to get me through and to authorize no refills. 

I‚Äôm very nervous about this surgery and if anyone can offer some insight or whatever it would be greatly appreciated.",1557418271.0

So many of the discrepancies were chalked up to poor diet, bad sleeping habits, depression and anxiety. Some of these were symptoms and the others were the cause of his use.

I was a happy girl although I had my fair share of issues. Being love and attention starved were a couple. Overall I was a naive, loving, carefree teenager. We met, and it was a whirlwind. Almost immediately I felt like I loved him. I loved that he was older, and much more experienced in life than me. Like a child, I innocently looked to him to lead me by the hand and teach me the ways of the world. 

The dream I had in mind was an illusion. He had a plethora of problems and usually, he took them out on me. I saw an injured bird. A bird that was so beautiful and magnificent that I couldn't help but try to nurse to health even though this bird would claw and peck at me. I wanted to care for him. To show him that I loved him and I was so fucking determined to not let him down like everyone else in his life had.

He was my first. For a lot of things. We got older together. I wanted his time and attention and he could never fill the hole in my heart even when times were good. There was a moment I distinctly remember, and I assume this was when his addiction began. We had just shared a beautiful and sweet moment of intimacy. It was always loving and always satisfying. We were like two puzzle pieces joining together when we had sex. He knew what I liked and I knew what he liked. But after he laid next to me, I felt like I didn't understand who he was as a person. I was right next to him but I felt we were a million miles apart. The tears flowed down my cheeks. He knew I was crying but he didn't say anything because I assume he felt exactly the same.

I'm not sure if we are soul mates. My love didn't fix him. It didn't stop him from using. His love felt like it was never enough. I was always hungry for more and more of it and he couldn't give it to me. But we connected. Deeply.

Everything turned into a mess. Then I found out the truth. He was addicted to heroin for the past 3 and a half years. I felt hurt. I felt a huge betrayal and a deep sting in my soul. He loved heroin over me. He cheated on me with heroin.

Every moment of the last several years repeated in my mind endlessly. The things that didn't add up suddenly made sense. The feeling of distance, the weeks and sometimes months without a word from him, asking to borrow a lot of money...the comments he made that I didn't understand.

I wanted to stay and still try to nurse him after I found out his dark secret. But I knew that I couldn't fix him. So, I had to stay away. This fact brings me to my knees on the bad days. And trust me, there are plenty.

The man I loved. The man I share a child with. The man who was my first for many things. The man who confided in me his unspeakable experiences of abuse when he was a child. The man who I tried so desperately to help.

I can't help him. I want to. And if I knew I could, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I let him down. I didn't stick around forever like I promised. And I proved his point that everyone leaves him eventually.

I'm not sure what happened. It's so easy to wonder and fixate. I want to know how it started. I feel hatred in my heart towards his friends who introduced him to the drugs. It's much easier to hate others who I have no ties to.

The pain addicts experience is unfathomable. It spirals out of control so easily. Some people can be occasional users and live normal, functioning lives. Some people can't swing it. And there are some in the middle. I'll never truly understand the hell that they go through. Only other people who have gone through similar experiences can fully relate. 

But, unless you've gone through it, no one knows how painful it is to love an addict.",1557372472.0

Pain.  Daily.  Use my right hand for everything.  Work, school... 30 page paper and working at a keyboard all day...  

So.  How to treat and deal with this pain when I am a junky for opioids.  Doc wrote me a script for Tylenol 3.  Most of the reason why I delayed going to the doc and pursuing this problem has to do with knowing junky me would try to wheedle opioids.  But I swung so hard in the other direction that I now have two fingers with zero cartilage and very limited mobility.  Permanent damage.  

The Tylenol 3 makes the pain bearable, down from a ten to a six or so.  And I am not inclined to chow down on them.  That‚Äôs a lie.  I just swallowed three trying to chase the dragon and of course it ain‚Äôt happening but my liver might explode.

So I‚Äôm a pain management patient, and get prescribed 90 15mg morphine pills a month. I‚Äôm supposed to take 1 pill 3x/day. 

I love a good nod just as much as the rest of us do! I‚Äôve found that with morphine, there‚Äôs a great euphoric body rush that kicks in about 10 minutes (max) after I swallow the pills, but will not last more than 15-20 minutes and then I just get the benefits of actual pain relief lol. But I‚Äôm trying to make it last longer and maybe get a good nod out of it too.

I usually take about 45-60mg at a time, sometimes more than that too. But I don‚Äôt always get that great melty morphine feeling, which is super frustrating and disappointing.

I‚Äôve tried snorting them before, but I didn‚Äôt really get any type of high out of it, just nauseous. Before I started pain management, I was buying mbox 30s on the street and blowing 3-4 of them in one sitting...so I for sure have a tolerance.

I‚Äôm just trying to find the best way to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of these 90 pills a month without feeling like I wasted half the script. Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe different doses? Does anyone have any positive experience with snorting them? How can I make that euphoria last longer than 15 minutes?

Any and all help is greatly appreciated! Happy nods, fam!",1557367267.0

I want to say he stopped prescribing me even the norco around... late summer of 2018, and I've been more or less off everything since then (save for an occasional prescription or two). I had surgery almost a month ago, and I was given something like 8 norco (5/325), and my surgeon made a comment to my mom that there's some way to test the level of someone's opioid tolerance that ranks it on a scale of something like 0-1000, and apparently mine was pretty high up there. my regular doctor won't write me anything helpful, I don't have enough disposable income to buy from anyone (and I wouldn't know where to look anyway), and about the only thing I can occasionally do is actually use my green card and pick up something that'll help for a few hours, but really screw me if I need to take a drug test for a job application.

She now knows I take the benadryl and that I sleep more with them, I also take them as an anti allergica throughout the day and tell her I am because of them so damn tired.

How true is this? I've only ever taken up to 40mg at once.  


Also, I am planning on going from Suboxone to Methadone. What are the positive and negative aspects of being on Methadone versus Suboxone? I hate Suboxone, as I still have ***intense*** cravings, but when I do something, I don't feel it, unless I take 2.5-4x the normal dose. Does Methadone do the same thing? Is it dose-dependant?

bm5zjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bm5zjn/opioid_withdrawals_weird_scenes_inside_the/,2,https://redd.it/bm5zjn,epweirdcalm,Opioid Withdrawals: ‚ÄòWeird Scenes Inside the Goldmine‚Äô: Part One ( 1 ) of Two ( 2 ):,"I have fought the consequences of an iatrogenic chemotherapy overdose that cooked my brain, nervous system and smoked my hormones (oncologist never actually stated this but multiple MDs and fellow travelers support the statement) But, after hacking my medical records and physican notes (upward of 10,000 pages), over multiple years). The three ( 3 ) two years were bad. After three ( 3 ) years, I withdrew myself from a 140 mg OxyCodone and OxyContin prescribed dependency

This led to 140mg blended PURE OxyContin and OxyCodone [Do not intended to condescend, but for the less experienced readers, I will clarify: OxyContin is simply the extended relief (ER) ‚ÄòBig Brother‚Äô to OxyCodone, which is immediate release (IR). OxyCodone is also the only ingredient, besides inert fillers in both names  OxyCodone and OxyContin of the ER and IR pills. Percocet, Vicodin and many more are a blend of OxyCodone with acetominaphine (Tylenol). Difference is that in today‚Äôs zeitgeist of ‚Äòopioid-demonization‚Äô, the ER version CAN NOT ANY-LONGER be crushed then insuficated, cooked for injecting or plugged. That is why ‚ÄòOP‚Äô is on the the flip side of the pill.

I reiterate, it can be kicked, but ‚Äòmindset‚Äô is everything. See my post re: withdrawing.

Again, well intending but clueless doctors hooked me again, but on simultaneous Cymbalta, Tramadol, Lexapro and Vicodin. What do the first three ( 3 ) have in common? Serotonin uptake inhibitors that over the course of long-term use, stop releasing Serotonin from the brain. The brain then ( metaphorically speaking) becomes a sponge soaked in Serotonin that leads to major-chemical-induced-depression. 

I entered into a simultaneous state of diagnosed ‚ÄòSerotonin Poisoning‚Äô, because my PC (primary care) MD wrote me 180 Vicodin 10mg. The pain did not go away. I demanded Percocet. PC said,  ‚ÄúNO!‚Äù, because you are drug seeking. He sent me to a psychiatrist‚Äîlegendary for getting people off opioids. He is an ‚ÄòAbsolute No Bullshit‚Äô guy. After arguing with the psychiatrist ( who told me to leave ), I cooperated and walked off the opioid (180 Norco 10mg p/month), in five ( 5 ) days to his amazement. After that, the psychiatrist wrote me Gabapentin (non-narcotic nerve blocker) and ‚ÄòRitalin‚Äô (Dopamine simulator), then, ran blood panels to prove his hypothesis regarding the damage done by oncologist and PCP. Indeed, my dopamine was zero (flat) and my testosterone ( hovering above zero { 0 }, just enough to create a urine stream and a flaccid ‚ÄòJohnson‚Äô. He emulated the hormone dopamine (sense of well being) and met with my primary care physican (PCP) and openly told him I was twice the victim of iatrogenic treatment that created two opioid withdrawals and ‚ÄòSerotonin Poisoning‚Äô. He further admonished the PCP that I (his patient) am not ‚Äòdrug seeking‚Äô, rather ‚Äòrelief seeking‚Äô. 

This psychiatrist / neurologist was again, stern and fierce. He openly criticized the oncologist and PCP for iatrogenic treatment forming multiple dependencies. It took 84 days to titrate me off: Lexapro (14 days), Cymbalta (21 days) and Tramadol (49 days and 3 attempts: Yes, I failed twice coming down from Tramadol 75mg, each time to 5mg. The restless legs, stomach cramping, body-coldness, staring off into space and headaches were relentless. So, the fierce psychiatrist turned out to be a compassionate master. He showed me a way to get off Tramadol. I started cutting the 5mg pills, in smaller and smaller pieces, over three ( 3 ) weeks, until I was licking 1/4 mg dust every two days, from my wet finger-tip. I made it. I was Serotonin free. I was on Gabapentin and by then, Vyvanase 100mg, instead of Ritalin. I was clean, except for two ( 2 ) medically necessary drugs: Gabapentin and an amphetamine.

[ *  Excerpt from: https://universityhealthnews.com/daily/depression/what-is-dopamine-understanding-the-feel-good-hormone/
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard of it,.. euphoria, bliss, motivation, and concentration, yet there‚Äôs more to it than that. Like serotonin, dopamine is a type of brain chemical called a neurotransmitter. Released by neurons (brain cells), neurotransmitters control myriad body functions and transmit signals from the brain to the body by passing across small gaps (called synapses) between each neuron. ]

Dopamine is involved in many pathways in the brain, playing an important role in a range of body systems as well as functions, including movement, sleep, learning, mood, memory, and attention. So, obviously, it‚Äôs a key chemical. Inadequate or imbalanced levels of dopamine can play a part in multiple conditions, including depression (see ‚Äú14 Dopamine Deficiency Symptoms‚Äù sidebar below). Dopamine helps to control the flow of information through the brain, aiding you particularly in terms of working memory, a part of the memory that provides short-term recall.‚Äù ]

bm3siz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bm3siz/acquiring_pain_meds_after_surgery/,34,https://redd.it/bm3siz,PraiseJunkieJesus,Acquiring pain meds after surgery.,"So after I went to treatment and got clean around a year ago I informed my doctors that I had an opiate problem when it came up in my medical history. Fast forward to three months ago I break my collarbone and need surgery.

I handled the pain from the break fairly well, but two weeks into it my new orthopedic specialist recommended surgery as it was healing crooked. I informed him after we set up surgery that I used to have an issue with opiates so I didn't want to get prescribed a lot of anything. 

So I have the surgery and they put a steel plate along with 7 screws in my shoulder and wake up two and a half hours later feeling alright, as I was on a mixture of drugs (IV fentanyl is one I heard them list, but we all know how long that lasts)  from the anesthesiologist. Fast forward to later that night and I'm writhing in pain on my bed. My bed is nearly soaked from the sweat and possibly tears running from my body and I can't eat. 

So the next day I have my girlfriend take me to the local urgent care to try and get a three day script to get through the worst of it. The kind nurse informs me that this doctor won't prescribe opiates right off the bat, and offers me toradol, which I already have a script for! I tell them to not waste their time, the nurse apologizes and recommend I call the hospital I got the surgery at.

I called that hospital and they can't give me an opiate script over the phone, and being that I'm two hours away from the hospital I had surgery at, and in an incredible amount of pain, I don't want to suffer through the drive there and back.

So my last resort before heading to the streets is the local emergency room. I head in there and ask the doctor, showing him my fresh surgery wound, along with my documents showing I indeed just did have surgery. I ask for a three day script explaining I'm an ex addict and just need something for the next couple of days. 

This doctor wrote me a script for lorotab 5s. But lo and behold he wrote a script for 20 of them and gave me a dose at the hospital! Bless his heart, I made those last 3 days and was in the clear!

I have, I have border too, and its difficult, I am on sedatives and anti depressants.

Now my psycsh is tappering off 10mg weekly, its been 2 weeks and I am miserable, I didnt know how bad I would be, but I though nothing like that, pain, so much pain, sweats, colds, vomiting, stomached, no sleep at all, and I am taking clonidine 0.1 some like that 2 times a day, and this shists idk, doing nothing. 

Here they prefer tapper me off to 0, between I taking pharmaceutical and prescript methadone, they prefer I IV morph. No harm reduction at all. I was good on meth, no relapses, but I am thinking of this yet. Some tips? Opinions? Its too fast for a taper right? I am not ready to quit too, but nothing I tell, nothing that I send him works.

I wanna say no more than 3-4 days ago i started noticing symptoms of what could be an infection. 

They would primarily affect me at night, symptoms such as a fever, chills, migraines, fatigue, nausea/queasiness (this is throughout the day and night), body aches and tenderness (pretty much my whole body but its the worst in my hands, arms, neck, and back) , swollen lymph nodes (though it doesn‚Äôt hurt to swallow and my tonsils are normal), my eyes are sensitive to light but it could be in correlation with the migraines. I feel more tired than normal also. 

Im experiencing a whole lot of symptoms and im definitely worried this is something serious. I googled common infections from intravenous drug use, infections like Hep C/B, endocarditis, Sepsis, Cellulitis, Staph Infections, Tetanus, HIV, Botulism, Mononucleosis. And out of all these infections, the only one that seems to relate to my symptoms the most is Mononucleosis. 

Now i am no expert and this could just be a flu, i also thought this was cotton fever the other night because after shooting, I nearly puked and got a fever/chills but i hadnt reused any cotton so i was kind of confused but maybe i don‚Äôt understand how cotton fever works.

So, I've been seeing someone for around 6 months now. We're not in an official relationship because we mutually decided to keep it casual as neither of us is in the right mindset or place in our lives for a relationship. I would probably be happy if it did turn into a relationship because I want to continue seeing this guy in the future but I also find relationships difficult and stressful so I don't mind it being casual just now. Also, it was actually me who said I didn't want a relationship first but he would have told me that anyway and he reinforced the idea that he really isn't ready for that rn. That's fine, neither am I.

That said, even being fwb (hate that phrase) things can be complicated. For example, he is sometimes impossible to contact. I didn't hear anything from him for 2 weeks and had no idea why. Also, I'm preparing to get off heroin and begin recovery. This is an extremely stressful period in my life just now, I'm attending multiple drug screening/Dr's appointments and trying to get on my sub script ASAP which is easier done than said in Scotland, but that's another issue.

On top of this, I'm waiting for my mental health benefits to come through and am absolutely skint rn. My parents found out about my addiction a couple of weeks ago and it completely freaked them out. I'm living with them because of money issues and it's very tense, they basically want me out but I've got no money to move out/no one else I can stay with atm. I always struggle with pretty serious mental health issues including an eating disorder which I'm not getting any support for because, in Scotland, you can only be seen by the mental health side of the NHS when your drug use is stable (so at least 2 or 3 months after you start your maintanence script). My point being that yes, I am feeling very low rn but it doesn't mean I'll feel like that for ever, I'm just struggling atm. I was really hurt when the guy I'm seeing said he hadn't been in touch because I was too depressing and negative to be around, and that, he didn't 'need' that rn. I have always made an effort to be in a good mood when I see him. I'm honest about my life though. Not exactly like he is the most positive person either. Our first conversation he told me he had tried to commit suicide and asked me about my own attempt. He asked, not me. 

Long term, I know he's not the right person for me but we do have a great time when we see each other. Unfortunately only once a week or once every 10 days for supposed reasons I won't get into. I'm also so isolated rn that any social contact makes me feel better. 

I know that the general rule of thumb in early recovery is to avoid situations and relationships like this and, honestly, I think that's good advice. I'm torn between thinking that this won't be good for me and ending it and being scared of being alone all the time again.

But, because of getting arrested and trying to make the best of it I have to quit smoking weed and most other drugs as well. (I'll still trip here and there who are we kidding). 

So the question is how the fuck do I get some goddamn motivation or energy without drugs?? I used mostly weed, opiates and a little benzo but enjoyed the opiate high the most, stims never did much for me but I did enjoy coke(on its own I didn't feel much) best mixed with Opes.

1)  Have you ever been on a pain contract with a Dr? If so, what was your highest daily prescribed dose and how long were you on said contract? (If NO, skip to question 7) 



2)  While on a pain contract, did your Dr increase your dose when you would complain about tolerance? If not, were you forced to seek ""outside"" sources for your pain medication? 



3)  Has your Dr ever decreased your dose or fired you as a patient? How did you manage your withdrawal symptoms? 



4) Did your pain Dr taper you off of your medication before cutting you off ? 



5)  Did your Dr offer to assist in your withdrawal by giving Rx comfort meds ? 



6) Did he/she inform you about acute opiate withdrawal  symptoms: what they are, why they happen, how long they last? Did he/she talk with you about PAWS?




7)  What age did you start using opiates?   




8) What opiate was your first? Was it an Rx from a Dr following an injury or surgery? Did you get them from a friend? Or, was it heroin?



9) If you were unable to get Rx opiates from your Dr to control pain following an injury, would you seek them out using other methods?



10) Have you ever asked a Dr for help with an addiction to opiates and been turned down?



11) Have you ever been turned away from addiction treatment services because of your inability to pay?

Little sleep last night, had to even call out of work because I simply can't function in an office environment, sweating, setting up critical building automation system programming. Restless legs seem ok for now, the agitation and overall low mood/energy are killing me.. no appetitie, stomached about a half gallon of water over the past 24 hours so that has to be a plus. Losing focus on simple tasks wetger it be why I walked in the kitchen, what did I need to do today, I forgot to add that I stopped smoking cigs about 7 months ago and that was a fucking cake walk in comparison lol so those sounds mighty delish but I won't go there.. 

Met a really good, genuine guy on Reddit yesterday and he's been really pushing me to keep this going. We exchanged some contact info and immediatly upon waking up I had a message telling me it's just another day, how you feeling, and stay strong.

I have taken about 4g kratom, and about 1mg Xanax before bed last night which I don't think helped much.

Methadone can and does save many lives.

It‚Äôs possible I may catch some flack for this, from people still enjoying their heroin addiction.

But, as a commenter on vid. pointed out and reminded me...even active heroin addicts (as opposed to just NA folk) push the stigma about methadone. Tho. the NA minded often just try to slander m.done by calling patients ‚Äújunkies‚Äù. (The disdain in word is theirs, not mine.)

Without doubt..people in active addiction head to internet to read about things like this, and pushing the outdated religion-based guilt trip ...if it keeps someone from getting on the program...could kill someone.

So, I‚Äôm not here telling anyone to get on methadone as their first course of action. In fact, you should try cold turkey, Kratom, or other methods first.

At the same time, I in the past.. I was someone who waited nearly a decade to get on methadone and .., without even having met a methadone patient in my life (!!) Would try to talk people out of getting on o.r.t. because of the dangerous stigma pushed and too often accepted without question.

I've heard of ppl heating up the pills like dope and even sucking thru a cotton from a spoon like dope. (Overall the best way would be to use a micro-filter, but if u don't have one on hand or can't access one. I believe my method is better than adding a cotton to the solution like you do with dope...)

First crush pill and let fully dissolve in water...(make sure the thing you use to dissolve in is easy to pour out of... I suggest a medicine measurement cup like on the top of a Nyquil bottle...)

Second, get a child medicine syringe, the plastic ones with no needle. And stuff the bottom with cotton, not the thick cuz it's possible some good stuff can get stuck...

Third carefully pour the dissolved solution into the child syringe and make sure u have something to catch the liquid in... I recommend another clean medicine measurement cup...

Lastly, use the plunger to squeeze the solution thru the cotton in the child syringe... Then use your rig to suck up the clean solution... 

Every time I do this way it comes out completely clear with no white or any color. Seems to be the best way. 
I've tested the way where u dissolve in spoon then add cotton and for me it always came out a bit white, like some pill fillers got thru..

My doctor had me sign a patient agreement which stated they may randomly test me for narcotics. That this was a prescribing agreement in order to become a patient and that they may withhold any medications they prescribe depending on any positive drug tests. I was not on any narcotics when becoming a patient of the practice.

I believe this violates civil rights and is a discriminatory practice. If it is used for all patients, I would question whether any other patient who came positive for a narcotic down the road would be abruptly terminated & denied life long maintenance medication which is not a pain medication, opiate or narcotic. 

When calling in May 5th 2019 for my refill of medication I've been on for 15 years, I was told that my urine test  last time came back positive for benzodiazepine and the Physician Assistant (the only practioner I've seen although my primary care is listed as the doctor in the practice) would not prescribe me my regular medication for a minimum of 3 months.

This does not go with the standard of care, especially with a medication I should only be titrated slowly off of due to the dose which has been standardized for over 10 years. Additionally, I believe this is medical negligence and amounts to patient abandonment without a justifiable excuse. I see no medical nexus between testing positive for a substance not currently prescribed and refusing to refill a regular medically deemed necessary prescription. 

There is a duty to care for current patients, not punish them. I can understand if these tests were given to ensure medical compliance (being sure a patient takes their narcotic and doesn't sell them for example), or if a discussion around substance abuse needed to take place (in that case I question again if every patient from 90-12 is routinely drug screened when not on a narcotic). However, I see this as both a discriminatory practice as well as a serious breach of medical duty.

I hope the fellow curious minds among you will find that interest overshadows irrelevance.

My only excuse for taking out my restless, weed-induced ramblings on you, my Internet friends, is that I usually subject the guy I'm dating to them. But, as of late, he's busy all the goddamn time. Although that's not exactly new, but that's something I'm not going into rn because it wd submerge pages.
 
Right, I'll get to it... 

When I bought my tobacco today, the woman serving me, asked for my ID and then chuckled to herself when she looked at it. She muttured something about me looking too young. This got me thinking of all the other times I've bought ciggies or tobacco and the person serving me has made a comment about my age or appearance. It happens regularly. One Asian man told me I had 'too much of a baby face'. A lot of people outrightly ask where I come from. I get asked where I come from all the time, not only when shopping. 

I really don't fit with the drug/heroin scene here at all. I look generically foreign and all the users and dealers I've met are white and grew up in this city. I grew up here too in an area with a lot of drug abuse (kind of like the hood in the US, I guess) so once they hear my speak, they stop questioning me about my heritage sooner. 

Although my dealer went on about it for ages. Saying I looked Greek or Arabic or whatever. And they mention how young I look frequently. 

My questions to you are do you fit with the drug scene where you are? Are you living abroad? Is the scene diverse? Also on age, are you younger/older than most other users/dealers you know or see? If you're younger, do people mention it? Are you made aware of it? 

There's a lot of judgement from non-users about the demographic of those addicted to drugs. I never worry about being caught or searched for anything (maybe naively idk) because I look like the very last person to be an addict or involved with drugs. Where I live, the stereotype for users is white, city-born, lower than working class. People who live in schemes and are on benefits, probably fairly under-educated. 

My parents were working class so although I had a rough childhood, I was well educated and went to college. I'm now a qualified teacher. Yes, a junky teacher. Not good I know, but I'm getting on subs soon, thank god.",1557179953.0

Long time lurker on the subreddit, barely ever posted or commented. Started dabbling in opiates at around 15/16 when I broke my wrist and got a script for T3's. Moved onto grandma's hydrocodone and oxycodone. Have always chipped, usually do a few doses and then not use again for two or three months.  


Even though I've only chipped for a long time, I can't deny that opiates are my favorite drug. So I thought hmm, maybe I can exploit the 42 degree curve in my spine from my congenital scoliosis to get me some goodies! Went to a PM doc and they drug tested me on the first visit. Failed for THC, and they refused to prescribe me anything. Went to another guy that seemed like he's low-key running a pill mill, and got 5mg Oxycodone HCl on the first visit.  


Yay, I did it! Or so I thought. I didn't expect to have to go to FIVE different pharmacies to find one that would actually fill the prescription, because they are all ""out of stock"" since people ""rarely get prescribed pure oxycodone"". That's what they all told me, but I eventually got the script filled.  


That was all in the month of April. Fast forward to this month, and awesome, the doc bumps me up to 10mg Oxycodone HCl because like I said, dude is low-key running a pill mill. Yay! However, the appointment was on Friday, and somehow today is Monday and I still don't have my 60 pills.  


I've gone to 9. Yes, 9. N I N E different pharmacies, and they've all given me the same ""out of stock"" bullshit. I went to 7 different CVS's before posting on here and asking for advice a couple days ago. People told me to go to Mom n Pop private pharmacies. I tried two today, and was still met with the same excuses. They even suggested me to go to CVS's lol. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I don't know if it's because I'm 21 and they are thinking ""you're too young to be taking this medication"".  


All in all im fucking annoyed. Im tired of the excuses, and im tired of the ""you dirty drug addict"" looks that the pharmacists give me when I hand them that piece of paper. Yes, I use my medication to get high. Yes, I also use my medication correctly when I have pain. I'm fine for now, but this has me thinking, what about the legitimately fucked pain patients who actually need these pills around the clock? These pharmacies are fucking assholes, and they seem to think that they're doing god's great work by not handing out opioids period.

I've left the country twice in the throes of my addiction for 1 and 3 weeks respectively. Both times, I got through the airport without consequence. Both times, I put my dope in a condom, and then into my snatch. 

&#x200B;

Getting through the airport with dope should be the easiest thing about leaving the country. For me, the challenge comes when trying to use abroad.

&#x200B;

Since I only smoke my dope, I've never had to worry about bringing rigs along, and if that were the case I would just do my research and pick up at the point of destination. 

&#x200B;

Before getting on the plane, I buy an opaque bottle of eye drops and I convert some of my boy to monkey water. By getting a new bottle, the TSA has nothing to see except for bright squeeky eye drops in my carry on rather some dirty thing coated with tar . . . Tbh I hate monkey water with a passion. I've gotten high a grand total of ONE TIME with it, but the stuff is a lifesaver when the sickness hits. If I didn't have monkey water for a 16 hour plane ride, I 100% would have shit my pants.

&#x200B;

Be safe when you use aboard. Do your research, and know what to expect if you were to get caught. However you use, be discreet. In a country where drug use is punishable by death, I used monkey water almost exclusively and smoked only one time when I knew there was zero chance of getting caught, and it felt AMAZING after all that monkey. 

&#x200B;

Most importantly, when you travel, embrace the experience. I never got high when I was out there which was frustrating at the time, but I also never got sick. While there definitely were times when I felt a little more lost and distressed in the Land Without Nodz than I should have, I was able to stay fully engrossed by my surroundings and experience. Don't be a bitch just because your dboy is across the world, and instead take a cue from Anthony Bourdain. Travel to find those missing pieces of yourself, and cherish the world.

So, am a nurse in a small town hospital in US, and like so many other small towns, it has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic. I typically don‚Äôt have patients admitted specifically for opioid withdrawal, but that has recently changed. I feel very comfortable dealing with alcohol withdrawal- (as in I know what to expect and there is a set medical protocol that tells me when and what medication to administer).  Heroin withdrawal... I am totally in the dark and feel like the typical hospitalist in charge of medical management of patient is as well. Please help! Questions:
(1) In terms of grams, how much Heroin does a daily user consume? What amount indicates a very high tolerance?
(2) What are your withdrawal symptoms. Please be very specific. I know the basics that I can objectively measure like heart rate, etc. I want to know about the other stuff... how your body feels.
(3) Does withdrawal make you sleepy and lethargic, anxious and agitated, or both?
(4) What can I say as a nurse to encourage you, help you, etc. I am already very non judgmental and a big believer that we all have problems, some are just more or less deadly, or more or less socially acceptable.
(5) If you have been through withdrawal that was medically managed, what medication did they use, and what route (IV, oral).  
(6) If you are sober, how did you achieve sobriety?

Thanks from the bottom of my heart. All I could do was hold my patient‚Äôs hand and tell them they could do this. That the past was the past,  every day is a new day.

Fuck Adderall I thought!  I wanna be relaxed! Fuck school!  The next 3 years I struggled with a 1-8 Xanax a day habit that wound me up in juvie at 15 because my parents called the cops on me for being too fucked up at the house.  Fast forward to my first year of college. I had been acquainted with the taste of opiates before.  I had never had a reliable source though.  Well this changed my first year of college.

I had been messing around with oxy 30's in high school, but that addiction paled in comparison to my Benzo addiction in high school.  When I got to college august of last year, I began falling deep into a dark opiate hole.  I was taking 4 30's a day combined with weed, and Xanax.  Eventually I got too fucked up and went to my parents house and broke a window to get inside to get one of my ar15s because I was broke and wanted to sell it.  the police came and arrested me.

Really looking for some advice on where I should go from here... (I apologize in advanced for the long post!!)

Long story short, I was on opiate pain medication for a few chronic pain issues/illness. 10mg percocet up to 4 times a day. I ended up getting pregnant and my drs decided it would be better for the duration of the pregnancy if I was switched to Subutex instead... didn't make much sense to me, but I was so terrified of having a child with any complications, they convinced me it would be safer/easier on the baby to be on buprenorphine. I was told coming off medication entirely was not an option and that if the withdrawal from my medication didn't kill the baby, then the stress my body was under from my day to day pain could potentially cause me to miscarry as well... I was switched and prescribed up to 20mg/daily, in the form of 8mg tablets... thinking back on it now, the dose was so unnecessarily high, I'm glad that I went with my gut and started off with a very low dose to see how it affected me. I didn't take a consistent dose every day as I was supposed to be on it as ""pain management""- I split dose smaller amounts throughout the day instead of taking one or two full doses a day. I averaged 4 to 8mg/day at one point 12 to 16mg/day when I was very uncomfortable, but back down to 4-8mg/day by the time I delivered. Thankfully baby had zero complications/side effects/withdrawal!!

Long story short, I had a very horrible and traumatic labor experience and an equally awful extended stay afterwards. My tolerance was obviously affected by the Subutex and instead of taking my usual percocet doses, I ended up being prescribed the buprenorphine AND a higher dose of 20mg oxycodone up to 4 times a day. I don't know why but it's like as soon as I had my child, my entire medical team and my drs flipped a switch. I expressed concerns about being on so much medication, about wanting to get off of all narcotics so I could safely breastfeed, argued about wanting to only be on one or the other while I was healing from my csection. They really wanted to push these narcotics on me!! Ended up stopping the buprenorphine altogether once discharged and was just taking my oxycodone, which pissed my dr off for ""not following medical advice""... sparing everyone any extra details, I ended up dropping myself from both of the drs practices that I was attending before and throughout my pregnancy.

With that being said... no more scripts for me!! I'm honestly not that upset about it, I would rather be able to relactate and breastfeed my child while he is still young and worry about the possibility of pain management down the line... but obviously I'm facing withdrawal now. So I'm hoping to get some advice on what would be the least painful way for me to go about it... 

I still have a couple of Subutex pills leftover but as of tomorrow I'll be out of my oxycodone. Should I go cold turkey? Split up the last 4 oxycodone pills to spread over the next couple of days and then jump? Or should I try and taper and jump with just the Subutex? I read online that people have taken suboxone for 2 or 3 days to get off of different types of opiates. It's been quite a while since I've taken the buprenorphine, so it's not in my system at all. Either way, it'll have to be a quick taper, as I only have 3 of those tablets left. I know this won't be painless but I have a new baby I need to be able to care for while hubby is at work, so I'm looking for advice on how to go about doing this!!!!

I went to see the Avengers End Game opening day with my dealer lol. My grandma has been in the ICU and has a 50 percent chance of making it so I used that as justification to self medicate.

Anyhow before I even went to the theatre I took 4mg of Xanax, which is why I most likely did the fent. I start craving opiates, weed and alcohol when I take a nice dose of xan. So homeboy hooked me up with a 20 sack of fent.

Toward the end of the movie (I don‚Äôt remember shit) I guess I got up and went to the restroom and smoked the whole 20 sack and that‚Äôs where I guess I overdosed. Collapsed. I have a massive bruise on my bicep from some guy that pulled me out from under the damn stall. I woke up on the bathroom floor with a bunch of little kids all freaked out and the paramedics said, you overdosed we just narcanned you. It only took one narcan shot. 

Crazy thing is, I‚Äôve taken about 16 more mg of Xanax and smoked, snorted and slammed fentanyl all day, and besides talking to myself, I was good!

Anyhow, I arrive at the hospital and I just wanna leave. The doctor pleads with me to stay there because she says when the narcan wears off in 5 hours, I could fall out again. I didn‚Äôt listen, I left and picked up another dime, went home and smoked that and was fine... 

That‚Äôs the first time I ever got narcanned. It was way more of a pleasant experience than being put on ice and slapped in the face by my south side Mexicans cousins.

My daily dose has been 100 mme per day for a couple of years.  I do abuse my meds, but have been responsible enough to not call in for a refill early. I also make sure that If i have to go for a visit in that it's at least 32 days from my last fill, so if my pee test is negative it can be explained (usually get tested once a year and I dont use anything besides opiates and prescribed xanax).

Recently I brought up that, while the meds still help a lot, they just dont help with the pain the way they used to. I was told I am at the maximum mme dose and that if I needed anything stronger or more that I would need to go to pain management. Doc said they ""aren't allowed to prescribe over 100mme daily"". I know this is totally a bs response due to increased pressure from dea/FDA to stop using opiates to treat patients with chronic pain and the bs stigma, but that's a whole other rant. 

My question is what's it like for those in Pain Management? Is it the next logical step that's worth it or should I just be happy with what I get and not rock the boat. I do need my meds, but I dont thing there is any amount that I could be prescribed that would keep me from running out in a week or two.

 I currently do all my meds in about 7-10 days, so regular tests or pill counts definitely wouldn't be a good thing. I'm definitely not the standard patient with chronic pain. I bust my ass to stay in good shape and manage to fight through pain on a daily basis. However the healthy physique and looking like I'm in my early 20 certainly doesn't help my cause. I'm asked about 3-4 times a year what I'm prescribed pain medication for and that I shouldn't be taking it. Usually by pharmacists or other doctors (treating me for a completely unrelated condition like a skin rash). Physical appearance is really important to me and if you dont look handicapped that I guess you aren't in pain. Again I digress.

I'm administering chest compressions and sternum rubs as she, his gf, is on speaker with an EMS officer.  Following orders from her based on what he was doing.  Sometimes rolling him onto his side.

I didn't have any narcan, at the time it was very hard to get narcan, this was back in 2015.  I got him breathing, but it was very labored and irregular and he was still unconscious. I continue checking his pulse just waiting for EMS.

EMS get there, they administer narcan and I zoop out of there.

He then had the audacity to accuse me of fucking his girl like 2 weeks later lol.  After saving his life, well I didn't really safe his life, maybe just prevented less brain damage potentially.

If your state has Good Samaritan law please please call the police if someone who is with you is ODing and don't call a friend, unless that friend has narcan and is within a 5 minute radius!

It's just not worth it.  I'd rather cop a dope charge than have a homie die....

How should I proceed to taper them to minimize the withdrawal symptoms? And how long after the last dose do symptoms start appearing and how long do they usually last?

I have been using heroin (#3, afghan brown powder) on-and-off again for the past 6 months. Usually I was smoking it off the foil or sniffing, but in the past two weeks I have begun doing it IV, which I do not like. I would like to stop, since I saw that chipping doesn't work and even if I was always convinced that I would never begin IVing (I didn't even like it so much when I first tried it, which helped me with convincing myself that I won't do it), I am now there. I want to stop before I sink too deep.

Do you think I can do it with 7 pills?

For long-term management I plan to go into therapy, but first I want to stop using.

Any help or advice is welcome. Please help me do it, reddit.

At first the percs helped with my intense insomnia. I will go three nights without sleep, on the natch. I‚Äôve had a sleep study where they determined I have minimal apnea. Only that info never made it to me. I assumed, wrongly, that the study yielded nothing. In 2018 I had two surgeries where they loaded me up for months, with norco and oxy. No problem sleeping then. 

I wrote my PCP through their portal and asked for something to break these cycles of non existent sleep. She RX 30 #50 of trazadone. I‚Äôm already on Zoloft and the trazadone doesn‚Äôt do shit. I have an appointment with a pulmonologist in June but I need something now. Tomorrow I write her a second time and ask for Lunesta, which I‚Äôve taken before and through her office. Why she didn‚Äôt recall that, I don‚Äôt understand. However, both Ambien and Lunesta don‚Äôt work for me long term. I had terrible nightmares on Lunesta, the type where something awful was happening to my grandson. And the Ambien, forget it for some women like me. Unbeknownst to me, until Amazon and eBay packages showed up with stuff I didn‚Äôt remember purchasing. Shit went sideways for a while. I even opened an eBay packing with a used Rolex. Hell, I can‚Äôt afford that and was fortunate to be able to resell it quickly. But that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt take Ambien. I read that people will get up in the middle of the night and shop or drive places. I‚Äôd be willing to do the Lunesta again, short term until I see the specialist. 

Do any of you good people have any remedies for this? I have a ton of kratom from a good vendor and it‚Äôs the dark red kind. I tried it a few nights ago by taking a tablespoon in hot water and it knocked me out. Tried that amount the next evening and nothing. I know that a tablespoon is equal to about 14 grams so maybe I took too much. Is less better?

&#x200B;

also what is the difference between hydro, oxy, codeine vs like hydromorphone or oxymorphone and even heroin? they are all just different opiates right? so the high is the same from all these just in different intensities? Also would i get withdrawals from taking 5mg of hydro a few times a day for like a week? I have little tolerance and an inhumane metabolism at 5'11 120lbs. I have never missed a day of shitting, i assume that has some reason as to why i get really high off just 5mg..

I've been trying to taper off fast-ish. I was full of piss and vinegar and wanted off.

It sucks balls. 18 to 8 in 10 days was barely phasing me, I thought I had this on lock. 4 days dropped to 6mg and hit me like a brick.

I decided to try to force the next one by skipping weekend, while covering with some hydrocodone, then 4mg mon to Fri. It blew. Just total anxiety, spun head, mild nausea only, but awake at 2am every fucking night.

I've backed off. I am thinking either, 1mg every 10 days. Starting between 6 and 8 even.

Does that sound sensible? I just can't stand being sick for 3 weeks, even if it's not the worst. It's the non-fucking stop of the fast taper.

Is switching to methadone any easier for the taper, because you can make smaller adjustments more often? Or should I stick to subs.

There are only two ways to count them, how many days you've been there, and how many you have left.


It was day two for me, and after being rudely awakened by a nurse at the ungodly hour of 7 I knew what lay ahead. Breakfast, medications, and my first meeting with my still unknown psychiatrist.


Breakfast was instant eggs, pancakes, cereal, toast, and grits. Mira was nowhere in sight so I took my tray to the least crazy looking table of people and sat down.


Holding fast to my west coast identity I traded my grits for fruit with a surely man seated across from me. He poked at his breakfast, itching his arms, constantly watching the clock, another junkie for sure. 


‚ÄúI'm J‚Äù I said introducing myself with a handshake.


‚ÄúEmmet‚Äù he replied bluntly through a bite of egg.


‚ÄúSo heroin or suicide?‚Äù I probed, as everyone's attention turned to me for asking such a blatant question.


‚ÄúHeroin, you?‚Äù He replied monotone.


‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù 


‚ÄúLife's hard man. The sooner you learn that the better.‚Äù he said.


‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled going back to my eggs.



Back in the common room we watched shitty morning TV, waiting for medications, until a new voice called my name.


‚ÄúSmith?‚Äù asked a short Indian woman in a lab coat. 


‚ÄúYeah‚Äù I said turning around in my chair.


‚ÄúWould you come with me please?‚Äù she said through a thick accent.


‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered getting up and following her to an office room down a corridor. 


Sitting in one of those ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù chairs I ¬†began my first meeting with Dr. Chandri. 


‚ÄúWell you're on quite the list of medications‚Äù she mused.


‚ÄúKlonopin, Vicodin, Seroquel, Naproxen, Lexapro...‚Äù she read aloud, going through my list.


‚ÄúSo what brought you here? It says here a suicide attempt? Tell me about that.‚Äù She said, putting my file down and looking me in the eye.


‚ÄúI was tired of being in pain all the time. I made a partial attempt half a week ago, but I stopped, cause I was asked to be a best man.‚Äù


‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶ and what kind of pain are you in?‚Äù 


‚ÄúConstant physical pain, I can't control half of my body's movements. It's like being shocked with jumper cables, just torture.‚Äù I replied, wincing as my body jerked again.


‚ÄúWell there's a medication I'd like to start you on called Suboxone it should help with the pain and if like to up your Lexapro to help the depression. We'll start you on them tonight.‚Äù She said matter of factly, shutting my file and gesturing toward the door. 


‚ÄúSuboxone are you fucking kidding me? I can't get high on that shit! At least I get to keep my Klonopin script.‚Äù I thought to myself, but it was clear she had labeled me as a junkie. 


Sometimes the only way out is through. So like an idiot I agreed with a quick ‚ÄúOK, thank you for your time‚Äù as I walked back to the common room. 


I missed morning medications during my brief meeting with my new psychiatrist, so I headed up to the counter to ask for my morning fix.


A large black woman who reminded me of Medea sat near the counter. After noticing me she turned and said ‚ÄúYou need your meds hunn?‚Äù


‚ÄúYes mamm‚Äù I replied solemnly. Knowing there would be no Vicodin to bless my aching bones this morning.


After swallowing my now disappointing cup of meds I went back to try and find Mira. I wanted to bitch about my cynical psychiatrist but it was already class time. Instead I made my way to my room to wallow in withdrawal. 


‚ÄúSon of a bitch‚Äù I muttered tossing and turning trying to sleep, but it would not come. My life now was pain, restlessness, and pure torture nothing would change that. The hooks of dependency tore at my flesh exposing the creature inside. Bound in chains of hot iron and freezing ice it screamed for just one last fix but no salvation was coming.


‚ÄúMaybe tonight I will get some relief‚Äù I mused but I didn't dare set any expectations.",1557019671.0

So here goes....

I have  struggled on  and off with opiates/addiction for about 8 years. Previous ""heroin  phases"" for me have lasted months and, at most, up to about a year of  heavy daily use. I've successfully gotten clean in the past; however,  this time, with this certain, peculiar ""dope"" has proven to be  absolutely so much more insanely painful and difficult to w/d from than  EVER before - and I had previously gotten through the sickness,  following a 10 month phase of literally the purest, strongest raw i'd  ever discovered, simply with 5-7 days of methadone...... so, i need your  help gang.

So,  for the last  year now,  i've been exposed to the ""caps"", which are  clear little gelatin capsules of ""scramble"" known as ""Man-Down"", ""Black  Panther"", ""A-1"", ""T-O"", ""Black Magic"" - what have you out in the  projects. So, after getting familiar with these caps, and many of them,  increasingly, daily for about a year now; about 4 months ago, I tried to  quit by going on a  methadone program, which, as said above, has very  successfully helped me to clean myself of real dope in the past. My  urine returned some funny results....

After  my  intake, the drug test came up positive for: methadone,  suboxone,  barbituates, benzos, and ""other opiates"", which I was told at  the  clinic is usually the results they see here - with ""other  opiates""  being stuff like fent, carfent,  and any of the other 24+ analogues now  floating around in the mix these days. I was perplexed as to why, only  playing with these newly familiar caps, and some xanax here and there,  why there's methadone and  suboxone, barbs, and the ""other"" in my  system, which I had always assumed was fentanyl - but at this point,  after doing some research, I'm prettyyy sure that it's a much stronger  fentalogue that is far worse, especially considering that one day when  trying to get clean from this stuff, I felt totally fine for the first  like 18 hours absent with just a little bit of methadone  and like 1mg  of xanax..... I guess that's just 'scramble'. But, my understanding was  that Fent has a super short half life and from previous w/d experiences,  before these caps, I would start getting sick off of presumably classic  fent-laced stuff in like 5-6 hours after dosing.... SO, I'm super  perplexed as to why my w/d with these things can get so bad after quite a  bit of absence and then go on for so long after....

So,  I tried to break up with the scram kaps ..... **WORST WITHDRAWL I HAVE EVER  EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.** Even with 50-100mg of methadone, heavy-duty prescription (like 800mg) tylenol, muscle relaxers,  ***nothing***  made  this crazy sickness much better. it went on for like almost a  week before  I, of course, and unfortunately, gave back in and decided  to just keep getting curing with caps.

For a while now, really my whole life, all I've wanted is to be **done**.  And it's time that I do it for real. I've accumulated a decent arsenal  for beating the sickness,  consisting of: some morphine 30s, some percs,  tons of Kratom, Iodium,  clonodine, xanax, high strength tylenol,  muscle relaxers, suboxone,  about 500mg of methadone (saved up from the  clinic), even just ordered some herbal stuff like: Gaba, Kava, 5Htp,  l-theanine, etc. just the herbal w/d stuff that pops up when you search  for it on Amazon lol but haven't tried em yet, and whatever else you  name it. Plus, of course, I have access to whatever else I might need -  maybe you all could make some recommendations for me? idk.  I  truly,  truly, truly, deeply, so badly want to beat it, more than anything.

So,  I guess, I'm here asking for your advice, your suggestions, your tips  and techniques, any experience  getting off of fent/fent analogues,  subs, whatever else is cocktailed in/any sort of similar types of ""dope""  that you've maybe dealt with before.  (would be great if anyone on here  happens to be familiar, in any way or form, with any of this sort of  new age, nasty, awful fucking shit.) I've been suggested and looked into  Tianeptine and Phenibut and was curious if any of you have experience  using those for w/d on similar types of insanely strong/long lasting  fentalogue sickness???

Another  side note, I thought recently that maybe I could experiment with some  straight up raw to ween off of this stuff, as I've read some people on  here have had  success with in the past. I discovered some pretttyyyyy  nice stuff;  however, I could taste like basically the whole g and still  feel sick without the caps. This is so fucked up, seriously.

So,  yeah, I don't  know who else to turn to for this because it's such a  weird, specific,  today's day in age issue that most traditional W/D  methods don't even apply to this situation, considering the insane  strength, power, time length of half-life, and hold that these new   synthetic opiate analogues can have over us. Any sort of advice or any  tips, recommendations, or ideas, etc. of what has helped or worked for  others in a similar or even somewhat similar situation, in any way  possible, would be life-saving, seriously.

The first thing I noticed is that my my eyes tend to ""glitch out"" pretty often, while staring at a computer screen or smartphone. 

The second thing is: I find it extremely difficult to swallow on heroin, it feels the same way as when it becomes difficult to after doing it several times in a row. It always takes me a few tries until I am able to swallow once. This might be due to some Amphetamine I had taken earlier that day. 

Another thing I have a question about you guys might be able to answer is: 
Yesterday, after smoking quite a bit of heroin (no tolerance) and about 60mg of Amphetamine, I was waiting for the bus to town with a friend of mine when I noticed that the floor, the pavement's texture was moving in strange ways. Kind of like LSD visuals. I thought it could have been a strange light thing so I asked my friend about it who said he wasn't experiencing any visuals. Do you have any idea what could have caused this hallucination?

I swallowed it in pill form, and it was directly from a pharmacy on a prescription. I was also drinking lots of water through this experience. also yes i am probably stupid. apologies for any mistakes, i‚Äôm still in some pain laying on my floor and am also on mobile.

I took 15mg at around 9:20 and sat down doing something. I stood up an hour later and felt airy and cool and shit like that. Then I started feeling tingly and electric and excitedly sexual, like when someone arouses you. It wasn‚Äôt impressive then. I thought it would get more intense since it was just the first hour, so I wasn‚Äôt bothered. I felt a little nauseated and had a mild headache and my psychotic symptoms were a little more intense than usual.

Thirty minutes to an hour passes and I notice I‚Äôm not high anymore. Then I get more nauseated and the headache becomes horrible, I am twitching occasionally, and I‚Äôm super tired. I can‚Äôt really focus on or process anything but I‚Äôm still mentally ‚Äòthere‚Äô.
You know how people use deliriants and go full delirium, or hit dissociative holes, or blackout, or otherwise just detach from reality entirely in a world-spinning trip? I wasn‚Äôt anxious or depressed at all but I felt like that was about to happen. I sort of wanted it to. Not legitimately, but irrationally, I expected to go full breakdown and lose myself even though emotionally I was just fine. I was like this for four hours.

I stood up and my headache and sickness went away and I started eating everything in sight and the physical problems disappeared. I was motivated and not tired. This lasted around an hour. Then I was sick, the headache was back, I was feeling lightheaded, my insides seemed to be tingling and I felt like I was having a panic attack even though I was not consciously anxious. Like a really deep panic. 

I just now (3:30) sat down and ended up throwing up. I don‚Äôt feel nauseated or anxious anymore, at least right now. that ass of a headache is still here though, i feel like i was hit in the head with a hammer but otherwise i‚Äôm fine.

any kind of reply would be appreciated, part of me just wanted to talk about it. i don‚Äôt quite know if i i did anything wrong because although i researched this drug before i took it, i am still very new to it and probably managed to miss some basic 101 ‚Äúhow not to feel like hot garbage on hydrocodone‚Äù piece of advice, or if maybe my body just doesn‚Äôt play well with it. I don‚Äôt think I should have taken it on an empty stomach, or maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have taken 15mg, but it still feels weird that it was that bad and that the high was that short. just wondering what anyone else thinks",1556999351.0

Dabbing 101

When it comes to dabbing a lot of it is really preference. You can literally use whatever different types of dab devices you want to dab tar. I‚Äôve been dabbing for 3 years now, and I‚Äôve literally experimented with every kind of dab tool/device there is and in this little guide I‚Äôm just telling you what I think works the most efficiently with tar without wasting your sack, because I‚Äôve wasted tons of dope when I first started dabbing, and even now when I get a new nail or rig I tend to do it. 

You can use any kind of dab rig, nectar collector, e-nail whatever the fuck you want doesn‚Äôt matter. 

The nail is the important factor here. 

TITANIUM is the way to go. They‚Äôre more expensive but it‚Äôs the best way to dab it. 

Ceramic nails are pointless and your dope will just melt in the nail and it‚Äôll be stuck there forever. Although, I‚Äôve used a ceramic tip in a nectar collector and it worked very well but they break easily and don‚Äôt last long at all because they can‚Äôt handle the heat. 

Quartz nails do work.  I hate using quartz because it can be harsher at times, it has a funny taste, and you end up wasting a lot of dope. One of our dealers dabs too and he literally has over a hundred different dab rigs I‚Äôm not even kidding. He likes to use quartz just because that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs used to but he also wastes so much dope it‚Äôs ridiculous. So unless you have the dope to spare go for titanium. 

Now I‚Äôve learned the hard way when it comes to purchasing nails that there‚Äôs different grades to them. At least with titanium there is. I guess that there‚Äôs different grades to titanium that‚Äôs used in the nails and it makes a huge difference. There‚Äôs only two smoke shops in my area that carry the higher quality grade nails and all the rest carry the shitty ones. The difference is that the lower grade nails don‚Äôt last nearly as long. They can be very harsh! And you can see the cuts of shitty material in the nail if you look at it an angle. If you go to purchase one ask them at the smoke shop if they carry titanium T2 medical grade nails. They might not even know what you‚Äôre talking about but they might. Do yourself a favor and do some research and educate yourself a lil bit. Titanium nails aren‚Äôt cheap so you want them to last and the shitty ones don‚Äôt last long at all. 

Season your nails! Whenever you purchase a new nail you want to season it. All you have to do is get a jug of water and have your torch and butane ready. Get some pliers or something stable to hold the nail and you want to torch it red red red orange for like idk 2 minutes then pour the water on it and cool it down. Then repeat. Do that for about 5-6 times and you should be good to go. You‚Äôre just breaking the nail in. 

I think I‚Äôve covered everything but if I remember something I‚Äôll add to this later. 

One last tip. This is the most controversial debate I have with everyone on here. Should you put water in your dabber? That‚Äôs up to you. I always have water in mine. It makes it smoother and when I‚Äôm dopesick and can‚Äôt get anything the dab water is a life saver. You make a little cup/bowl with foil dump the dab water in it and heat it up with your torch and cook it down. When it‚Äôs cooked down you‚Äôll be able to smoke what‚Äôs left and you‚Äôll get well. The darker the water the better.

She threw me out at home and I got ready for the party. She then collects me again at home and we go to her place where we were partying. At this point I already snorted about 1g of dope and was nodding from that and also popped 12mg of kpins, plus 400mg of DXM to potentate it all. Which works emout eery time.

I already drunk about half a bottle of Johnny Walker and 8-9 German strong beers with 12% alcohol/ 1/2 a litre. Anyways anotger guy on the party offered me some weed and I didnt smoke for month. So I smoke half a blunt with 80/20 mix of weed and tobacco. So fast forward half a hour, I was super fucked uo and decided to go home. And I need to say that I just started using again, I relapsed, and was high as a kite. The alcohol, the dope, the weed got its full grip on me. I was nodding hard like I ever do when I mix in weed to my drug Cocktail. So I was on 1g of dope, 400mg DXM, 200mg DPH and 10mg kpins and the good ole booze I drank like water.

This story doesn‚Äôt have a happy ending, it doesn‚Äôt even have an ending for now. How was it for you, that very first moment you tried an opiate? Did you knew what you were getting into? Or just curiosity took over you?  

A little backstory here, when I used to be in med school I was not a bad student, but did have depression issues which started even from before, when I was a teenager, I never got any kind of professional help or treatment and sort of waited for it to get better, I started smoking a lot of weed, it was the only thing that could calm my anxiety a little.

One day by some random chance a pack of tramadol landed in my hands, at the time I had some kind of cyst on my skin that have been there for a while so I wanted to remove it by myself (it eventually disappeared) I took one of those pills to see if it could take care of the pain while I took care of the cyst, it turned out it felt really great, I forgot about the cyst, and just loved the feeling of bliss, everything was perfect, I had no pain, nor emotional nor physical it was something close to pure happiness, I just started taking more and more pills, I knew the risks, all the side effects the probability of getting addicted, but it did not matter to me, I just loved the feeling, once I took them every day in high doses for about 2 weeks, next morning I woke up feeling really sick, all of my body hurt regardless of how I sat, I had nausea and a terrible diarrhea, I knew the only thing that could make feel better would be some more pills, it took a great deal of will power to not cave in, thankfully the withdrawal did not last long and I survived that time.

I stayed clean for a few months, then I started taking it for a few days in short doses so I would not get a withdrawal, eventually I finished med school and started working in a hospital as an intern (that is basically a doctor that has to be on call over 30 hours every 3 days and gets paid very little or in my case nothing, so I was a something close to a slave) The pressure and stress was overwhelming and I was falling deep into depression, almost getting kicked out for insubordination a few times.  

With time I tried more powerful stuff codeine, and oxicodone (I really liked this one) however I always made sure to take as little as possible, I did not wanted to have withdrawal again, everything ends and so my supply of pills did, I was nearing a breakdown, one day at work I was just locked, could not do anything and got a disciplinary notice for that, I just felt so low and without purpose, I hid myself in a bathroom and laid in the floor crying for a few minutes, I just wanted all of the pain to end, go home and kill myself somehow. Fortunately I got a kitten the next day, it was from my ex-gf she could not keep it and I took care of her, that sweet cat somehow became a reason to keep living, however this was just temporary, this was in November 2018.

January of 2019 came and I had this particularly terrible shift on new years eve, I had to come in the 31st of December and got out on January 1st and since our boss decided to change all of our working teams I needed to be on call again the next day, I was so tired, I got in a little argument with my boss and well eventually I was given the day off and a sort of ultimatum, I could continue with my ‚Äúwork‚Äù at the hospital or just be done with it and be given all the papers that proved I was there for a whole year (in my country this year of internship is necessary in medicine, plus another one of social service so you can have your medical degree).

By this time I was breaking down again, since I had no way of earning money with this ‚Äúwork‚Äù I still lived with my parents, so I told them about the situation and the offer I was given and how I felt, I never really talked to them about mental health issues because they were not the kind of person to believe in such things and always would inject their own ideas over your own believing they were the wisest in that area of knowledge (well this time my mother was the only one behaving like this, surprisingly I got more support from my father) So I choose to stay at my hospital and I started taking antidepressants, Fluoxetine (some of you may know it by the name Prozac) I took it a few times before but never committed to the treatment, this time I took seriously and began taking the maximum dosage which is about 80mg daily or 4 pills.

Little by little I started getting better, and even enjoyed life and looked for the future, however the pills did take care of my depression but made me an unfeeling ghost, I started doing really risky and reckless things to feel something, I went out with a lot of girls, and a few boys, I did not even care if they had a boyfriend or not, which led to a future problem but that is not really relevant now, despite that and my medication the depression slowly crawled its way back to me, I went from feeling  nothing to be in pain all the time, the emotional one, I think you may understand this very well. Eventually I got my hands on pharmaceutical degree morphine and fentanyl, morphine was my favorite, however I needed a lot of it to achieve a high so I stayed with the fentanyl.  

I just loved the feeling, and everything about it, calculating my dosage, loading the syringe, applying the tourniquet, finding a vein, cleaning the skin, piercing it with the needle and feel that sweet pain as I saw blood inside the syringe, then I would take off the tourniquet and pushed the plunger, all of the pain would go away in almost an instant, and I would feel so good and happy, I finally understood why people did it, why it was worth all of the trouble, the thing literally affects the part of your brain responsible for pleasure and happiness, it was literally bliss in a vial!

With time my tolerance got higher and higher, I wanted to do it every time more often and all of my arms ended covered in bruises, and guess what? The depression was not going away, it would seem that every time I sobered up it got stronger. I wanted to end it all again, however I got it under control, more or less.

I used to get the fentanyl from the operating room in my hospital, I would sneak in at night and was successful at it.

Recently someone hacked into my cellphone, whatsapp specifically and whoever did it sent conversations and pictures to an ex-gf with whom I was on terms of getting back together, needles to say this totally broke her heart and ruined everything, at one point she got a call threatening her, she never told me what it was said to her nor she has spoken to me ever since, I just felt lower than   in any point in my life, out of control, I did not knew who did it or why, I hated myself for everything, for having hurt my ex-gf, and all the people that ever knew me, my family. I just could not take it anymore, that day I was on call, the whole day I was really slow and did not do much work, I just wanted to die.

In my backpack I had some benzos (diazepam and lorazepam) which I used when I could not sleep, however I knew if I took them alone they would just make me sleep and would not kill me.  

I waited for the night and sneaked into the operating room as I usually did, this time however all the entrances were locked so I was able to open a door just by sliding a card into the door frame (really bad security if you ask me) once I got into the storage room I began looking for fentanyl I wanted it so I could mix it with my benzos and finally die painlessly, as I was getting out with the vials of the stuff a nurse that was on call on the operating room saw me and stopped me. 

She noticed that I had taken the vials and asked what I was doing there, I thought about lying but at the time it was more than obvious that she knew I was doing something shady, I do not know if it was fate or any of that nonsense, but if she hadn‚Äôt stopped me I would of killed myself successfully so I just told her the truth, I was stealing drugs so I could kill myself, she took all of them away and we talked for some time, obviously she reported this the her boss.

The next morning I was called by the boss of the Operating Room and one of the hospital‚Äôs anesthesiologists just asked what the hell was I doing at this place at night, I knew they already knew most of the story, so I told them about the depression, the addiction and my attempt at suicide, I was wearing a surgical uniform and my bruises were quite noticeable.  

They told me that I really needed to get professional help and commit to it, since addiction as we all know it is a disease, I finally accepted I had a problem, after that I went to meet with my boss and had to tell him the whole story again (he already knew some of the details) He said he needed to report this to the director of the hospital and as for what is my fate in that place I yet do not know.  

A friend of mine a psychiatrist gave me the number of one of her acquaintances who is an expert in addictions, I contacted her and the only option was being institutionalized for more than a month, for now I haven't talked about this with my family but I will, and most likely I will be sent to that place, as for my career who knows what will happen, I guess Monday is the day I find out.

For now this is all, I just hope this story helps someone to stop before it is too late and to get help, it is okay to be vulnerable, and if you out there are thinking about trying opiates for the first time, just don‚Äôt do it, once you get to know that feeling you won‚Äôt forget it and always will want some more.

TL DR

I am a doctor, got addicted to opiates, started taking pills then I escalated to pharmaceutical grade fentanyl which I got from the hospital I worked, one day I wanted to kill myself with it and mixing it with benzos, and a nurse stopped me while I was taking the fentanyl from the storage room, now everyone knows, I probably will be institutionalized for quite some time and I may have screwed up my career for good.",1556949453.0

Rapid sub taper - 6 days - 4 days no subs. Slipped up briefly one day but got back on it and kept going.,"Hey guys been on this sub for about s year. Had a previous addiction to Dihydrocodeine/morphine some of 2017/2018 and then was clean (although on and on off loads of different drugs, especially pregabalin which is horribly addictive stuff). At the beginning of 2019 I started doing H and it quickly became daily use. First it was .1 a day then .2 a day etc (was smoking it). At first I just got it off the dnm's but then it was the street and that inevitably got me into crack. By March/April I could spend 50-100 quid on crack and H in a day. The streets drained me. 

Anyway - just thought if anyone is my age / in a similar position you can do it! I did a rapid sub taper (8,6,4,3,2,1)mg and then jumped off. After a day and a half I caved to the w/d's hitting me and bought 3 balloons of H. Did one but then flushed the other two, which was the best decision I had made. I don't think it impacted my progress at all and so I kept going. 

A BIG part of how this is working for me and is different than usual is because I actually got the confidence up, with the help of two friends, to come completely clean with my GF and my parents. Their shock is understandable given that they see me nearly every day and hadn't noticed anything. But I had to do it to save myself from ... myself! Now it feels much easier trying to stop knowing that other people understand an are there for you. I realised my habit of concealing my feelings and use in the past had only led to more of the same. 

The w/ds aren't great, they fluctuate and sometimes it isn't nice. But Imodium, hash, bit of booze, herbal shit really helps. Keeping busy too - I work at a cafe - and knowing went to just watch tv for hours is important too.",1556954409.0

I recently came across a good deal for some morphine sulfate wax bead caps 100mg each. Apparently these have the least wax and other garbage of any morphine pills.

Anyway, so I tried to extract the wax from the caps using Dichloromethane. It didn't work very well, so I gave up on that. I may try some hexane later. So I ended up just crushing the beads into the finest power I possibly could and just downed half the pill. I waited a few hours and felt a minor euphoria after 1.5 hours, so I downed the next half a couple hours later. I got a little more effects, but not much.

I am blown away that my usual daily Kratom dosage is 20g and that felt much more euphoric and just stronger in general than 100mg of morphine. I'm pretty surprised by that. Maybe I didn't fully defeat the time release. It does seem to be lasting longer than the Kratom.

What do you think? IS oral morphine really just that weak or did I not defeat the time release properly?

Can anyone recommend a good solvent or way to defeat time release? (Please don't tell me about syringes and wheel filters, I've seen these posts, but I'm not an IV user so it doesn't help me.)",1556938219.0

I am a 30 yo M. I have smoked marijuana for about the last 15 years (shiiiit sounds weird saying that) and quit about a month ago.  Also a moderately heavy user of mostly prescription opiates (beside the rare use of a lil D intranasally/orally, never intravenously) and have used both past 2 weekends both pretty small amounts in comparison since my tolerance is insanely low. Also been using a small amount of buprophorine/naloxone during the week. 

Couple questions..  

After researching, it looks like cocaine and marijuana are the hardest toxins to remove from hair which should not be an issue.  In comparison, does anyone know how hard is it to remove traces of prescription opiates?  How do tests differentiate prescription opiates vs illicit opiates, and what is the average panel test used.

I have read that there is a high rate of success in passing by using a regimen of detox shampoo in the weeks prior, it's called Aloe Toxin Drug Test. 

Any of my fellow degenerates been able to pass a hair follicle test using a detox shampoo? I plan on quitting going forward... but we all know how that goes. Hoping for good news or advice.. or ill be prayin to JJ.

Todoay I went and picked up from my usual source, everything went smoothly but on my way out the car he informed me this bit of heroin is white. I have heard of ""China white"" but being from the UK I have never actually seen it. This bit of gear is almost completly white but if you properly inspect it, the fine powder has a very slight brown tinge to it but taking a quick glance you would say its white, possibly even confuse it with cocaine. I have heard and also read online that you cannot smoke China white however this smokes perfectly and runs on the foil like a normal bit of gear. Once you have burnt the gear on to the foil it turns it's usual colour and you wouldn't be able tell it was white beforehand. When you are running the gear on the foil you can see a slightly transolucent outlining to it which you don't get a normal bit of gear. It's not particularly strong but it's not weak either, a low 7/10 I'd say. So the gear smokes fine, hits fine and the 0.5g looked pretty big. 

I was just wondering has anyone else seen a bit of gear like this or knows what it is and or why it's so pale? It can't be China white as China white doesn't run on foil. In 3 years of smoking I have never seen anything like it in the London area

!! EDIT !!
I was also thinking cut but when the gear was melted it was smooth as glass to run your finger over, usually heroin that has been cut is sticky when melted. Also for how white it was it would had to have been 98-99% cut. But this gear wasn't weak at all! Very strange..",1556926516.0

Anyway, I do their stupid online questionnaire the day before the appointment which by the way took at least an hour to complete or else I would‚Äôve had to check in 1 hour before my appointment which I thought was extremely ridiculous. I go to my appointment the next day, saw the doctor and was completely honest about all the meds I am taking, even the ones from Mexico (20mg oxycodone 2-3 times a day as needed) and expressed to her that I wanted to end the pain I‚Äôm experiencing in my feet and figure out a plan to do that and eventually get off of oxycodone. Well guess what she says, she said ‚Äú20mg of Oxycodone 2-3 times a day is way too much for such a young person like you. We don‚Äôt even prescribe that to cancer patients. I don‚Äôt know what kind of doctor you went to but that is way too much and before I can help you with anything, I need you to completely stop taking oxycodone and quit cold turkey then come back in 2 weeks and then we can work out a plan of action.‚Äù I was dumbfounded and speechless. I couldn‚Äôt even think of a response. 
Later in the evening she gives me a call telling me that she‚Äôs called my psychiatrist and suggested to him that I be taken off my Klonopin as well. Luckily, I have been seeing my psychiatrist  for almost a year now 4 times a month and so he‚Äôs gotten to know me quite a bit and disagreed with her. I saw my psych the next day and he did not agree with anything she‚Äôs said. He knew that I had gone to Mexico to get pain meds as I am completely honest with him. 

For her to say that they don‚Äôt even put cancer patients one that amount of oxycodone and suggest that I quit cold turkey makes no sense to me. If that‚Äôs so much oxycodone, wouldn‚Äôt I require a taper or some sort of withdrawal assistance????? Of course I know this but I didn‚Äôt say it as I was speechless at the time. I could follow her advice and if the pain plus the withdrawals got too bad I could do what many people are doing today when they can‚Äôt find pain medicine or aren‚Äôt prescribed some anymore, go to the streets and buy pressed pills, heroin or kill myself. And obviously I‚Äôm not gonna do that but WTF?!?! I came to her so I can get legit treatment and this is what happens. Fuck these new laws.

A slow warm feeling rushing over
Her gentle hands slowly put you to sleep
As you picture another reality in your mind

Because she wasn't who you thought
She sunk her claws in
And when you left, you got sick

The uncontrollable nausea
Sore aching body
A broken heart
Unable to sleep, eat, sit still
Wanting nothing but her
So easy to fix

But you ride it out.
Day 5 you can hold some food
Day 7 you can eat properly
Day 10 you're back to normal

Almost

You still don't sleep
Not properly
Maybe an hour here or there
And you think of her
Because she will make you sleep
She will ease your mind
She is comfort

And no one knows
Because it's 'food poisoning' or 'a bug'

But you remember her
She was everything you wanted
Everything you needed
She made you comfortable in your own skin
A feeling you haven't know your whole life

It makes sense
Why so many people fall for her
Because she's easy to love

My question is - would having say 1/3 or 1/4 of the 150mg cap today get rid of the sick feeling or add to it? Just like how if one was hungover from alcohol, more drinking would get you ""back in the zone"". Please let me know cus i dont want to feel this way.

I'm no rookie to opiates. However, I started using H (snorting) about 6 weeks ago. I do between .5 and 1 gram daily, more if funds allow. 

I never wanted to do heroin. Despite my use of pretty much every other drug under the pharmaceutical and recreational skies, I always swore I'd never touch it. I honestly thought you could only shoot it, and didn't even know it was classed as an opiate. 

The way it happened, was I was told by my husband, who has ""hidden"" his use from me since we've been together, that it was powdered Percocet. Okay- I know you're laughing, but hear me out- I had absolutely no reason to believe my husband would lie about something I was putting in my body. And he played it off perfectly (""so weird babe, the Percocet guy said he's only got it in powder or liquid form"" with the baffled look and tone to really sell it). Plus, he had only admitted to using pills during our relationship, so I stupidly believed him.

But that first line... oh lord it was beautiful. Everything I love- itchiness, nodding, didn't even mind throwing up because I just felt so damn good.

It wasn't until a few days later when he bought a gram and it was brown. I knew right away. I had been doing heroin. Keep in mind I'm on the east coast of the US so I'm sure most of the shit we buy is fent. But at that point, I didn't even care. 

Now here I am, 6 weeks later, and I can't believe how quickly things are escalating. You see, on the outside, we are a totally ""normal"" and functional family. My husband works a strenuous 60+ hours a week job, and I am at stay at home mom with my 8 month old son. We rent a small but decent house in a nice quiet town, have a couple of dogs, and we're happy. Or it looks that way..

But the reality? I'm depressed. My son has a serious rare illness that made the first month of his life scary and unpredictable. When we were finally able to bring him home, all the emotions from his trauma combined with post-partum hormones and the loneliness of being a stay-at-home parent hit me all at once like a fucking train. I started drinking occasionally (baby would go to bed, I'd relax and have a couple of cocktails). But then I started drinking a lot- and often. I could feel myself spiraling. I have a baby that needs me- I can't be a drunk. But I needed something -anything- to get me out of my head for a while.

I knew my husband had access to opiates. And after being sober for a year and a half through pregnancy and breastfeeding, I was ready to get a little fucked up.

He kicked the can down the road for about a month, always coming up with some stupid reason for why his guy didn't come through. But HE was high, and I knew it. What the fuck?! I tried to convince myself that he was looking out for me. I know now he was trying to hide the fact that the only thing he had definite access to was heroin. 

When he finally got me a Percocet, I was nervous. Excited, definitely. But paranoid that I was sealing the deal of becoming a bad mother and a bad person all around.

I got so high I spent the whole night puking and nodding out, with no enjoyment whatsoever. I guess snorting a whole 30 after not even smoking pot for almost 2 years will do that to ya. I was so disappointed. I had built this up for months now, and I fucked it up by doing too much. 

For the next two weeks or so, we did them every 2 or 3 days. I slowly worked my way up from snorting half a pill at a time, to being able to do 1-1.5 a night. And I enjoyed it every.single.time.

And now here I am, in the thick of it. Watching everything fall apart. Running out of money by Monday every week. Borrowing from friends and family with detailed excuses, while our fridge is bare and the gas tank is always closer to E than the letter F. Riding the weekly rollercoaster of physical and mental decline on Wednesdays and Thursdays, counting down to my husband's next paycheck. 

We were already behind on rent due to spending so much time in the hospital with our son, and now we owe our landlord thousands of dollars.

Our son is happy and overall healthy, and always taken care of no matter what. It's like my brain forces the rest of me to power through withdrawal symptoms so I can make sure he's happy. Being a mom has always been my dream, and I truly cherish every second I have with my boy. 

I just wish I could function without always feeling like I need to be on something. I've never been addicted to one certain thing (besides nicotine) and have always just chased the feeling, if that makes sense. 

I think everyone's got something they depend on. I'm just so scared of losing my son. The ONLY person who knows I use is my husband. Literally no one else. Well, except now all of you. 

I'll be amazed if anyone actually read this whole novel lol. Just wanted to share how I ended up here.

Hope everyone is doing well tonight!",1556845614.0

for instance i hate oxy because whatever quantity i do i wont ever nod, its too stimulating
while dilaudid is my favorite opiate, the rush euphoria and nod are just perfect and i never noticed its duration was shorter than anything else...


but what stays on my mind is all the posts i see about F-ing Opana.  Oxymorphone, to my knowledge, isnt marketed in Canada. Never had the chance to try it, not even heard of it on the streets.
But y'all talk like its the best recreational opiate available. How does its effects compare to oxy and dillys? is it stimulating? sedative? why is it considered so good that youre willing to pay 50-60 for a pill of it? while dillys are like 10-20bucks... and are so fucking good themselves compared to any other opiate even H...

&#x200B;

 

Some background to this really frustrating problem that I have been having...any help at all would be so, so appreciated...I know its long, but if you take the time to read through, I appreciate you!

I am a heroin addict, have been for coming on 15 years. I have had some periods of staying clean, I think my longest was 3 years. I have been in and out of NA programs, never fully committing, never fully believing. In January 2019, I had the worst overdose to date and clawed my way out of that back to some semi-stable ground. It's been an up and down roller coaster of progress since then, with some minor relapses with kratom involved.

Last month, I decided to start looking into the Vivitrol shot. I did my homework, got all of the information I could about it, read reviews, read every Reddit post there was regarding Vivitrol, and finally made the decision that I was going to give it a shot (no pun intended). The first week was terrifying, full of regret and a complete shock to my system. I was very unprepared for the sudden reality that no matter what, I could not get high. Almost like a security blanket of 15 years was being ripped away from me. It was sudden and intense. After the first week, things started to get a little better. I got used to this new reality and although it never felt 100 percent comfortable, it certainly got a little better. That is, until the third week. As soon as my brain registered that getting high would be a possibility soon, it was off to the races again. I felt like, my brain had been deprived of endorphins (even natural ones) for these 21 days and my cravings became worse than they ever have been. I started using and didn't stop for a week (although the high was seriously diminished).

I went to my next Vivitrol appointment, was 100 % honest with the doctor and told her that I wanted to get back on suboxone. Historically, suboxone works wonders for me. It acts as an antidepressant, an anti anxiety and completely demolishes my cravings to use. The doc put my on 12 mgs per day (full strip in the AM, half strip in the PM).

The first thing to note here, is that the pharmacy gave me generics (Sandoz variety). Second thing to note is that when I started taking them I was 28 days from my last Vivitrol shot. I figured that I might not feel the Suboxone full blast, but that after 30 days, I would be good to go.

I started taking the subs, as prescribed, and quickly noticed that I was not feeling better. Usually suboxone gives me a noticeable anti depressive effect, increased energy and overall better mood. For the entire first week that I took the subs, I felt almost nothing, nothing positive, nothing negative. I figured maybe my body metabolized the Vivitrol super slow and it was just taking a long time to clear from my body.

Fast forward to 35 days after the Vivitrol shot. I start to notice a very strange reaction. I take 8mg strip in the morning, get about an hour of feeling pretty good (although NO WHERE as good as I remember suboxone making me feel) and then I get about 3-5 hours of feeling absolutely HORRIBLE. I get hit with a very dysphoric feeling that is characterized by extreme irritability, anger, general hatred towards life, depression, feelings of doom, no motivation and no ability to interact socially. After about 5 hours, this feeling disappears and I'm left feeling exhausted and minimally depressed (although not as bad as the initial feelings).

I have now been taking suboxone (12 mgs a day, sometimes more) for a little over 2 weeks. It has been 45 days since the Vivitrol shot was given to me. I am still not feeling the positive effects of suboxone anywhere near what I remember feeling from them in the past, getting the few hours of feeling HORRIBLE, irritable, depressed, angry, and then returning to a slightly depressed baseline for the rest of the day.

My thoughts are that if I am going to get myself dependent on suboxone again (and eventually have to suffer through the horrible withdrawals from suboxone), than the effects should BE WORTH IT. I should be getting more positive effects, than negative. Suboxone has worked SO WELL for me in the past and I don't even know what other options I have, if I were to stop taking it. I would fall back into active addiction immediately.

So, I reach out to YOU for advice. Do you think the less pronounced positive effects and more pronounced negative effects from the suboxone are due to lingering effects of the Vivitrol shot? Do you think they will go away soon? Do you think it it due to the generic form of the Suboxone? (I have always taken name brand). Or any other reason you guys can think of?

I really need some advice and insight here. I need to know what do, as the negative effects are seriously wearing on me. I don't think I can deal with them much longer but I desperately do not want to full back into using. Thanks guys.",1556823068.0

i originally wrote this post as a comment in response to u/psynougat, who inspired me with [this deceptively simple little post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bjc9ns/levels_of_opiate_high/). It's short enough to simply quote here:
> Pot has a very rough outline of the different levels of being high. I thought it would be fun to see if we have similar levels when describing opiate highs. I am not an expert and I know there are many different types of opiates, but maybe it could serve to help people avoid withdrawal.

something about that little post really got my brain up and racing. i immediately started writing, and after awhile of some good old-fashioned, ""write first, make sense later""-style-spitballing with myself, i came up with what i believe could pretty much be like a sort of opiate user's travel guide. enjoy.


.

here's my two cents

the seven levels of being high:

1. **Not high:** no opiates for more than a week, no lingering effects, complete sobriety
2. **Aware of an effect:** a day or a few days after cessation of use, when if you concentrate you can still feel an ever so slight opiate effect. quality kratom yields an effect somewhere in between here and buzzing. you won't look, sound, act, or think abnormally at this level
3. **Buzzing:** either on the come up or the come down, an easy buzz and euphoria is present. breathing is noticeably gentler. pupils don't usually pin just yet, they tend to pin somewhere between a strong 'buzz' and a light 'high'. you could be 'buzzing' in a room full of doctors who've written papers on the effects of opiates and get away with it as long as you're careful. you might blink suspiciously slowly or slur once or twice at this level. also you might accidentally wear just pure bliss on your face if you're not careful
4. **High:** during peak hours of effect on a mid-range dose for your tolerance. background itchiness that goes away with one or two benadryl, pretty decently strong euphoria, and very self-evident respiratory depression (to the point that one might try to breathe more deeply and quickly because they know they should, before giving up not 30 seconds later). the gentle hint of a nod will start to creep in during the waning hours of this state. it'll be pretty easy to resist it, but the option is there. your now-pale ass' pupils will pretty much always pin by this point. to have a remote chance at being at this level unnoticed during work or a family gathering, you'd need to keep your energy level and cognition *as close to your normal as possible* (overly energetic or overly chill WILL give it away). your best explanation as to why you look like such shit would be a hangover, but that only explains so much. the one caveat; hide your damn pupils. they're going to be a dead giveaway, especially with blue or green eyes. plus if the people you're with know you use, or know you have a history of using, you really aren't fooling them at this level
5. **Fucked up:** during peak hours of a high-range dose for your tolerance. *overwhelming* euphoria and sedation, feeling the nod coming for your ass but just *barely* able to fight it and stay awake (the good ol' pirate technique is the defining sign of this state). probably a lot of respiratory depression but just way too high to notice or care, EXTREMELY pinned pupils to the point that even strangers will notice involuntarily. pale as fuck, red eyes, slurred speech. the waves of euphoria are now strong enough to derail every train of thought, but depending on their frequency you MIGHT be able to get away with a quick phone call if you're lucky. you really can't explain your way outta this one. you will look, act, speak, and think like an absolute zombie. please stay home if you're 'fucked up'
6. **Nodding Out:** when the nod you could *just barely* fend off while 'fucked up', comes back with a vengeance and a fuckton of reinforcements. you would have to take enough opiates for it to be considered ""pushing your limits"" to get to this level. if decently nodding while 'fucked up' is sex, then this level of 'nodding out' is rape. 'nodding out' is the step beyond euphoria and, from what i've seen, pretty comparable to a mini coma. at this point it's flat out impossible to do anything other than sit or lay there, feeling the nod absolutely engulf you. as soon as you feels yourself surrender (willingly or not) to this gargantuan nod, you then instantly skip forward in time to when you wake up, sometimes without any sensation in one or several limbs if you nodded out on top of said limb(s). this may or may not be permanent. the highest reaches of 'nodding out' reach the borderline of falling out. if you experience this kind of nod; this gigantic, completely unstoppable nod that's strong enough to even lead to loss of limbs, you are playing with fire. *there is a big difference between catching a nice, fat nod and uncontrollably nodding the fuck out. don't push your limits when you're at or even anywhere near this point.*
7. **Overdose:** well ladies and gentlemen, you've made it past that pussy shit and have made it here. an overdose. you'd better have a lot of people prayin for you, and you'd better hope to god whatever you just put inside your body wasn't enough to induce a lethal overdose. if not, you are officially grade-A fucked. overdose can range from mild to massive, and if you're at this point, you're either a braindead moron, suicidal, a braindead suicidal moron, or unknowingly used something laced with fentanyl. fent will look at your so-called 'high' tolerance, laugh its ass off, then proceed to take a shit all over you and your mortality. i think most everything about overdose is already pretty clear to most of you. odds are you are intimately familiar with overdose, either from personal experience or (god forbid) from friends or family. narcan can reverse an overdose in progress. always carry narcan guys. for your own sake, for the sake of your friends, for the sake of your family. if you have lost someone to an overdose, you could take comfort in knowing all they ever felt was the nod-to-end-all-nods; they passed on in complete and utter bliss. please be safe everyone. <3

p.s. as you all know, opiate highs are dynamic and can be very different even at the same dose taken by the same person. 7 levels i listed, but i went back and added examples of sensations that could fall in between categories. consider this a fluid scale of opiate highs. idk if youve ever watched [anthony fantano](https://www.youtube.com/user/theneedledrop)  review an album, but at the end of his breakdown & analysis, he gives the album a number scored 0-10; except he does the way i did with the quality kratom line. he gives each album a ""light-to-decent, decent-to-strong, strong, decent, light, strong [0-10] to light [0-10], etc etc. the emphasis isn't on the 0-10 part, those numbers serve more as a sort of skeleton that each review is based upon.  i think that format works very well here. quality kratom is a strong 'awareness of effect' to a light 'buzzing', a mid-range dose of your DOC can be a strong 'high' to maybe even a light 'fucked up', and a strong 'nodding out' could also overlap with a light 'overdose'.

cheers guys. i put way too much effort into this. u should save it, could come in handy. i know i'll be using this comment to keep my ass from dosing like a flaming retard when i find myself with just enough oxy for one BIG dose *or* two sensible, average ones. i wrote this for us as a community. this might even work as a responsibility/accountability type thing. that's what i'll be using this for anyway.

wishing yall the best. may you coast nice and firm into that coveted light to decent 'fucked up'. happy [consensual] nods all <3",1556769634.0

I knew my dad had been prescribed opioids for the past 5-6 years so that was the first thing I thought of. Opioids... the word itself had a certain haunting demeanor, Am I really about to cross this line? This is the next level of drugs the class that heroin is in, the drugs that if I get caught with I go straight to jail on narcotics charges, the drugs that destroy almost every users family and relationship . This is real. Will I be able to do this without getting addicted?..... Fuck it. I go into my parents room when they aren‚Äôt home. (At this point they didn‚Äôt lock their door every single time they left the room for fear that I would break in and steal.) Anyways, I see many many pill bottles but I know what I‚Äôm looking for. I see it. ‚ÄúOxycodone hcl 10mg‚Äù. They‚Äôre they are, a full script too, nice. I open the bottle and pour a few into my hand. Pink pills ‚Äúk-56‚Äù. Wow I‚Äôm really about to do this. I do some research on dosage first. I‚Äôm a bit of a risk taker so I decide that 2 pills should be sufficient. I crush them up put them into a line, roll up a dollar pill and sniffed away. The first head rush was unlike any High I‚Äôve ever experienced, complete and udder peace and solidarity, I felt like I was in tune with my body and mind and that I connected and socialized much better. The next day I wake up in my chair still sitting up, I must‚Äôve nodded off. That was amazing, but I can‚Äôt do that again. Highs like that come with a price to pay. Flash forward to now. Just found myself downing 40mg of anti-diarrheal pills. I need to stop this now. I‚Äôve not done heroin yet, but the deeper I fall into this hole the closer I can feel it coming to me. I‚Äôm not looking for advice or anything of that nature I more so just wanted to share this story with all of you. I feel once I break this barrier of depression And start to feel better I can start putting some pieces back together. But one step at a time. 

TLDR: became severely depressed, weed+alcohol didn‚Äôt help, fell into a rabbit hole of dependency of the euphoric effects of opioids

Edit: also thought I‚Äôd mention that the only reason I stooped to taking anti-diarrheal pills is because I can‚Äôt find any pill plugs any where around me and dads pain meds are now all replaced with xtampza, plus I don‚Äôt live with my folks anymore.

so last year I had a solid relationship. he didnt know what I took, how many, any details and didnt ask for details. he just knew it was something besides weed. it worked out perfectly bc we didnt go out a lot. most of our time was at my house bc I just didnt have the energy. we were neighbours so thats pretty much why. it worked out well and it gives me hope for future relationships. especially after the exp I had a year prior. 

now a year before this (2 years ago) I had been open and honest abt everything to a separate person. my chronic pain. the fact I use opiates to help it. well he drugged me. we had smoked and he insisted we use his weed. I said ok. next thing I know, I am in the mall and lost my purse and keys. I know meds. that was SOME type of benzo laced shit. he then tried blaming it on the fact I take opiates. I was disgusted. I said I have used opiates half my life basically and have smoked weed w it before. you dont randomly have lapses in memory and leave your fucking keys and purse in the mall (which you had no clue how you even got in the mall) 

so my question again is: can yall have stable, solid relationships w chronic pain and opiates ? if so, do you tell the person ? I just dont know wheres the line to say ‚Äúthats enough info‚Äù",1556758945.0

&#x200B;

That said, do yourself a favor and go online to an online pharmacy (there are two reputable ones, if you search the trans mtf/ftm boards youll find the names, or message) and buy a bottle of Bactrim (also listed as ""Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim"").  Buy the highest dose and get a big bottle.

&#x200B;

It's fairly cheap and may take a week or two to show up, but then once you start to get an infection, you can take on in the morning and one at night for 10 days or so and most will clear up.  After the 10 days itll be barely there, but your body can do the rest.  Most docs just give this out anyway when you show up (Ive had it happen 4 times, finally got wise)  **DO NOT STOP TAKING THE PILLS EVEN IF ITS GETTING BETTER, DONT MAKE TREATMENT RESISTANT STRAINS YOU DICK**

&#x200B;

**Obviously, if the infection gets worse after a day or two of starting, or is streaking, or your fever wont go away, or is generally getting worse, then GO TO A FUCKING DOCTOR AND DONT LOSE YOUR LIFE/ARM/WHATEVER.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, buy the big ass bottle of $500 and you can sell some to other junkies and make back your money fast.

Studies have shown that it cures most MRSA and other things like that when caught early.  Ive also seen studies that, when taken very quickly, it can stop endo.

&#x200B;

I use this now, when a few beers or Gin and Tonic's (Has to be plural) will not touch the sides and the mental health wolves are at the door again. As I was about to drink it, anticisipating the storm in my head calm down, it reminded me of something a few years ago...

I feel we all suffer some kind of trauma in our lives and we have (As I read in a book) a moral obligation to dig deep and find light in the darkest moments but that's not always possible, in my experience, suicide, loss of friends, family, horrendous domestic abuse and other things poisoned my early twenties and caused a lasting effect of severe anxiety which completely varies. Once it's in your life I feel it shapes you entirely. I can be completely fine 1 minute and out of nowhere suffer a huge anxiety attack which feels like I am dying, every painful memory or experience is right there in front of me, guilt and panic, anger and frustration. Other times I can go weeks strong, completely fine. My sex drive is high, I want to laugh and love and enjoy being alive. 

I went to the doctor's in the midst of my troubles and saw a lady, this is in the UK. I was completely, emotionally hers, I sobbed and told her that I felt like I was in hell, that often I cannot get my breath, that I am chomping 20 Kalms at a time, I'd read books, watched videos, reached out to friends but the fact was that I believe, still believe, whether I am right or wrong that I was suffering a chemical inbalance in my brain, I couldn't escape the dread, I couldn't sleep nor eat, I felt nauseas, I was crying randomly, out of nowhere whilst trying to work. It was hell, my own personal hell.

This is the bit I don't understand and interested to hear other people's experiences. 

I'd been given some Diazapham from my Grandad to help me at work and having had one, they improved my state tenfold. Just knowing they were in my back almost made me not need them, it was as if, I had a friend who was there ready to fight these dark moments and don't get me wrong, I enjoy not being sober, but back then it was more need rather than want. 

The doctor prescribed me Propanolol, she told me that Diazapham is highly addictive and the only reason elderly people have them is because they are addicted and can't come off them so more often than not they had a repeat prescription. She said they used to have a nickname as 'Mummy's little helper' and we're just handed out like sweets. Propanolol is a Beta Blocker and I am just going to come out and say it, for me - did absolutely nothing except maybe calm my heart rate. I couldn't get them. I couldn't get anything further. Now I use liquid codeine which is an Opiod and I think to myself, had I been prescribed the help I needed for the dangerous attacks that in my line of work could have killed me or somebody else, I would potentially be in such a stronger space mentally now at 27. 

Has anybody else experienced the nightmare of trying to be prescribed any kind of Benzodiazepine?

Well the last three times I bought coke I got so, idk ""excited?"" to use I became extremely nauseous before I even bought it, like when I decided to buy it.

is my body like rejecting coke because its so bad I can't even use anymore without becoming violently ill before buying. I dont even enjoy the high anymore ive done it so much for so long.

Nothing has helped, 4 years ago I started kratom, it was the first time in years, that I felt joy again. I took it daily for 3 years managed to get a qualification for university, found my girlfriend and everything seemed nice.

After 3 years I also used subs, morphine and poppies. Never had to be sick, I always got enough money, never IV'd and kept my tolerance down thanks to Memantine.

A few weeks ago I had an incidence with the law, they seized a package of opiates and I had to stop to keep my drivers license. The acute withdrawal was ok, I had seroquel, gabapentin and kratom to make it 'comfortable'.

But the following weeks were terrible. I was such a salty overemotional asshole, insulted my girlfriend and she didn't know why I suddenly reacted like this. I didn't want to work, I started cutting myself and fantasized about suicide...

Then my lawyer won the process and I started using again. Now I'm stable. I'm happy and life is bearable again. I hate that I need opiates to function but I'd rather be dead than sober...

I just need to talk and rant with my r/opiates fam because you guys understand it all more than anyone.

&#x200B;

The other night I went to the ER. I was in EXTREME pain. More so than usual. I normally NEVER ask for opiates anymore because they don't give them to me and I don't really want them, I, however, always expected in an extreme situation they'd treat the human, not the addiction. 

Whelp. 

I was wrong.

At the ER I told the doctor I seriously needed pain relief that it was way beyond what I could physically cope with, that I need to be treated with dignity and properly. She tells me that she can look into getting me another Subutex dose. I tell her no, I really need a legitimate opioid right now. She goes, ""how about Torodol?"" So, I get that, and a little later I ask her why she can't give me a dose of pain medications for legitimate flares. She gives me a pamphlet that says, ""We don't give IV medications for flareups of chronic pain, but we do give oral medication instead."" So, I asked for something oral and she told me no and walked off.

I turned to the nurse and stated: ""All that does is make people want to use heroin.""

The nurse then says: ""T***hen that's good because it's on you and not the doctor and the doctor's license.***""  So I ask about the oath to do no harm and the nurse tells me he's not going to argue it with me.

It's so fucking disgusting.

IDK The point of this ... I just needed to rant. I get it that I'm in recovery and that I'm not actively using, aside from Subutex, I'm just frustrated and angry that in legitimate situations I'm treated less than dog crap all because I made the decision to get off day to day opiates.",1556674546.0

During the first few days, they had him on a morphine pain pump....then followed the rest of his stay with Diladid(sp). When he was discharged he didn't have a single withdrawal symptom from the oxy he went in severely addicted to. 

My question is this...

Using his situation...you're addicted to oxy, but for a solid week you switch over to another opiate...once the week is up and you stop taking the new opiate...will your oxy addiction be gone?

Ok so this is extremely odd situation but I think it merits getting posted some place for informational purposes.   


I have been taking drug test issued be the US Federal Department of Corrections for the past 2 months, and today I was informed that all my drug test have come back positive for fentanyl (i have taken about 8 over a 2 month period and they are just now informing me)...Which I have not done fentanyl in well over 2 or 3 years.... So lets dive deeper.  


First off - NO IM NOT BULLSHITTING I HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY ILLICT DRUGS INCLUDING FENTANYL NOR AM I AROUND IT OR ANYONE USING IT.  
Second - I have insisted that i get the urine samples sent to the lab to get GMCS aka more accurately tested and will update the results and maybe even post pictures of the results if I can.   


So what could it be? I am on a lot of other medications and Supplements:  


1) Adderal

2) Naproxen 

3) Wellbutrin

4) Humaria 

&#x200B;

I also take a number of vitamins and supplements daily:  


1) High doses of vitamin B-12

2) High doses of Ginger and Turmeric 

3) High doses of Vitamin 

4) Resveratrol 

5) Nicotinamide Riboside  
6) Kratom

&#x200B;

Yes I take Kratom - Which if you even suggest that kratom is the cause of the false positive in the kratom community they crucify you, block you, and call you a shill trying to spread fear.... SO LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR... I DONT THINK IT IS THE KRATOM THAT IS CAUSING IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS Psychically Possible it could be.   


So what could it be... Could the humaria which is a biologic and immune system depressant be crossing with another compound and causing the false positive?    


What is the likely hood that they run the GMCS lab test and I still come back positive?  


How likely is it that something I am eating be it tea, vitamins, food etc is causing this false positive?  


What would be the best way to figure out what is the ""thing"" causing the false positive?   


Please understand I am not trying to spread FUD or anything like that I legit am going through this situation and I am trying to wrap my head around a legit  explanation.

They are humans with stories and families and all of that, but their presence is so unwelcome, like some sort of sentient and sinister mold growing on the sidewalks or the open sores of the city‚Äôs terminal infection finally festering to the surface. They are angry and wet and the dying black souls of the wasteland. Two women smoke cigarettes between intermittent nods. Swollen lids sliding down over the empty heroin eyes. Their thin lips crimped in chemical smiles, while a few orange caps litter the pavement at their feet. Further down, a potbellied man is wiping his feet on a sweatshirt which he simultaneously holds by the sleeve. Another writhes in his sleeping bag, a giant larva in its fetid cocoon. Streams of what appears to be chocolate milk mixed with urine run from it and down the sidewalk into the street. I step over the mess.

However, this is the worst it's been taking around 450mg (give or take) daily- yes, I know really bad. 100% oxycodone in pill form- snorting only.

My plan is to do it cold turkey (as that's how I've always done it and it's the only way I can do it- especially with a full-time corporate job, I know myself and need to be honest). Should I have any concerns or worries by going through the process with a little Xanax and Clonidine as needed? My plan was to use the two together in minimal amounts for 24-36 hours or so until I can transition to subs for a few days. I totally understand the concern and view of individuals against subs but given my job and current situation, I can't be incapacitated for too many days. I've never had an issue with subs and getting off of them. 

Essentially my plan is to use Xanax and Clonidine until I'm safe to take subs and then sub for 3-4 days and then take Xanax as needed to subside any withdrawal symptoms without subs. 

Am I good to go with this plan? Should I have any concerns that could potentially hospitalize me such as a seizure? (zero history of seizures but the idea always scares me for some reason when thinking of getting off oxycodone). Any other recommendations?

I normally get my blues for $35 each so I was excited to try these. My normal dose is 4 blues snorted, 3-4 times a week. I have a very high tolerance. 
 
Xtampza capsules contain tiny wax beads. Each bead is its own time release mechanism. 

There is very little information online on how to tamper with the time release to make it IR. My guess is they haven‚Äôt been on the market long enough for us pill heads to crack the code. 

Here is what I tried: 

I opened 5 capsules into about 3 ounces of concentrated lime/lemon/grapefruit juice. I let the powder (tiny waxy beads) sit in the liquid for about 10 minutes. I then placed it into the microwave for 55 seconds, just enough time to bring it to a boil, then immediately placed it into the freezer. Once cooled down, the wax beads clumped together and floated at the surface. Kind of like when a hydrophobic liquid is placed in water, like olive oil in water. I let it sit in the freezer for 10 minutes, then placed it on the counter at RT for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Down the hatch. 

After 25 minutes I begin to feel the effects of oral Oxycodone. Def not placebo. 

I‚Äôll try and update you guys in the comments as the night goes on. 

Anyone have any experience with this time release mechanism? If this goes well I will be purchasing more since this new plug has thousands of these stashed and they are way cheaper than blues. 

Side note: these contain 27 mg OXYCODONE, opposed to 30 mg Oxycodone HCL found in common pills. The 27 mg is metabolized into the equivalent 30 mg Oxycodone HCL.

So I'm prescribed Oxy 20mg x 4 per day for a month for a plethora of injuries, mainly from falling close to 20 feet and lived, thankfully, but also from various sports injuries from high school as well as played D1 sport in college.  Although, after that fall from 20 feet or so, and waking up in the ICU of the hospital with a cathrader in my dick was unpleasant, but a story for another time. 

I go through the hell each month of picking up my script, drop it off at the pharmacy, pick up, go home, no problem.  I start to put my pills in my weekly counter, so I don't short myself and it helps keep me on track...but I notice my bottle is wayyyy too fucking light/empty feeling. So I count all the pills out...sure as shit, I'm 60 fucking pills short! I start freaking the fuck out, first, because there is no way in hell a pharmacist is going to believe this, let alone my doctor's office.  So I immediately get back in my vehicle and head straight to the pharmacy, because no fucking way am I letting 60 pills of oxy 20mg slide. Not. A. Fucking. Chance.  I tell the tech what happened, she is cool as shit with me, non-judgemental (wish there were more like her)...she's like okay, let's figure out if we are off on our count ect....so about 10 minutes later, she comes back and is like our count was off, and the pharmacist is going to start filling the rest of your missing pills..I take a deep breath for the first time in what seemed close to a hour.  

The pharmacy tech can tell I'm rattled and is being cool as shit with me....I live in a good suburban town, have a high end job, and am legit about my prescriptions in that I don't sell, I don't take more than I have to, and I don't fill early or any of that other bullshit I'm sure pharmacist and doctor's office have to deal with on the regular.  Anyway, I see a new pharmacist walk behind the counter (shift change maybe?), and two minutes later this different pharmacist calls out my name...I approach the counter, and she begins to lay into me about the missing pills, and how it's not their fault (keep in mind, they just counted 10 mins ago, and the computer count vs. the manual count was OFF 60 pills...the SAME fucking amount I'm missing. Not only is she berating me, but she is doing so in front of other customers and all the staff, who anyone within hearing distance could hear what medication I was on and my name, which, again, is bullshit and embarrassing. I look over at the other pharmacist and tech standing there with my newly filled prescription bottle in hand and my old prescription bottle, which I brought back in with me to show them they fucked up in the other hand.  So I'm confused as hell what is going on...one pharmacist filled it, and the other pharmacist is like bullshit, you're not getting it without a new script from your doctor to account for the missing pills. 

So I'm straight pissed now, because I have to go back and try to explain this to my doctor's office now? yeah fucking right, except that is my only choice, so I grab my original script bottle this is shorted and I drive back to my Doctor's office, explain to them what the hell happened, they are confused as I am...it looks like for sure I'm not getting a new script....my doctor calls the pharmacy, talks to the one pharmacist who was willing to fill my script the first time around, pharmacist explains that their count is in fact off by the same number pills I'm missing....Doctor is getting pissed because he can tell this is no way my fault and I shouldn't be punished for half of my months script gone missing because of whatever bullshit is going on in the pharmacy, but at the same time has to cover his own ass with this bullshit crackdown on pain meds. Thankfully, he writes me a new script, the nurses make a copy of it, detail all the bullshit in my chart, and as I'm getting ready to go, the doctor tells me next month we may need to look at lowering my script because the MME's are too high...even though this is what I have been on for a while and it is what he prescribed me to take...so I'm like fuckkkk. 

Take it back to the pharmacy, the cool pharmacist takes care of it...while I'm waiting, the one pharmacy tech that was cool and helpful at the start of this whole thing, apologizes for the bullshit earlier and that pharmacist that stepped in and told me to fuck off was way out of line, given that everyone realizes I'm short the exact amount of pills that they have extra of.  I pick up my missing pills from the pharmacy and head home where I'm writing this now.  I'm sorry for the length of this post, but had to get it off my chest, because I felt completely fucking helpless, knowing how even though it's clear the pharmacy fucked up the count...it's still not in my favor. I feel thankful and lucky my Doctor/nurses and the one pharmacy tech and Pharmacist were cool as shit about it, especially because they all could tell I wasn't trying to pull one over on them...but fuckkkkk that pharmacist who stepped in out of no where to stop things from going forward without this type of bullshit and fuckkkkk everybody who judges people for taking opiates with their holier than thou bullshit attitudes. Wait till you're in pain and let me know how that Ibuprofen/Motrin combo works for ya. Bottom line, I don't care if you take opiates because they are prescribed to you by a doctor, or if you take them because you like them and help you function throughout the day....quite, frankly, good for you, if that's what you want to do, hell ya. But this whole crackdown on opiates is really fucking hurting people and making people like myself feel so damn helpless and embarrassed because we take them. If you read this far, I appreciate it. Hope everyone is having an awesome day filled with the opiate of your choice.",1556578775.0

It looks like regular dope but when smoked it leaves an unique dark blood red trail and has a terrible fishy taste to it. It also isnt as strong in my opinion but that may be because I smoke less becuase at that point I dread smoking because of the flavor. I usually try to switch it out with my dealer as soon as possible and have her pawn it off on less important buyers or shooters who dont have to taste it.

I was wondering if anyone has had similar dope ever or if anyone could explain what the hell happened to it. The strange thing is I've had it from a couple different dealers who I know get from a different upper dealer. It could of course come from the same wholesaler way up the line but why would they continue to produce such a terrible tasting dope. I thought maybe it was just me cus I like the taste of normal dope and purposefully taste it but my girlfriend gags and always says it tastes really bad and like salmon when it's this dope.

So I‚Äôve been told that when you get narcaned it immediately puts you into withdrawal . I‚Äôve experienced this myself  (worse thing ever btw) 

So my question if you narcaned yourself would you immediately get most of the dope out of your system ??  And would this speed up the withdrawal time line ? I did experience it but I used right away to feel better so I‚Äôm not sure if the sweating and vomiting is just the shock at first and then the opiate receptors bond w the chemicals again ? Or if they separate and you‚Äôre completely in withdrawal mode ...


 anyone have any experience with this ? Maybe got narcaned and stopped using if so did you feel like it was shorter or was it the same ? Also was the effects after the narcan the worse part of the withdrawal? 


Thanks guys any help is appreciated",1556572185.0

biufyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/biufyv/update_on_my_situation/,28,https://redd.it/biufyv,Stoff115,Update on my situation.,"I stopped using fenty ‚ìÇÔ∏è 30's cold turkey on the 9th, first time attempting to quit after over a year habit. So as of tomorrow I'll be 3 weeks clean. I should feel great, but I don't. All the anxiety & depression and body pain that made me use in the first place is back and worse than before. Every time I wake up I have a sense of impending doom and freak out wondering if my mom and dog are still alive and okay, and going to sleep takes hours from the pain and insomnia. I got my insurance together and seen a new doctor a few days ago hoping to get my xanax prescription back cause anxiety has always been an issue for me and xanax is the one thing I never abused (I just don't like it in that way I'd rather take the dose prescribed (0.5mg or 0.25mg most of the time) and be anxiety free when I go out rather than take more and get hungry and black out). It took 2 years of going to the psychiatrist for me to even get the xanax, tried everything else but nothing helped and by the time I got xanax I already had to drop out of highschool from the panic attacks. So I see the doctor and he orders a blood test, ask if I've ever done any drugs (of course not, never, what are droogs?) and I start explaining my prescriptions I had before which was alprazolam, cymbalta, & hydroxyzine. He interrupts me and says ""I won't give you alprazolam, it's addictive and a tranquilizer. Let's try zoloft""...WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN I TRIED THAT SHIT ALREADY AND IT DIDN'T DO SHIT BUT MAKE MY COCK STOP WORKING. Then this is the kicker, I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was younger. The scoliosis is fucking with my sciatic nerve and is what is causing a good protion if my pain. I tell him and he says ""touch your toes"" so I touch my toes, and he looks at my back and says ""who told you you have scoliosis? You don't have it"" Like what the actual fuck tell that TO MY FUCKING XRAY OF THE CURVATURE IN MY LOWER BACK. Terrible doctor, he dismissed every problem I had. So once again, the doctors that think they're helping us by not giving us the medicine we need are pushing us to seek alternatives. I lost my insurance and literally had HUNDREDS of xanax left cause I rarely took em, and when I ran out no withdrawals or anything cause I never let myself get hooked. I need to get a job so I can't take xanax or opioids which I have my mom holding onto both of for me, luckily I came up on real bars and I only take an 1/8th of one for anxiety so I got a couple scripts worth for after I get a job. I decided I needed something in the meantime cause I cant live with that anxiety that's being exacerbated by PAWS, so I looked up where In my town there's kratom. Went to a smoke shop but they closed an hour earlier than google said, so I went to my smoke shop I used to always go to and they had some for WAAAYYYY cheaper. So yesterday I began using kratom, took around 4 mg first time expecting an opioid high, but first time it felt more like a benadryl and weed high. Got super hungry, and after munching out I felt great. No anxiety, no pain, actually happy for a change and optimistic about the future. Felt like I could actually get work done, where beforehand a shower felt like a chore and I love my hot showers. Took some again today cause I have alot of work to do, and it felt more like an opioid high taken on an empty stomach this time. & as I was typing this I got a call back for a job :) shits looking up.",1556570392.0
