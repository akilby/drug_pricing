Only low dose methadone and an oxy here and there. She needed clean pee that's dirty if ya dig for a PM appointment. She needs oxy and methadone in the pee but nothing else. So 3 hours ago I popped 40mg of methadone and the 90mg of oxy here that she had set aside for me to take for my pee (we've been very low on dones and basically out of oxy except those 3) 

Anyway so I popped the oxy and the done...laid down feeling nice...waited the 3 hours to make sure the shitnwas in my system and then peed in an assortment of small bottles (to freeze a few for later use) . With that done I'm free to get fucked up. I've been saving .5 of some super good tar, a few bars, and as a treat a gram of decent coke. I usually don't use upper but figured since I gotta work why not...

...so here I am on the toilet warm fog drifting from a running shower with .3 of tar a MG of xanax and just a dash of some coke coursing through my veins as I light up a nice joint of some blueberry x bubba kush while I could still feel the 90mg of oxy and 40 of methadone.

Some might say its sad and Im a junkie but for me these 6 drugs in my system have my morning looking as bright as the beautiful sun that just rose to a blue sky day!!!

Some background: 
I was a heavy user (Opana and Tar) over a year ago. Got clean, relapsed a few months ago and have since then became a successful chipper due to having to hide my use from my spouse. So now my tolerance is low enough where 1 30 will get me a nice enjoyable buzz, nothing crazy. My usual dose is 60mg orally then 30mg insufflated. Although I will be just taking these orally to get the most out of them and I have an empty stomach at the moment. Last time I used was 60mg on Monday.

So assuming you had my tolerance and in my shoes would you sacrifice waking up to 30mg for a stronger high now or split them so you have some for when you wake up? Also, tomorrow is payday so I can get more but it won't be until afternoon/evening.

I know this is a boring post but I have a hell of a morning ahead of me tomorrow so I'm really hoping someone will talk me out of taking both of these tonight.",1430463449.0

(x-post from /r/drugs),"   We're both 16 and juniors in high school.  I've known him for around five years, and we've recently become very good friends.  I'm normally very pro harm reduction; for example, I helped my friends to a source for actual MDMA after they didn't listen to me telling them that they were way too young for it (this was back in 9th grade when we were 14/15).  But this is different.  He's had substance issues in the past, and even though he's since ridden himself of those habits, I feel like he's shown that he can be susceptible to issues of addiction.

He has access to a full bottle of 5mg Oxycodone (one month expired; lifted from his parents).  I believe that we all have a class of drugs for us; I don't want to sound hypocritical when I say that stimulants are the Eve to my Adam, but I believe that I use them safely and responsibly, and I will be taking a multi-month long break soon, followed by extremely reduced use in the upcoming year (Senoritis bby).

And I don't doubt that he'll use them a similar manner at first.  However, even he admits that opiates just seem like they ""fit"" him, which worries me greatly as many opiate users attribute their addiction to the same phenomenon of individual predisposition that he has preemptively applied to himself.  Relatively safe and responsible use is also how most opiate users get started, and I don't want my friend to go down that path.  So how do I convince him?  I've already tried the basic ""don't fucking do those"" approach and the possibility-of-him-blissfully-skipping down-the-path-of-addiction tactic, but like so many others, he thinks that won't happen to him.

A little Googling shows 5mg, 10mg, and 40mg.  And there is an oral concentrate 10mg/mL.  Possibly others.

Are the pills used only for pain management?
Is the liquid only used for methadone clinics?
I think if you're considered trustworthy at the clinic, they may prescribe you the pills for at home dosing?

I know a benefit of methadone is that it is active in your system for a long time.  But compared to a controlled-release/extended-release opiate, can you consider it nearly equivalent in terms of efficacy (i.e. pain relief over a 12-hour period)?

What is the most common ailment that Methadone is prescribed for pain?

""Ow!"", says Jason whipping his head back.

Kym licks the blood off her finger as Jason stares at her repulsed.

""You ARE a demon bitch from Hell"", whispers Jason shaking his head.

""Don't you forget it.""

Jason Rusca.  Known him for 4 years.  Met him when he stole my bike and tried to sell it back to me.  Fought him 7 times, won 5.  Bailed him out of jail once, he returned the favor twice.  One time he set a car on fire to divert the attention of some people who were stomping me.  We have lived together for 8 months and he has paid rent for 5.  His talent for procuring drugs with little to no actual money usually overrides the fact he steals our stuff.  Usually the TVs.  

""Alright"", I shrug.  

I lost $170 and feel withdrawals but if Jason actually wants to lay down and bleed he probably hurts.

""You believe him?"", says Kym slamming our door.  She was wet cat mad because Kym had to go make coffee drinks for 8 hours with nothing but a little weed and my loving arms waiting for her at the end of the day.

""People get mugged...""

""Yeah right!"", Kym says, ""Remember how he limped around for a month to collect work insurance and hydros?""

I laughed.  ""That was classic!  Or when he pretended to be hypoglycemic when the cops picked him up at the Powell station?  Guy nods out in public, gets picked up by the pigs and ends up at a hospital where they give him vicodin for falling down...""

""Fuck..."", says Kym shaking her head, ""Go to Rondo.  Just hook us up for tonight and Jason better pray he comes through tomorrow...""

Kym opened up a People magazine.  This is like a Satanic relic to me.  I never think about, touch or acknowledge her People magazines.  But now I will.  Kym pulls out cash.  Whoa.  Great hiding spot.

""Rondo?"", I ask incredulous.  ""You want me to go to the Temple of Fuck?""

Kym smiles at me as she pulls her fading bleached blond hair into a ponytail for barista work.

""Do whatever you have to do.  When I come home I want a bump.""

""Ok.  But that cash...?""

""Me and Rogelio have a system after the boss leaves"", states Kym matter of factly.  ""We steal it.""

So I went to the warehouse district to see Rondo.  Rondo is a trip.  Always moving and making money.  Started out in a band.  Once he got a limousine instead of being paid so he started a driving service.  Soon he had 3 limousines.  He sold that company and opened up a bakery.  Lately he has gotten into pornography.  Hence the Temple of Fuck.

""My brother"", said Rondo sincerely giving me a hug.  

His office had a window that opened above the warehouse floor where his fiancee filmed fetish pornography.  A man in a tribal wooden mask with rectangle eye slits sat nude on a throne.  Cammy, his fiancée was chained to the floor by a slave collar.  She was smoking a cigarette and talking to a lighting guy that was fidgeting with some reflectors.  When everything was ready Cammy got on all fours and a nude woman wearing a bizarre mask danced around her and the man.  The mask was yellow with cheetah spots and had these bizarre stalks that radiated out like the horns or feelers of a sea creature.

""What is that?"", I ask.

""Hmm?"", said Rondo pulling a bong from a cabinet.  ""The mask?  That's a Giraffe Goddess mask.  Cammy got it in Port Moresby.  Freaky eh?  You can't see the giraffe until you're hallucinating...THEN you see the fucking giraffe!  Here give it a go.""

He passed me the bong.  Inside the glass bowl was a gram of weed and...something else.

""What is that?""

""Shaman grass. Salvia.""

""Yeah?""

""Its OK.  Like a 10 minute trip.  Been mixing it with my nods for story ideas.  It forces my reality to stay open as the euphoria mixes with vision quests and...""

""Yeah ok give it to me"", I said.  

I smoke it.  The green bud masks the harshness but PING!  It hits the back of my skull like a bullet and peels open my eyes.  

The Giraffe Goddess dances hypnotically on the warehouse floor.  

The captive was an Unbeliever.  Chained to the floor.  A forced convert to the Demon Lord that sat on his throne judging.  The stalks on the mask melted in the shimmering air and I saw the beast's horns and crazed animal eyes...The Giraffe Goddess mounted the captive with some sort of onyx phallus she wore strapped to her waist...  

""Fuck Rondo!"", I gasp.  ""Fucking weird shit...""  

I was sweating and my heart felt like it would burst.  Rondo cooly surveyed me.  He hit a button and a curtains closed over the scene right as the Demon Lord stood up all oiled, muscular and fully erect.  

""Want to play Nintendo?"", asked Rondo.

""Uh...yeah.""

It took longer than 10 minutes to return to reality.  I watched Rondo play Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past as I slowly returned to my brain.  The Sprite can I clutched was crushed.  That was intense.  Without the cushion of a good opiate the shaman grass tore me apart.  Cammy knocked and came in.  She wore a robe and smiled at me.  As she hugged me I was aware of her nudity and sweat but this was just another day for these two.

""How's Kym?"", asks Cammy, ""Haven't seen her for weeks!  Hey are you two going to Stan's baby shower?""

Stan was our friend that made us all look bad.  Graduated in 4 years.  Got a job with the city, bought a house, got married and was now was having a kid.  The man kept to his schedule.  

""Baby shower?"", I ask surprised, ""isn't that a chick only affair?""

Rondo laughs.  ""Yeah I said that too!  New world old boy.  Men go to baby showers and women change tires.  But I have no idea what to bring...""

""We'll get them something for the brat but also something fun for them of course!"", said Cammy sitting next to Rondo and grabbing the bong.  

They dropped into a couple's conversation about wine, dildos and patio furniture gift ideas.  I look at my watch.  Rondo caught me.

""It's in the safe.  Blue pocketbook"", he motions with his head as Cammy grabs a stack of furniture catalogs to thumb through. ""$85.""

""You got change?"", I asked crouching down by the open safe.  Inside was 3 envelopes of cash, the blue pocketbook, a gun, discs,  Ziploc bags of bud and a 3 small jars of white powder.

""Nope but here..."", he tosses me a half empty bag.

""Damn.  Thanks man"", I smile opening up the pocketbook to pull out a bag.  

I look over.  Rondo has his hand in Cammy's robe and they kiss.  It would be so easy...but I snap the pocketbook shut, stand up and hug everyone goodbye.

I watch Kym exit the bus.  City girl, eyes flashing left and right, hand firmly on purse, neutral expression and no eye contact with other passengers.  I motion to her from a table outside the Karma Cafe where I have a view of the street.  She sees me, nods and comes over.  I move the newspaper I used to save her seat.

""Well?"", she asks.

""I watched a lady with a giraffe head fuck Rondo's girlfriend.""

""Yeah but did you score?""

""Course"", I said sliding over a baggie.

Kym casually dips a key in the bag and does 2 quick bumps as people jostle by to go inside and order coffee drinks.  Her eyes widen for a moment and then she descends into her sleepy cat trance state.  She light s cigarette in slow motion and exhales dreamily.  I watch her sink into her chair.      

""You want a coffee?"", I ask taking a discreet bump.  The RUSH is almost instant or maybe time has slowed...

""Fuck no.  I had like 10 cups at work...Can you get me an Italian strawberry soda?""

""Sure..."", I hear myself say.  But I can no longer function.  The beast is upon me. 

A wave of euphoria rises like a god above us, falls and crushes us in our chairs.  The buzz of a hundred voices on the street numbs my ears.  We both stare motionless at the passing world.  People with lives and jobs and things to do rush by...They keep going while all we do is sit.  And stare.  So peaceful and perfect is the world right fucking now.  Kym leans against me.  I kiss her hair that smells of freshly ground coffee.   ",1430425055.0

Once television programs FELL from the SKY for FREE.  But we were thralls of the Network Gods.  They would decree What Time and What Channel a show was on.  And if you missed it...it was gone.  Forever.  

X-Files was on at 9pm.  I skipped my study group to be here.  That was OK because only the foreign kids would miss X-Files so I knew I could catch up tomorrow.  Kym came from work but it cost her a Sunday.  Jason...well who knows?  But he came in at 8:55pm with Dos Equis beer, chips and salsa.  Kym was loading the bong when the Knock Knock ruined the spell.  

Only TV can keep 3 people like us from bickering or being rude to each other.  If it wasn't for TV Kym would have killed Jason long ago.  Now someone is knocking on the door at 9pm as our show is starting?  We all looked at each other like Really?

I open the door.  A thin, grizzled red haired guy I vaguely knew as Charles stands there smoking a cigarette and smiling like a loon.

""Heeeey!"", Charles yells like we were best buddies.  Oh boy.  

Charles was obviously humming high on something good.  And damn, life on the streets is cruel.  His teeth were yellow to brown and matched his tattered sweatpants and sweater.  His eyes burned with a fevered intensity from his glistening, pale face.  The porch light illuminated a trail of open sores that covered his arms and face.

""Whew!  Glad I caught you.  Just here for my end man"", spoke Charles rapidly while sucking on his smoke.

""Your end?  End of what?"", I ask.  

I heard Jason slide off the couch and come up behind the door so he could listen too.

""You know"", nodded Charles his head bobbing up and down rapidly.  He sucked in a lungful of air and gasped, ""I fronted you man.  I came through.  C'mon!  $25 or maybe some lines?  I need a comedown man...""

I shrugged.  I met this guy maybe twice.  One of the homeless park people.  I have no idea how he knew where I lived.

""Charles right?"", I ask in a relaxed tone.  ""Charles I don't know what you are talking about.  I don't owe you money.  I have never bought anything-""

""It was your girl.  Yesterday man.  Park.  She uh..."", he gasped for more air, steadied himself and looked at me, his face suddenly knotted in anger, ""You know man!  You know...""

""Charles she was with me.  We didn't see you yesterday...""

""The other guy!  Uh Jackson or Jake that guy...the FUCKING guy!"", Charles steps forward and I step back.  I looked at Jason and he shakes his head and mouths Not me.

""Look man"", I said, ""You got the wrong place...""

""You ripping me off man?"", said Charles and suddenly he pushed forward and got in my face, ""You ripping ME off?!""

And Jason yanks me backwards as he swings the aluminum bat we keep by the door.  The blow glances off Charles's forearm and he bellows in rage but falls back.  Now that Jason has room to swing, he winds up cracks Charles in the skull.  Then he slams the door and locks it.

""You fuckers!"", Charles screams, ""I will kill you fucker thief stealer motherfucker cunt fucks!""

""Damn I hit him hard enough to drop a horse.  Whats this guy on?"", asks Jason looking through the peephole.

""Who the hell was that?"", asks Kym not bothering to get up off the couch as the show was starting.

""That red head dude at the park.  Part of Melo's group"", I shrug.  Oh well, the shows starting...

SMASH!...POPCRASH!

""Fuck!  He's throwing bottles at our door!"", said Jason. ""See?  I told you guys we shouldn't leave recycling out there!""

""I'll get you motherfuckers!"", screams Charles.

""Kym, call the cops.  911"", I say gathering up the bag of weed on the table.

""Really?"", she groans looking put off.  

Back then you could not pause your TV show so she kept an eye on it as she walked over to the phone.

""Yeah.  The neighbors are calling the cops guaranteed so we should too.  This way we are good law abiding VICTIMIZED citizens.  But fuck Kym, hide the mirror and bong!""

""Oh yeah.  Ok.""

""Holy shit he has the garbage can!"", said Jason.  

Then the door thuds BOOM!  BOOM!

""I'll kill you stealers!  No one fucks with me!  ARRGHHHHAAA!"", Charles howls like some crazy, wounded beast.

Then a window explodes as a trashcan lid flies through it.  Kym's scream was piercing and filled me with primal rage.  Fuck this!  Fuck that guy!  I grab a chair and get ready to smash his skull if he comes through the window.  But he doesn't.

""He's leaving!"", says Jason.

I look out the window at almost the same instance Charles turns around and points at me.

""I'm gonna burn your fucking house down!""

With a hole in the window the place got cold fast.  Worse yet was we could still hear Charles bellowing and making horrible bestial screams into the night.  But we couldn't see him which made it eerier.  Then the cops came.  The search lights found Charles crouching in the middle of the street holding a bottle which he threw at the cops before he ran.  Another cop car cut him off.  As he ran towards the sidewalk he was tackled.  

They brought out the batons and proceeded to smack the crap of Charles.  Then they suddenly all moved back as another cop moved in and pepper sprayed him.  The screams were terrible.

Kym looks at us nodding her head and smiles, ""This way crazier than TV.""

I naturally distrust the police.  When I interact with them my respect is due to fear.  Fear they will search me, fear they will attack me and fear of going to jail.  But on this night I was grateful.  Two policemen stood in my apartment to serve and protect my ass.  

""So this guy said you 3 stole his meth...Any idea what he is talking about?"", asks the cop taking the report while his partner stands next to him checking out Kym.

""Meth?"", says Jason incredulously, ""Officer, let me assure nobody here does meth.""  

Jason's chuckle is awkward as the cops stare at him.

""Do I know you?"", asks the cop who was looking at Kym's ass.

""Uhhm, well..."", says Jason.

""Look"", says Kym, ""We were getting ready to watch X-Files and this weird guy we never met shows up demanding money.  We have no idea who he is and he goes nuts.  Look at our window!""

""Yeah.  Don't worry.  Its all in the report Ms. Amiri.  Rest assured the suspect is going to jail or maybe a observational unit until we can figure out what he is on or if he's crazy.  Take my card for your landlord and we'll get him any info he needs for insurance to fix the window ok?""

We thank the police and look at the clock.  X-Files has been over for 17 minutes.  Jason lights a joint and passes it to me.

""That guy...Charles.  Holy shit man!  Drugs..."", says Jason shaking his head.

I was bringing out the mirror as I figured it was a great time to do some bumps.  But I felt guilty and weird so I put it back in the drawer.

""Yeah those sores on his face..."", muses Kym, ""I also scratch myself when I nod.  That's what sucks about having nails because I don't even realize I am doing it.  But if I scratched my face?  Ugh.""

""This is a sign!  Drug Free America man!  Lets not do any H or coke tonight guys"", says Jason standing up with conviction.  I can see the mischief in his eyes.

""But I feel the aches..."", says Kym.

""So what?  Lets get drunk.  Like really fucking drunk.""

We all look at each other.  Why not?  Jason and I take shots of tequila and play Mario Kart while Kym showers, puts on makeup, gets dressed and finally emerges.  Though she drapes herself in black leather and combat boots Kym is a girly girl.  Always makeup, always nails and beneath all the vain cosmetic stuff - always beautiful.    

""Damn bitch you look good!"", says Jason appreciatively.  ""Hey can you hook me up with your friend from work?  Lisa?  Don't get me wrong Kym, you look sexy and my partner here is a lucky man but I need a woman with more meat on her bones.""

""What you need is a shower and change of clothing...at least every other day"", smiles Kym.   

Going from sedentary couch heroin bliss to drunken party ass debauchery is like traveling from Nirvana straight to HELL.  But Hell can be fun if you're a demon.  You just have to get into it.  Kamikaze slammers started off the night followed by Flaming Lemon Drops.  Long Island Ice Teas were the $4 special so we sucked those down as well.  When the slurry blurry FUCK YOU fun of drunkenness descended we got pitchers of Anchor Steam beer. 

Things were getting weird as colors intensified, music pulsated and I could feel an ancient magic descending over me.  Steve Miller's The Joker started and Kym stood up to dance.  As the music pulsed she slipped right into the rhythm without pause as if she was part of the song.  Her dance was slow and hypnotic.  I saw trails coming from her fingers witnessed her desert blood come out in the dance.  From spiked black leather and boots to barefoot and veiled she swirled and I was mesmerized.  Before I knew what was happening I was dancing with her and I cannot dance.  

""You are my bear..."", Kym murmured in my ear as she traced nails across my cheek.  Her pupils were huge and contrasted sharply against her sea blue eyes.

""What?""

""My bear.  I can see your spiritual animal..."", she says nuzzling her lips against my neck.  I am powerless.  

As the song ends we go back to our table where Jason sits staring at the rows of bottles behind the bar.  The bottles are different colors and shapes and appear to be made of wobbling jelly.  They slide off the shelves in an endless rainbow waterfall.  The mirror above the bar is filled with silver liquid and I see skeletal dinosaur fish swimming through the reflection.  

I fill up my glass from the pitcher and notice the dark chunks floating inside.  Jason is lighting a cigarette and pauses to stare at the flame.  He moves it back and forth and we all stare.  Paisley patterns with tiny Mayan hieroglyphics dance in the flame.  I grab his arm and he looks at me startled and then slowly smiles.

""The Universe is beautiful.  That is the only truth I know"", Jason says sincerely. 

I look at Kym who is still staring at the fire.

""Jason?  Did you put something in the pitcher?""

Jason looks at me.  ""Yes.  Yes I did.""

None of slept that night.  Like primitive cave people we huddled around our TV for comfort.  The TV Gods fucked with us and made us watch Leave It To Beaver, Petticoat Junction and Happy Days.  At 7am were all still watching the walls breathe and tripping out on the broken window.  The curtain waving from the breeze became so many things.  A ghostly face leering, an arm beckoning, mole people peering inside...finally at 8am Kym said, ""Fuck this!""

And we did some bumps.  We lasted our night without.  We lived.  We saw.  ",1430541381.0

11th hour! my public defender finds an error in my original paperwork! looks like the shitty judge who gave me my original enormous sentence for some silly bullshit stepped outside the bounds of the law and gave me an illegal amount of probation time. therefore, when the violation in question happened, i shouldn't have been on probation at all anymore. so potentially, no violation. case is continued until july 14th so my public defender, who deserves the fucking nobel prize for due dilligence, can continue to gather information.

OH, and the modification of my probation is ALSO illegal because i never received a written copy and they forgot to have me sign. :D

She spat insults at me and recanted all the hardships in her life. These struggles I have heard a million times. We have come to call these episodes, Korean Meltdowns.  

See, she is a Korean War orphan. Her 1st memories in life involve eating grasshoppers on the streets of Korea to stay alive with bombs and gunfire surrounding her. That is until a nun found her and took her to the orphanage.  Eventually she was adopted and came to live here in America.  When she gets drunk she relives her entire life of pain. I am forced to bear witness.  

I will never forget that Mother's Day. Her eyes glazed over. ""You and your sister ruined my life. I have never loved you. I don't love anyone"" she slurred between sipping on her poison.  

I have learned over the years not to say anything antagonistic when she gets like this, so instead, I nod along in agreement. Fighting back tears from her confirmation of my biggest fear my entire life, my mommy doesn't love me. The next morning she knocked on my door laughing about her Korean meltdown, served me pancakes and never spoke of it again.  

Today I was excited. Last year I was in rehab, so I was going to make this Mother's Day special. She came down (as she lives 2 hours away) and took my daughter, Natty to go visit with her lifelong friend. I was to meet them a couple hours later, after I finished my work.  

I decided to surprise my mom with a basket of goodies. I raced around Target and threw all her favorite cosmetics, creams and other goodies in the cart. Two hundred dollars later and I was out the door. I lined the basket with 2 shades of pink tissue paper and arranged everything beautifully. I grabbed some grandma trinkets for Natty to sign her name to and was on my way. Still starving for my mother's approval and attention after all these years (she abandoned me when I was 3 my dad raised me). 

""Hi mom, happy Mother's Day, I love you!"" I exclaim. Oh no. She is sipping on wine and by the looks of it, she has been all day. ""Oh Liz I love it!"" she replies, as she digs through and delights in all her goodies. Natalia is excited and points out the grandma gift in the basket. Her friend, Butterfly, appreciates the display and says, ""Oh my Liz you are such a thoughtful daughter."" ""Thank you"" I reply. 

We sit outside and chain smoke while catching up and reminiscing the good times. Natty interrupts, ""Mama do you.."" ""Natalia, shut the fuck up,"" my mother demands. My face contorts into that of disapproval. I interject, ""Mom, don't talk to her like that!"" Memories of having my head slammed into a car when I was 11 and visiting while she was wasted resurface.  

""You just shut the fuck up, "" she rebuttals. Butterfly's face wears shock. My daughter looks frightened. She has never witnessed grandma like this before. Unfortunately, I am all too familiar with this behavior. ""I am much stronger than you Natalia so don't you fuck with me. I'm going to teach you a Korean lesson"" my mom continues. ""MOM!"" I scream. ""Don't talk to my daughter like that, she is 6 years old for fucks sake!"" 

Butterfly interrupts, ""Kimmy, maybe part of that lesson should be watching your mouth. I think you have had enough wine.""  

The night continues. I've pulled Natty aside and asked her to not speak with grandma. She says, ""She has been drinking, you know, alcohol all day mama. I am never going to drink."" If only that were true. God, I love her.  

Butterfly is sweet and caters to watching my daughter, as I am held captive by my mother's whimpering and demonic outbursts.  
""You don't know the fucking shit I've been through"" my mother explains. ""FUCK!"" I am screaming in my head. ""YOU DON'T KNOW THE SHIT I'VE BEEN THROUGH WHEN I HAD A FUCKING NEEDLE IN MY ARM, CLINGING TO WHAT LITTLE LIFE I HAD IN ME. POKING AND PRODDING AT VEINS I COULDN'T HIT. DEMONS TORMENTING MY VERY EXISTENCE. FUCK YOU MOM! FUCK YOU!""
 
I remain silent outwardly.  

Her eyes grow cold. The reflection of a demon I know all too well, smiles at me in the darkness behind her eyes, where her soul once shone. I know this demon. My eyes avert to the wine on the table. Do I dare throw away a year and 8 months of sobriety tonight? Can I have one glass to tune out her fucking insanity? I can't deal with this. She encourages me to. I resist.

The night turns to her usual drunken song. Like a dog who's been hit by a car. Lying in the middle of the road whimpering and crying to be silenced.  

Finally I convince her to call it a night. As we are supposed to have a Mother's Day lunch tomorrow. She can't walk. She stumbles, even with me holding onto her. Three times, she almost collapses to the floor. It causes her to laugh. I laugh with her to hide my pain, tears and anger. Why do I fight for her to love me so much? This woman doesn't know love. How dare her talk to my fucking daughter that way! 

Tomorrow we will be eating lunch at Olive Garden. I can't wait to fake my smile while she orders a glass of their house wine and stuffs her face with fetta-fucking-ccini!

UPDATE: She called this morning and apologized. Said she didn't remember anything. Butterfly told her how she behaved and she was embarrassed and really sorry how she had treated Natty. She is too sick to go to lunch. So Natty and I are going to go get some alfredo, and all you can eat soup salad and  bread sticks in our life together:-)",1430631241.0

So, I wanted to share a very important experience about being on Vivitrol.
First of all, unless you have fentanyl, you will not get high while on Vivitrol for the first 21 days after you get the shot. However, after  the 3 week mark, you will be able to get a little high each day. The shot is usually administered once every 28-30 days, so I wanted to tell you guys that if you really want to be successful while on Vivitrol, you must get the shot every 3 weeks to avoid the cravings. I am on day 25 and am currently sitting in my car with 2g's of tar and 2g's of coke, and I am high as hell. I haven't used in the past 60 days so my tolerance has decreased. 
Over the past couple of days, I have had intense cravings. This past Wednesay night I had a narly using dream, and ever day after that I have been craving the dope. If I really wanted to stop using I would have said something about it to my doctor and friends, but I didn't want to because I wanted to get high. I am definitely playing with fire but right now the urge is so powerful that I simply could not resist. I hope those who do want to get clean taking Vivitrol listen to this advice, and those thinking about trying heroin for the first time or upping your method of administration to a needle rather than snorting/smoking realize how fucking powerful this drug is. I smoke the stuff and I just cannot shake it despite being heavily involved in NA and having a bunch of responsibilities in my life (pregnant wife, job, etc.). My wife will leave me if she finds out I am using. That is how fucked up this drug is.",1430607337.0

I have always thought of weed, consciously and subconsciously, as a medicine; a remedy that makes pretty much any situation just a little bit better. Whenever I'm feeling nauseous, anxious, in pain, angry, whatever, weed lets you take a step back and evaluate your situation without being blinded by emotion. A nice indica weed high is, at least on paper, described somewhat similarly to an opiate high; body buzz, euphoria, laziness, etc. But everyone in here knows that nothing compares to an opiate rush.

What I have been starting to wonder and test out myself, but would love to ask from you veterans, is this: is it possible for weed to be a potent enough indica/body-high strain to curb cravings and subside some withdrawal symptoms for opiate use? I think the answer is probably yes, but the real question is, to what degree? 

I guess I'm wondering if weed is sometimes overlooked or taken for granted sometimes (definitely for me, I won't speak for others). I'm currently feeling good now so this may just all be bullshit that's easy to say in my state. But I think maybe it's underestimated in its ability to be a helpful medicine for opiate detox / cravings, so I'm wondering what you guys think.

The first 2 days I felt like shit after smoking it and kept knocking out then waking up to barely feeling it anymore. The nest few days I felt a lot better and started to enjoy it but wasnt getting as high so today I brought one of my friends to his dealer because he didnt have a ride down to the valley. In exchange for driving him he gave me half of his sack and I knew I wouldnt get very high off of a point so I decided to make a change in the way I put it into my body.

When I first met this friend, (lets just say his name is ""Joe"") we picked up the sack and I saw him pull out some cotton and a shot. I have never seen someone IRL inject and illegal substance into their veins so I asked him if he minded that I watched him, he agreed. I was somewhat fascinated and scared by the thought of the process, knowing that he could make 1 minor mistake and end his life. As soon as he registered and blasted the brown liquid into his veins his facial expression changed from vibrant and awake to empty and drooling. I was worried, there was a steady stream of slobber that collected on his pants below and yelling and slaps on his leg didnt phase him. We put the rest of his cooked batched in a Styrofoam cup and started driving back home hoping that he was still alive.

He woke up eventually and apologized for taking that big of a shot and asked where the rest of his batch was. We didnt want to piss him off by driving with the spoon of dope sitting on his lap but we also didnt want him to think we stole any of it from him. He thanked us for putting it in the cup and we headed home.

So back to today, we picked up the sac and I asked him if I could use one of the clean needles he had and he agreed. He explained the entire process to me in great detail before stabbing me with the needle. After the 10 or so seconds I was in pure bliss. I only did an extremely small amount compared to him but the effect was the same. He loaded up another needle for me to take home for later. 

So I got home still kind of high but the effects were less noticeable so I went into the bathroom and emptied some of it out into a spoon and stuck it in one of the large veins in my arms and had to adjust it a couple times to register. I pushed forward and pulled it out and to my suprise I had completed my first successful shot. I rinsed out the shot and sucked up the rest of the dope on the spoon and put it back in my pocket. Fealing accomplished and good I took a shower and hid my rig in my room,  sat down and decided to share this with everyone. Although its a terrible decision to start with that kind of habbit im happy and shocked about how simple it was.

The reason I made a separate login for this sub a few weeks ago is that I knew I'd need to travel to a new place (Midwest USA) from an entirely separate Western country soon. And I'm scared. And I hoped people here would give me some advice. Nothing illegal. 

So in my home country, and the countries I'm used to traveling to,  I've got it all sorted. See, I've got this professional corporate alter-ego to my opiate addiction-persona to contend with, so I gung-ho deal. I use seeds - haven't shot up in years. More than a decade, actually (and I don't want to do that). Buy them legally, takes a wicked portion of my salary. But not as much as H did! And I do it right - man, the bs I've seen on drug forums about how to do seeds right blows me away. 

But I've not been to this place I'm imminently going to before, and I'm not going to be able to get in early to scope and trawl places. I'm visiting fancy clients and moreover am going to be away from home for more than two weeks. Usually I take 1kg seed juice 3 times a day. So you associate the dilemma. And scared-craped-ness.

I have heard about using 'runny tummy' meds to stop hang out - advice please? I've never tried this. How much, how good is it. The seeds I have are pretty good so I'm like a mid level 2-times a day H junkie. 

How likely am I to find seeds in the Midwest and recommendations please? Are portions sold in supermarkets? In what volume? Will I get shit from the cashier for buying? Well they replace the ones I buy daily? What about places selling larger volumes? 

Do you have any other advice? I'm seriously scared. I've done a similar trip before before I scooped out that country and I ended up eating this shit called 'mohn' (cracked seeds with freaking honey or some shit) which is sweetened poppy seed which helped not at all, and my colleagues thought that I had pneumonia. Don't want to do this in America. And not in front of the fancy new effectively-employers. Especially since my stereotypes tell me that the Midwest will not be addict-friendly :)

Appreciate your advice.

Edit - there are comments (mainly PMs) that I want to rely to but I'm going to bed because it is way past that time in my land and I have this corporate veneer to maintain.

I'm curious to see what your guys opinion is on using a tourniquet. There are obviously a lot of pros and cons to using one. They can be tricky to manipulate - right after you have registered you are supposed to untie it then inject, I feel like I need 6 hands to do this...

I finished up giving birth & not thinking, I flushed.  I'm lucky the toilet didn't overflow, just filled up completely with gross poop water.  All they had in their house was the standard brownish plunger.  Needless to say, it's not doing the trick.  So I have to go to work & leave a shit filled toilet in my friends house.  Thank god they weren't coming home today.  After work I go to the store looking for a good plunger, all they had were those black accordion looking ones, screw it, I bought one.  It's not working either.  I need one of those black plungers where the inside comes down a bit.  Ha this is insane.  An insane dope shit.

I'm here in Columbus with my Grandpa and consequently in the city that started it all. I had been doing opiates for a long time before I moved to Ohio in December of 2012. My Mother had died the summer before in 2011. I had used the entire time she was sick from cancer, often times stealing the medicine she needed to not be in agonizing pain. The pleading in her eyes wasn't enough. It never is.

I moved to Ohio to start anew. At least that's what I told myself. I got a job waiting tables the day after I moved there. It was easy money and although I told myself it wasn't for that reason, there's no easier way to find drugs than to talk to a newcomer at a meeting or start working in a restaurant. The two go hand in hand. It wasn't even a month until I had a few steady connects. The truth is, wherever I went, there I was. This time would prove no different.

8 months later and 15k dollars of my Mom's life insurance money squandered I realized that I couldn't maintain an 180 dollar a day roxi habit and conveniently a dude from Boston with even better honing skills moved here and he found dope which meant I found dope and a whole new set of problems. 

The worst of which culminated in a broke dude who had just gotten in a car accident in someone else's car and conveniently had just qualified for full coverage health insurance with the job I had somehow not lost yet. 

And this was the start of my recovery. I completed treatment and went back to Illinois where I managed to start a new life of manipulation with the people I love. Only this time I picked up a crack addiction and an addiction to the needle which left me with an insatiable appetite and hep c.

With the help of an ex I got treatment and haven't found a need to pick up since. Its been hard but the most rewarding thing in my life. My Grandfather knows I'm clean. He can see it in the way I speak with him. In my ability to help. I love him and he loves me.

There's a bottle of vicodin in the drawer. I will not take it. To do so would be to forsake my story of triumph over a disease that claims too many. I'm a success story. Today I am clean.",1430671306.0

It never quit being fun for me, even through the withdrawals, the panic attacks when the police were coming, or when you check for your dope and it's not where you thought you left it and have a mini meltdown, through all of it I got this kind of thrill out of it all. I enjoyed the chaos, I lived for it, life was just one big adventure. There's probably some super deep psychological answer for why I'm going back out but I don't know it, as far as I can tell everything is going smoothly, sobriety has given me more than I ever thought possible, but yet I'm throwing it away like last weeks news. I understand that using will probably destroy all the relationships I've repaired and nothing good can come of it, but I'm okay with that. I accept the consequences of this choice. Thanks for putting up with my babble guys, love this community a lot, y'all are some pretty rad people. Stay safe fam.

34upzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/34upzf/why_guns_are_bad/,37,https://redd.it/34upzf,morbo2000,Why Guns Are Bad,"""No"", I said shaking my head, ""no man.  No guns.""

Jason frowned.  He was standing in the hallway holding a duffel bag at 3am.  I had been sleeping when he came home and told me the 'good news'.

""Milash and Tovin didn't have the $650 but they had this...dude check it out!  A fucking shotgun and cowboy gun.""

Jason was like a child unzipping the bag and yanking out the shotgun.  I saw his hand foolishly gripping the trigger so I slid around his body, put my hand on his shoulder and stopped him.

""No!"", I cautioned.  ""Don't pick it up by the trigger.""

Milash and Tovin are in the coke trade.  The brothers operate 24/7 and sometimes Jason helps them with his Mexican connects.  Jason's coke goes to bands and our neighbors while Milash and Tovin sell across the bay.  Jason agreed to hold the guns for 2 weeks while they got caught up.  If not they were his to sell.  

""I thought you were like a hunter or something.  Don't you want to see?""

""Don't hold my redneck ancestry against me.""

Hopefully the guns were clean but if they were stolen...well who knows?  Guns are bad news for so many reasons.  But I had to admit, I was curious.  

""Ok lets check them out.  Living room.  But I hold the bag.""

The first piece I pulled out was the shotgun.  A Winchester 1300.  12 gauge with slide action.  Well oiled and I could smell the Johnson Paste Wax on the wood.  A well tended piece.  There was also an aluminum gun case inside so I laid the shotgun carefully on the couch and opened the case.  Whoa.

A Smith &amp; Wesson Model 625 Mountain Gun.  I had only seen these in the Guns &amp; Ammo magazines my brother Carl had in his bathroom.  To see it in real life was amazing.  I carefully lifted the gun from the case.  It fit seamlessly in my grip.  The famous Smith &amp; Wesson perfect balance.  Immaculate, shiny, lovely and beautiful.  This was not some junkie or thug's midnight special.  This was a triumph of form and engineering.

""Yeah that old gun kinda sucks but at least I can pawn the shotgun for some cash right?""

""Check with me before you sell anything.  I can help you look up prices.  I'm guessing Milash will be back because these are nice...Like perfect"", I said putting the pistol back in the case.

""Good because I'd have to go through Bart so he'd tax me right off the bat.  But to break even I'd need at least $500 for this shit.""

Bart was Jason's mom's boyfriend.  A scary looking biker guy who begins stories with eye opening statements like 'The first time I cut a man in prison it was with some rebar I smuggled from shop between my ass cheeks...'

I made Jason promise me to store the guns in the closet and not play with them.  Then I went back to sleep.  Kym had reclaimed the entire futon with her long legs so I had to shove my way in and she sleep punched me in the throat for my efforts.

Jason no longer even pretended to go to art college and Kym was on 'academic leave'.  Jason was moving large amounts of cocaine and heroin to bands that toured through the city.  So if things like free drugs, being 22 years old, having a bored, sexy girlfriend and living in an amazing city like San Francisco seem distracting to you - then you can understand how completely distracted I was.

Last week a man in a silver lamé suit was sleeping face down on the floor in our kitchen.  I walked around him to get a Sprite from the fridge for my study partner Vince.  Upon retrieving the Sprite, I could not help but notice my turkey sandwich from Trapani Deli was unwrapped.  Some bastard had eaten half of my fucking sandwich.  The man on the floor had avocado and mayonnaise smeared on his lips.

""He's very famous in England.  You can't just drag him onto the porch and leave him there!"", complained Jason after Vince and I dragged the man onto the porch and left him there.

""You owe me rent, you smoke my cigarettes and your friend ate half my dinner Jason.  Me and Vince are trying to figure out if a fucking ball rolling on an infinite fucking flat service will roll for-fucking-ever and you motherfuckers party all goddamn night and...""

""Hey...buddy!  Ok!  Ok.  Relaaax"", says Jason reaching into his pocket and pulling out a roll of cash, ""Here.  Rent!  And I will personally go get you and your weird Chinese friend dinner from Aztecas ok?  Just help me get him back inside.  What kind of burritos do you guys want?  And hot or mild salsa?""

""Vince is Thai.  Not Chinese.""

""So hot?"", shrugs Jason.

Tonight was no different.  It's Tuesday night and I was behind in class.  While pondering concepts like What if all orbiting bodies suddenly stopped?  How would this change planetary alignment?  The RUCKUS began.

I like studying in the living room.  I have the dining room table to spread out on.  Natural lighting from our street view windows.  Plus Kym's Mac Performa was here on Jason's desk.  I wrote everything here and saved it so I could print it at school.  But unfortunately my roommates liked hanging out here too.  

When I study I will do coke, drink Coke but not much else.  Maybe acid.  Depends.  But definitely no heroin, weed or alcohol.

""Dude take a bong hit!"", said Jason as Kym snorted a bump of heroin off my Principles of Archimedes textbook.

""I have to finish this"", I said for the tenth time.

They planned to go out and see some band and to kill time they started playing Drink Fucker.  A very simple game involving a shot glass, liquor and a quarter.  You flip the quarter and the winner gets to yell DRINK FUCKER!

I give up.  I gather my books, grab 3 Cokes, a strawberry Pop Tart and Jason's cigarettes.  Then I retreat into my room.

But I can't compete with the Beastie Boys from Jason's huge stolen stereo that pounds their party into my study sanctuary.  So I put on headphones, smoke Jason's cigarettes and begin.  As I study adiabatic assumptions my ashtray fills.  I need to pee so I take off the headphones and...Silence.

I am pleasantly surprised.  Did they go out?  But they were so wasted.  Well La Llorna is only 3 blocks but the Mexican bar is Caesar's.  Jason and Caesar have a touchy relationship built on credit, money and greed.  Not on friendship.  But Jason's smart enough to stay out of a Norte XIV bar if he owes money.  And Kym is smart enough...

WAAAHHHHBOOOOOM!!!!!  

I jump up knocking over the ashtray as the shotgun blast echoes off the buildings on our block.  I look down.  Shit.  Cigarette embers were smoldering on the comforter.  I stomp them and in the process knock over a Coke that spills towards MY NOTES!  I trip over a pillow as I scoop up my notes all while cursing Jason.  Fucking idiot.  I take off my wet socks, move my books out of the puddle and go to the living room.

Jason sits on the couch holding a Nintendo controller and Kym sits on the floor quietly reading a People magazine.  The Nintendo is not on and Kym is wearing her 49ers beanie which she only wears when she goes outside. 

""What the fuck?!"", I yell.

They both look at me and Jason puts down the controller.  Though I couldn't see it, I could smell the expired shotgun shells.

""I thought you wore boxers"", comments Jason.

""I bought him those.  Sexy eh?"", smiles Kym.

I realized I was wearing my Valentine's day present - purple leopard spotted bikini briefs.  

""Look you assholes-""

""Ok"", said Jason.  ""I know what you said but I wanted to fire the cowboy gun thinking it would be cool but when I told the sporting department guy I needed old cowboy gun bullets he had no idea what I was talking about!  So I got shotgun shells...""

""Fuck that's so dangerous what did you shoot?""

""Some garbage cans.""

""Jason the ricochet on shotgun blast pellets can...""

""Actually I shot it"", said Kym.

""Fucking figures"", I said shaking my head.  I look at them.  They were both completely wasted.  ""Did anybody see you?""

They shrugged as I rubbed my eyes.  I still had miles to go on my paper.  Cops were definitely en route.

""What?"", said Jason, ""You think we could get busted for this?""

I laugh, sit down and Kym comes over and massages my neck.

""It was awesome babe.  It was like unleashing doom.  So fucking loud and goddamn my shoulder..."", she smiles.

""You ok?""

""I'll let you rub me..."", she said suggestively, ""if you're good.""

I look at both of them.  Jason was starting to nod out on the couch and Kym was staring at me while twirling her hair with one finger.  The whole felony thing they committed was already forgotten.  Nothing registers when you are this high.

3528xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3528xa/oh_the_middle_man_blues/,27,https://redd.it/3528xa,Bun_Killer,Oh the middle man blues,Idk if any one remembers me saying a week or so ago about a middle man owing me a cpl bags and took about two weeks to pay it back well he wants another bag I normally dont mind loaning things to people and usually don't charge a bag for favors like for this guy the other day I took a bus ride to go pick up for him from my dboy and didn't charge him a bag for doing it he ended up giving me one but it was not a requirement well he taxes the shit out of me even if say I only have 20 bucks he will still want one of the two bags I am trying to get so I am paying 20 a bag when I'm broke plus the bags look like 5 dollar bags not 10 dollar ones which leads me to believe he is either pinching them or charging 10 for a 5 any ways I coped yesterday from my boy and my middle man of course wanted to borrow a bag and just like last time same exact story ill have the money tonight well I'm smarter then that I tell him I am still waiting for my guy he says ill get it for you so I say I can't afford to get from you right now which he gets all butt hurt over lol so I explain I don't mind doing it most of the time but basically I can't afford to support my girl and I ha but as well as yours all the time so then he asked can I borrow 10 bucks ill have it back first thing in the morning well I'm thinking to myself I thought you just said you will have the cash tonight now its first thing in the morning well that turned me off from the idea of fronting him I strongly believe in fuck me once shame on ypu fuck me twice shame on me right lol so as the night goes on he keeps hitting me up asking of it will be tonight have you heard from your dude yet blah blah blah not realizing I already got the shit earlier in the day so I keep saying nothing yet he asked again if he can borrow 10 bucks I tell him I have just enough to get a bun from my dude and if I give him the 10 I will be short for the bun from my dude he asks what does that mean I'm like that means I am waiting for my dude to get back to me like why would I go to you for 100 dollars to get 10 bags when your getting 14 and still have to give you one so really I'm getting 9 when I can go to my normal guy and spend 100 and get 14 for myself just takes a short bus ride then he asked what does that mean I explain again that it costs too much for me to go through him all the time and have to give him a bag and also wile getting beat ass bags from him I really think he is charging me 10 for 5$ bags either way he asked one more time can he borrow 10 finally I was very blunt about it and said no I don't have it which his response was ok that's all I needed to hear lol like you didn't get the hint the first 5 times when I was explaining in detail why I could not loan the money lol anyways just to see if he was butt hurt or not I hit him back saying did he still want a bag if I ended up getting anything he was like I already got my answer so no which I replied with ok so you don't want the bag then so he was like you tell me what you want to do I was like what do you mean your the one who asked for it and when I said I can't loan the money you get all bitchy and now throwing a fit saying you don't want the bag now lol that's fine with me more for me right so finally he leaves me alone for the most part well first thing this morning he hits me up asking if I am awake and if I have any coffee I respond when I do finally wake up saying sorry just woke up and yes I have coffee brewing what's up he says he needs a cup of coffee so I say ok bring a cup he gets here starts to pour it and says is this hazel nut it is hazel nut Wawa coffee so I said yea he was like oh I can't drink this lol I was like ok well you know that's what i drink lol why did you bother coming over I know he was just looking for an excuse to come see if me and my girl were high which we were but he dont need to know that lol its not hard to hide especially first thing in the morning anyways he said again he can get us a cpl bags to hold us over till my boy comes through which I said once again I am waiting for my dude and only have just enough money to get what I need from him plus my girl is already at work so she dont have any way to get it even if we didn't have anything already so he was like ill have my money around 2 pm I was like ok good then you will be good around 2 then lol only reason he was saying that was so I would give him some money now expecting him to have it back by 2 pm mind you he was originally supposed to have his money last night then first thing in the morning and now its by 2 pm so I decide to call him out on that and say ypu were supposed to have it last night then first thing in morning and now not till afternoon he comes down and trys to explain he fell asleep last night when dude was supposed to bring the money so his dude said he will bring it this afternoon which last night he told me will be first thing in the morning before he fell asleep so I know ur is bull shitting and just telling me what I want to hear to get what he wants lol moral of the story dont take advantage of my kindness cause I don't need a middle man when I have plenty of connects o ly reason I use him in the first place is either when my normal people are not available or I can only afford a cpl bags when my normal people usually wont do anything under 5 bags lol he fucked himself by not paying me back the first time only reason I gave them to him to begins with was cause he asked foe 10 bucks I had just picked up some fire and said look I don't have any cash but I do have bags of that's what you need the money for it was so I gave him two cause he was sick and didn't want him to suffer well wile I was waiting to get paid back me and my girl suffered greatly cause we ran out early and wile he sits in his room nodding out we are sitting in ours sick as dogs waiting for him to pay us back and that dont sit well with me I scratch your back and you scratch mine if you don't return the favor in a timely matter then dont expect it in the future you know what I mean  and I don't expect him to front me anything but I do expect him to pay me back when he says he will had he said he will have it back in two weeks I would have been ok with that but he said will he the same night then came up with all kind of excuses of why it didn't go down that night then the next say giving me all kinda of excuses finally said his brother got locked up not for the dope but a different reason and he had all the money which if that's what really happened then I am sorry for your brother but I kinda dont believe him any ways I am high as hell and idk if any of this makes any sense sorry for the wall of text just speaking my mind lol in a heroin induced rant about middle men sucking at their job and trying to fuck me a second time lol bit I'm

Maybe I don't need to depend on pain pills after all.

Then refill time rolls around and I know I'm just a couple pills away from feeling better and I give in. Once again. I justify it in my head that I NEED them and that may actually be the case. But I'll guess I'll never know. ",1430921737.0

I'm not judging anyone who uses because I still get cravings but I've recently been on suboxone (the right way), and I've been in the game for a while now. But this post isn't about me staying sober or to preach get treatment if you can. This is to call out /u/Phalanges_Sex . 

I've read your comments tonight on a couple different posts. You say you get pleasure out of other people's problems, and seem to love just being cruel to anyone who will listen to you. I don't know how rough your sex life, and life in general, is that you need to take jabs at a fucking homemade porn on a subreddit, but you're not fooling anyone here but yourself.

Do you really get off on just being an asshole? Your comments didnt upset me, they just struck me as juvenile and mean. Anyone who read your comments knows they are all lies, but lets pretend they are true. Everyone I've met and know, who has seeked help to overcome the disease, knows or heard of the steps. Now if you're 5 years clean, I think it'd be safe to assume you know / did / doing the 12th step. So why on earth would you be cruel to someone who is in the exact same situation as yourself? If you are an 'opium' addict, I'm not going to get into that, you know how fragile early recovery is. There are people on this sub, and opiaterecovery, who want to get and stay sober. We are all addicts, the disease does not discriminate. With the way you've spoken to people here, I'll say you are against the fact that it is a disease of the brain, even though it is defined in the DSM. 

I hope you can shed some light on your actions. I am truly curious. Being addicted to heroin or any opiate is living in a complete nightmare. How many of us have said they wouldn't wish this on their worst enemy? I have. During your addiction I'm sure that has been uttered. And to finally come around, or being the fence about quitting is one of the most difficult decisions one could make. It has been hell for me to stay sober, and I'm greatful for my outpatient group. One thing it thought me is to humble myself , something you appear to lack. 

So please , come and enlighten me about what has blackened your heart so much that you need to come here and spew your bullshit. Or don't, and live your life being completely dead inside.

It starts when you first wake up, you realize you don’t have anything to help you along for that day, you’re going to have get through this day on your own.  And as the minutes go by, it only gets worse.  Depending on how long its been since your last dose, just getting out of bed takes extreme effort.
Once you finally make it out of bed, you reach into the back corners of your brain – maybe I’ve left a small piece of Suboxone somewhere, maybe I’ll find a few pills, maybe, if things get bad enough, I’ll try to score some.  But you don’t ever find any.  You’ve already searched any hiding spot you’re ever had a dozen previous times.  No, today, you’re going to go through withdrawals.

So, once you’re finally up and moving, the deprssion kicks in.  The thought of facing today not only sober, but in withdrawal drags on you.  So you do what you can to pass the time, but nothing is interesting, nothing is fun.  The word flat comes to mind.

But all of this is a piece of cake to what’s coming, night time.  Sure, you take a hot bath right before bedtime, you down some Benadryl, maybe even put a Lidocaine patch on your forearms.  But none of this will matter.  When you try to go to sleep, your arms will start itching and hurting, and you will not sleep more than 30 minutes tonight.  Without any narcotics, your fate has been sealed.

You want to talk about this with your wife or a friend, but you’ve already been to rehab and you’re supposed to be clean at this point, so you can’t.  So you lay awake most of the night, dreading but also looking forward to morning.  For reasons unknown, the severity of the aches and itchyness is the sevearest at night, so at least that’ll subside.

You hope that today is better than yesterday, but either way it’s still going to suck.  Yes, you are out of drugs with no connections or prospects.  You are yet again going to have to go through withdrawals and you wonder, how the hell did I get myself in this situation again?  But you know how, because you did heroin everyday, sometimes multiple times a day, for months on end.  You ate Fentanyl patches for 3 months straight of which you swore you would skip a few days here and there, but you never did.

So, you’ll tough it out again.  What choice do you have?  And you’ll wonder, will this be the time that I don’t ever use them again.  Will I steal my dad’s keys and raid my mom’s medicines again.  Will I call that dealer I know from Ohio of where you’ll traveling in about a month?  Will I look on the internet again?  You pray that you can just be content without drugs, like everybody else.  You’re tired of the hassle, wasting the money, the time.  You swear, there was a time in your life that you lived without thinking about drugs.  But that was 20 years ago.  How long will you have to abstain just to get back to normal?

And then you get to day 2…

Basically uses everyday because he has the funds to do so. The problem is when he runs out or goes out of town and starts to withdrawl he gets severe withdrawls. I take subs and they work great for me and that use to be the case for him. Lately subs aren't quite as effective and he still goes into withdrawls. Has anyone heard about suboxone not working anymore? Has he built up a tolerance? He uses them when he needs to stop for a few days. Do methadone work better? Any other ideas of how to lessen the withdrawals? He knows not to take suboxone to soon after after getting high so he doesn't think that's the problem. If anyone has any thought on this it would be really helpful!

TLDR/- buddy is taking subs to lessen withdrawls but not effective any more. Any idea why? Also any remedies for opiate withdrawals? Loved to hear what other people do instead of subs, maybe methadone? Thanks everyone",1430875811.0

To me it doesn't make much sense buying powder coke at street level prices and trying to make a profit cooking and selling it. Can someone explain to me if this is a viable thing to do?

I don't want to die, and I don't plan to redose, so let me ask, with the tolerance I'm about to describe, whether I am safe taking 10mg? 

It takes 20mg of hydrocodone to feel anything. 20mg of oxy was underwhelming the last time I had it but the greatest experience of my lofe the first time i did. 3mg+ of suboxone makes me projectile vomit. 30mg morphine orally had no effect. 180mg of codeine just made me itchier than any opiate without the sedation or euphoria. I can snort 8mg of dilaudid and get really high without danger, and 16mg of it with coke mixed in.

With that being said, is it relatively safe for me to take 10mg? or should I find some way break this piece in half because its a fucking massive corner and i'm rather worried about the methadone's distribution in the pill.",1430864087.0

There was obviously a reason I started. It's not the fact I've been arrested for a few misdameanors in the past year or so. It's not the fact that I spent all my money I had. It's not that over the past week or so i've been spending upwards of 200 a day on average. yesterday I spent over 400. I tried crack this past week because opiates hasn't been enoguh. I filled my script. I did almsot 25 blues that day. Shot them all. Barely felt fucked up. My ""friends"" didn't even think I used much at all that day. 

I'm sorry if my post is a little rambling. I just smoked a 20 of hard and shot 3 blues so my mind is a little weird right now. As i'm on my way home from the crack dealers house I'm smoking the crack..... I lost my rig so i couldn't come down yet. I just kept thinking about my mom. I just kept thinking about my family. I just kept thinknig about how I don't stop no matter what. I had everything. Literally everything. A nice fucking car, a lot of money in the bank. Not millions, but I had in the middle 5 figures. It's not any of that shit. It's not what I had. It's what i've given away.

I used to have so many friends. My family loved me. I got into a great college. I had a girlfriend who cared about me so much. I had the world at my fingertips. I've thrown it all away. I don't know what to do anymore. I wanted to get into rehab tomorrow, they told me there are 3 ppl ahead of me in the waiting list. Before they told me I could just come. It's so fucking discouraging. I want help so bad because I'm so scared what will happen if I don't get help. My family doesn't even want me around. They don't even want my mom around because she won't give up on me. She's the one I take advantage and get enabled by the most. I can deal with the rest of it.

The fact that I fucking hurt her so much and she never gives up. She shoudl tell me to fuck off. I'm the biggest piece of shit in the world to her. She gave me everything and I've done nothing but fuck her over. Over and over again. I'm so tired of it all. I don't know what the answer is anymore. I just want to give up. I can't keep running. There isn't enough drugs in the world to make this go away.

Billions of people in the world, yet I feel so alone. I wouldn't wish this on anyone. Yet i can't stop. I don't stop. I sometimes wish I'd od so then everyone could move on. I would never do that to my mom though. She wouldn't receover from that. I know she wouldn't. But she doesn't deserve the person I am. I'm not her son anymore. I'm a piece of shit junkie that deserves to rot in hell for all of eternity. The only one who never gives up on me I hurt the most in the entire world. She can't live her life without me. She eats fucking cheap ass food because i get her to give me money for drugs when i can't get it myself. I lie about reasons I need money. She won't even go buy her $800 glasses because she doesn't have the money for them yet i fucking ask for so much from her. I deserve death. I really do. I wish this would all go away. 

I hope if anyone isn't addicted to opiates and is wondering whether you should start. Don't fucking do it. I hate myself for all i've done. I had everything and threw it all away. They say I can get it all back and without felonies on my record I can, but it doesn't feel that way. It all feels so distant. I just want to go away from where I live. Any rehab. I don't care. but no place accepts my fucking insurance or they jerk me around. I don't know what to do anymore because I fucking give up. I'm sorry if none of this made sense and i'm sorry for being so depresssing. i just needed to vent this. ",1430861960.0

Some of this is fake, some real and many events have been squished into one for entertainment.  Mainly my entertainment.



Mary and I were at that 2 year mark and things were going from exciting to routine.  Dependable and stable.  Mary was set to graduate in 2 years and I would follow in 3.  She was specializing in internal medicine and I was studying engineering.  In many ways it was an old fashioned love affair.  Mary would not live under my roof unwed and so our summers were spent apart writing long, tortured love letters to each other.  Well I was tortured.  Mary was having a blast in Europe.  

That summer, Mary went to Italy and I went to Heaven.  Or Hell during the bouts without any heroin.  My roommate Jason started selling coke and heroin and I just sort of fell into his patterns.  A little here, a little there.  Life was the same though.  I still took classes in the summer.  I still wrote Mary long tortured love letters.  Not much changed.  I just felt a whole lot better because more often than not, I was more serene than the Buddha.

I hadn't seen Mary for months when she finally called.  She was coming to San Francisco.  Her brother was getting married and we were going to the wedding.  Mary was a bridesmaid and bought me an outfit so all I had to do was show up.  But like a fool I brought Jason.  Didn't bother to warn Mary.  It was last minute and Jason was hungry and didn't have lunch plans so I figured why not?  At 20, I did not understand the concept of RSVP or common decency.  But Jason had a couple grams on him which was decent enough for me.

""Wow!  You look amazing"", I said honestly.  

Mary walked up and was about to kiss me when she stopped.  Her smile froze when her eyes registered Jason.  I have been accused of not paying attention before but I certainly noticed the rage action on Mary's face.  She glared so hard at Jason that I expected pus to shoot out of her eyes.  But historically, these two never really got along.

""Why is HE here?"", asked Mary before I could get my first kiss in months.

""Don't mind me Mary!"", yelled Jason loudly, ""You'll barely know I'm here!""

""Yeah sorry I didn't know you had to have an invite and...""

""This isn't a kegger with a band you know!"", accused Mary.  

""Yeah look Mary I am sorry and-"", I stammered.

""No band?"", interrupted Jason sincerely.  

Mary looked at Jason like he was a half crushed cockroach twisting around on her dinner plate.

""I'm needed for pictures.  After the ceremony just meet me back at the reception hall"", said Mary.  ""And no Jason.""

Another bridesmaid appeared and Mary's sour expression melted into fake cheery happiness as they skipped merrily off for pictures.  I felt like an asshole in these clothes Mary picked for me.  It was even weirder standing next to Jason who was wearing what he called his Duran Duran suit.  A cheap daffodil yellow suit he found at a thrift store that was too big for him.

""Wanna go do some bumps before the big show?"", asks Jason.

""Yes.""

Hotel bathrooms are great places to do drugs.  So clean and dignified unlike the filth encrusted holes at the Warfield or Omni.

""Do you think people wonder if we're a gay couple?"", asks Jason checking his nostrils in the mirror.

""What did you just say to me?""

""Look at you in your little pretend grown up man outfit that Mary got you!  It's gay dude.  And the way you follow me around in my cool suit...it makes me nervous is all.  I don't want the woman around here to get the wrong vibe.  Plus we went to the bathroom together.  That's weird right?""

""Lets go, its almost time"", I say while rinsing water in my nose.

Weddings are boring.  Weddings where your girlfriend is avoiding you and all her relatives hate you are even more boring.  But I don't care.  Fuck it.  A silly smile spreads across my face.  I look over at Jason and snatch the sunglasses he's wearing because Mary's relatives are staring at him.  And that was when I noticed her.

She was staring at me.  At first I thought it was my imagination and quickly looked away.  But I looked back and she smiled.  She was tall and even taller in her high heels so it was easy to spot her.  A slim girl, dyed red hair faded to pink wearing a black dress that traced a thin, athletic body.  Little touches like her dyed hair or the slender spiked collar around her neck made her stand out even more.  She was smiling at me.  Not a bored to be here pleasant smile.  It was an inviting hungry carnivore's smile.  I could see her sharp canine teeth glittering pearly white beneath hotel chandeliers.  Was this for real?  I looked back and she was still watching me.  

Two people were tying the knot in front of us and she was turned away from the action and staring straight at me.  She stood out like a weirdo that gets into an elevator and turns around to face the crowd.  Other people noticed.  Like my girlfriend.  And I was mesmerized.  Every glance I took lingered longer until I was just staring back...Our eyes were locked in an open blur that did not seem awkward but made everyone around us freak out a little.   Jason elbows me.

""Mary is giving you shit eye.  Quit staring at that chick!"", Jason mutters.

""I can't help it!"", I answer as I sneak a look up at Mary who is GLARING at me from the stage.  

Some words are uttered, candles are lit and Hurray 2 people get married.  There is clapping and people begin to move around and my view of the girl is interrupted.  The girl is now talking to another tall girl next to her and I look up on stage.  Mary is beckoning me but I pretend to miss this and glance away.  A photographer beckons Mary back for pictures her plastic pleasantness returns.  

""Cocktails and hors d'oeuvres to follow the ceremony"", says Jason reading my detailed invitation.  ""I'm starving man lets go.""

In the lobby a classical quartet plays Locatelli as Jason finds the open bar.  There is food and everyone spills out in this area to await the bride, groom and attendants.  But they are still outside with the photographers to capture the city and bay views.  And mercy...there she is.  Walking straight towards me.

""That was weird huh?  Did I make you uncomfortable?"", asks the girl with the paralyzing smile.

Her sea blue eyes search my face for answers but I was stunned.  Prey caught in headlights stunned.  Her beauty, the drugs, her beauty, social pressure, her beauty... All I could focus on was her eye makeup.  It looked like something Cleopatra would wear.  

Confused and self conscious I light a smoke as I struggle for vocabulary.  As I awkwardly introduced myself Jason appears with a flute of champagne and a plate of tiny, expensive sandwiches.  He inserts himself and stares politely at me waiting for me to continue my not so smooth introduction.

""And so yeah.  I am a student and I uh study engineering...""

Jason nods like a fool and I can feel him gearing up to be Jason but she ignores him like he isn't there.

""I'm Kym.  I quit rehab.  Yesterday.  I'm here with my sister and I hate weddings.""

Jason coughed, laughed and nodded,  ""Well said sister!  I'm Jason and also hate this gathering of imbeciles but I am hungry and-""

Kym grabs my arm and pulls me away.  I trail after her and looked back as Jason opens his arms and mouths, What the fuuuck?

""Can you get me high?"", asks Kym as she click clacks away on impossibly high heels across the marble lobby floor.  

The wedding portraits would be done soon and the reception was about to start but I followed her deeper into the hotel.

""But...what?  You just left rehab!""

""Yeah the key word is 'left'.  My parents put me in rehab.  I 'left'.  You holding or what?  Oh I get it.  Your boyfriend back there has the shit right?  Do you guys have any H?  I want to smoke some fucking foil trails right now...""

""Actually powder.  Alright hold on.  Wait here"", I say.

""Not going anywhere"", she winks snatching the cigarette from my hand and smoking it.

""Jason!  C'mere!"", I whisper as he talks to an elderly couple about his days in the Navy.  All lies.

""What?"", says Jason eyeing me curiously.

""Give me a bag.""

""What?"", laughs Jason, ""Let me guess...that girl?  Kym?  Man I was on to that chick from the get go.  I can see where she's coming from!  Trust me man, just walk away son.  Walk away.""

""What the fuck are you talking about?"", I ask, ""Just give me a bag asshole.""    

""Alright but you owe me $40 for this half...""

I follow Kym through another reception hall that was empty.  In the corner we find a table and do bumps.

""Oooohh yeeesss....fuccck!  Fuck!  FUCK!"", Kym gasps as she pounds the table.  She wore a silver bracelet that had tiny skulls and bells on it that made a chiming clatter each time it smacked the wood.

""You ok?""

She leveled her eyes back at me like at the wedding and I felt it again.  That otherworldly connection that electrified my body and made me stand up tall and proud...But on the other hand I felt this has to be some sort of a mistake right?  Why would someone like Kym pay any attention to me?  I kept expecting her to leave or maybe her boyfriend would walk in...but nothing happened.  Then everything happened.  

""The first 3 nights in rehab are hell!  But after that you get hungry...Hungry for food!  Hungry for partying!  Hungry for fucking!"", she whispers into my ear as we make out in the empty room.  

She devours me.  We start to go at it and I feel like I was fighting as well as loving.  Kisses so fierce....

""Oh MY God Magnum!"", yells Jason from the doorway.  

Kym was straddling me and I had my hands up her dress and somehow my shirt was unbuttoned.

""Jesus guys!  Put the fucking drugs away!"", hisses Jason coming inside the hall.

Heroin was on the table.  2 bumps, the rolled dollar bill and baggie.

I lift Kym off my lap, button my shirt and was about to get up but had to pause...Kym is a very attractive woman.  Way beyond my level so I could not stand just yet without attracting attention.  But Jason killed my boner no problem.

""Mary sent me to find you.  Time for reception.  You know food, drink, toasts to the newly weds and dances with your girlfriend...""

I glare at him and he smiles innocently.  Kym did another bump and slides the dollar to me to hit the last one.

""I know we just met but can I crash at your place?  I need to figure some shit out"", asks Kym.

""Yes"", I answer without hesitation.  There never was any question.  

Jason's eyes got big and then he smiles.

""Realllllly?  Gonna crash at OUR place are we?"", he gloats.

""Lets get the fuck out of here"", said Kym pulling her dress around her thighs and straightening her bra straps I had been wrestling. ""You guys got a car?""

""Well actually we took the bus because the Muni drops us off-"", I began to explain but Kym smiled and put her finger on my lips.

""Meet me out front"", she said grabbing her purse as she walks out.

""What are we doing?"", asks Jason lighting a smoke and squinting at me sideways.

I shrug and we walk out into the hotel.  I see Mary's aunt who cranks her head to follow my path out the front door.  Outside were a lot of Mary's friends and relatives that eyed me uncomfortably.  In the light of the day maybe this was a bad idea.  Jason snorted loudly, hacked up a chunk of snot and spit it in the street as we waited.  People hate us.

Mary appeared.  Jason nudged me and I look over.  She is stomping towards me.  Yep.  She was quite livid.

""What are you doing?"", asks Jason with a grin, ""That rehab chick is crazy!  Those Depeche Mode, Smiths, Cure goth bitches in black are all the same and best to be avoided-""

""What the fuck are you doing?"", yells Mary while angrily waving a bouquet of roses at me.

""Look Mary"", I smile looking around...Everyone was watching.  The bridesmaid yelling at the bum in borrowed clothing.  ""I haven't heard from you in a month...""

Everyone felt it before it appeared.  

WHUMMMP WHUMMMP WHUMMMMMMPP!  Deep bass droned shaking windows and bones.  The Sentra pulled up vibrating everything in a 1500 square foot area.  GETO BOYS!  GETO BOYS! DON'T FUCK WITH ME!, boomed the stereo.  Everyone turned their heads at the intrusion and you could feel them all thinking WHAT THE FUCK?  

It was Kym.  She got out and all eyes rolled to her.  The car thumped out a mutant mix of Geto Boys and Lynrd Skynrd's Sweet Home Alabama.  Kym walked up to me and stood there as Mary fumed.  Her voice was drowned out as the bass thumped.

""Who is this person?"", yelled Mary pointing at Kym.

""I was invited"", said Kym leaning against me.  

Mary's eyes were framed with tears of rage but also sorrow...I felt the old times.  Good times.  There was love between us.  But so much had changed.  And Kym, like a meteor from above annihilated the old ways in one harsh blow.  I have known her for less than 3 hours yet I climb into the passenger seat for the ride.  Jason waves cheerfully to people he doesn't know and gets in the back of Kym's car as she peels out of the hotel entrance.

""Who's car is this?"" yells Jason over the mind numbingly loud music.

""My sister's"", smiles Kym looking at me, ""I stole it.  I hope you guys are OK if I crash for awhile because today I am burning all my bridges!""

The more recent reviews say the stamps were fatter than before, scaling out at .08, while some of the older ones say .05. I'm guessing I'll get around .06-.07 each.

I'm already getting one 40mg Opana G74, so this decision is really between 2 Opanas OR 1 Opana + 5 stamp bags.

Which would be more bang for my buck? I'm an on again and off again user, with no tolerance. I'll be insufflating both of these and have a good amount of experience with both opiates, although I have had Opanas more than H. Kind of leaning toward the H for a bit of variety. ",1430848968.0

(mini-review of B-F inside)","I recently acquired some Butyrfentanyl as a sample.  It is really really good compared to what I've had recently (oc, poppy pods, kratom, etc).  My question is should I go for some Acetylfentanyl? I know they're both fairly rare but I'm curious what people think is ""better"".

Now I'm fully aware that B-F is supposedly 30x less potent than standard fentanyl, and A-F is supposedly 20x less potent , but just pure potency ratings aren't necessarily equivalent to which one is better.  Things like length of action, how euphoric it is, etc.

My main issue with B-F is that it doesn't last long at all.  Intranasal lasts probably 1hr for me.  Sublingual not much longer and I haven't had enough to try orally.  The euphoria is super intense though, its like a rocket ship and is almost uncomfortably intense.  Its almost like the cocaine of opiates (complete with mouth-numbing if used sublingually), but where cocaine leaves you wanting more constantly.

So hopefully someone on here has tried A-F and can tell me what they think is better between the two.  

If anyone has questions about B-F let me know, but **do not ask me for vendor info or anything like that b/c I will ignore it.**  If you can't do the leg work like I did to get a source you haven't researched it enough to be safe.

356jpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/356jpf/killing_emotional_pain/,26,https://redd.it/356jpf,emotionalpainkiller,Killing emotional pain,"Hey guys, I've been lurking here a while and decided to post today because I'm down as shit and have no one to talk to.

The last five months of my life have been a comfortable hell. I chipped for about a year before slowly losing control around Christmas time. I found myself doing heroin on the days that I specifically put aside so that I wouldn't develop a physical dependency and get withdrawals. Every day I hatched a new plan to not do heroin that day, and everyday I was back at it.

Just recently, I've been trying to taper. 2 bags in the morning, and 2 at night, instead of my usual 8 throughout the day. I seemed like I might be able to get a handle on my habit. And things were going well until last night when I didn't hear from my girlfriend even though we always do something when she gets off work. I had had my suspicions that something might be going on between her and a coworker, but she denied it. So I cruise over to her place this morning to see if she slept at home and her car wasn't there. I've left out some details but suffice it to say I know she's sleeping with this other guy.

I don't know what her intentions are with him. Whether she's just into him for sex (we're rather forward thinking in this department, but her dishonesty is troubling) and wants to continue an emotional relationship with me or not is undetermined. Either way it sucks. And I have no real ways of dealing with the emotional pain other than using heroin. And that barely works for me anymore unless I'm willing to blow 150-200$ on a day. Which of course I'm going to do today because the pain of heartbreak is just too much to bear. And then my tolerance will just be higher again tomorrow and I'll be more fucked, but right now I don't really care. I just want to stop hurting.

Anyone else feel like relationship troubles made their addictions much worse? I keep trying to stop but it feels impossible in the midst of heartbreak. Thanks for listening all, I love the support this community offers.",1431010844.0

We had a few yesterday which is normal for this time of year. Thankfully, nothing more than an EF-3. Still very possibly dangerous though.

Anyway, I just got my money and was looking to pick up. My dude texts me back and says, ""If you want 'em, you gotta come quick. I'm about to go to the storm shelter."" It's about a 15 minute drive to his place and the tornado is about 10 minutes from our area. 

So, OBVIOUSLY, I get in my car and head out. Now, I've lived here long enough to know that the tornadoes always track northeast. Very rarely do they head directly north or directly east. So I head south a bit from my place, and get in line with where the tornado supposedly is and start heading west. The idea is that it will continue northeast and it'll pass right on by as I drive right behind it. Well, not this time. It starts heading directly east right towards me and I didn't realize this until I saw the news trucks that were parked in the road start backing up super fast and head out. I wasn't gonna try to outrun this thing so I just pull into the parking lot, put my car in park and wait. 

The storm passed right over my area and shook my car pretty violently and moved it about six feet. As it passed, I drove away unscathed and went to pick my shit up. My dealer offered to let me stay at his place since I didn't have a storm cellar. I accepted and ended up getting stuck due to the roads flooding. So I stayed there all night while he and I got high. He gave me some freebies and shit while we were chilling all night playing video games with the news in the background.

All in all, super fun and exciting night.

You can do it (if you are creative).,"I have a dream, a dream that I am sure many of us has had at some point. That dream is to miracleously stumble upon a fat sack of dope, unexpected, unfathomable, exhilarating!

My plan- To hide this balloon that is in my hand at the moment for me to stumble upon in the future when Im (hopefully) kicking. It would have to be in my house where I know I would find it for sure but it would just take some time, preferably 1-3 months. 

I can not hide it myself for obvious reasons, I can not ask someone to hide it for me because I do not trust them to tell me where they hid it as I am throwing myself into convulsions on the floor in front of them with floods of tears running down my face, as I beg them to just ""SAVE ME FROM THIS HELL IM IN PLEAAAAASE! IT WAS A FUCKING GAME, CMON! ARE YOU SERIOUS?! FUCK IT WERE NOT FRIENDS, YOUR NOT MY GF, GET OUT OF MY LIFE!!!
OK that was a little dramatic but you get the point ha. 

Now, I was thinking I can make up an excuse as to have my mother hide a box (with the dope in it), for a game im playing with my GF. But I would have to come up with a reason on why she cant open it or I'm fucked. I dont think this scenario wouldnt work. 

What about somehow having it mailed to me at some point? From myself?  Or a letter saying where its hidden? But who would mail it?

The most reasonable idea is to just give it to a friend and say give this to me as a suprise at some time, but I dont think I can trust them to do that haha. 

AHH I dont know, thats where I need your help. Im in a position where I can spare a baloon, I wont be in this position for about another 1, 2 years? lol

She started taking benzos and has thought about heroin.,"I am the foster parent of a 15 year old heroin addict who has been clean for 2 months. She has never seen any professional about it and the only people who are aware she was addicted are myself, my husband, and my biological children. She doesn't want to see a professional at the moment. She wants us to keep this private. 

She had been doing really well. She showed a lot of strenght and we started to trust her. The first month was the easiest for her because she kept telling her itself it would get better and things improved fast. She was also excited about her new life and how productive she could be. She sat in the library every day after school catching up with her mates (she is a high school freshman because she missed 2 years of school when she was living on the streets). 

Now all this novelty and excitement has worn off. I think she had expected to have started feeling fine by now, but that isn't the case. Last week we noticed some changes in her. She stopped going to the library after school and she didn't go to the rock climbing gym she recently became a member in. This week she had a big exam in school and she wasn't studying for it. The past weeks she did study very hard but now she didn't. 

She hasn't started back on heroin, but she told me that she started taking benzos because reality was too painful. I asked her if she thinks it helps and she said that it did help a little against all the pain, but it also made it worse as soon as they wore off. When she wakes up in the morning she feels worse now then without them. I asked her why she started taking them and she said that she took the first one last Friday when she was sitting at home after not being invited to a party the other freshmen were invited to. She felt different and left out and feared that she would never find friends who aren't junkies. She had felt so left out, lonely and physically sick that she decided to take one. Then the next day she took one because she was alone and bored on a Saturday knowing she wasn't invited to hang out then either. It had been easier to take it the second time, and then she had taken them every day this week because she was nervous about this exam, which she ended up skipping. 

It's the first time she skips anything in school since she came to us. She acknowledges that the benzos take away her focus. She forgets about reality and she fucks up. She stops caring. I told her that she needs to snap back to reality now. It's just one exam so far. She agrees, but seems quite discouraged at this setback. I asked her if she had thought about heroin, and she said yes, that once she had taken benzos it didn't like such a big step to take heroin. This _really_ concerns me. 

I suggested we take her to a physician to see if she needs some legitimate medication, but she is very reluctant to go. She has agreed to see a therapist, but she doesn't want to go until summer vacation, because she says she won't have time to focus on that now. When she goes she wants to have time to properly focus on the therapy, and now she needs to focus on her school work. We think that is reasonable and are looking for a therapist to get her this summer.

I am really worried about her at this point. I have asked her to set a date that she will stop taking the benzos. I didn't go through her stuff and search for them to remove them. I want her to decide to do it because I think that would work better. She has suggested Sunday will be the last day so that she can go back and focus on school on Monday, not letting the setback she had this way get in the way of her overall progress. She has also suggested that she will add benzos to the drugs she won't touch until she is 18 because she can see clearly how they contributed to her neglecting her studies and exercise and committments this past week.

I am happy she is as honest with me as she is, and that she wants to get back on track again, but I am also very concerned. This is the first sign of weakness I have seen in her. I have asked her if there is anytime she feels good and she says that the closest she feels to good is when she goes to the city or plays videogames with my 13 year old biological daughter. They get along well and talk a lot. My 13 year old is a good listener, but she is young and she is usually out with her own friends in the weekends. She could bring my foster daughter but her friends don't 'get' my foster daughter. They just don't click. I don't know if I should be asking my 13 year old to stay home more and spend more time with my foster daughter. 

We do spend a lot of time with her and try to not have her alone too much, but we also need to keep up with our own lives, and this particular Friday that she took the first pill my husband and I were attending a party. She was home by herself. 

Do you have any ideas what a physician might prescribe her if we took her to one, if anything? She asks me if we can have a drink (alcohol) about 2-3 times a week and I give it to her. She says that it helps a tiny bit, and that it doesn't interfere with her life. I just think she needs something stronger. I am worried that whatever a physician would prescribe her would make her more careless and that she might start neglecting school again. 

She hasn't broken my trust. She never promised me to stay away from benzos, only heroin, and she even told me that she had started using benzos and that it wasn't working. I am not upset with her. I think what she did was reasonable. She decided to try using benzos to see if it would help her feel better, but it made things worse, so now she will stop. 

Any ideas what to do are appreciated. ",1430994408.0

I am truly sorry for being so annoying with the way I type .earlier someone was saying that not using punctuation makes me look like an idiot
. well they are right. I am not one to make excuses for my actions ,I accept all the stupid mistakes I make and take full responsibility for what I do. With that being said I want to explain why I don't use punctuation very much . Not trying to make an excuse or anything, just explaining a lil about my background and why I have a hard time using periods and commas ,.when I was growing up all through school ,I was in what most consider the retard classes , aka special ed. well the reason is because i have a learning disability. my issues were reading,spelling, and speech.i used to have a hard time reading and spelling and i used to studer really badly.any way I take no offence to some one calling me an idiot earlier because of the way I type. because I have been called way worse my entire life I am sure you all can imagine the names I was called being in those classes and how much I have been teased because of it so I am not going to go into detail about itany ways lets get to the point of this post. Due to my learning disability's wile growing up I was always behind my peers in school. there is alot of stuff I never learned, and if i did learn it I had a very hard time retaining it for long term use. Unfortunately some of those things is spelling some words and believe it or not I actually have a hard time knowing when and where to put commas and periods. Not that I cant figure it out with some research or having my girl proof read my posts. But it is kind of redicoulus to have to have my girl proof read everything I post on the internet. Also for me to do research on every post I put up which would more then likely require me to type into a google thing first to have everything corrected, then copy and past it .well that would take a redicoulus amount of time to complete . That is why I just assume not even bother. I guess I figured if any one cant read it I would think they just would not read it and move on to something else, but apparently it makes more sense to them to make a comment about how it hurts their head to try and read it or how they cant read it at all due to periods or lack there of . Any ways I am sorry for hurting your head, that was not my intentions at all or in any way.I guess apparently some people feel like I am forcing them to read this crap so they need to comment how it hurts their head or how I am an idiot because I don't know how to type perfectly and that might be true maybe I am an idiot because I have certain learning disability's. Maybe that's why I use dope to cope with how much I was teased as a kid growing up. People think well I'm an adult now so the teasing and name calling will stop. I used to think the same thing but I was very wrong.i am teased just as much as an adult as I was as a kid in school. Just for the record, of you seen someone walking down the street with a limp because of a disability, are you going to go up to them and say, hey buddy if you keep limping around here you wont be able to walk around here any more because its annoying to see you strugle so much. That's pretty much what someone commented to me saying, I should care about my punctuation because if I keep getting down voted I wont be able to post or comment any more. If that is the case perhaps this is not the community for me, which is pretty sad because at first I really felt accepted here and comfortable here but now I am just reminded of my school days which none are very good memories at all.with that being said I'm gonna go nod out in peace, so peace out every one be safe out there. the world is and will always be a very cruel and fucked up  place ",1430962156.0

Withdrawals won't be too big an issue, but how the hell am I supposed to live 14 days with no opiates? How do I pass the time?","Serious question, what can I realistically do to help those 14 days pass by? I've got issues with depression as it is and going opiate-free makes me feel completely dead inside. Like nothing is fun, nothing is cool, nothing is sad, nothing is infuriating. I'm just kind of floating emotionless through this tunnel where everything's moving in slow motion and all I want to do is fast forward two weeks to feel normal again. I mean, at this point, I don't even have to feel happy, if I could just feel sad or angry or any other negative emotion, I'd be content. I'd have something to focus on and could at least pass the time wallowing in my own self-pity but nope, I don't even get that. Just a weird, empty feeling where everything leaves me bored and disappointed. I realized a long time ago that the psychological addiction was far more difficult for me to kick than the physical, but in the past two years the longest I've gone without opiates was around 5 or 6 days. The worst part is I'm prescribed adderall and klonopin and could easily abuse either but the highs just feel like lows without that opiate glow.

I want to do this. I want to prove to myself that I can go two weeks, at the very least, with no drugs. However, if I don't find some enjoyment in something to help the days pass, I know for a fact I'll be right back to using in a few days. I chose to wait until I graduated from college to do this so I wouldn't have any obligations but I'm starting to think this was an even worse idea because doing nothing is an awful way to pass time.

Any suggestions? Did anyone else have these issues of emptiness and apathy when quitting or taking a break?",1430950840.0

a little backstory first: I was going through a pretty rough patch earlier this year and I made the mistake to dabble in opioids. It got to the point where I'd need the equivalent of about 120mg of Morphine to get high. After a while, I finally found a connect for Oxy and started snorting. I lost all control pretty much and was terrible at saving my shit. I ran through 200mg within four days, which is a lot for someone who has never done Oxy before I guess.

So basically I spent about three months of chipping about 120mg of Morphine a week and then one or two weeks of binging on oxy. I haven't used in two weeks because I feel better now in every aspect of life, academically, socially - things are looking up finally. However, I still find myself reminiscing about lines of finely crushed pills and the warm and blissful joy that came with them. I have no physical WD symptoms though, it's all in my head.

So I'm asking you how I should resolve this for good. I've cut all ties with dealers and so on but the feeling just creeps up on me very now and then - goddamn railing a 40 would be nice right about now. How did you overcome this? I don't want to get involved with opiates ever again, I have way too much of an addictive personality to stay chippin'.",1430948025.0

I stupidly did finalize because I was a little desperate at the time and my normal guy was out. I took 6 30mgs for a total of 180 and felt NOTHING. My tolerance is around 90mgs and I have never taken more than 150mg in a day. I can say 100% without a doubt these aren't the real deal.

The pills crumble in your hand once any pressure is put on them, they taste NOTHING like oxy and the markings on the front can be removed with a slight wipe from your finger.

This is all they say. They do not elaborate on exactly why it's not recommended. I have no idea what the issue might be. 

Is this about danger? Is it about lower bio-availability with snorting vs IV? Is it because it's inefficient and IV is the most bang for your buck? Is it because IV produces more pleasant effects than snorting?

I was doing it it twice a week for a month or so. But the problem is that it would still be high the day after using. And to be honest I didn't want to be high for more than one day.. I def did not want to be high all night and not be able to sleep. 

I didn't like that my body was being marinated in opiods while I really just want to sleep and be sober the next day. And the mild high and afterglow on the second day was just a nuicanse. It wasn't enjoyable it just made it harder not to use again. 

I ended up doing it 3 and the 4 times a week. I would at least leave 1 day in between.. but with the long half life that wasn't enough. It did decrease the tolerance build greatly but I was still setting myself up for withdrawal. 

I was doing 2-3 pounds throughout the day of the highest potency seeds I could find online and finally I got really bored with it and decided to quit. Withdrawals weren't intense.. they were just really long. 

And again.. if I'm going to withdraw it might as well hurt like a bitch for 5 days instead of just being majorrly uncomfortable and depressed for 10 days.

I am her boss.  This is why it never fails to amaze me that she shamelessly claws after my job and openly complains about me to our superiors.  But Zoe is a not new creature.  I have worked long enough to know her type which is why I study her intently as she babbles about Aeronautical Emission Standards.  Zoe lacks poise and polish and speaks too fast in her high, tinny voice.  Her horse teeth don't help either.  But she is young and ambitious.  If she wasn't so socially awkward she would climb faster.  People like Zoe have intellectual merit yet lack social finesse.  They are embarrassing at company parties.  I glance at her slides praying none of my points are in there.  This bitch has stolen from me before.  

But I steal too.  From her and anyone else.  We all do.  Fucking corporate douche bags braying like donkeys for the 3 executives in the room.  This is the worst kind of meeting.  No snacks, no birthday cakes, no fucking point.  Just a room full of dimwits who should be working but have instead made elaborate presentations about what they WOULD be doing IF they were actually working.  My phone vibrates like a heartbeat against my leg.  I live by The Code.  It is 10:00am.  The Code says take some oxy so I casually palm a pill, crunch it up and sip coffee.  Doctor's orders.

I will not do heroin at work.  This environment is too unpredictable and wild.  The stakes are way too high to be that fucked up.  This meeting popped up 30 minutes ago.  People scramble like motherfuckers to justify their livelihoods.  They think of mortgages, their children's futures and social status as they prove themselves valuable and irreplaceable.  This is fucked up and wrong but EXACTLY the kind of shit people with power enjoy pulling.  Like a dog humping your leg, the executives enjoy displays of power.  So you must be ready.  And heroin is not a ready drug.   

Ahh but oxycodone...Now that is a corporate drug!  Thebaine stimulates you and gives you that winning smile and firm handshake!  Helps you bellow out HI HOW ARE YOU DOING BOB!  GREAT TO SEE YA BUDDY! - when you actually hate Bob and fantasize about slitting his fat fucking throat.

I can see Bob's blood drip down my arm as Zoe rushes her last point and Dan the Man VP of Sales asks for clarification.  This makes Zoe turn bright red with shame.  Like Bob's blood.  She mutters her final points.  I can't help but notice that 2 of her 3 points are criticisms against her boss who happens to be me.  But no one cares.  She lost momentum, sits down and stares at her feet.  

Ahh, my turn.  I look at her but she refuses to meet my gaze.  Attack your boss in a meeting eh?  With a casual flick I turn off the monitor behind me that casts Zoe's presentation.  I don't need any spreadsheets or graphs.  That filler is for pussies.  I work from memory for I am pro.   I lay out hard facts and point out flaws.  Zoe's flaws.  I slam her in everything but name.  Leaving her nameless screams ZOE much louder.  

I am known for this no nonsense approach.  It is the Mask I wear at work.  5 minutes into my presentation I feel the first little fingerlings of euphoria reach up and tickle the back my brain.  Ohhhh yeahhhh....By the end of my little show I have presented a positive spin, a solid schedule plus a novel solution I thought up while standing there.  Before I take my seat I wink at the cute intern who is taking Meeting Notes.  

Then I look at Zoe the Soulless.  YOU FEEL THAT YOU HORSE FACED BITCH?    

As the rush hits me full strength the meeting ends and I walk out with The Boys.  Executive level go-getter, plastic-faced douche bags.  We speak of professional sports, island getaways and real estate margins.  But on the way back to my office I sit with my nemesis Zoe and her team.  I put on a Pleasant Mask as we talk of coffee, weather and lunch spots.  I let my oxycodone fueled charisma ooze out over her staff.  They love me for Zoe is an unpleasant hard ass.  The type of person who doesn't understand the concept of tipping makes a cruel boss.  

But I buy everyone bagels and muffins because I understand the Game.  And I make nice with Zoe.  We talk about her parrot.  That fucking bird is the closest clue we have that Zoe is a mammal with feelings.  So I praise the parrot to lower Zoe's guard.   Fucking screwy bitch.  I gently let her know where she fucked up so we can fix it.  She accepts this.  I know she grows smarter with each blow but we need to stay competitive.  China is kicking our ass.  I give her more resources to show her that I do not harbor grudges even though I KNOW and YOU KNOW you just tried to FUCK me in front of the executives.  

But I need Zoe.  In reality she does 85% of my work while I sit around high as fuck reading Reddit.  

My lunch is ruined as an ambitious newly minted engineer nervously sits near me to talk about her 2016 goals.  My roast beef sandwich could be a thing of art.  Freshly baked bread, thinly sliced Prime Rib, organic butter lettuce and vine ripened tomato with just a dab of mayonnaise...but no.  Not even the artisan potato chips help.  I must talk.  I hate talking when I could be eating.  But the oxy helps.  I let her feel good for I know what a long walk it was to approach me when I am eating alone.  She means well.  But in my mind I make a mental note to go out tomorrow so I can eat in peace.

At 1pm The Code buzzes me and I chew another pill.  God damn what a beautiful day.  Actually its raining, gray and miserable but I feel awesome.  I feel so awesome I get up and leave.  Fuck this place.  I have programmed my planner app to release my report summaries and schedules at exactly 6:13pm in case my bosses are checking time stamps.  

The newspaper kiosk guy hates me.  But to be fair, he hates everyone.  Working a kiosk in a train station exposes him to a cross section of humanity that is just too disgusting to contemplate.  He argues with a woman who complains her shitty $2 coffee sucks.  His command of the English language does not allow him to scream BITCH IT'S $2 COFFEE WHAT DO YOU WANT?!  

As she proves what an unpleasant fuck of a human being she is I think of reaching over and stealing a pack of smokes.  No one would suspect me in my office disguise.  So I reach over and grab one.  I palm it casually.  I can walk away.  But I don't.  I pay for it and leave as he scowls at me because he KNOWS what I did.

Would the younger me have stolen those smokes?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe I was never that kind of a person....Wow.  Me the Nice Guy?  Really?  I contemplate this as I wait for a train to get out of here.  Damn its only Wednesday.  Wednesday is the asshole of the work week.  

Once I'm in my seat I look around.  I know no one in the car.  I take off my corporate Mask and sigh with relief.  Barely pulled 5 hours today.  Without my Mask I am a fragile, frightened human being.  Afraid of the world, afraid of the future and afraid of myself and what I have become.  Is this what it feels like to be old?, I wonder rubbing my face.    

The kid that sits next to me on the train reeks of bread and pizza.  His eyes are dead and he is clearly exhausted.  Someone rode his ass for 8 solid hours.  The burns on his forearms are familiar as I worked a bakery job in school and know those baking rack scars well.  

I feel tired and spent because I was up late last night being high.  I feel ripped off because I spent my lunch talking about work.  But this kid covered in flour?  That is real work and for not much pay at all I bet.  I can see the kid's phone and he's looking at Craigslist rental listings.  Is he being kicked out?  Is he moving?  Hell, my only concern is If I run out of oxy will my house of cards lifestyle crumble?  

But then the train departs.  The kid puts on headphones and zonks out.  I sit back and fall under the humming spell of travel as I stare out the window.  2 more days of this shit and the weekend comes.  I yawn and go back on Reddit.  God these fucking suboxone questions...",1430935958.0

So for those that might not have read my earlier plaintive post, I'm traveling to the US Midwest next week. I'll be there a few weeks and I'm scared about how I'll feel during that time. It's a new job and I'm supposed to be perky. Or something. My concerns about how I'm a sarcastic mofo and they're all into bigging one another up **even when not warranted** grates. Which will be harder when I'm hanging. They're so fracking nice. Maybe it'd be better working for a Commonwealth company - the Commonwealth knows sarcasm! 

Sigh. 

Anyhow. 

I think the people here have helped me, though that'll only be proven after I arrive. But I have a good feeling. I'm less scared than I was when I started this and I want to thank each and every one of you that helped me out. If you are traveling and need some help in southern climes please hit me up - I am about poppy seeds these days which will keep you okay if you have a trip. But when I say help, I'll do it in a material fashion with car rides to wholesalers or something. 

Thank you all. And if anyone wants to talk to me about my Midwestern trip,  PM because I would certainly appreciate more advice. 

Thank you again. Xox.",1431088857.0

I've been smoking dope for a few years and only now just starting noticing it. It came on slowly, but now its happening consistently and frequently throughout the day. They don't seem to be concentrated in any single spot, it's sorta throughout my whole body. I'm not 100% sure it's the dope, but i'm getting really worried. I do have a xanax script, but only in small doses and not habitually. 


Does anyone else experience this? They aren't so strong that i'm throwing things across the room or falling in the shower. Most are small twitches, but some are pretty strong (I sometimes bang the keyboard at my desk while typing). I'll probably see a doctor soon but would like to get some input on this in the mean time. Thanks.


*edit:  I should add that I notice the muscle jerks happen a lot more often when i'm sitting or laying down. It seems that when i'm up doing something, or when my mind is occupied doing something, the spasms don't occur as often. It's when i'm on the computer, watching tv, or trying to fall asleep when that they get worse.",1431076493.0

I know the knee-jerk too hearing anyone switching to H and tapering could be to say to avoid it. 

I'm currently addicted to Poppy Seed Tea of some rather potent seeds - the half=life is huge. My plan was to switch to H for 3/4 days (I don't really have a legit way to get it, but could get a small amount) and then tapering off that.

The silvery dress was not something Kym would ever buy.  It was a different brand of feminine charm from her usual black, gothic vamp style.  I watch the dress cascade like water over her slim, curved body.  When she shakes her heart-shaped ass to make the dress slide down her thighs I know life is good.  

She catches me staring and arches her eyebrows at me before she turns her back to zip it up.  Then it's makeup.  Her job makeup did not make her skin glow under club lights or frame her huge blue eyes with mysterious Egyptian stares.  It is sensible and subtle.  Makeup for a creature that walked beneath sunny blue skies rather than prowling through dark, smoky nightclubs.  

We were both trying.  I was not as sexy as Kym but I was laser focused on my tasks at hand.  I only cared about my thesis and the 3 finals coming up in my core classes.  I was surfing again at Ocean Beach and Kym was into yoga, dance classes and running through Golden Gate Park past all our junkie friends who waved cigarettes as she shot by like a deer.  

We had not kicked but we cut back on the heroin to the point where we used only on the weekends.  It was bullshit and we both cheated but our bodies glowed in the triumph of less use.  Less heroin, cocaine, junk food and alcohol.  But Jason...

Jason had nothing to care about.  He just drifted through the old routines and seemed baffled when we refused free bumps.  His habits were gaining momentum.  He was shooting heroin, cocaine and meth.  He was thinner and his thoughts more scattered than ever.  Like a demon faced wheel rolling off a cliff Jason gained an unholy momentum and only knew how to go deeper, faster...

But fuck Jason.  He stole our TV again, the Playstation, some rent money and worst of all - Kym's necklace.  The necklace pissed me off as material goods and money can be replaced but not this necklace.  It was an antique silver medallion made in Roman times.  It depicted the god Mithra who according to Kym was her family's ancient religion.  A god of light and truth stolen by a filthy, sneaky rat faced fuck of a human being.

I shrugged noncommittal as she combed her platinum blond hair.  To be honest and to put my high horse attitude in perspective- tonight was Friday and after classes I wanted to snort heroin.  Jason was the easiest to ask but alas, the little shit was gone.

After my physics study group I met Mike at the video store where he stared blankly at lesbian porn.  He nodded when I called his name.

""Yeah?"", he droned staring at porn.

""Any more Humboldt?""

""Yeah"", said Mike mechanically, eyes still on the lesbians.  He pulled out an 1/8th of weed and tossed it across the counter.  ""$45.""

Weed was expensive but Humboldt was mind expanding so I paid the man.  I was ready to leave when Mike said, ""The cactus is dried...want some?""

Mike's mom grew peyote in Santa Barbara.  Lately I got a lot of psychedelics from Mike.  I nodded.  Mike fished out a hunk of what looked like a shriveled jalapeño slice.

""Careful.  It's pretty good...""

I should have listened.  After I puked up my falafel dinner the intensity set in.  Not just colors going vibrant or sliding walls but reality became heavily distorted.  The demons on the bus coming from work knew I was on to them.  They were planning to get me.  The writing on the bus windows said Hitler, Flowers, Inca, Doom.  I picked up a discarded newspaper.  It was folded to a local story where a homeless guy was found tied to a tree in Golden Gate Park with his throat slit...Ok, I am tripping hard.  Relax...I stare out the window as the blocks rolled by.

My city is so beautiful.  As Victorian houses tumbled past fog enshrouded gothic temples we approached the park.  The same park where the guy was found tied to a tree.  I stood up and yelled, ""Let me off this fucking bus!""

The trees swayed and waved giant hands to the night sky as I scurried like a thief through the park.  My heart was pounding but I knew it was the peyote.  I needed to relax...like heroin relax.  My old routines took me to the fountains where I knew I could find dealers.  As I approached a smoky crowd of ganja smoking hippy street kids Melo materialized towards me.

""Hey!  Kym was here looking for you...didn't you hear man?"", said Melo.  Behind Melo was his tiny girlfriend Dev wrapped in enormous wool sweaters.  Her eyes drilled  into my soul.  Fuck.  Dev knew...

""Hear what?""

""Jason.  He OD'd.  At the Powell St. BART station.  Looks like he was robbed or something"", said Melo.  

Dev walked up still staring at me.

""I told you!  I told all of you!"", she pointed at me.

""Honey please not now"", hushed Melo.

""They tried to drown him!"", she said as her eyes widened.  Dev's head kept changing.  Feathers and scales grew to cover her face as her eyes bulged like pupils staring through goldfish bowls.

My roommate was in a hospital somewhere.  My girlfriend was wandering around Golden Gate Park at night trying to find me.  And here I am.  Tripping out on the Viking runes sliding forth from the foggy city skies...

""Melo"", I said in a moment of clarity, ""Do you have any powder?  No tar.  Powder.""

Dev turned and stalked off in disgust.  Melo looked taken aback too but why?  For Jason?  Fuck Jason.  

""Naw"", shrugged Melo.  ""I only have Caesar's black tar...but the Vietnamese guys aren't the only ones with the powder.""

""Who else?"", I asked but felt her staring again.  Dev stood in the glow of a park light pointing at Melo.

""Don't!  Don't you dare!"", she said.

Melo looked pissed and walked off.  I followed him.

""He's one of them!"", she shrieked as we walked off.

""She's tripping hard lately.  Says she sees shit you know?  People won't hang with us anymore because...never mind"", Melo grimaced shaking his head.  ""Anyways down this path is Gino.  He has good powder.  But...Dev will flip so you go ahead.  Maybe remember me later?""

I nodded and walked down the path.  The park lights were beacons of civilization. Nestled between two lights was a bench with a man sitting in the shadows.

He was staring at me.  His face was pale and bloated like a drunk and his eyes shimmered like moonlight on water.  I saw him in waves and knew I was still tripping hard.  Now I wanted to stop.  This was the fast way.  I walked up to him.

""Gino?"", I asked.  The man nodded.  ""Melo told me...well you got any bags?""

""I can help you"", the man whispered and I shivered.  His voice wheezed and creaked like air being forced through the wrong pipes.  

I bought two bags.  In my haze I saw green fairy light patterns flow from his hands like glowing runes from sacred texts.  They were not powder.  It was more tar.

""Oh.  I thought you had powder..."", I said.

""I do"", wheezed Gino who sat as still as a rock in the moonlight.  Then he was standing.  Then he was moving.  I was seeing things in choppy flashes.  ""Follow me...""

Gino walked off the lit path into a grove of swaying trees.  I stopped on the path and stood in light.  My heart was pounding.  I could see moving shadows circling in the grove.

""I don't carry it all...come here"", commanded Gino's voice from the darkness.  

I want heroin.  I want it so bad.  This life, the pain the hassle and the cold funeral chill when you have no more...I took one step into darkness.

And she started screaming.  A hideously high pitched child's scream.  Sexless and piercing.  I ran back to the light.  

Dev was flopping around on the ground and Melo was holding her.  Some kind of fit.  She puked a slick red stream of sour smelling liquid.  It looked like blood.

""Ugh.  It's box wine"", said Melo looking up.  ""She's wasted man.  C'mon Dev.  We gotta get you up.""

Dev was pale and ghastly white in the park light.  Her lips looked like purple rubies and dripped vomit.  

""I told you not to go there.  They will consume you..."", whispered Dev.  ""Drowned Boys.  Walk the city.  At night.""

Poor Melo.  I have had some interesting girlfriends but this man is a Saint.  Dev is crazy.  Street crazy.  Paints the walls with her own blood crazy...which is why Kym won't let her in our place anymore.

""I will protect you"", says Dev in her faraway little girl whisper.

The ground rolls under my feet as the peyote still has me in its grip. The trees bend towards us as if to listen to Dev.  I watch trees bow towards her tiny form as she stares upwards...Thin arms stretched toward a black sky.  Fuck this.

I excuse myself from the madness and stumble towards the street.  I walk along the avenue that borders the park.  Half city and half nature.  I don't believe in Heaven so I think of crossing the street when light washes over me.  In the intensity of the beam I see modern age demons made of glass dancing and then...a deafening HONK!  I freeze as the sound tears through me like a shotgun blast.

""Hey!  There you are!""

I shield my face and turn away.  Something weird is happening.

""Hey!  Babe!  What the fuck is wrong with you?""

I look up.  Jesus.  It's Kym.  

""Get in!"", she commands so I enter.  I stare at her like a freak.

""Fuck.  What are you on?""

""Peyote.""

""Great.  You know we're going to the hospital right?  Man I don't need this shit"", says Kym lighting a cigarette as she stomps on the gas and wheels away.

So much starlight in the car.  The dashboard is like a 3D map of the galaxy...I think I say this out loud because Kym gives me an amused smile.  I pull out the heroin.

""I, I...Kym I need this.  Need.  Now."" I hold up the bags.

In the parking lot of the hospital we smoke some heroin from a lightbulb Kym had stashed in her car.  My face is stretched to a new dimension in the bulb reflection...

""Best way to smoke tar..."", says Kym sucking in the vinegar smoke.

""Yeah..."", I agree.  I feel EVERYTHING in the universe.

""This is messed up"", chokes Kym.  ""Jason OD'd and we're fucking smoking out of a lightbulb in the hospital parking lot!""

I want to say something nice but I'm gone.  I watch a cartoon sky pulse and tear apart.  From the rip in the sky falls gummy lobsters bright, colorful and shiny...

""Babe lets go see him"", says Kym pulling on my jacket, ""C'mon...Fuck I can't stand up!""

But I can.

""Wait here.  I'll go get Jason"", I say and stumble towards the hospital building.  

Weird red lights race around the sky like fireballs.  I enter the temple of light and walk to a desk.  The angel in the castle turret stares at me.

""Where are you going my man?"", asks the angel pleasantly.

""Jason Rusca"", I say.

""Rusca?  Hmmmm"", says this being of light but another spirit besides it speaks to me.

""The OD boy?  He's right there man.  Hurry before visiting hours end.  You got 8 minutes.""

Ah the 8 fold path, I muse walking towards the room.  Inside is Jason.  Two black eyes, a cut on his head and his foot is elevated and wrapped like a mummy.

""Dude!"", he grins.  

""I have come to visit you"", I announce solemnly.

Jason stares at me for a second and then starts laughing.

""Fuuuuck me!  What are you on man?""

I shrug.  It would take too long to explain.

""Look dude"", says Jason, ""in the closet is my jacket.  Check the inside pocket with the zipper.""

I obey and unzip the jacket.  Inside I feel tobacco crumbs, coins and a slithery chain which I pull out.  It is Kym's necklace.  My eyes widen.  I look upon the face of Kym's old god.  He is a stern deity and appears to be slitting the throat of a bull.

""Tell Kym I'm sorry ok?  Yeah I sold it but I got it back today.  But the price...well thats why I'm here man!"", laughs Jason wiggling his wrapped foot.

""What?""  

""Never mind dude but thanks for coming OK?"", says Jason.

""I am really fucked up"", I announce holding the chain.

""Yeah don't rub it in"", says Jason holding up a button that he starts clicking over and over.  ""This is supposed to be morphine.  Sometimes it works but mostly I just click the fucking thing...""

""I must leave now Jason Rusca.""

""Ok.  Sure.  Hey don't eat all my strawberry Pop Tarts ok?""

""Yes Jason Rusca.  Good bye.""

""FuckinA!"", laughs Jason as I leave.

It takes me forever to find Kym's car but I do.  I go inside.  Kym is nodded out so I caress the purple hair out of her eyes and crawl in besides her.  She wakes up for a second annoyed, sees its just me and melts into my embrace.

""Is he alive?"", asks Kym.

""Yes.""

""Thank goodness"", yawns Kym.  

I hang her ancient necklace from the rearview mirror so she will see it when she awakes.  And I pass out on this tiny uncomfortable carseat.  

Fuck Jason. ",1431056831.0

I didn't miss the vein, I know whats that like (highly local swelling occurring instantaneously), but about 30 seconds after the injection what looks like an allergic reaction began to occur near the injection site. It looks kind of like when you rub against poison ivy for a second (right after it happens, not once it gets worse). Its still there, the swelling has stopped. It used to be pink and warm, now its just like a small plateau on my skin. Has only been about 10 minutes since then. It looked something like this:  http://www.thecambodiaherald.com/images/upload/health/OWQyMjEwMWM3YjRhYTQzZmIxM2FjMDEyM2NiYWY4/760_450/Allergies%20eruption%20on%20skin.jpg, but without the pink color.

No other allergic symptoms were experienced so I'm wondering if there is anything other than an allergic response that can do that.

Just wondering if this normal for some heroin injections. Its been so long since I tried heroin that I don't even remember now. Its very clear to me that this is low quality stuff and I OBVIOUSLY shouldn't be doing heroin in the first place, but aside from that, is there anything I should be specifically concerned about based off this reaction? More importantly, now that the deed is done (and the 0.1g of heroin gone with none remaining), is there anything I can do as far as preventative medicine goes to reduce the risk of an infection? Antibiotics, etc?

357vax,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/357vax/tianeptine_my_opinion/,3,https://redd.it/357vax,indalcecio,Tianeptine - my opinion,"So I got some tianeptine after basically getting scammed when trying to get some acetylfentanyl. I got a gram of it, which isn't a whole lot.

I certainly have an opiate tolerance, I can go through an awful lot of dope on a good run, but currently it's lower than it's been in a while, I think a point of decent dope IV would get me pretty high.

So I decided what the hell I'll give it a shot. The main thing I want to emphasize is that it was DEFINITELY a full-on opioid. It feels kind of weird, hard to describe, a bit of a head fog and also muscle tenseness, and not a whole lot of a rush. The rush is less euphoria than just feeling a bit dizzy and feeling it hit all at once.

It doesn't last very long so if you're going to be shooting it make sure you have plenty of BRAND NEW rigs, because you'll be doing a shot every 5 hours at least if you want to stay comfortable.

But yeah, it definitely keeps me out of opioid withdrawal completely, and does give an opioid buzz. Given the fact that it's pretty cheap, I would recommend it to people who can't get anything else and just HAVE to feel that opioid high every now and then. Not very good as a main opioid if you have a habit, but again it's cheap so you could just buy a bunch.
 
I would NOT recommend IV'ing it. It's possible, but this shit BURNS really bad if you miss even a little, it's awful and it takes a while to go away, like a day or so. I definitely don't believe this is safe to IV long term and won't be doing so if I ever get more. If you choose to, though, make sure you have fresh rigs, again.

I used a pretty large amount, probably 1-200 mg each time, because I have an opioid tolerance, but obviously I'd recommend starting small. 

edit: one last thing. When IV'ing it, it has the strangest side effect - your asshole gets really warm. At first I kept checking to make sure I didn't accidentally shit myself. I have no idea why this happens or if it's just me, but it goes away after a couple seconds, so whatever I guess. Anyone else have experience with this?",1431032360.0

By easily affected, I mean constipated. It began with a doctor's visit in which a complaint I had regarding abdominal pain led to the assessment that I was blocked up and should take mag. citrate (a heavy-duty laxative) to flush my system. Nearly a month after the visit and ingestion of some norcos, I suffered what I believe to be an impacted stool, spending an entire day in what I imagine is comparable only to labor. After having given up on natural methods of removal, I drank the mag. citrate and was able to force out the blockage, but the experience scarred me. I vowed to never touch opiates again. I of course abandoned this promise and have continued to dabble, but not without ever experiencing constipation and hyperawareness of my bowel habits. It has nearly made the experience unenjoyable, but I suppose if there is any clear indication of addiction, it would be my willingness to consciously sacrifice my health. I have taken precautionary methods to avoid another impaction by using stool softeners when binging, as well as miralax, both of which were recommended to me to take if I ever were to use opiates by several doctors. (On a side-note, I guess many doctors claim that miralax can be safely taken daily, but I question the safety of using a stimulant laxative daily). I also stay hydrated, but the process by which I binge opiates (and now light laxatives) has seemed to have a rather disastrous effect on my GI system. When not using, I produce no solids.Perhaps I need a month or more of abstinence from opiates (and laxatives) to truly gauge the state of my system, but it seems damaged (at least temporarily so) in part because of my abuse of opiates in conjunction with laxatives. Has anyone had a similar experience? How was I able to go 3 years without ever having a noticeable issue? I realize one can develop a dependency to laxatives, which would truly be an awful byproduct of my use. This is clearly more of a medical concern and I am not asking for a medical diagnosis or remedy, I am merely just curious as to how much of an issue this is in the opiate-using community. I realize constipation is a well-known side-effect of using opiates in any fashion, but I seem to be more easily affected than others (although only recently). I've had unrelated GI issues in the past and wonder if I am predisposed to reacting with much greater ease to this particular grotesque aspect of opiate use, yet wonder why I had not noticed these effects during my 3+ years of abuse. Like many of us, I can overlook long-term damage for short-term pleasure, but when the consequences are so clear and imminent, I actually give pause. Why is this issue not discussed more? How do others handle this terrible side-effect? I merely binge, I imagine my body wouldn't even allow for daily use and wonder how daily use is even possible. Also, the CNS depression opiates cause is so severe, it can even make pissing impossible. I've nodded out on the toilet for hours without releasing a drop. I imagine these are just the most obvious ways my system is slowed down and bodily processes are disrupted by opiates depressing effects. The more I consider how clearly damaging persistent opiate use is to my body, the more I feel inclined to quit. I'll likely try a month of abstaining from use, while eating healthily, exercising, hydrating, and see if I return to a healthy state of release. I'll see a GI specialist if my system appears to be totally fucked.",1431185845.0

So I woke up sick as all fuck only 24 hrs into WDs. I have money, but lately no dope is around unless I want to pay $40 for a ""Half bun"" of some bunk ass fent ridden dope.. Which comes in little bags that literally consist of a fucking tiny line per bag.. Yes ONE TINY FUCKING LINE PER BAG and it's a hit or miss one bag will literally have a half g a day user falling over crying about to puke their intestines up and another bag will just barely take away your sickness. SO first thing in the morning I don't even hit that girl up for that loose unstamped bullshit dope thinking oh I'll just hit up my normal plug and go out to the projects and cop some fire 20 bags!

So on to the fuckfest. I hit up that plug with the finally stamps... Says ""yeah it'll be a little I'll hit you up"" that was at 9am. Turns out I sit in my car in the small town next to his waiting on his call from 9 am to 1pm with my car off in this blazing heat we have on the east coast already this early in May. Sweating balls with my friend in the passenger who shoots complaining the whole time about how sick he has been and how he hadn't slept the night before. Fuckin shit so no answer by 1 pm so we find this dude who says he can get us blues in the mean time. My friend hands me 25 bucks to throw down and he gets picked up by a friend who says he can get us dope about 30 min away but also has to go by a clinic after copping so he'll be a couple hours before he's back. So we both go out on our ""mission"" to get each other shit. Me on the hunt to grab the 2 beans and him on the hunt to grab a bundle of d. 

So I smoke a blunt waiting on the dude who is waiting on this lady to come into this town to drop off our beans, tryin to pass some time. Finally around 3 pm I get a call from him and told to go to the local diner. I sit at the diner which this kid lives 2 mins away from. Sit there for 20 min waiting and I get a call from my friend who's out on the hunt for d-- he said before he left that he was positive he was getting the D. Now he says over the phone that it was a shit show and he couldn't get anything it was a waste of time and a long ass drive out to the clinic way far out of town. He says he's coming back and he will come right to the diner.. 10 min later he shows up at the diner mind you the dude who was supposed to come with the blues STILL HASNT SHOWED. My friend gets in the passenger and brings out a stem and a few 20s of crack. Begins to smoke pack after pack of some fire hard right in front of me.. I have never done hard before and just because I do heroin doesn't mean I want to try hard but he keeps on trying to convince me to try it which I do not. He begins to get extremely anxious even more than before yelling what the fuck this whole day has been a shit show!! I agree and then the blue kid finally walks up and gets in my whip; says that we have to sit longer and wait on the lady to come drop off the blues. About 45 min later sitting there he asks for a few whacks of some hard my friend gives him a couple fat packs and then the blue kid gets a call on his phone and says he has to go 2 min away and get the blues from her as she is pulling in his driveway. He gets out and we hand him $60 for the beans he goes on his way.. He calls me and says hey she just picks me up and we have to go get the beans 20 min away so go get off this exit and sit at the Burger King right off the exit. What the fuck man so we go there sit at Burger King. An hour goes by and my friends phone is dead so we drive back to his town to charge his phone so we can see if our D Boy has said anything back. Sure enough he says come through so we drive all the way out to the projects get our D FINALLY!!! At 7 pm!!!! And the blue guy just never calls back. We are beat for our $60 on the blues at this point.

I waited from 9 am to 7 pm in my car driving around and sitting around all fucking day sick as balls when it was a beautiful day out I could have and should have been enjoying my day but nope people have to be fucking unreliable.. I thought the dope game was easier than the pill game and I was right but damn it's still tough. Long ass rant and jumbled story but shit I thought you guys would find this interesting or at least relate to my day from hell in some way.

Being a sufferer of fibromyalgia I decided I needed to get high in order to be able to stand/sit outside for the 4-6 hours the yard sale would be lasting. Before my brother and I went outside to set up, I took 10 of my 300mg Gabapentin. During the length of the yard sale I was feeling pretty damn good. Colors were more vivid and I wasn't in much pain. The brofessor managed to sell his drumset for 300 bucks but that was all we sold. Lame. Close to the end of the yard sale my aunt and cousin show up as we are supposed to be celebrating my mother's birthday tonight. While we are all inside talking and catching up the conversation eventually steers to my best friend Mike, who is my first and best friend since first grade, the only person in the world I feel comfortable telling absolutely everything to, and the only person that doesn't judge me for my drug use's recent diagnosis of Marfan Syndrome. Most people diagnosed with Marfan Syndrome don't live past 35-40, so he has already lived over half his life already. Needless to say, this made me sad. Really fucking sad. So sad I cried - and I never cry. After the conversation is over I go to where my prescriptions are stored and take 400mg of Tramadol and 3 Tylenol 3s (30mg codeine and 375mg acetaminophen I think). Looking back now I realize using drugs during a bout of depression is a stupid fucking idea. At least for me it is. The two days prior I had also taken 400mg of Tramadol. Important information right there. I go back out to my family and start playing FFVII while talking to the fam. 30 minutes later my legs start twitching pretty damn bad. I find this weird but don't think much of it. Next thing I know I'm waking up on the floor with EMTs inside the house loading me up onto a stretcher. Apparently I have had a seizure. For the next two days I am stuck in the hospital. During my stay my muscles are rigid stiff and I keep getting splitting god-fucking-awful migraines. On the second day I have to talk to some dolt of a psychiatrist who thinks I was trying to kill myself and won't accept any other explanation. I was trying to get fucking high goddamn! So he says I have to go to a crisis center when I get discharged. I remembered a conversation I had before with my counselor about a facility where they only hold you for 23 hours so I pick that place of course. The next day I am discharged. I ask to go home first for a bit for a smoke and because I'm homesick, but my family says no and takes me straight to the facility. At the facility I am branded an addict and the assholes running the place refuse to accept the fact that I have fibromyalgia, so I have to go without my fibro meds for yet another day. Great. Before going home the people working there suggest I go to detox but I'm like fuck that I'm homesick let me go home. When I get home I find all my meds - including the non-narcotic ones - have been hidden so more pain for me yay. Now it has been 4 days since I have been home and I want to die. I wish that fucking seizure had killed me. I can't get any painkillers. I can't even get my gabapentin. So today I'm going to see Mike and some other people and I'm trying to find some painkillers.

His dose is 115mg and he has been on it for about 4 months. I didn't know about his addiction until after we started dating but I want to help him through this. My problem is that we always get into arguments over really small things and he freaks out over things and blames me for them. He seems extremely irritable and he loses his temper very quickly. In some of these bad moods he says really hurtful things to me and he makes me cry. I will admit that I am sensitive but these things are over the top like telling me that I ruined his life and that he hates me. Then later he will tell me that I mean the world to him and he loves having me around. I love him and I want to help him but I can't take the way he is when he is mad. Basically I am wondering if these issues are related at all to the drugs or if they are maybe underlying issues that just never appeared until now. Any advice on how to best support him through this time is also appreciated.

Anyway, I started a new job at a manager at a restaurant at the beach. It's my dream job, I have been in the industry for almost 10 years and I have wanted to move up from serving. When I first started, I was so happy to find a place where everyone was so welcoming and helpful. I should have known everything was too good to be true.

At some point between when I started and last week, I mentioned to someone, don't remember who, that I have a Xanax prescription. Two weeks ago, the dishwasher found an empty stamp (surprisingly not mine) in the toilet. Being the little narc he is, he told my gm and some other people. 

This spread around and I guess my Xanax prescription led some of the girls to think it was mine. I started noticing about 2 weeks ago that people were starting to act weird around me, being rude, and whispering to each other after I walked away. I noticed people making fun of the dope bag as I was walking by and basically just bullying me. 

Now, I would normally tell myself I was being paranoid but my gm, who is super cool and an ex opiate addict himself, told me that the girls were spreading rumors about me concerning the Xanax and the dope bag. This one girl on particular is on a vendetta to tell anyone who will listen that I'm a drug addict and no one should respect me. I find that when I tell these girls to do something, they smirk and ignore me.

Ok, I get it, technically she is right but my GM told me he doesn't believe I'm a drug addict and that even if I was, he doesn't care because I don't act high at work and I do my job well. I just find it ridiculous that this 27 year old girl is trying to bully me. We're not in high school anymore and a Xanax prescription is not a crime or indication of drug use. This bitch regularly brags about getting stoned but I'm a drug addict because I have a Xanax prescription?

Anyway, I'm just ranting but I was in tears today because a lot of coworkers that I used to be cool with barely say hi to me because this girl is telling everyone I'm a drug addict. The owners have been told and my GM is thinking that the only way to solve this is to sit both of us down and ""hash it out"". It's so fucking embarrassing! I make a point not to act high at work and I don't think I've taken one Xanax during my shift since I started. 

So basically fuck catty chicks, fuck narcs, and fuck fucking mob mentality. And thanks to anyone who actually read all this, you're awesome. ",1431144741.0

So I sit with Jason and mixed in little bumps of H with my cocaine.  I let these 2 pillars of heaven argue over my soul as I sit back and observe.  I realize I don't like people much.  I am pretty cut off from humanity.  As these cynical thoughts simmer in my skull I see her.  

Kym.  Man when the spirit is on her she dances with this overflowing light that radiates sexuality like a supernova.  People stare.  I am just starting to get used to living with a woman who turns heads.  Her new hair color is blonde and now they stare like goons.  Men and women constantly approach her as if they can't help themselves.  Like moths to her fire. 

And she picks me?  Madness. 

""Yeah she's smart and rich and beautiful.  Don't worry I'm sure you'll blow it someday"", remarked Jason cheerfully when I brought it up.

It is 1:45am on a Tuesday night in San Francisco, California.  The alcohol fueled madness of the night is reaching a fevered pitch inside the Lucky 13.  The DJ is playing the lowest common denominator drunk classics for the crowd.  REO Speedwagon is cranked to abnormally loud levels as a multitude of drunks from all walks of life scream along, ""...AND I MEANT -  EVERY WORD I SAID - WHEN I SAID THAT I LOVED YOU I MEANT THAT I LOVE YOU FOREVER!

And in the middle of this drunken maelstrom Kym whirls and dances and screams along into her beer bottle microphone, ""I DON'T WANNA SLEEP!  I JUST WANNA KEEP ON LOVIN' YOOOOU!"" and as the song ends she howls a YEAAAAH! and casually tosses the beer bottle over her shoulder as she walks back to the table.  I watch it sail over the dance floor and shatter against a wall raining shards and beer down on a table of corporate guys in suits.  They seem confused for a second and then go back to whatever they were doing.  I look at Jason.  His mouth is hanging open.  He slowly turns his head towards me.  

""Did you see that?""

""Yeah.""

""That was awesome!""

""Maybe we should get going"", I suggest looking around nervously.  But miraculously, no one seems to have noticed my girlfriend threw a Anchor Steam beer bottle across the room.  

""No man.  Give her more coke.  I want to see what she does next.""

Kym stalks up to the table like an apex predator and plants her hands on both sides and leans down towards me.  Her kisses include little playful bites and my lower lip is always sore.

""Last call boys"", she smiles wide and cat-like, ""Should we get another round or go?""

""Lets go"", I say quickly.

""Ok but I gotta stop by Lucky1 for smokes"", says Jason.

""And you"", says Kym grabbing my ass, ""need to get some supplies too.""

I could feel my face turning red...I look at Jason who is laughing.

""She means condoms man!""

Kym saunters towards the club door and Jason grabs me.

""Dude when you're banging later can me do me a favor?""

I look at him balefully.

""Make her say my name ok?  Make her say 'Jason! Oh Jason!'  C'mon man do me this favor!""

By the door Kym is arguing with two girls over some random thing and I sense a scene so I pull her and Jason out into the night air.

""Go back to the fucking suburbs bitch!"", screams Kym as we head across the street.

At Lucky1, the proprietor Arjun was wrestling a drunk old Mexican man out of his store.  The old man is so drunk he takes a wild swing at Arjun and falls over to the street.

""I am calling police!"", says Arjun as Kym and Jason walk past him into the store.  Arjun looks at me.

""How do you say 'I call police' in Spanish?""

""Uhm, let's see.  I think its Chinga tu madre"", I say.

""Chinga tu madre!"", says Arjun and the drunk old man stands up and gets into a boxing stance.

""Don't come back!"", says Arjun closing the door and peering outside.  ""Ah good.  He is leaving.  I hate these people type!""

Arjun is from India and runs the Lucky1 for a relative.  This 24 hour market is the soul of the neighborhood after 2am.  From high school kids shoulder tapping for beer to meeting your connection in the parking lot at 4:00am everyone loves the Lucky1.  Arjun fixes a display of donuts that was kicked over.  

Everything expensive is behind the counter including cigarettes and condoms.  Jason buys cigarettes and leaves.  When its my turn Arjun leans close to me and speaks.

""What is wrong with your wife?""

I look back and Kym is dressed head to toe in black with a black leather jacket and large black wrap around sunglasses.  She standing perfectly still with a blank expression on her face.

""Arjun I have no wife.""

""What?  Why wont you marry?""

""Who?""

""Her!""

""Can I have some condoms please?  The yellow box there"", I point.

""Oh ho!  You need lube?""

I look around wildly.  What the hell is wrong with everyone?

""No!  How much?""

""She is good woman.  Nice hips.  Blonde.  Good.  You see.  Good.""

""Thanks Arjun.""

I go outside with Kym.  Jason is there.

""Thanks for distracting him dude.  Check it out"", says Jason.  He opens his jacket and shows me 2 boxes of donuts.  Powdered and Chocolate.

""What the...What is wrong with you?"", I ask Jason as Kym helps herself to a powdered donut.

'What?  I paid for my smokes!"", says Jason indignantly.  

""I didn't"", says Kym as she flicks her wrist and a pack of Marlboro Lights drops out of her jacket sleeve into her hand.

I don't know if I have the willpower to throw it away.","Hi guys. I'm an opiate addict. I suffer from depression and anxiety. I have no social life. Opiates are my only friend really... but it's a black widow that eats me inside and leaves me feeling like shit. I have been using for about 3-4 years via insufflation or smoked. Never IVed although I've thought about it many times as needles are legal in my states. I was clean for over an entire year for some reason. During that phase, I was not happy, but the suboxone helped. The honeymoon phase of buprenorphine has ended however and I only take it to not feel lethargic and give me energy/not be in withdrawal... 

 I relapsed out of boredom in late 2014. I've been to rehab once and detox three times. I relapsed after each one usually the day discharged... (but this was 2-3 years ago). After the initial relapse in late 2014, my cravings grew more and more and I have had a dozen or so more relapses since then. I would use everyday then run out then go back on my suboxone... it was not a good cycle. So far though I've been clean for 2-3 weeks...

I was getting randomly drug screened for a while a few months ago, and the addict in me decided to go through fentanyl and fentanyl analogues since they weren't on my specific drug screen. This was a horrible decision, it was so short-acting compared to my DOC (Heroin) that I went through so much and my tolerance skyrocketed insanely. I wish I never touched them, the worst part was I didn't get drug screened during the time I did this shit... so I could of just done dope and had a better time... fuck even suboxone would of been better than the fent (it's not very euphoric). I am on sub maintenance, and when I ran out I needed to take sufficiently more sub to feel better. 

I am in my early twenties and haven't even had a girlfriend or found myself yet. Opiates are a tool for me to numb myself and escape from reality. I've tried most except crack and meth but opiates were my DOC ever since trying oxycontin. I dunno what to do. I've thrown out heroin before, but don't know if I'll be able to this time. 

I've been past the worst of the w/d (my last relapse and withdrawal was the worst!) and the sub is holding me pretty well... it's just that I don't know.. I already sort of paid my guy to get some for me and I don't want to be weird and say no.. fuck man. I just wish I had something else to fill the void opiates have left.

So I searched on here and found this guide from about a year ago, so I thought I'd repost it hoping that somebody else will be able to use this method and stay away from being sick.

All credit to /u/ascan_nerdarkly - Thanks for writing this out!

""
Grab a clean rig and take the plunger out. Pack the rig with ya cottons and use the plunger to push them right down the bottom. Next squirt however much water down the barrel to cover them all and then put the plunger back in the rig. Let the water absorb into the cottons and then just push the plunger down and the water with the goodies in it will come straight out. Make sure you have a spoon ready to squirt the goodness into and be careful when you put the plunger back into the rig that it doesn't displace the water in there. I always filtered the remaining solution even though it was virtually clear just to be sure.
The most important thing to do is to make sure your cottons are completely dry before you put them into a container/baggie etc. Id always leave them in a open air spot for about a day to dry but be careful of dust n shit.
I found this method to be the most efficient at squeezing every last drop out and never once got cotton fever. I'm actually suprised noone else has mentioned this method yet =S""",1431273286.0

The original charge, which they would be able to see in this case is for 'possession of a designer drug'. It was methadone. I am NOT fucking admitting to that shit. Everyone says be honest, but I don't think they can see beyond the charge. So - what's the most innocuous designer drug I can admit to? I was thinking of saying it was just really good weed which can be considered as a designer drug. Thanks alls. ",1431270737.0

One of those golden moments where deals are forged!  We just gotta push a little harder team! Snyder?""

""Ok David"", said the sycophant known as Pete Snyder, ""I have Jill in engineering shopping the new specs but no one can commit to the cuts...""

I stare at them.  I hate them.  I wish I was anywhere but here.  Traveling with coworkers has pushed me to the brink of a psychotic breakdown.  Pete cannot call Dave Dave because he is too low on the totem pole.  So he calls him David.  This annoys me.  

Dave addresses us as 'Men' because he once did a team building exercise with an ex US Army Captain.  Now he feels that being in charge of a sales division equates him to the poor bastards that live, die and bleed for us overseas in foreign wars.  

Cunt.  Pus.

Fuck him.  If I have to sit through another one of his pep talks about why we are better than the other purple assed baboons screaming in the forest I will lose my fucking shit.  We come from nothing and shall return to nothing.  NOTHING.  

And he won't shut the fuck up:

""We have 2 days max to ramp up our deal pot.  Sweeten it.  I'll run interference on Jim and his team but we are pushing specs gentlemen.   Engineering will push back.  I know Jill and she is a cagey one.  We need someone to sign off on those cuts ASAP.  Men!  Whats the ETA on the push team's effort?  Dylan!  I need a frontline commitment to swing these guns...""

I understand the banter and it takes every ounce of self control not to smash my ice tea glass against Dave's skull.  Las Vegas is a paradise to these fools.  They drink, gamble, pretend to be big men spending company credit on expensive dinners and ""strategizing"" at all night drinking parties with willowy Korean girls at hostess bars.  

Being married I have a perfect excuse to not join in.  This doesn't stop most of the team.  But marriage to my wife is not keeping me on the straight and narrow path.  Nope.  It's drugs.  These pills allow me to sit in an Alaskan themed lodge swilling century old liquors with people I loathe as they play Keno and lie to each other.  These pills allow me keep a neutral expression as my colleagues collaborate at breakfast trying to figure out ways to disguise whoring on expense reports....These pills keep me from going to the gun trade show downstairs, buying a Glock 22 and putting holes in you meat bag soulless pieces of shit...Ahhhh but I digress.  

And I am running out.  Running out of time and pills.

This business trip was supposed to be 3 days and 2 nights.  The debauchery and promise of a new deal has created 2 more nights and now...?  Talk of a third?  My days are measured in pills.  2 pills equals 4 hours MAX.  It should be 3 pills but I must conserve.  At 2 pills I am no longer high.  It merely holds back the demons and pushes away the coffin cold crushing vice grip of withdrawal...

I do my presentation for the executive buyers.  I rush it.  But in front of people my Mask does the work.  I smile, assure them and SELL like a motherfucker.  I sit down, sip my ice tea and close my eyes for a second to feel the euphoria lick my brain...and open them to Dave.

Dave is fucking up.  He is obviously hungover and tripping over his spiel.  I don't think he knows jack shit about what we are trying to do.  He is assuring without understanding.  The other side of the table senses this too.  Fuck.  No more.  I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE ANYMORE!  

I clear my throat.

""Dave?  Sorry to do this now but we went with your recommendation...Yeah just heard it over the wire"", I smile benignly hoping he has enough brain left to catch on.  

All eyes are on me and my Mask.

""The...?"", fumbles Dave.

""You know.  Your schematics on the cuts?  All taken care of.  I just went over it with Jill.  You mind if I...?"" I gesture vaguely at the table.

I offer Dave dignity.

""Go ahead.  I must have missed it while on the conference call.."", he says professionally.  Fucking Harvard piece of shit.  

""Ok thanks Dave.  Gentlemen what we are trying to accomplish is this -""

After 10 minutes I am humming with power.  Dave has acknowledged my Save and the team is relieved.  I look polished and professional.  But in reality I am running out of opiates and want to go home.

We celebrate that night.  More debauchery at a nice Japanese steak house.  My plane tickets are confirmed.  I'm packed.  I am happy again.  I take my medicine in the restroom with a SNORT.  Ahh.  Wasteful but my favorite delivery method...Straight to the old brain.  Bypasses the steak and sashimi in my gut. 

The team splits up for the last night.  They go out into the neon beast and sacrifice the only thing that is sacred in Vegas.  Money.   And I go back to my room.  My message light blinks.  I sigh.  Probably more bullshit.  I push PLAY.

""Hey handsome I lost your celly but have a good memory for room numbers..."", giggles the escort I met 2 nights ago, ""But I came through.  Still down?  Call me at...""

I write down the number.  Hmm.  Charlotte was the second prostitute I had in my room since my arrival in Vegas.  The first one was Hanna and she was one freaky, sketchy bitch.  From Hanna I discovered Vegas is a METH town.  I gave her $75 just to leave.  No way I wanted anything to do with the scabs and sores on her.  

But Charlotte...Stripper from New Mexico that works trade show seasons in Vegas.  A mother of twins and poppy fan.  Same flavor as me so we get along.  I paid her $275 for 10 Roxi 30s.  She wanted $300 but I pointed out you want $25 or do you want to do Roxis with me?  We did some bumps and become buddies.  I bought her some cocktails downstairs on my corporate card.  Business baby.

Now she has half bags of brown powder for $100.  These bags were taxed and skinny but I had no scale nor options.  

Charlotte says she is a African American, Native American, Irish and Mexican.  She looks like a cocoa skinned, pug nosed, freckly brunette with huge tits to me.  I ignore her life story.  She doesn't ask mine.  We both seem relieved to know I will not be paying for sex. 

""Don't take this the wrong way but I just want to get high"", I tell her while chopping up lines with my room card.   

""Good because I slept funny last night.  My neck is killing me"", said Charlotte watching me work.

I snorted a few bumps and shared.  I kept my pills in my case for the ride home.  We watched pig races on TV.  

""I made a $1000 off a pig once"", smiled Charlotte dreamily.

I was getting high enough not to answer these strange missives from the Universe.  So I smiled instead.  Good brown.  

Charlotte added a joint and we smoked some subpar weed.  She busted out a second one and was looking for her lighter when I became inspired.

""Let's load some H in that shitty weed.""

Charlotte handed me the joint when a KNOCK KNOCK! came upon my door.

My room reeked of weed.  I was high on heroin.  I was watching pig races with a prostitute from New Mexico.  So I opened the door.  

It was Dave.

""Hey man thanks for the save bro!"", said Dave giving me an awkward handshake that involved some finger clasping I missed out on for I am older than 40 years of age. 

""No problem Dave.  Just trying to wrap this up...""  

My mask was not on.  And I don't think I could reach it from my towering vantage point.  But Dave was shitty drunk.  He did not seem to notice the ganja smoke swirling out into the hallway.  Behind me I could hear Charlotte putting drugs away in hotel drawers.

""Ohhh"", smiled Dave peering in, ""I didn't know you had company!""

I blinked as I tried to come up with...with something.  Anything.  But Charlotte covered.

""My name is Samantha.  I do 5 point deep tissue massage.  $150 for 20 minutes.  Interested sir?""

""Naw.  I'm good"", smiled Dave.  ""But seriously bro...Thanks.  Thanks!  I owe you man.  Big time.""
  
He winked and left.  Bastard.

Charlotte and I got almost nodded out high but not quite.  We could still stumble around the room for beverages and snacks.  I put all my stuff in the hotel safe just in case but I felt safe with Charlotte.  I had room service bring us up grilled cheese with tomatoes, curly fries and a turkey club with avocado.  

Around 2:30am Charlotte asked if her friend could come over?  She was working next hotel over as a cocktail waitress.  I said Sure.  My suite is huge and I am high.  The more the merrier.

Manda showed up around 3am and ate my fries and raided the hotel bar.  She wasn't into heroin.  Manda was a pixie redhead wearing a toga from her job next door at Caesar's.  We were smoking another joint and watching Caddy Shack when someone KNOCK KNOCK'd upon my door.

My room reeked of weed.  I was high on heroin.  I was hanging out with a prostitute from New Mexico, a pixie redhead wearing a toga, we are watching Caddy Shack and eating curly fries.  So I open the door.  It was Beth from Marketing.  

Wait.  What?

And now here is Beth.  A chubby blond with 3 kids, great husband named Stan who did the brakes on my truck for FREE.  My brain did cartwheels trying to piece together WHY Beth from Marketing would knock knock on my door at 3:30am?  My brain failed me.  Weakling.

""Ohhh fuck I'm sorry I just thought, you know how we like...?"", mumbles Beth.

She was hammered and holding my door frame to maintain upright.  Beth was wobbly eyed and looked inside my suite.  The girl in the toga waved cheerfully but Charlotte was too busy watching Caddy Shack and smoking a joint.

""I just...I just..."", said Beth and then she started to do this weird hiccup drunken boo hoo hoo cry.  

I don't need this but man I am high.  Manda picked up on Beth right away and came over.

""Heeeey...Are you ok sweety?"", she asked rubbing Beth's back and guiding her into my suite to the couch where we were doing drugs.  

I thought of leaving.  Vegas is open 24/7.  But this is my room.  Beth is my coworker.  All these strange women, their highs, their lows and tears.  All on me.  

So I called a meeting.  Charlotte nodded out but I could count on Manda.  We walked Beth home 2 floors down.  Her roommate Sheila the new Marketing Associate Director was passed out on her bed wearing really cool underpants.  Her panties were white but had a angry panda bellowing from her crotch.  

We put Beth on her bed, covered her up and left.  Manda was a Las Vegas pro.  Like she helped strangers put their coworkers back into their rooms all the time.  We hugged goodbye before she helped Charlotte into the cab.  As they pulled away I looked at my watch.  4:38am.  The sun would catch up with me soon.  I was high.  But professionally so.  From that half gram I had a bump waiting and one upon waking up at 10:00am.  I'd hit it before 11:30am checkout.  I'll keep 3 pills in my pocket.  Swallow 2 before I get on the plane.  Snort the last one 1.5 hours into the flight to glide home opiate happy and sane.  

And when I get home...I can FINALLY get high.       ",1431240761.0

I am 21 but still on my families insurance plan, and I made the mistake of giving them buy insurance information.  I know that if they file this on my insurance it will come back to my family and destroy them.  My mother tends toward depression and I can only imagine what this will do to her.  There is no way to explain casual use of black tar heroin.

If my bill is at all within my power to handle I want to set up a payment plan and have them not file insurance.  Will it be to late for this on Monday?

Whats the best surprise find you've ever had?,"Most of you probably know the euphoric feeling that happens when you find a little stash/stray pill/etc, that you didn't know was there and weren't looking for. So I wanted to hear everyone's best finds! 

Just the other day I had one of the two best finds in my life.  The other day I was just about out of my current batch of Roxi's (and wouldn't be able to get any more for a couple weeks) when I went into my room to randomly look for a iPhone charger (that I almost certainly didn't have in there) for some unknown reason.  My room was a disaster after a few big parties and general procrastination of cleaning, and I quickly gave up after my roommate yelled he had one  I could use.  

As Im walking out, I stepped on a piece of bubble wrap, which scared the living shit out of me. I looked down, and noticed a little green pill poking out from underneath my dresser.  I pick it up and sure enough its an A 214!  I decided to move the dresser and couldn't believe my eyes when I found a baggie of 17 more of those guys!  They had to have been there from at least over a year ago - certainly nothing I remember.  It was probably the best day of my life haha. 

For the record, my other find was like 6 years ago when I went to a relatives house and was watching tv in the basement family/Tv room.  I saw a bucket of some pill bottles and took a peek - sure enough I found a GIANT bottle of about 100 norco and probably 40 percs.  I had actually recently broken my hand so I just asked my relative (who in retrospect was clearly very naive when it comes to opiates) if I could have a couple.  She said she got them from a prior surgery but they made her sick so she hates them and I could take em.  Boy was that a good one haha

Participants attend a once a week recovery group led by the doctor/provider and a mental health therapist.  The group members appear to value having a therapeutic relationship with a caring doctor,  who truly knows them as individuals. 3 groups per month are required.

I'm new in town and I'm also completely dry. I don't know anyone here, except for some non-users I met at University. There's a sort of ambulance around here where methadone is handed out, even when the place is not open. I plan to just go there tomorrow before noon and try to chat up some of the people waiting outside, maybe I'll end up getting a number for a connect or something. 

This is not the hood, I've already staked the place out. There's two doctor's office nearby. There won't be any doctors present either, on the weekends they only hand out meds to the addicts so it should be low risk. 

So I conclude the chances of me getting jumped right there on the spot are very low. I have some questions though:

Should I cop right there? I'd have to take the bus home and I don't know if that's smart with pills/dope burning a hole in my pocket.
Is there any way to break the ice? I'm only 21 so I don't think I'll be taken for a cop but I do expect the users being a bit skeptical of others.
What if someone offers me to tag along? I picked Sunday since a) clinic's not open so I'm less likely to be chased of the property and b) it's not that busy so perhaps less cops on patrol. This could bite me in the ass though because it would make it easier to just take me to some secluded place and worst case rob me.

I get prescribed 180 10mg Oxymorphone a month, and they just weren't helping my pain when taken orally. I then tried to snort them during my flare-ups, and I would puke 80% of the time. Even then, the pills weren't helping me. I would land in the E.R. multiple times a month for them to give me .5 Hydromorphone (which honestly felt like a slap in the face since they could see that .5 did NOTHING).

I finally got fed up with having over $2400 in E.R. bills alone, that I decided that I need to try to help myself when it comes to treating my pain. 

I started banging my pills (5mg-10mg at a time since I am very new to this and don't want to end up overdosing), and it will drop my pain level from a 10 to a 4 for anywhere between 10-30 mins.

My issue however, is that when I am in this amount of pain, it seriously takes every bone in my body to keep calm and focus on prepping correctly. I will be shaking, hyperventilating, and trying to see through my tears and there have been many times where I am on the verge of having a full-blown panic attack. 
I use all sterile equipment and NEVER reuse ANYTHING. It would really help me if I could prep a few mL of solution beforehand so that I don't have to go through the trouble of making it during my flare-ups, but I don't know if this is a great idea, or a really stupid one.

Would this be a bad idea because of the bacteria that can contaminate the shot?

It is really frustrating because once I decide that I DO need a shot, it will take me about 30 minutes to prep it up. I am very slow at this, and 30 minutes of being in excruciating pain is a very long time. 

I would appreciate any help that you could offer me. Thank you.",1431187202.0
35lpjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/35lpjs/i_need_help/,16,https://redd.it/35lpjs,ShamefulThrowaway15,I need help!,"Hey fellow sis and bropiates,

I could use some help about now. I turn to this subreddit because neither my friends nor my family know much about the events of the last few months. All my parents know is that I was in a very dark state of mind a couple months ago. I was very unhappy with everything in life even though all my issues probably would have looked benign to an outsider. I picked the wrong subject to study in University. This sounds like the dumbest reason ever to spiral into despair, but I've always been very successful as far as school was concerned. High expectations, perfect diploma, the whole nine yards. I felt like shit doing nothing and wasting away. I'd always defined myself as a very studious and ambitious person and those months of not knowing what's next broke my back as well as shattering my self-esteem. Being a sensitive person, I let things get to me a bit too much I guess.

I felt like shit and battled genuine thoughts of suicide. I had my benzos spread out in front of me and a bottle of liquor handy because I'm too much of a pussy for the harder methods. Basically there wasn't a better time I could've found out about opiates. I started with Hydrocodone and immediately fell in love. I took it from my Grandma, since she had some left over from some surgery years ago. I've medicated with alcohol before and booze couldn't compare by a long shot. My life consisted of slaving away at work and returning home to a few hours of absolutely complete Hydro bliss.

I moved on to Oxys, started snorting, popping, smoking. When I was high, I felt like no issue could ever touch me. I railed 60mg before going to lunch with my mom once and she thought I had genuinely beat the shit that had occurred and figured out a plan for my life. She didn't notice my pupils, thank God. This went on for perhaps 2-3 months of me regularly consuming a good amount of Oxy.

So now I'm back in University. I have picked up a subject I enjoy, I could see myself spending the rest of my life with this. I've made friends, I successfully got off my SSRIs and I'm keeping up with my work for school just fine. Nevertheless, I've hit up the local methadone clinic and cold copped a gram of #4. Why? I was on auto-pilot. I also have a very addictive personality so even though I haven't used in three weeks and experience no physical WD symptoms I have stupid cravings. They deter me from studying more than usual lately and a lot of my thoughs revolve around opiates.

So here I sit, and I seriously consider flushing that shit down the toilet. I don't know what's next. Should I talk to a therapist? Should I open up to my mom? She thinks I'm better so telling her that I struggle with opiate cravings might put an unnecessary strain on her.

What do I do? I'm partially venting and partially asking for advice. Thanks for reading all of this.",1431357113.0

I flat out quit smoking weed because I kind of knew this was coming. Unfortunately I was only 17 days clean on the day of my test and was still testing positive for THC on home test strips, so I got a friend to take my meds the day/night before and subbed his urine for the test. If I don't get kicked out of the pain clinic this was the only time I'm doing this. I'm done with weed while I'm in pain management.

Now I'm freaking out that the drug test levels aren't going to be high enough and he's going to cut me off/kick me out. I'm on 100mg MS Contin 2x/day and 4 Norco 10/325 for breakthrough pain. I'm only taking about half that dose normally, and sometimes going higher on days that I hurt more.

So my question is this: I have a few of the tiny 8mg Subtex pills left over from a Rx I was given years ago when I first detoxed off opiates. I think there are about 8-10 left. Now if he decides to cut me off how would one go about doing a quick taper with that amount of Bupe? I'm pretty confident I could cut them in half accurately to get 4mg doses, but getting anything lower than that is going to be a crapshoot. Would I be able to get say a 3ml needless syringe, dissolve the pill in 3ml of water and dose this way? I figure a 3ml syringe with 0.1ml graduations with an 8mg pill dissolved would give me approx. 0.26mg/0.1ml. Would I just be able to squirt the water/bupe solution under my tongue and taper that way?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks guys.",1431337449.0

So I get out there and I'm parked while we do our thing and chat about shit (he is actually my girls kids dad and I've done some B&E, muling, etc with him so we are closer than norma!) We get out of car its a beautiful day so we smoke a joint and he notices that my back tire is bald as fuck (I'm oblivious with cars...I run em into the ground) . So he says hold up. Goes into shop and can checks huge stack of tires...finds 4 great looking not brand new but in great shape (prob 40 each if bought) and says shit if we change one might as well do all 4. I'm like OK man how much for that? He says ""naw no money man we are almost done for day and I only have one oil change to do no real work. We would just be watching clock with nothing to do.""

So I'm like awesome man thanks. I roll up a joint (as I'm not sure if his coworker is down with the brown) and watch them lift car on a shop lift and change tires. I pass them the joint and we talk about his 12 year old kid asking him Friday night of he could spend the night at a girls house! Now he is a career criminal and a dope dealer but he told his kid fuck no you don't ask me shit like that till you're 16.

So we are chatting and he is putting wheels back on my ride with the newer tires on em.....then he lifts car higher and pulls the oil drain plug.. Says hey this is the oil change I was talking about. Flushes my shit with some oil cleaner and puts synthetic (the expensive shit) oil in my car. Drops car off lift....says grab me an 18 and a 21 off the wiper rack there. So I grab two of the most expensive I can find. He tosses new wipers on my ride, checks and fills all the fluids, makes sure oil is all full and good then tells his co worker to run my ride through the car wash that the place has.

We smoke some black while his coworker washes my ride. Get done and he is like OK man I'm off work soon I'll catch you later bro.

I was just grabbing a Teener for the day but it looking big so I weighed it (after smoking about .2) and it weighs 2.1 still.

So my dealer gives me 4 new tires, new wipers, oil change, car wash, all fluids checked and filled , (obviously tire rotation) and a teener that's almost a gram over weight.

He doesn't really care about the job as its just a cover for his P.O. but that's still a hella nice hook up!

I'm going off to college (in USA) in the coming Fall and am looking for a drug or probably a cycle of drugs for becoming more social (think-alpha if that's how you consider it).

I'm usually just quiet around strangers and can seem detached or unapproachable. I am not very good at taking initiative myself and just joinging into conversations and also have trouble usually keeping conversations alive with people other than close friends.

Alcohol doesn't resonate well with me and it's not suitable for constant use in my opinion. Adderall, Vyvanse, and the amphetamines work for me but I know tolerance builds up like a bitch, especially for the euphoria. I haven't built up enough tolerance but I heard that focus remains just without euphoria later. Is this focus any good for socializing?

Based on what I've read, I'm looking for Oxy to try out as it seems to help many people. I'm also strongly interested by research chemicals mimicking amphetamines like 2-FMA, 2-FA, 4-FA, and 3-FPM. I want to know if 2-FMA, the one seemingly most suitable for long term use, provides sociability? Also, is it possible to use 4-FA pretty often?

I need advice to build a schedule of drug use that will basically keep me social everyday for the lowest cost or tolerance. Right now I'm thinking some mix of opiates and amphetamines/RCs will be optimal since there's less cross tolerance.

I know that drugs are not healthy and there's addiction potential. I'm not looking for warnings in that regard. Any advice is very much appreciated.

**TL;DR** : What poly-drug cycle can keep me very social basically every waking moment in college? How well do the drugs Adderall, 2-FMA, 4-FA, and Oxy fit this purpose?

Get on the road to my girls house, jamming out to the Space Jam soundtrack, and in the middle of ""Come on and slam, welcome to the......gdrazxxyxss(is about the only way I can describe the noise). I pull over and of course, I have a flat with a quarter size hole in it. So I go to get my spare, and when I lift the lid to get out the spare, a the worst memory in the world resurfaces in my mind. The spare is another flat tire I had before, and I never bothered to buy a new spare because, ""hey I've got more important shit to spend money on"". 

Well, now the car is no use for me so I toss that outta my mind like a dirty dish towel, I have to get well, and I'll deal with that later. 

I quickly phone my mom and my grandmother begging to let me borrow their car for an hour or two at the most. Their answers were quick and brutal!! HELL NO!! I've got to find a ride, what am I going to do?? Well my junkie mind starts working like the gears in clock. My dgirl and I devise a fool proof plan. 

My grandmother was going to drop us off with her ""brother"" and he was gonna get me home. Can I just say how awkward it is having your hookup in the car and taking you to get dope, without her even knowing?? 

So finally after what seemed like a century, we get dropped off. Cop my g and know I'm moments away from euphoria!! 

My mouth is watering as I'm drawing up. A couple flicks on the tube to get out those pesky air bubbles. Slide the needle in, and see the crimson river flow and push.

Ahhhhhhhh.....the rush is almost orgasmic. Instantly groggy voice, and pupils so small that my eye is practically all blue finally!!

Now time to focus on the car. So triple A told me that the tow truck people could pick my car up without me there. Wrongo!!!! 
My boyfriend and I, begged his parents for almost an hour to come get us, take us to his car, and that's it. We didn't need money and we were gonna ride with Tow truck guy, but no they were to busy. I had to call my poor grandma again. Needless to say she was rightfully FUCKIN pissed, but she came back. I love that woman.

En route to Wal-Mart and luckily no random tsunamis,tornadoes, or general apocalypse. At this point in the day I wouldn't have been surprised. 

*Oh I had forgot to mention, I had spoken with Wal-Mart Earlier in the day about pricing and to make sure that they had a tire in stock. They did, and I was quoted $75 total for everything. The tire, labor, the whole shebang.which was perfect, all I had was""$87*

Now arriving at Wal-Mart and speaking with a sweet old man. Gettig my information and looking up the tire I was quoted and then the unthinkable happens. 

""Mam that tire you were quoted was the wrong kind and size. The tire you need is $89 and with labor it'll be about $120.""

I broke out in tears, tears of utter defeat. The sweet old man saw my defeat ridden face and said""  get a manager down Here. Come to find out it was a manager that quoted me wrong. 

So in the end, I paid $87, for an $89 tire, with labor and everything.

The whir of the lawnmower outside awakens me loudly. Nice of them to give me another two minutes of sleep, right? Fuck me. The room is scattered with ash and stems from a long night of smoking bud and watching movies with the girlfriend.

The girlfriend.

She is sleeping soundly next to me, her unconscious brain in another realm, both different from the present reality and very much different from the reality I call my own. 

My muscles and bones crack and ache as I attempt to stretch and lift myself out of bed. My sleeping beauty next to me will not wake up for another hour or so, still stoned from the long night. 

How different her and I are, I begin to think, staring at her closed eyes as I walk around the bed from my side over to hers, stepping over dirty underwear and empty cereal boxes from god knows when. I walk over to my old wooden dresser that always makes noise when you open it and I stare down at the third drawer, wondering how I can open this screechy sonofabitch without her waking up. 

It's always rough in the morning but it's rougher when she wakes up and I'm still sick. 

""Babe, why are you so grumpy?"" Or ""babe, you can't stay in bed all day"" she smiles at me as my depraved soul aches under the sheets.over a ten or twelve minute period I am able to open my dresser drawer, which is meticulously organized unlike ANYTHING in the whole apartment. 

Cut up straws, old stamps, baggies, scales, a jar or two filled halfway with crystally buds. I thought about how ""Mary Jane"" used to always be there for me and I ""would never"" use dope or opiates... But that's something we all think at some point, all part of the rationalization process that leads to what we ultimately all know...

I looked back down at my drawer, searching for the one bag I knew I had left for the morning. 

One measly five dollar stamp. 

HAPPY

The stamp read, with a silly looking smiley face under it. 

My arm pits began dripping with sweat, or dope sickness, as I rummage through this trash and rubble that all was used at one point to try and be ""HAPPY"". 

So many coincidences, so many things ironic in this game. I wasn't getting high any, more, simply getting well or unsick. Dope was my prescribed medication and I needed my script.

I fumbled with the packaging of the stamp and ripped he bag open, tossing it into my shoebox of opened stamps, bags, and other paraphernalia. I stared at the shoebox and thought what I always thought as I did my Daily unholy routine. 
God damn that shoebox was probably a felony waiting to happen if the cops were ever called here - along with everything else, shit I don't know why I still hold onto all of that stuff. Just another bad habit I've developed.

The bag itself only took a quick moment to tear apart, but the stamp was different. The stamp held the dope. Whoevers genius idea it was to put fluffy white powder inside of a sometimes staticky and sticky wrapped up piece of paper, screw you. I love getting high but not when it takes a long time. 
As many users know, one can spend a long time scraping the inside of a stamp to get each and every grain of dope in there. This is a good way to know you are getting everything, but none the less is a hassle. The five dollars worth of dope slowly materialized in front of me in a pile as I maneuvered a small xacto knife into each and every nook and cranny of the tiny folded paper. 3 bumps or so at best, but it will do the trick. I couldn't think about shit besides getting this up my nose, let alone the rest of my day. 

My heart started beating faster in excitement and apprehension, and I turned my sore neck ninety degrees back to the direction of the bed, to make sure my girl was sound asleep. 

She grumbled and whispered for a moment and she moved one of her feet a bit, getting more comfortable. The anxiety and darkness of dope sickness was absent from her heavenly soul, and a single ray of sunshine found it's way across her forehead. 

All of this beauty before me and all of this negativity and darkness in a small, five dollar pile behind me. I should hurry up before she wakes up and starts wondering what the fuck I'm doing.

The night prior I had spent hours nodding in and out of euphoria on a combination of 1.5 mg of a Green Xanax bar and four stamps of philly's finest. ""Finest"" would be ""average"" at best to most users, but still the combination of the nod and the muscle relaxation turned me into a puddle. 
My girl was not happy that I was so out of it, and she was not happy that I tried to play it off as just being stoned and tired. ""I'm just sleepy babe, I promise"". But she knew better than to ask too much, she knew better than that.

I pick up one of the various straws and stick it far up my right nostril, the one that still works, the one that isn't destroyed from snorting coke, plenty of perc 30s and other substances. Oh I will regret this lifestyle when I'm older.

I direct the other end of the straw with my head over to the pile and inhale softly and slowly, sucking a quarter of the pile up into my nose. I lean back down and take other quarter bump, barely making a sound as the powder travels up and into my brain. 

My head tingles and hums as the taste of instant coffee hits the back of my throat. It's decent dope, but why the fuck do they cut decent dope with such shitty cut? Fucking instant coffee?! The off brown color of the dope wasn't fooling any experienced user.

Nonetheless my sickness crept away slowly, retreating back into the darkness. As I blinked, everything grew brighter. 

I couldn't hear the whir or the lawnmower anymore, my worries about the future, about today, about that very moment floated away. The light on my girl's face was now in her eyes and she squinted adorably, awakened by the bright rays. Almost too cute to be real, like something out of a movie. She was not greeted with the same demons as I that morning. 

Her lips curved into a smile and she softly whispered ""choo doin bebe"" to me from across the room. I tried to smile back as I placed a post-it note gently over the remaining little pile of dope and I grabbed one of the jars of bud. 

The room quickly turned stinky like body odor as I ground up two small nuggets of SourDiesel and placed a small amount into one of the pipes I have had since I was a teenager. 

I offered her first hit because I was already a bit high from the dope, and I knew she would get upset if she didn't get first hit. 

It reminded me of the schedule I would have to follow that day, the expectations I was to live up to, the person I was supposed to act like I was... I grunted and reached into my pocket, looking at my phone.

There was one called ""Weight gain/loss and opiates"" I think, and that had some good info too, but it's a year old and isn't quite as big of a topic as this one is.

My question is, do you think (or know, if you have that knowledge) that opiates on their own are associated with a high probability of weight gain? I have seen someone here say that methadone has a reputation for causing rapid weight gain; is suboxone similar to methadone in that respect? How do those two compare to the full agonists, AND, how do the full agonists relate to each other?

I feel like as soon as I switched from oxy to ecp, I gained like 15-20 pounds extremely fast (my normal weight is ~175 lb which is a bit overweight but not much). Over this time, I HAVE been less active than usual in terms of exercise and being healthy, but not enough to account for such a rapid change I don't think. I don't think I have ever weighed this much and I would really like to stop this weight gain before it gets out of control, but I also don't want to stop opiates.

I know a lot of you actually say you lose weight because you spend money on dope and not food for the most part when using, but how many of you gain weight like this? Have you found certain opiates cause it more than others? I think if we had a full thread of opinions on things like answers to the above questions, or whether you think weight gain shouldn't be an issue when eating reasonably healthy and exercising regularly, or which opiates to stay away from if weight gain is a big enough (lol?) concern. 

I'm sure there is plenty more that could be discussed inside this general topic, so please come in with any advice, info, stories, personal experience, or tips on how to stay physically fit when using opiates. So, what do you all think?

I was reading a forum post somewhere about recreational pain killer use and decided I would give that a go.

That was about a year ago and my ""onlyonceinawhile"" recreational activity is now a habit.
Up until the last few days I had conviced myself that any ""addiction"" I had was entirely psychological. but I got sick the last few days, (worst diarrhea ever, runny nose, sweating couldn't sleep even on the OTC sleeping stuff (doxylamine) that usually works great for me etc. Just so you know I imagine H wds too be 100x worse but still it wasn't fun) 
Drank my CWE and wham magical cure! Guess that means I might be dependent? 
The wds were kinda not a surprise and a surprise at the same time to me, I'm not planning on quit or everything I've just accepted that I'm addicted and wanna tell someone, (cause all the ppl I know IRL are the kind that consider APAP to be a ""strong painkiller"" are not the kind I could have a friendly conversation with about this stuff)

Is something wrong with me, or am I just CRAZY?!?!","So where I live Opanas (oxymorphone, here on out will be referred to as Opana [even generics] only, for simplification), is the main DoC for pretty much everyone, and Is just about all you can ever find, (not that I am complaining at all, tho it would be nice to be able to find some good Cheap dope, my bank account would like it a lot better, that's for sure!) So for about a year last year and now any time I am home and not out on the road working, I pretty much done/do Opanas exclusively, so I like to think I am pretty well seasoned when it comes to them, but this one thing kinda has me puzzled...

Every day,I go through the same routine of calling my pill guy, going to get cash, meeting up with or going to pill guys house, and then pulling over and grinding down and getting (usually) 40mg up my nose as quickly as possible. That 40 mg usually makes me feel pretty great and about 30 min later I am nodding pretty hard. When that starts wearing off about 2.5-3 hours later, to keep my nod going or try to nod harder, I shave off about half To 3/4 of another one and do it, and usually end up doing the rest of it within 20-30 min, the reason being is after the first one it's almost like I can't get high again or get any higher than what I was the first time. This is not something I have noticed recently, because I noticed it last Summer when I was doing 15 mg ones back to back, after 4 of them within almost 2 hours, I noticed I didn't feel that much different than I did after doing the first ONE earlier.. the same thing is happening now...

All this has got me to thinking/wondering If maybe Opanas might have a ceiling effect to them, and after you get so high, your not going to get much more or anymore higher than you are at the peak point. I am really interested to know, if anyone else has noticed or experienced this before as well, or if it was just me and either my body chemistry is screwed up or I am just going crazy and it is all in my head that I am not getting any higher, when in reality I am (I REALLY hope that is not the case! Lol).

So my question to you wonderful people of /r/opiates, is this, does anyone know anything about oxymorphone/opanas having a ceiling effect after so many milligrams, and if so how many milligrams before it goes into effect? If it is not actually supposed to have one, has anyone else noticed something like a ceiling effect when doing moderate amounts of Opanas? If so around what amount do you start to notice your not getting high anymore? Any other kind of advice, thoughts or comments on this are more than welcome here! Sorry this is so long, but if you stuck with me for the whole thing, I hope everyone has a good high and happy day (or night however you look at it or where you live) 

tl;dr- I think after so many mg of oxymorphone, it has a ceiling effect and it won't let you get any higher or nod any harder. Wondering if anyone else has noticed this?",1431421762.0

2. Will it only postpone the withdrawal like the loperamide only if I take the suboxone for a few days?

3. Should I cut them up in quarters and take one in the morning and one at night? 

4. Is there any other information I should know about before I start this week of pure hell?

Please help me guys. I love all of you and your always there to help me out when I need you. Help me defeat this demon once and for all. I have a very solid plan for staying sober and I know it will work because iv done it before. 

Thank you guys I REALLY REALLY appreciate it. 

Stay safe, happy nods.

My boyfriend, lets call him Greg, has been addicted to heroin for about 5 months. We've been dating for about 9 months. I wasn't ever really involved in his drug use, and he would tell me when he felt comfortable. I'm not trying to defend myself now, I am probably wrong, and should've said something to someone. I thought I was letting him figure out his problems on his own, just being here for him. I must've been wrong. I thought if I told his parents he would hate me. I was wrong, his family hates me more. What really hurts me, is that I won't be involved in his recovery processes. I always though he'd be strong enough on his own. I was wrong. I'm so happy he's getting help, and he'll finally be okay. But, if his parents never found out, it wouldn't be me making him. By enabling his use, and staying with him, I've severed all of my ties with him, and his family. I doubt I'll still be dating him for long. Greg is the best guy, caring, loving, and too smart for his own good. I fucked up. I lost the best person I knew, because I didn't get involved in his life. I'm posting this here because he loved this sub, and honestly, it's H, who can I really talk to about that?

anywho, i am getting prepared for my home detox & outpatient program (TL;DR of not going to the medical detox at the hospital is it is $40/daily AND there's a minimum 2 week waitlist) but i digress..

i just finished my last dose of pretty shitty dope with shitty legs 15 minutes ago. i'm not sick, but definitely not even close to high. so my question is.. i have about 2.5-3.5mLs (in BC we have the shitty concentrated form of it, so every 1mL is equal to 10mLs; so i theoretically have 25-35mLs. 


so my question: would it be better to dose maybe half or all of it today, BEFORE i enter withdrawl? as i normally do a 50 bag/daily (about 2-2.5 points) and it's shitty stuff but i get sick as fuck still. would it make more sense to take it now (or in a couple hours) as opposed to waiting til tomorrow or the 24 hour mark.. because that low of an amount may not get me out of the hole/sickness.. so i'm a little wary. i'm just kind of looking for someone elses 2cents, opinions or straight scientific facts.. i know there's a lot of variables, so i'm trying to give you all the info needed: i've been using everyday/got addicted in 2011 (end of 2010); i smoke it; i do a minimum of 1.5-2.0 points/daily. wat do?

TL;DR: I have been using about 2points a day of down thats gotten shittier over the last 6 months, i have 25mLs of methadone & did my last bowl about 15 minutes ago -- should i dose the methadone now to prevent w/ds or wait until the 24 hour mark (not knowing if it WILL help or prevent the W/Ds??) -- thanks so much in advance guys.. i just need help. :c

**Here is the second one - day 3.**

So you’ve ran out of drugs and managed to get past days 1 and 2.  Congratulations, because that is nothing compared to today.  Yes, today will be one of the worst days of your life in terms of how you feel.  Anyone coming off of short acting opiates knows this.

Again, you haven’t slept but maybe an hour or two total over the previous two nights.  Your arms are itching and aching worse than ever.  Your body feels like its coated in lead.  Any task seems strenuous.

At least you work in an office.  You know there’s some poor chap out there going through exactly the same thing you are, but he has to dig ditches.  On the other hand, he can probably fart when he wants, letting the wind carry it away.  If you fart, the putrid gas will just linger in your office until someone walks in exclaims “Gross!” (Yes, this happened).

So you get the kids up, shower, get them breakfast.  Both your wife and oldest son ask what’s wrong, there’s no hiding it.  Your wife assumes you’re sick and suggest you should go to the doctor, but you shrug her off.  Why waste the time and money?  Nope, the family doctor can’t fix you today.  You've already scored off him many times and he’s on to your game.

You bring an extra pair of underwear to work, knowing your asshole is going to leak.  You bring an extra undershirt, knowing you’re going to sweat, yet somehow still be cold.

You take all the OTC that is recommended on various websites and message boards, but you know they’re not going to do shit to make you feel better, but you play the game anyway.  Nope, there are only two substances that exist that can make you feel better today.  One is 13 grams of lead traveling at 1300 feet/second, and yes, that sounds dramatic, but you consider it anyway.  You would never do that to your kids and wife, but yet, you wonder, would it be as blissful as you imagine.  No more pain, ever.

The second substance is of course opiates.  Any opiate will do in this situation: hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and every other variant of xxxone.  Heroin, fentanyl, diluadid, oxycontin, and roxycontin.  The list is so long, yet its all the same.

Oh, what would you do for a few morphine pills?  You imagine placing them on your desk, crushing them into the finest powder using the silver quarter you carry for just this reason.  Neatly arrainging the blue dust into a couple of lines with your credit card.  You take the dollar bill out of your wallet and gently roll it in a tube shape.  Patiently. you bend down, put the bill to your nose, and slowly inhale the small mound of medicine.

Oh, how smooth that was!  The familiar drip down your throat starts and you know in a matter of minutes how much better you’ll feel.

So you wait, listening to the response of your body.  You can literally feel the pain stopping.  Every minute better than the previous until normalcy returns to your cells.  Your skin, your brain, your muscles, they all thank you in unison.

But you don’t have any morphine, do you?  Nope, nothing.  So all you can do is hope and pray.  Please let tomorrow be better than today.  But its only 8:30 in the morning, tomorrow is a long time off!

Will this be the last time I do drugs?  Will contentment ever be mine sober?  Please god, let me sleep.",1431362638.0

I had been taking Suboxone for 8 years.  8 fucking years.  What was initially supposed to be a 1-2 week thing, then a 4-6 month thing, has consumed a good part of my life for 8 years.
That’s it, I’m done.  Fuck it, I am done.

So I get my last prescription of 30/8mg strips.  I’m supposed to take 8mg/day, but I only really take about 2mg every day to every other day.  I cut the strips into small pieces, and only take what I have to in order to not feel bad.

6 months later, I’m down to my last piece.  I’m sitting in my car ready to put that 0.5mg strip under my tongue when the wind blows it off my finger and in between my car seat and console.  I look for it for about 45 minutes, but between the fried chicken crumbs and god knows what else, there is no finding it.  Today will be my first on the journey without Suboxone.

The first week is a breeze.  I’m used to coming off short term opiates which is rough days2-4.  But so far, I feel ok, maybe this won’t be a problem at all.  In fact, by day 7 off of the sub, I almost feel fine.  Well, by week 2, things get much worse physically, but mentally they are great!  In fact, I feel like I’m high, I’m chatty and in a great mood.  I’m starting to get lethargic, but thankfully, I don’t feel depressed like I was expecting to.

In fact, I'm so happy, my wife thinks I'm using.  She knows I’m detoxing off of Suboxone and so is expecting me to be sick and depressed, but since I’m really happy, she accuses me of being high.  I tell her my brain hasn’t produced its own endorphins in 15 years, and now it’s kicking into overdrive.  I feel speedy, high, chatty, all good stuff.  Unfortunately, the pink cloud only lasts about 4 days.  Shit.

Week 3 is about the same as week 2, but without the fake high.  I’m not really sleeping, but I’m not tired.  I’m able to get up in the morning and do things, but not for very long.  I feel like a battery that doesn’t have a long life.  I’m ok for about 30 minutes, and then I get really tired.  The nights are the worst.  Arms itching, legs jumping, no sleep and this is 21 days without any Sub.  The symptoms aren't as bad as a detox off heroin, but not pleasant.

Week 4 is a little better than week 3, but not by much.  And the weird thing is that one night I’ll barely have the itchies and then start thinking I’m in the clear, but the next night it’ll come back with a vengeance.  I’m used to things moving in an orderly, linear fashion, and this thing has a mind of its own.

I would say I stopped feeling any withdrawal symptoms after about 6 weeks.  So yeah, the long duration really sucked.  And that’s after tapering down to about 1mg to 0.5mg.  But I’m finally off.  Opiate free.  Hooray!

And you would think that someone who detoxed off of Sub once would never get hooked on it again, right?  Uh huh, yep, totally right.  And drug users never lie either.

About 7 weeks out it hits you, the cravings.  Hey, just do a little bit.  I’m still not at 100% physically, and as long as I’ve been taking Sub, it could be 6 months until I feel normal again.  Call your friend and just get a couple of strips.  You’ll only do them when you have to work in the yard or have a lot going on at the job.
Buy about 5 strips off the internet to keep around the house for special occasions.  Better yet, call the doctor and get him to call you in another prescription in.  Boom done, when you get off work this afternoon, you’ll have 30 strips at your disposal.  Don’t worry, you won’t get hooked, you just want to know what it’s like to feel good again.  Just a small piece is all you’ll take tonight.

So, I’ve been off of Suboxone (and all opiates and drugs for that matter) for about 7 or 8 weeks and what do I do?  Call the doctor and ask him for a script.  Just to use every once in a while when I need a little extra energy.  Right.

When I get to the pharmacy to pick it up, I can’t believe it’s really there.  In another 10 minutes, I will once again, start the journey.  I will feel that rush of pleasure pour over my body.  I will be able to feel happy.  I will be able to work effortlessly.

I get to my car, open the bottle and pull out a packet.  I carefully open it and tear about a third of the 8mg strip off.  Then I wait.  I stare at the orange film sitting on top of my index finger.  The power that such a tiny thing can hold over someone.  It’s fascinating, really.

I gently slide it underneath my tongue, careful not to swallow too often.  I set the timer on my watch so I know precisely how long it’s been since I’ve taken my dose.  After about 15 minutes, the first trickles of pleasure reach my extremities.  About this time my wife calls and asks if I want to have supper with her and her grandfather.

She could’ve asked if I wanted to go Christmas shopping and I would’ve said yes.  For the first time in months, all is right with the world.  Debts are settled, grudges forgotten, peace is everywhere.
I pull up to my wife’s grandfather’s house and slowly walk in, careful not to give myself away.  If my wife knew I was on Sub again, she would leave me for sure.  My youngest son looks up at me and asks why I look so tired.  I shrug and say it’s been a long day.

I go to check myself in the mirror.  Shit!  My eyes are drooping like I’m on a really good nod.  Fuck, I am on a really good nod.  But the fear is temporary.  The good feelings and pleasure I have simply drown out any negative thoughts.  I’m way too chatty, way too helpful, and in the best mood I’ve been in for months.  My wife eyes me suspiciously.

It doesn’t matter what’s on TV, everything is interesting.  It doesn’t matter what we talk about, any topic is fine by me.

We get home and I’m hoping my wife doesn’t want to have sex tonight for I don’t know if I can even manage a hard-on at this point, or if I do, if I would even be able to finish the job.  Thankfully she’s too tired so we just go to bed.

About midnight, my middle son comes in my room and says, “Dad!  We have to talk! I have to show you something!”

“What is it?”

“Just come see, now.”

He leads me to my car where he shows me my bottle of Sub.  “What are you doing going through my car at midnight?”, I ask.

“I was looking for a cigarette.  What in the hell is this?”

.He knew my troubles with getting off of Suboxone and drugs.  My whole family did.  It ultimately took me about 7 years and dozens of tries before getting it right.  I ask him not to, but he tells my wife anyway.  She’s more sad than mad, asks me why, etc.

How do I answer?  She doesn’t understand this, only another user can understand.  I tell her I’m sorry and that I won’t take anymore.  I take the bottle to my office and keep it there.

Of course, over the next 3 months, I exhaust my supply.  It never was as good as the first time, and that was frustrating.  I would go 4 days without taking any and then take 16mgs, and it would feel no different than if I took 2mg.

Over the course of these 3 months, I did feel as if I was happier.  I felt like I spent much less time thinking about drugs and was just more content.  Nonetheless, I am now out.  Decision time.  If I go and see the doctor, he will write me another script with 3 refills.  Probably enough to last me 8 months, and there is no doubt in my mind I will use it all.  If I don’t go see the doctor, I know that my body is now tolerant again and I will go through withdrawals again.  Fuck me.

I decide to not go and see the doctor.  The reasons are numerous and varied.  When I was clean, I liked being able to take a shit without assistance from laxatives.  I liked my dick getting hard from a mere kiss from my wife.  The thought of having to go see the doctor for the rest of my life made me sick to my stomach.  I could chase that fantasy or try to live in the real world for a while.

So I know what’s coming, I just don’t know how bad it’s going to be.  Well, the withdrawals played out exactly the same as the first time.  They lasted about 4-5 weeks and the severity was about the same.  I just rode it out, didn’t take anything OTC, watched TV all night when I couldn’t sleep, and put icy hot on my arms to soothe the itching.  The whole time thinking what an idiot I am for getting myself into this situation again.

So now I’m clean again, but am I happy?  I think about drugs a lot.  I want to do drugs, a lot.  But I will give this a year.  I have been taking opiates for 20 years; my counselor says it will take a while before my brain starts to “forget” about them.  Awesome.

He suggested for me to get on an anti-depressant, but I declined.  Maybe in the future, but for now, I want to see what my baseline is.  I wish I could be content like other people, maybe one day.  Every now and then, I catch myself being happy, laughing or smiling at something small, and that feels good.

Are you?,"Hey everyone, I want to warn you now: I am nodding a bit so this might be a bit incoherent, but I think I can do it along with the help of spellcheck!

So I saw a couple old threads on this topic, mainly asking for evidence (anything between scientific articles and personal experience) about whether opiates negatively affect memory. In those old threads, most people were agreeing that opiates clearly hurt memory. However, the qualitative, self-reported nature in which opiate use affected memory among the posters in those threads  posts individuals was . Some report a large effect, while others report no decline in memory;  some had effects about details while others had issues with remembering certain chunks of time.

Among all these posts of past fellow junkies, I haven't seen anyone report my specific issue, which I find really scary and embarrassing, and am curious to know if others experience this. Over the past few months when my opiate intake and tolerance were at personal highs (hah), I have been developing very noticeable issues with my working memory; really even more of an attention-based problem really, and although I'm confident this side effect will disappear once I get my tolerance back down, it still scares me: I feel like my mind is paralyzed in this fog, and unless I consciously focus all my efforts on a conversation or my own train of thought, I completely forget what's going on. It's funny when it happens once or twice, like ""wow, I was fuckin flying, no wonder all the cheesy poofs are gone"", but when you walk away from most of your daily interactions with people thinking to yourself, ""wow, that person probably thinks I'm braindead or some sort of retarded."" It was especially bad because I was teaching a course, and sometimes in the middle of my lecture I would completely forget what I was talking about and just freeze and just try to smile and pretend I wasn't terrified that I'm communicating like a great grandfather. A similar thing is that even on paper and with writing, it has been harder than usual to find words; even typing this post has taken me WAY longer than I expected when I started (maybe 20 minutes ago, not sure exactly). I just freeze up because I either forget what's going on, or I run into situations like writer's block, where I have so many options for what to say that I get overwhelmed and can't make a decision, where I really wish I could just break through that wall and just type the first word that comes to my mind and then move onto the next. Maybe it's just something I need practice for. So... does this hit home for anyone? Or am I the only person losing my mind?

Note that one thing that makes this a complicated issue is that I'm on a lot of different meds (I don't want to publicly list but if someone wants to pm me for whatever reason to talk I can tell you), but they DO include a benzo (klonopin) and antidepressants. Now I know that at this point, a lot of you are probably going to be cursing my name, because you'll be thinking ""wow this kid is even dumber than he thought; clearly that type of memory problem screams out klonopin, case closed."" The thing is, My memory was a lot better a few months ago when I was taking 2-3mg of klonopin per day and only ~30mg of oxy per day. Now, I am weaning off the klonopin and feel wayyy less dependent on it now than I used to (down to .5-1mg per day); my opiate tolerance however is skyrocketing because I finally grabbed a straw and some ecp (probably go through ~1 point per day of pretty good stuff). 

So the memory problem is worst (like, forgetting what I'm talking about mid sentence) apparently when the opiate doses are high. Like I said though, all these different drugs I'm either prescribed or taking otherwise could have plenty of undocumented interactions and may not be as safe as people think. I'm just trying to figure out if I can relate to anyone and get to the bottom of this problem I guess, because if it's simply just that one of my drugs is causing this, maybe it's not worth using; or I'd use but try to cut down my dosage. So... can you guys relate? What do you think is going on?

My last question on this horrifically long, high rambly mess of wall text, is, have you guys tried anything to combat any drug-induced memory (or other cognitive process) deficits? Were you successful? Is there anything you would or would NOT recommend? One thing I am thinking is gingko bliboa, it's a legal herb you can get at walgreens or CVS I think, and it's just a supplement that's supposed to help memory; someone suggested that in one of the older posts. I tried amphetamine but I don't think it helped. I am considering trying nootropics, but I don't know much about them and I have a hard time believing they actually do anything.

Okay, I'm finally done. If you've gotten this far, you're probably dead. Sorry.

TLDR; how has opiates affected your memory? for me, it's really hurt my working memory to the point where I forget what I'm talking about mid-sentence which is very embarrassing and scary, so I'm trying to figure out how common this is, and if opiates are the main culprit. Also interested in any other related info, advice, stories, or whatever else you all can think of! Damn, even the TLDR is a wall of text.

I ended up blowing through the OC in prescribed for 2 months in a single month and now I'm going to withdraw for the next month unless I buy street drugs or I request
an increase before my next appointment. I'm worried that if I email my doctor, it might seem that I'm abusing the medicine, despite needing to take more due to my tolerance. Does this seem worth emailing my doctor about, or should I just deal with withdrawals for the next month and then request that the OC is increased?

The previous night holds me tight to my warm, loving bed...The toxins I employed to maintain social sanity are punishing me.  I took what doctor ordered, tripled it twice...and slammed it down with alcohol and Chinese food.  Now it is 5:03am and Fate mocks me.  

The alarm insists and I am a professional...Or so I tell myself as I groan and stand up.  I stagger wildly across the still bedroom floor to the bathroom.

The face in the mirror is puffy and defeated.  My left eyeball is bloodshot, buttermilk yellow and freaky looking compared to the right one.  My mouth is bone dry and my teeth feel like pebbles found in a desert grave.  The black rims around my swollen eyes look stare balefully at me.  These eyes have circled the sun 42 times and at 5am they sure look it.  

Keep moving forward the brain instructs.  

I feebly exercise in the morning gloom.  So cold and weak.  The cat fucks with me.  Her tail whips across my face repeatedly as I struggle to do push ups.  

""Mrowr?  Meowrrr?  Mrowr?"", inquires the ancient soul.  

This translates to: Give me food!  What lie are you perpetuating today?  Give me food!

I shower, shit and shave.  Not always in this order.  And somedays there is no shitting but I always shower and shave.  I need a comforting routine for I am a human who enjoys his rut.  The cat appreciates this rut as well because food always plops down before I disappear into the shower.  

I drink coffee and eat half a toasted peanut butter sandwich with plum jam.  Just enough to escort the medication comfortably to my gut.  Powerful NSAIDs, some ER morphine and oxycodone.  But because of last night's drinking I am still fucked up, nauseous and wobbling.  I think of puking but I already took my pills.  So no way Jose.  I will not waste that morphine and oxycodone.  But maybe I should make it a priority to drink a lot of water today.  I pour a glass and begin.    

Three times on my commute I feel a panic attack coming and think wildly of turning back.  Just get off and turn around!  But I don't.  I stare out the window at the landscape blurring by and will myself to wear the Mask.  Become that man.  Hell, you already woke up...that is half the battle.  

I pull into work alive as the morphine and oxy prop me up.  Not high mind you, but almost functional.

But not functional enough.  I feel weird.  I answer some emails, deal with a meeting and soothe a bleeding department concern all while in a robotic fugue.  I feel ugh.  Bleah.

My suit is 4 years old.  Unsexy and worn.  My shoes are polished but not glowing and my demeanor is deflated.  Very low key as I drag myself through the paces.  Unfortunately, I work near the Sales department.  Young new blood struts around like roosters in the jungle crowing and preening themselves in their Armani and Italian leather.  Its like they spring out of bed fresh and ready with perfectly parted hair and neatly trimmed beards.  Birds of a feather indeed...these birds are all under 35.  

My flock is aged.  They no longer strut.  They merely guard the nests they have painstakingly made.    

 I am their conduit to the newer generations.  When alone, they secretly ask me of internet technologies they hear about but are too afraid to try.  I explain it and 9 times out of 10 they don't get the big deal. And my reward for joining this flock of crotchety crows?  They tell me of sales on fruit or furniture at Costco, the best brands of weather protection paint and they share hidden oatmeal cookie recipes.  And we huddle together riding out the constant stormy changes in the company.
   
""Nicholas had liquor breath at Wednesday's staff meeting!"", gossips Betty Lou from her crooked teeth and weird glasses that turn dark in daylight.  

""But he's in sales"", I patiently explain.  

Unmarried and unloved Betty Lou lives for her nieces and not much else.  The fact that I have become part of her social circle which must be less than 5 actual human beings is incredibly depressing. But the woman is pure magic in the governmental archive research facility so I smile.  She does not need to understand Nicholas earned us 7 million in 2 years and pays for her weird glasses.  I excuse myself from the coffee circle and head to the restroom.

Here I snort instant release oxycodone from my coke bullet.  Then I crank it and snort again.  Ahhhh.  I check my nose, splash water on my face and wade back out into the fray.

I feel a little better.  Still stupid as fuck and I know I am staring without comprehension but the thebaine starts to pump its magic through me.  My appetite comes back and I can make small talk with douchebag Doug from Warehouse Management.  I get some coffee, flirt with Brenda from Marketing and visualize a bagel with eggs and tomato slices.  Damn that sounds amazing.  

""Walk with me"", I instruct Bill from Accounting as he strolls into my office to hassle me.  

I hate Bill but thebaine makes me patient and carves a little grin onto my dour face.  I have returned to my Mask.  The one they love.  I now seem authoritative and knowledgeable so Bill follows.  I do not care about accounting.  I know there is no money and what money we have we have already spent...but I need to know about basketball scores.

My brain is catching up with the opiates and my schedule so I actually absorb my sports news from Bill.  Our team won.  I get some player totals, a few play of the nights and move on.  I look like I am going places as I stride outside with power and purpose...and I stride right into the the bagel shop.  Here I waste another hour while thinking of my fragile existence.  Built on lies, charisma and charm.  I have no actual skills I muse.  I can't fix a car or cut hair.  After an apocalypse I would be one of the first people pushed up against the wall.  

But right now?  Well this bagel is mighty tasty thank you.  The oxycodone surges through me like electricity and animates my corpse to wave and smile and do the corporate mucky muck dance.  I see an executive walk in shirking his duty as brazenly as I shirk mine.  Rather than slink away, I walk up and engage him.  We talk of basketball and his vacation to Jamaica.  Its like a free pass to waste another 30 minutes because he is a boss.

Almost half my day has been wasted.  Tomorrow I can leave early to pick up my prescription.  After that, the weekend is only a few short days away.  Life is good.  ",1431454740.0

""I'm looking for some H man"" finally it got through his head.. he tells me to pull over to this yellow house right beside us which I did.. he then tells mgr now they may or may not have any but what do I get out of it? 

He would only do it if I gave him 20 bucks for a Fucking crack rock.. so I couldn't do the deal as I had no other money on me and told him I'd be back. He was going to leave his old flip phone and his crack pipe he seemed to value more than his life with me as collateral. You guys think he was legit?

I'm not an opiate user - only have ever taken some for a hand injury once upon a time. However, my significant other has used them (beans, mostly IIRC), quit using them, and promised me (and a lot of other people) they would be done for good as they caused a huge problems for us and for their other relationships with friends and family, including almost killing them.

Recently, they've gotten a new group of friends who, instead of the drugs we generally do, tend to do percocets and oxys. Mostly, I would leave them to their own devices, but I've noticed a couple of times my SO comes home with the remains of powder in his nose, and, weirdly enough, their mucus is a dark, dark green/teal colour from what I can tell.

Google's been pretty unhelpful, but I'm just wondering if any of you know if an opiate would react with the mucus and create that colour. I hate to be distrustful, but I just want them to be honest with me if that's what they're doing, as last time their idea was to just hide it from everyone until everything kind of fell apart.

Thanks all. Hope this was posted in the right place.

Despite pleads and tears if wife. Has anyone ever had reservations about letting go of a script?

How bad is this for my health? (story inside),"Hello... I am a opiate addict. I am currently smoking a crack-like research opiate called butyr-fentanyl but something awful happened. I spilled the entire container, which is a powder substance (zero rocks or anything) TWICE!!! THE SECOND TIME I SPILLED IT ALL ON THE DIRTY FLOOR!!! I FUCKING HATE TODAY I FUCKING HATE MY LIFE. Ok now that's out of the way let me explain...

I was very high and smoked way too much. I vape it on foil. THe first time, I nodded out and spilled like 20mg on my pants (jeans, 10-20mg wouldn't get out of the fabric) which wasn't a big deal but I was still upset that I lost some. What happened was I nodded out, the container cap was open, and it fell off the table on my pants when I got out of my nodded state... luckily it hit my lIn a shitty clumsy effort to clean it up, still high... 

Then, when trying to pick up the pieces I accidentalyl drop the container because I was still high and smoked the butyr-fentanyl that I dropped off trying not to waste nay. Horrible idea. Literally the container flipped over and all of it slipped out on my hardwood floor. Thank goodness it wasn't carpet but it's the fucking dirty fucking floor. It's fucking gross. I was so fucking pissed. This is the most unlucky thing to ever happen to me regarding any drug EVER.I had two choices, throw it away and clean it up or try and pick up the pieces covered in tiny hair/dust/food particles... i did the latter... 

Now... this morning I ate a sugar cookie for breakfast. A big one, and there were crumbs everywhere under my desk where I spilled the butyr-fentanyl. The color of the crumbs look extremely similar to the powder of the drug... and when I finally said enough was enough, getting all the white particles back as much as I could ( I lost a good amount, but got some of it back tainted that is with germs -.-) I got fucking crumbs with it. I'm fucking pissed. I notice this beause I smoke it (I usually do this RoA on foil, however, I wouldn't dare put this shit in my nose now anyways after the germs, and I figure smoking it would be less nasty than snorting it), but now half the time, it's a gamble seeing whether it's actually the butyr-fentanyl or the fucking sugar cookie crumbs!!!! When it's the butyrfentanyl, it trails down and the powder turns into a clear liquid that goes on easily and doesn't taste like complete shit. When it's the sugar cookie, it burns up and blackens, smells like burnt cookie basically, and taste like shit. I am so fucking pissed. How fucking unlucky can I be. This is not a joke btw and I am being 100% serious.. I think this is a sign from God telling me or punishing me. I relapsed 3 days ago on this shit anyways (I am a heroin addict but doing this cause it doesn't show on my urine probation). fuck my life... but anyways is smoking this nasty mixture of the drug and sugar cookie crumbs that look just like it dangerous? I have to put the lighter under and burn to see if it trails down, or it blackens and burns up on the foil every time now and it fucking pisses me off. Fuck my life.

First, I was thinking that with my small tolerance I would take maybe 15mg and see where that got me. Is this a reasonable amount? 

B: what's the best roa for these little guys? I'm used to chewing and swallowing, but I'm open to insufflation if it's recommended. Oral is supposed to have higher bioavailability; does it matter too much which way it goes in? 

3) I'm used to potentiating with dxm, cimetidine, grapefruit juice (placebo or not, I like the shit), and taking benadryl. Will these help the oxy too? Am I correct to assume that these methods won't do much if it goes up my nose?

So I want the best bang for these expensive fuckers. I plan on plugging them here in a bit, but it's my first time plugging anything and I can't find a concise guide for it. Here's what I got so far:

1. Buy oral 5ml syringe
2. Crush the pill, let it dissolve in water 
3. Clean your rectum of excess dookie

4. Stick the syringe in your butt, like an inch deep man 
5. Shoot, lay on left side for 10-15 minutes

Once i found that out, i knew my plug has connections to pressers (he's gotten fake fent blues before) so I put two and two together.

He angled his spotlight so we were all squirming uncomfortably beneath the ungodly bright light.  From his obvious disgust, we could tell he was a rookie.
 
The light floods the alley where we have come to worship the Hand Tree.  Around the tree are candles and ceramic bowls of rainwater and gin.  Dev was naked and blood dripped from her left hand.  She glared at the cops with a feral snarl.  Kym wore an American flag bandana on her head and huge mirrored sunglasses.  Her henna red hair spilled over a sleeveless, black Jack Daniels t-shirt and she was squeezed into impossibly tight leather pants.  I wore a top hat, rasta hair wig and black John Lennon sunglasses.  Jason wore a rubber t-rex dinosaur mask and a brown robe.  He was handcuffed because he tried to run.  The cop car blocking the alley stopped that.

The cop who cuffed Jason was the younger cop.  Muscular and naive to our cityfolk ways.  The nude blood tree worship and costumed congregation was not what he signed up for.  The older cop wore a patient smile beneath his handle bar mustache.  His hand casually on his hip was nonthreatening and almost congenial.  But from there he could easily pull his baton, pepper spray or gun.  We didn't phase him at all.  He was a Tenderloin cop.  

I could tell by their mannerisms we were lucky.  They weren't going to do anything.  Not even search us.  While we may look odd dressed as we were and gathered in an alley worshiping a tree...it probably wasn't the weirdest thing they'll see tonight.  For tonight is Halloween in San Francisco.  

""Alright kiddies!"", grins the older cop, ""Remember to play nice and no more fires in alleys OK?""

We nodded.  

""And honey...you have to put on clothes.  This ain't Santa Cruz"", chided the cop to Dev who growled.  He looked us all over.  

""Alright you 2 are easy"" smiled the cop pointing at me and Kym, ""Axl Rose and Slash.  Nice costumes.""

""Thanks officer!"", beamed Kym who dressed me like this.  

He walked over to Dev who was putting her layers of gypsy skirts and wool sweaters back on.

""You are...what Eve?"", he asked.

""I am a child of Light"", said Dev seriously.  The cop didn't press and moved on.  

""And you?"", he nudged Jason with his boot as his partner uncuffed him.

Jason got up and grinned.

""Dinosaur Jesus.  Savior of the sauropods"", said Jason rubbing his wrists.

""Put some more effort into it"", suggested cop.  ""Like add a beard or something.  Well, Trick or Treat!""

Dev looked at us as they drove off.  ""Light has prevailed.""

""Fuck yeah!  The curse is broken!"", roared Jason, ""Lets go get fucked up!""

But it all began like this.

""The Darkness comes!"", screamed the voice.  I shut the window.

My roommates were gone so I could write my biology of hydrothermal vents paper in peace.  I didn't need crazy Dev.

""The Darkness comes!"", said the voice slightly muffled but just like a gasoline powered leaf blower, Dev's voice has the power to carry through walls.

I slammed my book shut.  I grabbed a Pepsi can full of chewing tobacco spit and open the window...there is she is.  Just standing there...I have the juice.  But fuck me.  I was raised by nice people.  I put the can down.

""Why are you screaming?"", I ask Dev.  

""Because Drowned Boys gather!"", yells Dev dramatically.  ""The Darkness comes!  Your household has a coffin!  One of you shall....""

I slam the window shut and go back inside.  Where is Melo?  He usually ropes in his girlfriend when she starts screaming at houses.  Oh well, maybe someone will call the cops.  

Then she knocks on the door.  Fuck.  

I let her in.  I don't know why.  Kym is at work, Jason is gone.  And I sit behind my term paper as Dev makes herself comfortable.

""Is that popcorn?"", asks crazy Dev.

I nod and go back to my books.  

""May I have some?""

""Sure.""  I get her a bowl and pour some popcorn into it.

""Thanks.""

""No problem.  Dev?  Do you want something...?"", I ask hoping my stack of books sends a message.

""Yes"", nods Dev.  ""I want to protect you.  And Jason.  You two have always been nice to me.""

""Jason?  Nice?""

""He let me stay here when I was sick.  You and Kym were camping.  He carried me here from the Steinhart.""

""The Jason that lives here?""

Dev nods.  

""Huh.""

""Did you see my tags?"", she asks.

2 weeks ago Dev showed me her tag.  A sorta scribbly, cursive girly script DevL.  Short for Devika and Light.  Or so she says.  Now I see it everywhere.  DevL on the campus soda machine.  The window on BART -DevL.  Scratched into the handle of the men's urinal at Union Square - DevL.  Tagged on walls, carved into doors, scratched into Muni bus windows...DevL.  

""Yes.  I saw them.  So what?""

""We go forth.  You and I.  Believe.  Purify"", Dev weaved her hands in the air and stared at falling patterns only her eye could discern.  

After awhile Dev asked if she could lay on the couch so I let her.  Things like cushions are luxurious to people who sleep on grass and concrete stoops.  Like a feral cat napping inside, Dev relaxes and goes into a deep slumber because she is warm and feels safe.  

I'm almost done when Jason skips through the door waving a Ziplock bag full of cocaine.  

""You know what this is?"", he says obviously coked out and crazy animated.

""A Schedule II drug?""

""And...?"", Jason asks.

""And a felony possession charge?""

""Annndddd...?"", Jason asks exasperated.

""And...tonights fun?""

""Yeah!  Happy Halloween bitch!  I got Cramps tickets at the Warfield...""

""Hello Jason.  I am glad you are here"", says Dev.  

We both look over and she is sitting on the floor in front of a lit candle with her cards.  

""The brothers unite.""

""Not even close Dev"", smiles Jason, ""his real brother Carl is a total dick.""

""You ARE brothers.  Not blood.  You are the Seer, you walk with the Lover"", says Dev looking at me.  ""And you are the Thief.  You walk with the Wind.""

Jason looks hurt.  ""I could get a girlfriend if I wanted...""

""I am here because of the Dream.  One of you will die tonight.  I want to know who.""

I sigh annoyed.  I am so close to finishing my paper....But Jason looks worried.  Drugs are a terrible thing.

""What the fuck you mean?"", asks Jason seriously.  The coke smile is gone.

""I saw in my dreams Father Toad.  His people lived in the city before there was a city.  When it was marsh.  He is in Chinatown these days and he is my friend.  Tell me brothers, who dreams of toads?""

""Not me"", I scoff.  ""This is bullshit.  I need to finish my-""

""It was me"", says Jason in a small voice.  

""High school.  I took acid with my girlfriend at a Dead show and had a strange trip.  All these tiny toads covered me...I couldn't talk or breathe but I felt OK.  Weird man.  Haven't thought of that for years...""

""Sorry Thief.  But it is you.  Drowned Boys hunt you...I saw your coffin.""

""Dev you gotta go"", I said looking at the clock.  

And like perfect movie timing the door burst open and Kym stood there.  Her face hardened instantly when she saw us on the floor gathered around a candle with Dev.

""What the fuck is SHE doing here?"", asks Kym.

""Hi Khadja"", smiles Dev.

""Hey Devika!"", says Kym mimicking Dev's weird high pitched voice.

""Dev was leaving..."", I offer up.

""The fuck she is!  I am going to die!  Didn't you hear that part?"", asks Jason.

""Why?"", asks Kym.  ""What did she say?""

An hour later the sun had set and we were dressed like fools.  I was Slash, Kym was Axl Rose and Jason was the Jesus lizard thing.  We smoked heroin drawn in sanskrit patterns of protection off foil and plan out our night.  I can watch myself smoke in the reflection of Kym's mirrored sunglasses.

""God's flesh!"", says Dev handing us mushrooms from her backpack.  

They are fresh mushrooms and we eat them with the waffles.  Well, now shit is about to get weird.  Jason is a broken man convinced he will die.  He gives us cocaine and heroin.  I have some Humboldt bud we smoke between cigarettes.  Then it starts to POUR rain.  The sound shakes the apartment.

""Fuck!"", moans Jason covering his face, ""See?  She is right!  Drowned Boys are coming for me!""

""Not yet..."", says Dev lazily.  ""What is your schedule Thief?""

""Why do you keep calling me that?"", says Jason defeated and sad.  ""Ok.  I was gonna sell the coke at the Cramps show.  After that Kym has the Mr. Maru party and that's it.""

""Hmm...Mr. Maru.  Not sure what he is.  Human?  Maybe.  But what side is he on?  I don't know"", smiles Dev.  ""But I know this.  We can ask Father Toad to stop them.  You are loved Thief.  His children protect you...""

""Lets do it then"", says Kym cracking her knuckles.  ""Where can we find the Toad God?""

Kym is wasted and crazy looking as Axl Rose.  I watch myself take a bong hit in the reflection of her mirrored sunglasses.  

""The Hand Tree.  Portal to the Gods.  Jason, we will need rainwater and your blood.""

""Fuck.""

I stare at these people.  We have 11 eight balls of coke.  Tar and Dragon powder H.  We ate mushrooms and smoked weed.  It's Halloween, we have free Cramps tickets and Kym is a hostess at Mr. Maru's Queen Deviant Halloween party with nitrous oxide, nudity and psychic surgery?  Am I the only one that thinks Dev is a downer?

But looking back.  Not much happened.  Dev got naked, cut Jason's palm, cut her fingers and dropped blood into rainwater bowls.  We offered gin, candles, weed and cigarettes to the Toad God.  Watching Dev hop around screaming naked and cursing in strange voices was...well you would have to know her.  I don't believe in Drowned Boys or Toad Gods but it's damn unsettling how loud and different all the voices she makes are.  

And the cops let us go.  Jason lives.  Again.

Kym got us kicked out of the Warfield for fighting goth Snow White.  They were just kinda jawing at each other when Axl suddenly cold cocked goth Snow White and got jumped by her friend Marge Simpson.  Jason dropped Batman with a glass ashtray and I was choking a Caveman when the bouncers swarmed the floor.  The bouncers know Jason which is nice as these beasts are known for wrapping their knuckles with leather belts to break up fights.

Outside I marveled at the human condition.  Kym had a black eye, Jason's robe was covered with blood from the Toad God ceremony and I watched 10,000 blue jeweled fairy creatures fly out of the neon symbols that burned above the Warfield.  
""Whoa I am nodding..."", mused Jason staring at his bloodied hand.  ""More coke.""

The cabbie didn't even blink when we did bumps in the backseat.  In fact he asked for a picture of us and handed out Twix bars.  At Mr. Maru's we could see a torch lit boat above his garden wall that served as a stage for a band.  The bass player was ripping out a Metallica guitar solo on his bass as the crowd THUMPED along.  Hands, liquid spray, cups and water bottles exploded into the night air.

""Oh hell fucking yeah!"", said Kym putting her sunglasses over her black eye.  

We walked to the entrance where Mr. Maru's transvestite bodyguard Mr. Tomorrow worked the gate.  He is dressed as Princess Jasmine from Aladdin.  Mr. Tomorrow is a huge muscular man.  Dressed like a princess made him seem even more threatening somehow.

""You are expected"", says Mr. Tomorrow.

""Yeah?  Mr. Maru's waiting for us?"", asks Kym.

""No.  Ms. Liora is inside.  She explained the situation because all matters of security go through me"", said Mr. Tomorrow solemnly.

""Liora?  You mean Dev?"", asked Jason.  ""What'd she say?""

Mr. Tomorrow looked down at the ground.  A circle about a meter in diameter was drawn with three trailing streaks on the bottom.  It appeared to have been drawn with blood.

""Jesus"", said Kym shaking her head.  ""That girl is batshit fucking crazy...please tell me Reginald, all that blood is not from Dev.  Is it?""

""No"", shrugged Mr. Tomorrow holding up his arm which was sliced.  ""A lot of people helped.  It was like an art project.  Jason is appreciated here.""

Quit for a week and 3 days back in January, it sucked but I know I can do it again.  Especially now that I am prepared with meds like Gaba, Xanax, Kratom, pot, pot pot pot pot and some other shit.  

The worst of the wd's for me last time were the restless legs at night and just a lot of anxiety.  I could handle it though.  This was during the winter so the chills REALLY got to me, but with warmer weather here it won't be quite as bone chilling. 

Anyway I have a script for Gabapentin, currently have 1 full bottle now and have 1 to pick up at the Pharmacy.  I can't remember the dosage offhand but there are a lot of pills in that bottle so I have quite a few to work with between the 2 full bottles. 

Anyway I know it takes a little build up of the med to start working, so when should I start taking it to prepare for wd's.  I am currently on a 60 per month script of 7.5 oxy (was 30 per month as of October, but now 60 since an MRI showed a herniated disc) so I don't think I'll be quitting right away, but I don't know.  I think I'm ready for a break and just deal with the back pain I have now with stretches and ibuprofen?  

Blah...I just want to be done soon.  So how much, how often and when should I start taking Gabapentin for wd's?  Should I just follow the dosage given to me by my doc?   I can update the post later with the exact amount I have etc, but it's quite a few pills that's all I know at the moment.",1431693073.0

Secondly, this sub is comprised of the most supportive, understanding people I've ever seen and it's helped me through some dark times,  so thank you guys. 
Lastly, apologies for the wall o' text. 

Anyway, some background.
Started with opiates at about 16, working in fast food being a baby-faced, charismatic little dude and happened to encounter a Pm Dr who was a regular. Like all the regulars, I'd shoot the breeze when it was slow. One time I mentioned I injured my back and he grabed some vic's out of his car and hooked me up. That went on for a few weeks, then he introduced me to perc 10's and I was in love. A few months down the road, he's hooking me up with full months' supply of whatever I want (anything from Valium to Oxy 80's.) needless to say I was selling and using. Just before my 18th birthday, he starts mentioning DEA was all over him and that was that. Turns out he was writing scripts for his staff, they'd pick them up and he'd keep them on hand. Went through w/ds about the time I graduated, and stayed clean for about  5 years. 

Early 20's I noticed my back was hurting more often than not despite being a manager for a fortune 500 company, hit my family doctor and found myself reunited with vic's. After some MRI's showing I have multiple herniated, bulging, and torn discs,  I found myself on Norco 7.5's on a regular basis (which continues to this day.) Upon mentioning my back problem to an older woman at work she occasionally hooked me up with some Roxy 30's. That went on for years and eventually, through casual conversation I discovered one of my employees could regularly get 30's, 15's, 10's,  and opana's(these, sadly, were short lived)
Which brings us to now. My only connection uses H almost exclusively, but hooks me up with 30's (A 215) when they're available ( maybe twice a month at most :-/), I tried H for about 2 weeks straight, then experienced w/d's from hell so never went back even though it's always available and amazing quality . And now I get to go through two weeks a month dry because, frankly, I can't cop without establishing rapport because dealers take one look at me and assume I'm under cover.",1431664257.0

I get dropped off at his house and we're off to what I thought was the dope mans house, I was wrong. We have to go meet up with this other dude who takes the money and says we have to meet up with him down the road cause the lady he buys from doesn't like strangers. Whatever, it's the country and people in the country are weird, you get used to it. Now living in the city I always followed the golden rule of never let your money leave without first getting the product but in the slower lower this rule doesn't apply cause fucking country folk I guess. We wait by the spot for 20 minutes when I finally see his car pull up behind ours, victory and finally some relief, fucking wrong again. Dude gets out of the car with a shiner and blood all over his jeans, pulls out 4 stamp bags covered in blood and says ""dude tried to rob me, socked me in the eye, but I stabbed him a bunch of times and took these out of his pocket"". I just nod my head and say thanks, than dude starts running off on a tangent ""we gotta go get the burner, this dude is gonna be looking for me, we gotta get him before he gets us"" all the while I'm thinking who is this we business you keep talking about. Luckily the few bags I got were fat and potent, I wasn't gonna sniff bloody dope so I ended up smoking it, pretty good but I really wanted to get a good drip on.

TL;DR Middle men suck, people stabbing people, I'm out $80, got 4 bags though.

Recently my partner asked me if I've been using, which was yet another sign that I need to cut fucking down.

I've been on Subs for a while, but I lost my health insurance so my generous doctor's overprescription has left me with a very finite supply. Still, though, I've been using at least once a week since I got on the stuff in the first place. It really sucks. I'll use for a day or two and have fun – but then $80-$160 later, I'm out of money (literally. Unemployment sucks) and have to go through the induction period of sub all over again. 

So there I am, three or four days into sub, FINALLY feeling better (mostly because – due to having a limited supply of subs – I use less than I should in order to really feel *well*), and – instead of thinking ""hey, this is great. I should stay this way!"" – I go and use again, starting the whole thing over.

Well that cycle was fine for a while; but recently my partner's been catching on. My whole ""I'm always tired"" schtick isn't flying so well anymore and I decided I need to REALLY cut down.

I lost a job recently and let myself go really hard for all of last week. I've had a pretty hellish withdrawal/induction since Monday (really, way worse than usual – stomach cramps, constant sweating – even while on 10mg of sub) and am now, on my fourth day, finally feeling pretty good.

But I'm on Netflix and looking for something to watch... Out of nowhere I remember the early morning hours over my last weekend binge, while I was alone, watching The Price Winner of Defiance Ohio while out of my fucking mind and nodding hard as any obsequious yes-man – and I can fucking FEEL how hard I want to go back to that place. I had conviction for a few days – that's what counts, right? Remembering one fucking movie is all it takes to make my hands start reaching for the phone without me even thinking of it.

It happens every so often. I'll just be going about my day and all of a sudden – the thought pops into my head – ""let's get high.""

I think, ""nah, I'm too fucking broke for this. Plus, you've got a partner to take into account. Let's buy groceries instead.""

The next thing I know, I'm at the ATM with my dealer on his way and I bought groceries on my credit card instead of my debit.

Even just going outside makes me want to use. I took out the garbage yesterday and stood outside my building for a minute, enjoying the breeze. I looked over at the corner, where the major avenue is, and thought ""man, Im so much fucking cooler when I've got this secret hiding in my pocket.""

I haven't had more than 7 days clean time in over a year. I am ALWAYS trying to quit – ALWAYS in some stage of dependence, withdrawal, induction, or worse. Even when I'm high, I still sometimes feel that hot painful shoulder sweat that comes on in early withdrawal. It's. Never. Enough.

The worst part is that I'm not even TRULY sick of it yet.",1431624589.0

Well, I did manage to scramble together a couple 10 mg Ambien to help me ride this out. I went to work, sick as fuck and kind of fucked from the Ambien, and didn't get home until 12. At 12:30, who do you think called me? I was never expecting to hear from this guy ever again. So we met at our usual spot, and he explained that his girlfriend actually did spill water all over the bags, and that they had spent the whole day sick too. I had paid for 5 stamps, but he gave me 7 because he felt so bad! He's literally the nicest dude ever, drugs or no drugs. I was shocked and kind of hurt when I thought he had tried to rip me off.

Had to get a rental while mine was being fixed.  On the day I was to return the rental, I also hooked up with 12 10mg Oxy.  This was before I was getting my own script.  So that was 60 bucks worth of pills with my hookup.  Cool, ready for the weekend.  Gonna get my car back, down some opiates and life will be good as fuck.  

So I cop my pills, go back to work to finish the day, then drive to the rental place to return my rental car.  As I'm about half way home (maybe 10 minutes into the ride) it hits me.  It fucking hits me like a ton of bricks on your worst day of withdrawal.

I LEFT THE FUCKING PILLS IN THE RENTAL!!!!    A little cigarette box wrap with 12 pills in it just sitting in the middle console.  So when I calmed down for a second, I called the rental place.  I told them I left my meds in the car and to please get them for me as I am on my way back.

""sir, we didn't find any meds in the car""   

What the fuck????    It's only been there 10 minutes, where is the fucking car?  

""sir, the car is being cleaned and prepped for the next rental""

FUUUUCK.  I hang up and fly like a bat out of hell to the rental place.  As I'm driving I'm trying to think how to handle this.  Everything I thought of went out the window when I walked up and saw 2 guys vacuuming out my car.  

I asked these 2 shady fucks if they found my pills, of course they say no. I looked in the fucking vacuum container and there wasn't anything in there either.  So I accused them a few more times of taking my shit and please give it back.  After they kept denying it, the reality set in that even if they took them I'm not getting them back.  Not to mention I don't want to create a scene looking for my illegally obtained Opiates.  So I finally just said fuck this and left, drove straight to the girls house and got some more.
