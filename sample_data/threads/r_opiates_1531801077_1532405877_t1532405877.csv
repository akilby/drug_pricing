So the veins in my arms need a break, and at this point so do my hands. I got these really tiny rigs (50 units and a 6mm needle) from the exchange near us so they're great for small veins. Question is: when I hit in certain veins near the top of my middle knuckle (so on the finger itself, not where it joins the hand) I get a register and hit slowly and it barely hurts, but it irritates my finger to the point where it's difficult to use for a few days. I still feel at least some of the hit though. But if I hit in the vein to the side of that knuckle, there aren't hardly any consequences. The obvious answer here is: just use the veins to the sides of the knuckle, but finding a register there is difficult whereas hitting the top of the knuckle is virtually an instant and guaranteed register. Is there any reason for this difference? Both of the veins are fairly thick and I inject very slowly using a clean needle.  I'm also shooting tar by the way. 

Thanks!",1532404123.0

I wanted to, but it was hard to find a place to put it and as it was, there were too many elements that were too difficult to tie together for me to make it work. So now I have a chance. Most of it you have never heard, but there are some things with which you should be familiar. For instance, you might recognize where it starts.

It starts in that second-floor studio in that white washed adobe building across from the jail. The one my mom paid rent for over the phone, you remember right? It smelled like hot metal. It’s where I dated that red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over to see me hours before she ever showed up. It’s where I met Danielle. I’m sure you remember her, but now that I think about it, I don’t know if I ever told you that it smelled like hot metal. Anyway, now you know. It smelled like hot metal, and it was miserable.

So, this dope dealing couple had lived there. Bo and Angel. That’s how I knew the place existed, and I had even tried to sleep on a pile of clothes on the linoleum floor with cotton fever there once. But they got kicked out, for several reasons, but one in particular was the morning that I sat on the stairs outside going up to the apartment.

The landlord owned and ran a local fast food place called The Chow Cart in the same parking lot. He saw me sitting there. His customers and employees saw me too. He didn’t like that. My friends told me later that he specifically mentioned that morning that raggedy bum sat on the stairs outside of the apartment when he was kicking them out. It looked to sketchy. He said it looked like they were selling drugs or something which they were.

But when I came along, six or seven months later, the old man had forgotten that he’d ever seen me sitting outside of the apartment or that he disliked my appearance there so much that he kicked his tenants out. He didn’t know that it was me. It must have been the crusty black scabs on my face that made me hard to recognize. They were a significant change in my appearance, or maybe it was the fact that the place had been for rent since he kicked Angel and Bo out and needed money. Either way, he let me live there. His son sat me down at one of the tables in the restaurant and went over a list of rules that we both signed. Then, he gave me the key and took me up to the room. It was miserable, like I said, but there was a TV left behind and free cable and a dusty love seat that came free with the place. Sleeping on that love seat did irreversible damage to my spine and neck, and when I woke up at 4 every morning dope sick and in pain from trying to sleep on the love seat, the Jersey Shore would be playing in marathons in the freezing predawn dark. A combination of the sickness and depression and the absurdity of the Jersey Shore burned the audio forever into my mind and emotions. The damage has been irreversible.

It only took the old man two weeks to realize that I was the same story as Bo and Angel, except maybe I was a little more desperate than they had been. I stole the coffee can of gravel my downstairs neighbor kept outside of his door and used for an ash tray.  He was the landlord’s nephew and manager at the restaurant. That never looks good. Even Bo and Angel hadn’t done that.

Anyway, the old man told me I had to go in the parking lot between my building and the restaurant one morning before it opened. He found one of his customer’s wallets in the snow while we were talking about it. He was an honest man. I tried to talk him into giving the wallet to me as if I were somehow better suited to take care of it and make sure his customer got it. I don’t know what I was thinking, but he seemed horrified. Danielle and Mike came over to help me move out a few days later and stash the TV in the snow behind a store. I left the place spotless, literally. I crawled backwards out of the place with two rags wiping up my foot prints as I left.

Now, when Bo and Angel moved out of that same apartment the spring before, they ended up living with this couple in a double wide on the south side of town. We’ll call this couple, Gary and Cherry, to protect them or whatever. I remember when Angel told me about how nice Cherry had been to her on the phone before they moved in. I imagine the conversation went something like this,

“*Oh, Cherry, you know life’s so crappy.* *We’ve just endured (insert long list of unfortunate circumstances associated with severe heroin addiction and dealing, like: losing your place, getting diseases, losing another place, getting robbed, being sick, getting shorted by your supplier, the dope’s no good anyway, getting evicted again, etc.).”* This is my imagination of what Angel said to Cherry. That’s why it’s in italics. It seems plausible, but according to Angel, Cherry at some point actually said,

“Why don’t you two just come home.”

Angel recounted this to me with emotion conveying some sort of sincere love or familial bond between the two couples, especially her and Cherry, but I always recognized this kind of thing as totally bogus when I was addicted. No one loved anyone in the game. It seemed like things with Gary and Cherry might sour quickly for Bo and Angel in my opinion. And they did.

Within a week, I think, Gary had put so much pressure on Bo to give up so much dope for free, even though they were paying rent, that Bo and Angel left. Both couples could be heard around town talking terribly about each other. It was just like I expected, and however keen I had been to predict how things would go for Bo and Angel with Gary and Cherry, I was completely blind about how it would go for myself.

Gary was from Louisiana like me, but from the north. He had long blonde hair and snake eyes. I always thought he seemed like someone you see on those real-life murder mystery shows where some guy does something so heinous that no one can believe it, killing his family or whatever for insurance money.

He met Cherry some years before, I don’t know where, and he identified the tattoo on her hand as the symbol for Nibiru. They both loved Zechariah Sitchin. They knew all his books. They believed we were created by an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who bred their DNA with that of apes to get us. Our purpose was to mine gold for their atmosphere, which helped keep the heat in while it made its 36000 yearlong orbit around another star and our own sun.

Cherry had a big saggy belly and buck teeth and thick, thick glasses. She had two boys from other men.  They had Gary for a stepdad and Cherry for a mom, both shooting heroin, meth and cocaine in the back room and screaming at them for trying to talk to them. That was their life.

After getting kicked out of the very same apartment as Bo and Angel, I moved directly into the very same double wide that they moved into after they got kicked out. I lived in the small room between the living room and bathroom at Gary and Cherry’s place. It was okay at first. They helped me get around to rip people off and the different things I used to do to come up. I had some money. They had some money. Our favorite dealers got caught with a bunch of guns and dope and an underage cousin at their house, which really sucked, so we made a deal amongst ourselves to quit. We would get well one last time and on the first, which was fast approaching, Cherry would see her doctor with Gary. Between the two of them, they would get Cherry’s Clonazepam prescription upped from 60 one milligram pills a month to 90. When they went, they got it upped to 90 two milligram pills a month. We were in heaven. I got 30 out of the deal. Kicking was going to be easy.

Another thing I forgot to say was that the little Chevy Blazer they drove around in had no brakes. It had, until the day we planned to kick and got the huge order of Clonazepam, worked for us. There had only been one incident where we tapped a guy’s bumper at the gas station. He didn’t care. That morning though, we got back to the trailer, took our pills and once they set in, we decided we’d get high just one more time. I mean, what’s the point of having so many powerful benzos on hand if you can’t slap a thick tar shot on top of it to get you good and high? You know what I’m talking about. So we headed in the brakeless, green Trail Blazer to Walmart to meet Bo in his golden 4Runner with the back window busted out of it.

While we waited, I ran into the store and stole two of the big boxes of Mike and Ikes, the regular green box and another one of the tropical variations, I can’t remember. When Bo showed up, we got high. I put a loaded rig with the rest of my dope in the green Mike and Ike box, folded it at the top and placed it in the door. We took off towards the back roads. Between the large dose of Clonazepam, however much Gary took, the shots of black we’d just done and not having brakes, Gary almost swerved off the road and then almost hit a cop. The cop turned around. We said there was no dope in the car. They searched it anyways and we ended up in jail.

We were being charged with felony possession. The guards beat me up and shoved my head in the crap hole in the padded cell for talking too much crap. I had nightmares, sweats, sneezes, all of that good stuff. After two weeks, the morning we were supposed to go to court, they come hand Gary and me a piece of paper each saying the charges were dropped. Gary called Cherry. Cherry had written a letter to our judge who had known her since she was a little girl and rode motorcycles with Cherry’s dad. It’s a small town there. They let me go, but it was a known fact that he’d planned and helped execute the escape of three other prisoners only months before. The DA couldn’t prove it. They’d come up with some other bogus charges and held him for three months. I walked.

That’s when I called Danielle, and she’d been held against her will by Mike and all that. But before we ever went to Justin’s or any of that other stuff, she and I went to Cherry’s. Cherry had taken my 25 pills and put them in her nightstand. She said I could have a few. I took 25. She got mad, and that night Danielle and I had loud and obnoxious meth sex until daylight. Cherry didn’t like that either. I found out she had been manipulating my parents, telling them that I’d caused her husband to go to jail and left her and her kids with nothing for money or food or electricity or any kind of transportation in the middle of winter. It wasn’t how it had happened. While I didn’t mind manipulating my parents for money or doing them wrong myself, I really despised the idea of her doing it.

While I still had those pills and was doing meth with Danielle, I would go into bouts of dementia where I’d talk nonsense and not know where I was. Cherry wanted to get back at me, so she called my dad and put the phone in my hands in the middle of one of those episodes. I was saying something about Snoop Dogg, when I heard my father’s voice,

“Riley! Riley! What’s going on? What are you talking about?”

I snapped out of it enough to realize what was happening. Fat Cherry stood smirking at me in the hallway like she was waiting for a train wreck to happen and couldn’t look away. “Nothing, Poppa. I’m good.”

“You don’t sound good, Riley.”

Anyway, you get the point. It was ridiculous. After that Danielle and I would park outside of her bedroom window late at night and talk loudly about all the heroin we had and the Clonazepam we had and have loud and obnoxious sex until daylight. Danielle hated Cherry too.

By the time Gary got out of jail, Cherry, who was a 42-year-old woman, was in a relationship with my 17-year-old friend we called Tweaker Bird. They were completely in love.  Gary says he never knew about that or didn’t care, but when he and Cherry went out into the desert one night. They started a fire in a trashcan inside of an abandoned trailer. It was a bad idea. Cherry burned to death inside of that trailer. No one knows if it was Gary or not, but he’s never been to jail for it. We just know he was there. That was years ago.

Anyway. That’s the story I wanted to tell you. Maybe next time I’ll tell you the one where this old lady shot her great Danes in the head for no reason and paid my friends 60 bucks to cremate them.",1532400728.0

I’m still fairly young but my doctors tend to not give me too much crap considering the conditions I have. I used to be excited for my refill. When I was younger I would take pills for fun, then when I got sick, I was able to get them easier and cheaper. I would still take them for fun or I would take them because I truly needed them. As I got older I stopped needing them as much. I would take them on and off. Sometimes blow through the rx and sometimes I would make it last. 

I lost my insurance 2 months ago so on of the scripts I was unable to fill those 2 months because it was too much money. I ended up just using one of the medications. I haven’t had any in other a month. When I filled the medication today I decided to take one even though I didn’t need it. Sure it feels good but I wasn’t really that excited. I haven’t had withdrawals in months because I am cautious about the length of time I spend taking them. I realized that those cravings I used to get really subsided and it was only a once in awhile kind of feeling. I guess I’m technically chipping? 

How many of you are just at the point that you wish opiates were exciting like they used to be. But instead they are just meh, it’s not a necessity like it once was. It’s such a bizarre feeling and realization. I hope you all are safe and having a good day!",1532383210.0

Sorry but I need to get it off my chest and there are parts I can’t tell anyone...,"This could probably cross post between here and /chronicpain but I’d rather keep it here I guess. A bit of history: I’m a retired (female) firefighter/paramedic. I got hurt on the job and got a medical retirement about 8 years ago. I have been in Pain Management ever since. I have procedures pretty regularly like injections and stuff like that to help control the pain. A couple months ago a procedure went wrong and I ended up with a pretty serious spinal cord injury. I’m working hard to learn how to walk again. 

I have always done well with people. I’m pretty outgoing and funny (if I do say so myself) and I’m decent looking. I got a lot of attention as a female firefighter, my body was amazing because if how physically demanding our job was (when we weren’t sitting on our asses at the station playing video games when it was slow, lol). When I had to retire I went thru a serious mourning period. I felt like I had experienced a death. 

Over the last 8 years I’ve gotten passed that depression and started feeling good about myself again. I focused on taking care of my kids and husband, and dove into taking in rescue dogs from the shelter that need more medical care than they can give (like around the clock care) and are basically unadoptable because of their conditions. I found a new love. I was doing great. Taking my meds as prescribed, never failed a drug test, had a great relationship with my PM doc, I had nothing to hide and he trusted me 100%. Sadly he moved away recently so another doctor did my procedure that left me with a spinal cord injury.

This has completely turned my world upside down. I can’t drive, I can’t walk without a cane or walker more than 20 feet, my husband bought me a mobility scooter and I have to use that for grocery shopping and Costco and stuff like that. People stare. I want to flip them off. But I just ignore them. Up until last week I feel like I did pretty good at staying positive about the whole thing. But last week I learned that I’ll probably never be able to pee normally again (I have serious retention problems from the SCI, and I can’t feel when my bladder is full, which causes me to leak at times, and I can’t feel that I’m wet). It’s a fucking nightmare. Last week the urologist said I’m going to have to cath myself several times a day for the rest of my life. I lost it. I have been an emotional wreck since the appointment. This has taken everything from me. I’m trapped in my house when my husband is at work because I can’t drive. I can’t have sex. I can’t even pee normally and I piss myself pretty regularly. It’s humiliating. I can’t walk my dogs. I have to use that scooter and I hate people staring at me. Friends have abandoned me. Thank god for my husband and my kids and my dogs. They are the only things getting me thru right now.

I crashed and burned emotionally. I’m self medicating my depression with my pain meds. It’s getting out of control but I don’t even really care. I started banging my dilaudid and today I moved up from 8mg to 12mg. I’m in a downward spiral and I see it coming but I don’t even care to stop it. I hate myself. I hate this mess. I hate my body because it’s failing me and it’s not even my fault. I’m pretty young and so I have many many years ahead of this. I’ve plateaued in my recovery, so anything else I gain will be slow and minimal. So this is it. It took an hour for my life as I knew it to be totally destroyed. It has effected all of us in my family. It’s a complete lifestyle change from my family. I don’t know what to do from here. 

I’m drowning. ",1532382826.0

I popped 30mg together with my Methadone and a lil Lyrica. I was floating so damn nicely. I felt like I wore a bathrobe made of cotton candy. I took a walk and every color was radiating pure pastel joy; music was gently humming and every note like a butterfly alighting in your ear canal.


So there's your cheesy and turgid description (inspired by reading too  much Joyce) of what makes Valium so damn nice, especially with Lyrica together. I took a total of 40 mg today.

Other benzos though are completely boring to me. K-pins especially, I can eat 10mg and feel nothing. Xanax makes me feel nice for like 15 minutes before I hit the floor sleeping. In combination with dope or Lyrica, benzos are super nice though. Just an absolutely beautiful mellow feeling, like you're watching a perpetual rose-colored dusk while bedded in silk or some shit that is super comfy fuck if I know.

91abc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/91abc3/opioids_and_lifting/,51,https://redd.it/91abc3,VirtualAttention,Opioids and lifting,"Of course people who use opioids regularly will experience side effects like vomiting, lack of appetite, lack of drive, unhealthy lifestyle etc. Of course these factors will make it difficult to f.e. hit caloric goals or workout regularly. Moreover if you exercise high then bradycardia and shallow breathing will make you fatigued faster. If you have a withdrawal then you won't even think about going to the gym and will puke your ass out. And so on and so forth.

But are these only reasons for why hitting the gym doesn't go in pair with using opioids? Like for example opioids innately inhibit muscle growth. Or they fuck up your hormones. Or they're catabolic. Or something like that. If you f.e. had other factors in check - you use opioids moderately but still eat enough, exercise regularly and sober, have a good sleep etc. - would it inhibit your gains substantially? And how much?

I use heroin occasionally / moderately - no withdrawals, little to no tolerance. Sometimes I'd binge for three days in a row, sometimes I'd do one moderate shot for a few days straight, sometimes I would not touch dope for two months at all. Realistically I won't be able to stop completely but would like to hit the gym to change something in my life.

She told us she only does meth but will never turn away an opportunity to make some money. Understandable. So my boyfriend lets her know we just want to try a bit and see how the stuff is first so we only want a half. Well....

This chick obviously had no clue what she was getting into and after two days of texting and trying to figure out where to meet her (and avoiding her random streams of calls EVERYTIME she took a hit of meth and became paranoid as fuck) we finally agree to meet at a gas station and grab it from her. Mind you, when we met her we couldn't believe the cops hadn't called on her.....

To understand why I say this, let me explain what my boyfriend and I saw as we pulled into the gas station (which is a Safe Place!). We see her, a 300 pound white chick with half her head shaved, the other half in two foot long rainbow dreads, in an old car lifted with huge rims, no windows at all, and every door of the car is swung wide open as she blasts rap music. She is smoking a swisher and is literally just dancing by herself in the parking lot.  As she see's us pulling in she jumps in her car, takes a hit off her meth pipe (and yes! all the cars door were still open). My boyfriend gets out of the car and starts talking about her stereo, so at least if anyone pulled up he could say he was thinking of buying her stereo, and while they are talking she slips the stuff to me through the car window, I hand her the cash, and we got the fuck out of there. We even told her before all of this that since we've lived in that town we had never seen that gas station not have a cop in it, and she still decide's to pull this crazy shit. Oh well. All's well that ends well.

So any who.

We get home, throw the bag in the freezer for a few minutes and then we weigh it out. We paid $40 expecting a half gram and ended up with .7!! Not only that, but it was pure fire y'all. So we're sitting here thinking ""Fuck yeah! Maybe this crazy chick is worth it."" Well nope! She hit's us up the next day asking what we thought of the product, we told her it was okay and how much an eighth would be. She obviously took a hit off her meth pipe because she immediately starting freaking out saying she would just come by my boyfriend's work and talk because we were being way too specific on messenger...... She was fine with that sentence yesterday.

Well, she went and talked to my boyfriend that night saying that her guy got pissed at her for selling it so cheap to us. She claimed that her dealer sells it to everyone else for $15 a point and that he wants her to sell it like that from now on with no price breaks. My boyfriend's response? ""Well fuck that. I wouldn't have even bought the half if it was more than the $40. I told you I'm not an addict. I don't want it that bad."" And as expected the chick back peddled like crazy saying she would talk to her guy and see if he can make an 'exception' for us.

So obviously this chick told her dealer that she sold the half for $40 and the guy called her a fucking moron and told her how much she could sell it for to an addict. She didn't believe my boyfriend one bit when we told her that we buy in bulk and only do a g or 2 once a month for fun. 

My boyfriend has already received 4 calls from her today with voicemails that range from her crying incoherently to her cussing him out but is yelling a different guy's name. I expect around 2am we will get a coherent answer and the eighth for $120 is still going to be a good deal.",1532373531.0

Passed drug test w Apple juice & banged dope in parkin lot.,"Yea my life's been spiraling out of control really bad since I got out of jail a little over 2 weeks ago. I've been shooting boy & girl and taking xans and smoking meth. I usually don't take bars unless I was in wds bc I've lost so many ppl to it and I get plenty fd up speedballing. I love the combo but I try my best to avoid it and used to do well but this girl I was with was constantly taking them and so I started to as well. I've been smoking meth as well which is not something I was ever been into. I don't like the geeky twacked feeling. Several of the people I run with do it all the time and always offer it to me for free. They will even often give me 2 or 3 pts just trying to look out for me bc I'm blessed to have a couple groups of friends that love me a lot. I've never been one to do people dirty and ive helped them all out when i could and that shit has made me a saint to them. I don't keep friends that try to finesse me or always need my help but show no love so the friends I have help me a ton so yea free meth and shit. Normally I don't do it but lately a lot of times if they offer, I do it. Also once they left me a bag and I did it over the course of some days and didn't sleep and eventually I started hallucinating and it hasn't stopped. I'll see colors slowly change, patterns move little by little and worst of all I'll see a bug or mouse or something run past out of the corner of my eye that doesn't exist. The shooting boy and girl thing I've been doing for a while tho. So yea my life's fucked.

I'm also on probation and haven't been able to give them a legit address since I got out. I can't give them my real address bc everyone here is a felon that does drugs and the owner of the house sells drugs. Out of the house. Lol. I can't even lie anymore bc my aunt was the only person who'd let me lie and use her address but the police have came there and searched for me like 5 times in the last 2 years. I've been fugitive status for like 15 of the last 24 months. 2 separate runs ending with jail. The judge told me if I violate in any way possible he's sending me to prison for the most time he can and he's known for keeping his word. I've been having to say I'm couch surfing and don't have anywhere so she is giving me a couple weeks to sort it out or ""we'll have to discuss other options"". Idk wtf that means but I don't want to find out. And I'm on home visits now instead of reporting.

The good news is I got a job today! I had to use apple juice to pass the drug test. The pay is ok and it'll let me rent somewhere else very soon so I'll get out of the rat infested hell hole I'm in and give my PO my real address. It's dangerous and they don't play on that rent. They bitch about it constantly and I'm 1 week behind and I don't bitch about the rats or mould and shit. And it's not just a couple rats. It's a full on see them in the middle of the day running across the floor in front of ppl infestation now. Anyway, I also got the Xanax chick out of my life and stopped doing any meth. They still offer. I've just got back in my groove of saying no. I still hallucinate some though, especially when sleepy and that's concerning but whatever. Oh I've also tried to cut way back on the speedballs. I've been super reckless since getting out but this is a great step in the right direction. When I move I will probably go to a mdone clinic again bc I can't stay sober permanently at this point and my home boy got a job at the same places as me today and we are renting a place soon and he's not going to stop doin boy and Tina. I can resist the ice but not boy unless I'm on mdone.

918zi5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/918zi5/senator_joe_mccarthy_was_a_heroin_addict/,72,https://redd.it/918zi5,sloan_fitch,Senator Joe McCarthy was a heroin addict,"For those rusty on their early Cold War history, Joseph McCarthy was the guy who held hearings to expose communism. He gave a lot of officials shit for being communist or tied to communist. Sometimes he bothered people who had very loose connections to ""communism"" in various forms. His alleged goal was to expose and put a stop to subversive acts.

&nbsp;

In reality, he probably was using the dirt he dug up on people to blackmail them though I have no immediate proof of that, it just sounds about right.

You might even remember a term, ""McCarthyism"" but if not, do not despair. 

&nbsp;

As it would turn out it was determined that the man was addicted to heroin. Well, that explains his energetic fervor in prosecuting his countrymen.

From the Wikipedia article:

> ""McCarthy had also become addicted to heroin. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy's addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused.[143] In Anslinger's memoir, The Murderers, McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:

'I wouldn't try to do anything about it, Commissioner [. . .] It will be the worse for you [. . .] and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn't care [. . .] The choice is yours.'[143]


**Anslinger decided to give McCarthy access to heroin in secret** from a pharmacy in Washington, DC. **The heroin was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics**, right up to McCarthy's death. 


&nbsp;

McCarthy's death had something to do with Hepatitis, some say it was related to alcoholism but if he was an IV heroin user..  I wonder if it was that.


> 'McCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as ""**Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown**""; doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism, an estimation that is now accepted by contemporary biographers.'

&nbsp;

Sorry if you read this whole thing and though it sucked but you're welcome for your history lesson of the day. I also heard Churchill liked amphetamines but I didn't investigate it too deeply.


OHHH and one more history fun fact! 

Nazi soldiers including members of the Waffen S.S. were issued a pill which combined amphetamines with oxycodone. It should be noted that Hitler did fux with an early form of oxycontin. I'm reluctant to say that the soldiers were issued something containing oxycontin as opposed to oxycodone because I just don't know if they had been given an immediate release formulation. Everything about the drugs given to Nazi soldiers mention oxycodone in the text as opposed to the 'contin. 


So yeah, oxyccodone and methamphetamines. Now, that's how you keep your soldiers soldiering!",1532366412.0

I volunteered a little over  a month ago to taper down on my pain meds. After more than a month, the wd from the taper should have been gone. It’s not, and I know it’s because my pain is legit and it’s just not manageable under a certain dose of my pain meds. So, I’m going to ask to go back up the 20 mg that I was stopped down. The insurance approving it, is what’s going to be tough. Although, many months ago when we tried to UP my dose, the doctor was all about it, but the insurance wouldn’t do it unless I jumped thru hoops, which I had completed 95% of them, but the only one I didn’t complete was trying to taper down first to see if it was possible to be on less. So, now that I tried to taper (and have went from 180 mg a day of ER morphine down to 100 mg morphine now) they SHOULD be ok with it, right? I’m not asking for a huge increase, just 20 mg. I asked him at my last appt if I could get a break thru med (norco) because 2 weeks a month I’m miserable from my PMPD from my woman cycle, and he said “I’m sorry, the insurance won’t go for it, I already tried with another patient and we went thru the same thing”. So, that’s sucks :/

But frankly, I look around at the posts on here and I see lots of people in pain, lots of people temporarily chemically relieving their pain, and lots of people who have made their way out of pain into a better life (some of y'all are well adjusted too). And all those groups of people are here to help one another, to laugh together, to cry together. And it's incredible. 

We make it clear to newbies to not start this life given the option. We push harm reduction as hard as we can. Lots of people here remember the usernames of others. We support eachother when getting clean and when having just picked up alike.

I met a girl several months ago via Reddit after she responded to a post about an activity I was going to attend in her city \[she lives five hundred miles from me\]. She agreed to go with me after my previous companion bailed on me.

If ""love at first sight"" is a trite way to describe it, I can think of no better way to articulate it. This person is incredibly magnetic, and complimentary to my own personality in ways I've never discovered in another human being. Except, of course, for the fact that she is a long-term intravenous heroin user. She first revealed this side to me when she asked to use my hotel bathroom to shoot up, and was as open and honest about her history of use as I might be describing a traffic violation, including her history of prostitution to procure the drug. I was floored by this transparency, having been taught all my life that heroin users are the most duplicitous addicts in existence.

We kept in touch afterwards, and seemed to me like a relationship was fast forming. We talked at length every single day, and about things I would be hard pressed to address  a long-term girlfriend. I made an arrangement to see her in mid-spring, for no particular reason than to visit, and I found her in better spirits than before: she'd been kicked out of her parent's home after they found her rig, but she managed to find a place to stay and, just as importantly, begin dialing down her drug use to a point I was comfortable with it, though I found the use of methadone replacement questionable at best. She was even functional enough to maintain a high-stress job, which I still find incredibly admirable.

It was on this trip that I told her my feelings for her, and she acknowledged she felt the same, though warned me that she was in no place emotionally to pursue any kind of relationship. I understood this; I have long known that heroin users are primarily in a relationship with the needle, and in fact I appreciated her shielding me from her own habits. I have done a little light enabling monetarily, though not nearly to the extent to which I could or would be willing.

We made plans to meet once again just last week. And as before, everything was initially fine - until her roomate kicked her out of her apartment for using. In a hurry, we packed up her things and moved her into the apartment of a \[currently actively using\] couple she'd met at the clinic. Almost immediately something seemed off - they are a deeply toxic couple anyway, and she seemed less than pleased with the arrangement. And I was horrified to discover that they have a dealer who a makes deliveries - part of the reason it was so easy for her to get it under control initially, I think, is because of the distance she had to travel to get her shit.

I've been back home for five days now, and our conversation has ground to a halt. While I am completely understanding of her predicament - her commute to work is quite longer, and she says she is in the process of looking for someplace else to live - I'm not an idiot. I'm metaphysically certain she's using more than she was before, and I'm not sure heroin is all she's using: the head of the household has a taste for meth, which she is inexperienced with despite being a herojin user for a decade

My problem here, essentially, is threefold:

1. Can I trust my instinct that this girl is not manipulating me? I feel that an open and conscious deliberate manipulator would use sex and love - in other words, she'd fuck me and tell me she loved me doing it just to get money if that's all she wanted. But she didn't. We have not had sex, nor are we officially dating, because, she says, she doesn't feel she can do either at the moment. I feel touched by this, as if she is protecting me from herself. It convinces me she's being emotionally honest - but I still have to admit some skepticism, however unwarranted. It's also the case that you can ""kill someone with kindness"", though I believe this operates on a baser, less cognizant level.
2. I offered to move her down here with as much heroin as necessary to make the withdrawal process as painless \[if prolonged\] as possible. She said it was a possibility at the time, but hasn't brought it up since. Have I, in my admittedly juvenile zeal to ""save her from herself"", alienated her by trying to put her in a position where she would feel emotionally obligated to me? I do not want to be an imposition on her. In this I don't care if she'd be using me or not.
3. If I approach this situation with a light touch, as every instinct I have suggests I do, how can I be sure she won't forget about me or blame me somehow when she comes out of this current funk and finds something more stable? Conversely, how can I keep up communications with her without seeming pushy or overbearing? I would give up everything here immediately to be with her if she wanted that. But she has to actually, y'know, want that. ",1532355905.0

Usually 1-2 bags would make me nod out, but this time it felt so shitty, I felt like I was still in WD's even while using H, even worse WDs then after a normal binge. It was only after the 4-5th bag I felt relief and a bit tired for about an hour, but still no nod, and nothing like what im used to. Im pretty positive it wasn't the H as I did w/ another person whos got a good tolerance and he was fucked up. That leads me to believe my kratom use has fucked w/ my brain. Has anyone else experienced this or if anyone can offer advice I would appreciate it. As of now gonna try to get some weed and ween WAYY off the shit. Please say I haven't fucked my tolerance up too much.",1532327918.0

[rant],"so I've been sober for about 11 months \[which is why I haven't really been in here\] and I'm just fucking disgruntled right now.  I'm so fed up with this shit and I really am starting to consider that death is really the only way out.

I really, really hate AA and it has never worked for me over the many years that I've been trying it.  it has never given me relief, ever, and I really want to get high right now.  despite having ""done the steps"".

I think the first problem is that I don't believe in god.  any god, gods, etc.  I can't, don't, and won't.  ever.  no matter how hard I try to make believe and pretend and do what is suggested.  praying makes me feel like an asshole and accomplishes nothing for me.  in addition to that, I have hep c and it makes me fucking itchy as fuck all the time.  I'm currently on the wait list for treatment, which is great, but I was recently told to pray about it --  to pray to god to make my medical condition go away.  that's like saying prayer will cure cancer.  like are you fucking serious right now?  I'm totally cool with the idea that ""the universe began in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere,"" which the book warns against as being unacceptable.

\[then she tried to backpedal and say that she recognized my medical condition and it was a real problem I was going through and I'd have to hang in there until I got the treatment.  like okay, so now god can't cure my very real medical problem?  I thought he could two days ago?  and while we're at it and using god to justify everything, if this is god's plan who's to say that it's not god's plan for me to just be a fucking junkie forever?  oh wait, right, we only use god selectively to justify things we like.\]

that kind of sounds like how the program likes to justify failure.  they say those who fail are those who have not ""thoroughly followed"" their path.  like if the program doesn't work for you it's your fault for not trying hard enough?  but guess what, I've tried, repeatedly, like my fucking life depended on it \[and it does\] and guess what -- I still want to get high.  I do not feel any less compulsion.  the desire to use has not been fucking magically removed.  duh, of course it hasn't, probably because making a laundry list of my sexual conduct and praying to an imaginary higher power literally has no effect on the medical condition of having a disease \[addiction\].

I honestly believe that the people who have remained sober and claim that the program saved them are literally just the people who have gone into spontaneous remission.  \[because yes that's a real thing.\]   I've had equal success staying sober on will-power alone and I think I'm actually less miserable that way, because at least I'm not being blamed and told to take responsibility for everything horrible that's happened in my life. \[and yes, while most of it really was my fault some things weren't and I fucking refuse to be victim blamed for shit other people did to me! fuck that!\]

I don't know.  I guess I'm just venting, but let's discuss?

I'd like to hear from people who AA has worked for, as well as people who found other ways.

\[and yes, I've read the Orange Papers and no I don't actually agree with very much in them.  except for Bill W being a pervy misogynistic scumbag.  because he was.\]

EDIT:  when I'm talking about god here on in the comments I'm referring to the concept of god as in the AA literature.  I don't mean GOD with a capital G of christian belief. \*\*\*",1532323346.0

Since then I’ve relapsed on H once and used plenty of pills when I tore ligaments in my knee. However, it’s been mostly just Kratom, klonopin, and bud on the daily. No opiates.

 Skip forward to late June I caught a felony possession charge and in a moment(moments) of weakness used for about a week. I have court the 26th and even though it’s probably going to be another reset I didn’t want to be strung out in RIC court, starting to already look like a fucking mess. So this time I kicked CT but remembered that my doc prescribed a new medication with my klonopin: hydroxyzine. Some quick googling showed it helped with wds and sure enough it’s taken a lot of the sharpness away, much like clonidine worked well for me in the past.

It’s been very affective in cutting through wd symptoms for me and absolutely anything is welcome when sick. Anybody else have any experience with this drug?

My county is known as one of the worst (best?) opiate counties in the country ('Murica), and I am a casual participant.

Lately we've been getting blue fentanyl pressed pills that were very good, almost like they were produced professionally. They always had consistent dosages and potentacies, never had one with a hot spot or one that was weak, just very consistent which is good for safety if you fuck with this shit.

Anyways, I'm still feeling awesome so sorry for rambling. I'll try to get to the point. 
There was a major bust and two dozen people were indicted, so the pills got hard to find.

So I found what I thought were some of these well missed pills. However when I grabbed them they looked different (slightly different color but I think the same press pattern).

The ones I was used to would lay you out if you did a half with no tolerance. So I drank a glass of grapefruit juice and railed half of one. It was very apparent that it wasn't fentanyl, because those kick in in five minutes flat like a truck and only last an hour (unless you smoke weed with them, which seems to dramatically increase the duration for some reason).

This half didn't do anything after insufflating for about 20 or 30 minutes. I was kinda disappointed but I know actual percs and shit take time to work. So I waited an hour and insufflated the other half with 20mg of adderall. After a half hour I didn't feel much so I continued drinking grapefruit juice and railed a whole pill.

This had me feeling alright but I was kind of underwhelmed. I thought maybe the Addy canceled it out some. That was all I had so after an hour and a half I was bored and kind of sober. So I said fuck it, I'll do 20mg of adderall again. The Addy took about a half hour to kick in. When it did kick in the opiates finally kicked in hard, a full two hours after my last opiate line.

I couldn't keep my eyes open. I write raps and between nods bars were coming out of me effortlessly (well, summoning the motor functions to type them was difficult, but the creativity was flowing). I wrote 5 decent 16 measure verses basically effortlessly over the course of an hour while I was nodding hard. I nodded like that for 2-3 hours, spending more time out than in.

I'm just curious what substance(s) you guys think those pills contained. They took so long to kick in after snorting compared to other opiates I've done, and didn't seem to really kick in until that nice Addy euphoria kicked in, and then it hit like a truck.


Tl;DR- what takes 2 hours to kick in intranasally and is potentiated by ground up 20mg Adderall XRs, with a total duration of over 4 or five hours?

Ps-was an awesome surprise when they kicked in hours later after I had wrote them off as weak

Further notes--made it basically impossible to pee (still can't 5 hours in), also  drank two natty daddies (25oz of 8% malt liquor x2) over the course of the night.

Sorry for the long read, I'm feeling too good to be concise. ",1532321866.0

He smiled when I opened the door, and I smiled back.

“Good to see you, Clyde!”

“Good to see you too, Vic.”

“Mind if I come in for a minute?” I stepped to the side and held my open hand out to invite him in. He confessed, “You know, Clyde, I thought about it all night, and I just can’t give you 200 bucks for those drills.” He looked up and smiled. “I decided that it’s only fair for me to give you 250. How’s that sound?” He laughed and handed me five folded bills.

“Sounds great! I got ‘em in this bag.” I reached behind the couch and pulled it over to hand to the pot-bellied man rubbing his hands. “Here they are. Let me go give some of this to Gabriella. I’ll put some shoes on, and then we’ll go.”

“I’ll be out in the truck.”

I walked to the bedroom. The bag taped over the broken window blew up and in when I opened the door. She was snoring and whimpering under the covers. Her black hair stuck to her forehead where she was sweating on the pillow and the strand of drool from the corner of her mouth had dried leaving flakes of white. I put my hand on her shoulder. She moaned in protest.

“Babes, I’m going to work with Vic. There’s 50 bucks for you here on the nightstand. I’ll be back this evening, like six.”

She didn’t open her eyes. She just pretended to sleep.

“I love you baby. I’ll see you tonight.” I kissed her head and walked out.

Vic introduced me to his son, Vic Junior, sitting in the back seat holding his lunch in a brown paper bag. He didn’t seem to have a neck, just shoulders and tree trunk arms. He stared at the car radio with his mouth open. I said hello. He didn’t say a word. We stopped for coffee and cigarettes at a gas station and rented a trailer around the corner from there. When we got to the job site, Vic put a sledge hammer in Vic Junior’s hands who went to work destroying the walls and sinks and cabinets and doors like they were made of match sticks. Vic Senior limped around with a pair of pliers and cut wires or weakened walls with a reciprocating saw. I carried the debris down the stairs and out to the driveway and threw it into the trailer.

By the time we broke for lunch it was almost halfway full. Vic Junior and Senior sat on a couple of cinder blocks and unrolled their bag lunches. The father pulled another brick up for me to sit on and offered me half of his sandwich. He caught me gawking at his son.

“Had some serious behavioral issues as a kid.” He volunteered.

“Oh?”

“Yeah. He spent most of his childhood in juvenile hall and finally he got in real trouble when he was thirteen. They said he hurt some little kid at a McDonalds. Broke his arm and crushed his orbital socket.”

“What’s that?”

“The bone here,” he pointed to the side of his head level with his eye, “around your eye.”

“Whoah.”

“Yeah. He had some troubles, Junior did. State took him, of course, and when he come back out at 21, this is how they gave him to us. They said they did some procedure and gave him some revolutionary treatment. I’m not sure what all, but he don’t talk no more. He knows what I say and listens to what I tell him, but his personality’s gone, reminds me of Frankenstein.”

“I can see that.”

“You’d be blind if you didn’t.”

“How’d you get this job, Vic?”

“Few years back, one of my neighbors, a middle-aged lady, who knew I did some construction asked me if I’d help her father change his toilet. So I say, sure. You know? Come over here and there’s this old guy named George, her father, and he wants me to change his toilet. And I ask him what’s wrong with the one he’s got. You know? *Is it leaking George or what’s wrong with it?* He tells me he wants a deeper bowl to sit on because every time he sits on the one he’s got, his balls touch the water. Haha! Said he was tired of his balls sitting in cold water every time he sat on the pot.  Haha!”

“No way! Really? That’s hilarious.”

“Yeah. So, we did, you know? And I guess he died a few months ago. Now his daughter asked me to come knock the interior out completely. Guess they’re gonna do some kind of remodel and live here or sell it once it’s all fixed up. I don’t know. They never told me all that, but I was happy to do it.”

Vic and I finished eating and pulled out our packs of cigarettes. He had Pall Mall Red 100s. I smoked Camel Filters as a matter of choice, but when my addiction got heavier and money got tighter I smoked anything. While we smoked, he pulled a baggie from his pocket and a pack of papers out of it to roll up some weed. I did a double take.

“Hey, Vic, I thought you were in the program. You know working the steps and all that. I always assumed you were an old timer in the meetings.”

“I am.”

“But you smoke weed?”

“You know, I had a really bad IV coke habit when I was younger, but I got sober to get into the military after I met Junior’s mother. I was 31 when I came home from Desert Storms. I was on the pain pills real bad back then.”

“You get hurt?”

“Friendly fire. One of our own planes flew down on our little convoy and ripped us up. Killed a bunch of us. I just took one in the foot. Well, I shouldn’t say *just took one in the foot.* It shattered all of the bones in there. Now I walk like it’s made of a 4x4 or something, huh? But, I had my struggles with addiction, real struggles. It was crazy. Junior’s mom died when he was six, and I got worse than ever before. The rooms helped me for a while. I worked some of the steps. They’ll tell you it’s the only way, you know, to work all 12 steps and keep your sponsor and sponsee, all that, but I was done about halfway through step three. Flushed all my pills one afternoon and never went back to them. Course, Junior’s mother is dead and an old man like me, well, he gets lonely if you know what I’m saying. There’s a lot of women at those meetings. So, I still go. Smoking pot is my business.  They don’t need to know all that.”

I nodded. We got back to work. Towards the end of the day, I ended up in an old bedroom that was part of the attic. No one had been up there in years. It had a window and, in the sill, sat an old composition notebook covered in dust and dead insects and wisps of white cob web. I grabbed it and waved it through the air trying to shake off the dead bugs and dust. When I was a kid, I used to build castles and forts out of all the different shaped building blocks and created what I know now are called avatars out of figurines, like they were little versions of myself or characters who I controlled in the castle. Even though I could see myself moving them and talking for them as a kid, they couldn’t see me. I was this invisible giant controller. I would put random articles in their vicinity for them to interact with. They wouldn’t have known where they came from. They wouldn’t know they were intentionally left there by me. They didn’t know a crazy 4-year-old kid named Clyde held their lives and fate in his hands. I wondered if I was just some invisible and giant child’s avatar myself, walking around in a house he’d made of building blocks. Was this book something he'd intentionally placed before me? I wouldn’t have known the difference.

I opened it and read from the hand-written ink parts of a story about a cabinet maker with a big nose who ended up living at one of his clients’ houses. In the morning the family would be cooking breakfast, but when they looked out the window, there was the big nosed, long haired cabinet maker smoking a joint or brushing his teeth in the bushes with the garden hose. He smoked really terrible weed and was a terrible nuisance in general. The story made me laugh, so I tucked the notebook into my waistband and walked back downstairs. We worked another half hour before Vic told me to wrap it up. We got into the truck. We rode listening to oldies on the radio. The old man sang along when he knew the words.

I got out the truck at Gabriella’s house and told Vic that I was thankful for the work again. He showed me his palm and put his head down in humility. He told me it was nothing, that he was thankful to me. Back in the house, all the lights were on, and it looked like Gabriella had gone through a short-lived phase of wanting to remodel one of the living room walls. Instead of a sledge hammer though, she’d used two chairs from the kitchen, which both sat on the ground by the wall, each with its legs broken off. There were flecks of white paint and and even small biscuits of plaster and pieces of popcorn from the ceiling scattered in the green carpet. The blackened bottom half of a sprite can and two dismantled syringes sat next to a lighter and an empty bag on the soot streaked lamp stand next to the couch.

In the kitchen, the AM radio blared the blabbering of two talk show hosts on two different stations bleeding in over each other. Gabriella folded at the waist like a taco like she was trying to touch her nose to her big toe. Her black hair and the backs of her hands lay draped on the linoleum floor. Her feet pointed away towards the stove, so I could see her face. She looked like she’d scratched her cheeks with her finger nails, like she was trying to claw her face off. It seemed like the kind of thing she might do. There was a large pot of meatballs and red sauce on the stove top. It had already boiled over and splattered the floor and walls and cabinets with the sauce now black and set like glue. *Is this the fourth or fifth batch of meatballs she’s made since I’ve known her?* I asked myself. She must have cooked 20 meatballs in every pot. Times four, that’s 80 meatballs, but I never saw her eat one. I know I never ate any. Where did they go? How come she just kept making meatballs?

I turned the stove top off and grabbed her iphone on the counter and walked to the living room. She was nodded out harder than I had seen her yet. That notebook was still in my waistband. I wanted to read more of it, so I went to sit on the couch. Victor had given me a joint before he dropped me off. It was the chronic.",1532310895.0

I follow him to the entrance of a favela (i think you people call slums), give him the money and he sayd he will be right back. I let my money walk and of course i get fucked becaus ethe guy doesn't comeback. All of a sudden another dude shows up asking what i want and i said i already paid some other dude for some H, he laughs, says i got played and said he could give me some and then shows me. I pay him and then gtfo on an uber.

1)Don't let your money walk unless you're really desesperate or don't know how the game is on some place

2)There are nice dealers out there, the guy sold me the best #4 or #3 i don't know (the white type that you snort) and for a good price. Fuck yeah.

The other thing is they’ve all been fiiiire, like on a total other level from what I’m used to getting around here.

I didn't care, I saw his heart and soul. Long story short  - he fucks  up and OD's a few times.  I always collect him because - love. He went to rehab, did wonderfully, came back  home to us. He was getting vivitrol, yet the  clinic allowed him to self administer. (On probation, had passes to come to me, neighboring state so pharmacy would fill, ship,  and shit). Long story short, he skipped his last vivitrol injection. Due 8 June. Lied.  He was found  dead in his car on 3 July. Probably died 2 July/1 July from the decomp smell of his belongings. 
Do what you will with this  story, I loved him. So many lies, and secrets, but under that... He DID love me too. He was a slave to this shit. Guess my point is - everyone has SOMEONE who loves them, pls talk to US!  We Will never judge and always help!  Please be safe, everyone. Whether you wanna believe it or not, you're loved and people CARE!

Walking, and talking to myself;


It helps to keep the fear in caskets 


So that the dead will stay dead 




Catatonic direction in low light 


The sun doesn't reach these places 


Claustrophobic attraction to the night 


I fall to my knees and beg to stasis 




""I can't find my way out of this place now""


I jump at how desperation sounds in the underneath 


I realise I'm just talking to myself again 


And I walk on, finding no map nor relief 




Dusty life once walked these low halls 


I try to find solace in that thought


I am not alone, and I hear a calling 


From the coffin I pass; as an afterthought 




""You are not alone"" the dead voice crooned


""Who are you?"" I panick, I already knew


That voices reflective rotting- leather tone


It chuckled, opening the coffin ""I am you""




I saw the empty socket of a dead eye 
emerging, and ran


""Don't go down that way"" I heard 


From a distance I swear it mournful 


Continuing I walk and talk, undeterred.

Except this shit is different. Now for a quick backtrack, I’ve been buying “dope” from this guy for a while which unfortunately in my neighborhood is almost always fent/cut or fent/dope/cut. Now I know fent can be a cold mistress due to it lacking that warm hug from God euphoria that a good shot of heroin provides but this shit I copped today is something else.

I'm having a hard time getting a rush/high from the bags. His shit is definitely not bunk because it gets me well and my pupils pinned but I can't get a rush and I don't get that care free, feel good feeling that makes dope my favorite drug. The bags also draw up in the rig as clear as water. It's hard to describe. Its like all the physical effects of dope are there but not the mental. All the bad shit like not being able to make my dick work and raspy voice are present but without the euphoria that makes me not care.

Fucking sucks. Now I know fent can lack euphoria but is it possible to have NO euphoria or even general mood lift?

I'm so tired.

Sooo tired.

I am sick and in pain all the time, and I can no longer go through life like this. I don't have money for heroin anymore. Pain, horrible physical and mental pain all the time. That's what bi-polar is; that is, at least my bi-polar. The inability to feel pleasure, and the amplification of pain, melancholy, and basically every negative emotion know to man. Over 10 years of doctors, and not an iota of help. The fact of the matter is that there is no solution. I am nothing but a burden on everyone. I do nothing but hurt those I love. There is no legal cure for me, and I cannot afford to fix myself.

Even though my tolerance is miniscule, maybe 1-1.5 bags a day, I have been an IV addict for so long that the withdrawals are excruciating. As I mentioned, I am bi-polar, and I finally get just the right insane episode I had been waiting for. Finally, it is time. I pop bunch a of benzos, to take my fear away. Benzos have always made me feel suicidal, reckless, and fearless, so this will help take the final step for certain.

I steal a ...lethal object. Insurance policy.

A number of public transportation switches later, I finally make it to the hood, and call my guy. I am very sick at this point, and so eager for the relief of death. My dealer has been 100% reliable and sold me excellent quality dope for over 6 months now. I buy 12 bags. I notice he is gray and strange looking, but I dismiss that. 

I walk a couple blocks to my ""nest"" - the bushes alongside the I-90 highway where I can hide and do my dope. It is littered with scores of needles, and I survey the scene and smile, thinking of each moment of pleasure, or rather, each moment free of pain, that each of those needles represent. It is a peaceful area. It seems like a nice place to die, and with little chance of anyone finding me and resuscitating me.

I already took a large number of benzos, and I take some more. I make two shots, out of the 12 bags, one 8 bag shot, and one 4 bag shot. I assume the benzos, combined with my ~1 bag a day tolerance means that death and final peace will be certain.

I always thought, those people who write suicideletters don't really want to die. Or who make a big fuss and long standing threats about it. They do those things because they want something, perhaps something they can't have, or perhaps something they can, such as revenge. But a tired soul wants nothing but peace. When animals sense their mortality, they go under the porch, or find some other comfortable spot, and stay there until it is over. Same with humans who really want to die. 

No note, no phone calls, no threats, and no warnings - just a lone young man sitting on the ground, ecstatic for the final release of pain.

First the 8 bag shot into the arm, followed quickly by the 4 bag shot IMed into the thigh. 

I am so happy. Happier than I've ever been in my life (without heroin that is). I'm so eager, I'm so excited. This is a dream come true. 

I sit there.

I wait.

I wait.

I wait.

Nothing. 

Try to imagine that. To be certain of death. To anticipate a sensation that will take the pain away and end the nightmare of life. To wait. To wait. Where is it? WHERE IS IT?

As it turns out, my gray, 6 month-reliable dealer turned into a junkie himself, and ripped me off.

I thought that adding low dose of speed into the mix could mitigate some of these side effects. For example make you less sleepy and dilate your pupils a little.

Lost her this morning to an overdose. She died doing what she enjoyed I guess. 

RIP Wendy Dawn

90zmhp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/90zmhp/a_clockwork_vivitrol/,4,https://redd.it/90zmhp,CPTKO,A Clockwork Vivitrol,"I'm not talking shit on maintence meds or other ways of getting clean. If that works for you, that's dope.

This literally just popped into my mind and thought it was interesting. 

So if you don't know, A Clockwork Orange is about a kid named Alex who gets arrested for murder and chooses to undergo an experimental process in hopes of a commuted sentence.

Only the process leaves him completely incapable of doing any wrong; as in it makes him physically ill and incapacitated. If someone starts shit with him and he thinks about retaliating, he buckles and vomits.

The process also has an unintended effect on his love for classical music, specifically Mozart.

I had a thought that vivitrol and to an extent buprenorpheine are akin to the Ludovico process Alex undergoes.

The main theme of the book shows when the prison priest talks to Alex after he undergoes the process telling him, ""If a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""

Saying, at least as far as the book is concerned, that if we could, it would be wrong to force someone to be ""good"" by taking away their choice to be bad. Which is kinda where my mind goes when I think about vivtrol.

The idea sounds good, but I've heard others talk about being a prisoner in your own mind, and I feel like if I've been subconsciously using dope to dull the depression I feel and suddenly I'm incapable of achieving that past feeling, id probably jump from out of a window.

I feel it takes on a greater parallel if you think about drug court and how we're forcing those who get caught holding or using to get on vivtrol themselves.

Just a thought, horrorshow or not.",1532282380.0

- Leave Tuesday evening expecting my emergency contact to come get me. (They dont give you your phone or let you make a phone call if you AMA)

- Emergency contact or brother cant come get me. I spend the entire night outside the facility.

- Wednesday AM they let me back in.

- About to fall asleep around 1pm but new roommate comes in and says he needs me to leave room so he can bring girl in to fuck. 

- Pissed off, still havent slept. My boy and I decide to leave around 6pm or so. Going on 36 hours no sleep on top of withdrawal.

- 20 minutes into walk dehydration and no sleep sets in I flag down car to call ambulance since im feeling like im going to pass out even though my heart rate felt insanely high.

- My boy comes with me on ambulance. I basically had a panic attack most likely due to dehydration, no sleep, and anxiety from withdrawal.

- Hospital is farther away from Philly. We are now an hour and 20 mins or so away.

- Using phone at hospital he cant get ride and my ride cant get me.

- I have 40 bucks on me but no where to go. We find out our path home is a bus that comes to hospital at 6am. Goes to West Chester Station. From there Septa takes us to 69th street station or whatever. Then the L all the way to allegheny.

- There is no place to lay down at hospital. Luckily they let us stay there overnight though.

- I still had not slept, by 6am that morning when the bus came I was on 48 hours no sleep. We finally got to Philly. Copped dope (fentanyl of course since that is all that seemingly exists in kenzo these days). We both were finally able to get separate rides home around noon that day. 

- 54 hours of no sleep while in withdrawal + an ambulance ride and hospital visit that will probably cost me 10k in bills, but I made it home  and then regretted it once I got there.

- Currently planning on getting back on methadone maintenance.

- Anyone else have any crazy experiences leaving a rehab?",1532278646.0

Of accepting the inevitable OD that would end everything for me. Seven years of complete and utter apathy towards the people and events around me. 

But then something happened. I had two days sober where I was just shown, briefly, that things can make you happy away from dope. I had given up on that idea after I snorted that first line. I knew it then.

Read below. Wanna just leave what helped you through the withdrawal? ESPECIALLY RLS AND BACK PAIN. Go for it you beautiful fuck.**

Wanting to die is fucking **hilarious.**

My last line was Friday. 

Codeine crushed, watered and up the bung was keeping me ready to human on Saturday. Long legs, worth the discomfort — wasn’t working orally anymore. 

Sunday I had a mental breakdown and realised I had to quit. I’ve done it all and been to the brink of every substance — nothing grabs you like opiates right? 

I went home to kill myself. Almost died driving home. 

Arrive home and I instead have a terrifying DMT trip where I didn’t breakthrough like last time and instead felt like I was suffocating for ten minutes. 

Best thing ever. My mortality is back. Nothing like the strongest psychedelic to remind you about the void that is death. No ego death like last time but wow, hi death, nice to meet you; you’re a cyclical force and I respect you. It’s like the DMT kicked me in the balls. Tough love. Thank you spirit molecule. You surround me everywhere I go and are always there to kick my ass. 

I’m 23. Leaving for my mum’s place tomorrow.  She deals with us fuck up’s for a living. Fuck kicking it in a hospital right? I’ll be in a room with Netflix and a doctor prescribed way out. 

I won’t have weed for a few days but wow — only way to get sleep against restless legs right? Don’t even like the high at all but it helps withdrawal AMAZINGLY. Way better than Valium. 

Any other help for that? **The back pain makes me squirm and is by far the worst symptom**

I’ve broken a lot of bones. Almost died as a kid too many times to count by chance of life. 

**NOTHING** has been as painful as this restless legs zero sleep opiate withdrawal bullshit. It brings anyone to their knees, crying. 

I guess Valium helps but eh... I’m probably going to just get a bunch of Xan’s and sleep it out forever. 

I’m doing 0.5g every 4-5 days. It costs about $250 for 0.5g where I live. Yep. And this is THE shit. A 1mg line once had me nodding for hours at the start. No fent. But at that price — I don’t think many people make it years in around here like in the USA. 

Anyway. Once I hit clean... I shall be trying antidepressants until something works for me. 

Talk therapy — not so much. My support system is great. Took my whole life but they exist so don’t give up if you haven’t found yours guys. 

A guy I pay to call the wrong name in the waiting room and is paid to listen to me speak? He should at least gimme some gas money the fuck. 

I did extra H that day just for him. I may call and reconcile — he has called 7 times to his credit. Professional. 

Never IV’d. Didn’t get the rush. Probably for the best. So I’m thinking I can get away. 

Will I relapse? Probably. According to what I’ve read here, it’s part of the process. 

Opiates are heaven. Opiates are hell. 

What be your advice?

I have 2 pretty large benzos scripts or there’s no way I’d get through this. Valium is a god send. 
ANYWAY today will be 72 hours no methadone. I could of probably inducted yesterday scored a 20 on cows but I was home alone and really scared of the PWDS so took a few Valium and went to sleep. 
Just woke up and Valium def still in my system. Have all the withdrawals except muscle pain and stomach pain. (I did eat twice through this and it did not end well so I’ve sworn off food) but still get random stomach cramps. 
Anyway once the Valium wears off I’m gonna do about 1mg. See how I feel in an hour. Do 2mg and so on. 

Really siked to get this monkey off my back. Excited to stop paying $600 a month to the clinic and waiting in line like fucking cattle. (No diss it did save my life there for a minute)

But yeah pretty excited! Hope everyone here is doing well. And hopefully I’m not back in a few months asking for someone to mail me rigs 😂.

I woke up a little over an hour ago (5 am) with a slight case of the sniffles. I decided to do the most responsible thing for anyone in my situation to do and go do a shot. My girlfriend was still asleep so I proceeded into the back room. 

I get my bags out and empty 5 into the cooker. More than enough to get back to sleep comfortably. So I pull up half a cc and as im putting the water bottle back down I hear a phone ringing in the other room. My girlfriend is a nurse, and tonight she was on call. I didn't hear her pick it up so I put my rig down and walked back into the bedroom. I wake her up and have her call her work back and listen to the call just out of a boyish curiosity. The calls are usually pretty interesting about some resident at her work getting fucked up somehow. 

So I finish that up and walk back into the back room. I sit down crossed legged on the single couch coushon which has become my favorite fixing up spot. I tie off, and for the first time in the past 3 days hit a vein on my first poke. I push off, sit still for 30 seconds, and feel nothing. Well that's dumb. I chalked it up to a miss, even though there was no burn, no bubble, no resistance on the plunger. Oh well. I go back to bed...

No. Fuck that, I still have the sniffles, and my brain is telling me that my legs feel funny. I guess I'm doing another shot. The check was 500 dollars more than normal last payday anyways. Thanks John Hancock and the crew for double time on a twelve hour shift. 

I grab the empty pack of cigarettes that my bags are in. I had a tough time getting my nailless fingers underneath the corner of my overly taped half pack. I frustratingly take the razor blade, slice the sky blue paper open, and slide out a bundle. Take out 5 bags, flick em once and rip the 5 tops off. I grab the first bag, and as I'm about to empty it I look into the cooker and see a pile of dope. Five bags worth of dope. 

Being so god damn out of it when I woke up, combined with the fact that the fent-heavy, heroin-lacking shit I've been getting mixes up so clear, I didn't even realize my first shot was straight water. So I throw 3 more bags in, since I had already accepted the fact that I was gonna be down another half b, and I treated myself to a nice shot. Of course since there was actually dope in it, it took me 10-15 minutes to hit, but now I'm feeling great!

I am a Reddit newbie! And I will let you know now that this post is all over the place! It's my first ever post on Reddit ! Thank you so much for taking the time to read and respond ! Thank you !!!!!!!! 

I have been in a handful of car accident's . Long story short been on pain management since I was 20 years old . Am 25 now . I've been on and off oxycodone for 5 years now. I decided to stop cold turkey 2 years ago when one of my docs out of the BLUE put me on 100 mcg fentanyl patches and still my oxys. I didn't get the rush / euphoria from fentanyl felt zombie like . Came off of it real quick . I have gone through 2 MEMORABLE  OXY withdrawals. You know the kind . trembling, twitching , restlessfuckinglegsyndrome  , sweats , etc btw currently am prescribed 4 15's a day . Green M boxes . And promethazine for nausea due to the oxy. My tolerance is ridiculously high so on average I double up all doses. ANYWAYS I apologize for going off topic. I was sick and tired of being imprisoned by the pills . I am married have a toddler and corporate executive. I told my doc I wanted to get off completely and he said it's not a good idea to stick to the program. I am in the medical field myself and I am furious he says this to me because the physicians get a percentage from big pharma reps from each script that is written monthly. With that said I decided to wean off with the help of my husband . This is where am at now . Today I went 30 hours with ZERO opiate . And I'll be honest with you . The only reason why I took it is because I couldn't stand the fucking depression anymore . I feel like a shitty wife because I told my husband "" you know what baby give me a green am in alot of pain and in withdraw "" him trusting me blindly gave me a 15 immediately. What I am confused about is No it didn't give me that euphoria we know and love . All it did was give me a sense of hey ! Your alive! Get up and play games at Peter piper pizza with your kid ! ( That's where I was ) BTW I've been working on weaning myself for over a month now.  In the beginning of me weaning it was horrendous but I had a shit load of tramadol help me with the aches and pains and mental shit . Tramadol doesn't do A GODDAM THING FOR ME when it comes to euphoria . It might as well be Tylenol . Just FYI . I also have tried kratom in between . A week ago my husband was splitting my greens . So twice a day 7.5 mg of oxy . And I was fine . No euphoria but I was functional. Then just 7.5 once a day and started to feel like I was pushing it the depression hit deep just the craving. Then somehow we decided it was to low and I was to depressed so we went to the full 15 for the day . Which works fine . Keep in mind I want to be off off of these COMPLETELY. here's the main question and the reason for this post . Since I can go 24/30 + hours from last oxy dose and NOT feel the sweats or shivers or twitching or restlessfuckinglegsyndrome or diahreaa etc when before I was weaning off 6 hours would pass and my nerves we're SHOT 12 hours would pass and I would be in FULL BLOWN WITHDRAW. So does this mean due to the almost 2 months that I've been weaning off that I might be able to just stop ? Just to reiterate today I was already at 30 hours of no oxy and I was not in withdraw no symptoms nothing . It was the mental anxiety of me feeling like I just NEEDED something . Am convinced it could've been a fucken placebo and I would've been the same . I wasn't in withdraw but I also wasn't myself .... I was just a walking talking X person . No humor , no fun, no silly , no nothing ... Just present with no presence. I feel like shit for lying to my husband saying I was in pain and in withdraw etc but he's never been on any opiates and am grateful for it but I just wish he understood . I hate being a LEGAL DRUG ADDICT . The fact that I have a prescription and you don't or do doesn't make a fucking difference this shit is liquid heroin.  And in a life of corporate medicine you feel like you need it to get by the sad corruption you see. I am 25 years old and have been a Chief Marketing Officer for an extremely large medical corporation since I was 21. Since I was able to go multiple times 30+ hours with no oxy and no withdraw symptoms my question is am I still dependent or did I succeed in surpassing the withdrawal and this is just opioid depression??  Their is so much more to my story but I really just want this question answered and advise so I know if I just push a little harder and fight the anxiety or if their are more options . Thank you reddit ! I truly appreciate what feels like a lifeline . 

I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LONG POST BEING IN A CORPORATE POSITION I HAVE NOT A SINGLE SOUL EXCEPT MY HUSBAND I CAN TALK TO ABOUT THIS AND HE HAS NEVER EVEN DONE A PILL SO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.  ",1532245442.0

I’m a very religious woman, regardless of my pain killer addiction, and it hurts me to see people praising a real live savior of souls, for feeding their addiction. 
People who pretty much praise and worship their addictions, as if it’s ok, and only put it down as “bad” when they’re going thru WD. It’s not glorious, it’s not “cool” it’s not fun, it’s not something to “look forward to”. It’s an addiction that keeps us enslaved, and what is to envy about ANY of THAT!?

I just need to put this somewhere where people MIGHT understand and have advice. 

I'm 40 days clean from my DOC. Can't really say I'm ""clean"" because I've picked up kratom in the past few days (but will likely drop it again since it's doing jack shit for me). 

I don't WANT to be clean anymore. And this isn't a passing feeling. Everything is shit right now. I'm in constant pain. I don't trust doctors anymore. I've just been through a major loss (death) in my life, and honestly, there's only one really important thing that is keeping me tethered to life right now. 

If I wasn't needed, if I didn't have someone I love more than my own life depending on me, someone who I would do anything for, I'd take all the risks, try to cold cop and probably get robbed or jumped, risk a fent overdose, all on the off chance that I might actually score and finally feel a little relief from this constant misery because I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like shit all the time. 

I'm on antidepressants. They help somewhat, but I'm starting to think there's just nothing in this world that will relieve my pain (both physical and emotional) like opiates, and outside of kratom, which isn't working and I'm already taking stupid amounts in desperation), I have no access. 

I'm too chicken shit to try to cold cop. I'm naive, and I'd get scammed in a millisecond at the least and probably fucked up hurt because I don't know the ""rules"" and I wouldn't even know where to go. Beyond asking a panhandler, I'm fucking clueless. 

Thought about the darknet, and I would try it if I thought the chances of getting caught were low enough. I'd especially try it if I didn't have my one motivation to keep living because I know my chances of getting something pressed and overdosing would be high. 

I don't actually want to die, mainly because I'm needed. I am not at the ""rock bottom"" that I read and hear about so often. I have a lot going for me. But it's just constant, unrelenting misery, day in and day out. 

I have shit to do, and I have people who need me to be okay. And I'm not okay. 

I've never done heroin, but if a kind stranger walked into my house right now with some, knew what they were doing, and said they were going to give me a shot of some, I'd take it in a heartbeat. 

After the recent death of someone close to me, a family member told me about all the pills she has and acted like she was going to help me through this rough time. Then, she kept stringing me along until finally, I gave up and realized I would get nothing from her no matter what I offered. I don't know why the fuck she told me all about them and said she'd help me if she wouldn't. 

Again, I'm fucking naive. I have no idea what I'm doing. And I can't afford to get caught, go to jail, or lose my life all because people I love need me. 

So still, I sit here 40 days into misery, not really withdrawal (though I'm sure there is some PAWS going on), but just the pain I have from my condition, knowing I can't trust any doctors to help me without putting me on some obscenely long waiting list or putting me through urine tests and contracts all while they under-treat me. I'm just fed up. 

I don't even know what heroin is around here (and I know I can't reveal my location - but I've read enough on this sub to know that different areas of the country have different ""types"", so to speak, but again, I know nothing). 

I feel like I've been sentenced to a lifetime of constant misery because I'm too chicken shit to risk doing the things I would need to do to get what I need to feel better, but I'm past the actual acute withdrawals and learned that, yep, this is real fucking pain I have, and it's unbearable. 

I hate the opiate epidemic and the bullshit laws they're passing. I hate that I can no longer trust the medical field (I mean, this family member who died, she died really fucking young, and there were major mistakes made with her care that led to her early demise.)

Is this all there is? Fuck sobriety. Fuck being clean. But not really because unwillingly, I have to stay that way. And I'm so fucking sick of it. 

Where was my honeymoon period? Where is the promise that the pain I felt every day from being dopesick would abate and my ""real"" pain wouldn't be that bad? I'm still waiting, and that promise isn't being kept. Kratom has only been a very recent addition, and only out of sheer desperation. I know it's not bullshit because I felt enough on it to know that something was hitting opiate receptors, but I'm still in unbearable pain, and I can't just keep taking more and more and more. 

I'm so pissed and ragey because I know that if this country looked at the opiate epidemic and pain in a better way, I know that if I could find medical professionals who aren't running scared, who would see me as a patient, a person in actual pain, instead of a chart and a risk to their license because I dare to have a condition that causes pain, if these medical professionals could find the right opiate to prescribe me that would actually treat my pain and help me maintain without my tolerance skyrocketing, I'd be in much better shape. 

Again, this isn't just a passing craving or feeling. This is constantly how I feel as long as I'm awake. 

I hate it and I'm so tired and done. But I have to keep on truckin' because people need me. 

Fuck all of this, though. ",1532230956.0

My wife convinces her dad that she has some kind of infection, and he will do anything this lady asks I'm not even playing so he hands her a bottle of 32 Amoxicillin 500mg.

(Haven’t been sober that long),"Here’s a little background I have done a lot of opiates in big amounts, like the rest of you lol 

Anyway I used to take 200 mg of morphine, 10 mg of Vicodin, and 50 mg of tramadol. But when the tramadol ran out and the morphine was scarce I only had Vicodin and oxy I would cwe a whole 60 5mg vicodin script and drink that over a period of 1 1/2 days or so, along splitting 15 mgs oxy nasally with each dose, as before it stopped working but this time I stopped feeling everything except the itch and pain relief from high doses, I started smoking and boofing h, still no effects, so I went to rehab for a month, I went through hell but was given immodium which sort of helped, anyways I digress, I got out and the first day went back to my old games I didn’t want to cwe so I took 60 mg of Vicodin, nothing 10g of kratom, nothing 120 mg of oxy snorted, nothing, so I had been trying to get a nod once a months ever since I got back

Last night went like this
T00:00 180 mg robocough 
As a potentiator heard it would lower tolerance as well
T00:45   50 mg dph
Starting to feel the robocough took dph for itch
T01:00 600 mg lyrica
Robocough becoming apparent now took lyrica as another potentiator and bc I love the high
T01:30 25 mg Vicodin 
barely felt lyrica, robo is hitting me good 
T01:45 20 mg ritalin 10 mg orally 10 mg snorted 
Buzzing off the lyrica getting tired, not much boost in energy but get the tingles in my head
T02:30 25mg vicodin
 Was surprised to feel so warm and fuzzy off such a low dose, I’m grinning ear to ear tryna type but occasionally forgetting everything I was doing, the ritalin was keeping me from keeping at this point as the effects from it were so subtle the lyrica robo and vicodin just felt to good not to make the most of it
T03:00 Yerbamate 150 mg caffeine a coffee ??mg
I know the second dose hasn’t hit much yet but I start to nod, it worried me how often I was going out of it, my friends would try to talk to me and shake me to wake me up like 2-3x every five minutes, was worried the next dose would be dangerous, the caffeine barely helped anything but made me feel safer
T03:45 
Everything’s fully kicked in, I am constantly nodding off having funny hypnagogic dreams, I was watching archer and thought it was about a sandwich or something and it made sense until I was woken up 
T04:00 went ham on dab pen
This just put me in another state of fucked up I could barely move or keep my head up I hadn’t felt this euphoric since my first dose ever I cried, I was having the most blissful experience ever 

I will not add anymore from here as nothing interesting happened, if you read it thanks lmao I just needed to share this with everyone because it turned a months worth of bullshit into an amazing night of no worries or problems

I induced suboxone on Thursday with 2mg.  Then took 2mg Friday morning and 2 more mg's Friday afternoon.

Im in the middle of finishing it right now but am filled with fucking regret that I fucked up again and have to start all over again on my suboxone taper.  Or do I?  Can I finish off this half tonight and still continue taking suboxone tomorrow?

I had paid him last night and he says to me “I had to hide your money so Bambi didn’t get at it to buy the OCs” 

My jaw dropped I said wtf and asked him why he never told me he could get them. He said he didn’t know and we laughed for a minute. I took my wallet out and handed him cash to go get me some OC. 

An hour later “Bambi” was blowing my phone up. I call her back and she tells me “Bob doesn’t know that OCs are code for H and I don’t really get OCs. Call him and tell him you don’t want them or my guy is gonna come over with H and Bob can’t see what it really is!!!!” 

So this whole time when she calls her guy or has Bob call her guy for OC ... it’s not. He’s bringing H. 

I called Bob told him to forget it and just get me whatever percs he can find. He’s a nice old guy and he said he was so happy to get me OCs and asking why I changed my mind. I don’t know if he’s on to her or not but I just kept it cool and told him his OC guy takes too long.

At some point, with all the stupid shit I do, my choices are going to get me fired, arrested (for the 4th time), or to the point where I can’t turn back and I lose everything. I have never made it longer than 10 days clean so it will be interesting to see if I can not be my own worst enemy. I know i sound weird by ending all my posts by telling you guys how much I love you all but I really do. We are the statistics of an epidemic. Most of society wants to shun us. But we have each other.....and our DOC. If you’re clean....keep it up. If you’re not....do a shot, a line, or make a trail for me. ",1532204743.0

Mainly oxycodone, a bit of H here and there, etc. Once every second week on average, so I have little if any tolerance. 30mg of oxy gets me wrecked. 


Up until recently I’d never really heard of suboxone / subutex, until today while having a chat with a friend that was ‘smashed as fuck on bupe’. He gave me an 8mg strip to try it out, but googling hasn’t had answers to the questions I have, in fact it’s created more lol 


Does it get you high if you’re a non-tolerant user? What if you’re an addict? If so, what does it feel like? 


What’s the purpose of Naloxone being in it? Is it just to deter abuse? If so, how? As far as I know bupe isn’t effected by naloxone to a significant extent. My friend snorts it or puts it under his tongue, which would also lead to the naloxone being absorbed. Considering the very low BA of oral naloxone, what happens if you eat the strip? 


Why is it given to addicts if it gets you high? Is it to safely taper or another reason? 


I think that’s all I’ve got for now, I’ll edit if more questions come to mind. Thanks in advance for any information!

90rhaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/90rhaf/my_observations_on_zubs_and_questions_stated/,5,https://redd.it/90rhaf,sloan_fitch,My observations on Zubs and questions stated rhetorically but am open to actual answers!,"Took a Zub instead of a Sub because that's what I was able to get. This is the first time I've had taken Zubsolv since I've last stopped taking dope 3ish weeks ago. Had 'em before, no complaints. A little confusion about the size of the dosage. Is the 5.7mg really the same as 8mg due to a formulation which facilitates more efficient absorption? This very post might just shed light on that question. 


&nbsp;

Been on a consistent 2mg dose for over a week. I was mostly taking the 8mg stop signs and cutting them up into quarters with the help of a pill cutter. These pills often crumble easily when using anything less suited for the task. Since I'm using a Sunday to Saturday compartmental pill case, I can easily store crumbs if I don't get a perfectly clean cut with the enclosed blade apparatus. 


&nbsp;

I typically put each pill or it's crumbs directly into one of the seven compartments but I will sometimes use a small amount of foil for the more pulverized of the bunch. This is to prevent the dust from disappearing through the cracks in the clicking door-like covers and other unforseeables. If I had strips instead of pills, although I've been known to stick strips straight into their respective compartments, I almost always wrap them in a small folded piece of foil. To protect the strips from light and localized atmospherics.


&nbsp;


Well, about an hour and a half after my dose, 1/4 of a 5.7mg Zubsolv, I feel fine. A little buzzy too, I don't know if I'd actually call it a buzz, but like I said - buzzy. Yeah, a light buzz seemed to come on stronger for a brief moment. It has some legs.


Point is, maybe this stuff really does absorb more efficiently or perhaps it is stronger. Maybe there's another factor at play here.

&nbsp;


As many here are aware, Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. Once you go above a certain dose, it doesn't feel any stronger the more you take because it blocks itself due to the way it goes or stays in our receptors. I'm sure that this explaination overlooks something in brain chemistry. Such as how certain doses promotes the body to convert or produce ""norbuprenorphine"".


Not sure of the signifigance of that very last part but I do *believe* it has something to do with endorphins.

&nbsp;


What I am sure of is that (assuming I'm not in WD from shorter acting opis) when I take more than 4mg of Suboxone I feel a little nauseous. That sometimes when I take a 2mg I get strongly energetic and it lasts all day. I feel a kind like it came on faster and stronger than when I take more than 3mg in general. Not 100% sure but based partly on this, I don't think I want to take more than 1/4 of a Zub in the future. 


&nbsp;

A critical part of today's test is not to re-dose on the zub or regular subs. Simply ride it out. My hypothesis is that I'll feel fine at work for my whole shift all the way up until bed time. I suspect that the zub chemistry will contribute to a good night's sleep. That it won't run out of steam early, it might not have ""legs"" in a few hours but all will be well and energy levels will be normal.


I do feel someting right now... I gotta keep an eye on this sensation, see if I feel this way next time I take a normal sub of the same dosage.

&nbsp;


Best case, as I said the day goes by and I get a good night's sleep.



Worst case, it doesn't last the whole day and I somehow get really yawny. Unlikely for a multitude of reasons, at least it wouldn't be due to any form of WD. 


&nbsp;

Hopes. I hope that the stronger sensation I'm feeling doesn't result in some unplanned after effects or symptoms. Like a withdrawal. I also feel compelled to research what the deal is with Zubsolv. It is necessary for me to find out everything possible as I am worried that this formulation could derail my taper plan. I must know more in order to ensure I'm doing everything possible to avoid more discomfort than is necessary if and when I continue to taper lower.",1532198457.0

Nearly OD'd and quit, thought I'd learned my lesson. Around my birthday last month I got hit with a wave of depression and linked back up with the dealer. Have been slipping and sliding off and on now for several weeks until this past Monday. 

It was a day to day struggle this past week keeping the thoughts out, simultaneously telling myself this is a road to nowhere good one minute, then rationalizing the next. I'd stayed good this whole week, but I had left the door ajar by not deleting the dealer's contact from my phone. He calls this morning and my heart sinks as I see his number. I literally answer without any plan or thought in place of how I was going to handle it. He asked me ""what was up?"". This may sound really cliche but it almost felt like a moment suspended in time. I was stopped dead in my tracks, torn between avoiding a lonely boring Saturday with an easy short term fix, and doing what I knew needed to be done. To my now shock, I just started talking and said ""yeah man, I just need to quit, it's not good for me. Nothing personal. Take care and don't expect to hear from me again"". He said he understood and hung up. I stood in shock for a moment of what I'd actually just done. Then before any good could be undone or I could leave myself an easy out, I systematically erased any way for me to contact him, or him to contact me from my phone. (I know technically he could one day call me from a new number, but it was the best I could do and I told him he wouldn't hear from me again, so I think he will hopefully respect that and not contact me from different numbers down the road).

So I share this not hiding the fact that it feels good to revel in a personal victory, but also hopefully as encouragement to others out there struggling. Of course it's not a battle that is won in 30 seconds, but you do have it in you to make massive decisions that can alter your life within you. Much love, fam. ",1532197461.0

There is nothing else in the pills, no acetamenophin or anything like that, just straight hydromorphone. My other question is how much should I take? For comparison, I've been trying like hell to keep my tolerance down, so I've been doing between .06 and .1 grams of H. .06 to stay well, .1 to get off with a decent nod. How much hydro would be comparable to that? I shoot my dope.

Really scared.,"What’s up r/opiates? I have been out of rehab (for the 11th time) since November of last year. I was on Drug Court when I first got home and only by the grace of God got off of it and received non-adjudication probation. 

The first thing I did when I knew I didn’t have drug tests was get some Suboxone filled from my left over prescription. Sweet RELIEF. I knew that I had sold my sole, because I didn’t have the money to stay on. 

I paid my doctor visits and paid for everything else, allegedly, by selling drugs. Mainly Suboxone. 

Fast forward to now after going back and forth between 2 doctors I’m virtually out of Suboxone and I don’t know what to do. 

Opiates are the only drug that I ever was highly addicted to. I’ve been clean off Heroin over a year and all other opiates 11 months. I have used other drugs within this time frame, but no opiates other than Sub.

My question: What the hell am I going to do about the cravings without Suboxone and knowing that I have nothing blocking my receptors?

I have school aid coming (cash) and I started taking my psych meds again. I’m just out of it and hope I don’t relapse. 

From somebody who has been on and off Suboxone/Subutex since I was 18. If you are considering Suboxone. It has BAD side effects.

- COMPLETE loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, inorgasmia and it’s super hard to pee. Your dick is basically useless.
- Sweating like a French hooker. Perspiration.
- Complete lack of interest in hobbies, money, girls, music and friends
- Fatigue and tiredness. 
- Loss of appetite

Suboxone doesn’t give you any buzz and makes your dick completely stop working JUST so you won’t crave opiates. Sacrificing your dick because you don’t have will power.

Honestly after reading over those side effects I’m glad I’m turning a new page in my life. I’m going to get some Kratom and Benzos and just tough it out I guess guys. Wish me luck.",1532181590.0

Quick question relating to Oxy. 

Recently I have been having a few issues. (End of a relationship/money issues etc) 

I know these issues aren't finite and things will always get better. Alot of opportunities, changes in direction etc

This may sound like a stupid question, but as I  have a decent Oxy supply, I have turned to them and of course in the moment, things definitely improve.

Is this the start of a dangerous road trip?

When I was a freshman in highschool they gave me unlimited 10mg hydrocodone's for the pain, but I didn't like taking them and stopped after a while.

A decade later and good luck getting any painkillers. I see a physical therapist twice a week, a chiropractor once every other week, massage therapy, etc. Which overall helps a TON, but I still get breakthrough pain that gets so intense that I'll sometimes black out when walking home (anyone else ever have this?). I went to a doctor several times and was told I'm too young to have back problems so no MRI for me, and I get 20 Flexeril a YEAR.

Well that obviously isn't going to cut it when twice a week I have to spend the evening laying flat out the ground to help the pain, and eventually the back pain turns into a migraine and I'm pretty much done for the day. I'm in my fucking 20s and planning a wedding while lying on the ground in pain regularly, and this is how I am supposed to survive??? When I'm about to marry the love of my life, and all I can think about is how I just want it all to end. I just want to be able to live a life worth living.

So no doctor will even take me seriously or prescribe anything (especially after mentioning that CBD lotion helps me a TON, and I'm in a legal state). Ok, well I'm not ready to give up on life, so I've been trying every muscle relaxer and opiate and NMDA antagonist under the sun to help bring me some temporary peace. MXE was a godsend, but that's gone now.

Of course all this shit is illegal and expensive, so now half my paycheck goes to buying packs of 20mg Roxicodone that I sometimes take at night to function. I regularly volunteer at a needle exchange and standing for hours really hurts my midback, so the other night I had to take 60mg over the evening just to be able to sit on the couch and plan my own wedding. That's almost $100 in pills, depending on your source, just for an evening of feeling ""alright"". Are you fucking kidding me?

I've never used heroin or injected anything, nor am I trying to cure opiate withdrawals. This is just how my body is. These are the cards I was dealt. And America's solution? Go buy pills from your local neighborhood drug dealer and hope it isn't fent! But the price is insane! Oh, but heroin is cheaper... Maybe I could just switch to that and be responsible like everyone else thought they could? 

It's fucking ridiculous, and I know I'm preaching to the choir but it seems no one else has a fucking ear to listen anymore. All I want to do is live my life without being immobilized. I just want something to look forward to besides the end. I want to love and live, without squinting in agony.

Edit: I do use a Kratom tincture regularly and it does help immensely for the constant dull achy pain. Getting an MRI is my next step, but I know that I can't get anything from pain management because I'll test dirty on the UA because I use CBD/thc regularly for pain. 

A while ago I sent my mom, who has horrible neuropathic pain, some medicated lotion and it helped her Sooo much, but then she popped dirty on her urine test and got a strike. So now she can't use it again and is back to opiates.",1532132114.0

If you could help me out here, I would be immensely grateful!**  

**Okay, here goes:**  

1: When the high is 'on', is there any noticeable difference between snorting, injecting or smoking it?  

2: Once addicted, did you feel high at all, or did you just feel normal and no longer sick?  

3: What does getting high from an injection feel like (the come-up) versus snorting, smoking?  

4: How often would you have to snort it, inject or smoke it in order to not get sick? Is five-six hours correct?  

5: If you happen to be a rather skinny, five feet tall woman, how much would you use per dose, you think?  

6: What does heroin feel like to you? How did it interact with your personality, memories, feelings, etc.?  

7: Was the first time you used heroin different than all the other times?  

8: After the first time, was it very hard to resist taking more?

We stayed close throughout the 16 years we’ve known each other. His addiction has been pretty bad for a couple years now, and he’s turned into quite the scum to be honest.

March of 2017 I was using one of his connects for whatever reason. He came to pick up my $250 and I didn’t see or hear from him after that. Until last week when I ran into him and he acted like it was all fine and dandy. He didn’t even respond when I text him about it later that day. Alright then, I guess we’re just rug sweeping.

He asked me today to get him some dope. Yea no problem I’m getting my own. But then I thought, wait, he doesn’t even feel bad about still owing me. Does he think I’m too weak to take the money back? I text a couple friends who knew the situation and they both told me that I had every right to keep the money. So I did. I did leave him with what was in my dropper, a shot or 2 worth. He’s blocked, but I was gonna unblock him in a couple days to tell him we can just be even now and that I will actually help him next time. I know he still needs me because he’s clearly burned all his current bridges. Sorrry this is so long I just can’t help but feel guilty and I’m wondering if it was wrong to do that?

Without getting into toooo many details I generally base my decision on if I like a product based on taste, how “clean” or “clear” the trails are, how smooth Jt burns, and it’s effects... obviously. 

I’ve had some friends who shoot say they have really bomb stuff but when I try it and smoke it I find it to be not very good at all. 

Idk much about shooting but when you melt it down and suck it up through cotton or other filter is it possible that given most impurities are removed that if you’re shooting it you can’t really gauge how good the product is at least in terms for someone who smokes because your shot is essentially always going go be more or less pure heroin? 

I’m not sure if I’ve really articulated or explained my question very well or if I got any facts or info wrong about shooting or the process of shooting I apologize.

On a side note, for both smokers and shooters, how do you gauge the quality of your product? 

In my region black tar is what’s widely and almost only available which from my understanding black tar is inherently less pure due to the conversion process used. But i still seem to come across some quite pure stuff for what it is that gets the job done. 

Are other forms of heroin able to be reliably smoked? Ivd been told smoking China white is a waste and ineffective and the one time I tried to smoke it didn’t work out very well. 

All I know is there’s nothing that ruins my day more than spending my last bit of money on garbage black that burns like shit, taste like shit, hardly gets me well and gives me a headache. Drives me fucking crazy....

Anyways I'm a grown ass man... and throughout all my partying, alcoholism, benzo fueled, weed smoking, extasy popping, shroomie madness.
I've never had bowel issues. Let me clarify that by saying, yes the occasional bout of constipation with the opiates, and vice versa, with the drinking.

Fast forward 10 years, into full blown opiate addiction. I'm now 32 years old. I've cut out most if not all other drugs, mainly because it's hard enough paying for a full blown maintenance of opiates. And if I'm honest, I really could care less about all the other stuff now. Probably has to do with the brain and receptors gone to shit and rewired.

Anyway, back to the point... and I've got to blame this partly on the fent problem that's leaked into every crevice and corner of the dope and press pill market nowadays. And partly on my addiction and chronic pain from a really bad car accident when I was in highschool. But withdraws now, have become so debilitating that I can barely move because of my back and neck pain, and general will to want to die (not really, just the feeling). So to the point I'm trying to make (sorry I swear it's comming, couldn't stop it if I tried... literally lol)   I'd wager to bet, that in the past month alone, I've seriously shit my pants, about 4-5 times, as well as shit in my bedroom trashcan for lack of being able to make it more than 5 feet.(thank god its fairly large, and always always has a bag in it, with a backup nearby)  Oh yeah, and I've simultaneously power washed the entire face of the toilet tank/bowl, and projectile vomited into the tub, for lack of a better option. Which also puts me in this weird, contorted way of sitting... also murder on my back, especially while throwing up and involuntarily flexing every muscle in my back and chest.

So, moral of the story, this really really sucks. And it's most likely time for a change. And not just in my doc, in my sobriety.... but good lawrd it's gunna be hell.... ",1532072617.0

A bit of googling will tell you myrrh is meant to have some opiate properties so I decided to give it a go. 

It's not the first time I've tried it, in the past I've tried eating in and snorting it. The former method of ingestion did jack shit and latter did ziltch except for leaving me blowing sap out my nose for the next 12 hours. Still forums out there are insisting it works snorted because it can cross the mucus membrane in the nose or some shit. 

I need something so I'm willing to give it a go again. The last time didn't work, maybe because I couldn't get enough in, I needed a way to consume more. Then I had a bright idea, my nose isn't the only membrane drugs can pass through. So I grabbed a 5ml syringe and my mortar and pestle and crushed up a bunch of myrrh to a fine powder and mixed it with water. I asked my partner to give me a minute of privacy, lubed up the syringe and booty bumped that sweet Jesus sap. I did it twice 'cause I wanted to give it a proper go. Well it didn't do anything more than it had snorted or eaten. At least I have a holy shit to look forward to.

TL;DR Myrrh is about as effective as an opiate as cheese is.

EDIT: I should mention I also attempted smoking it which felt exactly like you'd imagine smoking tree sap does. Maybe I'll try vaping crack pipe style.",1532064694.0

I have a fairly heavy oxy habit of roughly 90-150mg/day and I haven’t done heroin in at least 4 years. Last week I picked up 1/2g (ecp) cuz my guy was all outta blues and wouldnt be getting anymore for awhile so if figured I would make life difficult for myself and start sniffing dope again. The shit only gets me high for about 30 mins then wears off, I don’t start feeling sick or anything it just has no legs. The obvious answer is that it’s got a bunch of fent in it which doesn’t surprise me. Seeing as how 90mg of oxy throughout the day keeps me fairly high. I was really surprised that this H wasn’t really doing the trick. It’s got a great rush and makes me feel really euphoric but it wears off really quick. I’m doing WAY more than I feel like I should need to be doing, pretty much blowing half a gram a day if not a little more. 

Is this just par for the course here?? I would think a moderate oxy abuser would be getting high for way longer than 30mins a time off half a G a day, or am I being too optimistic? It has no vinegar smell to it at all really and almost tastes sweet. I don’t really catch a vicious nod off it unless I blow a lot (don’t want to either, that scares me) but I’m having to go blow lines way more often than I thought I would.

Am I just getting shitty dope? Like
I said it’s been YEARS since I’ve sniffed heroin so I was really thinking o was gonna feel ripped all day off a few points but I’m finding myself sneaking off to the bathroom at work multiple times a day and taking bumps/lines all night long before I go to bed.

Lope and kratom keep most of the symptoms at bay, aside from the occasional sweats or chills and tightness in the legs (any of these symptoms last ~20 min max at a time), but the worst of wd for me is probably 90% mental. Even without the kratom, I get nothing like most of you talk about. (NEEEEEED the immodium though!!)

I've seen people cry about wd after a week bender, and I get that everyone's body is different, but Ive been going pretty steady for 2 years doing 120-180mg oxy/day with 10-60 days on, followed by 3-7 days off.  I was sober for about 3 yrs prior to starting again in '16, and even with my previous habit of 80mg opana/day (god I miss those things), I don't recall any horrible wd from that go around either. Even weeklong binges of ecp when I couldn't get my stop signs(never longer than that, that I remember) would leave me feeling ""fine"" in the days following. 

My last re-up after a 3 day break was 150 30s on 6/17, ran out this past monday, and I've slept like a baby every night, worked 10 hour days doing a highly demanding/ high stress job (I manage a $50M/yr inside sales office), and feel physically fine aside from mild depression and intense cravings. 

Maybe it's because I'm a closet user and CANT show signs of being sick at work or at home? Because I stay busy all day? Maybe I'm still considered a chipper since I have up to week long breaks every few months and it'll eventually catch up to me? I would have surely thought it would have happened by now, though. 

I almost never get more when I'm at the ""worst"" of my wd, so maybe my body/brain doesn't connect the blues with making me feel better?

Anyone else this lucky?

(And before anyone says it's because I'm doing presses lol, I assure you they come straight from the pharm and I've been in the game long enough to know even when they don't come from my normal CVS pickup)

I've known about this sub for months. I wish I'd posted before the media caught wind of it. :-(

im a disabled single parent (if I described my specific physical condition, I'd be easily recognizable to anyone who knows me irl bc I have a relatively unique collection of stuff going on, so I won't go into detail) chronic pain patient. I've been on opioids for over a year now. of course, the inevitable has happened. my body has built up a hell of a tolerance. its so hard. I'm barely surviving in any sense of the word, financially (not like I can work, no child support), emotionally, physically. ill be in pain until the day I die and it feels like it's become impossible to get any real relief.  

I just would like someone or a couple people to talk to and maybe get advice from, who understand my situation. you don't necessarily have to be a chronic pain patient or sufferer yourself but I wouldn't be surprised to find that there are a fair few of us here. normies dont realize how soul sucking it is. its like trying to lead a normal life while being actively crushed under the wheels of a semi. but that doesn't need to be your specific experience. 

if you're recovery oriented, you might be better off not contacting me. I dont wanna be a trigger or anything but I'm not recovery focused. my need for a quality of life means that recovery is not ever in the cards for me. I don't wanna be made to feel crappy for that, either. its just how it is.

It does not give me the pain relief I had before that is sure.  I need to cut back that is why I switched doctors.

So first month was 

Week 1 60MG of oxy 10Mg pill

Week 2 40MG of oxy 20MG of Methadone Pill

Week 3 20MG of oxy 30MG of Methadone Pill

Week 4 20MG of Oxy 40MG of Methadone

Pissed dirty for fent (dirty 30's me boy) they knew from my first piss test and were totally understanding as I did not know and I said let's keep going down... The Doctor called my wife and let her know I pissed dirty and she covered for me.

Week 5 10MG oxy 50MG methadone

Same week 6

Week 7 and 8 

5MG oxy 50MG Methadone

on week 7 as of tomorrow and life is ok but my back pain is terrible.

It started out and she was actively using. I figured it out right away. By then I had feelings for her and tried to be there for her and encourage her to quit. Its been a roller coaster. I heard a lot of lies and learned alot about what addicts are capable of. 

I guess my patience paid off and she has been clean for several months now. 

It has been great.  Really great. 

I'm still kind of haunted by the idea that this sobriety will be fleeting. She's used opiates for the better part of a decade. In that time, she's been clean before but it didn't last. 

Although she's lied while using she's open about things now. It's scary to have learned how much of an addict she really was.  It's shocking to me as someone who never had a problem like this how much the need for opiates makes a good person do bad things.  She's lied, manipulated, and took advantage of many people to feed her habit. At the same time, she was the victim of at least one  really bad person. 

Also shocking to learn that in addition to being an opiate addict she's heavily used coke, crack, and meth, but for shorter periods. While with me I recently learned that she was hooked on Xanax too.  What is really surprising is that she never switched to heroin even though she would go through $300 of oxy in a night. She has a high tolerance for withdrawals I guess. 

I don't really know what I'm asking here. 

I'm so invested in her and I'm afraid that all of her progress can be destroyed by one bad decision. I have alot of anxiety over it.  

For her part she says now is different. She doesnt think about using. She's happy. 

I believe it but still sometimes feel like I'm waiting for that relapse. 

What do you guys think?  Is there anything I should be doing?  I know people do stay clean and I know relapses are common. It's hard for me to find peace with all of this uncertainty.

Back then it was really easy for me to use opiates and stop but it became increasingly difficult for me to stop using the more I used. I live on the west side of the USA and down here there’s pills percs,vicodin, black tar heroin and fake blues which are basically fake mboxes with fent in them. I would use whatever I could get my hands on. One day I had no money, or any way to get money, I’d already borrowed or sold whatever was left of value I had so I pretty much stayed home sick as a dog all day until a friend reached out and said he had 4 suboxone strips he could let me have. I’d tried subs before but they caused a horrible precipitated withdrawal so I was weary but I accepted. This time I took my first strip over 12 hours since my last shot so the suboxone provided relief and kept me well, well into the next day. That what’s when I decided it was time to clean up. I’d tried quitting many times before but never got too far. I halved my dose every day from 8mg to 4 mg to 2 mg and so on until I was able to stay well for almost an entire day with only .25 mg of suboxone. This process was surprisingly easy and painless after that I decided to jump off the subs. I found it a little hard to sleep but nothing too bad I went for a long walk then took Advil PM and was able to pass out. My difficulty sleeping kept me up some nights but I was proud of myself for being clean after many years of abuse I finally felt what being sober was like again and it kept me going. Fast forward to today I’ve got my own place, a good job, a good amount of money in the bank, better mental health and most importantly peace within myself. I look back at myself when I was using and I wouldn’t go back to that ever. My mind was just in a terrible place suicide had crossed my thoughts almost every day. I’m just glad I didn’t kill myself or else I wouldn’t be here, a happier me. Looking back quitting wasn’t really that painful with the help of the subs. I think it’s possible to quit only when you are truly fed up and tired of all the bad stuff using brings to your life. If I can get a message across to anyone trying to quit opiates it is that the hardest part of quitting is getting over the fear of the sickness which isn’t too bad at all if you taper with subs and have the right motivation. Once I was clean for a few days I started to see the world differently, many things I took for granted such as family and relationships became important. I think life is way better now that I’m not spending day in and day out using or figuring out how I was going to get money for dope. I feel like had I not decided to make a change I wouldn’t be here but here I am happy as can be.",1531993069.0

I've started to break up my pattern of once a week, then i thought ""no problem i'll just go back to once a week again"". 

I'm using codeine, which i'm lucky was enough to satiate the depression and boredom i had before opiates. Though my doses went up to 1500mg as of recently (don't get high from 500mg anymore) and started taking 2-3 times a week. Just decided to go back and the cravings/mid physical withdrawals i'm having are awful. Just figured, as i'm extracting my current codeine from the pills i bought that i've become addicted to it, and can't function properly without it.

Im currently waiting on my middle who picked up my cash at 11:30 this morning and still yet to return but says he will still come straight to me after picked up.  Ive known this middle for a few months and hes been either really reliable and comes thru quick to taking holy fuck forever.

My middle that ive come to be cool with and even friends is my main plug atm.  He delivers which is cool bc i have no ride to get to pickup so hes been cool by picking up and dropping off for me.  Ive got a few other plugs but to get anything i gotta go to them and as much as i rather do that than go thru my middle (as youll find out more as i explain later) i can only get rides only so often.

The great thing as ive said before about my dude who delivers is just that....he delivers!  But problem is is that he uses....hes got no place to stay and no job....and throughout the short period of time knowing him hes made up a bunch of excuses for his delays which sometimes take an excess of half a day if he even returns with my goods to sometimes multiple days bc of said excuses.

He basically hussles all day stealin or pullin schemes or just plain ol committing crime to support his habit.  Or he pulls a bunch of cash together and buys a bunch of our DOC tar to get his and then delivers to each person what they ordered leaving him with a pretty solid come up and he didn't even have to pay for it its pretty sick what he does.  But it does take some scheming to make it all happen and coordinate it all so i guess its cool he gets his shit for making it happen for all his people that want some.

But i swear ive never heard of a person either running out of gas so many times causing delays or even getting arrested multiple times in a month with crazy reasons for getting picked up and i would think would be jail time but somehow is on the streets again the next day.  Now i obviously know whats up like he either used my shit and needs to find a way to get more and says those reasons is why he cant make it to me. 

It sucks that sometimes i gotta wait awhile and i give him my cash to go and get and if something does go down where he doesnt make it to me for hours or days on a few occasions he has always made it right and sometimes even giving me more like an extra half or more bc he feels bad.

Thats chill but i cant help but get irritated when he lags.  I know thats just the way it is and im super lucky he eveb delivers and things have gone somewhat decently ok in the short amount of time knowing him and also that i have received what ive expected majority of the time....of course there has been times when ive gotten less or half now half later cuz of whatever shit happens.  Bottomline is i wish a had a fucken car lol cuz then i wouldnt have to wait on my homeless addict middle.

Again..knock on wood ive been lucky  and im super duper appreciative to not have homeboy walk off with my cash which ranges from hundreds of dollars to 40 for a half depending on what im grabbing but cant help but feel uneasy about it when something that takes maybe a few hours takes all day all night and then there might be some other shit that goes down causing me to get shorted.

It just the principal of the matter which in the dope game your fortunate to deal with people that got any principals cuz ive been burned and  when you give away the last of you dough and hope for getting your shit and it doesnt go down its def a horrible feeling especially when your sick and hoping and praying that your middle shows up and sends that best feeling in the world text ""here"".  Lol cant tell you how awesome that feels to get that message pop up.

Tldr: main plug is a homeless addict who middles for me cuz i dont got a car and takes forever when he goes to pick up with the cash i give him.",1531985541.0

I downloaded a black light app on my phone and turned it on and put it over some dope and it didn't turn green. The dope is in here somewhere. I doubt I'm goin to find it though.

I assume most people from whisper would go with a half to be safe initially,  how much woukd you all upcharge this, and would you tell them straight up you're charging extra for the help? Is $20 upcharge too much?  I was thinking I upcharge $10 and also pinch off .15 or so off of the sack. Is that too much?  I'm just trying to hit a balance where I'm getting mine but I'm not being unreasonable to my fellow junkie.

Ok so I had just went over to my buddies house and grabbed a couple of ounces of weed. I sell a little on the side for some extra cash and what not. Anyway i went and grabbed that and put the bud in a jar so it keeps the smell from coming out because bags are the worst at that.

I get the good as usual no problems and start to drive home. As I'm driving home I kinda notice a lot of cops and I felt as if one was following me from leaving my buddy's place because he was behind me a ways back in the second street I turned on after leaving his place. So I lose sight of him as I went down a hill and turned to avoid him then made another turn. I lost his forsure. Wasn't even sure if he was following me but I was close to my place already so didn't want to take any chances.

Anyway I drive to my next street and take a left. Guess who's right behind me? A different cop. So I'm driving normally not speeding. Stop fully at a stop sign and proceed. Now the streets are kinda not lined up at this intersection so I ended up barley going into the bike lane like ever so slightly. I keep driving and sure as shit the cop lights me up. I'm like fuckkkkkkkk.

Now keep in mind I'm on probation and not to mention my liscence is suspended. (I'm a dumbass I know i don't wanna hear it rn) so he comes up to the car asks for the usual I let him know it's suspended. He then asks me when's the last time I smoked weed in the car. I never smoke in my car so I knew the bud must have smelled. So I Tell him never he said he can smell it. I deny. He then says man just be honest with us so we can get you going on your way. I tell him I've got a couple of ounces behind me. Asks me to step out all that good stuff.

They ask me all about where I got it who I got it from if I'm selling because I had like 2 baggies. I try to cover up for my buddy but they end up taking my phone and looking through it. (they can do this cuz I'm on probation) they see I texted my plug recently and his full name in my address book. And then they ask me how long I've known him. I say a few days I just met him. Ask me where he lives again and I said I don't know the address so they go well you must have used GPS then right? Which I did. And they check my GPS his address is right there.

I just agreed with them and shit. So then I go back to my car thinking I'm fucked I'm getting arrested and violating my probation. I even am moving back to Colorado in like 2 weeks transferring my probation so that was fucked too if I get arrested or a ticket. So they have me sign some shit and tell me they're cutting me a huge break right now and I knew they were. Only wrote me up for suspension and bike lane. No possession charge. I was amazed. I could be in jail right now. They even let me drive away without a liscence.

I'm pretty sure it's because of the evidence they got against my plug they let me off like that. I call my dude right away and tell him so he can prepare.

Is withdrawl possible just from surgery anaesthetic/pain killing? (he never got prescribed any for home, so it would all be administered at the hospital which he left a few hrs after surgery) For context, he's around 4'7-4'11"" and obciously have 0 tolerance.

Is it possible for someone small and inexperienced enough to be experiencing these kind of withdrawl symptoms just from those doses? I'm just worried about him, he's like family to me and im the only person around him whos thought about this.

So I'm going to a show tomorrow that starts at 7pm. I've being doing some research but I want to make sure I'm careful. So I take a 1mg Clonazepam everyday in the morning 8/9am. It's the main thing I'm worried about at the moment. I'm thinking of doing this for tomorrow:

1mg Clonazepam @ 8AM 500mg Phenibut @ 1PM 150 (or 300mg?) Lyrica @ 5ish PM or at the door @ 6PM (Probably just the 150 though)

Show should go till 11PM, and the main thing I'm worried about since I'm doing phenibut for the first time is it not actually working the way I'm hoping and dealing with anxiety stopping me from going through with the show. (Going alone, and not crazy on concerts by yourself).

If things aren't looking 100% by 5ish, would I be ok taking another 1mg (or .5mg) Clonazepam to steady my nerves? (Or keep it handy for later that night, or is that going to end badly?)

When im going out for fun, I usually do 150mg pregabalin + 150 an hour or two later (or 300/150), and then 10mg hydrocodone or 10mg oxycodone and 1mg Clonazepam mixed in, but opiates usually dull music for me, which is why I want to try this instead. (Since I hear music is amazing on phenibut). 

All in all, what do y'all think? Dose wise, time wise, etc. Or stick to my usual routine?

What are the options for pain after quitting?  
  
I was a user for 5+ years. Started off with the speckled Vicodins, then led to hydrocodone/oxycodone/oxymorphone/hydromorphone, pharmaceutical fentanyl, and Heroin. My last stint was a 6 month binge of Tar at 3g/daily and finally quitting with the use of Suboxone. Due to my abuse, I find it very difficult to cope with my pain even after being clean for a while now (3+ months, maybe. I don't try to keep up). I've been researching options and it doesn't seem like there is much out there (gabapentin, nsaids, cyclobenzaprine, soma etc don't help).  
  
I'm currently considering yet still reluctant on using benzodiazipines for relief instead of marijuana (legally). My last encounter with the devil's lettuce resulted in an anxiety/panic attack (this was when you either got ""stress"" or ""chronic"").

So I email the poster a week ago and get nothing back until today after emailing a few question marks. They hit my line and ask if I’m still interested. Me thinking Ive finally found a plug in my own city I reply “absolutely!” And that im at work but I get off at 6 and have a 45 min - hour drive home. Me being cautious, im anxious to see how they react.. I feel like sometimes the sketchy ones will get all butthurt or try to move things way to fast.
They reply “no problem, just hit me up” 
I also pay attention to how they text.. pretty good indication of how old they are or how sketchy. Meaning do they “tALk lik dIs” or “like this” 
Do they have a signature attached? 
They had very good punctuation and replied quickly but not so fast that it made me feel uncomfortable. I get home early around 4:30 as to catch them off guard and say “I’m back in town, you wanna meetup.” That way theres not too much time to plan anything I feel like. I meet HER at a jack in the box not to far from my place (pretty nice upscale area) and low and behold its a girl!! I only highlight this because Ive never had a female plug for pills other than friends who gave me some of theirs occasionally but never that I buy from! She was super nice and drove a nice car, no sketchiness at all! ",1531964062.0

Edit 2: A pretty good amount of people have messaged me saying they were just about to relapse in reading this is why stop them. If that’s the good that came from my addiction, then everything would be worth it as long as I help save some of your lives. Please stay safe people.

We’ve had our ups and downs. I’ve had amazing times with this drug. I’ve had terrible times with this drug. Had it not been for this drug I wouldn’t have met the love of my life. Had it not been for this drug I wouldn’t have lost the love of my life. My car. My license. My apartment. My amazing job. My family. My friends. I have nobody. I have an iPhone 8 and nobody to talk to.

I have money to buy more dope. But why continue the cycle. I’m done. I’m gonna be dope sick for the next two weeks locked in my room. I got loperamide to help me and that’s it. After that I’ll never see this sub reddit again because it’s such a trigger for me. Hope you all the best. 

Some of you will go on to OD. Some of you will go on to quit and live successful lives. I hope for the latter for all of you because addicts are some of the most humble people there are. Amazing people trapped in such a desperate situation. Yes we got ourselves into it. But we don’t deserve the treatment society gives us. 

Farewell /r/opiates. Most of you don’t know me besides pill porn. But I’m getting back on the right track and taking my life back.

She woke up sweaty and desperate before dawn to rinse the spoon from the day before. I woke up too and watched. Her attempt to get well reminded me that I had left a quarter of my bag in the cooker under the bed. It was because I’d been sober for so long. I didn’t want to overdose. I did anyway, but now, that caution paid off. Now, I had something that I would most definitely feel. It was a mistake to let her know that I had a decent rinse. After all her antics from the day before, I reluctantly split it with her. Gabriella didn’t deserve it, but she was beautiful. She was my girl. She would also make my life a living hell if I didn’t share.

Even though the amount was miniscule, it was enough. I could feel it. She couldn’t though and was very vocal about how insufficient it was for her and how much of a waste it was for her to even poke herself. She never thought about the things she said to me. It seemed like she was completely unaware of how selfish she was. She had just begged me for what I gave her and wouldn’t even say thank you. You know, it’s not like I expected a thank you, but she could have just left out the part where she was super unthankful and disappointed.

“I thought you said you had a good one. What the hell was that?”

“I did.”

“What happened to it? It hit like dirt water for me.”

“Yeah? Maybe it’s because you made me give you half.”

“Whatever. What are you gonna do for us now?”

“You’ll see.” I smiled. This was my chance. As often and as terribly as she disrespected me and made me feel so insecure about my manhood, her seeing me running around strong arming and robbing and stealing and fighting for her would win her over. Her opinions would change. She would respect me. “Let’s go to Home Depot.”

We got into her green Ford Focus and drove until we parked across the freeway in a different neighborhood. Then, I gave her the plans about how it would go. She wouldn’t get in trouble, no matter what. If they were chasing me and I couldn’t get a clean break from them to get into her car, I would take the fall. I told her that before I left. She was playing Candy Crush on her phone. She didn’t seem impressed.

I put a gym bag I brought from the house under my thick hoodie and ran across the freeway. When I popped up off the grass embankment, I stood at the back of a small Chinese buffet that wasn’t open yet. My heart thumped in my chest. My breaths got shallow. Excitement pulsed through my veins and the freedom to be myself again made the walk to the front door and to the power tool aisle seem like only a half second had passed since I got out of the car. I opened the bag up and put it on the floor, filling it with the best brands of heavy duty impact drills, zipping it up and throwing it over my shoulder as I walked out.

A linebacker of a man met me about ten feet onto the pavement and asked,

“How you doing buddy? You wanna put my merchandise down and come with me?”

I dropped the bag, but I wasn’t going with him. He was tall, so my feet had to come off the ground before my knuckles could contact his jaw. The man stiffened. He fell straight back. His head hit hard with a thump that made everyone look our way. I picked up the bag and ran.

As I got to the freeway, a small black man was behind me recording me on his phone from the back of the Chinese restaurant. I was distracted by that and stepped out into the freeway without looking very well. Besides, my adrenaline was running hard. A car was about to take my life, and all I could do was put my hands over my face. Somehow, though, it missed me and crashed into the car next to it, which crashed into the concrete barriers dividing the interstate. After those cars, a Landrover almost creamed me too but swerved and flipped onto its side and top. The other lanes of traffic were less eventful, and I never looked back to see if anyone was hurt. I just made the getaway.

Up a few blocks and around a corner sitting in the driver seat was Gabriella.  I ran up to the passenger side and banged on the window with my chest heaving and the bag in my hands. She would barely look up from playing Candy Crush and tried to unlock the door from her side. It didn’t work. My door remained locked. After a minute of me frantically knocking and trying to open it and screaming that we had to hurry, she slowly reached over to open my door manually. I opened the back door and slid the heavy gym bag in the back seat before jumping in the front.

“I’m not feeling good. I need some dope.”

“What do you think this is?” I reached back and stroked the bag of loot, like a proud Viking after a successful pillage. Here was my worth. She would see it now.

“It’s definitely not dope. And what in the hell are we going to do with that anyway, Clyde? Huh?”

“Babe, we’ve got the next best thing.”

“Money’s the next best thing. You’re telling me that bag is full of money?”

“We’ll have money soon.”

I had her drive us back to the house and used her phone to take pictures and put the drills on Craig’s List. The first one sold for 80 bucks. We made plans to meet the buyer in the McDonald’s parking lot, and when he showed up, it turned out to be a guy we both knew from the Friday evening NA meeting we went to sometimes. His name was Vic and told me he’d buy the rest of them from me for 200 dollars in the morning and give me a good day of work, if I wanted it. I told him I did. He’d be by to pick me up the next morning.

As I walked back to the car, I rubbed the four 20-dollar bills between my thumb and forefinger in my pocket. Gabriella broke her neck from the driver’s seat to watch the transaction. Things were good. Now, all we had to do was call her guy and drive to the trap. When I got into the car, she asked me,

“Why don’t you f\*ck me anymore, Clyde? Huh?”

“Why don’t I………” I thought about it. There were lots of reasons. Bi weekly psychotic breaks. Her violent episodes. Her severe depression. Antagonizing questions and statements like the one she’d just made.

“You like boys or something?”

“C’mon Gabriella. Knock it off. We got money. Let’s go get some dope. You’re being ridiculous.”

She called her guy. His name was Leeroy. We rode in silence, because for some reason, I was getting the silent treatment from her. At the trap, she said I couldn’t come in and then she took an hour to come back out. She was sweaty. Her hair was messy, and the collar of her shirt hung open like it’d been pulled and stretched by someone inside. I didn’t even bother trying to find out what took so long. I had a pretty good idea, but she seemed to be in a better mood, until I asked how much she got for the 80 bucks. Then, she showed me two small tinfoil bindles. It was a rip off. Before I could level a case about how badly she’d screwed me over again after all I had done for her that day, she started bawling. Her mascara ran. She couldn’t believe I was disappointed with her about what she got.

“I’m just giving you what he gave me.”

“Whatever. Let’s go home.”",1531950881.0

Typically we are splitting about a gram of China a day.  This past week we have been trying to taper down due to the fact she has to be clean for a UA for probation in just under two weeks.  Tapering using dope has been really difficult so our habit hasn't really gotten much better this past week.  She has a prescription for Oxycodone and we have been trying to stock up on those to get through the days prior to her UA but even a 20mg dose doesn't seem to help the bad withdrawals so we have still been using dope...  I have read that heroin can build up in your fat cells after heavy use and might be detectable for longer than the 2-4 days most online sources say.  

So my question is if anyone has experience with heroin being detectable for longer than 6 or 7 days on a UA?  We are hoping to get one more bag and only do little tiny bits when the withdrawals get too unbearable this weekend.   

Her probation officer does have on file that she has been prescribed codeine in the past and I am hoping in the worst case scenario, if she comes up hot for opiates other than oxy, that we say she took a codeine from an old script...

We are pretty concerned about this and if anyone has any feedback or advise we would really appreciate it.... Thanks!",1531940665.0

The strange thing is even though I have taken enough codeine to get a small buzz from it, which I can definitely feel, I still seem to be getting mild withdrawals.

It seems to be all americans (which is no problem of course) but the opiate culture is very different over here. We have codeine, tramadol, morphine, smack (heroin but the brown stuff you have to either smoke or inject), suboxone/methadone and fentanyl, but none of all the prescription pills you have in the US like oxys and hydros. Something that confuses me about the US is you seem to use opiates and benzos as party drugs, like lean and xanax, which makes no sense to me at all because those just aren’t party drugs here - we go for MDMA ketamine and cocaine, and personally I like speed as well but it’s not that popular where I live. Another thing is everyone hates smackheads and smack dealers in the part of the UK where I live (Isle of Man). There’s even a group of beak dealers in Manchester that go around at night just beating the shit out of heroin addicts, I think there was a vice documentary about it. Another HUUUGE difference is slang, obviously there’s going to be different slang in the US as there is in the UK but it’s the style of language that’s completely different, it’s hard to explain.

Then getting the worst depression and spending a couple weeks with night sweats, diarrhoea and all other horrible symptoms (During this time I'll try to get high on anything, like pregabalin and shit) . Life fucking sucks, I don't even enjoy oxy and benzos anymore. It's just a weeks holiday every month from my problems. 

I'm in my twenties and this is what my adult life has been. I've stopped functioning at this point , don't work or see friends anymore. Now I know what the buzz is from opiates , feeling 'normal' absolutely sucks dick. I just can't seem to break the cycle, I always end up back at square one. The only time I feel happy and excited is when I'm picking up my next script. Last month was good, I spent my food money seeing a private doctor so I could have a double oxy script . 2 weeks going hungry is nothing new for me , I haven't eaten much in years.

I don't know how to stop, I don't want to stop . But I need to stop. I tried ending my life earlier this year because of withdrawals but was found and rushed to hospital.

for me, im intimidated by male dealers because in my experience a lot of men in general just think theyre gonna get some pussy. even my weed man did this, and luckily he respected it entirely and we have become really good friends. but it was still a scary moment for me because im aware of the trouble i could land myself in, and how played i could end up.

Everyone had these feelings and pathetic views of themselves, which may have been warranted. But feelings were like that half chewed, slobbery, soggy marshmallow a small child might hand you, excited to see your excitement about their gift, about the thing they are sharing with you. So, you fake it. You act like it’s exactly what you wanted. 

That’s what it was like when people shared their feelings with me. I never wanted them to feel bad, but I also felt repulsed by it all, so I acted like I cared.  I acted like it was exactly why I had engaged them or why I stopped to listen to them, like I wanted to know about their feelings and weaknesses and all their crap. But I suppose more than anything else, if I’m being honest, I found the pitiful expressions of these other human beings trapped in the same vice as myself so distasteful and annoying, because I had the same things going on inside of me. There was no more reputation to hide my weaknesses behind. My shortcomings would no longer disappear under the invisibility cloak of a thick tar shot, and no matter how hard I tried to pretend that I didn’t, I had feelings too. 

Feelings were disgusting. They embarrassed me.   ",1531891209.0

I asked questions. She woke up. She nodded out again. Gabriella never gave me an answer. And now that I think about it, I wasn’t really asking questions. I was just repeating the number five over and over with varying mixtures of incredulity, frustration and hurt in my tone of voice. Maybe that’s why she never gave me an answer. Eventually, our correspondence evolved past my one-sided exasperation. 

“Five?.......... I mean……. Five? Really?” This had been going on for well over an hour. 

Her mouth hung open and her chin kept touching her chest. The lines in her face softened. Now, she cleared her throat and opened her eyes to address me. It was a failed attempt to speak and look sober, like she was my mother who understood the world as it was because she was an adult and I was her child who didn’t understand anything. It might have worked. Except, her eyelids got stuck, leaving them halfway open, and she croaked her words like a frog. “Yesss…. Clyde. Five. I mean. Duh.” Her forehead was slowly approaching the table cloth in front of her, again.

“What were you thinking? Didn’t I buy them, Gabriella? Did you think four for you and two for me, might be fair?” I suspected she had gotten more than the six she reported back to me with anyway, but I had no proof. 

“It was fair. Okay? You know it was fair.”

“How was it fair?”

“I don’t know, Clyde. Okay?”

“I’m just asking because you said it was fair. How is it fair for you to do five and leave me one, when I bought all of them?”

“I mean….. Well, look. You didn’t have to deal with some wannabe junkie poser boy overdosing in your house, now did you?” She knew how to get at me.

“Wannabe junkie poser boy?” 

“Yeah. Oh look. He does one bag. And OOOOOHH NOOOO!! Overdoses. Like a punk.” She was extremely high. Opiates made her mean.

“What about that? You didn’t do anything. You really thought I was overdosed and you just sat there?”

She put her hands over her head and squeezed her eyes shut dramatically. “What was I supposed to do, Clyde? Huh?”

“I don’t know. Call 911 or something. Pour water on me or slap me. I don’t know! Anything!”

“Well, I would have, but every time I woke up, I thought for sure you were dead. You know what kind of crap that is to put on someone when they’re high, Clyde? Huh? Do ya?” 

I thought to myself, sarcastically. *My sudden and accidental death in her presence at her house might be a major inconvenience.* *Besides, she thought I was dead.* *I mean, there would have been no real reason to call at that point.* 

“Every time I woke up from my nod, you were over there dead on the floor, for all I knew. You kept screwing with my high. That’s why I had to do five. Is it really that hard to understand? Besides, I don’t have anything to do with why you’re doing heroin now anyway, Clyde. You’re a man. Own up.” She slumped forward. A strand of drool formed quickly and hung from her lip and chin.  

*Didn’t you make the call and then drive us to meet YOUR guy this morning?* *Didn’t you throw the typewriter out the window because you knew today was going to be your first day of sobriety?* I thought. *DIdn’t you have the bag of clean needles that we used hidden in a heating vent, Gabriella?* *Don’t you have at least SOMETHING to do with this?*

But that’s how it went with Gabriella. She was a genius when it came to squabbling and one upping and doing everything for herself while completely screwing and neglecting me. It never mattered how obvious she’d done me wrong. It was always, ALWAYS my fault. 

I walked to the back room and opened the door. The bed was cold. Too much winter air had come in through the leaky garbage bag and duct tape patch I had put over the window that morning. I wondered if the message I had written myself was still in the typewriter. Had that warning to myself, to get it out before it killed me, come to pass? Had that imaginary balloon inside of me bust? It seemed so.  The pressure and poison had become too much, and now, destruction would come. That’s all there was to it. Besides, Gabriella had done all the dope. We had no money. Sunday morning would be an adventure for us. The adventure for me was back into crime after several lame months of sobriety, peace and honesty. For Gabriella the adventure would be seeing me in my element for the first time. She would get to meet me, the real me.    ",1531886847.0

What a blunt and depressing statement. So utterly disregarding the societal attitudes about these two substances, and admitting what is viewed as nothing less than a personal failure to most people in such a relegated way. I like him. Fuck I am him. Well i'm not, but I am.

Harold is an unassuming figure, about 45, thinning hair, dressed perpetually in a t-shirt and shorts. His wireframe glasses make him look, dare I say, professional. He looks trustworthy. His stories say otherwise, but I would totally smoke crack with this guy any day. Except i'm trying not to do that. Not trying. I am not doing it. Trying never works anyways. Addiction is something more complicated. A mixture of inevitability, muscle memory, and that alter ego which survives solely on past traumas and the remembrance of the drugs we used to self-medicate them. 

This is my fourth stab at rehab, and I have found some sense of normality this time in between suboxone strips, off label drug uses and the fact that i'm utterly broke. And i'm enthusiastic about it too, and that's proof enough that the drugs are working. I could never do 12 step programs so i'm in another intensive outpatient program, and I gotta admit I like these people. 

Harold gets half way through his day before the piano playing dickhead in the corner butts in to say he's an asshole. Well I like most of these people anyways. This riles the rest of us up. The real 12-steppers get their metaphorical crosses out of their pocket to tell this guy who falls asleep drunk with his cat under his piano that he is going to die of his disease if he can't shut the fuck up for one second. I jump in for the fuck of it, I don't really give a fuck and neither does Harold. The twice a week urine analysis ensures that we are all properly bored and partially relieved, if not outright happy, when shit finally jumps off. Even if it's just for a second before Erin, the unsurprisingly-hot novice therapist running ship today, ineffectively intervenes. It makes no difference. Despite the fact we have health insurance, we are just a group of fucking addicts. Maybe I have underestimated the truth in the 12-step dogma. 

Tonight i'm not smoking crack, no more talking to old inuit women between the McDonalds in the city and the adjacent alley while we share a crack pipe. No more needle tips in my car. I've found normality, and hi Harold. I'm Drew and I will probably see you out there some day, but nothing is set in stone, I think. It's all conjecture on this end though. ",1531886030.0

I've been doing the same batch for about a week or so and it's really good dope. I know for sure that it's not bunk or trash because, well, it gets me high as hell haha. 

Sometimes it doesn't pin my pupils, though. Or it will make them smaller, but not pinned. That's usually how I determine if a new batch is good or not. But this is weird because I'll get high as hell but my pupils won't be pinned. 

Are pinned pupils always a thing , or can you still have good dope without having pinned pupils ? I know the high isn't placebo because I nod out if I do enough. Can the lighting affect it? like I had just done a few bags and 20 min later went into a McDonald's which is really bright then went back into my car which was really dark and noticed my pupils were pretty big. Maybe I'm overthinking it? I'm just curious because this has happened with other batches too... Fire dope but my pupils wouldn't be tiny. Other times they would. But I've noticed lately that my buddy's eyes will get super pinned off of the same batch and we have the same tolerance. He has light eyes and I have darker brown eyes.

The plunger wasn't even completely pushed in and I looked at my friend and said ""I already feel this"". She knew something was wrong. She watched me for mere seconds before I fell out. I convulsed and she heard the death rattle. Then there was nothing. She had the Narcan in her hand administering it and hoping it would work. Hoping she could bring me back. I didn't come back. I turned blue as she checked for a pulse, for a breath, for anything. She started screaming as she reached for the second narcan. Shoving it in my nose as tears ran down her face. She thought she heard a breath so she ran to wake my bf up. He opened the door to me dead on the floor. An image my bf will never shake from his memories. He began compressions while calling 911. The police and emt's arrived and began trying desperately to save my life. To bring me back from the empty void. Suddenly I sat up. I looked at the faces of my bf, my best friend, a cop, and two emts. They had a look of utter shock and confusion on their faces. Not one person in the room thought I was coming back. In the ambulance my blood pressure had sky rocketed to 262/160, so they began spraying nitro spray into my mouth. Once...twice...three times. My head felt like someone had used a sledgehammer to break through my skull to my brain. It's the Narcan and the nitro they said. ""We have to bring your blood pressure down before you have a heart attack"" the soft faced emt said. The realization that I had died had not hit me yet. That was due to the pounding in my head that was unlike anything I've ever felt. As they wheeled me into the e.r., drs and nurses surrounded me. Shoving needles into my arm and barking orders. A c.t. of my brain, a chest xray, a heart monitor, blood work stat. I was ok. I survived. I came back. For days afterwards I was sore from the compressions and manhandling done by my bf as tears streamed down his face and he begged ""please don't leave me...please come back...I love you...please fight this"". I don't remember the time I was gone. It was just black and empty. The people who saved my life are left traumatized by what the witnessed. My bf won't step foot into the room where it all happened. He may never forget opening that door and seeing me dead on the floor. My best friend may never forget frantically administering Narcan to me twice and begging for it to work. 3 lives changed forever in the matter of minutes. I will never do this again. I will never hurt people I love like this again. I will never risk my children having to walk this earth saying ""my mother overdosed on Fent/heroin"". I'm just so sorry. I'm so sorry for anyone who has ever been in any of these situations. I'm sorry for the friend/relative/sig.other who has had to beg and plead for someone they love to just breathe. Nobody deserves to have to go through this. Nobody deserves to feel guilty when they can't bring them back. Nobody deserves to watch you die over one push of the plunger. This was my second time. Only my second time. Please know I'm sorry, please ONE person read this and think about it and don't put that needle in your arm. Please.

Edit: from the bottom of my heart I thank you. Each and everyone of you. This community rallies around each other other, and I feel honored to be here. Love to you all, and stay safe. If something I've said in sharing my difficult experience helps even one person change their mind about something

I need suggestions for a new book, or series of books to get hooked on like crack, or heroin, haha!  I think this time around I'd like to read more of a bio, than fantasy. Though I'm not picky. A good book is a good book ya know.

I've read the heroin diaries about Nikki Sixx, and they were written so damn good I could taste it in the back of my tongue like the first shot of the day. And I'd love something similar to it. Something about dope, and or Rockstar lifestyle. (I've also read Slash's book).

I am now reading people recommend using less water and not too much water, they suggest anywhere from 75ml to 150ml. They say the more water the more paracetamol will dissolve in it. Already fucked it up.

So I put it in the freezer for about 30min and then the fridge for about 35-40min. It was quite cold and I saw a good deal of kinda mushy/sorta marshmellow-y white stuff crystallized on the bottom. I had it cooling for a little over an hour in the freezer/fridge because I was aware I used too much water and I heard you should let it sit longer then - just nobody said how much longer. During my first filter I saw a healthy amount caught in the filter. Me, being concerned, decide to filter it again.

I put the filtered solution into the freezer for about 15min, the solution was about 120ml (much less) so I figured a healthy time in the freezer would crystallize the remaining APAP if there was any. Took it out, it was quite cold, but no crystallization. Either good sign or bad. I filter it again and have drank the final solution. I estimate I have consumed 160-180mg out of the original 243mg of codeine. Now...I figure I got most of the APAP out which is great, but I am concerned about how much gets dissolved and if that dissolved APAP remains there if I didn't leave it sitting in the freezer long enough...

TL;DR - I used too much water in my CWE and wondering how that may affect the amount of harmful APAP is in it! Thanks!

8zpkmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zpkmf/another_one_about_an_average_day/,29,https://redd.it/8zpkmf,jarr1k,Another one about an average day,"m walking down the street, not really sure where I’m going or what I’m doing. As I’m walking, I notice money on the ground. Bills, wads of bills. Tens, twenties, fifties. All at once, a familiar complexity of emotions washes over me. I’m joyful to the core of my being. My fears are relieved, my heart is glowing. I am satisfied and the world takes on a different hue. I know, I absolutely feel, everything is going to be alright. Money is perfectly synonymous with heroin to me, and heroin to life. To living, to happiness, to being who I truly am. Now I just need to get to the dope spot. I don’t know where it is or how to get there, but I’ll find it. I continue on my path with sublime elation.

I am excited and profoundly happy for a moment. I'm wrapped in the warm comfort of knowing I have money for heroin. That there will be no pain today.

And then my heart breaks. 

I don’t have a wad of money. I don’t have any money. I’m waking up. Why can’t I stay in this dream? God I hate this world. My bodily temperature is wrong. My skin is slithering, and my mind is racing with anxiety and fear. I feel disgusting - a feeling I know all too well. Last night I prayed that I wouldn't wake up today, as I pray every night. I learned long ago that god doesn't answer prayers. 

I wish I was dead. 

What am I going to do today? How am I going to do it? Even in the best case scenario, it’s going to be many hours of hell before any relief is possible. I will need whatever energy I can get for this journey. I go for my bag with all my heroin garbage in it. I take out my cooker, my cotton from last night, and two older cottons that I’m not sure if I already cooked up. I know this is barely going to do anything, but it might help a little. God I hope it does. 

I put the cottons in the cooker, add water, heat it, and smush the cottons around. I take them out and squeeze the remaining water back into the cooker. I cook the solution again, because I believe that will help kill the bacteria and prevent cotton fever. But I am not absolutely sure about that. I notice the solution is clear, as I knew it would be, but I am sad and disappointed nonetheless. I suck the solution up, and squirt a little into my mouth to ascertain its potency. I can tell by taste if it will be any good. It tastes like cotton water, with none of the heroin bitterness I was praying for. I despair, and the future pain of the day flashes before my eyes. I know it is worthless, but I shot it anyway. I actually have two working veins, the main one in my hand, and a backup one in my foot for lesser shots, which I know have no chance of giving a rush. Had I only one vein, I would just bubble the shot into my thigh, but I use the foot vein this time anyways. My body responds to the needle and the fluid entering it, and gives me a second of relief. I feel my sickness recede for a moment, but my body realizes there is nothing in that fluid that it wants, and returns to its original, partially sick state.

I have $3.50 in change. I know there is nothing to sell in this house. My parents removed all of their valuables a long time ago. They are letting me stay here for the moment, thinking I have a chance again. But I am constantly going back and forth between staying at their house and living on the street, when they catch me using and kick me out. Then eventually they see me again, and I’m scraped up from a fight, or dirty and looking like I’m about to die, and they take me back in. The cycle never ends.

I think back to the days when I had a condo downtown, money to buy anything I wanted, a high powered job, and the right to be prideful over other people. A tiny part of me cares, but the rest of me is happy to be on heroin instead. I was an asshole back then anyways, and for some reason I hated life even more than I do now.

A plan formulates. I put on good clothes, as the plan will require me to look “normal” for it to succeed. I head to the train station. I hate this part the most. The train comes, and I board. Already the sickness is starting to intensify. I sit there in extreme anxiety for the upcoming scene, which has always ended well so far, but one day could end horribly. I pray the conductor hasn’t seen me before. He comes, and thank god he is someone different. He asks for my ticket. I tell him the machine ate my $20. He gives me shit, but lets me ride. I am so relieved.

The sickness gets worse. My legs are constantly jittering. I am so uncomfortable, and the aches start coming on. I am hot and cold. My mouth and nose are running, and every couple seconds I have to lean to the side of the seat and spit down the crack. I am squirming in my seat because my whole body hurts and I can’t settle into one spot.

Forty minutes later we arrive in downtown Chicago. I am so weak. I am hunched over and it takes every ounce of my strength to move around. This is going to be torture. I exert all of my effort and move to the entrance of the train station, and to look like a normal human being. I hold a couple dollars in my hand, to show I have some money. This is where the nice clothes come in.

“Excuse me sir, I lost my wallet and need to get home. Do you have anything you could spare?”

I am so embarrassed, but it is better than panhandling. I can only do that if I’m high – you have no emotions, no shame when you are high. It almost never happens though; if I’m high I won’t bother to panhandle for more money because I’m set for the moment, my mind doesn’t make connections to the future anymore.

The man gives me a dollar, and I move to a different location in the station. After a half hour I make my $10. A little bit of relief washes over me, the hard part is over. I go to the bank, and convert the change into a $10 bill.

I make my way to the “L,” the elevated train. This part isn’t difficult at least. I wait at the bottom of the stairs for the train to come. I know the timing by heart, and right before the doors close I run up, jump the turnstile, and slip into the train. Nobody cares anyways. 

By now I’m really sick. My legs are constantly moving, my eyes, nose and mouth are watering, and I’m gagging. I am writhing around in the seat, with horrible aches and pains. I start gagging, and I throw up into the crack of the seat along the wall. I don’t care who sees me, and nobody looks at me. 

The train gets closer and closer to the ghetto. All the white people get off. The black people who are still on know who and what I am. Finally I get to the stop. I walk up the street. I am not scared, I’ve done this a million times. Nothing could stop me from this anyways, I have no fear, because nothing is as important as what I need to do. A cop drives down the street. I am the only white person around, but I don’t care. He doesn’t care either. He knows I’m just another junkie, and there is no point in arresting me because it won’t accomplish anything. 

I recognize the faces of the homeless and ghetto people I see around. Someone asks me for a cigarette. Normally I will share one, but I don’t have enough today. Sorry. I am still walking up the street. Oh good, the guys with the good dope are out. I don’t need to walk further up to the crappy spot. I know the eye contact routine perfectly. We both look at each other out of the corner of our eyes. There is a specific way you have to look at them for them to deal to you, that makes you look legit. I cross the street. I walk up to him.

“Blows.”

“How many?”

“One.”

We do the casual slip, my bill goes in his hand as the little foil roll goes in mine. Sometimes they are little rolled up foils, sometimes bags. My mind has foils linked to better dope from years of random experience, so that makes me a little happier. 

I’m beaming. I’m so relieved. But the sickness increases. My body is so excited. I am walking fast down the street, constantly gagging and throwing up and spitting. I have a spot along the highway, in the underbrush, where there are bushes and small trees hide me. I call it my “nest.” I look around to see if anyone is looking, and hop the fence. I have a little area set up between the bushes. A sign I put there to sit on, that covers the dirt. I look at all the heroin garbage, and think of the times when I was there before. 

I empty the bag into the cooker, add water, and heat. Fucking wind keeps blowing out the lighter. This is going so slow, I can hardly stand it. So fucking slow I am going out of my mind. I can’t wait to get this shit in me. I’m still gagging and throwing up and spitting, trying to avoid spilling the dope as I retch. I drop the cotton in. I draw it in the needle and note the color. Thank god it has some brownish color. This could be good. Unfortunately I only have the crappy needles from the needle exchange. They are large gauge and I don’t have any large gauge veins anymore. Being able to buy a bag of 31 gauge from the pharmacy is a major luxury. So close to this happening, so close.

I slide the needle in my vein. It is on my hand, in my finger. It is a tiny blue line, as wide as the needle. I am an expert at shooting up after all this time, I’ve never met anyone who could shoot veins as small as I can. I take pride in the fact for a moment. 

I get a draw. The blood swirls into the needle, and makes a spiral that I find incredibly beautiful. Yes! This is it! I have to push the plunger in very slowly, since the vein is so small and I don’t want to blow it. 

It’s in. The wait for the rush is heaven in itself. I’m happy for the sickness, for the pain I’m in. I’m so happy that I went through hell today, grateful for the torture, because it will make this so much better. For a moment I’m still sick, but it doesn’t matter because that moment is filled with peace and solace, in anticipation of the coming sensation. 

The rush hits. “Euphoria” is but a sliver of the entirety of the experience. A black and white description for a rainbow of vibrant colors. A divine sensation of peace and happiness and pleasure and joy and comfort and appreciation and love and dreams washes over me. The most profound change occurs instantly. I feel clean. Clean. Clean in mind and body. In a split second, the physical and mental anguish I was in has completely disappeared. My body and mind are normal and healthy. I am so clean. 

My life, truly, exists in two timelines. One is the disgusting, horror filled, agonizing, indescribably horrible living hell between shots. The other is the heaven of the rush. As the rush hits, the consciousness of myself which lives only in the rush timeline awakens. It remembers the points in time of every rush it ever had as a continuing stream of consciousness. The interim periods are like a hazy dream. This is me. The real me. 

A tiny voice echoes in the back of my head. It reminds me of the pain that will occur later tonight. The hell I will soon be experiencing again. I have no plan, no way to get money tonight. I could go beg or scam again, but I won’t. I don’t know why, I just won’t. I will spend the night in withdrawals, unable to sleep. Writhing and moaning and wishing I were dead. Watching the clock tick minutes, which feel like hours. I have no idea how I will get money the next day either, I will have to steal or beg or borrow or scam. Maybe one of my dope buddies will help me. No. They never do. I’m always scared that someday I won’t be able to get money for two days straight, and then I’ll be too sick to be able to move to scrounge something up, and I will be stuck in cold turkey. Well, not that scared. I can make something happen. I always do.

I shut myself up. Shut up. Who cares about this shit. I am sitting here in my real consciousness. I’m alive for real, the rest is just a bad dream. I’m going to enjoy this time. This time of life. I am an expert in living in the moment.

My life is nothing but moments.",1531864966.0

Coming off an opiate and trying a new one from the pain clinic. Also Benzos are involved with the process.,"I have been on Hydrocodone for about 3 years now. I take two 7.25s a day. One when I wake up and one when I go to bed. I went to a new pain clinic the past week because mine closed down. I am only 25 years old and the doctor there does not want me to stay on Hydrocodone because of my young age. She said to me what will I do when I am 55 if I keep taking the hydrocodone. 

So the doctor wants me to taper myself off hydrocodone and completely be off of it before I start the new Opiate. The new opiate is a patch called Butrans and you put it on once a week and wear it. My concern comes in here, I am also on Clonazepam and I have been on it for 7 years. I only take a half of a 0.5 every morning and every night. My concerns are is the Butrans patch going to be life threatening to take with the Clonazepam? The nurse practitioner and the Doctor there both approved it but I am also highly sensitive to medications. I still get really big buzzes off of the 7.25 hydrocodone I have been taking for 3 years.  


Also I am mainly wondering how hard will it be for me to taper off the Hydrocodone? I am not experienced in opiates whatsoever so any advice and input would be so greatly appreciated. Also I have no clue why she took this route to take me off what I am on now and put me on another opiate. I have no clue of her reasons and things like that so please don't tell me I am stupid and stuff over it. General help would really be appreciated. Thank you all so much for you time. ",1531861946.0

8zojxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zojxx/on_reserves_suboxone_shit_post/,5,https://redd.it/8zojxx,sloan_fitch,On reserves (Suboxone shit post),"Bought three stop sign 8mg pills the other day to be added to my current supply. However, I somehow misplaced it. Not sure if I deliberately placed it in a place I normally don't or if it's lost as opposed to misplaced. 

&nbsp;

Two days ago I went to take count of what I currently had. After dosing 2mg, I had just three days worth left if I stayed on that dose. After looking around on the floor and surrounding areas I did manage to find two more 2mg pieces so I added those to the daily pill case.


So now I had five days worth at 2mg. It appeared a rapid taper would likely be in order. 


&nbsp; 

Options, options, options... hrmm well Tim did hit me up late in the weekend asking if I had subs, I told him I'd check but that even in the best case I apportion my dosages days in advanced. Any deviation any loan that isn't paid back in time really fucks my shit up. Hence my reluctance to loan out a couple of subs. Two subs for this friend would literally last two days. Maybe one. He is very unlikely to cut them in half. 

Those same two subs would last me eight whole days with n doubts as long as I don't misplace them, which I actually did misplace. I couldn't guarantee being able to help Tim but I surely would look and that's roughly when I discovered that I had no fucking idea where I put the three subs I just bought days earlier.

&nbsp;

The silver lining; my sub connect says they're available later or tomorrow. I thought she ran out of subs because she only sold me three instead of four when I last saw her but she also seems to restock on unpredictable intervals. She says she gets a script but I think at least half the time she's buying them elsewhere and flipping them. I don't really care if she pays five bux and charges me ten. As long as I'm getting the going rate and not getting beat over the head I'm a happy camper.

&nbsp;

I really hope I find those misplaced subs so that I don't have to go trekking across town to get two more. So far I feel fine with just 1mg in me, but most people who quit subs don't feel symptoms until day three. So it's conceivable that I won't feel any strong negative effects of lowing my dose until day three. From what I've read, if you cut your dose of subs you'll still get relief from WD symptoms when you take your dose but instead of feeling 100% for 12 hours you might feel 100% for 8 hours.

Knowing that I can see my sub connect by tomorrow makes me want to take the other half of the 2mg piece that I cut in half today. Still, if I don't need it might as well see how many hours I can go through on that 1mg. Surely it can't be so easy to jump down 50%.. I'm assuming there's a delay in feeling the drop because of the fact that I've got multiple days of half-life built up.

&nbsp;

I wonder though, if someone is on 2mg of subs and they just drop to 1mg.. like I said I'm assuming the person might not feel it on the first day and when they start feeling symptoms, they won't feel them for at least a few hours after dosing. 

**If someone was to drop from 2mg to  1mg... how long til they feel it? Can that person just keep taking 1mg until their body adjusts to that lower dose?**

I'm very curious to hear from anyone who has experience with any similar usage scenario. ",1531857717.0

8zoe0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zoe0h/sex_pill_samuraix/,11,https://redd.it/8zoe0h,sloan_fitch,Sex Pill: Samurai-X,"#This is a review of Samurai-X, the sexual performance enhancing supplement.

It's so beautiful outside. The wind was ferociously shaking the vegitation up until a few minutes ago. Still got some trees swaying and the passing rumble of light thunder. The sky has that magnificent dark blue - greyish monotones.


I'm glad it's like this outside, the rain is inconsistent but I don't see any signs that the sky will clear up just yeat. Perfect excuse for me not to get off my ass and ride my bike. This is not to say the weather stops me if I want to get going. If I had work right now and there was a torrential downpour, I'd suit-up and get on my awesomely outfitted bike. 

&nbsp;

I kinda tried out a dick pill the other day, Samurai-X. Not to be mistaken with the Japanese anime OVA that chronicles how Kenshin got his name among many other things including his cross-shaped scar.

So anyway, what makes these pills unique is they have all the usual ingredients - it's more like a supplement capsule. Anyway, contains nitric oxide/l-arginine, horny goat weed and other stuff I can't remember. The product I bought was Samurai-X ""special edition"", I think 8250 and the packaging says it'll work for five days.

&nbsp;

One more thing about Samurai-X. The FDA posted a warning about it, they said that there's one ingredient that's in the product that isn't listed on the box. Sildenafil - the active ingredient in Viagra. Well shit, sounds good to me. The only reason I'd say it's trouble is for the same reason the FDA says it's trouble, because it's not written on the box. Secondly, you really don't want to drink alcohol on Viagra or it's generic conterparts. So not knowing a product has the stuff in it could be treacherous considering alcohol often accompanies opportunities for sex. Thankfully it's not a pre-requisite, unless you're really ugly or your partner is. 

&nbsp;


I'm not gonna get into the ""why"" at this instant but I will report my findings. Yeah, the morning wood was more rigid at unexpected intervals for the three days after I took the suppliment. The bottle said it would take at least 3-4 hours for it to begin taking effect and I'd say that's true. This stuff might be a good over the counter alternative to Viagra if your local sex shops and delis sell it ""under the counter"". 


Good if you're in a bind or have a girl in a bind but can't get wind behind your sails. Just be sure to hydrate well and maybe don't get the 5-day variant unless you want to experience what I just did. I don't know if it's true or how it's possible to have the Sildenafil last multiple days from one capsule, this calls a lot of shit into question. Questions that are not answered thoroughly by the label or search engine queries. 


&nbsp;


The adverse effects didn't occur until night 2 or 3. During the day at work I was smoking the shit out of my vaporizer pen. Hell, I been vaping the various hash oils since I got it on Saturday. I thought my headache at work yesterday was directly related to the hash oil extracts. 

You see, the first cartridge of hash oil was pretty decent stuff. It tasted like weed but was labeled ""Tangy Mango"" or something like that. The second and third cartridges I purchased, I got from a someone else. They seemed good, the packaging looked okay and all. The main difference between the first one and these two is that these two has a lower viscosity liquid within. 


The bubbles in thick hash oil barely move wheras this thinner stuff was more like liquid or a thin syrup.

&nbps;

A coworker told me that the person who sells the two more recent hash oils I bought gets stuff that's not super great. That as you get to the bottom of the cartridge the stuff turns brown - not necessarily bad but he claims this doesn't happen on the better cartridges he's been buying.


The first day I had that hash oil at work I had to smoke it at work - such fun. I scaled back my consumption after the first day, but yesterday I was using one of the newer ""lower quality"" cartridges. I noticed that no matter how long I hit it, that I didn't get the compulsion to cough my lungs out as I did with the higher quality hash oil.


Are there any useless fillers in this hash oil? Is it just less potent? Maybe a combination of the two - hence why I initially assumed that my increasingly pounding headache was related to this.

&nbsp;

As the pounding headache got worse, I ate a meal then sat down to watch som SciFi. After over an hour it didn't get better. When I finally went to bed I had a pounding headache -- the pounding of whihc matched my pulse. From 2-6am I barely slept if at all. From 6-9am I may have slept a tiny bit but I remember being awake. Unable to get comfortable, if I didn't know any better I'd wonder if I was experiencing a withdrawal symptom.


Sore muscles everywhere, but for some reason if I slept on my side, a position that has proven it's worth on days when I couldn't sleep - my arm would fucking hurt. Like a string of muscle would just cry out ""I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.. just reminding you that you do have an arm and this arm is going to keep signaling."" Lay down flat, put that arm in a particular position and the sensation is masked but the cold air is not. 

&nbsp;


I don't know what it was but the tossing, turning, hot, cold and sore muscles were accompanied by more erections that I'm accustomed to when I'm feeling sickly. So then I made the connection and said to myself, ""maybe it was that Samurai-X suppliment and not my weed vape."" Maybe there was an interraction between the two but who knows.
Sex pill (supplement) review 
&nbsp;

Bottom line, although Samurai-X does not state that it has Sildenafil in it's ingredients it may still prove useful to some who don't have the time of ability to get a Viagra script. Prescribed or not the active ingredient does not mesh well with alcohol at all, in fact doing so would give one the same symptoms I encountered plus some stomach sensations that I was fortunate enough not to experience. Kinda hard to have sex when you're feeling dizzy and have pounding headache.



One more thing, taking something that has Sildenafil in it while also having a heart condition can be super hazardous. A doctor knowing this would probably avoid prescribing it to someone who carried a high risk factor. Considering you can get Samurai-X at many bodegas, I think this post could be of benefit to some of you since I couldn't find a solid detailed review on the product elsewhere.

&nbsp; 

Days one and two it did not interfere with my sexual function but if I were to get laid yesterday the headache most certainly would have. I'm really glad I did not have any further sexual rendezvous after the weekend ended.

Oh and finally, I did manage to get rid of the pounding headache when I finally copped three hours of sleep after 9am. Not 100% but enough that I could get up, drink my coffee, hydrate with some water and pull it together. I feel much better now, still some lingering effect but nowhere near as bad as last night. I am currently refraining from smoking my vape pen and if I do it'll be used sparingly today. On future days when I have no weird supplements in my system, perhaps then I can binge vape to determine if that was the cause of my headache but I'm already pretty confident it was the sex pill.

8zo5v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8zo5v5/chemical_peace/,4,https://redd.it/8zo5v5,FilmCroissant,Chemical Peace,"Fuck, yet another day of hanging on by a thread. I wake up begrudgingly, unwilling to move or exist, yet shocked into motion by the first portents of sickness. My skin feels icky as though it were trying to peel off but is forced to remain stuck to my body. The first stomach cramps are manifesting and in order to prevent any worse symptoms, I collect all the cash I can find in my junked-out abode. Yawning and teary-eyed, I pick up the wallet off the nightstand which is littered with syringes, cookers, lighters, and red and brown drops; a shrine to the urban alchemy that is cooking #3 heroin.


I stumble out the door, forgoing basic hygiene and wearing a shirt that needed ironing yesterday. Day five of my binge. It is summer and the sky is clear and blue, as though the ocean had been inverted and suspended above the earth in a great dome. My dealer is still asleep as it is 8 AM and he is himself binging on crystal and benzos. My only chance to score H is The Park, a square of disheveled greenery and  wooden benches sprinkled with bird shit, as well as the obligatory rickety playground. It seems the denizens of this center of my city’s drug mythology never sleep, which means they're perfect for early morning emergencies. On the downside, they're exactly the types you’d expect to stay in parks all day, forcing down canned swill and selling stuff.

&nbsp;

I get off at the adjacent bus station and enter the park, the trees closing above to cause a pleasant shade and agreeably chilly air. The roads are covered with tiny pebble stones which make crunching sounds as I walk towards the spot through the alley. The actual drug spot is near a park bench and a kiosk, a low wall affords an opportunity to sit. Cliques of derelicts are shored up on the road, sidling towards hopeful customers and cooing promises of chemical dreams; shifty-eyed and sallow-skinned, peddlers and patrons alike. I approach my usual guy, a white guy with dreads and decent enough product.


With three bubbles, roughly 200mg each, in my pocket, I enter the nearby toilet. My works are in my backpack and I put the cooker on the shiny metal sink. Now comes the ritual, a process I enjoy at least as much as actually shooting up. I concoct a nasty sludge, dark brown with floating specks of cut, in awe of the mental gymnastics that enable me to inject this foul soup in my veins. With growing despair, I poke around for a vein. After a while, I register - dark blood shoots forth into the syringe, much in the form of a mushroom cloud rising from the smoldering ruins of your bombarded dreams and ambitions.

&nbsp;

I open the door, transformed. Normal people cannot appreciate how magical a place a public restroom can be. In my desperate sickness I didn't appreciate the quaintness and harmony of the park. The gentle trees joining limbs to shield the sun; the birds twittering in synchronicity with the plodding chatter of the people; a scene that lends credence to the Buddhist teaching that all is one. And in the middle of it all - a soul in search, though arrived at a treacherous chemical peace.

This weekend I purchased 0.4 of some fire tar from a good buddy of mine and 2 hours later when I was about to prep some for nasal administration it was nowhere to be found. It was his last shit from that fire batch too and what sucks is that this was 3 hours away from where I live at currently. I had asked him to save that amount for me the day before so I could pick up right before driving back home. After I made my purchase I stuffed it in my pants pocket, (the little pocket sometimes used for coins). I’ve always stored my stuff there and it is mostly always a reliable storage place. Then I went to my parents house to say bye and  ran some errands, put gas on car etc. As I was getting ready for the 3 hour drive back home I realized the stuff dreams are made of was no longer in my pocket. I spent another 3 hours looking for this shit, went back to gas station looked on the ground, went back to my parents looked all over, asked my buddy if I’d drop it outside his house, looked through my dirty ass car for what seemed like eternity and nope, nada, zip. It was such a disappointing feeling. I drove the 3 hours back home nonstop thinking where the fuck could I have dropped it.

She had beautiful, dark brown skin. She had a hard and pretty face, predatory cheekbones that intimidated and attracted me in a way I wasn’t used to. You know what I mean? Like sometimes the weirdest things about a woman can be so attractive.  For me it was that Gabriella looked so primitive and mean. I loved her cheekbones and those black eyes looking through me, but when we got back on the dope, everything softened. She was still pretty, don’t get me wrong. It just wasn’t the same as before. 

She had been smoking it before I found out and finally gave in that morning she threw my typewriter out of the window. Now, she was back on the needle and had nothing to hide, because I was using too. It was the fabled and elusive China White that people did in this part of the country. From what I could tell though is that just like the inconsistent quality of black heroin on the west coast, so is white powder on the east side of the Mississippi. That first morning we got six bags for the hundred dollars I slapped on the table.  I did one and flopped out. My lips turned blue. It had been several months since I’d done any drugs, much less a potent shot of heroin. And that’s kind of how that goes. 

When I woke up, Gabriella had done the other five bags.  She told me she thought I was dead, which made me wonder why she never called the paramedics. Calling 911 and dealing with that would have messed with her high and interfered with her shooting up the other five bags I bought.  That was obvious. To be honest, I wasn’t even irritated about her thinking I was dead that whole time while she kept getting high and letting lit cigarettes fall out of her mouth. It looked like a whole pack had been lit one by one and set on the carpet by her feet. I wasn’t mad that she had almost burned the house down, but I did want to do another bag. I was mad that they were all gone. I was mad she hadn’t saved at least one more for me, and right then, I realized I was right during those first 42 hours when I kept thinking to myself that such a beautiful woman falling in love with me so quickly was too good to be true. It was, and this was the proof. 

Somehow, her doing the rest of the heroin and letting my cold corpse rot on the floor for all she knew and the mess of emotions and lies she’d brought into my life, somehow, she made it my fault. I let her. I mean how could I say that my being involved to this degree with someone so crazy wasn’t a reflection of my own insanity and unhealthiness. It was. It didn’t mean I was happy about it, and since I was resigned to the fact that I was crazy too, I stayed with her.",1531842040.0

How many others have fallen for the scams. I know what I did wrong, don’t need bashed or anything. Just me, someone who’s always so careful, but also trust everyone, never thought I’d see my money walk. 

Fuck. And I ended up telling my girl. I didn’t want too but I needed too. I don’t know how to push the thoughts from my mind. Seriously a week or hardly using shit has fucked my mind up so badly.

I came out of treatment about 2 weeks ago after completing my 3 month program and I’m not the same person. I over think things now, I don’t confidently approach situations like I always used to, I feel like anxious now and with a low self esteem, it sucks, I know after an 11 year heroin addiction this can be expected, but it’s actually having a negative impact on my quality of life. 

One of the biggest reasons, as shallow as it sounds but I must be honest, is due to the fact that I’ve gained so much weight. I’ve always been in good shape. I swam competitively in High school and after that I just had a good frame, I really used to like the way I looked, I was very confident in that aspect of myself. I’ve started to gym now and I know that eventually I’ll feel better about this, but it’s just crazy how being heavier has effected me..

I went from poppy pods to pharms (mainly oxy, but really anything I could get my hands on) to heroin. Then I realized about 3 years ago that it was becoming impossible to maintain a normal life (job, wife, etc) and constantly use. So I tried cutting my heroin use down to chipping (on 3 weeks, off 3 weeks), but that also didn't work because I was good for 3 weeks then in withdrawal for a week, and it interfered with daily life. So I eventually quit all together, and soon thereafter entered a state of depression. Using made life miserable, but not using also made it miserable. I started using hydrocodone maybe twice per month just to quell the boredom, but even 50mg created zero euphoria and really just made me feel weird.

Enter DHC. I was recently offered 60 pills of 60mg dihydrocodeine, which is quite rare in the US. I decided fuck it - it's known as a weak opiate and whats the worst that could happen? I read up on it and a lot of people said that it's so weak, they took 400mg and it barely did anything. I was not expecting much. So when I got it, I immediately took 3 (180mg) and was very surprised that I was high as fuck. It was WAY more euphoric than hydrocondone, and I nodded right the fuck out. For me, it sits somewhere between hydrocodone an oxycodone on the euphoria scale. I then discovered that I could take only 60mg of this stuff in the morning and another 60mg later and I would have a nice euphoric glow all day with good energy. Fucking awesome. Strange, because others seem to not have the same reaction, but awesome none the less. So I went on like this for a month, knowing that I was probably going to feel like shit when I ran out. Well, that day came and I was amazed again - I barely have any withdrawal whatsoever. A tiny bit of extra body pain that is easily managed with tylenol, and that's about it. If I were to use anything else daily for a month, I would be feeling like crap for at least 3 days.

I must have some strange brain chemistry. Maybe this stuff hits a different opioid receptor besides the Mu (perhaps delta?), but it's pretty much the ideal opiate for me. It's got low enough affinity that tolerance seems to build very slowly, it's inexpensive, it feels good and it seems like it doesn't have much withdrawal.

Well last night he picks me up around 11. We park in a parking lot and finally get ahold of his dboy at around 12. By this point I’m sick as fuck. I hadn’t had a shot all day. I am broke as fuck and only had $40 to throw down anyways. 
We start heading to his dboy who is about 30 minutes away. We are two streets from the dboy when my guy says “Sorry dude, you’re gonna have to get out while I go get it two streets down. He doesn’t want me bringing anyone to his mom’s place. It’ll take two minutes” 
I agree and get out, chilling on the side of the road for a minute. Now my phone can’t make calls or texts, but it can receive texts. He knows that. He texts me about 20 minutes later saying “I have to take Dboy to Walgreens really quick. It’ll take 10 minutes and it will be worth it.” 
I can’t respond so I just sit and wait, time inching because of how sick I am. At this point we are extremely far from my apartment walking-wise and this crosses my mind. 
Long story short, I wait 45 minutes before deciding he isn’t coming back. I was stunned, pissed, sick, and confused. I start walking the hours-long walk home. I’d be lucky if I get there by sunrise. 
After about 20 minutes of walking, I get that magical call from dude. I answer almost in tears of happiness. “Bro what the fuck happened?” “Dude I’m so sorry, he had to go to Walmart because the Walgreens was closed and it took longer. I don’t see you wya?” “I started walking home. I thought you weren’t coming back!” “Bro you know I’d never do that to you. Wya I got the stuff and can come get you.”

So me not knowing really where this house was as I was fucked up on xans before we even got there, I run out the back door and running through this small path of trees to this small parking lot for like a couple small businesses. Right on the other side of the tress where I came out there was a fence that was behind a dumpster, so I sat behind the fence for what felt like 5 minutes but could have been more or less, I really don’t know. Once I decide to get up I step from behind the fence and walk into the parking lot to see where I am and of course all of the sudden two fucking cops pull into the parking lot and I’m standing there, a 16 year old fucked up kid with there lights bright as fuck in my eyes. They both get out and ask me the general questions, did you come from that party, did you drink, I told him I did and that I only had a couple beers. Then they pat me down and me “not having anything on me” ( you’ll find out later on) they call my mom and tell her to meet one of them at this academy sports that was near by. Luckily my mom answered bc they would’ve had to take me in the for the night probably if none of my parents would have been able to answer. But yeah back to the part in () once I got home I got undressed and while doing that I found that I had a Concerta pill in my pocket which the cop went right over while patting me down.

* **Clonazepam** (Ravotril, k-pin): Strong node for like 1-2 hours. Once I woke up with my head over the keyboard and the square pattern marked on my forehead LOL. More psychological than bodily high.
* **Diazepam** (Valium): I'm on it right know, milder nod with an amazing body high, long lasting, hard to keep your eyes straight for hours, people will definitely realize you are ""on something"". Totally recommended.
* **Midazolam** (No idea about brand name outside Chile): Very short half life benzo, and very strong. Immediate extreme nod (quasi blackout I'll say). Very euphoric if you fight to stay awake. Be specially careful with this combo. Midazolam can be shot, I call the mix ***slowball***. Almost fell to the ground with the needle in my arm.

I'll just take it out myself.","An old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet from the pair of shoes that made them smell so bad at the detox. At night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroin.

My nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.

“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.” Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.

“Okay. Well, aren’t you sending the urine to a lab?”

“Yes.”

“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right? You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”

“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”

“No. I won’t.”

“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”

“Yeah, I do. Get the f\*ck out of my room and leave me the f\*ck alone until you have those results! I’m trying to watch my cartoons!”

She didn’t have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him. When she lingered awkwardly to talk to me other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump.

Back home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. He brought a carnival king cake from Louisiana to the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six-piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and my dad attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my hair cut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy! You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”

Once he got back home, he told me over the phone what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We paid close attention to my erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which detects inflamation and felt relieved when it went down. My father saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled back home.

I gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt nothing but sober.

Between flights my dad called me.

“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”

“Really? How do you know that?”

“Well, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”

“Yeah. I still have it in.”

“Sh\*t! Riley!”

“It’s okay. I’ll take it out myself.”

“I don’t know about that. I think that’s dangerous. Let’s figure it out when you get here.”

“Okay. Sounds good. We’re about to take off.” I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.",1531796360.0

For now ill just summarize.

I tried evading the police the other day.  They weren't after me, but were scoping me out suspiciously.  I hit the pedal hard when I was out of their sight, and pulled into the first lot and building to hide.

It was a nunnery. Damnit. Smooth. Cops creep past scanning for my car. Pull in to far side of lot.

Of course they would. I don't belong here, 99% of males don't.

I burst into a desperate impromptu acting performance to save my freedom.  It just so happens nuns outside knew and were awaiting a delivery.  What are the chances I might sell the same product they need? Cop conversation occurs. Not what they expected. Im sure they drove away confused.

Need cops to leave and not question you? Stay quiet, smile while nuns handle the words for the most. 

I take the products into lobby, pretend I'm checking order.  Enough time for cops to be far enough away. I apologize, say I grabbed the wrong order. Ill be right back after I go to my trunk.

I met my love the next day, in the pharmacy waiting room. I was in so much pain that I just tore the bottle open and took 2 of them, Vicodin. I could barely choke them down, but I managed. The car ride home was sullen and painful.

I slowly ascended the stairs to my room, on the side of the house facing the sunrise. I figured I would try to make the best of my day off school and maybe see if I could figure out a few of the more confusing console commands for Half-Life 2. I sat in my chair, cross-legged, and spun into place.

And in that moment, I was filled with a love I had never known before and have only tried to find since, in the side alleys of cities under the purest blue skies with clouds stretching for a million miles, on a thousand plateaus. I met the friend who would never leave me, if only I could keep pace; if only I could grab his hand, just inches out of reach. I chased Him, down the nights and down the days, I chased Him, down the arches of the years; I chased Him, down the labyrinthine ways of my own mind; and in the mist of tears. And it was all worth it, I knew, and do. My manna from heaven, my light in the dark, my best friend home for Christmas, my warmest blanket on their coldest days. My friend who never leaves me, just ahead.

normally I can take a half a sub and still get high right after, not 100%, but maybe 60% which is good enough for me. 

maybe it's because i've been doing way more dope than sub recently, but when me and partner in crime decided to head to the city around 7am, I did 6 nics and felt pretty much nothing. It sucked. I actually thought I kept missing, but I think the sub really was blocking it. Just so surprising because I can ALWAYS get high after subs. I thought I was some kind of special fluke or something. But like I said I've barely been taking subs at all lately, so maybe that has something to do with it.

So this evening I go back, get 12 more nics to split. Do one, nothing. Mix up two, kinda feel it but barely and it lasts only a couple minutes.

I don't know why but it makes me so depressed to spend the money and not get high. Buying dope to begin with might as well be lighting your money on fire, but when I spend the money and miss or for whatever other reason don't get high, I just feel like such a sack of shit.

I have 3 nics left. I'm trying to get drunk and forget I have them until the sub wears off more, but I might end up just telling partner in crime to take them, because I'm probably gonna try to do them and get nothing out of them and he'd appreciate them way more.



blah.

to top it off i just realized i fucked up my chances of getting PTI because you need to apply within 28 days, and I waited too long. go back to court the 25th I think. which is also my mom's birthday. fuck me. i hate feeling like such a piece of garbage.

update: of the three nics I had left, only two still had shit in them. not sure if one spilled or partner in crime stole one, but idgaf he paid for it anyway. did the two that were left, felt it a little better, but still nothing intense and it'll probably wear off within 10 minutes. still hate myself. gave him all my empties/crumbs. who cares. might as well have just wiped my ass with that money and flushed it down the toilet for all the good it did us anyway.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/8z7302/60_minutes_legal_heroin_for_addicts_in_liverpool/

The doctor said that, in his experience, people basically mature out of addiction by chance.  If that is true, we should reduce harm, and prescribe heroin.  That apparently lowers users because it cripples the market, as well as saves lives of the users, and allows them to live normal lives.

How do you think your life would be different if you had access to essentially free heroin?  I wonder about the emotional cost the most personally.  If you can get an steady, free supply of heroin, how much a reduction in stress that would be.

Another question I have.  If you could get a steady, good supply like that, would you be less inclined to quit?

Last year, I discovered my uncle was a heroin addict, and ever since my world turned upside down. I still remember those days when I was a little kid and he never had money but still managed to buy me a T-shirt or give me something that really had an emotional value. 

I always knew something was wrong, the way my grandparents and my mother treated him never seemed to make sense, they would always hide money and jewelry, or lock it up in our rooms, he would come back home late and act crazy but innocent as I was, I never thought about it. 

Now it makes sense, but in some way, I really understand him like no one else does. I’ve seen him steal my money while he thought I was asleep, I’ve seen him ruin others life’s with his selfishness, I’ve seen him not giving a fuck about his 14 years old son just because of heroin. But I know that deep inside there, is the man that has been showing me true love ever since I was a little baby, and in some crazy way there is a insane bond between us that nothing could break. 

I just want to thank him for showing me how to learn from his mistakes, and never end up like him. While he was nodding right now, he told me that if I had a gun I could kill him right away and end everything right now, and I saw the crazy emptiness in his soul, fuck. 

As much as I wish there is some hope for him, I know there isn’t. He is never coming back and there isn’t anything anyone could do, especially me. I’m sorry if this was to depressing but I couldn’t keep this inside me, I just hope you guys do fine.

Well we got our results and it looks like I'm the problem in the situation and not my girlfriend, and its highly likely that its because of my major drug use since i was around 17 years old. So I've made the decision to get sober from all substances. 

I used to be a heavy alcoholic, drinking around a litre of vodka per day and hiding it from my girlfriend until she obviously found out, Started going to AA meetings and i quit for a long while but slowly came back into drinking all the time again as well as using oxy, coke, MDMA, ketamine and occasionally heroin for the last few years. I thought i had it under control but if i have oxy (or any drug really) I'm going to do it regardless of what i tell myself. If i can't get oxy ill just get a bottle and a bag of blow instead.

The usual sperm count for acitive sperm is 4&#37; and mine was a little bit under 1&#37;. So thats the main reason i can't get my girl pregnant. So i have a few 40mg oxy pills left, and once I'm done with those, I'm done. Done drinking and done snorting coke every god damn weekend and blacking out on liquor all the time. I just went 5 days without oxy and had some minor withdrawals so I'm not worried about that, more so of the mental cravings I'm sure i will have.   


Hopefully with all the money ill be saving from all the drugs i won't be buying now ill finally be able to propose to my girlfriend who stuck by me with my addictions. Honestly if she didn't stick by me i don't know where the fuck i would be today. We own a house, have a dog and want to start a family and its all because of her. She never gave up on me in my worst times, Stuck by me and looked after me like a child when i was going through major alcohol withdrawals. She even took off fucking work for a week so she could be there for me because she was scared i was going to have seizures.  I owe my life to this girl and its time for me to grow the fuck up and give back to her what she has always wanted. A child.   


I have a long, long road ahead of me, but i am determined this time to get sober. Wish me luck. :)",1531770229.0

I used to be a heavy oxy/hydro user, but got clean a few months ago. I've been using morphine this time around, mostly just because I can get it super cheap and frequently. My question is: how do you guys deal with nausea on morphine? I'm assuming I'm not alone in this problem, a few pals of mine confirmed they experience it as well. I had some ondansteron which helped a little but I don't have anymore. I really enjoy the sedating effects, it helps with my horrible insomnia, but even if I can sleep through the stomach issues, I wake up feeling EXTREMELY nauseous. I don't use everyday, and take about a week break off and then a week on. Someone told me that the nausea would disappear with continuous use, but I don't want to use everyday. Do i just have to accept nausea as a constant side effect?

(Followed by some present day shit from real life at the bottom that's not orphan related),"


I don't know why I feel such a strong emotional connection to this story, but every time I've read it or played back the audio version of this book it pulls on my heart strings. The admiral and his space fleet of destroyers arrive in an Alliance controlled star system that is connected by a jump point to a former enemy star system. 


Ships full of refugees are floating all over the place. The local space and ground forces have been getting scaled back thereby making it impossible for them to solve the situation. It's hot mess but at least it's not a war zone. On the main inhabited planet is a military academy full of orphaned children. The president of the planet invited the admiral to visit the academy beceause one of the orphans is a descendant from a ship the admiral served on over a hundred years ago. Admiral John ""Black Jack"" Geary has only lived for over a century because he spent a long period of time in an escape pod in a state of technologically induced ""survival sleep"". 


&nbsp;


During the time in the star system the admiral has to find a peaceful solution to the refuge problem. Upon approaching a couple of the ships it is disovered that the life support systems were over-taxed. The fleet had to immediately get to task on hooking up fresh air chutes to the ships while also sucking away the putrid carbon-dioxide laden air. It's so sad thinking of those people all cooped up on an already crowded ship. As the air supply became limited, the operational crew members had to wear emergency breathing gear. It's shitty they can't share the emergency air supply but if the crew passes out everyone is definitely screwed.


&nbsp;

All this sad shit going on but there is a silver lining - the sadness and despair is countered by the acts of humanitarian kindness that Admiral Geary's fleet immediately engage in. Geary prefers to avoid parades and public appearances but of course he had to make an exception and visit the orphans - victims of a century long war where so many parents were inducted into the alliance space and ground forces never to come back home after perishing in battle. 


&nbsp;

What you just read is a synopsis of a portion of **The Lost Fleet: Beyond the Frontier - Steadfast** by Jack Campbell. The audiobook narrator does an excellent job. This genre of military science fiction was written by a guy who knows he can make money if by writing a multi-part series. When he couldn't go any longer he wrote a few side stories including the revolution which occured in the Midway star system. 


&nbsp;

In this book series doctors can prescribe medication on an electronic device which prints out medicated patches on demand. Don't we all wish? I sometimes think about how the hypo-spray (needles in Star Trek) can be programmed on demand to administer just about any medication. Just imagine a junky with that.

&nbsp;

**It just occured to me** that I misplaced the three Suboxone pills that I bought the other day. So while looking around I found 2 more 2mg pieces. After my morning dose I had only three days left at 2mg. **Now I have five days of subs left at 4mg.** I'll most likely watch a bunch of hypnosis videos tonight to help me search my memory. 

&nbsp;

Not yet sure if I'll just aggressively taper down, buy more or get lucky and find that which I've misplaced.

Maybe 1.75mg tomorrow, down to 1.5 the following day. I know going from 2mg to 1mg might be too rapid, but I *believe* it should be sufficient. I don't know if I have the will power to just put myself down to 1mg in two days time. 

Sure hope I find that shit I misplaced. Should've secured it with certainty when I got home with it.",1531768343.0

I would just like something to watch and nod out to. 

Preferably nothing zombie related as I am not interested in shows about that. 

I’ve tried stranger things, wentworth, and breaking bad,  which people said were good but I couldn’t get into it... after watching 3 episodes (which I believe is enough to give a show time to catch my attention) 

I also have Hulu, but I can only watch that from my phone which I’m currently working on the handsmaids tale (I do not have cable so I watch that while I’m in bed) so preferably would like it on Netflix since I can stream that from my blu ray player. I can with Hulu also, but it only supports Hulu plus, & I have to wait for my free month trail to run out before I can upgrade to the plus version.

I haven’t ever gone through either, however after running out of Oxy, I’ve jumped onto #4 & I went through a transition of partial withdrawal that was actually better than when I’ve experienced oxy withdrawal ...

Oxy for me starts with muscle aches & extreme agitation, where as #4 seems to be super hot flush, sweating ... the runs ...

Oxy I’ve never ever ever gotten ‘flu like’ symptoms upon the beginning of withdrawal, which I can tolerate... I’m hoping that #4 is just that - flu & the runs ...

List of full rules and a short explanation of why they are in place.,"This sticky is in place because we are seeing an ever increasing number of members on mobile, who have never seen the rules, that are clearly visible on a computer and to explain why they are in place and clarify some things. If you have questions to ask feel free to ask them here or if you would like to privately discuss them with us hit [modmail.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOpiatesMods)
----

**1) This subreddit is 18+ only.**

> This rule is in place to ensure the longevity of this subreddit and prevent unwanted media attention if an unfortunate event were to occur involving a minor and this subreddit.

**2) NO SOURCING! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors. Specific DNMs and/or vendors cannot be discussed.**

> This one should be pretty obvious and self explanatory, but we often see people who could not care less whether or not this place continues to exist to spread harm reduction, support, and continue to save lives for years to come. Reddit has banned many dozens of subreddits for allowing, promoting, or facilitating the trading or sale of even *legal* goods. This is the number one way to lose our beloved home.

**3) NO LOCATION-SPECIFIC POSTS! Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed-- this includes neighborhoods AND cities. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources.**

>This rule is kind of an extension of the above sourcing rule, because when a location is named it inevitably leads to people from there talking about meeting up and doing things that are not permissible. There is often a lot of mod discretion used in regard to this rule due to harm reduction awareness, recovery resources, and other helpful things as such.

**4) GEO-TAGGED POSTS ARE NOT ALLOWED and will be removed regardless of context.**

>See above location rule for explanation. People try to use the geo tag feature on the app to subvert this rule and it is ultimately a slap in the face to the mod team and the people who care about this place.

**5) MEET-UPS ARE NOT ALLOWED for ANY reason! Any posts discussing, offering, or requesting meet-ups will be removed. We are not responsible for anything that happens outside of this subreddit.** 

>This goes hand in hand with the sourcing rule mentioned above and is against reddit TOS as well, it has also brought unwanted *major* media attention to this subreddit that ultimately reached literally *millions* of readers outside of the internet, we do not need a repeat.

**6) We are not doctors! Take any advice you are given at your own risk. If you believe it may be serious it is always better to be safe, than sorry. Go to a real doctor!** 

>If you are having a major medical problem **get off reddit and go to a doctor!** We cannot assume liability for misdiagnosing you which could ultimately lead to your death.


**7) No advertisements of any kind. This means no peddling products, treatment centers, or substances.**

>Plain and simple, we will not tolerate any advertisements at all, as many have ulterior motives behind them, such as the rehab/insurance fraud ones and so fourth.

**8) Absolutely NO begging, asking for money, or assistance of ANY kind other than advice. Any sub that claims to be affiliated with us, and is not in our sidebar, is a scam. Your post will be removed and you WILL be banned.** 

>There are places on reddit that offer assistance that will help you, this is not the place for this behavior. 

**9) Mods reserve the right to remove content or restrict users' posting privileges as necessary if it is deemed detrimental to the subreddit or to the experience of others. Personal attacks or comments that insult or demean a specific user or group of users will be removed and regular or egregious violations will result in bans. This means no trolling, bullying, hate speech, or personal attacks. Any hateful speech that is directed at a person will be removed.** 

>This is the longest written rule for a reason, *clarity!* Tl;dr: remember the human on the other end of the conversation and be civil. It is okay to disagree and civilly discuss things, but do not let it devolve into name calling and hateful attacks. 



**10) Protect your personal information, and that of other subreddit members! Posts that contain personal or identifying information will be removed and a ban may be issued.** 

>People have taken a tiny amount of info in the past and used it to harm individuals very badly on here, watch every little thing you post. There has been attempted extortion, people getting fired, police called, probations violated, and so much more done from one slip up and one asshole.



**11) Any post or comment that creates, or perpetuates, drama will be removed AND A BAN WILL BE ISSUED.** 

>Keep it civil, let it go.

**12) Journalists and/or Media personnel: Please PM the mods if you'd like your credentials to be verified. Otherwise, please do not solicit interviews or information from our members.**

>This is to keep everyone safe from any person posing as someone they really aren't and obtaining information about you or using it in a way which you did not intend.

For smoking: Ms, E8, K9

Snorting: 54199 (God Tier Roxys, name brand Roxicodone all other brands are generics) 

A215\K9 as they seem to be near identical in size & taste. If I was blindfolded I could tell you the name of damn near every blue after crushing and railing but I’d never be able to tell the difference between A215/K9, the feel of the crush, taste of the drip, and amount of powder is nearly identical.

V’s I used to hate on these when I first started because they were harder to crush than others but I just got better at crushing em.. They seem to pack a punch and the drip taste great.

Spent 5 hours clutching my guts while hunched over a toilet puking and in pain so bad my vision was going blurry. Texted my wife to say I love her in case this is the day I finally die.

Then when the vomiting finally stopped I took a 20mg Oxycontin (I have no tolerance just prescribed to take as necessary). 1 hour later all my pain is completely dulled. It's there but it's kind of just a whisper in the background. I actually cried a little bit in relief. I can't believe how much the state of my reality has turned around.

I'm so thankful for the fact that this medication exists. It's the only thing that can take the pain away. I use it responsibility, as the doctor instructs, and I'm not physically addicted. It scares me to read stuff about how they want to make this harder to access. I don't know how I could survive if I didn't have a way to stop the pain.

I just don't understand how people in the old days survived without this stuff? What did you do if you got cancer? Stabbed or shot? Had a brain aneurysm?

I never ever use with random people. I am much older and should have known better. I was just on subs for a long time and forgot how the streets were therefore allowing me to get robbed and taken advantage of. 

We were both in detox and from out of state. She was 21 (F) and I am a very much older (F). When I got discharged she asked to come with me because her boyfriend she came down here with was extremely abusive. Something about her made me think of myself at that age. Innocent (HA!) and in an abusive relationship. So I said she could come hang with me. It was 4th of July and we rented a room until a sober house could become available after the holiday. (Great idea) it wasn’t too long before we were off to the races. I kept noticing my stuff being moved and I just thought she was stealing my cottons. Finally I flipped out and she swore she didn’t have anything she’s just airheaded. She said she had been to jail and they test you while you are in there. I knew nothing about this so I trusted her. Plus who would do such a thing?!! I never ever have shared a needle and I get tested religiously even after having sex with someone. After yelling at her for mixing up the needles a business card fell out of her purse for an infectious disease doctor. When I confronted her she locked herself in the bathroom and she was crying and screaming on the phone that she was scared and needed help. Meanwhile I was very calm and was just like why didn’t you tell me you have Hep C? Anyways I leave and call her “abusive ex” turns out not one thing she told me was true. She’s known she’s had Hep C for years and that he’s almost positive she’s positive for hiv as well. 

I feel so dumb. I am far too trusting. This was just supposed to be a fun, quick little relapse and now my life is changed and possibly ruined forever. 

EDIT: Anyone who has either or both please please please feel free to message me. I am freaking out. I am an alcoholic also so I have no clue how healthy I am. I have no idea what to expect. 

Imagine.... I spent all of my 20’s and half my 30’s shooting dope in a dark room alone. I decided to make a new friend and this happens. 

EDIT:  Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, reach out or even read. Writing this all out gave me extreme anxiety attacks. If I haven’t replied to you please know I’m not ignoring you. I just need time to process it and come back. Thanks for letting me get this out. They said it usually takes 6 weeks to show up on a test so I’ll be tested then. ",1531714131.0

You see, Heroin to them is like vitamin C to us and they hailed Enterprise with their emergency beacon when they got low on rations after hundreds of years of drifting through space and began having to shoot up rinses and used cottons.

Were they opiates or other drugs?,"Just curious because I've been browsing around and reading up on withdrawals from various drugs. I binged OC 80's over the past year but never more than 1-2 weeks, and I personally feel pretty horrible withdrawals (obviously relative as heavier users will face much worse withdrawals). My withdrawals from opioids mainly consist of pain in my stomach, loss of appetite, insomnia, night sweats, RLS and diarrhea. However, this is how I would rank my worst withdrawals:

1) Getting off a 2 year habit of daily Clonazepam (Klonopin)/Lorazepam (Ativan)/Xanax (Alprazolam) habit. Obviously I started off at 0.5mg, then 1mg, then 3mg, 6mg. By the end of it I was doing 8-10mg usually half Clonazepam as soon as I woke up and then the rest Xanax throughout the day. I quit cold turkey because tapering never worked for me.

BY FAR the worst type of withdrawals I've ever experienced. The rebound anxiety was like no other. I had one of the worst panic attacks I've ever experienced. Ended up in the hospital because my parents thought I was dying. Luckily no seizures and the worst was over about 2 weeks after I quit.

2) Gabapentin/Pregabalin (Neurontin/Pregabalin): I'm mentioning this not only because of how bad the withdrawals were, but because many people think that these two drugs are relatively harmless and non-addictive. Well, I was doing anywhere from 900mg-1200mg of Pregablin some days, and 4500mg-5000mg of Gabapentin other days. The Gabapentin I would space out in 30 minute intervals throughout the entire day. I know this is A LOT more than most people take, but they gave me euphoria unlike any other (not as good as opiates though). At first, I didn't realize my withdrawal symptoms were caused by these gaba drugs. I suffered for several weeks with EXTREME pain in my stomach. I often resorted to Hydrocodone/Oxycodone to numb the pain. This accompanied severe cramps in my stomache and not eating at all. Overall, this wasn't as bad as getting off the Benzo's but it was much worse than any opioid withdrawals I've had.

3) Oxy/Hydrocodone: Now these two, I would only binge 1-2 weeks at a time and then taking another 3 weeks off usually. However, I was taking pretty high doses compared to my tolerance since it would somewhat reset every 3 weeks but I'd continue with the same dose I left off. Some of you may have seen my posts regarding tapering these last couple of days. I get similar withdrawals to gabapentin in that I have severe pain in my stomach, but it doesn't match the pain caused by the gaba drugs. Also, this time I am tapering off rather than quitting cold turkey so it's been a much better experience.

So that's my experience. How about yours?",1531705910.0

Got a few Mexican Oxy with known fent press, good dude told me straight up. Didn't feel comfortable taking them and traded another random for some a214 15s, which is my rx dose, and I didn't think pressed 15s were a thing but none the less I never trust the street so I break it in half. 
I've never had or seen the 214 before but they had a consistent color, held their shape when split in half except they didn't taste bitter like oxy which was my first red flag. I was sick when I got them so I took half and had a massive headache most of the day about 4 hours later I started feeling sick again. I couldn't sleep either, usually oxy at night before beds puts me out. So now I'm sketched out. Tried sucking one again, no bitter. Spit it out and dropped it in some water, didn't dissolve quickly like I read presses do. Anyway I was so skittish I made 8 pills last me 3 days and now I have my refill and the mbox 15s have that oxy taste and no headache. My usual feelings.  What test kits do you all recommend?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006196/#!po=40.8333

They examined the behaviour of crushed OxyContin (OC) pills in terms of bioavailability and max concentration.

What shocks me is they found an intranasal B.A. of about 77%, which largely exceeds the one found in previous studies (47%).

*Intranasal bioavailability of crushed OxyContin tablets in this study (~77%) exceeds its oral bioavailability estimated at approximately 60%. [ … ] However, the present bioavailability results exceed a previous report of 47% IN bioavailability of oxycodone solution administered by nasal spray, perhaps the only other study to date to examine the bioavailability of IN oxycodone.* ***The lower bioavailability in that study may be attributable to solution volumes exceeding the 0.3- to 0.4-mL nasal mucosa limit for absorption.*** *Thus, excess solution likely entered the nasopharynx and esophagus, becoming subjected to GI absorption and metabolism.*

If I’m not mistaken, this would contradict the popular claim that oral Oxy is better than snorted, at least when it comes to bioavailability.

EDIT2-- This isnt’t an **observation**, this is an experiment that was done by selecting people who weren’t dependant on any substance at the time. They were placed in a facility for two weeks prior to the study and tested everyday. The adults in question were recreational users of oxy who weren’t addicted, therefore the sample size is small. Statistical ignificance is still there in the test.

EDIT-- Just to clarify, the oral BA still can go upwards to 85% depending on individual metabolism but averages at around 60%, and it should take longer to wear off (lower peak concentration too)ct",1531697628.0

Show I went to a spine specialist and was told I had kyphosis a  curvature of the spine, the percentage it was curves was too far along for a brace and they said the only option was surgery( was having trouble breathing as my lungs were being crushed in my rib cage by how curved my spine was) so I got my first agonizing painful surgery long story short I left with 180 Roxy's and about a hundred and fifty 10s and a long skinny bottle of morphine that had refills it was the only thing that made me feel better enough to get up and walk around and do my physical therapy but my pain never truly went away 

about a year-and-a-half later I was getting fevers very sick vomiting overall s***** feeling found out I had an infection in my blood and in my bone partially where Hardware was attached to my spine causing the bone to die and Hardware to move around which caused unbelievable amounts of pain so I had to go in to get that taken care of not as bad as the first surgery as only the top of my spine with operated on but there is nothing like going through such an operation.. my surgeon was a dick and accused me of being a drug seeker even though I was only 14 years old and didn't know what these drugs actually were because when he asked how I was feeling I told him the only thing that makes me feel okay where the blue pills... little did I know

 so years later battling pain i strted going to a pain management doctor that I was prescribed 320 mg oxycontin a day my dumbass got addicted to cocaine and was using large amounts daily and for the first time in 6 years my doctor drug tested me I failed and lost 30 pills a month that I needed so looking for some sort of relief a friend offered me some heroin and that was my crutch just helping me pass the day by. Little did I know 2 months later I would get drug tested again and the morphine and codeine in my piss resulted in me losing my script no weaning off just dropped me I started using heroin daily at that point 

I stopped using heroin when my best friend overdosed and took his last breath in front of me I swore I wouldn't use it again but after spending roughly $30,000 of my savings(all I had) I had no choice but to go back to heroin as 35 a bundle is better than 30 a pill I've been trying to find a doctor for 4 years to no avail I go stick with them for a couple of months and they won't budge off of 10mg I use other people's urine just to get the clean pass or have low levels of Oxycodone in them- this year I was told that my pain is due to my bones never healing properly and the pain is worse than ever I'm losing feeling in my legs and tingling all over and they want to give me another operation which I flat-out refuse I can't go through such pain again all those little feelings that I remember are coming back to haunt me causing me not to sleep and getting so nauseous and turned off by the world I can't eat.  

I am currently on heroin and my small online business that is kept me a float for years is not bringing enough of income to pay for my habit and have money for anything else so I pretty much spend everything I have on dope and at the end of the day the pain is always there I just feel like my life can't go on much longer like this even though the same feelings years ago have brought me to where I am now I just wish a doctor would see me but there's no way I'm going to get 9 Roxy's a day plus breakthrough medication from any doctor here in the big city I've been to doctors all over and no one is willing to help me I even flat out told one doctor that I had to go to heroin after I lost my script and I know it's a liability but I am just trying to get my life back together back on my pills 

I don't know what to do anymore I'm in constant pain and severely depressed and have no money to do anything I have no room to grow in my industry with no seed money and I am trying to save but every time I have a little bit of savings it ends up going to dope because I can't work if I'm in pain and or sick I really don't know what to do I've tried so many doctors so many months wasted just trying to get me back to where I was with all of these indictments and things I see why they are scared to prescribe opioids but there are people in pain in need

I am scared to get this operation for many reasons one of the biggest being how could I deal with such pain on such low doses of opioids I'm scared waking up out of surgery and only having 30 mg to make me feel better is impossible and I would have to be doing dope in the hospital in recovery and they're on just making the cycle never ending I don't want to quit as opioids are the only thing since I was 12 years old that got me out of bed I'm scared to lose my life to this street cut bullshit and I just feel like at 23 years old my life is at a standstill my surgeon told me there are a couple of more operations I will have to endure to become completely better Spine and Neck and pelvis which is no question not going to happen I guess I rather just deal with the pain and scrounge together money to pay for this fuck in bullshit.. 

I have friends that are addicts and I wish that's all I was just an addict but in this scenario I am both an addict and a pain patient I was always functioning very well on my medicine making good money for my age and I have a good head on my shoulders I know I'm not like most people and I can get places in the world this s*** is just ruining me and I don't know why I can't find a doctor to help me in any way shape or form someone recommended me going to a doctor that is about a 30-hour drive which I laughed at because going across the country for a script just seems unreasonable to somebody who isn't faking an injury but maybe that's the only option I have it's not even like I have the money to go somewhere and sit around waiting to know if they will serve me or not..  

I don't do anything all day I sleep in depression eat and go back to laying down I am in pain that I can't describe in words and I am sick of feeling this way I know an operation isn't going to help cuz it was supposed to help the first and second time I just don't know what to think is my life over at this point sometimes I feel like I should just kill myself but my mom and grandma are the only things keeping me here I don't know how they would live without me as we are all we have

Only thing is, he told me it was only 2-3 times whilst he was a little tipsy and upset, but I know for a fact he has since used regularly and has refused to tell me and has straight up lied to me. He knows my trust for him is broken and that I am trying to rebuild it, and whilst him using again is a huge deal, I'd rather know than him hide it and me find out on my own weeks later when he's been using every other day or so to cope with everything.

It breaks my heart knowing he feels he can't tell me because he's afraid I'll leave him, but this feels so much worse than finding out from him as it happens.

The old man had bad luck.,"Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk, an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

“F\*cking imbeciles! I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse sh\*t!” Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

“I know. I know,” Travis replied. “I talked to Zeke about it. He said he didn’t know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don’t believe it, though.”

Some drama I wasn’t privy to, but I found out later that Tom’s dog was missing. It was one of two times Zeke and his girlfriend, Justine, had stolen and traded the old man’s pure-bred Pekinese for a bag of cocaine to Freddy, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double-wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his bald head to the stained waistband of his shorts. His shirt was always off. His health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

(Once after Freddy moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple of ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas with the silver dollars into a milk jug. His neighbors saw us do it, but New Mexico is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man’s dog got eaten by coyotes in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.)

“Tom, this is Riley. Riley, this is Tom.”

“The indomitable Turtle, they can’t keep me down! Turtle Tom Stone! Pleased to meet you!” His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock, where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band. He stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn’t stand Turtle, though. He thought Tom was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Tom coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in a can of soup, probably from the wreck in the ravine. Travis looked at me horrified. Tom acted like he didn’t hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to out west, he had stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow, he lost his U-haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Tom did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of fifth gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory summoned my imagination. They said it was still the wild, wild West out here, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped and rose back up toward Colorado.",1531669797.0

To answer some of the questions in that thread, I've always done binges of 1-2 weeks at a time, followed by decent to severe withdrawals depending on how severe my binge was. I always used OC 80s throughout this binge, chewed up and potentiated with grapefruit juice and tums. This latest binge was the longest/hardest and went something like this: 80mg, 80mg, 100mg, 80mg, 160mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 80mg, 160mg (5 days ago). Followed by: 40mg, 40mg, 20mg (I didn't end up redosing that night), 10mg (yesterday, held down the withdrawal symtpoms). Today I decided to break the 80 into 5mg pieces. First I split 80 into 40, 40 into 20, here's where it got tricky. I broke the 20 into 4 pieces but they weren't really that even and really small pieces. I don't know if the 5mg will take care of withdrawals but I'm carrying another 5mg piece in case it doesn't take care of them. 

My withdrawals include night sweats, insomnia but worse of all: Pain in my stomach, loss of apetite followed by even greater pain in my stomach.

I know the suggestions offered a slower taper schedule than what I'm doing but it seems each successive day, half the previous dose takes care of the withdrawal symptoms. Since I dropped to 20mg and then 10mg, the withdrawals do return by night time but they aren't as severe and I manage to fight through the night. I will update in a bit to see if the 5mg took care of withdrawals or not. 

If it does take care of the withdrawals, you think a couple more days on 5mg and I can stop at that point? If the 5mg doesn't take care of withdrawals, how many days should I stay at 10mg before attempting to go back down to 5mg?

Instead I immediately proceeded to order a bunch of shit for my bike and turtles. Not a single regret or ounce of buyer's remorse as a result. 


&nbsp;


Finally spoke to my buddy Tim. He is still commited to staying clean as he was last week, I'm really glad that he meant it when he said he was planning to do this. He goes to N.A. meetings and gets his subs from a special program at the hospital where they don't give you a full month's supply which is really good for him. Tim has trouble taking his prescribed dose, by getting a specific amount administered to him, it prevents him from running out of subs early which has become a main reason for him to buy dope. 


He said some really positive shit when I texted him that makes me feel really good about him being okay. 


&nbsp;

I've considered going to N.A. meetings and as I taper down my subs maybe I should before seeking alternatives, such as buying dope. I was thinking about lying to Cliff and telling him that I'm going to N.A., but then I realized maybe I should actually go. Cliff still texts me every other day despite my being cold. He has asked why I never hang out anymore. This being a question that I answered succinctly.


Bottom line, I'm not doing dope and can't be near the temptation. If that's not enough of an explanation for Cliff, then I guess he can keep texting me until he gets the hint. 


&nbsp;


Some of his texts during the week said he ""didn't need anything"" from me but then on two of those days he texted me early-ish. Asked me to text him when I'm up or when I'm  having my ""morning java"". I didn't answer or pretended to be at work (unless I was at work). On one of those mornings he said ""I need to use your internet until I get paid tomorrow"", so there it was. He did need something from me after all. It won't cost me more to share my internet, unless we count the bed bugs.


&nbsp;

So what if I simply said to Cliff, ""my N.A. counselor says I shouldn't tempt myself, I'd like to hang out with you after I get some clean time."" Then I can guilt trip him if he tries to convince me otherwise and accuse him of getting in the way of my recovery. But alas, it's just easier and more courteous to keep it simple and maybe even honest.

Plus, I'd hate for Cliff to have nothing better to do than to spread the word that ""Sloan is attending N.A. meetings.""

I don't want his immediate family to know anymore than they do, especially his younger brother who has suspected that I'm an addict. Then we have Derrick the middle. I could totally see Cliff bringing me attending N.A. up to Derrick and Derrick deciding to run with it. He might forget or not care that I am trying keep a secret. His secret is out, and sense of honor cares not of keeping from exposing my secret.

Derrick's younger brother is successful, clean and judgemental. He may be a sex addict (literally) but he's above the addict's lifestyle when it comes to chemical dependence.

&nbsp;

Derrick's younger brother is so judgmental and would rat me out if he was a 100% sure I was an addict, might've ratted me out once already but without adequate proof the attempted intervention caught nothing. So there's no point in me telling Cliff I'm going to N.A., more bad can come of it.. but if I was to tell that to Cliff, I think I'd at least like to really be going to N.A.

&nbsp;


If I were to go to NA, I wouldn't want to talk about how I get my subs on the street, but don't they say honesty is really important? Can I show up and omit part of the truth? Then I think, how anonymous is N.A.? As a retail worker in a medium sized community there is a chance that... well, is that an issue? 


&nbsp;


I'm working on a story right now. It involves, a Mars colonist, his ex-wife acting strangely after doing business with a certain Clifford because her doctor stopped prescribing her pain meds. In this story it will be established and explained how Cliff became a giant mass of bed bugs. Like a shape shifter comprised from a colony of bugs that form the shape of a human body. 

Just not sure how they ""think"" but I'm thinking they (the bed bugs) gotta copy his memories somehow if the mass of bugs are to occasionally speak to people while convincing them that they are the original Cliff. I believe a doctor will discover that the bed bugs use a hive mind and chemical signals to replicate the operation of Cliff's brain. 

I'm thinking host body and parasites like Go'uld from Stargate but combined with Changeling characteristics and with the gawdyness of a 'Men in Black' alien posing as a human hidden beneath a clever facade.


&nbsp;

The alien mass of bugs that jacked Cliff's body don't have a car, a ship of their own or a means to top off the ship's deuterium reserves. This is not to say that deuterium is not super common. Heck, the aliens of this autonomous hive mind have the means to turn hydrogen into deuterium but they're too lazy to transport the water and they can't travel too close to the Sun either.

As it would turn out, the alien Bed Bugs sought out a mind that was compatible with their own. This particular sub-hive had borrowed the spacecraft from their collective because they claimed it was a need and an ""emergency"". The collective provided a worn down ship because this particular sub-hive had the tendency to borrow things and not return them in their original condition. 

&nbsp;

As it stood, they owed 30,000 space-bed-bug credits as a result of past unpaid loans. The one thing about running debts with a collective of bed bugs is that it's like a blockchain. As long as more than 50% of the collective retains the memories of a debt it'll remain ""on file"" in a sense. Copies are transmitted via unfalsifiable chemical signals.

The result, the collective didn't refuse to help, they didn't even bother transmitting their response. 

&nbsp;

Without a response from the collective, the mass of bed bugs that comprises what appears to be Cliff's body had to make preparations to get off this rock themselves. Since there's too many bed bugs to fit in a single body, they can't form up to replace an astronaut to get into space and even if they did - the mission would get scrubbed if a single bed bug was caught running around the ship. Unless the Russians don't care about that kind of thing since we are hitching rides on their launch vehicles.

&nbsp;

Speaking of ship, our ship technology would not get them into the higher orbit that would be needed. The alien ship, more like a shuttle.. is in a higher orbit just waiting to be refueled. If the bugs are able to deliver deuterium to the alien bed bug ship, they can report back to their planet with their findings. A whole planet full of potential human host bodies would at least cause their governing authority to expunge the sub-hive's many debts. 

Since this sub-hive plans on earning so much money from discovering the humans on Earth, they decided to take after the mind of their host's body and buy some heroin. The sub-hive of bed bugs can share the dopamine signals by using their own chemical signals and antennae to emulate synaptic connections.


&nbsp;

So that's the rough version of how a mass of Bed Bugs replaced most of Cliff''s body and why he is an alien who might someday warrant a visit from the MIB.",1531663264.0

Withdrawals get worse and worse and worse, fuck this shit, i need to figure something out. So i search for roofing tar on CL and start texting people in my area ""in need of roofing materials.""

Now i have no criminal record and have a lot of responsibilities in my life, so i cant afford to get busted or get my ass whooped.

One dude replies. Asks me if im mobile. I reply and say that i am and that i would like to try before buying. He says okay and tells me to meet at a close by shopping center, like a 5 minute drive. 

Theres a starbucks in the shopping center, i say lets meet inside there, hand me a piece, ill smoke it in the bathroom, and if its legit, ill give you the cash and we can execute the transaction. He says ok.

So the positive signs are that 1) public place, 2) i get to try it first, 3) guy is italian. My gut tells me it looks good.

I go to the starbucks and im standing outside. The dude is running a little late, bad sign. I call him, he says hes parked far and that hes walking to me. I thought that was kind of odd. I describe what im wearing. So im standing there and crossing my fingers. 

Dude walks up, gives me the ""are you him?"" look/body language. I nod. Right off the bat, he looks really non threatening.

I've experience with every other opiate under the sun besides RC's, even heroin, but these patches have a **72 HOUR** time release, and a total of 5.50mg of fentanyl each.  Everything I read about using these recreationally gave the same advice -- DON'T 

However, I decided to tread lightly and smoke/vape some.  I started with a tiny sliver off the corner, which I felt nothing from.  Then after 20 mins or so, I cut a small square, smaller than a standard tab of acid, and vaporized that.  I felt a slight body high come on over the next 10 mins or so, but no rush as I would expect from smoking something stronger than heroin, so next I cut a slice off long-ways, about the same width as the square I cut, and rolled this into a spliff, so that the center of the joint contained the long slice of fentanyl patch, evenly distributed across the length of the spliff.  I figured this way, when I felt it hitting me, I could put it out, never getting more at once than I had initially tested.  (Important I also had a sitter present)  Half way through the joint I did catch a strong buzz, and I chose not to finish it, though I could have smoked the rest and been fine, as I found out in my later experiments.  

It works quite well!  Probably not great for the lungs, but it takes such a small amount, it's not so bad.  The flavor is masked by the weed/tobacco unless it's vaporized straight.  Nice novelty opiate smoking experience.  I give it a 7/10, would/will probably do again until I run out of patches lol",1531649753.0
8z0qtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8z0qtf/am_i_just_a_poorfast_metabolizer_or_do_i_just/,16,https://redd.it/8z0qtf,HYDROMORPHONE_ZONE,Am I just a poor/fast metabolizer or do I just have a weird body? I need insane amounts of opiates/opioids to get high. Enough that would OD the opiate naieve.,"My body has a permanent naturally high baseline tolerance to opiates/opioids. I could go months to years without taking opiates and still need like 60 mgs of hydrocodone to get high. Never have gotten high from codeine. I need like 50 or so mgs of oxycodone and at least 4 mgs of Dilaudid IV to get a decent rush. I need at least 8 mgs of Dilaudid IV to pin my pupils and get a badass/good rush. Because of this I've always feared not getting enough pain meds prescribed if I needed them for pain. Especially in today's circumstances where they're scared to prescribe Tylenol 3s. You've gotta be lucky to get Vicodin or better. In most situations you're going home with 15-30 tramadol tablets or 10-20 Tylenol 3s. My aunt is in chronic pain management for Crohn's disease and she gets like 90 Vicodin 10/325s a month and has been for like 8 months. She keeps asking for more or something stronger but her doctor just says that he's not going to throw pills at her and also says to just trudge through the pain.

tl;dr I need these dosages to get high with a baseline tolerance

Codeine (Tylenol 3/4)  - Doesn't get me high

Hydrocodone (Vicodin) - 60 mgs+ IR (oral)

Oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin) - 50 mgs+ IR (oral)

Hydromorphone (Dilaudid) - 4-8mgs+ (IV) (preferably 8mgs, 4 will give me a rush but I need 8 to pin my pupils)",1531649396.0

After you do 3 meet ups you get a custi number and then  we can do face to face. He said tell me where you want me to leave it like a mailbox and take a picture. I knew right then scam and I laughed to him""hahaha and what I just leave the doe in the mailbox and hope you don't leave pencil shavings in there good one"" but then he took it up a notch no you just pay with Amazon GC. I was lile""listen my dude, we're both on discreet numbers, your not losing a potential sale cause I know this scam you'll ask for pics of them next, could you just be straight with me? Does this work a lot?"" Pause ""1000 a week man it's crazy"". He told me a bunch of shit and I told him no big deal I could go to Kenzo and cop whenever but I wanted delivery. Dude then said the funniest thing.  He said ""dude try the darknet there's only scammers on here"" loled so hard. I talked to him for a while. Even offered me 50 a day to post these ads on CL across the US. Just figured I'd give some insight into this whole thing.
