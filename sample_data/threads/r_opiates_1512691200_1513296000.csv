I've found this long list of drugs that interact with these enzymes and thought it might be a useful resource here (also at bluelight and erowid but i dont feel like making an account, feel free to copy and paste this there if someone wants) so I'm making a but of a PSA for potentiator awareness and information. For those that dont know, potentiators are drugs that interact with other drugs to make the effects better in a variety of ways. Think of your brain as a burning house, opiates as firemen, and potentiators as their axe. Sure, theyll get to that fire and do what theyre trying to do, but if they have an axe itll be really easy and theyll have time to try out that new xbox for the station that was ""lost in the fire."" CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are enzymes that have to do with how opiates and many other drugs are broken down in the body; inhibitors make them less effective, inducers make them more effective. Ill try to give a quick breakdown of what i know here, but dont take my word for it and do your own research.


https://liferaftgroup.org/long-list-of-inhibitors-and-inducers-of-cyp3a4-and-cyp2d6/


Inducing these enzymes will increase the elimination rate of most relevant drugs and each enzyme has their own set of metabolizations with certain drugs. For example, CYP2D6 metabolizes tramadol into O-desmethyltramadol, a much for potent opiod so youd want to use an inducer with tramadol. CYP3A4 metabolizes morphine into inactive products so you'd want to inhibit it if taking morphine. There are many many things these enzymes can do and it varies drug to drug, so make sure you do your own research. Generally, inhibiting these will make opiates last longer and CYP2D6 is more often considered when potentiating. There is certainly much much more to know about this topic so heres a thread with lots of discussion and explanation.


http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-370193.html


As a little aside, I very much enjoy learning about and applying knowledge of drugs. It'd be really cool if people more knowledgeable than me could point me to a specific place, method, or direction that can help me learn more.



Potentiators CAN be dangerous in the sense that if done right, you're essentially taking more of the drug than normal with a given dose, so watch out folks. If I got anything wrong here please correct me. I certainly do not do drugs I just really fucking love drugs because of the science. And stuff.",1512744591.0

I also took a really low dose (0.05mg) of flunitrazolam (benzo RC) when I woke up, but that's like 8 hours ago. It's duration is only 5 hours but it's half life could be longer? I can't really find reliable info on that, should I wait longer? 12 hours before taking that dose I took more of flunitrazolam, but that should be long gone out of my system too right?

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

Stopped by a shop for some cash, I tho thw asshole low balled me so I went to another shop with a smarter owner/manager, arrived at about 1:45 after stopping to toss the $5 minimum needed in my gas tank, the cars great on gas 26mpg to 45mpg usually closer to mid 30's where I live. After getting 35$ more than original guy I hit up my guy for a meet. 


  I texted first then called 3 minutes later and was hoping to be quick as I was in the area, hence the impatience. He calls me back right as I hang up after hearing his VM. He asks where I'm at I tell him then ask if he's got both and he says yea, yea (awesome only one stop and waiting to meet on one dude before I can retreat home to get my groove on) and well dude told me to meet him 3 different places before deciding McDonalds, great its 3 minutes behind me. Pull up texting him let him know I'm there and light up a smoke and what do you know he shows up right when I get halfway done which when I first started going through him was common, but now it was a nice chance of pace.


  I didn't take any pictures, but he hooked it up for just a little over $100 I got; 16 bags of boy and I'd say close to a gram of soft girl (yes I know its cut but for the price I'm good w/ that). Got home by 2:55 and pushed off shortly after. Been partying pretty good solo for 9 hours. Now I am drinking some rum and coke to chase down my 2mg of klonopin That I crushed and parachuted to try and enhance it a bit. I know alcohol, and klonopin, and dope is generally a recipe for respiratory depression, but I have confidence in my use and the such. Plus I would like to sleep tonight and save my last bit of coke n' dope for a nice morning shot. Being as I have 1 more shot of dope and like 1-2 of coke debating on coke still.



  Well that's my story's pretty much the state of my life, I do this once or twice or thrice a month the other days I set due and get by with suboxone. Any questions or hate or comments or love always appreciated. I do not love this cycle, but I love the time when I'm at today.

A few minutes later, they were there to arrest us. Dick cop told me they were charging me/us with possession. I was confused though, because the dope was all gone. All that was left were empty bags & a rig. So they took me in and left him in the hospital for a few hours, then came and got him too. As I layed there on my cement bed, in my fucking freezing cold cell, I finally asked them wtf was going on. Like what am I even being charged with? He said that Im being held on probable cause for 48 hrs and if the DTs can't put a case together, I'm free to go. So the DTs came in & started asking me where I got the dope from and all that good stuff, so honestly I told them.

We didn't get a court date. Are the DTs gonna come find him and make him cooperate with them to get the dman? Im confused because don't they use people with charges to help them, and then offer those people immunity from their charges? Can they arrest him for not helping out? And aren't there Good Samaritan Laws that protect us? i just read that there were. Also, the DTs said that there was a rig and some residue left in the bags so thats how they got us for posession. But I dont think we got charged because they released us. Is he obligated to work as an informant? Will they come get him if he doesn't? Is there a law protecting us? Can someone help please.

I got into heroin about this time last year. Quickly became less and less interested in other drugs, even other things. Dope and depression became the ONLY things in my life and I'm making a serious effort to improve myself. I've been dependent on various substances from age 15 onward, currently 19 and trying to dig myself out this hole while im still young and have time to make something of myself. I'm finding the hardest part of getting clean isn't staying clean itself, however trying to find other things to fill the shoes left by heroin. I almost never leave the house unless im going straight to my job or home, and am missing the whole lifestyle surrounded by my addiction. It was fast paced, unpredictable. Also certainly dangerous and stupid, but theres nothing quite like it.

I realize none of this is groundbreaking and things like this get posted all the time. I just felt like making a short post that I can go back to in the future and see how I was feeling at this pivotal moment in my future.  Hope someone read it, thanks!

I don‚Äôt see anybody talking about it on this sub,"Agmatine really helps. If you‚Äôre already shooting up several bags of H a day don‚Äôt worry about it. If you can afford it at that level at least, but you can take agmatine. I‚Äôll explain why. 

If you are taking milder Opiates, agmatine will help a lot with potentiation. Your opiate will feel quite a measurable bit stronger if you take agmatine before it. I weigh about 240 and take 2,000 mg agmatine with my opiate medicine, so adjust your agmatine dosage based on that. I could probably take 2,500 of ag, but 2,000 seems to work the best. As well as potentiating the opiate at dose, it also lowers your tolerance slowly. So taking agmatine daily will lower the opiate you need, to feel high or keep you from getting sick at least. This is where you heavy IV users will get some benefit. After a couple weeks you can go from 6 bags a day to 4 or less. It doesn‚Äôt affect the feeling of any opiate other than a mild boost to the sedation and euphoria, so it‚Äôs only a bonus.

Tl;dr taking agmatine will make your opiate stronger and lower your tolerance over time. ",1512700643.0

Since getting clean our lives have gotten exponentially better. New apartment, new jobs, doing well. But she is struggling with depression and has been dead set on picking up this weekend. I thought it would pass as the week went on, but it hasn't. 

I'm not going to lie, I wanna use too. Badly. You know how it is. But I'm kinda happy. I love my job, I'm good at it, and I don't feel so empty anymore all the time. Maybe I can stay clean. But she is intent on going this weekend. Like 110%. 

If she goes and brings it home, I'm going to end up using. I'm very worried that if I ask her to do it on her own away from me she will OD. She has never shot herself up before, and she's always telling me not to ""baby"" her in regards to her dosage when I used to shoot her up. 

How can I approach this? I've said I'm unsure about it. I've told her if her connect isn't around let's just forget it then.. and instead she tells me ""oh fuck no this is happening.""

What do I do? I'm already so anxious and looking forward to using, but I'm not sure I even want to? My stomach is doing backflips in anticipation of something I don't really even wanna do.

7i8lg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7i8lg9/quitting/,21,https://redd.it/7i8lg9,honeybunchesofOPES,Quitting,"I see all of these posts with encouragement for people that are struggling - whichever part of the process they are at and I just wanted to chime in to say:

Thank you. I‚Äôm going to have to make myself quit (again) tomorrow because I‚Äôm finally at the point where my family‚Äôs quality of life might suffer. I previously worked in a position that made me regularly in excess of $250k a year but I was traveling 60% of the year and started using Rx to cope with the depression of missing lots of family events (I missed my sons first birthday & Christmas). 

I quit that job and reinvented myself in a different career and have been able to garner decent money but not enough to support a habit, pay a mortgage, pay for private school, etc. to maintain the facade of normalcy. I have been working in this career field for the last 2.5 years and able to tuck my son into bed every night. I however wasn‚Äôt able to reinvent myself in the sense that I still take pills. I am spending money that I shouldn‚Äôt to cope with another unhappy and stressful situation at work. 
The content of my current job and the schedule are extremely satisfying. I however have been working with a man that has hit on me (in varying degrees of intensity) over the past year and a half - most could be easily and jokingly (phrases such as ‚Äúoh haha thank you that‚Äôs flattering but I think I would disappoint you) dismissed but this summer I was actually propositioned for sex while my wife was away. I had to actually be very stern that I‚Äôm straight and was not interested in having sex. Since June this person has withheld business and effectively reduced my income by $50,000. I‚Äôve been seeking out a new position (both in current industry & prior) since July when I saw the writing on the wall after the sexual harassment. 

I‚Äôm at another crossroads now. Yesterday I was offered a position in my previous industry as an employee ( I was a consultant when I raked in the $250k) for $120k + vehicle + several other intangibles since it‚Äôs one of the largest MNC in the world. I will certainly have to take a drug test - more than likely urine but I worry about hair since they are able to quantify (somewhat) how much you‚Äôve taken plus I have taken some RX opiates not prescribed to me which would pose an issue. This position has extensive travel (50-60% of the year) but within 1-2 years (it has been explicitly stated) that I would be groomed for an office position. Being away from my family until that happens will be just as difficult as before though because well, I love them. 


Yesterday I was also offered a position at a VERY nice brokerage in an ideal setting that has a tremendous track record. Their lowest producers make $120k and their best make $400k+. I think I could start out very well with my track record over the past two years. I‚Äôm somewhat afraid of that position because it is completely commission based. I‚Äôve spent a lot of money I shouldn‚Äôt and I will need to float myself until I start to close deals.  There is no drug test for the second position. 

I turned in my notice last Wednesday and my employer asked me to close out all projects and then go, which should be next Wednesday. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do but I do know that I need to quit taking pills. I don‚Äôt want to go into details but it‚Äôs no small amount. I have been to rehab once before and got 3 months clean only to fall back into it. I‚Äôve quit and been through withdrawal probably 100+ times over the last 10 years outside of rehab. 

So many scenarios, possibilities, endings and of course I need to quit to ensure that I am able to pass a urine test and there is no necessity for hair. I acquired 8 - 8 mg Suboxone but it‚Äôs so hard to even get to the 24 hour mark unfortunately. I will start these tomorrow I guess. I wonder if anyone here can help me determine initial dosage?

I completely get that all of these problems are first world issues and pale in comparison to what some people go through - but they are real and they are my problems. I am going to have to try and make a good decision for my family and detox at the same time. I‚Äôm tired, confused, excited, scared, and a multitude of other emotions to try and steer my ship correctly. 

Sorry for the long whining post but it‚Äôs tough to share in meetings for some reason. Thank you for listening. Input welcomed. ",1512671876.0

Would you go back?," So after a few days break i went and copped today. I get to the block and right away see a dude that i copped from before but he says he doesn't know me so i park me truck in the parking lot at the end of the block where they always are. Three is two younger dboys one starts grilling me he finally says ok but immediately walks away. I'm used to this hassle, i don't look like your typical junkie, I drive a clean older truck and already come alone. I don't take it personal if i was them I'd wonder about me to, but i have been coming here for a month. I bail out, which you more than often have to do.  I walk back to the first guy i talk to, two more come out he asks if they know me they both say no.  After a little hesitation 1 walks up, easy and smooth transaction. I walk back and say to other one, common man you don't recognize me? You served me a few times. He says hell no, i don't recognize no one. I just say ok and get back in my truck. As soon as i do three squads come flying in. The first one stops in front of the house they are always coming out of. The second goes to go around him, it looked like he was gonna pull into the lot where i was parked. If he wanted me there was nothing i could do about it, i had no where to go. So i popped my bags in my mouth and watched but he through his car in park and got out. It looked like they all got away and i was able to slide out the back of the parking lot being only two blocks from the eway and being in the clear. It's on a vey busy street that is under construction so it took a long time to make it those two blocks. The dboy who said he doesn't recognize anyone was walking in the same direction and staring at me the whole way. 

So getting to my question do you think it would be a bad move to go back? Im not talking about because it's hot, but because they might think i set this up. This spot has a ton of traffic, is been hot this isn't the first or the last time the cops have hit it.  AGAIN I'm not asking if you think i should risk getting stopped by the cops there, but if you would risk getting out for a hand to hand. They were asking if i was a cop not a snitch so i think the worst that would happen is no one would serve me. But idk we all know its part of the game. I think it will be good to try again in a couple days. What do you think? ",1512671273.0

Here comes a wall o text.

Dear Ceya,

You have no idea how much I've missed you and thought about you. I didn't leave a note while visiting you in the hospital while they had you in that medically induced coma because I thought you wouldn't want anyone to see you like that. All of us were terrified. Girl, do you know how many of our atheist or god hating friends (like myself) actually prayed? When Ellie told me through sniffles and about a million tissues about your foot turning inward in the bed it broke me down bad because I knew the last thing you bought was those super sexy bright pink platform heels with the buckles that now you wouldn't even be able to wear for at least a while. That was just profoundly sad. My tears spelled out your name more than a few times.

I'm kind of glad your family is keeping the healthier you away from us. It's lonely, to be sure, but it's better this way. Many of your friends and I are afraid of inflicting ourselves on you and your recovery. Those nonbelievers are still praying, not because the believe in God but because they believe in asking for good things to come to you. 

Ellie told me you thought you ruined my life by being a bad example when I was knee high to a doc marten. Hell no, I've been destroying myself long before you sold to me, nor were you the first I bought from or used with. I don't put that on the first folks either because that was all me. Going through you was vastly safer than other scary folks. Not to mention I surely would have turned cyan and died without Big Sister's supervision. You were better to me than I deserved.  The people who loved you were helped by your hand so many times whether it was cleans, fronts, supervision, or a couch to sleep on. We crave good news of our truest friend.

Ceya, I miss you and whether you're clean or not, you're absolutely the best. If you are I hope it's permanent and hope to join you one day. If not, I understand. I just wanted to let you know I can never love you less.",1512832834.0

But what about all the good Dboys and middles out there? I felt like making this appreciation thread after copping with my middles today. Also I gotta give some credit to my first ever dboy.So about 2 years ago now (Maybe just a bit over 1 year? W/E doesn't matter) I met my first Dboy. He live about 5 minutes away from me, had a business degree, and was all around good at managing money. Very, very professional, and he was white too. He charged a fair price and his stuff wasn't half bad. What made him particularly awesome though was we could totally just chill and shoot the shit. Our conversations weren't just limited to 2 words, and we shared a lot of interests in music and video games. and the best part about this dude? I never had to wait! He was always ready as soon as I came on by. We were about as close to friends as one can be with their D-boy. Given the nature of ""The game"" as y√°ll like to call it we could never actually be friends exactly. But we got along well, and he treated me good. He'd hook me up fat too fairly regularly.

So rafter he got arrested on completely unrelated bullshit charges I found my current middle. He's also a pretty cool dude too! I got a long ass drive to get to him, which is annoying but the nice thing is that it helps me not go and cop junk all the time so I don't get addicted. He also doesn't short me. Whenever we meet up with the dboy he's right next to me and he always takes his half, which is a totally reasonable amount. Also he's got a good sense of humor so we also joke around a bit and shoot the shit.


So yeah, the 2 people that I had to go through to get H have been pretty good too me and I don't have any complaints. And honestly I can say is kinda enjoy/ed the time I've spent dealing with them.

If I ever spiraled into an active addiction I know it would destroy the friends/job situation but i think I'd be fine with it, cuz I see no reason in staying alive anyways, probably the only thing keeping me around is knowing that maybe I'll find some opiates to enjoy. Especially when I'm old and retired. Told my psychiatrist I'm planning on shooting heroin for my 75th birthday and she seemed 100% on board with it. At least that's a goal I guess üòÇüòÇ",1512803118.0

Wtf,"(tldr at bottom, and sorry for posting twice, first ones title was incomprehensible thanks to a nod) Hey guys, so tonight when I was going to do a shot on my left mainline (I had missed this vein earlier in the day and there was a large and hard bump further up), and the blood Drew up bright red. Now, I know this is where the vein was. Ive been alternating between this and my other mainline for almost my entire use, and it was exactly where my vein was supposed to be, so I pushed down a lil just to check, and fuck did it hurt. Definitely an artery. Just switched to my other arm and moved on with no problems. Anyway, I decided to do another shot just now back in my left arm to see if my vein was back in place, (I'm using a 1/2 inch needle, I always hit my vein right when the needle is fully inserted at a 30 something degree angle), but suddenly, as the needle was about half in, it hurt like /hell/. It burned badly. I kept going for whatever reason, and right before the needle was fully inserted, it stopped. I registered, and you guessed it, bright red blood. I removed the needle and bled like a stuck pig of course, but now I'm curious: tf happened to my vein? I've never had an artery so shallow before, and I'm positive it was not there before. I had never hit an artery in the crook of either elbow in my 2 year history of IV use. Anyone got an idea? 

TL;DR: there's an artery right where my vein was in the crook of my left elbow. I'm absolutely positive it wasn't there before, and it's /exactly/ where my vein was. Tf happened and why? I missed a shot near here recently if that means anything.",1512801539.0

*My name is Jesse*

*I have a history of polysubstance abuse - mainly EtOH.  I have destroyed the last decade of my life.*

*Today I have 100 days sober*

*I have been using kratom daily for precisely 98 days*


**Kratom has helped me with three issues**

*1) completely abolishes alcohol cravings/ mental obsession*

*2) abolished constant suicidal ideation*

*3) reduces feelings of dissociation*

*4) overeating /binging / purging (BED & bulimia)*


**I consider kratom safe for these reasons**

*1) no urge to compulsively redose*

*2) don't feel ""loaded"" or ""intoxicated""*

*3) greatly reduced nicotine use*

*4) tolerance does not develop with moderate use*

**This is why I'm actively looking for an alternative**

*1) limited duration of action (</=6 hr) - therefore a second dosage is required towards the end of the day*

*2) 15-20$/day cost /not financially sustainable*

*~
I am afforded the ability to utilize health insurance as of the first of 2018* - *in lieu of this, on the hunt for a more viable and long-term option* *(I have used buprenorphine in the past with positive results surpassing kratom)*

**The main issues and /or hindrances to this**

     *I currently live in halfway therefore, typical opioids are obviously tested for*



*¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨¬¨*
**What I am looking for today are suggestions and ideas from the /r/opiates community**

~
**Here are my remaining tangential thoughts**


*¬∞Research Chemicals are not out of the realm of possibility - yes, I have tried tianeptine (and abused it instantly... IV and oral... 100g in 35days)*

*¬∞Is there anything that triggers the release of endogenous opioids?  (obviously other than EtOH) *

*¬∞ALSO anything that DOESN'T recruit b arrestin*


~
*Thanks for your time and suggestions
Also, P. S. if this is better suited in a different subreddit OR in multiple ones please let me know*

*Warm regards, 
Jesse*

So due to tinychat's instability and continued problems with bugs and the fact that they keep fucking up the youtube player which is the most important thing, one of our community members recommended a move to ezcapechat.com and so far everyone likes it a lot. it's far more stable, handles data faster, appears to lack the echo problems that tc had, has a functional youtube player that anyone (not just mods) can add tracks to and it forms an automatic playlist, and you can personalize the chat text and color, as well as move the cameras around more freely. the room is at [WherEiSopiatechat](https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat). If you can't click links for whatever reason the address is https://www.ezcapechat.com/rooms/whereisopiatechat. We've had a good group coming in which is still growing, with biting wit, naturally ebullient conversationalists, excellent cross-genre musical selections, and just the right admixture of nods and grime. We have a lot of fun, so come check it out. Continue below (or not) for disclaimer and rules:

**this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.**  

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)  


i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1512793701.0

Thats all we can do,"Ive been an opiate(heroin) user for 6+ years, Ive never IVd anything. Never been to jail, never been hospitalized, never lost a job. I wish I could say I never lost a relationship but no matter how close to the chest I play it, rumours abound and people avoid me. It hurts most when former friends constantly keep you at arm's length so to speak, call into question your motives constantly, and just generally make no secret of their lack of trust.

It gets tough going through withdrawals, and the way I use I do it to myself constantly. I tend to use on again, off again, usually 2-3 months at a time (max) and then 2-3+ off, but sometimes I flop back and forth weeks at a time because I cant get a clean streak going. Its tough not having the same support system, even before I was using, just to talk and joke with friends for hours and hours. Its rough not being able to share with many people what im going through. Im lucky to have someone in my life whos there for me but even that only goes so far. 

I need a change man, somethings gotta give. I feel like ive been stuck on a plateau for the passed 2 years just continually stepping forward but making no progress. Ive progressed while using junk, some of my greatest achievements post HS graduation were junked up and mid habit. Idk if its the environment, or the circumstance Im at in my life. I dont know if its even something I can control but im not sitting by and watching myself deteriorate.

Im being proactive. Im taking the right steps. Im an engineer of my personality and can manifest my reality. Ive been lacking in putting that into practice, but thats one of the few universal truths of this life. We are capable of so much, and we use so little of our potential. Lets be real with ourselves -- what are we operating at 25% capacity? 10%? Probably closer to <5%, and im in that category too. Just putting a number on the minutes wasted in a day, even a bullshit ballpark estimate is a sobering statistic. Im putting my money where my mouth is and stepping that number up. Nobody is perfect, nobody is even half perfect. If i can get my ass to 25% capacity I bet results will be unprecedented. And im still going to be chipping,  you better believe it.

He texts back to meet me at some location in the city, the location kinda sucked because I also had to buy some new syringes and the spot he picked wasn't that close to a pharmacy. 

I buy the dope then walk back to the busstop to wait for the bus so I can pick up some rigs. There are close to a dozen pharmacies in my city, I never go to the same one twice in a row.. I rotate pharmacies as often as I rotate injection sites... to keep judgment down.

The one I decided to go to was kinda a new one, it opened a few months ago and I bought syringes there once before. I patiently wait my turn and when  my number appears on the next in queue sign I walk to the counter. I order the usual 29G 12,7mm 1ML syringe and get my wallet out to pay... and then the employee/owner/manager/whatever said no and that they don't sell them over the counter. I explained to her that I've been here before and that a different employee sold rigs to me before, her reply was that she would have a talk with her collegue because it's not their policy to sell syringes with needles.

I left a bit pissed off because of this bullshit, I wanted to shoot up and it started to snow. Didn't have enough time left to go to a different pharmacy except for the one next to the hospital which is open 24/7 but it's at the other side of the city. So I just went home & searched the garbage bag til I found the needle that I threw away this morning and used that one.

Now I'm looking online to see if I can find any laws regarding the sale of medical supplies cause this is kinda bullshit. I've read through several pages of law text and haven't found anything yet.

**Feel free to skip past these examples to cut to the meat of this post.**


**Past examples include:**

* ""30% off normal price when we buy $200 bux in subs, bring the money tonight and I'll get it in the AM.""

* ""I dropped three bags outside, can you give me a couple.""

* ""Loan me three bags and I'll pay you back with interest -- five bags."" After which extra days go by due to circumstances beyond his control(lies, actually).

* Me: I can't spend that much, I need the last $40 for subs. 
  Cliff: I'll cover the subs at the end of the week, I'll make sure I hold on to $40 for that purpose.
  Cliff at the end of the week: We'll see the sub connect tomorrow after 3 when the kids get off school. (tomorrow is saturday, there is no school!)

&nbsp;

###The Meat of this post


In the past when I ordered two buns for me, and two buns for him I'd make a point of spending another $40 to $80 on subs. Each time, inevitably the dboy ""wouldn't be able to get subs"" and the money for subs would go towards getting an additonal bun. So from there we would each have 2.5 buns instead of 2 buns each. 


&nbsp;

Let's just make believe that half a bun is equal to one extra day of getting high on H or at least staying well and not being sick. 


**Is it really worth one extra day worth of dope to run the risk of being dope-sick for a week?** This as opposed to buying subs that would guarantee that neither of us would get sick for over a week.

In just short of 3 months, I have taken so many substances that I feel like Ive fucked myself up for life or at least potentially for months or years. I haven't used Heroin in over 3 weeks. That has been the ultimate goal but I feel absolutely horrible still because of not only how bad I was before quitting, but the other bullshit ive been taking since quitting. I haven't taken Gabapentin in 4 days and I can honestly say using GABA for 2 weeks in high doses fucked me up more than the years of heroin abuse. I'm currently experiencing the most intense and depressing withdrawal I've ever had to go through. Maybe it's also the Xanax I took for 5 straight days last week on top of the clonodine and 2,400 mg of gabapentin a day as well. I also have been smoking an ungodly amount of weed and drank a few too many rum and Cokes after my dad's funeral on Monday.

.        . From mid August to mid November  I was using 1-2 grams of IV heroin( probably cut with fentanyl) and Suboxone in between doses for a couple weeks. I was also smoking crack, popping Xanax and Klonopin on occasion and not sleeping at all. I maybe managed 2 or 3 hours of sleep a night during those few months because I was so fucking high all the time I would constantly fight the urge to sleep just so I could stay up and enjoy my high. It was probably the most unhealthy period of my entire 5 year heroin addiction. 

.      . About three weeks ago I got fired from my job and my life was falling apart. I decided to get clean again but this time around I made many many mistakes in the process that have just caused my suffering to continue until today. I used about 32 mg of Suboxone the first 5 days, then switched to 20-30 grams of Kratom and 10-20 mg of loperamide for another week, and then I made the biggest mistake of all. I went to my doctor and was prescribed Gabapentin, clonodine, and sleeping pills. I also took Xanax for 5 days and have been smoking tons of weed like I mentioned before. 

.       . It's been 4 days since I've taken any gabapentin and about a week and a half since I've had any opiates and I feel like complete shit. I'm still taking about .3 clonodine a day and hydroxyzine at as well as smoking weed. I will have to come off by next week too. I'm assuming I'm going to have rebound hypertension and anxiety from the clonodine and depression, anxiety, and insomnia from the weed. So I'm not even close to feeling better and getting my life back. Fuck me I hate life right now.

So I've been getting into  Podcasts lately, they're good in the background and I know some of you do too (well, one or two certainly). I listen to a few BBC World Service ones, mainly to keep my English up and some of the interviews are great (Hardtalk is brilliant if you've every heard of it). One of the programmes is called 'The Enquiry', each episode looks to answer a question and they do that by getting feedback from 4 'expert witnesses' as they call them. I think it's good listening anyways. 

The latest episode that dropped yesterday happens to be about the Opiod Crisis so I thought a couple of people here might want to give it a listen. They talk about what's happening in America a little, but the actual focus is how America has affected treatment through opiods in other parts of the world, especially poorer parts. If you had to sum the question up I guess it would read more like: 'Why is access to Opiods so unequal'. 

I thought it talked about a side not covered in the media (that I've heard), and might give fellow users something to think about. Here's the [Link](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3csvsyd#play) (It works for me and I'm not in the UK).

7iuhib,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7iuhib/still_clean/,3,https://redd.it/7iuhib,droppingwhen,Still clean,"The 27th I will have been clean for 6 months. My first time into rehab was my last time. My first time getting clean has been a real success story. Not even 1 slip, pain pill wise. I'm now 2 months clean from fucking around with benzos. I'm on methadone, but I considered it clean because I don't even fill the 'done. 



I wanted to come by and tell y'all, it can happen. I also wanted to tell you guys how I did it; I keep looking up stats on lapses for opiates. I want to beat the stats, I don't want to be a stat. I think it's 90 plus per cent of opiate addicts relapse in the first MONTH and just about 100 per cent relapse in the first year. I forgot all of em but I just keep beating the stats and it's making me feel real fucking good and it's helping. So if you're like me, cos this won't help everyone, hell I might be the only one it helps, y'all know how addiction works and shit. Look up stats and get that into your mind that you don't want to be just another statistic. You have to have the mindset of wanting to get clean. 



I smoke a hella amount of weed now, started about 2 months ago because I was about to relapse. So if you're feeling like you're about to relapse, buy weed. Don't buy painers (or h). And going the methadone or sub direction isn't bad. It's actually one of the best ways to go right next to rehab. Don't be afraid to open up to a loved one that you need help and start methadone or bupe. Having family on my side has helped me so fucking much. They make me feel incredible how they're so proud of me being clean and staying that way and going to the clinic every day. It snowed bad as fuck and yet I still went. I don't want to let them down either but more importantly I don't want to let **myself** down ya kno? 



If you guys want any advice on getting clean; detox, rehab, and methadone/bupe, don't be afraid to post. That's the real reason why I thought I'd come here. To say Hi cos it has been a mad minute and I missed y'all and to answer any questions to maybe help one person get clean. It may not be today, it could be in a few years but maybe I helped a little by giving advice publicly. It'll be the hardest thing you'll ever do but becoming opi-free has been the best fuckin' thing I've ever done. ",1512919813.0

I'm fairly new to opiate use. When I had my first batch of H, the effects would last for 2-3h, taking in low doses, and then it would fade out quickly and I'd be back to normal. 

I got my second batch recently, from a different vendor, and taking the same doses, I'm fucked for a good 12+h, and experience very intense side-effects, to the point where at one point I had to call myself an ambulance.

Based on this description, would you think it's just (much) stronger H than last time, or is it perhaps a different substance? Alternatively, could this just be me not responding well for other unknown reasons to it?

If we hear about someone offering a insanely good deal for $500 of dope and have to obtain the money within 3 hours, we will somehow make that $500 in less than 3 hours! Yet, you can give us 1 month  to come up with the minimum payment of $35 for a credit card payment and we are more than likely going to miss the due date and aquire a late fee that costs just as much as the minimum payment and eventually wind up in collections overtime.

I've been on around 4 mg a day for the last year and a half or so. Well the other day I woke up and was bored so i decided for kicks and giggles to shoot 2 mg of sub. Which up intill that point I only did like one or two other times mad long ago when I first got on maintenance.

I got pretty damn high off it. Like I wasn't full blown heroin high but it was damn close as far as euphoria. It lasted a good 40 minute to an hour and continued to feel decent for awhile after that. Well that was like 5-6 days ago at this point and I can't stop shooting them. I haven't experienced anything similar since to the first time but idk it still makes me feel just a little better than normal. Almost normal to what subs feel like but with a little more pep in my step and mood elevation. 

I know a lot of this is probably placebo at this point. But I just enjoy doing it now even without the good euphoric rush I got the first time. I gotta stop before this becomes a real issue and do it for too long. Does anyone know potential risks I'm taking shooting the strips?

You died last week all alone. To be honest the way you used it was bound to happen sooner or later I just wish someone was there to help you. 

We met in rehab. We had both been in multiple rehabs and should have known better that rehab romances don't work out. I guess we were just too attracted to each other.  

I left on a Saturday. On Monday you called me and said you were leaving early and come pick you up. I should have known when I was picking you up at a Burger King and not the rehab something was up. Well you already had a box of 100 rigs and more than a enough dope but we still pawned your iPad and shit that day to get more. You stayed with me for a few days but I couldn't have you there forever so you went back to rehab. I would come to the meetings you were at and bring you dope. One time I got you bars and you ate all 10 in less than a day and got kicked out. What was I thinking letting you come back to stay with me. 

As the months flew by we were spending several thousands a month shooting more and more dope the benefits of you being a rich girl. You also got a prescription again and we were off to the races. 90 Opana 10 IR and 90 Opana 30 er a month. Shoot through that in a week or two then back to dope. 

Eventually shit got out of hand. You saved my life when I was OD on the bathroom floor and not two days later I had to do the same for you. I knew it was a matter of time before we weren't so lucky and didn't have narcan around. I suggested we go to Mexico and do ibogaine as I had already done it about two years prior. You didn't want to stop. I made the decision to go and told you you had to be out when I got back. 

I got back from Mexico and you came through and brought me some dope. I ODed and you saved me again. I had to get away from this so went to rehab in a different part of the state. Away from you. I had to get away to live. While I was there you contacted my mom once to say our mutual friend had died from an overdose and I didn't call you back. I wish I did because now my two best friends I shot dope with everyday while I stayed in Florida are now gone. 

When I got back you were on your way to California going to rehab. Last month the day I got home from yet another detox actually you happened to call me out of the blue saying how well you were doing at rehab and were really going to be try to be sober this time and so should I. 

Well last Sunday you picked up for the last time. I don't know what made you do it but I understand how hard this is to break the cycle. 

It was Tuesday and I was just starting an IV molly binge that lasted a few days when I got the news. I finally fell asleep and when I woke up it all hit me. When you died Sunday night I was still shooting speedballs all alone since Saturday morning. It easily could have been me and not you. The way the universe works I guess. 

Why did you pick up again and why didn't you have someone around. You'll always be in my heart.  RIP LS ",1512874408.0

P.S. there is no use telling me 'just dont get into it man', I love it and despite being sober for so long it is on my mind 24/7. I can also control myself pretty well (so far) in terms of limiting my usage.

She went in over 72 hrs after eating one 120mg MS Contin and she doesn't know what type of UA it is. I've been clean for a few yrs so I still remember my routines and D.O.C.S's but morphine was never one of them.

I told her to basically start looking for a new Dr just in case, cause the last time I failed a UA it was 2 weeks until I got my discharge papers, and had a back up and a way with words so it wasn't in my file. But with the.way things are today, the shit I pulled just 7 yrs ago, ain't gonna fly today.

(Warning: Overly Long Shit Post. üòù),"First off, please allow me to apologize for this, straight up, shit post. (Which I‚Äôm sure will also be waaaaaay too fucking long as I tend to ramble when I‚Äôm lit.) I‚Äôm just so incredibly happy/excited and I had to share it with someone. (And ya‚Äôll are the lucky winners... if you choose to read this post, that is. Yay for you and thank you! üòò)

Anyway, due to some legal issues; and the fact that it just flat out needs to happen, I‚Äôm currently in the process of getting ‚Äúclean‚Äù (no more opies, at least, for this lil‚Äô fella). I‚Äôve been doing pretty good for the  most part over the past 4 months. Of course there have been a few hiccups here and there, but nothing extreme enough to send me rocketing back into active addiction, thank goodness. 

With my blessing (most of these precautions were actually my idea), my friends/family and I have put myself in the position where it‚Äôs damn near impossible for me to pick up at all. (Note the ‚ÄúDAMN NEAR‚Äù, lol.) I don‚Äôt drive myself anywhere and my location can be seen at any time via the phone. So, I pretty much 100% rely on my friends and family to have me where I need to be when I need to be there, and absolutely nowhere else. ü§ê

Now, even though I am truthfully trying to get clean, I‚Äôm still a messy, complicated drug addict. In a little over a week I‚Äôll be getting another Vivitrol shot and I‚Äôll really gonna begin to work an Outpatient program. So, naturally, I‚Äôve been becoming obsessed with a ‚Äúone last time‚Äù opiate high. However, I have exactly TWO plugs whom both live an hour away in the closest big city. (I very much live out in the country.) Thus, you can see how utterly hopeless my ‚Äúone last fix‚Äù dream really is. üôÑ

And that, my friends, FINALLY brings us to why my main d-boy is so fucking awesome. Quick bit of info on my mans, while he IS a licensed driver, he VERY RARELY has access to a vehicle. For the past week or so I‚Äôve been trying to come up with a way to pick up before fully delving into ‚Äútotal‚Äù sobriety but it wasn‚Äôt until today that I finally figured something out. However, I knew it was gonna be a pain in the ass for him, thus making it a long shot... but it was my ONLY shot so I had to go for it. ü§≠

So, I text my dude this morning (He already knew that I wasn‚Äôt able to make it down to him.) asking, well more like begging, that he go along with my plan. Luckily I had some $$$ saved up; so I knew that wasn‚Äôt gonna be a problem. (I even offered to pay him an extra $100 for his troubles, but he wouldn‚Äôt take it!)

Instead of detailing my entire plan (Lord knows that this rambling shit post/show has gone on long enough already. Oopsy.) I‚Äôll just tell you guys that, after working a 12 hour shift as a line cook (He legit got ‚Äúbored‚Äù from slinging drugs for so many years and became a cook at TGI Friday‚Äôs  about 6 months ago. Craziness, eh? LOL.) ANYWAY, that patron saint of a drug dealer took his exhausted ass and hopped in an Uber (Which I paid for, naturally.) and set out on the two hour round-trip journey, which began at 11:30 pm, all just to hook me up. How fucking awesome is that?! ü§©

Alrighty, all, I think that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got for ya!! Again, I do apologize for this extremely long-winded, rambling, shit post. I just HAD to share my excitement with someone! And when I‚Äôm fucked up, words just seem to fall out of my mouth and I find myself completely unable to edit them. LOL. My B!! For those of you crazy enough to read through all of this, thank you SO much for sharing in my quasi-celebration with me. Also, I hope you found the read at least somewhat enjoyable/entertaining. And if not.... meh. üòè LOL.

Thanks again! I hope ya‚Äôll have a beautiful, nod-filled, rest of your night!

TLDR; I‚Äôm currently unable to leave my house without EVERYONE knowing where I am. So my INCREDIBLE d-boy used a car service (Which I obviously paid for.) to make the TWO HOUR round trip, at damn near midnight, which was after he finished a 12 hour shift at his new day job, just to hook my sorry ass up. (He also refused to accept an extra $100 from me for his troubles.) In short, he‚Äôs pretty much the best there is. You can totally be jeally! üòé

EDIT: I spelled ‚Äútoo‚Äù as ‚Äúto‚Äù in here once and that is... UN. üëè FUCKING. üëè ACCEPTABLE. üëè

You guys can't even imagine how good this shot just felt.  I have a heavy-ass habit, and I hadn't had anything since Wednesday afternoon.  I'm entirely broke right now, the 2 20s I got were a trade for a couple gs of bud, and I'm pretty sure I finished my 320 mile round trip with literally 7 miles worth of gas still in my tank. 
 But in an absolutely unheard of display of self-control, for once, I was able to refrain from shooting up in the first gas-station bathroom I could find after I copped.  So imagine being sick for 4 days, driving 2 1/2 hours, copping, and then driving 2 1/2 hours home, still sick.  I felt like the dope was actually burning a hole in my pocket, the last 20 miles or so felt like an absolute eternity.

I'm not sure there are words to express the relief and satisfaction that washed over me when I finally got into my bathroom and pushed off.  After 4 days of sweating and tossing and turning in bed, barely able to muster the motivation and energy to go use the bathroom...I finally feel human again. And I even hit on my first try, a true Festivus Miracle!

Now I feel more than ready to fuck this exam up, and since I don't have a ton of dope, I'll most likely take advantage of my motivation and knock out the paper I have due for Wednesday.  With that done I'll have one exam left which isn't until the 18th, so I'll have enough time to kick.

Hope everyone else is safe and well, with extra good vibes going out any fellow students out there!  I can't imagine trying to study for and take a set of difficult finals while I was sick, so I hope none of you have been forced into an impromptu detox!",1512979088.0

On the plus side I chip. Maybe use once or twice a week. Is there any reason why I often can't register when I know for certain the tip of my needle is right in the vein? Like I'm talking its a big visible vein and I've felt the resistance that tells you you've punctured the vein. I know I didn't break through the other side because I've pushed further and felt it break through after I'd initially pulled back on the plunger and failed to register. This often happens on my elbows following a successful shot. I'd hate to think my veins are that bad that my damn elbow veins get so damaged after one shot that they don't register on the second one. On these occasions when I'm short on time and I know I'm in the vein, just no blood and Ive pushed down the plunger. Oddly I'd say if it's say a 6 bag shot, I'll feel like I registered and had the rush of a 2 or 3 bag shot. Definitely different feeling than when you miss and just basically get the slow IM feeling. Just odd to me especially considering the last part.

Any opinions or advice will be appreciated. Oh and btw, wish me the best on Wednesday. I have a violation of probation hearing. I'm only on level 2 and my PO said he'd ask for a continuance so the hearing takes place after the shoplifting charge that actually violated me. Worst case scenario hopefully is the judge denies it and bumps me to level 3 which would suck because then in a couple months when the shoplifting hearing comes I'd probably get a little time in jail again. Normally a shoplifting charge would get you maybe 30 days here but I've got 8 years backup time so if the judge feels like being a dick and throws the book at me I could end up doing around a quarter of my backup time which would be 2 years.

i got clean for a year after eightish years of pill and heroin use. relapsed, and this time around subs are not the lifesaver they used to be. i think i've managed to learn how to avoid the pwd every time now, cause that was a new problem as well.


but they just don't take all the sickness away. they definitely make me feel better, just not 100%. if i eat like two whole strips i get relief for a really short amount of time, maybe six hours max. four mg used to have me set for a full 24 hours. and that's during heavier use than now. 


anyway, im high and rambling but we've been trying to hop off dope and stick to subs for a few months now and we cave everytime cause we feel like complete shit. when the subs are effective it eliminates cravings, duh that's the point, but when you're on 12mg and still feel like poop, it's hard. willpower is hard.


my question is: would kratom with the suboxone take the edge off? i'm fairly confident if we could stay on the damn things our tolerance or whatever would level out and we'd be gravy. the longest we've managed to go is eight days. we're both fairly motivated to get off this shit, super tired of being broke. plus today's the first time in a while that we've gotten shit that does more than keep us unsick.


so. would kratom be effective in combination with suboxone, and if not are there any suggestions for our predicament?

I need 3mg Oxycodone for a nice warm buzz and 5mg for a really strong nod (oral or nasal use). Same with Tilidin. I need around 30-40mg for a really sedating buzz.

He lights a Newport short, a couple drags he takes

He looks to his love, but she's still asleep

""I'm gonna go cop now hun, those percs you can keep""

Looking at his dirty spoon, he ponders a cooker before he goes

Kissing her cold face goodbye, pulls the blanket to cover her toes

Hopping 2 fences, he stops at the corner store

Grabs a loaf of bread, but wishes he could buy more

Weaving his was through the projects, all the buildings look the same

Completely lost in his head, he steps in between the drops of rain

He cops and goes home, "" I got ya one too hun""

"" I didn't get my rock tho, I'll have to go on another run""

He tears open the wax paper, mere moments from heaven

The plunger hits home, the opiates flood in

He lays on the bed, but his worries don't show

He wraps his arms around her, whispers ""please don't go""

Tim reawakens, it's almost dinner time

"" I'm gonna do your bag now* hun, I hope u don't mind""

He burrows through the empty cabinets, ""PB and J it is""

""I made you one too babe, I'll bring it if you give me a kiss""

Both sandwiches lay untouched, he sits pondering which way

Tries not to see the obvious, the inevitability he tries to delay

He picks up the phone, ringing for some rock

Pushing the stem while he waits, he glances at the clock

9 clock p.m. when the dealer drops it off

Takes his first true hit of the day, followed by his 30th cough

The crumbs are quickly burned, soon the streets will learn

The story of Tim's Thanksgiving, soon the streets will learn

He goes through her drug box, making sure they're all gone

Finishes off the last of em, not leaving a single one

He covers her with another blanket, but she's probably still cold

Nothing left of value in his life, everything has been taken or sold

"" You better wake up baby, I'm about to call""

"" I don't think I can make it, who will catch me when I fall?""

He grabs the phone, sits beside her, not knowing what to say

So I have a question regarding an experience that recently happened, contemplating whether or not I OD'd. I just kinda shrugged it off initially, but the more I think about it.. the more it bugs me if I'm receiving fent or not. I've been buying off this d boy for about 4 months now so it makes me question, why now? Time adds context for me & confuses me in this instance. 

I had just got back from a date, already high as fuck, luckily I didn't nod in front of her, I felt great. 
I came home & my lovely little stash, it feels as if my heart is grinning to the external world now instead of emptiness because I have some left. 
I began snorting it & I was smoking marijuana, back to back blunts, I kept snorting away & I still had some left.. it was the strongest fucking nod I've experienced in my entire opiate journey. I slowly put my head back & slowly it all just became blank. I don't know how long I was sitting there honestly.. I woke up eventually confused, breathing in deep. The first thought in my mind was did I just almost die? I just sat there in shock, wondering if ""God"" or some higher entity led me to this point to learn & get another chance but I'm not even sure. The closest I could explain the feeling is when you wake up from anesthesia, just wondering what the fuck just happened & how you got there.

 Essentially I'd appreciate any opinions, was I just nodding hard as hell, or do you believe I was close to dying? Thank you. ",1512931520.0

Also side question if you crush up one 80 with 4 20mg IR and snort it does it effect the high. I ask because if you snort an 80 by itself the high takes longer to quick in but last longer compared to an 80 mixed with 20mg.",1513073421.0

I personally have tried quite a few differing medicines to help and I‚Äôll list the ones that were actually effective. 

Loperamide: helps quite a bit with the gastrointestinal tract symptoms of withdrawal. Very minor decrease in cravings. Major decrease of restless leg syndrome but not perfect. Zero help with insomnia. Use as last chance help since it‚Äôs not very effective overall and has a chance of doing severe heart damage. 

Butalbital, caffeine, cpap: no help with physical side effects of withdrawal, but minor decrease in cravings. 

Mirtazapine: very very effective with physical symptoms of withdrawal. Decreases restless leg syndrome to nearly zero, decreases itchy skin feeling, can also defeat insomnia if you normally don‚Äôt take it. Does not help with gastrointestinal symptoms. 

Agmatine: doesn‚Äôt help much with the symptoms of withdrawal, but continues to help lower tolerance. So it slowly lowers the symptoms as well as making your next opiate dose stronger. 

Kratom: helps with all physical symptoms of withdrawal including gastrointestinal. Also helps with cravings to a small extent and can help with chronic pain if you are self medicating.

Ondensatron: helps with vomiting and slightly reduces craving. 

My ‚Äúsilver bullet‚Äù that helped me through an unexpected and unwanted withdrawal of five days was red kali kratom and mirtazapine. Take that for what you will, I was mostly able to do my normal stuff. Still had a ton of cravings, but I was able to survive. And able to sleep, so that was amazing. Slept through a lot of the withdrawal. ",1513059042.0

I live in Europe, and all the heroin i can get here is heroin base, 
I like to smoke it on foil.
I recently accuired some supposedly aprox 90% pure heroin#3 from dnm. 
His last batch was lab testes to 92% and this batch was supposedly just as good. 
It Even had the link to the lab test, and his reviews were really really positive. 
I an not a Heavy user-, I use maybe once or twice a months, 
Usually I Can easily smoke 0.5g of the stuff i get at home in an evening. 
But 50mg og this smoked over 3 hours had me nodding like a mofo.And the euphoria was absolutly amazing. And each hit gave men incredible rush!
 It was some Next level shit.
But i noticed that my teeth got really sticky when i smoked it.
Is this normal for high purity heroin? Or is It becuse of something else? Thanks in advance",1513040206.0

I detoxicated a few years ago, and after 7 months with Suboxone I found kratom, and that change my life to incredibly better than before. 

But I'm passing a hard time in my life now, specially for the fact that I think that my girlfriend and me broke yesterday, after a long period of crisis and break up 3 times. And the last week I lost the control:  somedays I smoked fentanyl, another day I snorted hydromorphone and another days oxy. I think if wasn't the entire week (wich would probably), at least 6 days.

Now sometimes I'm in withdrawal, the Saturday night I took 15mg of oxy divided in the night. Nothing since then except kratom, that really helps a lot, but sometimes the withdrawal kick in hard.

Now I'm studying a course and I cannot allow have withdrawal in class, because they would send me to my home. I have a few blisters of Suboxone 2mg (buprenorphine/naloxone), the question is: this could me help to manage the withdrawal if became worse? I can combine it with kratom and have effects? There are differents opinions about this case for here and bluelight. I take low doses, 5-6g per day is good for me and for my pain.

What would do you recommend me guys? Thanks in advance. ",1513039494.0

While the nurses struggled to sedate me, two lesbian tweakers were driving my car around in a city I hate and I ended up eit h a bunch of free meth.","If anyone remembers my job post, I get my first check on the 20th, so until then I have been continuing the ridiculous and unstable activity of street running to get money. An adventure every day and/or night. 

So last night I was with these two girls who I call my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo. We've all helped each other beyond what's necessary, put a lot on the line for each other, etc. I fucking love these girls. It seems like the world is always trying to pry them apart, and no matter how hopeless they always hold on. It's one of the most beautiful relationships I've ever seen and I do everything in my power to help keep them together and keep them both alive. Late last night we had some deals set up in the big city in the county over, we had to make a stop in a town on the way there and overall come out with good profit and a decent amount of shard. I was going to keep my cash and sell my shard, I try not to fuck it with it often these days because I need money more than I need more problems. We end up at this kids house in the town on the way to the city, we had a bunch of stupid shit that he wanted and was going to trade us heroin for it (still digusted by and clean off heroin, we needed it to set up for a bigger deal in the city). After awhile of negotiation we get a good deal, he almost burns his house down and we leave. On the way to my car I slipped on icy pavement and tried to catch myself on the back of the kids car with my right arm. Going down and suddenly trying to rapidly propel my body weight back up using only my right arm... I guess has potential to really fuck you up. Who knew? 

It's horrible pain, but I move past it. We get in the car and head to the gas station, and I find I can't use the arm at all. It's whatever, yeah it hurts like a cruel cunt but this shouldn't take long and I'll deal with it when I get where I'm staying. Minute by minute the pain in my shoulder and arm is rapidly progressing in intensity, one of the girls sees I'm clearly struggling and offers to drive. I let her. We go get gas and I just can't take it. It's excruciating. I can't think, I'm about to pass out from the pain, and it's so bad it's making my body tremble. We all agree I should go to the ER. On the way there I told them the hustle must go on, you girls take my car to the city, perform the tasks we must meet and come back and visit me. It takes about 10 minutes to get me out of the backseat into a wheelchair. You guys I'm no bitch but my Jesus fucked up Christ it was terrible pain. 

Gonna try to make the rest short. Haven't touched opiates since I got clean and don't want to. As soon as they get me in a room I tell them I'm a former heroin addict and do not want opiates until all other options are exhausted. They congratulate me and do what they can do. With all other pain killers being equally effective for pain as a soggy bagel would be, they say if I want the pain to stop we'll need to use narcotics. I agree. 2 doses of IV dilaudid later and... It didn't do dick. Pain is just as it was and still getting worse. I'm cussing like a sailor all the way through x rays. After that I get a suprise visitor, so I call my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo and tell them to take my car to their place so they can get home and rest, I'll keep them updated and grab the car in the morning. 

Shoulder was dislocated, they said it hurt some muscles and there's probably nerve damage from tearing, one of the worst they've seen. Great, now pop that bitch in place so I can go make ends meet. 

One dose of anesthesia

2 doses of anesthesia 

> You feeling sleepy yet?

> No things are kinda weird though. I have a good headchange. Look if it's faster to just amputate I'm down. 

3 doses of anesthesia

> You're seriously still up? Do you know what's happening? 

> Yeah you guys aren't compensating enough for my body's norm being intoxication. Definitely getting real loopy but this is breakfast to me. 

3.5 doses of anesthesia

> wait the fentanyl isn't for me right? 

> Nope. 

It was definitely for me. 1 dose of fentanyl topped off with 2 doses of ketamine and I'm out like a junkies happiness on a family holiday. I always thought anesthesia was just you taking a nap and then you wake up not remembering details and the work done. Nope. You guys that shit is so fucking trippy. Like holy fuck I can't even describe it, it was so lit though I would definitely do it again. I've done a lot of acid but that was the trippiest thing I have ever experienced hands down. 

So yeah my favorite girls completed the mission and I had someone take me to where I'm staying at like 3:30 in the morning. Went to the girls house this morning to get my car back. They gave me my cut of the cash and meth. When I got my car to my place, I assessed damage and they spilled shards of meth FUCKING EVERYWHERE. EVERYWHERE. Like seriously it doesn't even seem fair. I don't know how much they got in total but it must have been enough for them to not give a fuck. 

Good times. Can't wait to get paid so I can get away from street bullshit. I'm not sure how to feel about the opiates in a medical setting. Ideally I don't want to take them under any circumstances, but I had to relieve that pain. I don't feel triggered, I don't feel like using, but I'm still worried as to what that might do in regards to stimulating my opioid receptors causing subconscious opiate driven thought processes. But Saturday will be 8 weeks and you bet your ass I'll make it there. Then deal with the struggles of week 9. Brush myself off and start on double digits.

(And a story of a year wasted on oxy),"Went on a couple month oxy binge (after chipping on and off for probably 9/12 of the last months. This recent go around i was starting around 90-120mg/day and peaking around 300mg/day when i could afford that much :0

Got clean for a week with the use of dones for the first 3 days, 30mg/day just to get me
Through the worst of the oc detox, it wasn‚Äôt hard at all w/the dones...and only mentally hard after.

Went back to oxy for a couple weeks, stopped w/4mg sub a day for 4 days and then stopped and was totally clean for another week until I had a nerve being pinched again which was the last excuse I needed to go back for another week

Now I‚Äôve been on 30-50mg of methadone for the last week and I‚Äôm ready to stop, they almost feel too good? I wasn‚Äôt getting as high as i wanted to even w high dosages of oxy toward the end (120mg at a time of IR at times, 160 mg OP at times), but 30-40mg of methadone makes me extremely content and motivated...way cheaper than spending 90-300/day on oxy, more like $20/day for 40mg methadone. I know it‚Äôs horrendous to get off of if you take it long term so my time has come to face sober reality again 


Will I experience w/d from methadone or just some return of PAWS?


The only reason I‚Äôm quitting is due to the absolutely ignorant waste of hard earned money that it entails...I still love that feeling and don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúover it‚Äù yet...I feel like most people would‚Äôve switched to heroin a while ago in my shoes (not much regular  income , most all of which goes toward the pills when I‚Äôm on them. H is so much cheaper and I‚Äôve smoked it twice and honestly thought it was lacking compared to a strong oxy high. (I know it was good BTH, also-but there‚Äôs starting to be fent in BTH too...). Oxy is like a euphoric stimulant for me, H just never fully fills that feeling i seek, last time I kept hitting the foil until next thing I know I‚Äôm coming-to knelt down by my bed. Apparently I passed out before I could reach where I wanted to go mentally... I just felt fucked up and lethargically numb (but not in a crazy awesome way...). 

At least I‚Äôm not doing or care to do heroin anymore ...right...? The mental haunting that follows you around feels like it‚Äôs never gonna go away again. I‚Äôve gone months clean and still have dreams of doing oxy and it‚Äôs so realistic that I feel that long lost feeling and wake up wondering where more of that feeling (my drugs) are. Then I remember it was a dream and want nothing more than to actually feel that warm blanket come over me again...it‚Äôs ruined the last year of my life...it may as well have just Not happened...it feels like maybe 2 blurry months. I moved 6 times. I‚Äôm in debt to friends in family and have lost most of my close relationships due to lack of contact . I‚Äôm dull and pretty much void of interest/energy/motivation..

The depression is just too much to handle eventually when a Shit storm in life starts brewing :/ just took an op80 and 120mg
Roxy and won‚Äôt b getting more, I barely feel it üò≥üòû

Will I ever feel fucking normal again? Because it‚Äôs starting to feel hopeless. I wasn‚Äôt happy before I did  any type of drugs, either... I‚Äôve also done therapy for 3 years (6 years ago...and I was on benzos for most of time so I didn‚Äôt recall or register half of that .

Funny thing is fentanyl been in Aus for years - particularly on the DNMs. Albeit only ever sold as fent. The newspaper article made out that it just went BANG - fent laced heroin now awash on the streets. 10 overdose deaths in the span of a week in the suburb of Richmond (ground zero for cold copping in Melbourne) alone. 
And all the experts say this is only the beginning... 
i‚Äôm aware 10 ods is just NOTHING compared to what you poor souls in the states are dealing with on a daily basis. 
The article said that your in the grip of the worst opioid epidemic in history. It‚Äôs just that we went from 0 deaths EVER! To 10 in a week. From something that was previously unheard of...

It seems the days of paradise here were we bought heroin - and every time, it was in fact just heroin, are now over :( Test shots and test kits will now need to be embraced by users. Narcan is not widely distributed over here yet either. I wonder how many people will have to die before they wise up with its regulation and freer distribution

In my last previous post I was discussing the fact that today I had obtained 2xoc 80s - since determined to be fake and prolly fent.. seriously, I know this is nothing new for you guys. But, even as little as a few months ago that was completely unheard of here!

I want to start out by saying that the shit my plug gets is very consistent, with respect to potency. He buys straight from the runners that are associates of the cartel, so the quality is always the same. My plug contacts me this week saying that he can now get BTH that is twice as potent for only a 25% price increase. 

I'm like ""how did you pull this off."" He said that he got in the Mexican runner's car and the runner, who speaks very little English, said ""clean or dirty."" And he was like ""what the hell, you never said I had options before. I want the clean shit."" 

Well sure enough, the stuff was twice as potent. I did 0.2 instead of my normal 0.4 and I was feeling great. The stuff might have even been better than twice as good. Anyway the shit is so good, I immediately get more the next day.

Well I loaded up 0.22 or so, and I felt well but not high. I was like ""shit, he got the dirty batch."" I start to look at my arm and notice it is a bit raised near the injection site. I think to myself: ""maybe I missed and skin popped it by accident."" But I remembered registering, so I shrugged it off.

A few hours later I load up another shot, but this time I put in like 0.32. I'm not 100% convinced that I didn't miss the previous shot, but I'm pretty confident, so I don't do my normal 0.4 to be safer.

Well within seconds of pushing the plunger down, I feel the hit, but it is an order of magnitude or more than usual. And this time it is combined with a feeling of nausea. I'm saying to myself ""oh shit, I wish I still had some glass to hit right now to counteract this, because I am in for the ride and there is no way off."" And that is all I remember.

Next thing I recall, I'm sitting up in my car, in the parking lot I was in. I'm sweating bullets, super nauseated, and I have a horrific headache. I look at the clock and forty minutes had passed. 

The nausea finally gets me and I open my car door and vomit out the side. I spend the next 15 minutes piecing together what had happened. I figure my seat belt might have saved my life, by keeping me sitting upright and breathing. I think the horrific headache was from a lack of oxygen getting to my brain possibly.

FIRST AND FOREMOST: THE GOLPIATE RULE, OR GOLDEN OPIATE RULE. IT SAYS 
""IF YOU ARE AN ACTIVE OPIATE USER OR HARM REDUCTION ENTHUSIAST, DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ACQUIRE SOME FORM OF NARCAN/NALOXONE, AND BECOME EDUCATED ON OVERDOSE AND HOW TO HELP REVERSE IT WITH THE USE OF NARCAN/NALOXONE OR LEARN HOW TO PROLONG LIFE AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE UNTIL PROPER MEDICAL HELP ARRIVES."" 

Seriously guys, even at the most basic level of hands on research or even at least reading about and watching videos of how to administer CPR/prolong life for as long as possible. If you are a user or around users, it can, and WILL make a difference, potentially of life or death. 


Talk about a scary surreal eye opening experience. She was a new user but insisted that she wanted to IV. Hey, adults can make their own decisions, but I advise strongly against the idea explaining my reasoning, such as drug interactions and the very real chance for an OD. While talking about OD I figured a good time to teach a new user about narcan or naloxone injectable version, so I brought out my small .4mg/1ml vial of naloxone and a 25g needle. I explain the signs and what to look for, how to determine if it's a nod or an OD, how to determine the severity, and what steps to taking in the case of the incident. Call 911, provide location, administer first dose of narcan and begin CPR rescue breathing no compressions. Administer consecutive doses at 5 and 10 minutes if no response or not enough improvement. Figure make sure she understood in the off chance she ever has to potentially save one and has access to it which probably is pretty slim, but hey, look where I am. 

Quick note: few months ago my friend and partner gave me a single dose .4mg/1ml vial of liquid naloxone with a IM syringe in a kit that looked to have been administered at a harm reduction convention, it too had brief instructions on how to handle the event. 

Now the story. We are in my room getting high and I tell her how I shoot and she wants to watch and think about trying it again. I do my shot and proceed to answer her questions and inform her of any knowledge I have that I thought important, with consistent reminders that it's a bad idea and I advise against it, but I'm not one to lie so yes it does feel great but, in exchange for later feeling bad

She ponders and still decides she wants to try. She tells me about her tolerance and I from what she says I figure we try a .05 shot of some okay tar. My tolerance isn't even insane and I've shot up to .25 of it. Her veins are EXTREMELY hard to hit but I finally register on her forearm, and she moved after about 40-60% went in so a small amount missed but I couldn't stop in time because it wasn't even like 30 units of water in the whole shot. Clean it up and tell her to wait it out and reassure her the miss is okay it will just hurt a little like a bruise. About an hour and a half to two hours later she wants to try again. My high had finished by now, she never visually looked with with no nod or slur or anything, so I figured sure. I stated she would go first in case I needed to provide any assistance which was pretty unlikely. I thought. She wants to do a bigger shot. I say absolutely not and prepare another .04-.05 shot. Register much easier and hit perfectly. Now she says she starts to feel it. Sits back a little and I'm talking while prepping my shot and soon after she stopped responding I look over to her. *says name* no response *louder* no response, stop for one second, check pulse and breathing, and determined this an overdose.   Call 911 and provide address and details, advise to hold off on dispatching an ambulance just yet(wanted to avoid the law if possible but would not risk her life)Knowing how strong inj naloxone is and how small the dose was I figured I would not need the whole dose. I draw a third of naloxone out and give a IM shoulder injection. Wait the longest two minutes ever while checking for breathing. Near non existent and far apart, slowing down. Administer dose 2 shoulder INJ. Breathing has now stopped, began CPR rescue breathing (breath for them every 5 seconds). After a few breaths two gasps and some self breathing, but slowed back to a stop. Administered final and full dose of narcan after a few more breaths a few more gasps came and she began self breathing again. Shortly came to be able to respond to sentences and say words but couldn't remember what had happened. Clearly couldn't fully comprehend ehat had happened and didnt believe she was actually dead until I showered her the narcan vial and lectured her. 

What I want you to take from this is simple. Be PREPARED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE. should I not had that naloxone and educate myself, she absolutely would have died if paramedics weren't fast enough. If i didn't have naloxone to administer I would immediately request the ambulance no matter what and follow up with CPR rescue breathing until they arrive. After her confession I explained that why you dont bang heroin if it's only your third time when you've been drinking on xanax just because you like the guy youre hanging out with. That's a good message to take too. 

Wow. Still hard to wrap my head around it 

Edit:spelling, words, tldr, new golpiate rule. 

TL;DR: Hanging out w new girl, shoots, ODs and is dead at one point, brought her back to life with three separate doses of injectable naloxone and CPR rescue breathing for... I'm not sure how long. It felt like 5-7 min I had to breath for her, and she was probably unconscious for about 20 min total. Stressing the importance of being prepared and supplied, educated, and TAKING ACTION.

Been awhile, in need of a lil advice regarding the ‚Äòbonus goodies‚Äô that came with my dark net market purchase üò≥","So me and 4 mates are going to see Muse play in a few days. As usual the burden to get some gear for such special occasions falls on the biggest drug pig of our group - me. So we pool our cash and order a whole bunch of coke off the dark net markets - which has since arrived. On weight and quality blow - no problems there. Anyways with the small amount of btc left over I decide to order just 25mg of my past lover - fentanyl, to be put into a nasal spray bottle. I figure a little sedating after a huge night on the stims and booze will be the perfect night cap. So my 25mg of fentanyl powder arrived today. But with a bonus of 2 OC 80s. Quite the bonus considering oxy in Aus is just stupid expensive - almost as bad as coke! Lol. In fact 2 OC 80s would be nearly twice as much as what the actual fent order cost! So I take one look at them and realise they ain‚Äôt from a pharmacy. The OC is printed HUGE on the pill and not centered. While they are green. It‚Äôs not a straight thick waxy green. More like a light green with speckles in it. They actually look more like ecstasy pills than oxy pills. I grab some scissors to cut one in half expecting that ‚Äòresistance‚Äô you usually get from them and will almost no force it just crumbles away revealing the same shade of green throughout the whole pill. No white on the inside whatsoever. I‚Äôve questioned the vendor hoping to get any info I can on em but no response. Yet at least... Considering how dangerous fent can be in unknown doses (my nasal spray mixtures are always spot on to the Milligram/mL) is there any safe way of finding out what i‚Äôm in for if I consume any amount of these? Honestly i‚Äôm thinking of just flushing them. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here remembers me but I‚Äôve been clean from opis for a good long while now and would have next to no tolerance. I‚Äôm also lucky enough to be in a position where I don‚Äôt crave them enough to say fuck it and just chance unknown doses of ANY opiate - let alone fucking fent! I just want to go see one of my favourite bands with my mates and have a good time - not fucking die! If I got ahold of some kinda test kit could it tell me exactly what they are and how much of it? Or do they only tell that it is, say fent - but not how much or how strong it is. Lastly, it‚Äôs been a long time, just wanna say I hope your all doing well. Especially anyone neck deep in the game. Any advice as always is much appreciated from my favourite bunch of drug pigs that have never met me but somehow know me better than I know myself. Stay safe and god bless every last one of you beautiful scumbags!;)",1513147849.0

Myself, I don't, I find it pointless, even with BTH. The only reason to do it, is to make it breakdown faster, which you can do with friction. Now that I just did ECP, I boiled it down, simply because I thought that's what you do with ECP to ""release"" more of the good stuff (IDK).


I got into an arguement with a friend, whether or not cold shots are dangerous, etc.


I always used this page as my source:
https://www.heroinhelper.com/user/admin/cold_shot.shtml



TLDR: I find boiling up a shot to be pointless, if anything wasteful. Is there any actual benefit to boiling shots? Or is this just a thing they do in movies to signify ""oooh he's a bad guy!"" kind of moment?


Just curious! I'll keep a running total in this post.

I've been there. I am also in active addiction. I get it. It's quite a mess, constantly. If they don't hate each other, they love each other too much. Typical junkie love shit.

She lives with me. He thinks he lives with us. Typical pain in the ass living with a couple but it goes beyond that. I come home to screaming and yelling most days which I am unfortunately used to. I guess he tried crack a few weeks back and has been binging like crazy and last night.... shit got physical.

When I got home, she said she came home to E locked in the basement and she said she could almost smell burning rubber or something close. She was trying to get into the basement because E was ignoring her when E busted out of the basement knocking the door into her. I guess she swatted him ""in a playful way"" were her words but I wasn't there. She told me things escalated very quickly and it was like flipping a switch. One minute he was somewhat concerned he may have hit her with the door, the next he was shoving her against the wall. I guess he smacked her in the head pretty hard and got in her face about ""personal space"" and bullshit before retreating to the basement, assumedly to use more crack.

When I got home I found E in the still locked basement, and could smell what K smelled, definitely crack. K was in her room visibly upset and she told me everything that happened SO MILDLY like it was no big deal? That's physical abuse. And emotional abuse. 

I know it's not my place to step in. I also can't let my roommate get hurt. Anyone ever been here? I need major advice on what to do. I am wary about calling the police because unless something is actively going on I am pretty sure they can or won't do anything, and that's not the route I'd like to take anyhow. Is there anything I can do? Aside from talking sense into her because that's been quite difficult.


Update:     I had a long talk with both my roomie and her bf. I told them both that what happened that night was insane. They sat together HAND IN HAND and apologized! I stopped K right there. I said ""No, I want the apology from E to me AND YOU and then maybe he can come back if he can prove he's not going to bring trouble into our house"". K actually heard what I was saying and stepped back too, saying the same shit. If E doesn't get his shit together, he isn't welcome back. He will also NOT be here overnight until I feel K is safe.

My connect was getting them consistently starting in March and she liked me so much she'd only sell them to me.  Needless to say I developed quite the habit.  Gotta say those 6 months were bliss.  Fast forward to the end of September and turns out the connect was taken off them, no longer getting a monthly script.  Sure, they still sold plenty blues and 80s but man oh man what a letdown to go back to oxycodone after a half year of the holy grail.  Like it wasn't doing jack.  I know I was spoiled but I actually took the whole situation as a sign to get sober.  

Just before the connect was cut off I saw the first articles on Endo complying with the FDA's request to take Opana off the market.  I was crushed but I still can't wrap my head around how the generics were still on the market... I mean I'd take the G series over the brand name any day and twice on Sundays because they are easier to use.  Anyway I just read an article the other day on how Scott Gottleib, commissioner of the FDA and the one who spoke out against Opana, said they are also reviewing the generics that are still on the market and furthermore said that the generic er form of oxymorphone has the highest abuse rate of any opioid on the market.  

Reading these things just led me to some shower thoughts... To me, this seems to say it's only a matter of time before the G series is pulled as well.  I think they're living on borrowed time.
I truly think we will all look back on Opana and its generic formulations years or decades from now and view the time when it was on the market as the good ol' days.  Future generations will never know what they missed out on, kinda like how young generations right now have no concept of what Quaaludes feel like, we just know it was a legendary drug many ppl loved and abused that is now no longer in production.

Some addicts said their dope addiction started with pills. Enough ppl said it to take notice. The remedy? Educate doctors to monitor and educate  patients, TAPER at the end, and don't treat them like addicts or cut them off  because they've been taking a prescription for six months and are now dependent. Continue the treatment until no longer needed, then TAPER. ( You know, like docs do with antidepressants. But those patients don't get treated like shit, do they?)


BUT NO. The ""drug war"" started cracking down on doctors and pharmacists who started cutting ppl off (esp those who rightfully needed those meds), didn't properly taper and left them on their own. 

Many got their pills from the street. Except, now all these ppl are in possession of ""illegal"" prescriptions, nvm that they need them and we're cut loose from the doc. So the govt/media say ""opioid abuse is on the rise! And crack down ever more, prosecuting doctors who are now terrified to write scripts. This reduces the supply of pills on the Street.

Now those pain patients and weekend drug users have no choice but to get heroin. Guess what happens now? Now they get strung out on dope. 

And the govt/media cry, ""Heroin is an epidemic!""

So many new junkies now that supply can't meet demand. Enter Asian chemical suppliers, dealers who have no possible way of cutting it safely, and WHAM, death after death after death.

The whole while the media is spreading the bullshit putting more pressure on law enforcement, who cause more pressure on the docs/users, whos statistics end up feeding more media bullshit...round and round it goes. 

Buts let's keep demonizing opioids because I'm sure the NEXT cycle won't end up in even more harm and death.

Basically Ive been off the shit for 7 months now and it‚Äôs the longest time I‚Äôve ever had clean since I started using any substances ever. I‚Äôm in great shape, the gym has really helped me in terms of keeping myself busy, bettering myself and setting goals. (Gained 60 pounds since detox lol) but I can‚Äôt help but feeling bored still. I miss the life in a way. Not just opiates but making money serving treesand just being free to do as I please. I hate working a normal job, I hate being broke, I miss the excitement. I was so passionate about marijuana and wanted to get into the business one day so badly, even went to culinary school to learn how to make quality edibles and what not. Just got sucked into dope bad this time. Had dabbled a bit in the past but really developed a habit this last run. Had plenty of money to spend on it from flipping packs so I wasn‚Äôt really sick until I decided to stop due to shit just getting way to crazy and developing some what of a bar habit on top of my dope habit lol. I guess my question really is should I just stick to being a normie and keep pushing forward or just say fuck it and make an attempt at casually smoking and drinking possibly a few extra curricular activities in the mix ;). Or even just trapping bud a lil bit. I honestly felt alive when i was working with bud and felt like it‚Äôs what I wanted to be a part of professionally (legally) one day. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. Can‚Äôt really get crazy into aa like a lot of new people I‚Äôve met like i just don‚Äôt have that spark i barely go to meetings now I‚Äôm at a fork in the road and don‚Äôt know what to do.

Question about tar.,"Hey guys been browsing through this sub reddit for a couple months but I finally got high enough and had some time alone to make an account i figured I would introduce myself.
I live on the east coast of the United States (I know there are strict rules on location so I‚Äôm leaving it at that.) I used to have a moderate heroin addiction, about $100 a day and another $40 or so in coke for speedballs. This was before the widespread fent outbreak. When I was picking up it was usually small rocks that were a tan or creamy beige color. Towards the end it got grey and I think that‚Äôs around the time the fentanyl came out because I had 3 overdose scares in a span of 5-6 months. Anyways I‚Äôve only had tar one time and compared to the rocks it suckeddd. I was getting the H through a ‚Äúplug‚Äù that generally only sold larger amounts but I had an in through a lifelong friend who‚Äôs been going to this guy for years. He never had tar himself so I am very inexperienced with it. I noticed I‚Äôve seen some people saying they‚Äôve ‚Äúsnorted‚Äù tar. Now to me that just seems silly for a couple reasons 1) everyone knows a needle is the ultimate method of delivery based solely on efficiency. 2) how in the fuck do you snort a clump of this almost hash like substance? I‚Äôm literally so confused on this.

We figured what the hell and wanted to try shooting one bundle to see what its like right before we stop.

So, the first time I shot up I did it in the vein on my right arm on the opposite side of my elbow (where blood is typically drawn at a doctor or blood drive). About 30 seconds after I started to get crazy light headed and then for about a minute I was getting this CRAZY rush that was also making me kind of light headed. Then I got really hot and really tired but after about five minutes it faded away and then I was just stable high like I snorted a fuck load of bags.

The next two times I did it exactly the same but I didnt feel anything. I know I didnt miss my vein or whatever, it stopped the onset of dope sickness but there was no rush and it just felt like typically snorting 2-3 bags.


SO, here is my question. I have these ""Sleeping Giant"" bags from New England. They are very good bags in size and quality. I wanted to try it one more time and I wanted to guarintee I got this much sought after rush people shoot up for. Here's what I did:

I took a brand new bottle of water, opened it and set the cap upside down. I dumped out THREE bags (which I thought was going to RAIL me). I filled the needle to the 40 marker with the cold water from the bottle and sprayed it onto the powdered dope in the cap. I took the plunger and worked it until it was all dissolved. This time I decided NOT to use a little piece of cotton ball and just sucked up the dope juice straight from the cap. There was no cooking of it, in fact I havent done that any time because from what I've read its just so people can feel like they are killing bacteria and it has no benefit or necessity to shoot up. Instead of my arm I put it into a fat bulging vein on my hand.

After it went into my skin I pulled up a bit to create the suction and saw the blood shoot right into the needle and then pushed it all in. So I took of my belt on my forearm, lit a butt, and sat here waiting for it to kick in. Here's the problem.... AGAIN I got no rush what so ever. After like five minutes here I feel like nodding a bit, my vision is kinda blurry and I'm definately high.... its just like a typical snorting 3-5 bag high. No matter if I did one bag or this time three, I just havent gotten that rush like I did the first time.


Can someone with experience here tell me whats up? Did I get that weird rush experience the first time just because I've never shot up before? Do you not always get a rush? Is the high supposed to be no different then just snorting dope or eating a handful of oxy? On average my girlfriend and I on a bad day split one bundle a day and when we are flushed with cashola have been known to do a half pack between us so like I said I definately have a tollerence. I just want to know if something went wrong or if I'm just an idiot and expecting something that isnt there...

Either way, she goes in tomorrow to actually take the subs for the first time so shes asleep waiting to get sick. I have my bundle for tomorrow when I do my first visit and Friday I'll be going in sick to take my first dose of subs. I don't have any more needles and will just be snorting to get by for the day but by this time tomorrow I'll be hours into starting the sickness. I'm, let's hope, never going to do dope again let alone shooting it so any ""tips"" will be just for my piece of mind trying to understand how this experience went. Please let me know what you can, I'll keep refreshing until I nod out here.",1513234659.0

This guy is either outta his fucking mind ( yes indeed I am ) or he is trolling ( which I'm not ).  I have been using heroin on and off for 5 years. I've withdrawn from 1-2 gram a day habits of tar, ecp, and fentanyl at least a dozen times and smaller habits or short runs at least another hundred. I've also withdrawn off 2mg of Suboxone cold turkey after being on it for 6 months ( I was still using heroin as well ). I've been in the game awhile and trust me, I know what TRUE pain from withdrawal feels like. I once detoxed in my car, in the dead of winter, after a gram a day ecp/fentanyl and it was the second worse week of my life. But in all my years of cold turkey heroin withdrawal, I have NEVER felt as worse as I have felt the past week coming off of gabapentin.

.         . I cold turkeyed off gabapentin 9 days ago after using 90, 300mg pills in under 13 days. The dosages weren't very consistent but that breaks out to 2,700 mg a day over the course of this binge. I was using the Gabapentin following a 3 month heroin bender, followed by 4 days of Suboxone, and 5 days of Kratom. So I thought hey, I'll just take Gabapentin and clonodine at the end of this fucked up detox plan of mine, stop the GaBa and clonodine, and I'll be cool. Well, it didn't really work out like. I also took about 1-2 mg of Xanax the final 4 days of using the Gabapentin. So maybe that had a lot to do with how horrible my withdrawal symptoms are. 

.       .So 9 days ago I stopped the GaBa and 4 days of Xanax cold turkey. I know it's not advised to abruptly stop taking both of these drugs but I really didn't have much of a choice. I blew threw my gaba script so fast my doctor wouldnt prescribe me anymore and my sister was all out of Xanax. I will never forget that Tuesday morning for as long as I live. 

.      .My symptoms include...
.       Skin crawling, nerve pain, intense burning throughout my entire body, brain zaps, an electrical forcefield that keeps shocking my whole body, Hot flashes/chills, migraine, diarrhea, nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, vertigo, ringing in ears, fatigue, insomnia, anxiety, heart palpitations, restlessness, speech and hearing impairment, and other symptoms I'm probably forgetting. 

.        . It has been 9 long and excruciatingly painful days and all the symptoms are still here!!! I have read countless of forums where people have been withdrawaling from this shit for a few months to a year and some people's symptoms NEVER go away. I really fucked up big this time , I feel like I really fried my brain with this one. Maybe it was a bad interaction with Xanax that made this so bad for me who knows. But I can honestly say the electrical forcefield which is running through my body is the most unpleasant sensation I have ever felt. Like it feels like I am on a bed of nails when laying, and I have a 3rd degree sunburn when I'm standing or sitting. I have never felt the constant sensation of nerve pain, burning, and torturous brain zaps before and it's making me long for the days of coming off heroin. I'll probably have to endure it for at least another month or two it looks like . Thats why I think this shit is worse than heroin, it's not exactly the severity of the symptoms it's the duration. Like 9 days later and I feel like I am getting worse and worse everyday.  I hope this shit clears up soon cause I swear to God I'm gonna put a fucking bullet in my head before New Year's.

Please read.,"So I've been doing this white powder im assuming was fent, Did a lot of it over the course of 2-3 weeks. I only snort or smoke. Dope boy ran out of it, So I was just gonna try to kick using suboxone. I did my last line of white shit around 5 AM Saturday night and woke up around 5 pm on Sunday. I didn't feel too bad but I assumed I had been doing fent so I thought I'd definitely be good to dose the sub. At 5:17 PM Sunday I probably had no more than one milligram of sub, And by 5:20 I was feeling the sweat coming from my pores on my face and back while on the toilet shitting my brains out. I think this happened not because I dosed too soon, But the white shit had skyrocketed my tolerance to a level subs couldn't deal with so it sent it crashing down.


Around two hours later I tried to dose more sub to help but it did the opposite. I was in awful pain for around 6 hours until I just went and copped regular dope and got very minimal relief. For the next 48 hours I might have gotten four hours of sleep, took dozens of hot baths to stop my legs from aching. No amount of dope gave me any relief besides maybe 30 minutes of restful legs or a tingling sensation in my head & back, Not high whatsoever.


It's now been 75 hours since I dosed the sub, And the dope boy has the batch back in. Everybody else can get high and got high when it was just regular dope, But all I'll get is a tingling sensation and my legs will relax a bit. What is happening to me? Did I fuck up my brain or body to where I can't get high anymore? Has anyone else dealt with something similar? Any experiences or possible explanation would be greatly appreciated.

He Most Likely Didn't Have 6 opiates in his System,"I am working on dispelling the people who claim Lil Peep had a huge drug habit and that he had 6 opiates in his system. I believe they are misanalyzing the toxicology report. Please correct me if I am wrong:

It is my mission to dispell the notion that he had 6 opiates in his system, because he didnt, he had two opiates and a ""non narcotic"" opioid that is weaker than codeine.

The metabolites Hydrocodone and Hydromorphine came from taking Norco aka Hydrocodone. When you take Hydrocodone it shows up in your urine as Hydrocodone and Hydromorphone. The same goes for the Oxycodone and Oxymorphone. When you take Oxycodone (roxi's/Blues/30's, Percocet) the metabolites Oxycodone and Oxymorphone show up in your urine.

So in reality, he only took Hydrocodone, Oxycodone and Tramadol. Since they were in his urine and not his blood, they could of been taken the 24 or more hours before because it doesn't leave your blood for 24 hours and stays in your urine for 3 days. So he could of taken them up to 3 days before but definitely not in the 24 hours before he died.

The only ACTIVE drugs he had in his system that he had taken the day of his death was Xanax, Weed, Cocaine and the fake Oxy that had the fentanyl in it. The weed and Cocaine aren't a big deal but the Xanax and Fentanyl are what killed him. If the roxi's had been legit he would still be alive.

The fact that he said he only took 60mg of roxi and THOUGHT that was how much he took, leads me to believe he didn't have a huge habit.

Some background info: My SO and I have been together for 3+ years. He has a long history of opioid addiction (heroin + an extensive list of prescriptions) due to his chronic pain. He's been weaning off of methadone for the past few years, currently on 10mg down from 200, which I'm so proud of him for. 

He's a great person and all other aspects of our relationship are healthy. However, our sex life has been pretty much non existent because of the constant mild-moderate withdrawal (understandably). We have sex maybe once every few months which is shitty for me. I'm really hoping that things become more normal after he quits but I'm worried that will be another long while since methadone withdrawal is soooo fucking long.

People went mad when Lil' Peep died. Weird.
So, these people have to go through such a hassle to get CODEINE. Fuck. Codeine. 300mg, when I had no tolerance, would make me nothing but itchy. Made me mad, that's what it did. So I found a way into opiates by searching online for sources and ta-dah, I found out that we have OTC Morphine. It's like Laudanum, and it costs approximately 5 dollars for 15mg. Totally IV'able when managed correctly.
Some time ago I ended up becoming a dope feen (totally expected, as I had problems with coke in the past) in a big city, so it was no problem getting a fix unless I was out of money. So I went out of money. Had to go back to a small city where I used to live as a teenager and, as my parents found out, they forced me to go to rehab, where I spent six months along with 90 male crack smokers and coke addicts. No one knew morphine or heroin (which I love btw).
I went out and I thought I would control it. Bullshit. Two months later, here I am again: everyday user, but at least got my tolly down. I can nod off at 45mg doses + 2mg kpin, and I've got a good amount of money to spend but ALL THE PHARMACIES ARE OUT OF STOCK. And they probably won't have it for some time. Fuck.
I went into every single pharmacy asking for it and they all told me the med would stop being sent here for no reason, and I guess the reason is me. I bought, for a straight month, 3 bottles of 15mg a day and each pharmacy has, normally, 1. People even started recognizing me and I hadn't had to ask for it, they'd just say ""the same?"" ""yes, the same"". Now...if I gave them my identity, I would get discount, and that's what I did. Think the distributor noticed it and decided to take a break so people wouldn't find out there's such a powerful OTC drug being sold as if it was aspirin.
Now I'm going through mild withdrawals and waiting for some buprenorphine I asked for 2 or 3 weeks ago, which should be arriving soon. 
Think of someone who's pissed off. That's me. Just wanted to share.

Did enough to break through the ~4mg suboxone I was on. Today no withdrawal symptoms, yet I've done none.

A week ago I would have woken up sick. And every 4-6 hours. This lull in withdrawal symptoms makes the junkie in my head think ""Hey, you've got it beat. You can just keep doing this. Maybe you'll never feel withdrawal again! You broke yourself, good job buddy, now go score that fat sack of heroin adn another one and another one and another one and another one...."" but smart me knows that's bullshit. Just in that little bit of time my physical addiction has lessened to such an extent that I don't need it every second of every day. And I'm already induced on kinda-low-dose suboxone (I REFUSE to high-dose). It'll probably be another 12-20 hours before I lose appetite, get broken sleep , runny nose and all that back. I was actually up to about 3 hours a night after those 6 days.. but last night only woke up once to smash some pepperoni cheese and crackers, smoke a cig and go back to bed.

Anyway, this is a shitpost, just trying to write it out and remind myself that though the devil may tempt me, using this lull as an invitation back into active addiction, really, it's a foreshadowing of the freedom yet to come.

If you're going through it in the beginning, keep going. If you're hating the cycle of active addiction and grinding every day for your next fix... give yourself a break. Maybe try 2 days off over a weekend, then go on for one day, then 2 days off, etc... Every single day you go through the pain you get better.

Working on your feet in the deepest throws of WD is a tour of hell.

Historically, I usually (oxy) wd on night one with no sleep but it's expected. With lope I can usually coax out a few hours sleep the next day and with in 3-4 days am doing really well.

*historically* that was. PAST tense. I guess I'm *still* being effected by the opana because I didn't sleep for 3 nights. I was ready to declare myself clean but sleep just would not come.

The first night my back hurt so back it felt broken but by the next day that was over with. Even the lethargy was starting to ebb somewhat but the mental toll that not sleeping was too much to bear and I managed to cop 45mg oxy and slept for 9 hours.

(NOT MEDICAL ADVICE),"**Short term because long-term use of high doses of loperamide have been known to cause heart problems and result in death from cardiac issues. This is not to be taken as medical advice or as anything other than a method used by the author of this post, and the safety thereof is not guaranteed.**

This is what I have done to make withdrawal tolerable in the past. Keep in mind the timing of this is very important.  

1. Take two cimetidine (Tagamet).

2. Wait one hour. Do not try to cheat this hour. You can wait longer than an hour but you must wait at least one hour. You must take tagamet one hour before every dose of loperamide. 

3. These are the instructions for a taper. Day 1-60-80mg loperamide depending on your tolerance. Day 2- 40-60mg. Day 3 40-50mg. Day 4-30-40mg. Day 5 20-30mg. Day 6-15-20. Day 7- 10-15. Day 8- 5-10mg. (Day 9 if you need it, 5mg only, or 0 if you'v been doing the lower doses.) 

4. Feel free to speed this up but don't use this any longer than suggested.

This is not medical advice and this is to be undertaken at ones own risk. Anecdotally, I haven't had any problems from doing this whenever I want to clean up for a little while, and I feel around 90% normal for most of the taper. Add some gabapentin if you still have trouble sleeping and you can come out of some pretty nasty habits without feeling like crap or going on maintenance drugs. This won't get you high at these doses but it will keep you from feeling shitty. Literally as well as figuratively. Also, while doing this, eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Just saying.

7jklaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7jklaf/slapped_a_25mcgh_fentanyl_patch_on_my_arm_about_3/,8,https://redd.it/7jklaf,Theftforcarmoney,Slapped a 25mcg/h fentanyl patch on my arm about 3 hours ago... couple questions to those experienced (1st time for me),"It's be 3 hours since I stuck it on my arm and to be honest I don't feel absolutely anything. 

When does it ""kick in""?
When does it peak?
Should I go to sleep with it on tonight? (It's 12 noon where I live right now)

I have a feeling I'm underestimating it and it's going to kick my ass in the next several hours. 

I'm opioid tolerant so I don't think I'll die. But just to say, my tolerance isn't the highest. I take roughly 40mg of oxycodone daily for months now. Should I be weary of the potency of this patch?

I put it on my bicep where a thick vein is visible, I thought that to be the most optimal place to put it.

Not much info online about the questions I have. I did about 30 minutes of research and came up with hardly anything.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all and please be safe",1513184385.0

The prescription date says November 25th 2014. Will this still be potent?

Last night I dreamt about going back in time to beat the shit out of this kid and steal his huge stash of percs and pandas that were in those lil round cases like some birth control pills are. In the dream it was totally reasonable to go back in time to do so, cuz in the present the pills were all expired and I really cared about that for some reason.




They‚Äôre the kind of dreams that make it really hard not to replapse in real life cuz you feel like you just did in your dream. Yknow? I‚Äôm just venting. I‚Äôm gonna start watching scary movies or something before bed so I can have regular nightmares like a normal person
