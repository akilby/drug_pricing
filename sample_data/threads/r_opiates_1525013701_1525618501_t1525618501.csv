I’ll try and make this as brief as I can. About a year ago I discovered that my wife had been using heroin and fentanyl for about a year. I knew something was going on but I was in denial and told myself she was just really stoned (she smokes a lot) until one night she got really sick and a friend simply said “that ain’t weed”. She finally admitted that she had been using almost daily for about a year. She said the only method she had been using was snorting powder. She said she was ready to stop and I said I would be supportive and do whatever I could to help. Anyway, that was nearly a year ago, but a few months ago I started seeing the old signs again. Nodding off, getting sick randomly, sinuses constantly fucked up, deleting texts, etc. I confronted her many times and she swore she wasn’t using again. So this week we were on vacation and she suddenly starts complaining about abdominal pains, we go to the ER, they blame endometriosis and shoot her up with morphine. I go with a nurse to fill out her paperwork, open her wallet to get her ID, empty baggies and a straw fall out. So here we are the next day. She’s admitted that she’s been using again for the past 3 months and that she ran out on our trip and was dope sick. I have literally no idea what to do. I feel like I’m killing her by supporting her. We flat out can’t afford to send her to a facility. We can’t even afford health insurance so that ER visit is already going to set me back several thousand that I don’t have. She says she wants to get clean. The ER gave her pills that she’s rationed out until we get home so she doesn’t get sick. Is kicking her out the best thing for her? If not, what’s the right way to help her? Her mom is an addict as well, and her dad doesn’t know about any of this. No one knows except for me and a couple of close friends. Should I tell her father? Or does that make things worse? Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",1525617442.0

I know I might be downvoted because of this post. Anyway I just feel to share my story.

Some days ago I order 0,5g #3 Turkish H. Came on Friday and tried it at night:

->Put 30mg on the foil, chased it the best as I could, a good big one hit. I can say I did a good job but at the end I burned it because of lack of practiqse. It didnt taste good at all but I believe It must be an adquired taste. It smells 100% like opium, and taste pretty much the same...

Well..., let me tell you I got a bit disapoint. Felt no rush at all and you could see me like waiting for it... but nothing :(. Bad quality I believe? I just felt relaxed and very dizzy. Didnt throw up, wait 20 mnts and took another hit. Didn´t feel the ""best feeling I could ever feel"", just relaxed. I felt way stronger high with good weed. After some hours went to sleep.

Now... let me tell you, and I am very very surprised by that, the next day I woke up, and after doing my daily routine, went home and tried again. To make it short:

-> Hit - no rush - dizzy - throwed up (was easy as fuck haha) and expected to feel the real high and relief after that but nope... - went bed because can´t handle the dizzy feel reason I dont like alcohol neither... a was there waiting for the feeling (no sure how to describe it) to go away.

After a while I stand up and threw the H down the Toilette. I have the doubt about H being such strong that a person who didnt ever did opiates cant even enjoy it..., or quality was just very bad.. even reviews are pretty positive...

I dont know and dont want to know. I threw the rest away and dont want to know anything anymore about opiates. I did fantasy a lot about how the feeling could be, I even crave it at times how stupid it sounds... Anyway I might get downvoted but thats fine, smoking Heroine is a very stupid decision to say less, but happy to know I just dont like it and I wont ever try to like it if I have to feel the same again.

What are your stories?,"Someone posted earlier asking about the strange feeling he is having in his legs and what that feeling might be and is it happenings because their last dose was 12 hours ago. Unreal to think a regular user could have gone so long without going through any WDs. I posted the following in the comments of that post but wanted to make my first post in this sub. I’m using my second account I exclusively created to lurk dope subreddits and try to find new connects which I am proud to say I successfully did. 

So here is my memory of my first time experiencing withdrawal, specifically the horrors that is restless leg syndrome. 

I remember my first time experiencing RLS from withdrawal and it is a big inside joke now in my relationship. I had RLS as a kid but it was mild and I could eventually fall asleep. That shit is nothing compared to the opiate WD induced variety. 

The first time I had this was the first time I was going to go more than 24 hours after starting to use and consistently using every day for at least two months. I was on a family trip with my boyfriend’s (who miraculously I am still with today) parents and other family friends. We stayed in a little bed and breakfast in NH and I was up all night in extreme agony trying to find any way to stop the feeling in my legs. I stretched them, my bf massaged them and helped me to move them in like a bicycle motion while I was on my back. I shook them continuously, rocked back and forth because moving the rest of my body sometimes helped for a second, walked around the tiny hotel room over and over probably making a shit ton of noise and a million other things but NOTHING helped for more than the shortest amount of time and in the smallest incriminates. The restlessness always came right back. After not sleeping for even one second that night, I had to go on a legit hike up a mountain and then went for a ride as a cramped-in passenger on a glider plane with my future mother in law. Look up a glider airplane and see how small these bad boys are and just the fact I was up in a plane with no engine with the pilot doing loops and shit to try to impress me while withdrawing would have been bad enough without the RLS. I also obviously had to pretend I was having the time of my life since this was a big deal for his parents to take his friends up in the plane. It was absolute torture but I think I pulled it off without being an obvious mess. Fake it til you make it was still relatively possible at this point. 

When we finally left we had to take a 2 hour car ride to the commuter rail station in MA and then an hour train back to our final destination. I didn’t get my fix until 9pm that Sunday and this all started Saturday afternoon. 

This symptom of WDs is the hands down worst one in my opinion. I would rather puke and shit at the same time (a symptom I am lucky enough not to get- no stomach issues except the sweet release of all the stuff that hasn’t come out in days/weeks) then lay in bed like I do for either an hour or ten minutes or thirty seconds then have to get up to walk around because I can’t stand being still without any relief anymore only to need to get back in the bed because walking around is the hardest most tiresome thing you’ve ever done. The feeling of being hot and cold at the same time and needed to be fully clothed and under the covers while also wanted to rip all my clothes off and throw the blankets of the bed does not help the situation at all but at least I feel like I can handle that part of it. 

Repeated this insane up and down, still then moving, shivering then sweating process all damn night or until whenever I could get my next fix.  RLS and the anxiety of knowing it would eventually start became such a regular part of my life that honestly it was one of the main reasons i kept using. I did all in my power to stop my damn legs from feeling like they want to vibrate and do an Irish jig until my calf muscles burnt out. Those muscles would hurt the next day even after I got right because they were on the move all damn night. 

RLS also ended up being the tell tale sign that I had crossed over from the “hey maybe this time the WDs won’t be that bad” into “holy fuck how can I get a bag as fast as fucking possible.” I’ve read on here people saying the yawning and watery eyes are when they know they are starting to get bad. Those symptoms meant to me that I had about 3-4 hours to fix the situation or I would be in agony all night. 

What makes it even worse is that whole first night I went through my first WDs, my boyfriend who I used with then and still am with both through long periods of being clean and dumb relapses such as the one we are in now, was comfortably dead asleep right next to me. That lucky asshole can just sleep through most of his symptoms. Then he wakes up at like 7 asking if I slept well and let’s me know he doesn’t feel good and can we see who is around. If he only knew! But he gets seriously gnarly stomach issues and I just never really have so I can feel good about not having diarrhea or puking I guess. Id trade my RLS for his shitting problems any day. No question. 

So anyone else have an interesting story about popping their WD cherry? 

This was all about 5 or so years ago btw 

tl;dr - my first time experiencing WD was on a mini trip with my BFs parents, had intense RLS, didn’t sleep a wink, hiked a mountain and flew in a glider. Spent  30+ hours like this until my next shot. 0/10 would not recommend. ",1525601726.0

When I was in Florida, it was during the pill mill years, where I was prescribed literally every opiate except Opana. I have been in and out of rehab because of this shit over thirteen times and have overdosed about twenty times, most of which were flatline OD's. I haven't seen a pain management doctor since 2013, when I was being prescribed 240 8mg dilaudid pills, 180 100mg MS Contin pills, and 180 2mg Klonopin pills. From 2013-until early 2018, the only thing I took was kratom. About a kilo a month. I stayed clean for the most part, even though in 2016, I had some relapses on IV heroin, and would stay clean (kratom only) for about three months, and then relapse on dope. This went on until about a month ago when I had a major relapse on heroin because I discovered the main dope blocks near my new house, and almost lost my wife. When I ran out of money, and almost lost my job, I decided to get back on Suboxone. I quit the kratom after about five years of daily use (and my gastrointestinal system thanks me for it) and try my best not to use dope more than once or twice a month. Fast forward  to present time, now I'm living in a major city in the North East, and the main opiate options are heroin, fentanyl posing as heroin, and more heroin. I like having a job with insurance, a family that talks to me and a wife at home that is mostly happy with me, so I try to stick with my suboxone regiment. However, the suboxone doesn't do shit for my chronic pain. I have a Primary care doc who writes me the suboxone script but that is all he will write for. What I'm wondering, is if any of you have been in a similar spot where after years of use, you ended up back on suboxone but aren't getting the pain relief you need? I am considering trying to see a pain management doc, and if this was ten years ago, I wouldn't think twice about keeping quiet about the suboxone dr and then getting pain pill scripts from the pain management dr, but I'm pretty sure that insurance companies and pharmacies are all linked together with the new system that would make it nearly impossible to doctor shop. Do you think I could talk my doctor into switching me to Subutex, so I could ask for a referral to pain management and then ask them to keep the subutex for daily use and then get something for breakthrough pain? Is this even a possibility? I know this sort of regiment is possible on methadone, but I will never go back on methadone. I love how suboxone allows me to not be dopesick and function at work, but I'm still in pretty severe pain daily. I'm at a 6/10 from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, and it jumps to 8/10 after a rough day at work or just from overuse of my leg/ankle from walking too much. I really could use any advice that any of you might have because as much as I love being clean and sober for the most part and just using suboxone every day, I can't stand the actual physical pain.

I've had a box of 100 insulin syringes and a box of the standard run lf the mill syringes under my sink for years. All I've managed to muster up the courage to do was pop an insulin spike into my stomach for a PCT supplement. I don't mind other people doing it to me (my wife used to stick me several times a week with Test E and sust) I just always get to the point of tying off, puncturing the top layer of skin, and flaking. I just don't know exactly how far to go. I started boofing fent 3 days ago, I'm fuckin slammed right now and I believe I've psyched myself out enough to do it tomorrow. If I take that long dirt nap I don't really mind. I just hope I don't wake up if that's the case :p Im sure a few of you guys have read my replies on that fellas post who od'd on Thursday so you understand where I'm coming from with that last comment.

I was at 4mg then broke my arm. My doctor upped my dose to 24mg in the hopes it would allow me to manage pain with out full blown agonists. Well something clicked and I pretty much got maliciously addicted to the suboxone and started taking six or more 8mg tabs a day. Needless to say my 28 day prescriptions where running out pretty early and I would frantically throw large sums of money in order to encourage anyone I could to sell me some of there precious supply.

It worked for a few months, well worked in a fucked up way for me. Finally I went through the script in two weeks and no one was around to spare anything. I didn’t tell my doctor or counselor, I still haven’t. 

I needed to get through. I have a job, I’m the bread winner for the family, I wasn’t (and still am not) thinking rationally. I had no connections. I magically managed to arrange an internet cold cop. I reached out through the most suspicious ways and some shining soul answered me. 

Very nervously I met up with this person. I had taken my last 6mg of suboxone that morning. I gave him my money and he gave me his dog. After a little wait he came back and gave me my item: snow white shiny powder, most likely fentanyl. 

I brought it home and did a small test bump. Then another, then another. Due to the bupeprenorphine still in my receptors I didn’t feel high, but I did feel relieved. Through the next couple days I continued to do it while the subs left my system. By day 3 is way undeniable, I was getting high from a full agonist opiate.

Does it sure feel good. Mostly the quality has been good and I have been in bliss. I know this can’t last, I know I need to stop. I managed to get some suboxone, I am just in such a honeymoon period. 

Now the shitty positive. While on such a high dose of suboxone I for the life of me was not having good regular bowel movements. Now early in the morning I get to wake up, have that wonderfully euphoric first fix and then take a nice large easy BM.

I’m at the point where it doesn’t really provide me much (if any) euphoria like it did at one point.

I feel like stimulants now remind me of the reason I fell in love with opiates. The euphoria and enjoyment of daily activities and hobbies. While I only take them now a few times a month; I find that I feel so great and motivated on them.

While on dope everyday, I don’t feel the need to do anything beyond what’s required of me. Which sucks. I have a lot of hobbies and interests that I love and I’ve just stopped partaking in these things unless I need to.

For example; I’ve been playing guitar for 14 years and it’s my absolute favorite thing to do. When I first starting taking opiates, it made me want to always play and practice when high. And it was so fun.

Now, I rarely play / practice on my own. I’m in a band that practices several times a week; so I’ll play then. And also I teach lessons which ‘forces’ me to play.

It sucks. Having your favorite things to do lose interest. I have no drive or motivation to do anything. I rarely read anymore either like I used to love to do all the time.

Tables turned real quick...
Can anyone else relate? It’s crazy because taking something like IR addies or doing lines of cocaine will instantly make me want to start being the person I used to be. I’ll start playing and writing songs again.

Fuckin’ sucks.

8h9m71,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8h9m71/prison_heroin/,25,https://redd.it/8h9m71,InfiniteBrendan,Prison Heroin,"WARNING: Very long

For those of you who are unaware, Suboxone is a HUGE drug in jail/prison. 

I can only speak for Massachusetts (though, I'd hazard to guess it has reached all corners of the continent by now, what with the opioid epidemic spanning just as wide) when I tell you it's so widely used/abused-- crossing all racial, class, and criminal boundaries-- that on a given day, if you were to drug test the entire state prison population in MA, close to 70% of inmates would come back positive for bupe. This is not hyperbole, or exaggeration to stress the point; it is hard-earned knowledge from nearly a decade's experience. 

While the county jails have not been so greatly affected by this epidemic, upstate, where there are contact visits at 95% of the prisons, it is entirely possible to go years without ever running into trouble w/r/t procuring it-- should your financial means allow it, that is. 

Since 2011, when Reckitt Benckiser's patent for buprenorphine/naloxone pills expired, and the advent of film, the price inside, for Suboxone, has gone down considerably-- thanks entirely to the ease with which it can be smuggled into a facility via the visiting room. Previously, the more voluminous tablets, ever proving a burden and risk with respect to smuggling, would routinely yield a 2000% profit on their $10 street value; while the film, however, eventually settled at a much more reasonable $50. Once the Suboxone are introduced to the facility (usually 250-400 film per visit) and distributed to the plethora of dealers trying to cash in on a highly lucrative economy,  you can purchase Suboxone across a wide range of quantities, at a variety of prices. 

While buying ""singles"" for $50 each is quite common, it is far from your only option. You can buy in bulk and save money (5 for $200; 10 for $350; 40 for $1,000; 100 for $2,000; and even 1,000 for $17,500). Additionally, for the more industrious and business-savy addict, he can buy in bulk and turn a profit by selling part of his stash in what are known as ""pieces"" (2mg-- aka a quarter or a quaker-- for $20; 1mg-- aka an eighth-- for  $15, 0.5mg-- aka a sixteenth or a teena-- for $8; and, for desperate times, 0.25mg-- aka a thiry-second or tray-duece-- for $5). All in all, it's a distressing economy-- the whole thing. It costs so much money to maintain a habit -- more than likely your family are sending the dough via Western Union or the like to some female gang member who's willing to walk into prison with her lady-safe packed to the gills with a balloon of Subs-- that it just makes no sense. It's Suboxone! 

That honeymoon phase can't be stretched to cover 5, 10, 20 years. But boy, do we try! We try the seemingly more bioavailability- advantageous routes of administration (are there even?); we play close, acute attention to its effects and try to reason that we are high-- when, in fact, we are just not sick; we tell ourselves, It might be costing Grandma $250 a week, but God dammit, at least I'm jammed. It's horrible. 

Suboxone has a great role in recovery from opioid addiction-- in fact, I take it presently; however, when abused to the extent it is in prison, it has an adverse effect. Addicts who should be clean by virtue of incarceration, are now leaving prison opioid-addicted (if only partially)-- and having sought their drug, and handled their drug, and consumed their drug, with addict behaviors, ostensibly they are going to seek to meet those needs with an actual drug upon hitting the streets. 

While I managed to kick my 8mg a day habit prior to my release in 2017, I had never afforded myself the opportunity to divorce those addict behaviors and actually work on myself and my recovery. Within 28 days of my release (I took the Vivirtol injection 3 days prior to going home-- having had been 3 weeks Suboxone-free-- and assumed that would be my cure) I relapsed. It's been close to a year since I was released-- June 30th, 2017-- and I am three months clean. I take 8mg per day, and I work a recovery program. I don't credit Suboxone for my 90 days in recovery, but I am grateful to have it as a crutch. 

TL;DR: Massachusetts, along with most states, has terrible Suboxone epidemic in it's state prisons. I spent 8 years consumed by the drug in there. I left no better than when I went. Clean now.

Just wanted to let you guys know that I know exactly what it's like to not want to get clean, to see no point in life and feeling like if I can't get high life isn't worth living. It's been a long, slow process of getting to know myself again and re learn new habits. A lot of (in my opinion) assholes will say getting sober has been great and they have their life back etc but for me honestly it's been so difficult. This is the first time as an adult I have been functioning in society without drugs. It's frustrating and sometimes it feels like it's not worth it. 

Heroin was my solution, my distraction from this shitty world and hate for myself. I loved that sanctuary but looking back I didn't know what love was. Learning how to love myself again currently. Maybe after that I can learn to love life the way I see others loving it.

I feel nothing but dysphoria and like I have half a fucking soul when I'm sober. I dont want to be like this. I envy normal people. I almost gave everything important left in my life up for just one more fix.

I broke down and asked for help instead. I have issues with asking fir help and thinking I can control my life but over time I know that isnt true no matter how strongly I feel I can. The exact thinking that got me into the beat of opiates, thinking I can control what 30 million people around the world struggle with. I know with the things that I have done that if I wasnt born in the USA I would be dead or killed for the things I have done, simple as that. But I am still here, Ive contracted Hep C from sharing needles, and yet my body is fighting it off on its own. Ive Overdosed waking up from death in the ambulance several times, yet always woke up, even the worst time where I need 3 doses of IV narcan to bring me back.

Real quick, I must apologize about my writing. I know I run on sentences and topics, I just type from my mind and thats about how fast Its going atm.

Continuing on,  if there is a God, then he must have something important for me to do, and thus everyone has some kinda potential to meet, no matter the path they take in life. 

The last love of my life used to joke that I am the luckiest person she knows, I dont know how right she is, maybe im being kept alive as punishment. To endure all of this mess. Whatever the reason, if I make it out, I have plenty of writing material for a decent book maybe haha

Not to mention I started Zoloft, and my anxiety has got a lot better. I don't wake up with anxiety anymore which is fantastic. But I would like to have a script of Xanax just in case I do have a panic attack or something.

Now with that being said, If I go and refill my prescription of Xanax, or any prescription for that matter, will that show up on his computer next time I see him? Because i know this one doctor I saw before they asked me the last time
I took my prescriptions, and they logged it. Like whether I took it today, yesterday, this week, etc.

The doctor that prescribed me Xanax is not in the same network as this pain doctor.

Has anyone tried CBD oil to ease withdraw symptoms? If yes, did it help? How did it stack up against other things you have tried e.g. loperamide or Kratom (Not options that require a prescription like subs or methadone. I know you can find them if you look but not quite what I am looking for here)?

So! I occasionally get dope off of my boyfriends brother. Now while we are all junkies and do some grimey shit sometimes, this kid is like that times ten. Anyway. I give him 50$ at 3:30 to go and grab five tickets (that’s what he calls stamp bags), and says I’ll be back in about an hour. Which is completely fine because it is a while away. I also give him money for gas and an extra ten to grab himself a bag as well. 

The hour passes and I text him to see what’s up. He’s at the place getting it but apparently (and please understand that I do not condone this type of language nor do I participate in it. However, I don’t say anything to defend it), “I’ve been here since 4:30 but you know how these fucking n-words take forever.” Whatever. The worst part? It doesn’t even end up happening because he had to be a super awesome dad (/s) and get home to get his daughter for the weekend. I get that. Fine. He then informs me “I can get different tickets as soon as I get back though.” Well first off, why in the fuck didn’t you do that in the first place?! Whatever. 

So FINALLY he says meet me at so and so street, so I make my way over. And who happens to be with him?! His toddler aged fucking daughter. Who knows me as Aunty brokenhalfjap. Terrific. The best part?! Instead of five bags I end up with three. Because apparently the kid he got them from charges a bag and he spent the ten I gave him, as well as the gas money, on god knows what and needed a bag but “you know I got you tomorrow.” 

I guess my question is .. what would you do in this situation?! He is my only connect for dope and as a middle class average looking white girl, who likes to wear dresses and look as nice as makeup allows me to, its hard to find a plug that’ll actually deal with me.

Treading the skirts of eventide

But between the clasps of his hand and hers

Lay felt-not twenty withered years.

She turned with the route of her south dusk hair

And saw the sleeping gypsy their

She snatched and snapped in swift child's whim 

With keep it long as you live to him

And a smile like nymphs from their laving meres 

Trembled up from a bath of tears, 

And Joy like a mew'd sea rocked apart 

Tossed upon the wave of his troubled heart

So far none of these methods have worked... so now I am seriously considering this plan: walk into the bathroom immediately after getting Vivitrol, bust out a sterile syringe/sterile needle (same length needle that was used to give the shot), then stab myself right over the injection site and attempt to aspirate as much as possible. I'm sure it will hurt like a fucking bitch but oh well. Has ANYONE on Viv ever been desperate enough to try this before?

I always keep delaying the stopping part because I’ve been through the heroin withdrawals and don’t want to go through that ever again. If it wasn’t for the being sick part I could quit no problem. I don’t want to get sick and have my family find out I’m back on opiates. I just did a 5 year stretch for a distribution charge and I’ve been home 9months. Here I am back on pills again. However I do work a full time job that I make 25 an hour at so I’m not out there robbing and stealing to get my pills. I do however always have to borrow money because my habit cost more than I make at my job. I also do some side work where I make a few hundred here and there but I’m still in the hole. I absolutely love the high and I work so much better when I’m on. I know everyone is gonna say go to classes or rehab but that’s not an option with my current situation.

Its a brand new tamper resistant oxycodone,"I have a bunch of the 18mg xtampza er capsule. So far I tried just straight cooking them and they dont seem to be water soulable. The powdery micro beads melt down to liquid that is a goldish color but floats to the edges and doesnt mix with boiling water. I tried dry frying them too. Melting them down alone to a puddle then rapodly squirting water but after the steam and bubbles clear again they seperate. Once you melt it down and let it cool the oily liquid hardens to a white waxy material. You cant crush the beads down either. They are basically powder and grinding it turns it into a sticky wax paste. Can't snort them because they dont dissolve. I left some in a spoonful of coca cola over night and can to find flat coke with the small beads turned to wax floating on top. I read in a bluelight thread that citric acid works but tried that and again, they become a sticky wax blob. I even got desperate and microwaved the powder hoping it woukd dry out and i could pulverise it ibto something to snort. No dice there either. It melts into a puddle then catches fire before the luid gets a chance to dry. I read that too was designed in response to people microwaving OP ocycontin and OP pandas to dry then grind with hose clamps. They spent 7 years developing this shit and it really covers all bases. We need to think outside the box or soon enough all pharm opis will be garbage and heroin will be the only option unless you can get hospital vials of liquid opiates.  

Is there no way to defeat the time release on this shit? I ate 180mg of them at once letting the powder soak in my mouth a while and felt not a damn thing. These are prescribed for moderate to severe pain and to be taken 3x a day. The person who gets them is getting them for cancer. They took her off of 30mg morphine ir 3x a day, 8mg dilaudid 4x a day or as needed, and 15mg roxi for breakthrough pain. All that daily for 20 months now she gets Xtampza 18mg 6x a day and tramadol 50mg as needed. She has never been suspected of abusing her meds and this is in a state known for elderly people and opiate prescriptions. He dr told her the dea has enacted new rules and new policies are in place to phase out what they deem ""abusable narcotics"" ao that not even generics will be passed by the FDA if they dont meet the new requirements. Those being they cannot mix with water and they cannot be broken down in any form to be used in an instint fashion.


Naturally I thought the dr was bullshitting but I personally know over 40 people who get hardcore narcotics most for pain management. And juat this past month they have one after another been reduced to getting 5 days supplies of dilaudid no matter who they are. The regular month script is written out but the FDA has a policy that is being implimented to where you must return to your pharmacist every 5 days for more of your pills. No longer will they fill the entire month supply at once. The policy change isnt in full effect ywt but many of the more notable doctors are already making the change ahead of time at the urge of their lawyers. In the likely event they get charged with unethical behavior due to overprescribing they can fall back on being early adopters of the new Trump lead policy.

The marketing for these Xtampza er's claim the formula allows you to absorb more oxy than regular instant release so the 18mg pill is supposed to equal 20mg instant release. The 36mg pill is supposed to equal 40mg instant release. How the fuck can they claim that in good faith when 10 of the 18mg pills did jack shit to me? I read all pharma companies are now testing this wax formula and planning to release all prescription opiates with this new formula so that orally is the absolute only route possible.

Bleeds heavily, then dies.

I cut deeper: this is all I find;

So since this incident where I went to get the Xtampza filled. I have had to the pharmacy 3 times. My plan was to use a mom and pop. I honestly just didn’t get around to doing it. I was going to try Publix because people in the pain management waiting room were talking about pharmacy issues and everyone who didn’t have any said “Publix, Publix,Publix”. Publix is like a Kroger, Stew Leonards (gosh I miss that place so much </3) etc.

So anyway I decided to just give it a shot. I got to the Walgreens and I drop off my 120 norco 10 RX. 31 days since the last fill. I have filled this rx here at this exact location for the past year with 0 problems. Different lady take it, takes my ID (I haven’t got the address changed) tells me “give us about an hour or so sweetie”..... no problem
I have shit to do anyway. When I pick it up give them my ID different person a younger male he says “can you confirm your address?” “I said it’s the one listed in your system I ordered a new ID”  he said “ ok no worries. He reminded me that my address on my scripts is still the old one to make sure I change it in my doctors system too. 

A few days later I drop off my adderall RX, its for 45 20mg IR. I’m like a week late, which is fine again no biggie. The lady there still not the one old bitch. Again they have no problem just explain I’m waiting for my new ID and that someone that worked there changed it before I had my new ID.

Then again a few days later I drop off my Xanax RX. Its for 0.5mg 30 of them. Last time I dropped it off was in 12/2017. They last me a long time, I had 2 refills believe but again they last, I usually take 0.25 anyway. As I go to drop it off....... guess who is there? The OLD BITCH! I had my phone ready with a picture of the online website where I paid to have the address changed and proof that it’s on the way. I hand her the RX and my current ID. My heart is fucking racing. She says “ok well let’s see when the last time you got this filled was”.... I’m thinking really bitch? You can keep that to yourself but whatever. I said “ I believe it was December”. She said “yep December, Good girl” and I was like “yep, they last a long time”. When I picked them up, different lady, no problem just told her ID was ordered. 

So I realize that not only did the pharmacist probably not even say that shit that she told me he did, but basically she’s just a jaded, crotchety, old bitch. I feel much better about it. ",1525461208.0

I don’t have really any opiate tolerance, I usually do half of one of the oxy 40 yellows to get nodding or at least pretty baked.

I took 250mg of codeine + 50mg DPH and barely got euphoria, just a lot of scratching and slight sedation, also some good bud mixed in

I’ve heard codeine is only like 5x less weak than oxy so how come I wasn’t nodding out hard? Does codeine just suck or what? I mean I got 500mg for 20$ so it wasn’t a bad deal but still.

But before that, of course I loaded up the last of my gear so I could think clearly. My next thought was, ""How can I get $80 today?"" 

My paycheck doesn't come for another day, and decide to try my luck with Craigslist and a burner computer I use for DNM. I advertise it as a Dell Inspiron with Tails installed. A few hours later, I got an offer and met up with a Chinese man outside of a Starbucks conveniently close to the hood. (Starbucks in the hood, I know right?)

I call my usual man immediately after my sweaty fingers crumple up the twenty-dollar bills this man so graciously saved me with, but to no avail. His line's dead. I owe my other man most of what I have in my hand, and I don't want to deal with another spot. Another guy will be available in 30 minutes.

So I drive a little bit deeper into the scoring vicinity, and stand outside for a smoke. That's when would-be Junkie Jesus, carrying a bike frame in one arm, and a box of Newports in the other - asks me for a light. He asks if I'm from around here, to which I reply ""No, but my guy is."" He says, ""Who's your guy? I'm the guy around here."" I explain to him how I'm looking for food, and without hesitation he hops in the passenger side of my old Camry.

He has me drive around the block twice, says that it's all clear and to give him the money and he's going to run and grab some ""uncut shit"" from this house with boarded up windows and lawn chairs tossed around the front yard. I'm not keen on giving my money to strangers, so we reach an agreement where he'll keep his phone, cigarettes, and bike frame in the car while he goes to get it.

Sickness is starting.

He comes out twenty minutes later, and says ""Aight man, now we gotta head over to the lab and cut this shit. Copped 12 grams, one of those are yours."" Fuck me - just give me the uncut shit now and I'll worry about my safety later. 

So we head to the laboratory, across town to a community of equally distraught homes and lawn chairs. He runs inside for an hour, comes back out and says we're going to pick up from elsewhere. Fuck me, this is a second red flag.

Well now my dealer's calling me back, so I tell him I need my money back - no shit he spent it on his own crack, but he knows everyone around this area and that it won't be a problem.

I drive around for five hours, taxi cabbing this fifty year old man hitting some of the strongest crack I've had in my life. But I'm sick now, so we pull over to the motel where I get serious - I tell him I need shit or money now. He knocks on every door asking if anyone has food. What the fuck. I make him call his boy at the lab. He tells me, ""Ain't no traffic at the lab while they cookin' up, you crazy boy?"" I retaliate with ""Well how long, I've been waiting 6 hours?"" I'm informed they're cooking up kilos in there and it'll take a few hours.

Not so much later, we pull into a gas station so he can get an Arizona and I leave his ass. The things I'll do for a fix.

So I drop these two healthy chunks on my scale, shaking a little bit in anticipation. 2.13g. Wat. I think I forgot to breathe for a minute. I weighed them separately to make sure my scale wasn't being fucky. Nope. I got four times what I was expecting.

Well, I got a pretty bad infection that spread to my bone and I’m on some hardcore antibiotics and my doctor wrote me a script for 60 Percocet, 10mg. I’ve been in legit pain. Over a period of 8 days I pretty much took them every 3.5-4 hours, even at night. Well 2 days ago I stopped taking them cold turkey because I wanted a break, didn’t think anything of it. But my entire body feels like all the joints and muscles deeply hurt, even in my fingers. I can’t sleep well, I wake up every other hour feeling like I need to stretch my legs. I’ve also been sweating a lot. I googled it and it sounds like these could be a withdrawal symptoms. I’m still able to live my life, I’m not bedridden or anything, but I don’t like it. Although this is minor compared to what many others are going through, it’s uncomfortable. To top it off, I’m in legit pain again, Motrin isn’t helping, I called my doctor and he said to take the Percocet as directed. I won’t be taking it as often, no way. 

So my questions are, can I take a Percocet here and there for pain? Or just stop altogether and suffer - in pain and mildly withdrawing? How the hell does this work? Like I need this medication right now but I don’t want to create further issues.

Anyways, I've finally put down the fentanyl nasal spray and got myself on methadone!  It's truly the best choice I've ever made in recovery.  I have been taking it for three weeks and have been stabilized at 50mg for about ten days.

I was a fent user for over five years and have been trying to get clean for about two years.  I went to my first 30 day rehab in summer 2015.  Another about a year later.  Then my most recent about six months ago.  I though the last one was different and would DEFINITELY stick.  Less than a month after I get out I'm back at it...  over the past two years I was back and forth with Suboxone maintenance.  It worked sometimes and completely failed other ones.  After my most recent relapse it did nothing and that's when I decided to give methadone a try.

Sure it costs about $500 a month, sure I have to go to the clinic every day, and sure I'm not technically sober.  But I am a functioning member of society, I haven't crashed my new car, I've held down a awesome job for two weeks now, and I can function in social settings.  

I'm ecstatic!  So yay me! 

But on to my question.  I've been breaking out all over my body.  The pimples are small and hardly noticeable unless you get close or feel my skin.  Face, back, arms, legs, butt, etc...  Has anyone experienced this and is there anything I can do to mitigate them?  I eat quality food, I shower regularly, and I drink plenty of water. 

Opiates generally cause me to break out along with cigarettes (I've been smoking more than usual, a little more than a pack a day).  I hope to quit the ciggs in time, and reduce the amount as quick as possible, but don't plan on changing my methadone dose anytime soon.  Any ideas?

So, after five years of really, really abusing my veins with a combination of poor technique, UK heroin that requires citric acid to become injectable, cocaine & occasionally injecting straight alcohol into them, my veins are now well & truly fucked. I spend over an hour trying to hit a vein on my arms & hands, and when I do get blood the majority of the time the vein is so shallow that it slips right out again.

The veins in my feet are too shallow to hit, and I've never ever been able to hit my legs, which for some reason have no visible veins at all. The vast majority of the long-term junkies I know in person use their femoral vein, and though I really really envy the speed & ease with which they can shoot up, I also know how risky it is and don't want to join them.

Can anyone offer any suggestions for what I could do? Are there any non-visible veins that I could try to hit? Is it safer to go in the jugular vein than in the groin? I'm really desperate for some suggestions - it feels like I'm one missed hit away from just saying fuck it and grabbing some 2ml barrels and figuring out where this fucking femoral is. 

Also, I recently did 40 days with nothing but buprenorphine, so I was expecting that my veins would be somewhat better by now. Nope. The only change was 2 new veins appeared, and both of them were gone again after one use. This is infuriating.

I've been taking codeine for years now, never more than once a week. I really enjoy it, look forward to it as my weekend treat to wind down after work (I work in a creative field so it's mentally taxing). I used to get a nice buzz off 60mg but that was about 14 years ago, but now I have about 180mg of it (had 120mg of DHC last night) and get nice and drowsy, just sit reading on my phone, eating crap and enjoying life. 

The following day I usually feel a bit short-tempered and agitated but also kindof in a cloud hangover too. If no one bothers me it's a good day but if something niggles at me I get real angsty and lose my temper. 

I have no intention of upping my dose or the rate at which I take codeine but is there anything I need to be aware of? I'm not as risk of getting addicted as I'm hyper aware of my intake and careful to not do it more than once a week, and have kept this up for years. But the fact that I see it as an enjoyable part of my weekly routine, that I look forward to, is that a cause for concern? Would a weekly dose of opiates harm my mental capacity of coping skills in any way?

I do tend to overthink things and I'm wondering if I'm doing it with this, and my bad temperedness during the way is just a natural part of the ageing process. 

I guess I'm just rambling here but I'd like to hear from anyone who does small amounts of opiates in a safe schedule. Also if there are any studies done of people who use at this level and if it's been deemed harmful or harmless?",1525392091.0

OxyContin - 56 tablets @ 40mg
OxyContin - 112 tablets @ 20mg
OxyNorm (Roxycodone) - 112 Capsules @ 10mg

Lyrica (Pregabalin) - 84 Capsules @ 200mg

Diazepam - 28 tablets @ 10mg

Nitrazepam - 28 tablets @ 5mg

So, all of these cost me £52.80

I wanted to compare the prices to the US so I went on GoodRx

The Oxy came in around 150USD each dosage form

The Lyrica came in at around 600USD
The Diazepam @ 7USD
Nitrazepam not available.

Am I missing something here? 

In the US, over 1000USD
In the UK, £52.80

Is that 1000USD figure without insurance? 
How does it work. Confused 😗

This was around a year back and I stopped and turned to codeine etc. just tonight, I got my hands on some of them old pal trams and two hours in, I find myself with a killer headache.

the side effects of tramadol overweighs it's potential for high and I was once young and stupid for making it my go to in the past. I'm not proud of my decision to ""experience trams again"" and I'm just reminded of all the reasons why I stopped using it.

Truth is im getting older and my body isn't recouping like it used to and let's be honest I just love the guy. But this time in the hospital i was treated like the biggest junkie ever. I usually have a pretty thick skin but these doctors were awful, not all but most. Now mind you I was in the whole week and a half  and the whole time I was on a dilaudid drip no questions asked everyone was great. Fast forward to discharge and the nurse says there is so trying wrong that the hospital wouldn't just have me jump from my if pain meds to no pain meds at all. I wait around a few extra hours and nope the pain Dr at the hospital doesn't feel comfortable giving a drug addict pain medicine, this is the same guy that had me on the pain pump the whole time. I told him I never ask for anything and he said well this was a painful surgery and aftercare and I want nothing. I'm buddy one minute u don't wanna give a junkie anything but the next I'm supposed to get for you to say no uh get fucked. I'm so over it. Anyway I'm alive and guess what I'm have an appointment with MY pain Dr so we will see. If I lose my script i lose it. I never said anything to the hospital about pain management  but I opted not to.

I remmeber mufirst ever time using it, no idea what i was doing, i started at 2mg and throughout the day ended up doing 14mg

Now obviously i was completely feeling normal again with no hot flashes or stomach cramps, but i then scored the next day and couldn’t get high until about 100 hours later, and it sucked, 14mg is overkill for anyone no matter how much you use.

Since then i’ve realised that 1-2mg is too small, and that 4-6mg is perfect and i’m a heavy user.

**Do you get better results from doing 6mg in one go? Or 1mg every hour?**

id like to test out all in one go, but i’m sure you’re all the same, even when we’ve waited long enough, we are scared of Precipitated withdrawals, which happened last night after waiting only 3 hours after heroin ran out, so i always start off at .5-1mg just in case it happens, because 6mg too soon would be hell on earth.

Well today I get home from work and there’s a package in my mail from the place I started to order from and lo and behold a bottle of CLam!! They totally had to have sent this as a mistake because I checked my accounts and there’s no purchase history to the vendor so I definitely 100% did not pay for this.

That first month was amazing. Take a few teaspoons before work and it feels like a percoset to me \(no opiate experience or tolerance otherwise\). At first it was really great for uncomfortable social situations because I felt so good on it I didn't really care what other people thought about me. But now obviously my tolerance has gone up. All kratom does for me now is give me a little mood boost/body euphoria for maybe an hour or two after taking it but nothing substantial like before.

I am a former benzo addict and thus I really seek out anything that makes me feel more comfortable in social situations. I think I know the answer but I was wondering if there's anything a bit stronger than kratom that isn't dangerous? I really like the safety profile of kratom but it just doesn't work like it used to and if I'm being honest with myself I know I can't just take kratom 2\-3 times per week because I lack the self control. Does anyone have experience with kratom extracts? I was thinking possibly I could take my normal doses of kratom during the week but take an extract if I'm doing something social. This to me seems like the progressiveness of addiction and I really don't want to be addicted to anything harder. At least kratom is safe and doesn't affect my life that much. Sorry this post is so messy. Any feedback would greatly appreciated.

Now ofcourse i was doing dope till the day before my sentencing so ofcourse i eitger go through wd or do dope. My friend told me about the certo method wich has worked so far. So i was able to pass my tests except for the first one wich i popped for coke when i did crack 2 days before. However i did dope and crack at the same time so i guess it worked for opis but not crack. So ive managed to stock up on kratom and some lyrica and i think im in the clear for wds. If thats the case then im not going to dope again until probo is over...im hoping if i piss clean, pay my fines quick, and get ny community service ill be able to have it sortened.

I take stool softeners which work great, but I have a problem of forgetting to take them after I have gone to the restroom. Last week, I paid for this. I went three days in a row, each less painful than the last but still unpleasant. 

I did some research and saw a video about Dulcolax (My brand! I have a special anus) suppositories. I thought what the heck, I'll try it. Yesterday (my birthday) I didn't feel the need to go at all. So last night, I used it, and eliminated a small amount. 

Then, this morning my friend wakes me up at 5 am to smoke crystal. After our session, I rushed home. And I'm happy to say I had the most comfortable experience in the bathroom in literally years. 

My schedule has been really bad, and unhealthy. I would go once a week, sometimes longer, and you're supposed to go twice per DAY. So I've gone almost 1x a day the past week, and I feel much better. No more cramps, or dreading that feeling of having to go, or clogged toilets. 

Take care of your colons, men. (And ladies, and others). 

Edit; I wanted to add why waiting to go is such a problem. The job of your colon is to draw water out of stool so you don't become dehydrated. The longer you wait to go, either because of drugs, diet or others, the dryer and harder it becomes. (This is where softeners come in) Not to mention both getting longer and increasing in diameter (IMO this is the worst part). So you really want to keep your colon clear often as possible. Avoiding going because of the pain increases the problem, and it creates a  cycle. ",1525351574.0

Sorry for typos or parts that don't make sense, I'm on some 7/10 #4, etizolam, and good ole dab pen.

So he and haven't been friends too long, maybe like 8 months, but we've had a couple heated conflicts. We'd reconcile cuz we have a lot of potential of being great friends. Also we both use herroin I just take maybe 20-40mg plugged will get me good. This guy tho, I've seen him shoot half a gram of some obsidian black and just nod out. And I can vouch, I've tried all types of heroin, multiple times and this black was extremely potent.

Anyways, he had owed me $80 for a month, and while I need cash, he used all his money to a q of tar, but its some of the beautiful tar I've ever seen. So what we decided to do is: I get my debt in 0.8g of black and since he needs to reup, he convinces me to take this offer - top off the black, 120mg of blues, few kpins, 20mg norco for $120, which I can spare but it is above my drug budget so I don't want to, but that's a pretty good deal, can't pass it up. Besides, with that I could last at least 40 days it if I stretch it. 

**tl;dr - 1 gram of 9/10 black, 120mg oxy couple kpins , 20mg norco for 200, 120 of which was out side my drug budget. Also help with dosing the pharmas.**

The #4 and tar I *usually* get would both get a 7/10. 

What is the most effective way I can use those 4 30mg blues and 2 10/315 hydrocodones? Since my tolerance is too high for these alone. I would rather plug the hydros and oxys I'm thinking snort half one with the hydro plug, eat half. Maybe plug tar, snort oxy.

I have other stuff too but i know how to mix those with these so no problemo.

just flushed my last 0.2g of raw, getting an outreach team to take all my equipment tonight and gonna sweat it out at home. friend has sworn he isnt selling me anymore (he doesnt need me as a customer and haa been a friend longer than a dealer) and im gonma sweat it out. no point in opioid substitution this early in the game. just withdraw and remove contacts.

Being able to go up with stimulants, come down with alcohol and benzos, constantly be in a haze of highs, and etc has made me really miss drugs for the escapism it offered. I also wonder if my brain and my mind has permanently changed. I used heroin once to many times everyday for a month 2 years ago and without a doubt, it was one of the most euphoric substances possible. The only reason I didn't get it again was cause I didn't know how to or at least I wasn't desperate enough to seek it on the street which I felt could be much more risky than casually buying weed or other college friendly drugs from other students. Last month, I was extremely depressed and I went to a sketchy ass part of a city but was too scared to cold cop and ask random people on the street for dope. Its insane how much my standards have changed. I have done things I would have never imagined I would have done. It is opening a hole you can't come back from. How am I supposed to ""forget"" these highs? I was hospitalized this last week after suffering acute kidney injury from 3 meo pcp and still I am willing to do drugs? I tell myself that because I am not physically withdrawing from drugs or physically reliant that I am ""okay"" which is wrong. When I would trip on psychedelics, I would always end up having anxiety and bad trips because my mind would fucking tell me to fucking quit drugs. My sober mind doesn't feel that same intense feeling of disgust. That way, I always found psychedelics nice in the sense of being the most anti-drug drug. I am graduating college in a week with a degree but I feel still worthless and that it is justified to feel that way. I literally spent most of my time high and I wasted so much time. Time I could've spent meeting more people, being more social, going to clubs, learning more about my goals and hobbies. Am I literally just so fucking weak minded that despite the re occurring negative consequences that I can't quit? I don't want to quit but in theory should. The justifications keep pulling me back. 

Ultimately, what I'm trying to say is that because I have trained my brain and my mind to be in this lifestyle of drugs for the last 4 years, will I always want to fill the void? In spite of the idea of treating my depression through therapy / whatever else and the idea of improving my life, even before I supposedly do those things which I believe won't work out as I already have a self defeating attitude.... which maybe is my addiction rationalizing continuing drugs? How can I fucking leave drugs behind when I know how beautiful they made me feel when life and sober reality hurts not in a sharp way but in a numb way that accompanies my depression. I can't trust myself and feel like I am always going to be fucking reliant on substances. I don't believe in success and happiness for myself even before I try putting my hardest effort towards building my life. ",1525293774.0

I’ve been playing middle man for my old connection for the last couple months. My new connect always has oxys in various shapes and sizes. If he doesn’t have them he can have them in no time—the longest I’ve waited is maybe 2 hours? Anyways whenever my old connect runs out and can’t find anything they hit me up. Now in the beginning it was cool, they only needed me maybe once a week. I wasn’t asking for much, just a couple of the pills since they were usually buying around 50-60 30s and I was getting them cheaper then what they were paying. Fast forward to today I’ve been super busy the last couple weeks with final exams and I haven’t been able to help them. The other aspect of this is this guy lives even closer then my main connect, and whenever they have them they will bring them to me and sometimes even let me take some out on front. The problem is they are out at times. They already know if I were to give them this guys number that I’d expect to pay less then everyone since I did find the connect. However I had an idea that originates from a thread on this sub. What if I sold my plugs number to them for money? That way they would have a new connect and they will always have them and everyone can be happy. The only problem is I have no clue how much I would ask them for... can I get a little help from my nod squad on if you’ve ever sold your connect to a friend and if you have what did you ask for in exchange for the connection?

It's been roughtly a month since I started using again, 2x a week, and I'm learning new things about trying to use and not gain a dependency. 

Sub truths: 

You MUST set up a rule, and MUST follow it. Bending the rules always ends bad.


Kratom is a must on off days, don't try to chip without it.


I've decided to add a new rule. The break. Something I've ignored in the past, was it's okay, as long as you don't break rule one (never use more then 1 day in a row, and never more then 2x a week). I'm going to add, take an extended break after a month. 

So starting the following week, I will take a break from heroin (best time to do it, as it is Ramadan), so that I avoid tolerance and addiction.


In terms of my mental health, I've honestly never felt better about myself then I do now. With complete sobriety, it was complete lonliness, depression. With complete addiction, it as the same kind of misery. Like when I'm sober, I'm obsessing about NOT using drugs.


I don't want to be mentally obsessed with anyone. I want balance. That's the key word.


Balance.


For once in my life, I feel things aren't as unbalanced as I thought. The responsible using, and going to NA, and keeping myself in check has made the last few months. I was so miserable and depressed sober, I wasn't working, I was less productive. 


Balance. That's what I want. and I think approaching addiction like that can help alot of people who are struggling and can't iight addiction by complete abstinence.


Thoughts? Judgements? Penis pies? I know the topic of chipping, whether it's possible/not, stupid/Trumplike, etc can be a hot button, and there's some people who adamantly believe it is impossible. I think it is, I think people do it more often then we realize, but a lot of the people who do chip, don't realize they're chipping. I had a friend that used H with me off and on, never got addicted for a year. Then just stopped because he saw my withdrawel and was worried he was pushing it.

But I think posting these periodic entries about my journey into it is important for the sub  and future nod hogs (my new word for users!)

I'm pretty lit right now, but I hope I made sense.


**Rules (TLDR)** work in progress, trying to make this concise.

* Never use 2 days in a row. 2 days will leave you with mild WD, 3 days will result in full. This is only if you have been physically addicted to heroin in the past, and are trying to chip after some clean time (least a month, min).

* Utilize Kratom. This is a must if you are going to chip. Don't even try it without it. None of our will powers are that strong, you'll eff up too easy. Those off days aren't going to be like WD, but the day after using, I always get a hang over, and using seems to cure that. So take Kratom to avoid using 2 days in a row.

* I'm thinking of a 2 months on, 1 month break thing. I just feel that 1 month between 2 months, or every other month, a complete abstinence break, is key to not getting physically dependent. I think without those breaks, it gets far too easy to get to the ""fuck it"" point.

edit: Please fee free to contribute your own experiences. I'd like this to be a more comprehensive guide. I hoping to finally put some questions to rest and just create something useful for anyone whose gotten clean, and is miserable. Or anyone who is using alot and wants to how they can get to just chipping.

I play a lot of games, but I don't have a lot of friends (really any) that play. I want to play some, and I know some of you bois and gurls play, and play hard.


So my PSN is: Duraldo

Steam is the same.


Current games I'm looking for compatriots to co-op (is it called nod-op when you're high?) are:

*Far Cry 5- PS4


*PUBG (but I'm down for almost any PC co-op stuff)


*Sea of Thieves (PM me if you wanna search for booty, I share an xbox live account with a friend so I don't wanna post it here publicly). It's kinda boring and bare bones as a game, but I love trolling, having fun, PVPing other sloops, etc. And I want a young mate to be my friend!


*Elder Scrolls Online - I got all the expansions, a fairly high level character. So if you're interested in trying it out or whatever, I'd love to start a new character. Summerset isles comes out soon, if you're a huge Elder Scroll fan, your pants are wet.




I mainly like co-op stuff, but I almost never say no to a game of CS:GO (I suck at it, fair warning). So stuff like Diablo 3 (awesome game, I want to get into more, but it's bit of a bore with no friends). I also like 4x strat games like Crusader Kings, but never played those multiplayer before.


But yeah, looking  to start like an r/opiates gaming group. I always thought that loving video games has a strong correlation to loving opiates. I think I was addicted hardcore to video games before heroin, because they both allow the user to escape, both are ultimate forms of escapism.


So what games you playing on fam? And add me!! I'm also on discord, PM me though, I don't want to post it here for scammers to find as an easy target.


mods: My attempt to create a ""social"" r/opiates scene for us by using friendly competition/games/etc. Kinda the same thing I was trying to do with fent strip contests.  This time any rewards will be in-game ones.

*TLDR: Currently Playing Yakuza 6. I want friends to play other co-op games, add me on ps4/steam/xbox (has to be cross play games only like sea of thieves).*

Without specific sourcing I live in a highly popular city on the East Coast that has a huge open air market. Last night & over the past few months I've come across 2 stamps that have been cut with some sort of numbing product. The reason I could tell is because I am still a snorter. (I currently only do fent bags so I wasn't trying to avoid fent or anything) Few minutes after snorting the stuff my entire throat and anything else it came in contact with would be numb. I initially assumed that it was fentanyl cut with cocaine 
(or vice versa), however my brother IVs the same product and only got an opiate rush. It also didn't really feel like I did any coke. Though I guess if its fent and coke together the feeling might kind of level out? My guess is that since fentanyl is a purely white product some dealers have cut it with the same stuff they cut cocaine with or maybe simply it is cocaine cut with fent?! Not positive. Either way I am not a fan of it. 

Wish I could name the stamp without getting in trouble because I am sure people in my region would have come across both of them. My brother who copped both times we got those stamps told me both spots are popular and people loved the dope. 

I am actually headed to rehab soon and will be piss tested today. I am curious to see if my panel comes back for amphetamines. If it does then I'll make a fent/coke warning post or message mods to do so. ",1525271241.0

First Cold Cop gone wrong,"Yesterday, well its been about a full 24-28 hours that I’ve been up. Let’s just start with this i am leaving to Hawaii. Never been here before don’t know anyone just vacation right all i know is I’ve been withdrawing for a while and still haven’t been able to find someone in my new home town. So when i realize that I’m going on a 6 hour plane I’m freaking out because I don’t want to be in ugly pain for  6-7 hours. And just the duration of my trip for my 5 days i didnt want to destory it because me always complaining about not feeling good to my husband. 

Now i was reading cold cop stories or how to cold cop on—etc. so i tried a few of those method yesterday nothing worked. So i saw one girl post about going on grinder and asking people. Now let me just say this. I am gay. But i am married. My husband knows of my addiction and kind of knew that i was going on grinder to find pills. Been asking people all day, just a simple do you have “ insert pill emoji” or know anyone who has “ emoji” LOL talked to a few people got a lot of no’s 
 But i just created a profile with my name age, no photo. So no one was really responding to me
I’m not the most attractive person but i am 20. So i am young. So i post my profile picture instantly 10 people message and tap me. I ask. And ask until finally one older guy who was in his mid 40’s says i have several prescriptions what you need. I ended up having a legit hour conversation with him. Told him the honest truth of what’s going on in my life, why i need it. How stupid i am that I’m to scared to ask around for pills. He said i actually have one Perc 30. I was like ... —omg

He ends up saying i do need it. But i know people in your situation. I was defiantly in your situation a few years ago. You wont die bud. But you most likely are suffering. He says. If i was on a plane for 6 hours without it. With having to shit every 10 seconds, cold sweats, head aches. I’d want to find dope before leaving too.. 

Now I’m sure many of us who are addicted or even dependent on this stuff is like me. When something is the most stupidest thing that can possibly get me robbed, shot or even just raped. It didnt cross my mind that meeting someone at there house at 3 am who you don’t know and who is off a gay hook up. Even what would happen if this older guy would want sex in return, or money or just something crazy. 

What stuck in my mind was o he hAs 1 JUsT 4 MeEeEee <333!!! 

Ended up driving to his house with my husband in the car. Bc scared to go alone! Now where i live is that there isn’t many lights at night. So it was pitch dead dark black. At 3:20 i get there. He says wait by the red truck. Now i told him ill give him money I don’t care it doesn’t matter. 

He ended up just coming to my window and saying i hope this helps you. Give me a pill wrapped in plastic. I said thank you it really does. 

Now the one thing is that I’m happy about is that. This guy was just really nice and respectful and totally understanding. Completely random to. I just think he was scared that i might be a cop or something cause he ran off right after. 

Now that 100% saved me today. My flight was at 8:15 am. Got off the plane at 11:15 PM (Hawaii Time) and i slept for the entire duration of the flight and was okay feeling good for the next 12 hours. 
— until i figure I’m going to be here for 5 days i have to try and cop some from someone... 

I find this guy smoking pot, young white. He asked me for a cigarette and if i wanted to buy pot, I said no do u have other things. He said yeah later tonight though.. i got his number he got mine 

Now I’m excited I’m like WOW My Trip isn’t going to be ruined or just be in pain the majority of the time. 
So a couple hours strike he says to come meet him. Next thing i know his phones dead. 
I wait at this spot for like a hour. 

Then 2 hours later. Says sorry my phone died come to where i met you, okay so i take a Uber back to where i met him.  He texts me and says they’re 10$ each. Perc 10’s. And his minimum is 20 pills. So i don’t have all the money in the world. But I knew that that was stupid to give 200$ for 20 pills. When i normally give 200 and get 40 pills back in Las Vegas. But i was okay with doing it anywhere... 
next thing i know he says meet me at some other place 2 blocks away i say okay. I’m here. 

Oh walk to the mcdonalds. Okay walks to mcdonalds which was a mile away. In my head I’m like Y didnt u just tell me to take my Uber to this mcdonalds then?
But i figured something weird Was up. Why so many different locations. I forgot what he looked like tbh until i finally met him. But i went with my husbands cousin. And me and her once we seen him we were like OH he’s following us. Probably to see what were doing if were police. I don’t know. Alright so at 10pm i meet him. Well lit area in front of this mcdonalds. I give him 200$ cash. He give me a news paper with the pills 
He walks away. He says thank u call me if u need more,  
I show my husbands cousin. She said u just got royally fucked. 
These aren’t percs. They were (ORANGE pills with B12 written on them) she told me though. Before he u give him the money make sure you google and see what these pills are.  Once she seen him she said I don’t know how i feel about this guy he looks sketchy. Well the bitch was right. He gave me something else ran off with my 200$ and it was ugly. That never happened to me before. I was so excited for my pills. Just to be happy and okay again. 
But i got screwed over. 

But see before this trash guy. My husbands cousin had a connection with someone cause she lives here. So we were calling her connection but she didn’t answer. 

A couple hours later. I end up getting drunk after being pissed off.  Her connection come though. And FML another 10$ a pop for Perc 10’s but at least they were real and someone who was trusted. 

This is probalay all over the place but i just wanted to tell what happened to me because i suffered and people are cruel. Well i cant say that. Everyone’s cruel, you. Me my ferret Farrah. You know. But it was my fault because I’m so young and I’ve always had connections. I never had to go and find and seek out other people. The way i found my people before were from friends where I used to live. But Im saying this because people look at me and see. Oh he’s a punk kid lets fuck him over. Cause i am to trusting. I don’t even know why. 	maybe because the excitement of the drugs being in my hand. But as of typing right now i popped 2 10mg percs. And i can finallly f u c k i n g 
Go to sleep. 
Also. 
I always seem to get like comments on certain things like I’m doing something wrong. Sorry if i didnt explain it right or even said something wrong I wasn’t supppost to. I just look on the/ for pill porn and stories. So here’s my story about what happened today. 

Watch out. Y’all are more smarter than i am. But I’m not that pissed cause there’s nothing i can do about being fucked over like that. Besides get frustrated. But defiantly something i read all the time happening. He probably thought.i was just a tourist looking to get high...

Today I insufflated 20mg of extremely clean afghan #3, not realising how serious long half life benzos can affect you the next day, I was nodding out but not in  a good way, the euphoria was minimal but my god i could not see straight and was stumbling all over the place.

Thank God I didn't take a higher dose as I fear I may have literally been dead, after taking a bit of polish amp sulfate I seem to be okay but this a seriously understaded issue. Do NOT use opiates with benzos still in your system, diazepam has a half life of up to 100 hours, so even if you may feel fine you are still putting yourself at serious risk of respatory depression.

I'm hoping this message will reduce harm, many people do not understand the serious dangers of combining depressants.

I'm back again to bother all you awesome people for advice and guidance.  So, quick recap, I have chronic pain and, as many of you know, it's incredibly difficult to get doctors to prescribe opiate pain relievers.  I generally take around 7.5 \- 15mg of oxycodone a night...I mostly manage to deal with the pain throughout the day, it's helpful knowing that I'll have some relief when I get home.  Honestly, it's knowing that I have that relief that even allows me to attempt to do a lot of activities.  

ANYYYWAYY...I recently started getting from a new person.  They get from a few different people.  I'm concerned about the legitimacy of the stuff I'm getting \- not in the dangerous way, but more in the rip off way.  I don't feel like I'm feeling these pills as much as I should \- just overall and in terms of pain relief.  So, I guess I'd like to hear your tips for spotting fakes...and I would really love it if any of you had any input on specific types of reagents to use \(I know there are a few that can be used for opiates\) and, further, if you had brand preference or places that you felt most comfortable getting from.  Most of the posts I've found on drug testing focus on MDMA and LSD testing and when it is about opiates, it's usually people \(rightfully\) concerned about fentanyl, it's hard to find people who are attempting to make sure shit is just straight legit, so I'm feeling a little lost about the process.  I don't think that they're like full sugar pills or anything, but maybe just really weak cuts...so, ideally it would be great if there was a test that could give you actual info regarding amount of a substance in a sample, but I don't think that is a reality, so I'll be happy just knowing for sure what is actually in it.

It feels so good to e x tend m y less out as str8 and f flexed as possible, oh yeah stretch those knees out flex hard and work em!  I have my whole legs tight from thigh to my toes. Oh yeah the toes they are attempting to dig up the concrete floor"" Ohhh it feels so good, hurry push on your eyes....Mmmm! My legs seem to be dancing with one another. My feets are kinda twerking.
 Oh wow the hydroponic smack description seems to have temporarily been forgotten about. Thank God I remembered. This heroin has been blessed by The Good Lord Himself. (Notice the caps man.....) Mucho Respecto Senor! This piece of heaven comes in very hard rocks that go (clunk) when you drop them down onto the table.IT takes some elbow grease to break them up by pressing on it wrapped in a business card with a hard heavy object..... Fun Stuff.I take my time and nod out a lot and have up for days craziness going on....who me, I'm not crazy. Period. You see, PERIOD!!! ME NO! My legs are having a dance off... None stop cobra snake charming movements. Working them ankles good and hard flex and extend those knees, Ohhh yeah bounce them....Ohhh so good$. The burn baby, the burn!!
Every other sentence I re reread what I wrote, well typed.  Why do you got to be so technical. I'm tired if fixing mistakes, there is quite a few. My life seems like a mistake.....My Dad once told me I was a mistake and that the best part of me ran down my mothers leg ....like 5 minutes later he gave me ice cream. Oh no I almost forgot about the sweet luscious HEROIN! OHHH yes I love it. So once you get it smashed I like to put about 30 cc warm water on it. No additional heat. I smash it up pretty well with the back of the needle. Let it sit for a while while I nod a little and tweak a wee bit, GOD I love speedballs. Oh y rah and I tend to the other caps too , in unison, kinda like a farmer, I like run on sentences and hate spell/ check/ suggest , yeah whatever! Mmmm Bach to the Heroin Cap! Do you ever notice how when Heroin is written the HERO part is always bigger, emphasized.  .....hmmmmm! My legs are flapping like a flying bird. Back and fourth to digging "" pressing flexing flapping. I have q food bun all thought my legs toes calves. I like it this way ..... Oh yeah work it, burn baby burn. Bulge them eyes out, cross the close them hard to you see purple, deep purple....press them like a button .....mmmmm oh yeah bite down on that toung.Speedballind yeah I 've speed balling. If you would stop interrupting me I could finish telling you about the HEROin. Its not that dark looking the powder, but as soon as the water hits it BOOM! LIKE ABRA CADBRA man.. .dark like chocolate, well almost. It is so dark that you can't see your life juice register, you got to watch for the right speed of it filling up, let it fill up a little bit then Bam that plunger Down! Bloom! To the moon Baby. Yeah the mega 3 cap shot I'm describing here was 90 cc so I do not have much room to work with to register, careful....... 70 plus dollars in that rig, 30 plus minutes of prep time and all of my love!
What is really remarkable about this HEROin is the fact of how dark it is and when you draw it up though the cotton, w hen it is all in your rug no longer in the cap, its like magic....the cotton turns back to pure white. No residue left in the cotton and the awesome part is remember that 30 cc of water added to th mix, now it is 40 plus!!!!! Abraa CADBRA!!!! Grade A+++++ HEROin! My Guy delivers in 2 to 20 minutes. HE WILL TELL YOU A PARKING LOT TO MEET UP.IN and sometimes there will be 5 to 6 other fellow junkies waiting on him. Some in cars, some on footsie on bikes.

Imagine having a hot coal or white hot coat hanger embedded in your neck or arm, ALL OF THE TIME. 
So the plan is now to keep on the Gaba/Tramadol mix while I do physical therapy for 6-8 weeks. If no results, then I move on to either minimally invasive surgery or a full blown fusion. My hope is that the PT works, but I'm prepared for the worst if necessary.

Her life was endless agony due to health problems completely out of her control and she didn't know from one week to the next if the prescriptions she needed to live would be available. The stress, combined with the unending physical pain, drove her to kill herself.

More and more pain patients are where this woman was -- denied relief and being forced to either end their suffering permanently or start thinking about buying their opiates illegally.

Your advice is needed: In general, what should we know when we have to start finding ""unofficial help""? We're in wheelchairs or using canes, limping, barely able to move... yeah, we're a pretty pathetic bunch. All ages, all colors, male and female, young, old, some are disabled vets, some are great-grandmothers. Mostly, we'll want pills (probably no needles). We'll probably be crying (we do that a lot).

We're living with everything from broken backs, shattered spines, birth defects, neurological disorders, crippling arthritis and heart disease to cancer, including end-stage cancer. Yes, the DEA is even trying to take opiates away from the dying!

We need your advice: How do we avoid a fentanyl surprise? How do we avoid getting busted? How do we find someone willing to help us? Where do we start?

Many of us believed drug use was a terrible thing that only ""bad"" people did. But over time chronic pain has a way of changing attitudes and beliefs. Just ask us. Ask us what we think of a government more interested in punishing than helping. Ask us what we think of an attorney general whose advice to suffering Americans is ""take two aspirin and tough it out.""

Obviously I don’t want to get addicted or even do this multiple times, it just seems like heroin can provide the strongest pleasurable sensation a human can feel. It’s one of the strongest experiences life has to offer. This makes me really want to try it just once in my lifetime to see how it feels. 

Do you think this is reasonable or is human willpower not strong enough for an average person to be able to do this without getting addicted?

I know the idea that you try something once and you’re immediately addicted is bullshit, which makes me think it’s not that insane as long as I make a deal with myself to never do it again after the first time. But on the other hand, people with different personalities respond to addictive drugs differently and if you’re on the less orderly and more impulsive side (which I definitely am) you’re more likely to get addicted, so this makes me think it might not be a good idea.

I just want to try it once and stop immediately. I’ve been told the first time is the best and it becomes less and less impactful after that anyway.

So, people who have tried it and do/don’t regret it, would you advise me to try it once and then stop or keep away from it entirely? Did you have this same plan and if so, did it fail or not? If you advise me not to try it I definitely won’t. Thanks in advance!",1525212432.0

8gb7m4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8gb7m4/idea_for_an_app_to_prevent_ods/,35,https://redd.it/8gb7m4,Native_Nod,Idea For An App to Prevent ODs,"So lately I've been thinking about relapses. Im too scared to personally, with all the ODs and fent going around on the west coast atm. I ultimately decided against it, but that got me thinking; how could someone use **safely** without triggering a relapse in now-clean friends, being ostracized, etc? 

I know there are apps where you hold down a button and if you release, 911 is automatically called. But this presents a problem. If someone simply nods out and doesnt OD and then 10 mins later the cops are at their door... Well that person isnt gonna use that service again. This is especially problematic in states w/o Good Samaritan laws, and could possibly lead to the users arrest.. OR alternatively, if someone ODs with the phone in their hand, finger still on the button, its not gonna help for shit, either.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**So heres the idea:**

 I call it ""*OD Free*"". Its an app. A bunch of junkies download the app. When you have it downloaded, notifications are on automatically. You enter in a pre-recorded message and an emergency contact number (could be a roomate/parent with Narcan, could be your local emergency services).

So lets say you need to do a shot at 2AM. You have no one there to watch you. So instead you open the app, and hit ""find a sitter"". This sends a notification to other people that have the app downloaded. It will choose people who are in a timezone that is most likely to be awake at the time you're using. So if you're in NY at 2am it might send notifications to people in LA where it's 11pm. Itll say something like *""Native_Nod is trying to get well""*. When someone swipes the notification it'll connect you two via video chat.

The person can then watch you do your shit and make sure youre okay. Ideally you should be all prepped and ready to go when you hit ""find a sitter"" for politeness sake. Then you blast off. The person can ask if youre okay through the video chat, and if things look dire they simply hit a button on their screen that says *""call for help""* or something similar. This triggers a call to whichever number you entered and plays the prerecorded message. So it can call your roomates number you entered in, and say ""GET THE NARCAN I FELL OUT"". Or lets say they dont pickup, the call will be forwarded to your local emergency services, and a message tells them your location and the situation. 

Also, people that swipe the notification to be a ""sitter"" regularly get priority when finding a sitter. I mean you dont have to watch people do their shot all day (though you can if you want). But answering a call or two a day will get you top priority. Also there would also be a ""Rate your Sitter"" system as well for behavior etc. So people who act shitty/irresponsibly/maliciously will get low scores, and will stop being allowed to babysit people. People can get flairs for *""X number of lives saved""* next to their Username, etc. So you'll know when you're in good hands.

This would be a great thing for all users to have, but it would be **really useful** to people that relapse. Because when you relapse with a lot of clean time, you feel like you can't ask anyone to watch you fix. The shame and the fear that news of your relapse will get around to the wrong people is real. And it contributes to the OD rates among relapses. This would keep people safe without worrying about being outed. Harm reduction is always priority, remember.

But yeah thats it. Tell me what you guys think

I wish I was an app developer and could make this shit myself but im not. But if anyone *is* then hmu, maybe we could plan some stuff or something.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Edit:** While were at it, why not add a ""Harm Reduction info"" tab on the app, and have things like a opiate dose-conversion calculator, pill identifier, safe injection and sterilization guides, links to nearby needle exchanges, which drugs not to mix, etc. Just go for dope-app market domination straight away. Like your own little pokedex for dope. Call it ""The Junkies Pocket Companion""? ""Pocket Junkie +""? Lol. I'm just spitballing over here",1525203287.0

He got addicted to h about 5 years ago when the pills just weren't doing it anymore. He has stolen and pawned our parents stuff and my stuff. I have watched him go through dt's one too many times and I have cried myself to sleep too much over him. I have watched him OD twice. He was put in prison January 2017 cause he got caught shooting up in a public bathroom he got out in October and was clean. He was doing great for a while then I guess he relapsed and got a bag got drunk, beat his gf and woke up with no recollection of any of it. My son loves his uncle John to death but I don't want to see him get hurt because he doesn't understand why he can't see him as he is only 3. My father was and still is (I guess) an alcoholic with very bad anger issues and I'm scared that maybe this addiction thing has something to do with genetics. In scared my bro will never STAY clean again. I'm scared he will relapse again and end up taking too much. I'm scared I'm going to lose him. I just want my old brother back, he has turned into a monster. I remember taking him to the ""trap house"" one day and then he decided he was going to shoot it up while I was driving right in front of me, my old bro would never think of doing something like that in front of me.

So i've decided to get micron filters for a good filtering process before I inject. I have 2 chemicals which is heroin and ketamine.

I have 1 micronfilter from before which is a PES 0.2µ micron filter which I bought from a mushroom cultivation site. I'm not sure if this micronfilter will work? I've read that PTFE and PP filters will fit best for ketamine filtering, but I can't find what's best for heroin. And is is significant differences between PTFE/PVFD/PP/NYLON/PES? Can my old filters work?

Would my PES filter work fine? Or else I have to get new ones and shipping takes hella long. 

What i'm gonna do is: I have 20ml bacteriostatic water with 0.9% benzyn alcohol, so I'm gonna mix 1g with 10ml (or less ex. 500mg with 5ml etc) in the ketamine solution inside a vial as sterile as possible and this is where I want a good filter.

This community is wonderful and knowledgeable, so I’m hoping I can get some accurate feedback in regards to my Suboxone script. 

1) I have heard that I MUST be in withdrawals to use them. My dr said “wait 48 hrs after last use” but he didn’t really say “and def be in full withdrawal.” Now, 48 hrs from last use goes hand in hand you’d think, but I’ve done so much partying on a given night before & had so much of a given opiate in my system, that come the 48th hour later, I’m in slight but not full withdrawal. Full withdrawals, yes? Not just light chills, sneezing, slightly uncomfortable start of withdrawaling, but full-fledged. 

2) While I know everyone’s dose is different, I’ve heard it is wise to cut one’s dosage by about half. I’m on 16 mg/day, or 8mg & 8mg/day & night. I was thinking of quartering my strip and dissolving 2mg at a time, waiting an hr, then upping if need be, perhaps not even using the nightly dose. Is this recommended?

3) Is there any poss way to use a strip, then wait till I need it next, & use it then? For ex, if a 2 mg strip relieves withdrawal symptoms for 3 days, can I use a strip on Thurs & wait till Sun a.m. to dissolve one again? I’m not looking forward to getting hooked on these.

I'm thinking it's infected and have been having headaches for like a week straight. Yesterday it was absolutely unbearable so I went to urgent care.

I had a young-ish doctor, probably a few years younger than me (early 20's) come in, ask what was wrong, and then asked ""So what do you want to get out of this visit?""

I told him, ""Well the tooth is scheduled to be pulled in a week, but the way it hurts, I think it might be infected. I've heard that sometimes dentists won't pull teeth if theyre infected and I don't want to have to wait any longer than I have to if it is.""

He said.... ""Well, I imagine you probably want something for the pain too.""

""Well, If I can get something, it'd be amazing, but I know If I come in specifically asking for it, I'm probably not going to get any help.""

He looks over my charts, asks if the hydrocodone I got last time there was alright and I said it was... He also said he couldn't be sure if it was infected, but he'd write a script of antibiotics in case it was.

Then he took a look at the tooth and goes.... ""Yeah, I can see what you're talking about, that tooth is pretty jacked up. I'm not supposed to give you anything here since you drove yourself, but my nurse will be back in a few minutes.""

She came back with a roxi 10 and the first antiobiotic, and told me that ibuprofen and tylenol would get me through the rest of the night.

Doc came back with a script for amoxicillin and 12 roxi 5's (Not really much, but better than the 10 hydro's I was *maybe* expecting)

So I got the roxi's first thing this A.M. [and it's gone](https://youtu.be/TGwZVGKG30s)

I'm thinking about waiting another day or two and calling back to see if he'll hook me up with a few more, just because I can hardly get out of bed with the headaches this tooth is giving me, but hopefully the antibiotics ease it up a bit... 

Anyways, It was just a very nice experience to have a doctor recognize I was really in pain, and go above and beyond to try and ease it.... (He couldve given me hydro 5's and called it a day)

If I insuffafed 1.5mg of suboxone at 7am, will a .5 sack of bth do anything about 11 hours later?

I know that this was a dumb question that’s been asked a million times but I couldn’t figure out how to search /r/opiates specifically so I’m sorry in advance for creating another post. 

/EDIT/

Okay so... being the impatient junk-box that I am, I did what 7/10 of us would do with 1/2 a gram of BTH in our hands and I smoked it. All of it. I think the BTH overpowered the buprenorphine and I got around 75% of my high. Should I have waited? Absolutely. Should I have saved some for the morning to get the full effects? Absolutely. Do I regret my decision? Absolutely not. 

So for those of you who find themselves in my predicament, be aware of the fact that you’ll only feel a portion of your stuff. I strongly recommend waiting like everyone said. But the bottom line is that YOU WILL FEEL IT, just not all of it, so it’s really up to you as to how to approach it. I think it’s because 1.5mg of bupe just can’t cover all your receptors.",1525135982.0

Rhode Pharma: I've tried the MSContin and Oxycodone variants produced by Rhode Pharma. Both have been good consistently over a span of 2 years. I've enjoyed both thoroughly. Rhode Pharma also makes a lot of opiates that are sought after in the community and have great generics! 

Epic Pharma: I tried the Oxycodone Hydrochloride by Epic Pharma. The pills have been uniform in appearance. When chewed, no bad taste. They however aren't very good. Epic Pharma is a producer of generics and has an reputation for being a bad brand. As for their effects. The oxycodone high is felt but it lasts very short compared to the traditional Rhode Pharma Oxycodone. Lasting around 45 minutes compared to the original 60 mins (high wise) bringing about limited euphoria for that timespan.

Pfizer: Tried the new MSContin that had Naloxone in it. I believe it was called embeda. Not that good. Morphine really didn't have any effect and was abuse-proof and none of what I did seemed to grant me access to the embedded morphine. Naloxone seemed to make problem areas in which I hurt (I have to take pills for chronic pain, self medicate.) worse. I took Suboxone before and have noticed this problem but lesser on their form of Naloxone. Could be due to Pfizer's brand?

8g3cab,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8g3cab/would_you_survive_part_1/,33,https://redd.it/8g3cab,dwnsouthpoison,Would you survive? Part 1,"I see a lot of new users of heroin on here. Maybe this will be of some use to the ones just getting a little taste of that bittersweet lifestyle... the following is my actual situation in life at the moment.

In a seedy motel. Two of them sit together with a homeless camp between them, making way to some tents and a group of around twenty vagrants. ""Wrong part of town"" doesn't cut it - this is a full-blown cesspool where you'll find nothing but crackheads with full-blown AIDS. As a male in my twenties, some random 40 year old ex-con offered me good money to prostitute myself or... ""just get my dick sucked."" Sternly turned it down. You can't show weakness out here. Everyone's out for themselves.

And it's annoying as fuck - everyone thinks they're the plug. You can't walk ten feet from the motel in any direction without being driven up on by a ""dboy"" 80% of the time looking to be your new crack middle, 20% of the time half-willing to let you jump in while he drives up the block, then charges you double for $10 bags.

It's getting exceedingly dangerous and it seems like I'm getting more desperate all the time. I tried to purposely avoid getting caught up in any ""drama"" a few nights ago and just stayed in my room... when one of my ""boys"" from the hood decided to swing by. I was pretty fucking dopesick - and if anyone's ever had a massive $20 blast of crack while you're jonesing for anything to make your skin stop crawling.... 5 minutes later it's the worst mistake of your life. That's when we saw the camper.

In the cut, between the motels. A white guy, a mexican guy, and an older chick were heavily drunk while the mexican was trying to count out enough money to walk back down to the corner store. My boy's gaze tightened down on the cut they were in. ""You see that?"" He said, in a half whisper. He was already turning the handle of the door to walk outside, and I was already following him. Instead of walking around to the cut, he crept across the parking lot.

And I'm right behind.

He jumps the fence. ""Give me all that, bro!"" I hear a thunderous boom when a bunch of glass smashes. I guess my boy had picked up a beer bottle and smashed it right over the Mexican's head. Totally fucking unnecessary right? Wrong, if you're anywhere near my situation. 

The lady and the white dude put up a decent fight. But here's where things go from bad to just.... sad. Seeing that my boy and I had the upperhand on a knocked out mexican, a white boy, and some old lady holding down a camper and a pickup truck, about five or six ""vultures"".... ie. homeless junkies sleeping in the cut swarmed all over them with bats and hammers like some kind of scene out of hell.

While we were running back with our take of $180, we could hear every window in the camper smashing and a good deal of screaming. At that point the police came and literally did nothing. Sound like a good life? I'm in my room alone right now thinking about what I'm gonna do when this money hits my account at midnight.

I should go to the sub doctor.

He's only 3.5miles from my motel.

But as soon as I open that door....",1525125763.0

I feel SO much better without Suboxone,"Maybe some of you read my post yesterday talking about my quick suboxone taper after over 2 years of being on it. For those who didn't I'll give a quick overview. A few weeks ago I got busted, knowing I'd have to go to jail I decided rather than sneaking a bunch of subs in rectally I'd just try a quick taper (from 6mg/day). It's weird, the less suboxone I have in my system the more clear-headed I feel. Today is day 2 without ANY suboxone and man, I feel like myself again. I'll add that I'm taking gabapentin for this process and it's been a tremendous help, a godsend in fact, but I already posted about that. I know what a lot of you will say, ""it's only day 2, you haven't even got to the worst part"" or ""it's too early to say your feeling better for sure"", but the fact is I tapered down very quickly(8 days from 6mg/day to none), and I've truly been able to feel the difference each day, feeling more like myself everyday.  For those of you wondering if life will ever be the same after the long road of addiction, i just want to say there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Us addicts have that guilt within us, that feeling that we've left behind ourselves and replaced it with a shittier, less important version. Remember that you can always make changes, no matter how long you've been stuck in the cycle. Learn to love yourself. Even if your the lowest you've ever been you can still turn it around. Life is tough, no one will argue against that. But whatever you do, don't forget that person within you that used to work out, spend time in the sun, love your significant other, IS STILL THERE.

Was very privledged had nice clothes my mom bought had a 4 year education paid for but besides that money was a very taboo topic. I had heard that i had money from my grandparents my whole life but didn't know for sure. Eventually I realized how the financial markets work and found out I was sitting on a sjzeabke amount of cash that was in my grandparents and my name. Even tho at the age of 21 it would legally be mine they still had it tied to there investments up in the city. So at the age of 26 I finally sais fuck it. My nana made a mistake when sending me my tax info and I saw the balance of my account. I called my broker. They had it set up do this triggered an immediate phone call to them my grandparents even tho it was all mine because of the way the trust was set up. Fast forward there pissed I blow thru a hefty amount partying balls. Everyone in my family knows this but I was independent enough that they really couldnt do much about it. My nana decided to meet me and offered to bail me our of a few debts if I signed the money over to her for safe keeping till i got my head on straight.  I was sick and tired of calling the broker to order my money and blowing thru it. My junky ass wanted cash that day motha fucker! So under duress I agreed. Now 2 years later and a recent first arrest for DUi I was fired from the family business and could really use this cash. She is not budging one bit doesn't wanna enable me. Does anyone have experience suing over money because of signing under duress?

I always try to remember my buddy Gerry's life because lord knows he didn't have too many friends. Anniversary of his passing is coming up.  Toward the end of the story was when I got on methadone so I was basically out of the picture by that point.

Gerry had been shooting heroin for at least two decades by the time we met.  I was getting involved in things that I shouldn't have with a girl who was nothing but trouble.  Always scheming for cash, she ended up meeting someone and moving away for a while. This, of course didn't stop me from befriending her old roommate and hanging out with the revolving door crowd of junkies all day.   

That is how I met Gerry, who was sleeping on a mattress in the basement after being homeless.  Now, ol' Gerry was a man of action.  He had a big list of numbers in his phone, so I figured I would hang with him for the day.  Between him middling, me driving and (sometimes) buying dope, we at least stayed well most days.  This set up worked pretty good for most of the summer, until J steps into the picture.  She was apparently an old flame of Gerry's, and had just gotten back from prison.  Oh boy.  Now our little operation is off balance and Gerry loses a lot of his people because he's ripping them off too bad.  J loves her xanax bars and IV dope, I'm surprised she didn't die with how fucked up this chick would get.  Heres where the story gets fucky.  J is dating a guy, a non user, and is being dropped off at the spot by this guy.  He's giving her money to stay well.. and now she's contributing and getting us high.  Gerry and J are also bangin' in the basement.   


One day, the only place we can get our fix is across the state line.. Gerry can't get there and J has the idea to ask her guy, introducing Gerry as roommate 'Scott' because this guy knows who 'Gerry' is and does not like him.   This works once, so of course they start pushing it.  J steals a bunch of cash from her sick dad and goes to jail, oops.  Gerry steals his real roommate's rent money to get well and they get evicted, oops.  Around this time, Gerry also had a very bad abscess in his leg that required a nursing home stay, wound vac, the works.  A month or so later, Gerry is discharged and almost immediately picked up for a warrant.  He spends 20 days in jail, and then released homeless and penniless. Where does he go?  To J's guy's house.  The guy feels bad for 'Scott' and gives him a room, food and smokes and tries to help him up.  Ol' Gerry was a dope addict through-and-through, and it didn't take him very long to scrape something together.  Again, the story gets fuckier:  Gerry ODs and dies in the guy's house while he is out.  Only when police and EMTs show up to cart him off does the poor guy learn he hasn't been helping 'Scott' but has in fact been supporting Gerry, a man he had vowed to hate.  

Its easy to judge people like him..  but, RIP Gerry, you crazy motherfucker.

These opiates are not for the heavy user, which is generally most people. Moderate tolerances and above will make a lot of opiates impractical to obtain in the amounts necessary to get a high.

Tramadol is a low-key awesome opiate for people that aren't moderately-heavily tolerant. Not only is it dollar store cheap, it give a very nice and prevalent stimulation on top of a euphoric, relaxing, and motivating high. Very few opiates will actually give you a stimulating effect; Oxycodone, Kratom, and maybe Vicodin have this property as well.

You can get stuff done while not feeling lazy, and it can have good lasting duration. Of course, you aren't gonna like Trams if you  have to snort 60+mg of oxy or shoot up a few bags of dope just to hit the buzz. Trams are a good middle ground in between Kratom and O-DSMT(the metabolite of trams and tapentadol) powder. 
The only opiates I do are Kratom, Tramadol, and Tapentadol, and your tolerance builds very slowly with these substances. For almost 11 months, I consume 7-14 grams of Kratom daily, and 200mg of Trams here and there always has got me very goody goody feelin'.

As for Tapentadol, it is without a doubt the most overlooked opiate around, and seriously underrated. It is hard to find the IR version, which gives a moderate rush that feels almost indistinguishable from oxy when you pop 50-100mg and it mimics a 20ish mg oxy high. However, I am not a chaser of the ""rush"" effect for opiates, or any type of drug. ER(Nucynta) Tapentadol at 150-200mg doses doses feels like a more solid hitting Tramadol, and is dollar store cheap as well, but it is considerably harder to find, outside of DNM vendors. Tapentadol will kick ass for anyone with a light-average tolerance, and I know many moderate users who enjoy popping 300-400mg of Nucynta for a 7ish hour high. 

As for seizures, I don't enjoy the fear mongering that is forced into this sub-reddit from people who have experienced a seizure off Tramadol, know someone who did, or simply has never experienced Tramadol and just throws shade everywhere. Let me explain: YES, Tramadol and Tapentadol can end up surfacing seizures in a small population of people. HOWEVER, this effect is only existent in people who take HEAVY doses(the risk increases above 400mg for Tramadol, but the average doses of seizure appearances seems to be above 700-900mg), those who are PREDISPOSED to seizures, and those who combine Tramadol in heavy excess with stuff like Gabapentin, certain stimulants such as: MDMA, MDPV, A-PVP, and 4-FA, heart medication, and psychedelics like 2C-x compounds, 25-x compounds, synthetic cannibinoids, PCP and it's analogues, and other dissociates(I don't believe ketamine is included in this, but this is speculation).

I was once prescribed Tramadol for post recovery from a car crash, and I am prescribed 90mg of Adderall IR daily(3 x 30mg tablets; one at 8am, 12pm, and 4pm) and the doc said there isn't an issue with Trams and Addy, although I don't use my Adderall to get high I actually need it for severe ADD, so I don't think amphetamine or dextroamphetamine are a prevalent danger with Tramadol.

I have also used Tramadol in conjunction with N-ethyl-hexedrone and N-ehtyl-pentredone(Trams+ one or the other, not all three), and research I did along with personal experience seems like the seizure threshold is slightly more prevalent when combining these two, but staying within safe dose ranges with the two compounds and not compulsively redosing them is fine. I actually love this combination and it seriously softens the comedown of the hexen, as well as making a unique and euphoric speedbally effect.

In conclusion: this isn't a rip on people who had terrible times with Tramadol induced seizures. It is terrible and awful this happened to you and I feel sympathetic to your story and appreciate y'all being open to others who are wondering about this substance. This is more directed at those who compare Tramadol equally to our shitty friend ""codeine"", those who say ""good luck with your future seizures"", and those who shoot heavy amounts of opiates and were expecting Tramadol and Tapentadol to get them high. I hope this will clear the fears and misinformation some people have that are on the fence about these two compounds.

I wanted to do an informed decision.

I've done many drugs in the past, still do. Weed, LSD, magic mushrooms, Meth, amphetamines, MDMA, DMT, ketamine, 2cb, many RC's such as 4-aco-dmt, loads of stims, and I use benzos stictly 2x week for 2-3 years now, and I've ALWAYS been able to keep my usage strictly recreational. I've gone some weeks without benzos without a problem. 

I've always been able to control my usage. Even with meth, it actually wasn't that hard to use occasionally.

1 week ago I tried heroin for the first time. My first opiate.

It is UNBELIEVABLE the ammount of cravings I had the very first day. I wanted to smoke once and get the gist of it to see what is this substance everyone talks about, and says to be so good, so addictive. I had to feel it.

I've seen a lot of heroin/fentanyl/opiate related documentaries. I've always had an intrest in these. But because of the warnings and from what people kept telling me (do not try opiates if you don't need to), I decided to skip it.

I know the risks. I know what expects me if I adventure down the road of addiction.

First day I smoked once. I smoked twice. then 3 times. I smoked 4 times by the end of the day.

The following day was insane. I wanted nothing but smoke some H. Every thought I had was about it. I smoked all day long.

3rd day, first thought when I woke up wasn't even checking the phone. it was heroin.
By night before sleep, my last thought was also heroin. It was heroin on my mind all day long, obsessively, compulsively, sickly.

It's been a week and I understand now the mistake I did in buying 2.5 grams of heroin.

I literally cannot stop thinking about smoking some more. Writting this as I'm close to nodding. Smoked some few minutes ago.

As someone who has no friends, never had a grilfriend and is 22 years old, I've always felt lonely. I've always felt a hole in my soul. I wanted to be with someone, to share my world with someone. To feel loved. To feel like someone cares about me unconditionally.

Heroin pretty much covered all those holes. I don't feel like I need friends anymore, much less a girlfriend.

When I'm on H, I'm beatifully fine as I am. 

So here I am a week later. I've meditated 20 minutes in the morning to see if I could get heroin usage in control. It was the hardest meditation session I've had to date, and I've meditated for some years now on and off.

In 20 minutes heroin popped up in my mind at least 100 times. It is INSANE.

**Don't get me wrong. This has been the happiest week of my life in years.** It is as if I had found my soulmate.

Just needed to vent. Have a good day",1525080026.0

I took my daughter to her doctors appt earlier today I left my purse at home and the only two people there were my son and his best friend (who I also consider a son).

 They've been best friends since they were like 4 and they are 16 now.. Regardless one of them or both of them stole my whole bottle of pills.. I don't even know which one of them did it. I just went to take my pill and there is 12 pills left... I did the math and there should be 36 pills left (roughly) and there is 12. That is a lot of pills missing!

I'm so upset right now and so worried. I'm more worried then upset and I don't know who did it. I talked to them both together and separately and they are insisting they didn't do it but they were the only ones here. I'm thinking they both did and there is no way 2 people did that many pills in a few hours so there must be pills hidden or on them? Especially with no tolerance? 

 I want to tear his room apart but if he didn't do it and I didn't find them I don't know what to do???  
I feel so betrayed and so worried. I love both of these kids with all my heart. They are literally my babies. Both of them! 

I am so upset right now I can't even think straight.. I've ALWAYS kept my pills on me for this very reason.  It's not even about the pills! We are all sleeping in the living room bc if they took 24 pills I don't want them sleeping alone. I'm so worried right now.. 

The pills are 10 mg oxymorphone (opana) ER

I’m very psychologically addicted to opiates.

 It started when I was 17 and tried Oxy. Well a year later I found an old Hydrocodone bottle in a cabinet and started taking them. I loved the feeling. I have been battling severe depression for a long time And this just made it that much worse. So naturally, I wanted the hydros. I tried to stop but after a while I went back to them and started mixing them with codeine. 

I’m afraid for my life. I have been thinking about them 24/7. Literally. I think about stealing them. I think about finding a plug. I research them in my free time. Is this normal? I didn’t think so. Pls give me advice.

Your first question is “Did he look like a leprechaun?” and the answer is YES. He stood about 5’6”, so he was short and stocky. He bathed infrequently, and he wore the same stinky overalls day after day, occasionally changing his T\-shirt.  Like a leprechaun, Lep had a scraggly red beard, a holdover from slave days. Most importantly, Lep loved gold in whatever form and HE WAS EVIL. He had absolutely no remorse and would chalk up his evilness to “THE GAME”.

Lep had just been released from prison after serving 30\+ years for murder. I didn’t ask the particulars; I didn’t want to know. Consequently, Lep had that hair\-trigger temper that men develop in prison. A joke instantly became an attack on his manhood and you felt that violence was simmering just below the surface, ready to explode. Worse still, Lep always had a weapon. His favorite was a knife, but he had no qualms about smashing your face with a bottle or whatever else was handy. He also had an old piece of shit 25 auto from Charter Arms or Raven Arms or one of those bottom tier gun makers. The thing would jam every third shot and was just as likely to hurt the shooter as the shootee.  Webster should show a picture of Lep’s gun in their listing for Saturday Night Special. And to top it all off, Lep was the most racist man that I’ve ever met. He hated all white people just because they were white.

A leprechaun must have his pot of gold and Lep’s gold was crack. Disregarding quality, Lep was an awesome dealer. For example, he would deliver 24x7, he was on\-time and his bags were heavy. The quality was crap, but he would use coca cola to “brown” his crack and vinegar to “smell” his H.  Lep’s dirtiest trick was to give\-out samples of the good stuff and once the customer was on a run and desperate for a hit, Lep would sell them the crappy stuff.

The Meloxicam does nothing but give me a migraine. Problem is, I've been going to the er and urgent care so much for pain I've been flagged I think. I prefer not to have norcos or perks because the withdrawal is to strong for me. I have to much shit to do and can't afford getting drowsy and irritable.

I'll start two weeks ago. After making a very stupid mistake I was arrested for a DUI, BAC was only .09, but that's beyond the point. In the county I live in suboxone isn't allowed in jails, so those addicted to opiates and/or Suboxone/methadone are forced to go cold turkey, which seems to be an incredible violation of our human rights, namely under the 8th amendment, but I regress. I've been on suboxone maintenance for a little over 2 years without a single relapse( I know, I'm a badass).10 days ago, knowing I have to check into jail(15 days out), I started a Suboxone quick taper in an attempt to avoid going through withdrawals in a damn jail cell. For those of you who've tried this you'll understand how painful this process is. BUT, my doctor also has me on gabapentin for anxiety due to a heart issue. Let me just say this drug Is a godsend. I'm on day 8 of my taper from 6 mg a day(day 1)down to .25 mg a day(today), that's a massive dose differential for such a short period. By taking my gabapentin as prescribed(600 mg morning, 300 mg mid day, 600 mg night) I HAVE COMPLETELY AVOIDED ANY WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, save a little diarrhea, which isn't a problem at all when you're used to RLS, sleeplessness and vomiting. In fact,  I feel like a million bucks today. There's a chance I'll still feel some withdrawal symptoms after completely stopping my subs, but I know it won't be anything compared to 6mg a day withdrawal. My hope is someone in a similar situation will read this and realize that that old bottle of Gabapentin in their sock drawer could save their life. To add, gabapentin IS allowed in my jail and I assume most if not all others in the U.S. as it isn't even scheduled nor a narcotic. I'm very sorry for the long read, I realize most of you won't make it to this part, but I feel so good right now I could write a few novels no problem haha.

Today we launch our first  report, in which we analyze the presence of fentanyl derivatives in  samples of heroin delivered from cryptomarkets to the International Drug  Checking Service from June 2014 to March 2018.  [https://energycontrol\-international.org/first\-ec\-international\-report\-heroin\-adulterated\-with\-fentanyl\-derivatives\-in\-cryptomarkets](https://energycontrol-international.org/first-ec-international-report-heroin-adulterated-with-fentanyl-derivatives-in-cryptomarkets)

According to our results:

“It  has been argued that cryptomarkets are perceived as “safer” \(higher  purities, less adulterants\) sources for illegal drugs. Nevertheless,  according to our data, heroin is a noticeable exception the average  purity of heroin purchased in cryptomarkets has a wide variability. We  have detected different fentanylanalogues in 11 samples purchased in  cryptomarkets, 10 of which were purchased from European vendors. We  think this situation can potentially lead to severe public health  problems. We discuss this hypothesis and its limitations in this report,  and we suggest possible actions to face this hazard.”

We are discussing these days how to face this problem, so stay tuned for more news.

There were like five geese and four of the ugliest chickens I've ever seen (my host said they're guineas). I don't know which were louder. Fuck it, I get up.

After what breakfast I could stomach, I thought I might go into the garage and smoke a cigarette. Nope, little ducks live in there, in something called a brooder. Oh, and I was told there is no smoking anywhere near the birds, something about a delicate respiratory system (canary in the mine). Well, the entire house/yard/fucking compound is dedicated to these birds, so I have to exit the yard and walk out to the road/vehicle path for a smoke. Fine.

That stupid fucking goose and his ugly ass chicken friends follow me the entire time, goose trying to bite, ugly chicken screeching. At least I made it out, but I'm really not up to running away from it.

I thought an attempt at a nap would be in order, but no, said the ugly chickens. I asked my friend about them, and she said the loud one is named Pancake.

The long path ahead of me was dimly lit but I was walking fast. “Fate is just a word people use to brainwash others” but I was following a dream. I dreamt of a world without pain, where the rain was cool but didn’t make me sick. Where the weeks were short and we all met up for coffee once in a while. But I wasn’t ever sure who I meant to meet up with, and for all the hassle, it wasn’t worth it. 

So, I drove a lonely road, no headlights to lead the path. I dreamt a lonely dream where the sickness had grown from inside me. And I died a lonely death, one that forever will haunt me because only I can change my world, yet you did everything to save it. So, I gasped a breath of fresh air, only because you allowed it. I screamed at the pain of the Narcan in my body, flowing freshly down me like a wave of pain. You didn’t know where to put it. But there on my bicep and thigh were two perfectly placed marks signifying the desperate efforts that were made only at your expense. You were never asked into this life, and no matter how vigorously I tried to shake you off, you never backed down. And so instead of loneliness, I have a guardian angel walking beside me. Instead of darkness and soulless searching, I had the ability to fill my lungs and scream that I am alive and only through your actions I am free. 

Because of this I’m ashamed that I’m not a better human, I’m ashamed that I even tried to drive that lonely path with no one to guide me. I’m ashamed that I didn’t even bother to leave the headlights on, because sometimes the dark is more comforting. It all changed like the dawn of a new sun, I've struggled but managed to hold onto you and remember that this life isn’t meant to be driven alone. I believe that only so many dreams can get granted, and maybe I will never be able to change. I just hope that you can love me where I am.

It's where you've been going this whole time. Day one, I knew, follow the road and road one goes straight through... just like I planned. Use opiates until the day I die and until then, simply skate by. 

Road 2: I'll be flipping entirely around, not exactly sure where I will end up. What's down this path that makes it special is the man I love. This path includes sobriety. I have always, deep down under the feelings I suppress with opiates, I've truly always known that what happiness would TRULY be for me is being sober and happy with the man I love and a dog. 

Well, I got lucky. Oh I got so fucking lucky guys. I found the man of my dreams, and I could not be happier. He lives a few states away and he wants to help me get sober if it's what I want. He isn't pressuring me. But he has offered to help anyway he can. Preparing for the move, he's stocked on Kratom. He also told me he will wait until I am ready.... but moving in with him and the help of Kratom that I know works for me... maybe I can do this. I'm already trying to taper down and do my best.

I'm going fo take Road 2. I want to be with the man that loves me. And hopefully being in a brand new environment where I don't know anyone really except for the man I love and his family, with his support and my wanting to truly be sober with a happy family someday day... I think I can really do this. And I am so lucky to have met such a supportive man to love me back.

8frmqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8frmqw/worried_about_creeping_tolerance/,8,https://redd.it/8frmqw,mister_kali,Worried about creeping tolerance.,"Some background: I had been dealing with chronic pain for a year, taking hydrocodone 5/325 as needed to deal with the pain. Disliked the high (smoke a lot of pot, do LSD now and then, Coke, once in a blue moon, K a few times, DMT twice  – no stranger to drugs) so strictly used for pain, which worked out to be 10mg once/twice a week for over a year. Never strayed from this dose since use was rarely more than a day in length and relied more heavily on CBD which was great. 

Just had hip surgery and then averaged about 30-40mg/daily of Oxy to deal with pain over a week while recovering. 

I had a small accident last night and I’m in bad pain again. I took 10mg in the middle of the night but felt that it took only about 30% of the edge off, so took another 5mg which was enough to help me be comfortable (felt more like 20mg would have been ideal).

Note that I am not expecting needing to use any pain killers long term – once I get out of the post-op period I shouldn’t have pain anymore.  

Two questions for you guys as I’m concerned with the creeping tolerance. 


- Is 15/20mg tolerance for PAIN (not to get high/nod) concerning here? Prior to hurting myself last night, I had only taken two doses over two days, and went the day prior without any and felt no ill effects. I didn’t need them at all yesterday until I got hurt. I am hoping this isn’t a serious setback and should only require 24-48hr. of maintenance. 


- Related to the above, at what point will I potentially experience withdrawal effects?


TLDR - chronic pain, used 10mg hydro about once a week to manage, tolerance never crept above that. Had surgery, a lot of pain, up to needing 15mg/20mg per dose for relief. Worried about this.",1525011909.0

He pulls to the side at the stop sign and lets me pass him and he follows  me, which I assumed. I always follow all traffic laws and we hit the main road and he follows me for almost a mile, theres now a cop in front of who the other cop on my rear must of radioed (were a bunch of parties in that neighborhood according to them, which is very likely for the area, time of year and location.) Next thing I know I got red and blues behind me and I pull over, we are actually sitting across from the police station now.

Time to mention I have 45 norco on me, and weed in several bags/containers as well at $569. I do have my med card and it was in my lock box in my trunk so that was an issue, what was an issue was my money was split into a $100 in 5 $20s on my oassanger seat as i jist flipped some pinetrees, $175 in another pile and the rest in  another. Also, the one fucking day I forgot my wallet was today.

Long story short, they definetly thought my money was fishy being 20 and it being being split around, I'm a professional lier and pulled this off very well. They first arrested me right away for driving without a liscene but told me im not neccasarily going to jail and put me between my car and one of the 2 officers, they just needed to figure out   who I was.

While between the cars they ask if I have anything illegal in the car, I then notify I have my weed and lockbox in my trunk but I'm a med card holder  and thankfully I keeo my soft copy (doctors paper work etc) in my lockbox.  I brought my lockbox with me today for the first time in months because my mom mentioned I should with how dank the bud is.(good looks on that mah)

They ask if anything else is in the car and I tell them as far as I know nope, norcos were just tossed under my front seat as i had 2 cops on me so I wasnt gonna try to turn or do any fast movements. Then they put me in the back of squad car for a few and go to get my info to see if i'm telling the truth. They've been chill with me this whole time, respectful not dickheads.

Anyways they eventually go to search my car, a few minutes kater I see the script in his hand and hes twirling it and walking around the car to me, opens the door and asks what they are, I don't deny it, tell him they're norco. He's still chill asked again if I have anything on me etc and I didn't he said we can atrip searfh you at the station and I told him no problem with that I have nothing more.

They pop the trunk, see my papers  in rhe lockbox, call their boss to make sure the soft copy waa good and left the weed there, boss saod as long as I have the doctor papers I'm good to go. Then we drive across the street to the cop shop, do booking, inventory my money and then go to a holding cell, single cell, bed toilet sink and blanket, waa geeked to have a blanket because the city over where I live didnt give me one when I was 16 and took my hoody, was cold as fuck.

At this point my charges are driving witbout a Liscenes on person and for the norco possesion if a deadly substance or drug, I cant remember the end and am to lazy to go get my paper work on the floor on the end of my bed. 

 They thankfully made the norco charge a misdemenor but could have easily made it a felony but I was chill with them, took 50mg (usually take like 150 but didnt get home to cwe the rest) so I was atleast chilled out a bit.   

Long story short, I have $569 on me and my total bond one was $200 cash the other $400, so I had to call my  mom at like 330am no clue, didnt have my glasses or a clock. Got out of there like 445am. As im getting out and getting my stuff, I notice one of the desk cops was a girl I went to school with (class of 2016) so I don't know if that helped but me and her were chill back on the day had several classes together etc.

I'm just pissed that theyre going to want me to do drug court probably, which ismt fucking cheep. Lost my reup money too bond, I'm gettimg a lawyer even thoigh its my first case. Im 99% sure the Liscene charge will get dropped but I don't feel having to do some bull shit probabtion, I swear everytime my life is going up bullshit has to happen.",1525006137.0

Any tips?

I have the syringe filled, originally it was around 40ml of water but now it's about 25ml, guess the rest evaporated while I let the spoon sit (like it sit for 15 minutes on a large spoon so lots of surface area), or didn't make it through the filter.

I put around 3mg of buprenorphine from the white subutex pill in cold water on the spoon, most of it dissolved and I crushed the rest with the plunger of the syringe until it dissolved. Filtered it twice through a clean, unused cigarette filter butt (the cotton used in cigarette butts seems superior to cotton anyways - bleached, which prevents cotton fever aka LPS/endotoxin shock, and acetylated into cellulose acetate, the way it's processed makes it filter a lot better, much smaller pore size).

I accidentally brushed the tip of the needle against the very rough metal spoon while drawing up the solution, do you think that'll do anything bad?

The Subutex pill's ingredients seem pretty safe when injected, much safer than MS/oxy pills, the only two harmful ones seem to be magnesium stearate and the other one I'll get the exact name of in a sec. Who has shot pills here before and wants to tell me about it? The solution is a little cloudy after two filtrations so idk. 

**TL;DR** The very obvious vein in the crook of my elbow is the one to hit, right? Just wanna make sure 100% before doing it. I do not want to hit an artery, and don't want put myself in the hospital somehow.

I told him I have alot of trouble peeing essentially everyday but weirdly im really confident that its not something physical / too worrysome. Basically after I told him my circumstances he confirmed my suspicions. Its a very common things and its all psychiatric. in order to pee I need zero human contact, I FOR SURE need to know theres no one waiting on me, I need to be in an empty bathroom that I know will stay empty if its in public, if im stressed or anxious about anything in life \- the peeing just aint happening. Opiates or not, putting my hands in warm or cold water never seemed to do anything for me. Even when I was very young. When a good enough dose of opiates is in the mix to where im feeling good \(not even a nod dose\) \- theres a real fucking problem LOL. I didnt realize opiates give a lot of people basically a textbook case of a shy bladder for the duration of the effects, until my first time having to go pee on a nice dose and struggling so bad that after, without exaggeration, 45 minutes I gave up. I specifically gave myself that long cause I wanted to pee to make my high feel better but I wasnt gonna waste too much high time. Last night I spent 35 minutes on the toilet, alternating between sitting and standing many many time, pressing hard on my own bladder trying to express the urine like a paralyzed dog, and eventually I accomplished my first opiate urination. The pee would come out in sync with my breathe, while breathing in it stopped. while peeing it felt like it was being squeezed through a fucking pinhole. I didnt get done peeing actually, but it was like my mind said ""Alright you got enough out to where the feeling of having to pee wont be present anymore. Go enjoy your high."". I must say, Im pretty certain that pressing on my own bladder eventually did help lots. Just wanted to share with you guys my little life story about urination, how the psyche plays a role in it, and how the whole process is greatly affected specifically by the drug family known as opiates ;\) ",1524974836.0

The girl who introduced me (unknowingly) to the middle I've been dealing with gave me the number of one of her other dudes who is a direct guy; no middling; awesome right ? Well see. 

I talked to the guy at 10:28pm and he told me where to meet him but he was doing something so he'd hit me back in 20 min. Went to the area and have been chillin across the street. Sent him a text to hit me up when he was ready cuz I was in the area, he said absolutely. Awesome. 

After another 30 min I text asking for an eta, no response after 10 min so I call. He says his phone was dead and he's charging it so should be 5-10 more min, supposedly lives right behind this mcdonalds. Cool I guess even though it's been over an hour. I tell him I'll be in the lot then. 

Just got another text sayin eta is 15 min. 

Obviously I'm aware of the ol 20 mins bein 40 mins and what not but with my streak of fakes and bullshit I'm a lil nervous. 

Naturally I had 2 blues left that I took the minute I talked to dude the first Time and now I can't even enjoy em cuz I'm a ball of nerves. 

Everyone please send some well wishes my way as I wait and wait and wait that this will actually come through. 



EDIT/UPDATE: 

Turns out this ""straight connect"" is not; in fact he is another middle. This sucks because I have about 3 middles at this point and obv all I want is a straight up fucking connect; better than nothing at all though. 

Dude shows up with his dude (almost 3 hours after the first 20min) and main guy walks into wawa and other dude jumps in my car askin for the cash; hell no. He obv sees my hesitation and says I can walk in with him; obv I do. 

Guy gets his soda, has my money, pays for his drink with one of the five dollar bills I had given him. We go back outside and he says he'll jump in my car in a second; I'm immediately like god fucking damnit, dudes about to try some shit, so I back up an essentially block in his car. 

I'm watching them do the transfer and finally middle dude jumps in my car. Counts out 6 for me and he has 1 for himself. (I hadn't previously asked the price , just assumed $30 because that's what I've been paying out here) this makes me feel better because they look good and he obviously took the profits from middling the deal and got himself one. (I'm assuming they were $25, and by myself assuming $30, he was able to cop one for himself and grab a soda) 

This I honestly don't care about because he's a fucking middle; of course there's gonna be a fee. No one middles for free, I mean why would they ? I've never muddled for free, that's for damn sure. 

Anyways I'm sorry , I'm high (yay :) ) and for some reason since I've actually started posting lately instead of just lurking it somehow turns into a fucking novel. Thanks for reading this long as fuck shit post :) 

TL;DR : thought I found a new connect , turned out to be a middle , waited around for literally 3 hours being told throughout it would be 5, 15, 20 mins etc BUT successfully copped 6 blues :) already ate 2 and have 4 for tomorrow

I have been in therapy, and I have been taking all different kinds of anti-depressants and shit. Like you many of you guys, I use drugs to self medicate.

The meds arent helping, and my doctor is constantly changing them and increasing the doses, which make me feel like shit. They have completely destroyed my sex drive. I've always had a very *healthy* sex drive, and now I could care less if I ever see another dick or a pair of tits. Since Ive stopped the stims, Ive gained weight, which I absolutely *hate*. I was a size 0 for years, and now I feel disgusting. Honestly, this is the longest period of sobriety I've had since I was 15 (I'm in my 40's now) and I'm starting to hate it.

I was honest with my PM specialist and told her that I’ve been taking at least 250mg extra a day to manage the pain.  We went to short scripting (my idea) every 7 days I pick up a week’s worth of tram 400mg/day in addition to 5mg oxy 2/day for breakthrough pain. 

I still failed with 2 days short of my refill today. So that amount only lasts me about 5 days—and I’m still taking over max dose.

I told her I didn’t want to go back up to oxy, but I need to. How do I explain that I need a stronger medication for 2 more months to help me get through work? I’m done with work at the end of June. After that, I want to detox and try CBD (no pills). I have about 2 months to play with that before I have to go back to work.

The signs of OD are: shallow, gurgling, snoring breath, not breathing, not responding, cool clammy skin, turning blue. Also, check if nodded off. If you can't wake someone up after calling their name and doing a hard sternum rub with the knuckles, it's time for 911 ""Someone's not breathing"", rescue breathing \(no chest compressions\), and the naloxone. With the amount of fentanyl everywhere now, it's good to think about an emergency plan. 

Arizona residents can get FREE naloxone by requesting at [spwaz.org](https://spwaz.org). There's a standing order Rx for naloxone for every resident in AZ. It's covered by most insurance, including ACCCHS and you should be able to pick it up at Walgreens or CVS.

I was wondering can you take dihydrocodeine and codeine together or is it a waste. 

What if, for example you were using codeine - a nice 400mg dose and wanted to top it up with a few Paramols which contain Dihydrocodeine. 

Or what even a good dose of both?

Turns out the ER doctor straight up lied to me. I went to see my pain specialist yesterday morning and he said he never denied me access to care in the ER. He said he received an angry call from the ER doctor telling him he shouldn't be prescribing me anything and that I was in there faking my illness. 

So apparently the whole, ""you're under pain management and your new contract for all his patient's states emergency care is off the table"" rant by the ER doctor was an entire lie.

Someone who had seen me for less than 5 minutes made the determination I was lying and then called my regular doctors to tell them I was in there lying. Apparently, according to my pain specialist, he doesn't recommend I ever go back to that hospital again because the note is so severe he doesn't think I'll ever get adequate treatment again. 

I've been treated at this hospital for almost 10 years now.

I have been dabbling in drugs for the past couple years, I have tried (in order of use frequency) weed, speed, benzos, acid, vics, dmt, mdma, cocaine, shrooms, meth, methadone and an oxy. Almost got addicted to stims, but managed to quit as soon as I saw the glimpse of the hole that was just beneath my feet.


In the past 9 months or so I haven't used pretty much at all except maybe weed a couple times a week, benzos and vics once in a while.


So a couple weeks ago I got my hands on a bunch of xans and my barred out retarded self decided to order a gram of heroin because hey oxies and heroin are basically the same thing except one is much cheaper right?


So it arrives and as soon as I took a good look at the baggie I got this intense feeling of fear like something really bad is about to happen and I decided to put it away and sleep on it.


The baggie is sitting on my shelf right now. I pick it up once in a while, look at it, feel it, smell it, and put it back down. I can't stop thinking about it. I want to snort a tiny bit and see how it feels. I want to flush it down the drain, but I spent good money on it. I have good friends who have been struggling with addiction for years and read many stories on Reddit and many other sites.


I apologise for this weird post but I just want to get this off my mind and hopefully have someone give me their perspective.

But say you don't have the strips on hand, you've gotten your baggie from a popular vendor with great reviews and supposedly never cuts (I know I know, you can't fully trust a stranger online but just take this into consideration), and you're itching to spend your Saturday nodding out while watching documentaries, playing video games, or whatever you fancy.

Now for my *theoretical* question: Say there was accidentally a tiny bit of fent/fentalog in your bag you believed was pure H and you consumed a tiny *tiny* spec up your nose, would you automatically *fatally* overdose if you were snorting really small bumps (like pencil tip bumps)? Or would you just get a quick and sudden nod?

I've seen this forum really make a change in people's lives. You've saved and condemned, gave advice and given harsh criticism. That's what us dopers are great at. Judging without truly judging. 

I just wanted to say that I think we should take a few steps back (I'm guilty of judging too) and really ask ourselves ""what are we here for?"" To just compare dope porn? To give advice? 

First and foremost we should be here for harm reduction. I've gotten into a few arguments here as of late and it bothers me. I know it's my fault for responding with anger but I wanna ask this of all of you, of us, 

If we don't take care of each other who will? Society already hates us. Let's try to act with a little more love and a little less judgements.

First and foremost, in case any of you are in a ""struggle"", or you're feeling down or ANYTHING, I just want to let you know that you truly are a beautiful being. People are people, and we have all made mistakes that we wish we could take back - that doesn't take away how special you really are!

But you really have to think of your life as a book. Your life is YOUR book, it's made specifically and only for you. And whoever you may be jealous of at the time, someone you went to school with or whoever you think has it better than you or doing better, they are not the hero of your book!

You know who the hero of your book is??...It's you!

 You're all smart - like come on how many clever ways have we all concocted to get high haha! Feel free to comment some funny/desperate cop stories - I enjoy reading those, but I digress.

I am incredibly happy right now and I hope you all are doing well. If you aren't doing well, talk to me honestly! I'm so good at talking with people and I'm so A-OK with being there for anyone - listen to me, I will be your friend. I haven't used in about 1.5 months. I had my last University class today and it was very emotional tbh, and I'm just so happy I finally graduated and I can now get my big boy job started and begin racking in huge amounts of money as I have minimal loans because I worked throughout school. I did however pickup some roxy's 60 15mg! My tolerance is so low it's blown me out the water and I forgot how much euphoria you get from these because I've been doing oxymorphone but man oh man do I fucking love me a roxy. Earlier I did 1 15mg and yaked like instantly haha! but it felt soooo good ugh. Currently on 45mg roxy, 1mg xan, drinking some michelob ultra and I am figgity figgity fucked up and havent felt like this in soooo long ugh! It's so nice.

Love you guys, I hope you all have good things coming your way - and I promise you they are, I promise! If you're down, keep your head up - because you're all strong people. 

PEACE OUT,

K

Soon. I miss her love, her cold embrace, the thing that tells me I'm okay and I love her. I just never want to feel love again. I'd trade the emotions I feel for a quick escape; any day of the week.

I miss not caring for anyone else but it makes me anguish for those I love.

I'm ready to take a rest now, and sleep until I hear my final breath.

Let this fire finally go out, I'm ready to move on, I need to be free. But I want to be caged.

I abused weed for 5 years straight everyday non stop chronic smoking, blunts, bongs, pipes, joints. I wish I can go back and save my lungs from the emphysema I have now, and my damaged heart that gets poor oxygen now. Just when life was getting better and I got my Weedtube channel up on YouTube, a trip to the ER and the results shattered my world. I can no longer smoke as much for my subscribers and I am very depressed and broken right now. I ruined my health because I wanted to feel better in life because I loved life, but all that abuse only shortened my dear life. Please remember guys that opiates can destroy your heart muscle and worst, you may never wake again from too much of the escape you want. If you guys would like to check out my channel it’s the same as my user on here. One life to live and one body only to use. Peace everyone, take care 

Add on: 
I’ve had my share of abusing opioids and benzos I’m ashamed of that I didn’t mention. My heart stopped beating one time when I had a period of abusing Xanax. One night I took a total of ten 2mg Xanax and I was out cold and didn’t respond to anyone. I was told by paramedics that my blood toxicity level was so high that my heart shut down, that definitely damaged my heart. All this happened one year ago January 2017 and since that day I’ve had shortness of breath and irregular heart palpitations. Before the issue with benzos I only used cannabis and dropped lsd twice. I started with opiates in September 2016 and I fell in love with oxy. My first time taking oxy it was great, until I foolishly took another 30mg after my first dose of 15mg, so dumb and if I get hate for it I deserve it. But that overdose was a life death experience for me, I kept nodding but it was a painful nod, my heart struggled to beat to stay alive, I was able to feel how slow it was beating and I had to keep myself awake or I knew i was going to die. Everytime I puked my vision got more yellow and yellow like a camera filter. No doubt, all these drugs have taken a toll on my life. I’ve been very emotional and I just want everyone to take care of themselves. Once your two pretty important organs of the lungs and heart doesn’t function to 100% does one realize that it’s too late. No one really expects Asians to have these types of problems but everyone of all types lives unique lives. So please, my friends, I wish you all good health and care. Live wisely so you don’t have to struggle with health. Everyone is living to die, but don’t make it a struggle to survive with a few bad choices. 💟☮️☯️",1524885385.0

1) i did really high dose but i didnt feel warm body, this beautiful codeine feeling, i felt weird with being on quite different high.
2) it wasnt very strong at all, i had problems reading and writing while opening both eyes 

what i did wrong, i crushed the 3/4 of pill and tried to safely take it, it was a nice experience but i wanted more from such a potent opiate, eh

should i do it only orally/only sniff? in one dose?

Not a frequent user of anything other than weed and alcohol, but a friend cleaned out her medicine cabinet and gave me some hydrocodone and codeine in a few forms. Only problem is that I don't think I have enough of any particular variety to get anywhere, so I'm looking at how to mix them safely. 

I tried using the conversion charts and whatnot in the sidebar but I couldn't quite figure it out. I know from previous experiences with hydros that about 10\-15mg of hydrocodone was a good dose for me so I was trying to find an equivalent amount of codeine.

Currently, I have:

1. One 5mg hydrocodone
2. 5x15mg Codeine and Acetaminophen pills
3. 75ml of Codeine/promethazine cough syrup. If I'm reading the label correctly, it's 10mg per 5ml.

I have tried the codeine pills before, and even taking 5 of them I didn't feel much, and from past experience I know that a single hydro won't get me very far.

Through The Looking Glass is a very rare and (previously) hard to find LP released in 1983 by the experimental Japanese percussionist Midori Takada. Due to a low number of original presses of the LP, and no rereleases on tape, CD, or in digital format drove the cost of a good condition original vinyl LP up to over $1,000. Thanks to a reissue in the last year or so, the average John and Jane Q. Public can own a new LP of this incredible masterpiece for a reasonable price.

It's definitely abstract, and borders on avante garde, but if you have 45 minutes to sit still in a comfortable chair and listen to the the entirety of the album with a solid nod then I highly recommend it. Luckily some kind soul has uploaded a vinyl rip to Youtube, so all people can experience what is one of the best albums I have heard in recent memory. ",1524866028.0

My issue i received no pain medication ant the doctor doesn't feel comfortable writing scripts to someone my age (20) without the MRI to back it up my apt is on the 2nd. I don't mean to complain but until a little after the results of the MRI show I may get something but this waiting is absolute hell I'm treating my family like shit and I've been up for the past 36 hours because of the spasms I get in my back. im really sorry for ranting  but I took the last of my two norcos I bought but im  broke till the 3rd. so send me all your thoughts and prayers so I can make it till then. 

  (Ps has anyone gone through something similar to this with an chipped l5 pressing against the l4 and possibly s1.

So my dude was gonna see his people yesterday and try and make everything right. At this point he had given me 2 legit ones over 2 days (this happened Monday night-the fakes). I text dude around 3 yesterday and he's in the city at a doc appt and says he's meeting with his people up there and will hit me back once he's back in town; all good. 

I'm at work and it's about 830pm with no word from him so I step outside for a quick smoke and decide to call him. Dude picks up and says he's got good news & bad news. Good news is he got a little of his money back and got some new ones. Bad news is he can only give me 1/2 my money back cuz he lost 1/2 his. I tell him no prob I understand (I'm happy to get anything back at this point). I say since I technically still owe him for the 1 from the other day just give me 2 of the blues and I'll buy 2 and well call it a day. He's cool with this and says he'll meet me at my job when I'm off (another girl I work with gets shit from him too). 

Dude shows up but were still workin so I grab her cash and run out real quick. Obviously it's dark out when I get into his car and I see an Oxy 10 (pink) sitting on his middle consule and immediately I'm relieved because even if the blues are fakes no one presses 10s right ?! Dead fuckin wrong.

Of course I don't know this yet, I don't take time to look at the 10s because clearly I'm a fuckin idiot and immediately buy 7. Dude then hands me 2 of the 30s he owes me, and this time I look at them. Halfway decent looking m boxes but obv fakes. I knew when I looked at them something was off. Overall the press was impressive (haha) it had a shine/sheen (?) to it but I've don't plenty of m boxes in my day and they've always been more chalky. I take the 2 on the off chance they're real by some jj miracle but tell him I don't think they're legit but I'll double check just to be sure. Get the other girl hers and go back into work. 

I tell the girl I don't think these are legit but I could be wrong and she says oh fuck this were gonna find out right now (she snorts, I eat, so she goes into the bathroom ) 

She comes out heated af, fuckin fakes again. I go into the bathroom and decide to look at the 10s, they don't look right big seriously who in tf spends the time and energy to fake 10s?! Someone apparently because as soon as I put them in my mouth and chew I know these are fakes. I'm beyond fuckin livid, I gotta give this girl a ride home and she calls dude and bitches him out. I text him asking to meet after I drop her off, he says to call him. 

I drop this girl off and call dude, he's 30 mins away but will come return my money when he's back. In the mean time I try one person who I've dealt with a few times here they just never ever answer (older lady-story for another day) naturally ive tried calling her already multiple times today because at this point I only wanna deal with her (her shit has been on point everytime ) of course this time , while I'm waiting on a refund she answers and says she had a few left but I gotta get there within the hour, of course I say no prob because I want those last ones. 

At this point I'm freaking out, I can get some but I need my money because obv I just spent it all again. 

I call dude and explain I found some real ones, and she's out in the area he's in and wonder if I can come meet him. He's not thrilled but says I can meet him out that way, just not where he is. 

I drive out and call him about 6x and he's obviously annoyed but I apologize and say I'm just freaking out, I'm starting to withdrawl and I need to get moving. 

This has turned into a longer story than I intended lol but anyways dude actually shows up and gives me $100 total. $60 refund on the 2 blues, I had previously gotten 2 30mg Addie's which ran me $30, tried to 'return' those but he said just keep em and gave me an additional $30 and I just straight up asked him to borrow $10 cuz that would get me what I need and he does. And on top of this his ACTUAL script of 5s, he had 7 left and just gave them to me.

All in all I'm still out some money but dude did help me out in returning my shit last night and not givin me the run around. I honestly kinda feel bad for the dude gettin screwed 2x but he obv doesn't know enough about this because he doesn't do em. ",1524842653.0

Fucked it all up last week over some dumb shit—literally my favourite 24 hour diner closed at like 2AM for a computer system upgrade or something—and I just kinda lost it over not being able to chill at my usual spot after work (I’m a server elsewhere) and went home and hit the tin foil like the piece of shit human I am.

Even though my problem is really not all that bad quite yet at the moment, I’ve done this enough to know what happens next and I really don’t want it to get there. I know that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results, and that’s kinda what it feels like tryna stay clean on my own.

So like a dumbass I called my doctors office and said I wanted to make an appointment cause I need help with my drug problem. I never wanted any of this bullshit to be in my medical records or what have you but I’m at a point where I’m just so sick of this bullshit, maybe getting outside help is worth a shot. The appointment is tomorrow and I’m really regretting having made it. I only have health insurance for another month or so as well because my 26th birthday is pretty soon.

Was I being stupid having made such an appointment? Should I bail and not go? What is my doctor even gonna make me do? Am I gonna have to take a drug test and if so will they make me go to rehab? Cause I don’t think that’s nescessary. I can get clean whenever I want, I just need to figure out how to stay clean. It’s just a really frustrating situation, given that I’ve generally been a very functional addict. Tbh it’s the mental side of all this that’s really been wearing me down lately.

Anyone relate?",1524817322.0

I waited 4 hours in the ER waiting room followed by 1hour in the back in the worst pain I've had in a long time now. I had vomited  roughly 6 times in a 3 hour period and was beyond shaky/ill. Quite frankly I'm still ill. 

Finally, I'm seen by an ER doctor who says he needs to talk to my new pain management specialist before he'll administer any pain medication. An hour goes by and I've left two voicemails myself for this specialist and haven't heard back another hour goes by still nothing I leave another voicemail. Then 30 minutes go by and the ER doctor comes in to tell me that my pain specialist is denying me access to care in the ER. I sob quietly and squirm. I'm in the worst pain of my life and things have just gotten worse because I can't get any relief. I leave another 2 voicemails for my doctor - still no reponse.

So, I call and try to get through to one of his associates who is quite rude to me. I explain the situation and he was like ""what do you want me to do about it? You're already at the ER."" I ask him to clarify my contract for me, afterall, there in the same clinic and he flat out tells me he wont do that and was very condescending.

I cry. 

I ask to be discharged. They take over an hour getting me discharged. I cry more. I get home, sleep for 45 minutes and now I'm up in tears and pain and oh so angry. 

I didnt ask for this. I didn't ask to get sick. I didn't ask to require aroud the clock pain medication. I didn't ask to go to the ER. I don't abuse my situation - at least I haven't in over 8 months. Right now I just want to die it's so bad.  IDK how I'm gonna make it till 8am to show up at his office early and get some answers, but I'm gonna have to. 

I don't want to do this anymore. I just don't. I can't die because I have family and a boyfriend. I can't do that to them, but goddamnit I'd be lying if I didn't say I genuinely don't feel lke living anymore.",1524816137.0

This is a post about whats happening to my mother and what if anything can be done... Basically she got hurt 20ish years ago and has been on multiple pain killers the whole time.. Her current is morphine 60mg/2x a day and percocet 10mg/3x a day. She went to the doctor a few days ago and the doctor said that the D.E.A is saying that people can only have 90mg a day of morphine and cut her down to 50mg/2x a day but with prior authorizations and such she has yet to be able to pick it up and not even sure if she will be able to period and she lives entirely on benefits. So my question to you guys is... Is this legit? Can the DEA say how much a person can have? She gets bad with drawls if she doesnt have the right amount of meds and now shes having to take more of the percocet since she does not have the morphine. Any help appreciated or if you guys need more info..


Doc said she needed an ER and an IR and now they have taken the ER away. (EDIT)",1524807792.0

I'm pretty sick of my son smoking pot in his bedroom all day and all night and I don't know why he can't just go to the shed or out back like a normal kid? And it's always the same excuse.

My daughter is a senior and I can't wait until she goes to college. All she does is play on her phone and roll her eyes at me. I don't even know what she does on her phone because I'm pretty sure she communicates in grunts and moans. I am pretty sure when she stomps her feet and slams my fucking doors she's upset though. I don't know if she's a work in progress or a product of my parenting. 

My oldest one is in college. He's definitely my favorite. He's the smart one. Always took his pot outside. Wasn't sneaky about it but didn't throw it in my face like his brother. Never had homemade bongs and popcan bowls strewn about his room or empty beer bottles. At this point he's getting everything when I die.
