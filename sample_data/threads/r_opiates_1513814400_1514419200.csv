So the driver and I get talking, sure enough she's an addict too. She tells me about a girl who's literally a three minute walk from me that never makes you wait, and doesn't cut her shit. I was down and cancelled on the other guy, within 10 minutes we'd picked up and I was back at my house with more than I paid for! It was great! I was truly blessed that day, I've grabbed off her everyday since and her shit is always awesome, and I've seen her grab it from her guy and literally take mine out and hand it to me. She weighs it infront of you so you know it's good, and she's honestly a great person. When I went to grab last night she could see I was sick (we played phone tag all day) and she invited me in & I hung out with her & her guy and got high for about an hour before going home.

The best part is how close she is, she has no minimum, she'll do a half point if you want her to, and she genuinely cares about the people she sells Tom She's not out to screw anyone over, she's just a really genuine person and so is her boyfriend. When I left last night she mentioned we needed to hang out again soon & I walked home happy that it was a stress free situation (the opposite of what it is with my other dealer).

If so, I'd suggest refraining every now and then. 

Why? Because of neurobiology, that's why. Specifically, your brain begins essentially to produce antidote to a drug before the time it usually experiences the drug. So if you eat a grapefruit 30 minutes before you take an oxy every time you eat a grapefruit and take an oxy, your brain knows 30 minutes ahead of time that you are going to take an oxy, and so it begins to work to counteract the effect. 

The idea here is to confuse your brain; to take away the normal course of events and do something unexpected, so that no molecules are floating around inside you that will prevent you from getting the full effects.",1513856998.0

At the end of the taper i still seem to relapse but it took me a few months where with ct about a month or less -_- 

When you hit 0mg however expect to feel lethargic, some anxiety & Insomnia. However nothing in comparison to cold turkey. If it's really bothering you I bought a valiums or long acting benzo ( just don't get addicted to these Aka only use for when wd is bad) and a nice indica strain of weed along with some days off work. That and going for a run or long brisk walk. Or gym if that's more your thing.

How long do you keep your suboxone under your tounge?

Do you know of any? Is there a set time for each dose if you know?

I know they say till it's dissolved. But for the 2mg I'm at right now I can't look under my tounge around 5 mins in as spit runs out. But when I have made the mistake I can still seem the Suboxone there. Somewhat dissolved of course.

All of it, I've been here!

That's why I wanna share this with you guys, even though the two are totally unrelated. One thing's for sure -- we all hate rude, inconsiderate bitches.

Ok so I'm in graduate school. We had a presentation for one class, where we broke off in groups.

OK so one had a suggestion to bring in stuff to pass out. I was very much against because in undergraduate the PHD-level instructor with decade-plus experience in media as a journalist told us to never pass anything out unless you're done with the speech. He followed that rule in class too.

One girl in group of 4 people total suggested bringing in mcdonalds for people -- speech about supply chain or something, in no way related to MCD's greasy quasi-goodness -- which I was against. 

So girl brings in MCD for the presentation, like a biiiiiig bag's worth of burgers or something. Not many people in our class of 10-13 people -- only half class there that day for speech -- even ate them. So there is a shit ton of these burgers left, that very few people ate. and hell I didn't even have any. 

At the end of the class, girl left them in hallway for others to eat. I dipped about 15 minutes after everybody left... burgers still sitting there... way over half the bag left. Like so wasteful, none of the people in the group had any utility for them.... Whatever.

In the class immediately following presentation, that girl asked me to contribute $5 to those burgers... Same day as speech -- not even asking me before hand, none of that. Just assuming I wanted to help out -- coming from the person who staunchly went against handing anything at all out before speeches in hopes of keeping their attention -- when... OK, we get how out of place her asking is.

Girl wasn't the most friendly person, even before asking me for the reimbursement. So, today, about 1.5 or 2 months after presentation date, I email her and ask how I can pay her back.

She suggests PayPal, I tell her I don't have it -- I do lol -- so I'm now asking for mailing address.

If I get that mailing address, guess what I already have folded up, return address'd up, stamp'd up, in an envelope?

So she looking semi-sober (I admit, I used the most of the substances and left her little being the greedy fuck I am) asks me to at least IV her with the spoon and cotton wash-out. And now, after the IV, she has been in total 20 minutes in this strange state - she's breathing, but she's at the same time convulsing a bit (that stopped after 10 minutes, now sleeping it off, as it seems). She can (could) answer certain questions with ""naay"" or ""yaay"" kind of sounds and showed some kind of cognition levels. I asked her if she felt bad and should I call the docs, but the answers sounded like ""no, don't, I'm ok"". I was quite certain, at least about the feeling not that bad part. She's was just rolling in my bed slowly t:+15mins - changing poses of her being rolled, lying straight and just looking and sounding like she's heavily sedated and just sleeping. And now after t:+20 mins of her last IV she's seems to be lying still, breathing irregularly, but the interval of breaths is good, they're often. Looking like a typical junkie that took a little much, but didn't OD.

When I see an OD I usually call the docs as soon as I can and therefore I've saved her and others many times. But this time I feel that this will pass as she breaths, she's doesn't look noticeably bluish or troubled breathing, she's just being really incomprehensive. 
Now she calmed down and seems to be snoozing it off. 

What do you think about her HARDCORE reaction to the spoon and cotton wash-offs? Substances: possible fent and IV methadon. They usually all start working as soon as you IV them as usually most of IV opiates do. So I've never seen anything like this in my 7 year IV h (and fent) addict.

EDIT: Sorry for the alarm. I woke her t:+30 mins after her last dose and she responded clearly (yet being still heavily sedated) that she's fine. Pheeew. I asked did she feel bad when those spasms happened and she slurred ""yes"" or something, but I think she didn't understand the question as her eyes were rolling in different directions. Put her back to sleep. Now she's a lot calmer, regular deep breaths. And part of cognition seems to have returned. WTF, all that from a washed spoon and cotton, a piece of it!",1513808110.0

But I feel my heart beating weird which makes me more paranoid etc. etc...

This actually happened to me with weed too (well not that I would OD, but I would start getting crazy anxious) about the same amount of time after I was heavily smoking. That also started out of nowhere until I just quit weed.

In a perfect world, I would be comfortable with getting clean and just quit dope. But, unfortunately, right now I don't feel like I can.

I shot from the crook of the arm upwards and must've slipped out of the vein. Of course I don't feel much yet bc the Cocaine acts as a local anesthetic.



I already put heparin ointment on it, a cool pack that I removed after reading that heat should be applied. So, anyone around who has handled this situation successfully in the past or knows how to do that? Is it better to warm up and open the the vessels or cool down and contain the missed shot in a small area? What would prevent an abcess?

We've been partying and experiencing new things together for years. Yes we enable each other but none is anymore responsible than the other. We're both almost 30 years old and have been responsibly having fun for a long time. 

Well recently he split with his girl and had to stay with his mom for a while. His mom finds out he gets high and instantly blames me even though she's been my second mother most of my life. So she kicks him out and he goes to stay with his sister 3 hours away. His sister is a good 4 years younger than him. Well a few days ago they somehow found a couple of his pills and flipped out. They took his phone and went through all of his texts and also hacked his Facebook. They search him every time he walks in the house. Hell they even search him before they'll let him in the car. It's insane. 

Then they called his mom and she goes crazy and called the sheriffs department on me and gave them all of my info and told them that I'm a major drug dealer and I'm ruining her sons life. Funny thing is, when we started doing opiates, HE is the one who found pills first and HE is the one who introduced me to the dope man. He's tried to tell them this but they don't believe him and literally think I'm the plug. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to hack into someone's Facebook account without permission. Although we don't talk through fb, our first dope man lost his phone for a while and he has messages on there. Honestly the only legal evidence they have is hearsay so I don't think I should worry but if anyone has any thoughts I'd appreciate them. This is so fucked up. ",1513801653.0

I consumed between 0.15-0.2g of heroin on Monday night between 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. The purity is questionable, it's relatively good but definitely cut with something. My ingestion method was intranasal. Additionally I used throughout the weekend and consumed a little under a gram.

I am on probation currently and test randomly throughout the week (please spare me the ""Why did you use if you knew you could be tested?"" comments, I know, I know). I test tomorrow. Around the time I will need to drop, between 60 and 64 hours will have passed. I understand that it takes between 2-4 days on average for all of its metabolites to completely clear one's system and I have passed before at the three day mark.

I've been drinking a lot of water and green tea, and I have a very high base metabolism, which has saved me multiple times before in these kinds of situations (knock on wood).

Since the elimination half-life of morphine is between 2-4 hours, I was curious to see if I would pass a test with a cut off of 2,000 ng/mL (my probation's cut off level is 300 ng/mL). My rationale was that if half of the quantity is being eliminated each 2-3 hours, I would be below 2,000 ng/mL at the 34 hour mark. Thankfully I passed, which leads me to believe that tomorrow, I should be well below 300 by the time I test.

Can anyone check my understanding on this? Any advice would be appreciated, even if it's just that I'm better of telling my case manager that I will fail.",1513801573.0

I have access to OC 20's and split them in half. I start my day off at 5 AM before I get in the shower for work and pop a half, then usually another 5mg (half of a half) when I arrive at work. Then Another Half of a half around lunch time, half of a half for the drive home and finally a last half of a half when I get home.

Wife and family don't know i'm using so I don't have much of a support system. The only person that knows is ironically my boss, and my dboy who also is my best friend of 15 years.

I have heard its best to start tapering your use to avoid that sudden WD. 

What is the best way to start tapering? I know going CT is not an option for me because while not a huge habit, I still feel like shit in the morning sometimes. Kratom, some Aleve, and a bowl helps.

I left the house and went to my sisters to detox, I’m on day 3 with very minimal sub maintenance and my sister is feeding me edibles every few hours.

I had said a few days before that my next buy would be either 200 or 300 worth. Will fast forward to the trade I only had 200 (I told him this on the way there) and he goes well the bag is a little heavier so you owe me 50 okay? I had no problems with this... but then after some excitement over losing his dog to a mall employee in a wheelchair (a story for another time...) he was hurriedly loading his doggo back into the truck and taking off when he shouts back ""Don't forget you owe me money!! Actually that bag was really heavy, you owe me 100... no 150! Okay see you next time"" now I'm just sitting there stunned like what just happened lol. I didn't have a scale on me, but I really doubt it was 150 worth extra.


I had told him I would pay him back on my next payday so I had some free days of picking up like usual, but then eventually the day rolls around and he's saying okay so you owe me 150 oh and 40 for that other time!! You remember? (No I do not remember Mr. Dman...) In addition to this he had been saying he could give me one of his winter coats because he had tons. Originally this was going to be a free hand-me-down and it turned into me buying his $100 shoplifted coat (I saw it with the security clip and tags still on and everything haha). So all of a sudden I owe him just shy of three hundo plus whatever I want to buy for myself this time. I ended up just ducking his calls because this would have wiped out my paycheque way too quickly and I needed it for other non-dope things.


I wasn't planning to ever deal with him again because I kind of felt like he was trying to bully me around until I found out from one of his street level guys (I was buying from him and he was like ""dude why aren't you just buying from <boss>?"" ) I am one of literally only like 3-5 people that he will deal with personally. He even let's me come to his house, see his family, etc. So I'm thinking if this high level guy is treating me like this maybe it's worth keeping the connect you know? Fast forward to this morning and I had plenty of $$$ saved with enough to pay him back plus an order for the holidays. I just made up a story about my phone breaking and just got a new one with my old numbers imported. His early texts seemed reasonable so I optimistically called him and he is just PISSED. ""WTF dude I needed that money, now my girl is stranded in XXXX city and she is flipping out at me."" I was just kind of laughing because he had bragged to me about their combined habit of $5000 a month before so along with being high up in the chain why is my $300 so important???


Anyway, what would you guys do at this point? Vanish along with ""his"" money, or relinquish the dough to keep the dope flowing. Note that I have other connects, some with slightly better stuff even, but he is extremely convenient and available pretty much all the time - I believe his guy that he doesn't serve many others. Now despite such a large supposed front I've actually only been buying directly from him for about a month now. And with my old guy I used before I moved I had zero problems with paying back fronts because I understand the mutual respect they generate. With this new guy I am tempted to cut contact just to stop this chaos, the only thing is he seems genuinely dangerous compared to others I've dealt with. I looked up his court appearances and it is just overflowing, one of the worst probably being an assault along with ""threatening to kill someone"". However he doesn't know my real name or where I live and because he doesn't come to the street often (ever?) I'm not likely to run into him even if I have to cold cop. Also I'm in Canada so there is way less chance he owns a gun.


Sorry for the encyclopedia friends! He'll undoubtedly be blowing my phone up today looking for his girl's flight money while I think of what to do...


EDIT - Forgot to add important thing. On the call this morning he says ""I'll let you decide how much extra I get for being late"" I'm just sitting there thinking ""Hmmm after much deliberation I've decided zero extra!"" It kind of just seems like a no-win scenario paying him back, he is certainly not encouraging me to... I either give him too much basically letting the bully win, or I throw him like a $20 extra and he refuses to deal with me anymore for being disrespectful or something.",1513957921.0

His youtube channel has 27 videos at this time. I have copied links to the 5 videos of his poetry. Newest to oldest. If you start with the oldest, you can really see progress and change.
Many of the videos are of his son, and girlfriends daughter. You can clearly see how good of a father this man is. 
Also, some of his business operation.

7li0eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7li0eu/a_bid_farewell/,14,https://redd.it/7li0eu,gigalongdong,A Bid Farewell,"Good morning y'all. Due to my use of heroin since giving up the sober life in late September; my life has become unmanageable once again. I've nearly lost my apartment twice and most recently almost lost my amazing fiance to a batch of super potent ECP last week.

So, I'm hanging up the syringes and straws once again. This time I fully plan on leaving this chapter of my life behind in totality. It's time for me to look forward to an opiate free future with my fiance and our dog, Georgia. That's going to start tomorrow with another three month stint at some sort of rehab.

I don't want this to sound like a sob story

I love all you amazing people. And I wish you all long lives, safe drug usage, and no more dopesickeness.

i have been on it for like 8 months now, and was wondering where anyone else stands on the 'blocking endorphins that you naturally produce' argument. I have the feeling, and general notion from my basic understanding of how these drugs and brain stuff works, that it does effect the way we feel general pleasure.

i was in the military and loved working out, now when i work out, i just get nauseous, and whether that is linked to my second issue of my appetite being gone, or if vivitrol effected the way i receive pleasure from eating. also my sleep is highly interrupted and not restful, sometimes with gabapentin i sleep well. maybe vivitrol has effected that too.

or maybe it has just been the past 3 years of general opiate abuse that has fucked me up, and me being me is just looking for a scapegoat.

Wanted to send love n share some hope,"**Sorry if this comes across as preaching! I just have seen a lot of posts about changing being hopeless, so I wanted to share some hope.**    
     
I used to spend a lot of time here, and wanted to give you all a shoutout and send some love. To some it may not seem like a lot, but it is for me. 67 days is the most time I have had sober since 2004. I was a ""functioning"" addict for 10+ years until I started smokin rock and usin the needle. Then shit went downhill faster than I ever could have imagined. This post isn't meant to preach, I just wanted to let others know breaking the cycle isn't impossible (like I thought it was.)      
     
How my life was... I was waking up wanting to blow my brains out every day. I had family set my window so it couldn't open past 6 in. cause I kept wanting to jump out. My relationships were bust, family shattered, vehicles totaled, my most prized and personal possessions pawned, and more. Every time I put a little time together and decided to go back out, I found new rock bottoms and even lower lows. It may sound strange, but I am grateful for having heroin at the time cause it allowed me to bandaid my pain long enough to make it to a point I could start fixing my life again and get to the point I am at now.    
    
I thought I could never be happy again or enjoy anything sober. I found that assumption, and many others like it, to be completely wrong. I am getting things back, forging real relationships, rekindling old ones, have a plan beyond my next high and more. I know it's not a lot of time, but compared to the other times I got sober, its quality time and my life is finally coming back together.     
    
No matter where you are, it's not the end. If you're still usin, please be safe. If anyone wants someone to talk to, I am here. Most importantly, keep your head up and know that when you're ready to move on (and if you were a hopeless junkie like me), you can do it to.    
    
Much love to my r/opiate fam. Stay safe out there.

Some background; 2 years of opiate use,  the first chunk heroin, (ecp) last 6-8 months suboxone. Iv all the way. (When I fuck up I don't dick around I suppose.)

I took this week off work to cold turkey, get through the worst of the twitching and chills and power through the rest with caffeine and sleep aides. I won't get into messy details but I didn't make it. I think one of the issues was that I was cutting my strips as I took it and I kept going bigger.  

So I went and bought a pill box and cut up half a strip into 14 little chunks of roughly the same size. I now have a pill box full of tiny suboxone strips dosed out for the next week.  I'll make the next ones slightly smaller and so on.  But I find it ridiculous that I'm having such issue with withdrawl on the tiny dose I'm on.  Seriously, one 8mg strip lasts almost 2 weeks.  

I know I should stop shooting it,  but I'm being lazy about figuring out sublingual dosage. I'll have to at some point, my veins are not happy campers. 

Please don't lecture me,  I got that enough at opiatesrecovery when I asked a simple question about sub withdrawl time lines. Lots of ""you've had your fun now pay the piper and stop whining"" but very little help. I just wanted to give you a picture in your head of a little pill box with little tiny pieces of suboxone in the am and pm spaces and maybe make you smile. I'll kick it at some point.

I've been a steady opiate addict for around ten years now. Just some background info to sort of relate that my withdrawal is pretty serious when it happens. I currently IV hydromorphone 12mg every two to three hours. So here's my Story about my blessed situation. It might help someone else who IVs Hydromorph possibly. So I had just finished my 150th pill and settled into what I knew would be a nightmare withdrawal. I waited until about 6 hours after my last shot to take some sleeping pills to get rest since I knew I'd be up for the next few days. 6 hours later I wake up and realize the cottons I'd been using were all dried up in a single pile. I thought it couldn't hurt so I put 20 or so to soak in around 3ml of water. I was already in withdrawal so anything would help. Miny junkie blessing #1. It immediately set me right. I had weeks to go until I could get fresh pills so I made the rest of the cottons last about 48 hours.  I lay down again to wait for withdrawals to set in again. After around 96 hours of restless hell I get up and decide to try eat something. I'm in hell wishing I would just die already and my toe brushes by a small cardboard box where I had been scraping out the powder/filler that's left after you make your shot of hydromorph. I look inside and for whatever reason I had religiously dumped all 150 pills worth of the stuff leftover after you make your shot. I never dump that stuff out. I usually eat it after every injection. I'm kind of excited thing I might be able to add some water and filter out a shot or 2. At this stage my coordination was awful, my vision wasn't right, I couldn't do any sort of fine motor control type of movements so I dump half in a huge pill bottle, like 5 inches high and an inch and a half in diameter, then add enough water to cover it by and inch and a half so. When it all settled out there was over an inch of this stuff with an inch at least of water above the line of that settled out powder. I stir and shake it then filter out a full 2cc shot. It was like taking a regular shot. I was saved. Junkie Jesus had provided me with a huge amount of these dregs that were enough to completely set me right and since I spaced out the shots this time I had enough to get me to a fresh supply of pills. Sorry for this wall of text but I had to tell someone and I couldn't tell anyone I know. TL;DR - found a new supply that normally wouldn't be there. Got fixed up right.",1513906312.0

When his mom bought a car he had a friend at the dealership who maybe gave them a good deal but definitely was subjected to inconvenient bullshit. The first day they picked up the car they didn't have enough money for the whole down payment. His mom cam down in the old van and pleaded the disabled card to no avail. The following day his younger brother loaned them a sack of money to cover the down payment and they made off with a car.


Naturally, the car was eventually repoed less than a couple of years later. Cliff's brother was owed money for a long time, in fact still is. Cliff's mom used to occasionally borrow money from her younger son for the electric bill or other necessities and promise repayment based on lies pedaled by her older son, Cliff. 

&nbsp;

Before I got into opiates, I'd sit down in Cliff's living room to smoke a blunt while surfing the web. His mom would call from the other room and ask about various people.

* ""Did you call Tommy?"" - His bookie? No doubt Cliff said this guy was gonna drop off money.

* ""Did you see Brad yet?"" - A person who who Cliff told his mom he was getting money from for some kind of trade. Money that she probably was owed or needed to pay for food or utilities.

* ""Did you go to the store yet?"" Cliff would say NO, and she would say ""I need my medicine."" Most likely the Xanax he took and sold off or the second half of her roxy srcipt that he was ""keeping safe"".

* ""Did yo see Denny yet?"" - Another person who supposedly had money for Cliff... he might say the guy is coming at 9PM. His mom would check back at 10PM and he'd be like ""no, you're stressing me out."" Then she'd check at midnight and he'd say ""stop asking stupid questions.""

&nbsp; 

Cliff basically did the same stuff to me. In my case he would get half a bun, give me table scraps and say ""my friend is dropping off the rest at 9PM."" I'd show up at 10PM and wait till 1AM. For the whole weekend he would give me revised ETAs until he ultimately blamed his ""friend"" for the negative outcome.


Before I got into dope and before his car got repossessed, I needed a favor with a ride to another town. Basically I needed to pick up a very heavy computer so he was like ""no problem, I'll give you a ride on Tuesday morning."" I had to reschedule three times with the guy I was picking the machine up from. I almost didn't get it but luckily I had another more reliable friend who was willing to give me a ride.


In retrospect, maybe he was running low in pills. I know I've postponed plans based on my ""withdrawal schedule"". 

&nbsp;


Sometimes Cliff borrows from his mom's roxy script and says he'll replace it. So of course she'll be like ""did you see Chris yet?"" Chris being the nickname for the pill connect.


I've learned that Cliff would sometimes get me to give him money out of desperation when low in pills or dope and promise pay back a day or two later. Two days later nothing is happening because ""the pill connect is being a jerk and taking his time"". Then on pay day, all of a sudden that same pill connect is here at warp speed. 

&nbsp;


A while back a kid around the block had a fake $100 bill so him and Cliff decided to call the dboy and spend that $100. Fucking idiots. I told them that was the stupidest idea and the dboy told him it was fake right away. Didn't accuse him of giving him the fake money on purpose I think he knew. Junkies gonna junk. 


A week later, we ordered dope and were getting the runaround waiting. When the dope was finally delivered it was bunk. The funny part of that story is when the dboy said, ""I'll bring it to my tester""(the guy who tests his dope for him). What good is a tester if he's not testing the shit ahead of time. We sure waited long enough! lol


Of course the dboy said that the guy in the chain above him screwed him and yes I know our ""dboy"" is a middle. So as a result he wouldn't replace the dope for free but he did offer a discount on a future batch. Shortly thereafter he ghosted.

&nbsp;

Back to near recent time, he was supposed to get a used car from a friend. At one point he borrowed a car from a friend and pretended it was his own. His mom was getting pissed that she was cooped up inside so he had to do something so that he could drive her to the doctor, go to the store and just get some fresh air.

Eventually he pretended the car was parked around he block and used that as an excuse to not run errands. Then said something broke in the car and that the person who gave him the car was getting it fixed for WEEKS on end until eventually he made up some bullshit reason as to why he doesn't have the car that he never had.",1513889091.0

It was about many years ago but I was in prison serving a 5 year sentence. I only had a few months left so all was pretty good at the time. I had what we call a prison habit, I need about 0.1 #3 a day smoked to keep me well. Its not a big habit but enough to be sick nonetheless.

Its a tradition in Irish prisons to give people temporary release for Christmas with anything from just the day to a week back home at Christmas time and is given to people who are coming near the end of their sentence. As I only had a few months left, I did of course apply for it. I was cautious because when your locked up there is nothing worse than disappointment so you try keep your head inside by not having hope. My friends were more excited than me in all honesty because they knew I would come back ""fully loaded"" with enough dope and benzos to keep us going for the whole of january. There would even had been a little crack just for a treat. I would have needed something for the pain in my ass anyways having to rape myself getting all of that in and out.

I was doing a psychology degree though open university in the prison school as well and I got on really well with the Vice Principal. She loved me cause I was considered a bit of a no-hoper by the Officers so it made the school look good. Anyways she tells me that they put up a couple of names every year to recommend they get Christmas out and that its pretty much a guarantee when they do. All was looking great until the list of names came back and I wasnt on it. They dont give you a reason but it could have been that the Gardai (police) objected.

Now normally I would have Christmas all wrapped up so to speak. I would have 3 people going out to take visits for me just in case one of them got caught. I made sure I always had a nice sized bag of dope to get me though the depression of Christmas in Prison. You try to tell yourself its just another day but unless your made of fucking stone your going to have your head dragged outside and the pain of loss that comes with it. This year I had let it all slip because I bought into hope and now I was completely screwed.

About 5 days before Christmas the whole place dried up because everything is held back for Christmas. I was lying in my cell feeling the wds kicking in like the damn mule that they are while being tortured by some do-gooder lunatics who thought it was a good idea to be let into the prison after bang up to sing Christmas carols to a wing of 130 prisoners who wanted to chop their heads off, not for any other reason than it would stop them torturing us with fucking Christmas carols. At least they went home to sip on brandy in front of the fire and smugly tell whoever would listen how they brought joy to scum that was us.

Over the next few days a few people who I was friends with all had promised to help me out, a point here and a half g there. As grateful as I was because its prison unless its in your hand its as useless as the rent a cop fools that open and close gates for a job. Finally got to Christmas eve and I was sitting in my cell with a buddy of mine depressed to hell. Just about everyone's plans had gone to shit, never saw anything like it. One fool even put diesel in a petrol car so the visitor with the dope couldn't get up to the prison. The writing was on the wall, and it was bad. The crazy thing was the previous three years even if I hadn't organised my own there was plenty around so I would have been ok. This year everything was fucked.

It was 3;30pm and visits would be closed in a half hour so here it is Merry fucking Christmas. We were just sitting in the cell watching some shit on the TV, couldnt even talk to each other as the realization of the emotional torture for the next 48 hours was about to become a reality.

Next thing we hear ""REDZER! RED!"" being shouted from the gate at the bottom of the landing. My buddy Red popped out of his slouch with his eyes wide open and back straight looking like one of those Meercats. None of us said anything but we were both thinking exactly the same thing, he hopped up and flew out the door. I was sitting there for about a minute just praying ""please please just a point between us would get Christmas eve out of the way"". Red bounces back in the door and Ill never forget those words ""its an miracle,  A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE, A FUCKING OUNCE!"". I jumped up out my chair and the 2 of us swung each other around like we were doing a demented Irish jig. The fucking Joy surged though my sick bones.

After the obligatory grabbing the foil off a packet of mints and getting a nice quarter gram rolling I asked him what? who? how?.
It was a new guy who had just been transferred, he was a friend of Red from treatment some years before and I had included him on a quarter gram between the 3 of us a couple of times. His only instructions was that nobody except the 3 of us were to get any. Of course we scooped a gram each into cigarette papers which I felt bad about later because the guy gave me 2 grams later to have when we were banged up. Well I didn't feel that bad but I thought I should feel bad. We spent the next week nodding and have to say its up there with best Christmas ever.

Genuinely I wish everyone here who want to be stoned this Christmas gets it and anyone who doesn't enjoy being sober. Just remember miracles do happen... sometimes.",1513881437.0

I've been lurking for years. I had a question about use and leading a healthy lifestyle.

My DOC is Panda40 or rox30s. One of them (panda) usually last me 48hr. A 30mg roxy tho, will last me roughly half the day. 
I try to dose 10mg (panda) nasally, every 8-10hr. With drugs, it has never eaten alive my money, or possessions, etc, Ive always been extremely highly functioning.. not bragging, just explaining my situation for perspective. I actually have the opposite problem, I will only buy a very small amount at a time. 

How would you convince yourself to buy enough for the week as opposed to enough for 2 days? I always do this, and it annoys my dealer as he is also aware that I'm not exactly struggling, and we meet up a fairly good amount... I just feel so dumb finding myself spending more than 75-85$ at a time on drugs.. anytime i've spent over 250$, i immediately try to start making $ back. I just can't make myself spend over 250 on anything. I have this weird mental thing with it, I literally can't do it. I'm making an entire thread on how to convince myself to spend $ basically, haha...

Maybe being frugal has saved me from a crazy high tolerance or crazy epensive habit? I'm on my 10th year on this shit, and still can do 30mg of rox, or 10mg of panda at a time and be good for 8-10hr. I've always secretly felt the reason I can use this little and keep control is because anti-depressants never worked... I always wanted to off myself until I found opiates... then I became fairly successful on them. The most negative affects have been on certain relationships and some physical health.

Has anyone developed stomach issues? (Such as acid reflux or any problems from the long term constipation?.. I have only been sick like 3 or 4 times this decade, so my gut isn't exactly up to par. But I do force one out at least every other day.) 
And does anyone else get dental issues from this? I think getting dry mouth from using and snorting the stuff has cause a decent amount of damage. I'm curious how one would use and avoid snorting to save their nose some damage? And if anyone else has gained dental problems- not to hygiene- but to dry mouth? Any tips on maintaining my health would be appreciated. I don't want my nose to fall off and to be toothless at 40. I take care of myself and have the means too, yet i am still experiencing minor dental issues and nasal damage.. I know asking for a different route of administrating might be crossing the forum rules, i apologize if so, just curious if there is any other way to use other than snorting or poking?

I sincerely appreciate any advice. Thanks for reading. This is sort of a shit post...  I dno... Not may people I can talk to this about..Sorta writing off of the top of my head. Thanks again.

I am not new to opiates or benzos, I don't bang anything and have been using norcos and valiums mainly to keep me going during finals from addy and coke come downs. 

I know it's not the safest way to use pills but are there that many good reasons?  Anyways, finals are over now and I would like to cut back to my weed smoking dominant habit and quit daily hydro use. It could be worse i know, the other week I vomited after a line, cigarette, and coffee in the morning and took half a pill ad immediately felt better...I went about my day but today after 5 or so days later a very acute back pain woke me up around 3 AM and I thought my bed had been causing the pain so I ate 10mg of valium and did yoga. I tried laying on the hardwood for a while and eventually i think the pills kicked in and I feel blissful again.

This pretty standard for you all? I'm going home soon for break and I am not sure if buying more valiums instead of more norcos or morphines in effort to kick the opiates at least... 

maybe not kick but is this acute back pain gonna persist if i keep using?

Cuz damn these hydros have been amazing. I am able to be twice as productive as well as happy throughout my finals. Normally, the extreme doses of adderall with daily cocaine use leave me tweaky so i use benzos to counter the side-effects but those fog my brain like a mofo (better for partying)

This had been working just fine for me until the time came for my annual pain in the ass to come around to assault me again - cold. I cannot hit for shit in the cold. I'm a very thin female with very tiny veins, and when it's cold outside those little fuckers shrivel up and retreat, only to be brought to the surface by hot showers or some kind of exercise, which are not always possible. My arms are hard enough to hit in good weather, in the cold they're fucking impossible. 

Out of exasperation, I've taken to shooting up in my feet. There's some great veins down there, big ol ropes that I can usually register with 1 or 2 tries. I am extremely careful not to miss when I'm hitting my feet or ankles, as I have made this mistake before and holy shit did it hurt. Not something I want to go through again. What I'm wondering is: how come, despite my obsessive precautions, do I still get these histamine-reaction-like rashes in the areas of my foot I'm shooting up in? 

I register, untie, re-register, and depress the plunger slowly, registering again halfway through just to be sure I'm still in (even tho I would know right away if I were missing), and despite all this I'm still ending up with that splotchy, red lumpy rash that I get on my hands/arms when I miss a bit up there. This shit hurts WAY worse on my feet than it has ever hurt my hands or wrists, and the pain lingers for days at a time. Not to mention it itches with a fiery, burning wrath and that itch follows my vein halfway up my leg immediately after I hit. My ankles have been swollen for days since hitting there around last Thursday, and I know I didn't miss even a little. 

Does anyone know what might be causing this and is there anything I can do to prevent it? I know obviously I can hit somewhere else, and I'm trying to find some other spots, but if anyone has any advice for me in the meantime I would appreciate it a great deal...cause for now I'm walking with a pretty prominent limp. Feet are always a last resort, first I try my hands/wrists/arms, but lately those just haven't been accessible. It's really upsetting to start every damn day waking up sick, then spending however long repeatedly stabbing myself with a needle, bleeding everywhere, getting frustrated and sometimes crying and occasionally missing and making all the effort and pain for nothing.

Thanks y'all! Apologies if this is a dumb question, if anything I'm mostly curious as to why the rash/pain is happening...my guess is that when I stand back up after hitting, maybe some of the shot leaks out of the hole in my vein and reacts in the same way a miss would...? I dunno. Sorry 4 the wall, I've been banging coke tonight and this post is way longer than it should be. Hope everyone is having a good night. JJ bless u all.",1514019864.0

They seem to apply that when you get treatment from a Suboxone doctor you are flagged in some way so that for instance at the hospital they know you once got Suboxone for opioid dependence. 
Also, I'd like to know the same thing for methadone. If it is true, how is the information shared? Is there some sort of national database? If this is the case, fuck America. I was taking my medicines as prescribed and when I moved to CA I could no longer find a doctor to prescribe them. Rather than look every day for a doc or go onto heroin or black market stuff I decided to just get off and use subs for the dependence. I thought I was doing the socially acceptable thing but I swear to God if I get flagged as a junky for that the first thing I'm doing is buying something good to take the edge off. (Not saying I'm not a junky of in any way better than you guys for using script/orally. We're all just trying to ease our pain and i was just lucky enough to have met a rather stupid/careless/friendly doctor and gotten a script for a few months.

I come to you now knowing love and I want to bring you with me. Come, it's fun. 

I start with heroine for many year. Too many year!! 
I use long time heroine, all the different kinds. I make some people mad, but i like drugs
I go to Japan. Good clean culture I think. But Then I got on the dihydrocodeines, but with caffeine! I sweated really sweaty from no good caffeine. From Japan they no more let me stay, to many times. In airport, In detention center, I drop bags and run to smoking room because long nighty, no ciggrettes. They not think it's funny time, so in morning they send me china, china send me vietnam. Vietnam cool, because heroine. I do some stuff here, and i am friend with pharmacy. Cool vietnam. I ride bike to Laos, Laos opium and heroine. Yuymm, but no! Sinking deeper again! Life look bleak when not having heroine. So I leave Laos, go japan, yay, they let me in this time, and there I learn to english teaching the whole month and one half I am there. I did not pass course, but I learn many engliush skills! But oh no, I'm back on the sweater dihydrocodeens and I taking a lot, making bad sweatys and bad sleepings. Now I am no more there, I head to india! In india, very spiritful, many good things. Yes, I now take shit medicine to stop ass water, but also it stop all the bad thing. It is loperamide. I take this and tramadol. I go into mountains and meet many babas and babus, and babalos in great ancient city on ganga river. I am swimming cold ganga and feeling full power 24 hour. I am meeting babas, and sometimes I have religion heroine with the babas, but not often. There I am smoking very much weeds and spiritful is alive and the sweet music that sounds from the very depths on my true and tortured soul the melody sounds uniquely familiar to what I imagine people call peace. Something ephemeral. I go to dessert and ride camel with crazy krew and we are doing drugs overnights in desert. I go to other dimension many time and I become sun king with my camel, Ramirez. We find treasure of the heart in dessert together and I go back to mountains to find girl I fall in loves her. She is cosmic fox and I like her pretty words and way she run around world. We fall in love in different ways, but she does not want and no do I, but one hour before taxi to airport she marry me, very beautiful. We say beautiful words. I take gabapentin, lopreem, and last tramadol and go in taxi. No more drugs! Taper over, no bad feelings, I poop tho hAHhahHA LOts of poop and ass water. India food good to my ass tho. Very spicy, but no burn ass water! Chile fresh, all food pureveg, good for soul. I vegetarian again! Very helpful! 

Now I am go here to crazy funny argentina! No drugs! Country here on brink of revolution. I smoking weeds and meditating. I in the far country though, in nice house where I writing and practice english with cat (gato), his name Loco and he is very loco.

They looked spot on bc I remember last time this middle took me to this plug they seemed off.  I thought they didn't dissolve in my stomach right or something that time bc I think I took 12 and didn't really feel shit. 


So since that day I've been dissolving my pills in a small cup of water and just drinking it.   That actually did help with the high a lot so I continued doing it.  Well we got these today and I had pretty much convinced myself that last time we copped from here the pills not working was just due to the pills not dissolving in my stomach.  Anyways, I dissolved 9 of these fuckers and drank them.  

Immediately, fucking immediately, knew the taste was off.  I drop the middle off and get back to my house (maybe 1 mile) and I'm tripping out.   The taste was terrible and it seemed to stick in my mouth.   I vomited not 5 minutes after getting there.  I vomited repeatedly for over an hour and was really fucking worried.. contemplated the hospital but I have an HSA with a wife and young kid.  I can't drain the money we have in that account over this.  I was not having any issues breathing and heart rate seemed fine but my stomach was straight LOSING it.  

I knew if my stomach was rejecting it that hard it couldn't be real hydrocodone.  My tummy loves that shit.  I started trying to drink water and before I could even swallow three times it was coming back up.  I was down for throwing all this shit up so I just kept drinking water and puking to basically rinse my stomach out. 

I text the middle, who I am pretty positive was not in on this, and tell her don't take hers.  She either takes a $10 fee or one pill of what you're getting if that's what she'd rather have.  These were fucking $8 a pop.  Stupid expensive I know, but still cheaper than $10 and she could have had that in cash bc I had it ready.  So I think she's innocent in this.

Anyways, I tell her and she's a lil skeptical but I straight up told her fucking do not take that pill.  I have a WAAAYY higher tolerance than she does.  She just had a baby so was clean for over 9 months and never had a large tolerance in the first place (just in case these had fent or whatever).  She text me later and said that someone else called her and said they were fake so she finally believed it for sure.  

Idk if these had fent in them or not.. I don't think so bc I felt nothing but nausea.. you would think you'd get that opiate feeling somewhere along the way.  I took all of them so I don't have any left to take a picture of but I'm thinking of taking one of those drug tests that tests for fent.

I've been taking pills for over 14 years and this is my first for sure experience with a fake pill.  Now that I know I'm pretty sure they were fake last time too.  Idk why they didn't make me sick af then but they did now... maybe they changed something.

Luckily I have some pot how to help with this nausea.

Be careful out there guys.  This was in a bum fuck rural middle American town where I have never seen or heard of a pressed fake.  You always get people trying to sell Tylenol as Lortab but not fake like this.


TL;DR - Got fake pills, puked them up, still feel like shit.

It's been going smoothly so far, except for this one little thing... 

So where I'm staying at right now there are two dogs, both of them between 1 and 2 years old (Ya know, people years) so they're fucking bonkers. When I'm in the house, they freak the fuck out if I walk from one room to the other and might have a seizure or something if they're not coming with me. On top of that they're always fighting each other when they're doing their thing where they follow me, it gets pretty fuckin savage honestly it's great. If they're not fighting while accompanying my 5-10 foot treks across this house, they get so jacked to be going somewhere with me that they race ahead of me and I trip on them. Oh and they tried to eat the bed and the home owners wooden deck outside. 

So that's my company most of the time. 

Here's the mishap. In my new room there's this kickass desk where I do all of my weighing and bagging. I have a little prop thing to stick my phone in so the flashlight can illuminate the work area and I can see every little speck of product. Sometimes I'm not being careful, sometimes I straight fuck up, sometimes the dogs knock me over, but I've spilled a good bit of my meth on the floor in front of the desk. I get the big chunks immediately and save little stuff for later, I don't like carpet scrounging it makes me hate myself that much more. These dogs will be battling each other around me while I do my thing at the desk. It wasn't until last night I realized part of what they've been doing since I got bulk. They scrounge around the carpet and sniff/lick up all my meth. 

They fucking for this shit you guys it's terrible. There won't be anything on the ground and they're both sucking their faces to the ground running along where it spills from the desk like a fucking lawnmower on... well meth. I was wondering where all of it went but I wasn't too worried because it's just spill on a carpet, but they've got recovering down to a T. They've been doing this for 3 or 4 days now and I just noticed last night. So here's the dilemma. 

These guys owe me money now. But they're dogs. How do I communicate this to them?",1513988764.0

7ll7cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ll7cv/whats_the_worst_part_of_wd_for_you/,26,https://redd.it/7ll7cv,TattedLegendUGKing,What’s the worst part of wd for you?,"Title says it all, also if you wanna read about being an addict for the past 6 years, currently age 22. Day 5 of wd right now and I feel great all things considered, honestly. Basically just writing this if for any reason it’s to just write  it down somewhere so I can come back and read this. Don’t go back. 

Personally for me, when I know I’m going to go through withdrawal and mentally prepare for it like I have this time, It almost seems like I can start making my brain naturally reproduce the endorphins that have slowed, not at 100% but to an extent. 

The first 2 days I can easily recognize the ‘fake depression and anxiety’ (I call it ‘fake’ Bc I know I normally don’t experience those feelings) and brush it off. Unfortunately I can’t do much about the physical symptoms. RLS drives me insane I hate it the most alongside puking , but this time I went through WD after IV dope for 4 weeks and it has been the mildest WD I’ve ever had probably due to Kratom but also because I decided to do this and tapered down to a final dose of .075 in a 24h period. So hopped off at less than a point when I was up to .75-1g at the peak probably. The taper was pretty fast probably like over 7 days. Started Kratom next morning and I haven’t had ANY puking, diarrhea, my only symptoms have been mild RLS/insomnia which I can still normally sleep 4-6 hrs per night in spurts with gaba clonidine and Kratom. I’ve been tapering down my Kratom dose as well, today (day 5) im at 7g 2x a Day morning and before sleep. I started at 7g 4x a day like every 4-5 hours as needed. Gonna be off by day 7-10 tops. 

Aside from RLS, I really do hate the lethargy/lack of energy from WD Bc I’m a gym rat and that’s how I was able to previously have 1 1/2 years of clean time. So I got back in the gym on day 3 of WD but I’ve lost about at least 20 lbs of bulk muscle weight. I was pretty fuckin big and I need to get back to that. Probably gonna run a cycle and then cruise test long term because I’ve already been on and off gear (steroids, testosterone) the past two years as well. Haven’t been on test for at least 6mo now though. I fell into this addiction about the length of time my reddit account has been alive. 212 days. FUCK. That’s more than half a year I’ve thrown away. I’m only 22 years old. To anyone young that reads this, I promise you don’t want this life. The risk is not worth any reward one might be seeking. 

P.s. there is no reward. 

That’s how I like to see it. Before then I used occasionally but not dependent to not be sick. Still have never felt psychologically addicted to a substance, just enjoyed abusing it and using it for lengths of time. Happened with benzos before too those gave me 3 seizures from 3 separate WDs but luckily never fucked up my head like some people go through bad. Man I’m really forcing myself to focus on rebuilding reward pathways. This is the only way to beat this. Even though I may not feel the happiness from doing something, I make sure to do everything I can that I know should make me happy, and I tell myself “this is good, I need to do this, this makes me happy and promotes a good life, etc” so I’ll be back in the gym today forsure, I’m helping my dad do some errands, grocery shop, pick up the truck from the shop, go out to eat, take the RV back to storage, anything that I can that promotes a positive life. I’m hoping I had my ‘ah ha’ moment, this girl really wanted me to shoot her up but she didn’t tell me she was drunk and on xans already, and I hit her with .05 of decent quality stuff and she ended up falling out/ODing And I hit her with IM naloxone and then gave cpr and she started breathing and came to like 7-10 min? Later I’m not sure I have no perception of time for this incident. I made the cap from that syringe into a keychain to remind me to stay away. 

It’s so crazy how easily we justify putting a drug in our veins that we know we can so easily die from. And yet I’m sure there’s gonna be a day where I’m gonna think “damn, I could totally get high just today and continue being clean after.” I can’t do that though. I just got to wake up everyday and say “today, I am happy healthy and clean” cuz that’s all we can ever speak for right, is today. If you got this far then thanks for reading. I’m just writing down whatever I’m thinking so I can read this when I need to. 

Until next time. 
TLDR: RLS and lack of energy sucks ass. I’m a 22 yr old poly drug addict gym rat. 6 years of addiction. Kratom is killing about 70-80% of my wd symptoms. Killing someone and reviving them isn’t cool. You have to mentally and actively attack wd to beat it or it will win every time. Thx4reading. ",1513986284.0

Longest I’ve gone without was 2 months , and I was still having random dreams where I’d be doing Lines and in the dream I’d feel THAT feeling...the warm blanket coming over me. So realistic that I’d wake up looking for the drugs I thought I just had, sending me into horrible craving usually resulting in relapse.

The last 2 months I’ve attenpted to quit like 4 times. I fail after a week when I get money again. This Time though, i have to. I can’t sustain a $100-300/day habit. 

I’m barely paying bills, and if I continue my whole life will fall apart. I’ve tried using subs and dones for the first 4 days just to get through the worst of it, but it’s the mental aspect that seems like it will never change. Struggled with depression and anxiety since a kid. I have no extreme trauma or abuse stories, I had a good upbringing . My brain just loves opiates. I’ve given a 30mg kind of oxy to a friend who’d never tried them and he got less high than I did and I was doing 4 a day at that point.

Anyways, I got a last grab of 12 blue, 5 op 80s and 5 Valium yesterday, planning to have fun w the blues and then use the OP To do a 4 day taper.

I swallowed 2 blues and snorted one, then ate an 80. I’m barely high, like 4/10. I’m a small dude too. All I can think about is the impending doom of jumping off a 300mg/day habit when in the past the worst it’s been is max 200/day.

Physical wd is mostly over after 2 days for me bc I have such a fast metabolism, Ive never thrown up from WD before, just all the other symptoms. Throwing up would b the final thing to push me into making that drive to the ghetto...

Fuck man. I’m scared. Doesn’t help that I have to play it off as just a cold to my roomies and then a group of friends on Xmas 😞 any tips are extremely appreciated.

Indisputable heavyweight champ of bad drugs.

Last night, I looked up quite a few pieces about the worst drugs... Alcohol took home first place, heroin was a strong second in **all** things I found. 

You know, heroin feels the SAME -- more or less, it really does -- as pain pills. It really is sad that opioid painkillers are available in such abundance in the United States, or at least were, even though they equate to heroin. Just not as much of a stigma on them. Not too many people flinch at the mention of abusing pain pills. Bring up heroin? Yeah, you are the devil himself.

So, this leads me to ask you knowledgeable people here on r/o....

*Why do you think heroin is so bad, or why do you think others crown heroin as the number-one or number-two ""worst drug ever""?*

From what I gathered, Here's what makes heroin ""bad"":

High frequency of IV use, often resulting in unsafe injecting practices.

Heroin is obviously not regulated, only  outlawed, meaning purity is impossible to reasonably ascertain. There are also adulterants that are bad for the body.

This is a relatively new phenomenon -- at least in terms of how damn popular this bullshit is now -- but fentanyl can easily be found in street heroin, potentially causing near-instant death. 

I know that heroin addicts can have bad hygiene and just get so lazy they don't really contribute to work and stuff -- and maybe even just sit in bed all day... IDK about this last part, was just what I read.

Why do you guys think heroin is so ""bad"" for its users? It's so much like pain pills, outside of its illegal status, life's-like-a-box-of-chocolates effect (never know what u gonna get in a bag),and tendency to IV it over and over again -- word to Nelly and Tim McGraw.

Considering i'll be high. but am I technically even ""high"" since Im an addict and just using at this point so Im not sick? Whatever the case may be, I will not be ""clean and sober"" on Christmas, but i'll be putting up a good front. 

Ive always hated the holidays, especially Christmas. Its always been a shit day for me. no presents, no nice family dinners, no tree. My mom might have sucked in the Christmas cheer department, but my dad always made sure to enjoy the holidays. He'd get a big tree, decorate it altogether as a family, make sure there were tons and tons of gifts, have a nice family dinner, and make sure everyone was happy. This is my first Christmas without my dad and it sucks. But on the bright side, my mom has changed a whole lot and has become an actual mother figure and seems to be much happier. 

Fast forward to high school, I don't remember much. as much as Id like to blame it on the fact that maybe my Christmas' were never rememberable, Ive probably just fried my brain.  

Fast forward to ages 16-19 I was struggling. This is when my heroin addiction started becoming a real problem for me and everyone in my life. I don't remember much. Don't know where I was for the holidays or who I was with. I did spent a Christmas or 2 or 3 in rehab, along with a few Thanksgivings. 

Fast forward to 20-22, I was pretty much homeless. Hopping from a friends house, to a hotel, to my car. I remember sleeping in my car in the middle of winter with snow on the ground! Being ice cold with one small blanket, waking up with frostbite, contemplating how to get my morning fix. 

Fast forward to the last few Christmas', they have all been a total bust. 3 years ago, I was stuck in a hotel room, alone, no family, no gifts, no cards, no dinner, hell, not even a ""Merry Christmas"" phone call or text. The Christmas after that, I was living in what I guess you could call a ""trap house"" - no heat, no electricity, no running water. Just a few mattresses and a couch. Just a place to lay my head at night and get by. Again, no family, no gifts, no tree, no cards, not even a text or phone call. 

Last year for Christmas, things were better, things were looking up. It still wasn't the best, but my living situation was way better. Had an apartment with my boyfriend, always had food, always had clean clothes, a shower, a tv, hell, even a playstation I never pawned (and still have might I add.) I had put up a Christmas tree while jamming out to holiday music. I might've even baked some sugar cookies! But still, the family was distant. I woke up that Christmas morning, starring at the fancy tree I decorated, with no gifts underneath and no family around. 

Fast forward to this Christmas, things are getting better. its the 22nd and I still haven't bothered to put up the tree yet, maybe Ill do that today, but I might be lucky enough to spend the holidays with my family this year. My mom reached out and invited me over for Christmas. What a relief. What a gift on its on. Getting to spend Christmas day with my mom, step-dad, little brothers and grandparents. Getting to see the tree in the house. Getting to watch everyone open up their presents. Getting to see my little brothers get all excited over their new toys. Getting to eat a home cooked meal with everyone. Im grateful this year, and excited. It might be the first Christmas in a very, very long time that I'll actually enjoy. Family is what its all about.  This year, Christmas will be better

Either way, it truly is, a gift on its own, to be able to spend the holidays with family. Never forget that. Just a reminder to be grateful. Things could always be worse. This year, Im grateful my mom invited me over on Christmas day. ",1513960262.0

This is kind of a fucked up topic, but I'm wondering what your thoughts/experiences are: I am of the opinion that opiate use kinda saved my life in a fucked up sort of way. Can anyone else here relate?

**Just want to note that I am in NO way endorsing the use of opiates to treat depression/suicidality.**

    personal story time    

I used to be extremely suicidal/self-destructive. Constant thoughts of killing myself from around age 12-20. Was on a variety of antidepressants, ADHD medication, etc which would work for a few months and then stop. Had several suicide attempts when I was younger. Nothing too dramatic but a few examples are:

- I'd stand on a chair with my head inside a homemade noose, wiggling the chair back and forth for a few hours, trying to work up the nerve to kick it out. 
- Lock myself in a washroom with a liter of vodka, do some bong rips, and start carving up my wrists/arms with a razor blade. Stop when I either fell asleep or got bored.
- Overdose on benzodiazepines and alcohol.

At that point in time I had no desire to keep living but also no real motivator for *not* trying opiates. So I spent a bit of time doing some internet research and decided to cop some Oxy80s. Sniffed 20mgs of it, turned on some Sigur Ros, and by the time the experience was over, I felt I had a reason to live.

And this actually was my reason to live for several years thereafter. Of course I ended up a IV heroin/hydromorphone junkie, but I also managed to put myself through + graduate college, cultivate a group of non-using friends, and get a decent job all while hiding this from people around me. Even ended up getting sober for two years before willfully relapsing.

About a year ago, I texted my dealer to buy some heroin (she had a rare source for good, unadulterated heroin for several months). She told me no problem, but there's one thing, the dope I'm buying has something called carfentanyl in it. At that moment I had a sort of awakening; there was no amount of persuading me, I was not willing to take the risk in buying that shit. Logical follow up to that is I actually valued my life now. Or at least I valued it enough to want to make sure I don't die, because heck, that means no more bangin' Ds.

Got on Suboxone as of that incident a year ago. Cut off all using acquaintances and dealers. Didn't relapse.

Looking back now, I'd argue that whatever suicidality that used to exist in me has been pretty much snuffed out by opiates. In a fucked up sort of way, they saved my life.",1514086948.0

Hey all you handsome & gorgeous people,

I know some people love this time of year. Getting together with family, good food, ect. On the other hand, it also sucks for a lot of people. I'm one of those people that is not a huge fan for many reasons. But that's for another day! I usually have terrible luck with anything/everything. Well not today (or last night!)

I was at work, busting my ass as usual. I'm a waitress and around holidays we get super busy. Well I had this adorable young couple who were super sweet. Their bill was $23.22. And as they handed me the checkbook they said ""Merry Christmas!"" I open it and start crying immediately. It was $100 bill in a cute glittery heart envelope thing. I couldn't believe it seeing as I was hoping for a $5 tip (or anything really)! This past week was kind of a pile a shit for me. Stressing over getting all my bills paid on time, christmas gifts, ect. So this really turned everything around. I hope you all have an amazing holiday, because you deserve it!😁💚

Also last night I got out of work, and got gas at like 2:30am. When I pulled up I noticed what looked like a bunch of money scattered on the ground. But thought, no freaking way not a chance lol I swear on my dogs life, I ended up finding $29 dollars in 1s and 5s scattered all around the gas pump (stripper money lol!) I know $29 doesn't seem like a lot. But it made my night😁😁 Seeing as I suck at life. Plus the extra $100 today was awesome. I always have terrible luck it seems. So moral of the story is, if your a good person, and have good karma coming your way.. It will happen when you least expect it. Thank JJ also, I know he had something to do with the last 2 days. Happy nods fam and Merry Christmas!!😘😘😊



TL;DR- I usually have terrible luck. But I got an awesome $100 tip when 20% was like $5. And I found $29 on the ground at the gas pump last night. So good JJ and karma will hit you when you least expect it (and need it most)😀",1514083676.0

CBT Therapy A3: *Daily Journals*

**WINSLOW, CHARLES F.**
(Male/25yrs.) Patient ID: 74299




**Entry 1**- Tuesday, 3:07 AM

My name is Chip. Short for Charles. I am in rehab. I hate it here. And I simply refuse to write in a diary for the sake of therapy. So, instead, I’ve decided to create what I will call a “tactical journal.”

You see, they don’t actually read this. All I need to do is show them I’ve written *something* every day and I get to keep my cigarette privileges. What these people don’t know is that each morning they’ll be glancing at my escape plans. 

I was coerced into coming here by my mother, who somehow got the doctor to 51-50 me even though I have no psychiatric conditions (other than substance abuse). I guess this is her last ditch attempt at “helping” me. The last thing I remember after being injected with narcan but before nodding back off again is her yelling at me, “YOU’RE RUINING MY LIFE!” 

Well, I admit, that isn’t entirely false.




**Entry 2** - Tuesday, 9:51 PM

The intake process was short and painless, with the seamless efficiency of an industrial meat processing facility. The white coats poked and prodded, got samples of all kinds of bodily fluids, and a cute nurse asked me more questions than I cared to answer about my drug use history.

She asked if I felt like a disappointment. That topic always feels like a gut punch. True criticism stings true. Even if it’s hidden within an innocuous medical questionnaire.

I’m tired. Time to hop in these scratchy sheets and get some shut eye. Need rest. Withdrawals start tomorrow.



**Entry 3** - Wednesday, 7:03 AM

They loaded me up on clonidine and seroquel last night so I was actually able to get some sleep. Woke up to what I thought was the cute nurse bringing me breakfast but turned out to be Elma the old one taking my blood pressure.

The detox ward is on the first floor and consists of 10 rooms with two beds each. Cinder block walls coated in a thick white paint, mismatched tile floors, a thick plastic window that cannot be opened, and perforated ceiling tiles. So, unless I can Shawshank through the wall, or Mission Impossible it out the roof, I’m not escaping through this room.

On another note, I’m happy to find out that they use buprenorphine (suboxone) here. They will induct me tonight after all the heroin is gone from my body and then titrate my dose down over the course of about a week. 

In the meantime, they got me on benzos for anxiety, clonidine for blood pressure, trazodone for sleep, acetaminophen for headaches, robaxin for muscle aches, and an anti-nausea med that I forgot the name of. Most of these will be discontinued by the time I move out of the detox section. The meds don’t compare to a heroin blanket but do provide some comfort.

Tomorrow I get off my blackout period, so I will be able to use the phone. I’m sure Pico Pete will be down to aid and abet my escape. Pico Pete is always down for that kind of shit.



**Entry 4** - Thursday, 4:46 PM

Induction went as well as I’d hoped, although I only feel slightly better. As my body acclimates to the suboxone, I need to stay as active as possible to keep my mind off how awful I feel. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to walk around the grounds today with a staff member, so I jumped on that with the intent of doing some solid recon work while I was out there.

I’ve broken it down into six main points:

1) The entire compound takes up about one residential block, no bigger than a football field 
2) It is surrounded entirely by a cast iron pointed fence about 8 feet high
3) Motion sensing flood lights are positioned about every 20 feet along the fence
4) There is a walking path that follows the entirety of the interior of the gate
5) Two buildings on each end, and a small courtyard in the middle. There is also some sort of greenhouse on the far side, adjacent the courtyard
6) There are cameras mounted on each of the four corners of the fence and two on the main building facing the courtyard

It appears the main building is simply the detox ward on the bottom (where I am) and the dorms upstairs. The upstair level is split in two by the stairwell, creating an east side and a west side. The second building is much smaller, and consists of the kitchen, dinning hall, and offices. Courtyard has a smoking patio, a few sun bleached benches, some outdated exercising equipment, and an inoperable water fountain.



**Entry 5** - Friday, 10:01 PM

Tonight we had what was presumably meatloaf with coleslaw and peas on the side, with enough Sriracha sauce to dissolve a human body.

After dinner, I talked to my mom on the phone for the first time since I got here. She went on and on about how there have been a recent spike in overdoses since I came in. A batch of heroin going around that is giving people severe allergic reactions. And how the police and hospitals can’t keep up. She claims they are running out of narcan, which I don’t know if I believe. I told her not to worry herself, that it’s just sensationalist media doing their shtick.

I failed to mention to her that I’m planning on escaping this hell hole. Cravings are getting stronger. Need to fix that. Been dreaming about it in my sleep.




**Entry 6** - Saturday, 10:30 AM

Currently, I’m experiencing relatively mild withdrawals, E.g. goosebumps, restless legs, apathy, and insomnia. Oh, and the ever-persistent crushing anxiety of course, but that’s a given. All things considered, my body is adjusting to the subs well, and most of the physical symptoms are on their way out. Of course, as they begin to reduce my dosage, some of them will return. 

Still haven't met my roommate yet. His name is Ben apparently. He’s been asleep since I got here. I’m going to guess he’s coming off meth. Feeling pretty jealous of the meth withdrawal right now. I think he must have been a football player because he’s huge and keeps calling out plays in his sleep.



**Entry 7** - Saturday, 1:14 PM

From spending a good deal of time in the hallways, I’ve noticed that when an employee or a delivery guy needs to get in the building the attending staff will grab a set of keys with a teddy bear keychain. It hangs on a hook near the medication window and they use it to open the side gate. I need those keys.

The staff in detox mostly consists of two orderlies, a nurse, a case manager, and a doctor that comes once a day. My case manager is Doug and he is a douchebag. The orderlies and surprisingly laid back and the friendliest ones of the bunch.

I’m starting to find this whole journal thing rather cathartic.



**Entry 8** - Saturday 9:22 PM

Today around dinner time, a girl ran into the dinning hall and started going psychotic. She was out of her fucking mind, and clearly in heavy withdrawal from something. She had no idea what planet she was on when the orderlies were yelling at her to stop clawing at them. She must have bit her tongue or something because blood was flowing from her mouth. It was quite the scene.

Eventually they tackled her ass to the ground and carried her off. Most people didn’t even look up from their food as this was going on. I guess this is normal in here.

I’ve been to a few different rehabs but none like this. There are of course some obvious differences between lockdown and at-will rehabs, like the inability to leave when you want, higher security, and stricter protocols. But then there are some smaller, more nuanced differences.

For example, there are no sharp things anywhere. From the cutlery, to the bathroom counter, to the bed frames, there is nothing with an edge. Everything is specially made with the intent of being suicide proof. Apparently people can get pretty creative when they want to off themselves.

Also, the attitude of staff is slightly different. Less personal attention. Most clients are numbers. I wouldn’t be surprised if their HR department recruits directly from the DMV.

I’ve also noticed that lockdowns seem to have quite polarizing behavioral effects on clients. It seems to go one of two ways for people. You either accept your fate, become a beat dog, lower your head, and do your time. Or you freak the fuck out and rebel at all costs. There doesn’t seem to be a ton of middle ground there. Which is why I need to get out before I’m forced to face that decision.

My legs won’t stop moving and my skin feels like itchy carpet. Time for meds. Tomorrow is a big day, need to make a test run for my escape. So I need sleep.

[holiday shitpost],"I got here, where my family lives, yesterday. First, I met my little 16yo brother who doesn't talk to my mom and waited with him for my dad to pick him up. I'm pretty worried about him. He rather smokes weed than spending time in school and he doesn't even try to keep up an act. It really weirded me out how much he identifies himself with this whole gangster shtick.
He's going to spend the holidays with our dad and his new family. 


Haven't seen my dad in 8 years before yesterday. He never returned my calls, letters or presents after our last big fight 8 yes ago. After I spilled out the words I carefully laid out in my head, saying that we all grow up and hurt people without meaning to, my father only replied that he never hurt anyone. In general, he didn't listen to anything I said, never apologized for leaving or anything. So I left, saying that if he didn't want me in his life he didn't need to pretend to. He's just emotionally incapable... Then we visited my grandfather (my grandparents are separated too). I know that he doesn't think I should have told on my uncle who molested me for the better part of my childhood into my teen years. He told my mother that it shouldn't be a big deal. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Because I did keep my mouth shut for 10 years. And I still don't know if it hasn't been better to keep pretending it never happened. The only thing that came of opening up is that my mother doesn't talk to her little brother, my grandparents being heartbroken about their youngest son and him still not being in jail. Even though I had to give my testimony twice to the police. 



Didn't take any dope with me and went on a speedball binge before coming here. So I'm kind of sensitive atm anyways. I wish I had an intact family. And I wish I had something to knock myself out. At least I'm good with my mother and my 2 little sisters. Ain't much. but there are people who have less, I know. Still, when I see how other families come together with all the uncles, aunts and cousins and how they just stick together as a family, such an envy comes up in me. Envy is a useless sentiment and I'd rather replace it with being grateful for what I do have, but right now I feel like a little girl, aching for a drama free home. But with my family there's drama around every corner. My mother is sick and will die eventually before her time and I'm a fucking heroin addict.

I'm long past partying and now live in a wealthier community with my family. 

Past two weeks, my car has been broken into. The first time, they emptied my glove box, threw everything on the floor. I keep nothing in my car, but they didn't even take my spare change? And they didn't try to hide the break in either. Left the contents all over the floor, the seat reclined all the way back????, And all the doors ajar. 

Second time was broad daylight. Did I mention I love adjacent to the police station and all the cops also park in my parking area?? This time they just left all the doors wide open, assuming because I had nothing to steal. 

Now, before the obvious is asked, no I don't lock my car doors. A broken window with a deductible would cost me more than whatever they could steal from me. Which is nothing because I don't leave shit in my car. I'm not worried about the contents in my car or even the car itself, so....

So my question is this... Why would my seat be reclined all the way back. Why wouldn't they take the spare change. And why leave all the doors ajar???

Suboxone, MMT, AA, work for some.
Severe addiction and especially with growing problem in US. Life expectancy rate hasn't dropped in one year since 93 aids problem, hasn't dropped two consecutive years since 60s.

If they want to help, HAT. All studies show. Only side effects from long term heroin use, minor constipation, dependence, no nuero issues. Overdose, impurities in drug, no money, etc etc all a function of an illegal system that forces people to go to black market. If HAT was a reality like in Switzerland , Netherlands, UK, Belgium etc lives would be saved and people would could contribute to society. We live with a government that treats people like scum instead of humans.

Check out the PDF. People have asked me what help I'd seek in a free country. Here is the answer this isn't about getting high this is about being around doctors and humans that understand the addict brain and HELP not HATE.

Wish there was a way to get funding and trials started and federal law changed or many more will die. AA, subs, MMT doesn't work for me I know this will and would help me be a productive member of society. I wonder how visas work and they let US Citizens in. I've travelled to Europe but not for something like this, please read short PDF.

It's super dangerous for one, and I think it ruins the opiate. All the positive energy that opiates give you are totally ruined by Xanax, and you just end up passing out and doing nothing. I have seen Xanax turn some close friends into absolute drooling idiots that steal more brazenly than any junkie I have ever known. I feel like Xanax destroys way more lives in way worse ways than any other substance I have seen people addicted to, makes them much less functional as well. With opiates it is possible to behave normally and not appear high (unless you start nodding in front of people), but Xanax just makes people into dumb, blacked out, drooling, mumbling fools that can't be trusted to behave with any restraint. I have had them before, but I just can't stand them, they make me feel so slow and stupid. They ruin good opiates. Am I the only one here that feels this way?

I've been taking at least 30mg hydrocodone (norco) for back pain and an all-over-my-body muscle pain that no doctor can diagnose.  My morning ritual was to take 15-20mg in the morning, then 10-20 more during the day.  48 hours ago I decided to just stop.  The back pain is a 7, the muscle pain is a 9, but I wanted to see if I could do without it.  Just taking massive amounts of Advil now.

In the last 48 hours, I have wanted to choke multiple people.  Dropping my son off at school, I almost punched another parent who decided to stop in the middle of the fuckin street to drop their kid off, causing me and many other people to almost rear end him.

Then I had to go to a government office yesterday to file some standard paperwork.  After spending 45 minutes going from window to window, the last station tells me ""oh, we can't take this, you'll have to call this number and get it corrected.  Sorry.""  WTF bitch, the 6 other minions that looked over my paperwork couldn't have told me that?  I wanted to choke her out.  I'm not normally that violent.  I don't know if it is the lack of Norco or that I don't see people this stupid who have lived past 3 years old.  BTW, I now have to spend about 2 hours redoing paperwork, do a few other steps that will take me another 2 hours, and pay about $100.  All because another government agency messed up my paperwork.  FUCK!

My son had his last day of 5th grade yesterday (before Christmas break).  I told him ""don't forget your math book so you can study over the break"".  I went over this with him yesterday morning.  Told him to put it in his backpack when he gets to school.  The little shit forgets it.  FUCK!

Now I am off to the mall for a few last gifts for Christmas.  I'm hoping I don't run someone over, three times.  

Anyone else experience this?  I remember when I took a 10mg Norco, I would be happier than normal for a few hours.  I'm not on any other prescription or illicit drugs.  I am so wanting to take 20mg of Norco, an Ativan, and drink a bottle of Fireball and just tune out.  ",1514047099.0

Its been exactly 30days sober for me. For those who do not know ... I have major chronic pain problems including chronic pancreatitis, a metal plate in my neck, and fibromyalgia.

I accidentally got off the opiates exactly 30 days ago when I ran out of my script and money on a weekend. It started with a make it till Monday attitude and snowballed from there into today where I am 30 days now. 

I went through 10 days of withdrawals after coming off a 60mg average daily habit of oxycodone. Although I could easily tolerate 120mgs in a day if I wanted to. 

I currently live in a daily 4-7 pain score but i rather do that now than ever go through 10 full days of withdrawal symptoms. Maybe because its fresh in my mind but I hope to never forget how awful those 10 days were.

Love,

Dori_88

I havent been on reddit for a month or two. Regardless....my life was going great. I had maintained a steady and stable for 8+ years. Had a car i was 'almost' done making payments on. And was able to support my habit while keeping it in check and making sure i didnt fall behind financially. 

3 weeks ago it all came crumbling. And boy when it rains it fucking POURS. 

I was a delivery driver for papa johns. Was the lead driver with the most hours working 6 days a week. One night i was out on a delivery. At a stop light. Light turns green. One second i had a great car. One second later the car was a crumbled totalled mess. Some asswipe decided he didnt want to stop at the red and tboned the fuck out of me. Bye bye car. Bye bye job. Bye bye money. Im still waiting on the insurance but the problem is the reverse equity on the car. Sure, the insurance pays the value of the car...the shitty part is i was upside down a few grand. Thankfully i have gap insurance as well...but all that does is pay the difference so your loan is fully paid. That still leaves me with no ride. And no job. Not wanting to deal with WD's i worked it out with my boss. He brought me on as a manager. This lasted for 2 weeks. And then he fired me. Before the accident my schedule before was 4pm-1am. Id stay up till about 5-6am...wake up around 3 and go to work. During the 6ish years i was with the company i never once no called no showed. I had been late once or twice but nothing horrible. Not a single write up. I ended up with a morning shift and accidentally overslept. I was scheduled to open at 10... woke up at 11. Looked at my phone and saw 5 texts all from my boss. They went something like this. 

10:15 ""Where are you?""
10:17 ""Why arent you at work""
10:17 ""im not dealing with this past today if you dont get to work youre gone""
10:18 ""you know what youre gone. Dont bother. Bring your key ill have your check monday""

I honestpy cpuldnt believe it. So much so that i WALKED all the way to work with the key thinking that id still have a job if i showed up. But nope. He actually fired me. Idk if he was having a bad day or what but...idk. i just feel like a piece of shit now. Its just shit because people think all this bad shit is happening to me because im an addict and its so not fucking fair. I want to scream in their faces about how fucking hard i busted my ass for thr last 10 years to make it work. With no help from a god damn single person. And now everyone wants to come in point fingers and judge me. And just more icing on the cake...my aunt found she has stage 3 lung cancer. Gave her 2 months to live. And my grandpa is in the final throahs of dementia. So yea. Merry xmas.

Im going to rehab tuesday because i cant deal with going CT when my life is as fucked up as it is...

I have run out of the Codeine I brought (from my OTC country).

I have a /shitload/ of Bromazepam, alprazolam, tetrazepam and hydroxyzine over here, which provide very nice, mildly euphoric indulgences but I am still buzzing for some more opioid goodness.

I have around 30mg~ of morphine I plan to boof rectally (searching for a method, will probably buy an oral syringe).

**But** I also have an abundance of tramadol.

The (**Potential**) Issue: I am taking Zoloft (Sertraline) as part of my anxiety treatment. Given I get high from Codeine and low ish doses of Morphine could I pop like 75mg of tramadol, having skipped my sertraline dose for today and have a good time? Sertralije has a 25 hour total elimination time, so i will have no SSRI in my plasma, granted SSRIs raise the basal serotonergic environment but a reasonable (75-100mg dose) of Tramadol would likely result in an inconsequential serotonergic rise given the lack of SSRI. Furthermore given I metabolise Codeine splendidly and Tramadol utilises the same pathway (to the more potent and more typical o-dsmt) I believe I could achieve a solid high. Maybe supplement with a bit of the Morphine.

I have read plenty of accounts saying the combo is perfectly fine and accounts saying it isn't, so I presume a moderate amount would be fine?

I've been using on and off IV for 3 years now.  

I lost my best friend to an OD about 6 months ago while I was detoxing after my girl called my folks. He was the first person I knew who fucked with H and he gave me my first rig. I've lost 3 years to this shit but for some reason all I wanna do is get loaded. Ive been to inpatient and outpatient aswell as sub matinence which I really think was more effective than Vivitrol. I even lived in a halfway house for 6 months. 

While there's a lot of benefits to being sober I'm constantly dealing with cravings and generally just feel depressed and anxious all the time. I have everything I could want right now, a nice place to live, a really good job in my field of study, a girlfriend and my family trusts me again. Even with all that I still just want to throw it away. I'm basically just doing this to appease my family and not for myself. They'll know if I skip my shot since the clinic is in a very small town and my aunts a drug counselor, so she knows the doctor. I've even thought about getting the naloxone implant in replacement of the Vivitrol injection and then having it secretly cut out.

I've been tempted to ask to my doctor to get back on subs but I'm not sure he would let me since I'm opiate free. I just don't know what to do, Vivitrol isn't helping with cravings. I'm just wasting everyone's time. All I hear is how good I look and how proud everyone is of me but deep down all I wanna do is get fucken high. I know I'm not done using so why delay the inevitable? If anything having my receptors blocked makes me think about using even more. I don't see how I'll ever transition off of Vivitrol and live a normal life. 

Sorry this post is kind of all over the place I just need some words of advice.

I recently deleted my last account to get away from it all - because I'm the type of person that finds temptation rather than strength in seeing what everyone else is doing - but I came back because I've been thinking a lot over the last week and realized that we can do it.  Whether that be stay sober for good, stay sober long enough to get things that have to be done done, or just stay sober long enough that it doesn't ruin relationships with our friends who also use - we can do it.


I've run into a ton of caring, intelligent, and unique people on here who have done so much more for me, a random internet stranger, far more than anyone in any other online community, not to mention most people irl, has ever done.  We're all good people, no matter what we've done at some point or another. And anyone who is reading this post is lucky enough to have at least one more day ahead of them to make things right, whatever that may mean to you.


Anyway, I'm *a few* drinks in now, because lord knows I can't be sober for good, but after making it through acute wds I'm gonna try to stick to alcohol and weed from here forward, two things that I have been able to regulate much better than opiates throughout my life.  Don't get me wrong, am I gonna never feel the pure bliss that we all love ever again? I doubt it.  But I am resolute in saying that in 2018 I am no longer going to push my luck by putting myself into situations that I have no control over, because I fucking hate that and I've realized that over the past while I've been doing it to myself.


I know I didn't have much of a cohesive point here but I just wanted to share my thoughts and let you all know that I'm thinking about you on this Christmas Eve, and although I'm usually not the religious type, I'll be saying a prayer for all of us tonight.

**Entry 16** - Wednesday, 6:43 PM

Apparently the cook didn’t show up to work today, so someone from staff made us mac-and-cheese with fruit cups on the side for dinner. It was actually quite an upgrade, so I wasn’t complaining.

At meals, Ben and I usually sit with a younger kid, about 18 years old, that goes by “Spooner,” not sure what his real name is. Skinny, pale, nerdy type. Dude is straight up a chemistry genius. He manufactures designer drugs in his mom’s basement. He’s like a drug addict savant.

But once he got hooked on his own fentanyl the game was over for him. Started selling more and more on the darknet to fund his habit. Made good money up until recently. He claims that almost overnight a new fentanyl analogue out of eastern europe has flooded the market and he has yet to be able to reproduce this specific variation in his lab, and no one wants his old stuff. 

At one point, he thought he had it right and dosed his little sister’s pet hamster to test it. It ended up freaking out and started eating itself. I guess killing his sister’s hamster was the last straw and his parents shipped him off to rehab.



**Entry 17** - Thursday, 8:55 AM 

Today is last day on subs! I’m a little scared to be honest. There are times when I’m all about sobriety and then there are times when I just want to get high. Right now I’m feeling good about staying clean but we’ll see how I feel tonight.

Classes are still cancelled. Only time I’m out of my room is for meals. The halls seem to be getting emptier, almost no staff around. Escape planning has been on somewhat of a hiatus, as am actually starting to enjoy myself here a little bit. But I believe my window of opportunity has presented itself with the current lack of staff situation. My recon work has been over for a few days now, and I think I came up with a plan of escape last night. 



**Entry 18** - Thursday, 7:23 PM

I’ve been trying to find Chloe in the meal hall. I really want to get her number before I leave. But because I only know her by her voice it’s been difficult. 

About halfway through dinner we heard sirens right outside, and a lot of commotion from the section 8 housing across the street. Been hearing more and more of that the past couple days. I think that’s why they have two more security guards and one more orderlie on duty instead of just the usual guys today. Still less of the treatment staff though. 

Tried to call Mom after dinner but she didn't answer again, starting to get a little worried about that. It’s not like her. Going to head to the room and see if Chloe is back yet.



**Entry 19** - Friday, 2:04 AM

Waited up next to the air vent until 2 AM but she never responded. Hope she's alright. Going to try and get some sleep now. Also, feeling pretty good for my first day off subs. Spooner says the sickness doesn't really start until a few days after you stop, due to its long half-life. So I'm not out of the woods just yet.

More importantly, tomorrow is the day. Finally going to go ahead with my plan. Everything is in place. It’s now or never.



**Entry 20** - Friday, 7:05 AM

So, I woke up this morning to the clicking and buzzing of the intercom system at six in the morning. After a minute of the white noise, a voice that sounded familiar boomed over the PA. 

I can still hear it clearly in my head:

*“Good morning residents. Please note, that all private sessions and group classes remain canceled indefinitely. Please remain in your rooms until further notice. Do not leave under any circumstances. Meals will be brought to you directly. That is all.”*

Well, that announcement confirmed my belief that the tension I’ve been feeling over the past couple days is real. Something is wrong. I don’t know why they are being so cryptic about it. The uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach doesn’t help much. But that part is probably more just a symptom of being nervous about my escape tonight.



**Entry 21** - Friday, 7:46 AM

I wanted to check on Chloe, ask her what she thought about the announcement. So, I put my head up the vent, but before I could say anything I heard a soft whimpering coming from the other side.

I cautiously called out her name and the whimpering stopped. I heard her sniffle her nose, and she finally started talking. It almost broke my heart to hear her voice like that--meek and trembling. She was clearly shaken, and I can’t fucking believe what she told me. It makes my blood boil even thinking about it.

Turns out, last night when she was returning to her room from dinner, two orderlies, case manager Doug, and the head physician were in her room, waiting for her. When she opened the door and walked in, they subdued her against her will and took her to an office out past the courtyard.

They strapped her down to the bed and questioned her for over an hour. The doctor claimed she has been acting strange and not eating enough. He accused her of sneaking drugs into the facility and was trying to force a confession out of her. He kept asking her basic math questions for some odd reason.

They ended up drug testing her, taking her blood, urine, and saliva. It wasn’t until the fifth test came back clean that they finally gave up. They escorted her back to her room and let her know that she’s going to be transferred to a different facility in the morning.

And that was it. They locked the door, from the outside, and left her in her room.

I wanted to sit there and keep her company, try to comfort her, but she wouldn't let me. So I sat there by the vent until I heard her snores and then got up in bed and started writing.



**Entry 22** - Friday, 12:37 PM

It’s well past noon now, and no breakfast or lunch has been brought to us now. I seriously hope whatever is going on doesn’t fuck up my plans. All I’ve been doing is pacing around the room. 

Thankfully, it sounds like Chloe is still sleeping soundly. 

It’s been quiet on this end, but I can hear noises from the detox ward. Like doors slamming and sounds of loud objects being moved around maybe? But it’s absolutely silent on the west end of the upper floor, which is somehow more worrisome. That side should be packed like a meat locker. It was completely full when I moved out of detox, which is why on I’m on the east side. As far as I know, Chloe and I are the only ones over here. And although our rooms share a wall, they are back-to-back, so we don't share the same hallway. Which means I cannot go check on her. 

A few minutes ago I tried to go out to the hallway to look around but my door was locked from the outside. That did not help settle my nerves.

What kind of fucking bunk ass rehab is this? This has got to be illegal, abuse or something. I mean, I have heard stories about shitty rehabs but I didn't know they could fucking lock you in your room and starve you. 



**Entry 23** - Friday, 12:55 PM

Someone finally came to the door. Very hard to write as I can’t stop my hands from shaking. The person at the door kept knocking and trying the handle. I kept yelling that it’s locked from the outside. I took a peek under the door and saw a familiar set of worn-out converse shoes. I could tell it was Joey. 

He finally got the door open. It was Joey, but not all of Joey. His right arm was dangling by a tendon at the elbow. I immediately puked all over the door. I think he was in a state of shock because he couldn’t speak. He just kept moaning with a guttural noise and blowing air from his mouth, like he was lifting heavy weights.

I kept trying to ask him what was going on and yelling at him to run to the nurse’s office. I went out in the hallway to take him there myself, but he grabbed me by the neck and started clawing at my throat. Most of his fingers on his left hand had been scraped down to the middle knuckle and all that remained were bloody nubs covered in splinters and dirt. 



It seemed like the fucking idiot was trying to bite me. I could barely move, I was frozen. He looked horrifying. His pupils were dilated to the point that his eyes were nearly all black. His skin was ghostly pale with goosebumps all over like rough sandpaper, all of the hair on his body was standing straight up. 

I tried to throw him off me but he was drenched in sweat and I couldn’t get a good grip on him. I finally was able to kick out his feet and I dove back into the room. Before he could get into the room I closed the door and shoved my dresser over, holding it shut. 

I have been yelling for help but no one has come. Chloe is awake now. I don’t know what else to do, the only thing that is helping me calm down is writing in this stupid journal.

I can still hear him out there fiddling with the door handle. It sounds like there might be another person out there with him now. I don’t know if he is in some sort of psychosis or what but I’m not going to stick around to find out.

I’ve had enough. I’m going to get Chloe and we are getting the fuck out of this place.

The first few began with a pint of 7.5/500 liquid vicodin. I experimented with different doses, 30mg hydrocodone being the highest, and they were all pretty underwhelming. I never got any euphoria, and I had to focus pretty hard to try and make myself nod out. 

A week or so after I finished that pint, I got my hands on a few 5/325 oxycodone. I took 3 of them, so 15mg oxy total, and I drank about 1oz of prometh with codeine syrup. From what I understand, oxy is stronger than hydro, but for some reason it didn't feel that way. Which is why I drank the 1oz of lean, to try and get higher. Again, the experience was pretty underwhelming. There was no euphoria whatsoever, and I ended up just falling asleep. 

Since then, I've only been able to get my hands on prometh with codeine syrup. It fucking sucks, I know. If I drink 2oz on an empty stomach, I can catch a decent nod, but on a full stomach, I've drank 3oz and felt nothing for hours.

I have been feening to get some roxy 30s for weeks, because I've never tried 30mg oxy and I think it could take me where 15mg couldn't. But they're soul crushingly expensive. Over $30 a pill if I want pharmaceutical shit, which I do. I'm ready to drop the dough and get 5 or 10 of them, but I just don't know if its worth it.

What do you guys think? If 15mg oxy is disappointing for me, will 30mg be enough to impress me? Are the doses that I've been taking just too low to expirience euphoria and good nods? Will the roxys do that for me?",1514172871.0

A few months ago I treated myself to a few ""stainless steel drinking straws"" for a few pounds from ebay. I cant recommend them enough! 

I have recovered residue from these ""luxury"" tooters by scraping, smoking directly (heating the tube and causing the resudue to vaporise. Be careful because its very easy to burn yourself!).

Just now I tried a new recovery method, alcohol wash! I dipped the tooter into 99% isopropyl alcohol and put my finger over the other end (to hold the liquid in the tube as i withdrew it from the alcohol). Shake it vigorously (cover both ends obviously) then dispense the liquid onto some foil. This was then gently heated with a lighter until all the visible liquid has evaporated, then let it sit for a bit longer to evap more. BE VERY FUCKING CAREFUL BECAUSE THIS SHIT IS HIGHLY FLAMABLE!! Even after playing around with the foil and evaping the alcohol, i went and put my lighter to the end of the tooter and big flames are spurting out!  Use a second tooter to smoke, dont use the first tooter until the alcohol has 100% evaporated. Test it with fire to ensure that its not going to blow up in your face before using it again. 

Anyway, long story short: get some stainless steel straws. Level up your smoking game.

Everybody knows that lean is over priced. Everybody knows you can get over a quarter of heroin for how much a pint costs. 

But if you like to pour up syrup then you shouldn’t be bashed on. It’s an opiate isn’t it? Codeine syrup. A non user could say the same thing about how much of anything else you could buy instead of $amount of opiates. 

Some of us know that if we iv’d heroin that we would get way more bang for our buck, but some of us like the experience of dropping the candy in the cup, pouring your soda over ice and cracking that seal, and turning that potion purple, the same way people are addicted to the ritual of crushing up a line or prepping a shot. 

This isn’t
 r/ivheroinonly it’s r/opiates with codeine included. You can get addicted to and feel euphoria the same way with lean that you experience with every other opiate. If you’re willing to pay for syrup and you want To pour up you should be able to show off and talk about it here, just like people show off bundles and loaded rigs.

Tldr at bottom 


My friend told me he had a Handful of fake 10mg hydros. Here is the kicker though; he thinks they are xanax or kpins.  That just doesn't add up to me.  So my tolerance to opiates is so incredibly high that I would never purchase opiate pains pills unless it was to help a friend out that needed them but would never purchase them for myself.  

So my buddy isn't a scientist or professional when it comes to identifing things just swears they weren't fent or opiates but that he truly believed they were xanax.  Well i happen to love benzos and quite honestly need them and thats truth not just addict reasoning.  Anyways I got him some perc 10s at cost  and instead of charging him a small fee to do it for him  he gave me a bag of these


So here is my question:  have you ever heard of someone taking benzo ingredients and making fake pain pills. I have obviously heard of the other way around and people making fake xanax bars by using fent but just never heard of this other way around. I want them to be benzo so badly but just can't find anything on the internet anywhere of people saying they got this combination. I feel like I know the answer is not going to be what I want to hear but fingers crossed 

Another friend of mine taste tested them because we can usually identify xanax and kpins based on taste but he said he couldn't put his finger on what these tasted like and both of them couldn't really identify what they felt like. 

Tldr. Have you found fake opiates that were actually benzos",1514163445.0

I was recently down in FL doing ok and managed to put together about 4 months then started shooting dope pretty heavy. I never even really used needles before i got to florida but i became obsessed with IV'ing. 

I used for about 3 weeks living in a halfway house but one night I managed to score some bars along with my dope and I guess i was way too fucked up and it was apparent. So the house manager came and you all know the drill I was asked to leave for 3 days and go to detox. 

So I went to detox which was pretty nice and got comfy with the subs and valium. Somehow word got out to my previous treatment center that I had relapsed and they wanted me to go back to treatment. I really didn't want to go cause I had a great job working with dogs and didn't want to give that up. Eventually I agreed to go up to PA to do an IOP and live in a recovery house. My decision is influenced heavily by the fact that if i did not continue treatment i would lose financial support from my parents which i rely heavily on.

After agreeing to go to PA my grandparents brought all my stuff to pack up and they brought my mail as well. I had forgotten i ordered 50mg of clonazolam and when i saw that package i managed to pocket it while they tech at the detox was patting down the rest of my shit. 

I have no idea what happened but I remember taking some in the detox then waking up in the hospital and i had apparently given the shit out to other people there so there was like 5 of us in the hospital and I just remember literally not being able to walk. I would stand up and collapse.

I got back to the detox and obviously i couldn't stay there so they transferred me to there other facility a few hours north of where i was. I finished that and came up to PA and have been here about 2 weeks.

Now I'm sitting in the house and nobody is here cause everyone went home with their family and it really sucks. My family is still supportive but I'm still alone. Not being able to use sucks too but im toughing it out cause i don't want to fuck up again. So i just wanted to reach out and say if anyone else is in a similar position please feel free to reach out and chat.

I hope everyone has a safe and happy christmas. Love you guys.",1514158791.0

I've tried opana er 30mgs and those actually helped pain pretty good, it just felt like it took almost 3 hours to help me out. Would asking for something short acting (ir) for when I first wake up and an xr to last through out the day?

**Entry 9** - Sunday, 6:00 AM

My roommate, Ben, who has been detoxing off meth, finally woke up after sleeping since Wednesday. I hadn’t even said a word to him after nearly a week of being his roommate until this morning when finally realized he had a roommate. For a minute I honestly considered he may have died in his sleep, but even in that case I would be happy to have have my own room so I let him be.

He seems cool though, dude is huge and used to play football in college. Built like a refrigerator and about as tall as a telephone pole. He’s got droopy blue eyes and some shaggy black hair. Got hooked on pain pills from an injury and it took off from there. I don't know how or why he switched over to meth but everyone’s got their story. He let me use one of his blankets because I’ve been freezing my dick off over here, so that was nice of him. Ben seems to be a great roommate so far.



**Entry 10** - Monday, 11:55 AM

Dickhead Doug, my case manager, wants me to write a “Dear John” letter. Which apparently is a letter I write saying “goodbye” to my addiction. Writing a letter to a semi-abstract medical condition sounds fucking retarded, so I’m going to write a breakup letter to my drug dealer instead. Here it goes:


*Burke,*

*What up man. This is Chip. I’m actually only a few blocks away from your place right now but I’m stuck over here at Pinecrest.*

*You were the best dealer ever. You always had shit, and it was always fire. And even though you didn't use, you always let me fix in your bathroom. Afterwards you would even let me chill on your couch for a bit. I really liked being high as hell and watching you feed your fish and telling me all about your gun collection, that was cool as fuck. Also, your cat was dope. Skittles is chill as shit and I liked when she’d sit on my lap and start purring. I really appreciated all that.*

*I loved what we had going. But still, what I didn't love was the hold your product had on me. I didn't love giving every penny I earned to you. I didn't love how I only felt good when I was coming to or from your house. I didn’t love being a willing prisoner. And for these reasons I need to say goodbye. I hope I never see you again. Say goodbye to Skittles for me.*



**Entry 11** - Monday, 7:32 PM

I have been here for almost one week now. Place isn’t too bad as far as money grubbing rehabs go. A member of staff took me on a walk around the grounds again. Upstairs they got a sweet common room with a big flat screen and a jenky ping-pong table, and outside there’s a rusted gym area--none of which I am allowed access to until I finish detox.

My days on the 1st floor consist of laying in my bed, eating, writing, and lounging on the sofa in the front atrium while watching VHS tapes on the colossal 32” tube TV. Been hanging out there a lot to try and get a feeling for how the staff operates--shift changes, meal times, personal tendencies, that sort of thing.

Sometimes late at night, if nobody else is around, the janitor will prop open the back door and smoke a cigarette outside. I timed him last night and he was out there for two and a half minutes. Going that route has some potential in its simplicity.



**Entry 12**  - Tuesday, 10:08 AM

Moved out of the detox ward today, over to general population (they get mad when I call it that). This was nice actually because I wasn't supposed to get moved out until sometime later in the week. But they told me I could finish my suboxone taper on the upper floor and hurried me out.

I don’t know if it’s just my rising anticipation to make my escape or not, but it feels like there is some added tension between staff and clients recently. Seems like they are suspicious, or nervous even. I do realize this is probably just all in my head though.

I have two more days of subs then im off it completely. I’m still on Ativan and clonidine which is nice.



**Entry 13** - Tuesday, 3:24 PM 

My new room is pretty comfortable, surprisingly. I don't have a roomate yet so I pushed the two twin beds together now I’m sleeping like a king. 

I have been scheming of ways to get to the teddy bear key ring. I need to figure something out in the next couple days while I still have access to the medication window. And now that I have access to other parts of the compound, I have also been collecting tools and other things I might need for my escape. So far, I have come up with a hammer, a phillips screwdriver, a keychain flashlight, and about 10 ft. of cable rope that I took from broken gym equipment. I was also able to talk my way into getting my small hiking backpack back from the front office to keep in my room.

Groups and classes got canceled today so I'm just chillin in the room thinking of getting high when I’m out.



**Entry 14** - Wednesday, 5:40 AM  

I woke up to a girl’s voice in the middle of the night. Got up and soon realized the voice was from the next room, coming in through the air vent. She was trying to get my attention. I was annoyed at first, but she just wanted someone to talk to. So I did. She turned out to be pretty chill. 

Long story short, her main thing was oxy and this is her first rehab. Her name is Chloe. She finally decided to get clean after her longtime boyfriend OD’d in her arms last week. But now she is having second thoughts. She agreed that Doug is a huge dick and is a creep. He spent most of the session bragging and looking at her tits. 

She said she likes to rollerblade, I thought that was rad in like an ironic kind of way. Anyway, We talked until the sun started to come up. She started snoring and, not going to lie, it was adorable to listen to. I’m glad she got some sleep.



**Entry 15** - Wednesday, 8:55 AM

I was sitting at breakfast with Ben this morning trying to scope out who Chloe was when a kid I hardly know came up to us and started freaking out. He was convinced his roommate was trying to kill him. Ben got up and scared him off. It was just a weird situation. He was on the verge of tears and looked genuinely terrified.

Ben said the kid is in rehab for spice and bath salt abuse, so his paranoia actually makes sense now. He’s the guy always smoking the American Spirit cigs out on the patio. He’s like a skater punk type dude. Wears the same thing everyday. Green hoodie, black skinny jeans, and a pair on converse that look like he’s worn all his life. It’s not at all uncommon to meet people in rehab who have fried their brains with their drug use. Anyway, going to have to keep an eye out to avoid him for now, I don’t feel like dealing with other people’s drama.

I'm 

For the record I know lots see the thread title and flock to the comment section without reading anything I wrote and saying how two partners using will never work and it's dangerous when getting clean and wanting an argument. I understand and know this. I have been to rehab like 6 times in the last 15 years. Been thru some rehab romances. Anyways I didn't meet this girl on drugs we met like only a few days after I got a POF after moving alone to a new city (NC is a terrible place dont go. Pretty much goes for SC alabama and well hell....anyways...she found me she's fine as hell we've been together 6 years I hid my dope use from her for a couple years (I traveled for work alot and she lived a good 45 mins away in a kinda bumpkin town so we started casual (ie not 100% exclusive unspoken)

The girl has seen me go thru so much considering we met at 22 when I was young and dumb and sloppy on purpose...rehabs jails halfway houses homelessness RICHES(had a couple good jobs)...when i use for a spell I pretty much hit rock bottom....clean up long enough to surprise everyone and actually accomplish shit...then the gorilla comes out of hibernation. Im sure alot can relate. It blows I started doing this in high school basically (got wds for first time senior year didn't IV for a good year tho after when in the dorms for my super accelerated 1 and 1/2 semesters of further education (this is the one thing I am consistently mad at that I can't get back.)

Anyways to the point if you go to the first post of this account long story short we lived in nola for over a year and moved to alabama this summer to get clean after a 14month bourbon st classy run. Its a miracle we kicked and yeah it was I guess more traumatic to her even tho I almost seized but no big deal done it a million times.

Only something else happened.

The light like never came back on in her. After about 6 years of LOVE BABY were like that couple probably with the PDAs I mean not trashy but I mean like everyone knew us as the couple who never faught like we were good for each other. Started sniffing a lil tweak here and there we both got jobs a week after kicking exactly almost at the same waffle house basically and yeah I'm not gonna justify it yeah Tina entered the picture which was never a problem for ne (loyal to down) but my girl just lost her father to it a couple years ago and he was always in and out prison when she young and I haven't met her only brother in 6 years because he's been in prison the whole time for ""shit"" that's what they call it (that's what it is) basically it's an issue for my girl KINDA like dope is (double screwed I guess) ANYWAYS

My babies light never came back on . she became friends with this just trashy young 20 something girl that worked at the restaurant with us for ONE DAy before she got fired....the girl that everyone talked shit about for being a bag whore....anyways they got to be close and my girl and me faught she started using behind my back trust was broken it got ugly and I wound up leaving alabama to move back to New Orleans at the end of this summer. With no phone no car only 14 dollars and a backpack full of clothes nowhere to go no nothing. And I was heartbroken.

I posted about going thru that a few months ago I was super bitter swear id never talk to her. I also started back sniffing dope (no iv didn't even crave it) daily and things were falling into place I was working renting a room making decent money miserable but I'm the fucking man. Dope just handicaps something in me.  But I got thru it....picked a habit back up....

Anyways I left alabama hearing rumors from our ice dealer ironically who wanted to bang her and had forever that she already had a new bf. All these rumors. He said She said shit that for 6 years before we never would have let touch us. At that time with her trying to live the trailer life with some slut meth girl choosing that over me. Basically shit to make me want to leave town asap (I literally chose to be homeless and penniless to get away from her asap. She became full time then like what I get flashes of now.

For some reason when we do even a little meth together we fight. Some of you will understand me when I say just because we are doing some drugs you may picture us as some zombies to the outside world but with me on that shit my line between functional and a mess is razor thin I am either able to work or if I shoot enough or smoke enough I can turn into a (harmless) carpet picking fapathon mess. So when I say do some meth together I do a line at work sometimes on the weekends never bring more than .3 home. I did a free line Friday night at work and brought home less than .08 prolly that she shot. Bought a 20 last night that was really fat I was geeked yesterday and bought a shard bubbler bong and a torch at the gas station and wanted to get a sack all day but the dude ghosted until 5am. For a 20. Tweaker dboy said the neighbors (he does live right in the heart of idk how to describe it it's where lil wayne is from) got my dudes house shot up like 10 times. Whatever I finally got to put 2 smaller than rice sized crystals into the bong and blew like 3 fatass clouds felt so good I grabbed my spoon threw like 4 or 5 rice crystals in....and that's when my gf walks in having woke up. We had like a normal 20 im talking half or more of the sack still and I guess I was so fucked up I let her start doing her thing (she packed a FAT ASS bowl and then wanted a shot) . anyways she did it all there wasn't even .05 left it was literally one hit.

That was my sack. I paid for it. I copped it. I was gonna do it all or split it with her...hell the lil shot she did Friday I gave her all i had which was less than a point which again I saved for her but she like demanded it. And when I called her out tonight it's ""no I didn't"" she will scream and get so defensive saying she didn't do that much....WHY....

Like. Arguing over a dub of some bottom teir nasty drug that I guess she has some issues with now because of her family and ""how it took her away from me during the summer"".

Now of course the dope sack is sacred. I mean if she water whips my shot (99% of our cops are together do it all right there together. Do this at least twice a day every day on and off for 4 years. I have caught her trying to run game on me with ""we each get 40units"" and then handing me a rig while she's already trying to hit with 60 in hers. Could be an accident I mean guys for years we didn't have these problems and I mean our scores are consistent my shots are all pretty much the same color or consistency.

Here's a big part of the issue. Shes always worked since we really got serious a few years ago (before she was kinda a country thot sry babe). Shes a knockout and she's charming and we live right by bourbon street hell unbelievably she still gets western unions she got one today actually from when she shot girled on bourbon last YEAR. Shes that good. But she's worked for 2 weeks since she came back to nola and she's been here months. She worked like two weeks maybe at a cafe but she ""couldn't deal w the bitches"" got a job like a month later she just started a couple weeks ago and got fired out of nowhere before she made it out of training. She was late a couple times right since being hired. She swears another waitress was jealous or something Idk....but I have been begging her to get a job since she got down here but idk HER LIGHT ISNT ON.

Shes been talking about needing to see a dr to get back on antidepressants but hasn't done shit about it just sleeps all day usually if she's forced to get up she just goes back to sleep after a shot and idk how to help her. She's always bounced back. She was the rational one for a long time. She has an appt. For a psych in 3 weeks but ofc I had to set it up. Gonna be up to 6 weeks possibly before her meds start working so pretty much gonna be sourpuss city some days for another three months.

I am not perfect. I get a little irritated these days but I'm not verbally abusive I just tell her having to support us and 2 habits is hard help me plz...she acts like what I'm doing isn't good enough anyways.

We are drug riddled obvuiusly. But Im ready to kick and get thru mardi gras after Feb and then head West which was my plan from the get go. Not trying to geographical cure myself I just don't love Dixie no more half of Motherfuckers here are retarded. I'm worried that if she gets anymore stress on her she's really gonna go fucking crazy. I know this is where you want to scream this is why junkie relationships fail but idk man this is my girl we are talking about. Shes obv hurting. 

Its hard to look at her with a straight face but she was screaming at me in front of Walgreens earlier drowning out the loud classical music they play out front to discourage loitering and it truly hit me man she's not in there. I thought when she got here after she slept a week straight she would be happy finally. Didn't happen. She screams how she's just gotta wait on the doctor and basically me supporting her 100% and both our habits really I'm not a nag like that i mean I tell her ass but I'm supportive isn't doing enough. Like that she wouldn't be so bad off emotionally if I wasn't so crazy. Like bitch your the one desperate for happy pills sitting on your ass 24/7 getting down and you got the nerve to tell me ""you think your superman and so good and your not"". I mean a part of me says her sad ass should go see how many better boyfriends she can get with the attitude and the dope and the meanness. She begged for forgiveness for losing her way and pushing me away this summer. Got it on pretty good faith from others too she swears she wasn't with anyone else and just using and got sucked in after the hard detox and to cope with us having problems blah blah blah she should be making this easy on me.
I have fully supported her for years before for long stretches I can be cool if you are sweet to me. I don't do bitching

Basically I'm dealing with a depressed fine ass junkie best friend supposed life partner who has tweaker tendencies and is more delusional than I thought.

I'm tired y'all. She just got a 200 w.u. for Xmas. She got a 50 one too today. My folks sent me 250 Friday. I wanna go to work tonight but don't have to She just ugh",1514144443.0

I was heavily addicted to prescription amphetamines and snorted 30's from time to time but I was never addicted to the 30's. A few days prior to the fateful Christmas morning I met my first heroin dealer in the Walmart bathroom. I was taking a piss when this tatted up thug lookin mofo came in and was on his phone talking about grams and selling this and that. I honestly thought he was talking about weed so I intruded and asked him if he sold weed cause I need a new plug. He said, ""nah man I sell heroin, you fuck with that?""  

.        . Na bro I don't fuck with heroin but I'll take your number down anyway. Worst decision I have ever made. Fast forward Christmas morning me and my buddy are snorting Adderall and smoking blunts when he asks me, ""you ever try heroin?""

.          . No but I know a guy. And that was that. We took our meesly $40 and hit up the dope man for the very first time. It was BTH and we had no idea what we were doing trying to smoke it lol. We probably wasted half of the dope just burning it trying to chase the dragon. Needless to say we got pretty fucked up and I loved it. To this day it's probably my best high I have ever had in my life. I fell in love right from the start. 

.         . Fast forward 5 years later and I'm still doing the shit and fucking my life up worse and worse with every passing year. Fuck you Walmart bathroom heroin dealer. Fuck you 19 year old me for being so nosy. I guess we get what we ask for.",1514143861.0

When I get to work (it’s a dark establishment inside), I’m having a hard time seeing my coworkers... just wondering if any of you homos experience the same? 

And when I got home, I discovered a new method of rinsing my cottons that’s AMAZING... well... amazing if you have the supplies. See, I live in a state where I can get whatever needles I ask for at Walgreens. One time I even tried, just for the fuck of it, to ask the pharmacist for a box of syringes and when he was ringing me up, I said, “Oh. And I’ll take two doses of Narcan.” Surprise to me... it worked! As it should, I guess... fuck it, if I’m gonna do it, lemme minimize the risk...
Back to the rinsing:
2 Lure Lock 1mL syringes
1 18ga Lure Lock needle 
1 injection syringe (your choice)
1 your favorite spoon. 

1: remove plungers from Lure Lock syringes. 
2: attach 18ga to one
3: stuff wet cottons into 2 Lure Lock syringes. (Bout 10 max for 1mL)
4: use injection syringe to fill up .5 mL
5: inject the .5 mL into the Lure Lock with the 18ga needle attached
6: push water from that syringe into the back of the other Lure Lock with the 18ga needle
7: push that water into your spoon
8: repeat as many times as necessary.
9: enjoy

I guess it’s possible that the money will never successfully transfer to homies bank.

Jails, planes, family functions...etc. I have a few. One of which sticks out though. I played hockey for my college when I very first started using. Back then it was pills but my habit got pretty high and at this time I was sniffing 6-8 oxy 30’s a day. How I managed to play hockey high on oxy’s (and actually play fairly well considering how banged up i always was) is another story in it of itself but anyhow...My team made it to nationals which was in Colorado. I’m located on the east coast, so this was about a 4-5 hour flight give or take. Me and another kid on the team who also was addicted went and bought a shit ton of 30s to hopefully portion out through the trip. But as most of you probably know where this story is heading, that didn’t happen. So here’s the scene... I ran out about two days before we left. Played our last game in minor w/d. Had to do team lunches and also my dad had flown out to see me play so i was with him. It was brutal. But nothing compared to the 2nd day. The 2nd day was our travel day back to the east coast. Before our flight which was at night we did a team excursion to a nearby ski village just to check it out and eat dinner. I was in full blown day 2 w/d. It was horrible. The plane ride was even worse. We got delayed on the tarmac for 2 hours. I had middle seat next to a screaming toddler and another lady who definitely should’ve been forced to buy 2 seats. Flight all together took us about 6 hours to get back. Me and the kid who I bought the pills with were both withdrawing horribly. I got the RL, sweats, stomach bile puke, and anxiety the entire time. We got well as soon as we got back but man I’ll never forget that trip. That was one of the worst wd experiences I’ve had. I’m sure it doesn’t compare to jails and stuff but still.

This is not my usual account, but I needed the advice of my people without certain other people knowing it’s me asking for said advice. Any way. I hope you all had a great Christmas/“insert holiday of choice here”. 
On to the point of the post!
So I suck at making friends, let alone friends who enjoy opiates like I do. I met this person in the land of the online. We started chatting, a joke here, some flirtatious emojis there. Then, upon discovering that this person and myself live very closely, we decided to exchange numbers and get to know one another via text/phone calls. After a few months of chatting/getting to know one another, we decide to meet up and share our “loot” or sample platter, if you will, of what we each get from our own prospective areas. Any way...long story even longer we kind of hit it off. We start hanging out when we got the chance, even if it was just a short lunch break. I have really come to like this person and I’m sure the feeling is very much mutual as this person has told me as much. Such as, they enjoy my company and want to see where things go. 
My question to you all is this: Would you get into a relationship with 
someone who was into opiates/other drugs like yourself? Even if you knew you both had good paying jobs that you were dedicated to, both of you had your own living quarters and forms of transportation etc. etc. 
Would you date another opiate enthusiast? 
Why or why not? 
Do you think it would last or end in disaster? 

Thanks for your feedback!

My family and I got into a pretty big fight (not about my drug use), and it pretty much blew everything out of proportion and ruined our day. Well it ruined my day. 

I'm just trying to savor those moments I get to spend with my grandmother. It's not often that she calls me by my own name anymore. Days like today when she does, I could sit by her side all day and talk to her and look at her and just listen to her say my name. My grandma is the only person who never lost faith in me no matter how bad things got for me. I truly don't know what I'm ever going to do without her... Or what I'm going to do when she doesn't say my name at all anymore. Right now at least she calls me her daughter's name, my aunt, she calls me my Aunt sometimes. I know soon she won't know me is anybody at all, but today she got to be home. She got to be at my aunt's house. I don't believe in anything religious really, but it really did seem like a miracle that she knew who everyone was today. Christmas has always been mine and my grandmother's favorite time. I'm afraid this may be the last year she'll remember it with me.

I'm trying to pretend this fight didn't happen. I'm trying to pretend everything is okay and that this couldn't ruin Christmas. I saw the disappointment in her face when my father and I left still arguing. I hate that I left that way, I hate that I left with that for her to see. I'll see her again. I'll see her hopefully the day after tomorrow again and I know I won't have to end things bad, not with her ever. I just feel bad because we had such a great day and ended on such a bad note. 

I will miss these days with my grandmother so much. All I had was a point to snort and a little Opana so I took everything I had and I just want to go to bed. I'm not high anyway. I could probably use some Xanax but really I just want to get high as fuck and I wish I had more drugs, shocking.

I really hope some of you had as great of a day with your family as I did with mine. It didn't end okay, but the time I spent with my grandma today was more important to me that I can describe and I hope that you all had something wonderful like that happened for you today, too.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7m40lc/when_you_have_money_and_nobody_will_answer_the/
This thread was my swan song I thought then my usual connect, who is pretty reliable, says he's eating dinner but has to go cop, himself, afterward and to meet him at his place around 6:45.

I show up at 6:45, his girl who is getting them is there, i give her $70 for 2 blue @ $35 each plus $10 for gas or coke or whatever winds her up and they all pile in the car and go for what I think is a 20 min drive there and 20 back, plus 10 or 15 niceties.

**5 fucking hours** I wait, in severe WD at someone elses house watching fucking Law and Order SVU over and over, all the while getting vague fucking updates like ""dude light. going to hardees now"" like that means *anything* to me. 

Turns out he doesn't have enough, has to drive 40 mins to someone elses house to *see* if they have more (oh yeah did I mention the first guys place wasn't 20 mins away but 45?!?).

So at this poing I'm like fuck it in the butt. I'm over it. But wait. THEY have my money. After 5 hours they say he can't get any more and come home at 11:30. 

Turns out they didn't quite end up with nothing, but just had to tow that particular line because of some other dude in the car. The down side is they only had 1 for me and only $30 of my original $80.

So, TL;DR: I waited 5 hours to pay $50 for one blue tonight.

I don't know if I'm happy that I got a blue or sad and pissed that I got shafted....I honestly don't know.

*Clarification Update* - The ppl that went running for me are friends I've known for years. Now, any junkie, (pill or skag,) is subject to shady behavior and the fact that they came back with just enough to give me one, but not two means I was lower on the totem pole than everyone else. In fairness, if you don't go on the ride to the connect, you're automagically lower on the pecking order than the ones in the car, at 30 degress, in winter, waiting in a Hardee's parking lot. I get that. So the more I thought about it the more I felt slighted but gave up, willingly $10 extra to the girl doing the running that wasn't getting anything for herself. That's a shitty ticket to pull - driving and waiting 5 hours to not get anything. I expected to pay $35 for the pill so I really paid $40 for the pill which is still high plus the $10 for my piece of mind.

Still, it comes to the same. 5 hours and $50 later all I got was one blue.

In contrast, I just picked up 7.5 percs (5 of them) for $7 each (still high but less than $1/mg) and feel 1000% better than I did last night after that blue.

But do any of you guys take adderall or any similar stims with your opis? I read all the time about how they will cancel each other out which might be true. I know whenever I take them, sometimes I feel great but when I really stop to think about it, I feel like the adderall almost always overpowers the oxy and I just feel energetic and don’t get dope sick. I do however love to mix Addys and benzos. Hell I mis them all it’s terrible. But I feel like the proper cocktail makes me take a whole lot less Oxys alone. 

Any actual scientific data to back up all the theories that stims will block or overpower opiates? Would be nice to know if I’m wasting a good amount of my opis when I take them with adderall to get some extra energy going. But I’m thinking even like a dose of 5-10mg adderall with 60-75mg oxy can’t overpower it. What do you guys think?",1514260626.0

And why that matters.","In the 'grand scheme' of things no one 'matters,' so really the only people we make a difference to/matter to are our friends and family. If that makes sense.

We should all think about how our actions effect those closest to us, even not thinking about how our potential suicide would effect them.

We should always try to be the best version of ourselves we can, especially to younger family members because, we may not think anyone could be so stupid, but they probably look up to us.

Our parents only want the best for us, it's why they pry when we think they shouldn't.  So much of who they are is wrapped up in who we are and who we will become.

In my experience, siblings are petty and vindictive and only want to find dirt on you so they can talk about you behind your back.  So we should be better than we are, just to spite them.

Our children are who we really need to be better for.  Sure, we can say 'at least we can be a cautionary tale for them.'  But in the end they are going to pick up traits from us, either through nature or nurture, so we shouldn't stack the deck against them.  Be a good example for them.  Suicide, even attempted, will fuck them up in ways we cannot even begin to understand...

We should always strive to better ourselves.  It not only makes us feel better about ourselves, but it makes the people that matter to us, and the ones we matter to, feel better about us.

Even if we don't plan on stopping our use of drugs, we can strive to be better than we currently are.  We can stop stealing from those we care about.  We can stop lying to them.  We can try to keep a job, even if it's just a shitty part-time job.  We can learn something new, or go to college.  If we can do some of those things, it can make everyone around us, ourselves included, feel better.  And when we feel better, it can make it easier to clean ourselves up if we ever choose to.

I wish i went tho i wouldnt leave because i was concerned about him but as i was walking to my room past the bathroom i heard a strange gurgling sound like he was trying to drown himself in the sink i immediately started pounding on the door but it was locked so i ran to my room snatched a bobby oin off the floor and started frantically bending it and trying to bite those little rubber tips off to picklock the bathroom door when i did i was horrified and my mind just went blank i will never in my life forget this for as long as i live there was blood everywhere on the walls the floor the mirrors the toilet the sink the tub he was standing infront of the toilet with the biggest kitchen knife we had just slicing both sides of his neck with such great force the sound the knife made cutting the tissue muscle and veins still makes me cringe typing this but all i could say was ""Dad No!"" I ran up to him and tried to take the knofe away from him but he yanked it back and just said to me no i need to do this at that point i already knew even if there were EMTs in that room he would still be dead he had made about 5-6 deep cuts on each aide of his neck so i just took a step back in shock and watched my dad just stand there slicing and slicing away i knew my time with him was running out by the second so i just looked at him through the mirror and said "" i love you dad"" he just looked me with the most regretful face ever and said ""i love you too Brandon"" and not evem 2 minutes later he had collapsed on the bathroom floor while i was just watching i was in so much shock i contenplated if i was going to wake up because this just had to be a dream it was too fucked up for it to be real life i called my mom and she called the police (i know some of you are gonna bitch me out for not caling the cops right away but i was only 17 in complete shock and had no idea what the fuck to do) after that moment i felt that my life couldnt get any worse because the worst possible thing that could have happened did happen....

Anyway, I recently (like a few months ago) made the switch to H because the pill game in my area has gone to shit. I met my plug through a friend who's been buying from this guy for a long time and he's a super chill guy. He's honestly the best plug I've ever had as far as reliability and timing and such. And he's fronted me a couple times when I needed it which was cool since I was a new customer and all. Price in my area is $100/bun but he's been really good about giving me a deal if I buy 5 at a time. The last couple times he's given me 5 buns for $325 and 5 buns lasts me and my girl the whole week (only enough to get actually high a couple times and then just staying good the rest of the week). I really appreciate the pricing break he gives me but the last couple of times I feel like the product has been subpar and the bags have been really light. Last week I actually got one completely empty bag and 2 others that doesn't have enough in them to make 1 full bag. And this week the bags were light and weak af. I'm not really sure if I should say anything or not because he's my only connect and I don't want to piss him off yea know? I also don't want him to take it the wrong way and start charging me full price for 5 buns because I can't really afford what I'm spending now let alone another $150- $175 ya know? And I'm pretty sure he's not the one breaking this stuff down and bagging it either because he has re-upped and sold to me within an hour or 2. All that being said, at what point do I mention that the product he has is weak or that I'm getting empty/super light bags?

It’s been weighing on my mind heavy but I still don’t think reality has set in that I’ll never be able to see or speak to him again. I’ve been clean for close to 2 years off heroin myself,  and that just makes this whole situation so much worse due to knowing the lifestyle and struggles that follow it. my cousin and I never talked about opiates or using, just about smoking trees and such, so I literally had no idea he was even going through something of this caliber. My uncle says over past 3 months he gained a bunch of healthy weight and even gave up smoking cigarettes & pot (which leads me to believe he actually was quitting or working towards becoming sober at very least, makes it even more sad).

The stories on here are incredibly moving, many posts extremely informative, helpful or funny. But one thing I've noticed is that most if not all users have a mostly negative relationship with opiates. I can certainly understand that and I have felt some, but very few of those negative effects. I was prescribed oxycodone for anxiety and after using it daily for a few months, I missed it very much when I moved to the US. For a few days I was really depressed, but I managed pretty easy with subutex, and just jumped off my last dose of that. I don't think opiates for anxiety are the right thing for me anymore. at least, not used more than max once a week for important occasions. I do think in certain people it can be a great option, though. Anyway, as the title of this post implies, what I'm looking for are your opinions on responsible opioid use. Do you believe it can be done? In your opinion, can people use opioids regularly, but responsibly like others use alcohol? I am convinced of it. While I'm not even sure if I personally can sustain such a pattern of use, I know that there are many people, most even, that never have any problems with drugs. On this sub most of the time however it seems like the general consensus is anyone who is using opioids is using them compulsively. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this. ",1514248986.0

We were down to the last few bags and this girl doesnt shoot h. in fact she never did it. she  likes shooting coke so we had the stuff out in two separate piles on the opposite side of the table. I mix my shot n set her up with hers. 


I go to the bathroom real quick and when I come back she hands me her shot and asks me to bot her up. I was barred out on like 4-6mg I was eating all day. so I wasn't like really looking att the shot and hit her.. 

Next thing I know she is like ""Whoa that is good. I feel really warm."" Then was like""I don't feel well."" her face turned completely motionless and expressionless. I immedaialty realized she took my shot. (I shooot 5-8 bags at a time). I FREAK out and she starts to like collapse (more like slowly laying down) so I throw her on the couch and her face turns blue. Shallow breathing..light pulse and not responding. I do a chest rub nothing. now her lips are blue so I tilt her head back n give severe rescue breaths. nothing. few chest compressions, slapping her face nothin.g I I openher mouth n her tongue is like curled back and blue. all of a sudden she starts seizing n gurgling. (this is like over 3 minute period). to top it all off I lost my phone earlier that night so I am panicked. I find her phone n remember if u hit the side button 5 times it puts it into SOS method.

I call 911 report the OD and they instruct me put her side and wait. At this point  toss all the needles, baggies, wipe the counter, and am like praying she is okay. Finally dispatch says they are downstairs- this is a luxury building in NYC but no doorman. So I run downstairs and fucking NYPD, EMS, and FDNY are there (8-9 people). I rush them upstairs and they pull me aside (NYPD.). 

I am watching them put an airmask on her and someone say (I think were going to have  a DOA). the NYPD really get intense and start asking me tons of questions, where she get it..howd she do it..ext. I say idk its heroin and she's odin that is lal that matters. They hit her with narcan,nothing.  I cant tell for sure how they did it but they hit her with narcan again..I want to say IV/IM administration. she pukes and wakes up. They tell me she was about a min from not coming back. she had 30% oxygen level and if she died I was getting charged with murder. 

I go with her to the hospital and they want to run all these bs tests. at this point she is fine. Now normally id say of course run the tests - they wanted to do a CAT scan and all this crap but she's uninsured son  was ike your going get like a 30k bill. it's your call. I wouldn't do it - she agreed. She lives only 5 blocks from the hospital. they gave us two narcan kits and we decided id stay with her and if anything changes we'd come back. mind you she also had a flight home in 4 hours.

Long story short she is fine but done with drugs. then she asked me to be her boyfriend after this was all done haa. she's a good girl and knows all about me soo I guess we are dating. plus she's rich.

OHHH and when the cops left her place they fucked up her bolt looks and we had to call a locksmith who charged 320 bucks to fix the door (the like door hinge broke). Girl is fucking loaded. she gave me her card to get cash and there was 21k in the account.

Well today I picked up from the guy who sold me that same stuff cause my regular guy was busy since it’s Christmas. 

Well I shot up in the same spot I always do and immediately felt a burning sensation I kept shooting it and once finished my thumb and index plus middle finger swelled up. I shot in my wrist again but I use the same spot all the time and it’s never happened with my regular dudes dope. 

Is it the dope or is it that I missed and shot in an artery? 

Also the tourniquet wasn’t on so it couldn’t have been that. 

Edit 1: id appreciate any help or advice. Thanks. 
I used to go through the guy who sold me that stuff a lot before but I stopped and go through my regular guy now. 
The dope when mixed with water looked like dirty water kinda. 

Edit 2: I just did another shot of backup dboys stuff in my hand and it immediately started itching and turned red like if I had a rash. I only did half the shot then finished the other half in my foot with no problem and no itching.

I sit here now with a sub under my tounge, in a nice warm house, I have a good welding career.. hell I'm getting paid to just sit around for the next two days.. but it wasn't always like that.  Just a few years back you would have found me out on the streets, pan-handeling, looking for anyone who felt sorry enough for me.  I used to get excited about Christmas and the week or so before it.  When it comes to pan-handeling, you cant beat it, people hand out exxxtra nice once it gets close to Christmas, especially if your smart enough to hang out by a huge shopping center or mall.  Not only do the crowds help.. but all the spending gets people feeling extra guilty and generous.  So anyways... probably about three years ago I was living in a squat on the north east side of town.  It wasn't proper as I didn't have it locked up or anything and just about everyone in the city had access to it, not to mention it was a burnout so it was gross as hell and depressing as could be.  However it was off the beatin path and wasn't so popular, people for the most part found some where to fix long before the came across this spot.  There where some nights where no one else would show-up at all and even though there were a few other regulars staying, for this part of town that is hard to come by. Any privacy at all is hard earned when your on the streets and it definitely is not something to pass up! believe it or not  people here wait in the bush's under the bridges along the tracks that run through the area, they wait while your prepping your shot and just as your ready to fix they jump out on you and hold you up for it! I even had a friend who says he had already drawn back blood when they snuck up on him, ripping it out of his arm before he could push the plunger down,  its never happened to me but I've heard the stories ;).  Well as I was saying, this particular house was a lot more quiet and this Christmas eve was no different it was early in the evening but I was already inside,  I knew there was a lot more money to be made but I was tired, I didn't want to be out.  I sat on my sleeping bag that I had sprawled out on the second floor right next to the window, I had been watching this younger kid hobble around outside for about 5 min. now, as he made it to my house i knew he was coming in.  I sighed as i heard the front door open, really I just wanted to be alone.  The kid called out to ask if anyone was here and I answered ""on the second floor"" at least he had some courtesy I thought.  I listened to him make his way to my room and as I stood in the door way i could instantly feel his wanting of something.  Had he just been trying to fix he would have done it as quick as possible and left.  Before he could even ask me anything I muttered a low grumbly ""what?"". he proceeded to tell me how his veins were horrible, the cold had made them worse and had just wasted 2 bags trying to hit his neck, he had to panhandle again still half sick so that he could get two more and he had been hobeling outside trying to find someone to hit him in the neck when he saw the house and thought of checking it for a person skilled in the trade of iv drugs.  While this is literally something I don't do EVER, the reason being a whole other story,  I literally thought to myself ""its Christmas I guess"" and made the decision to help the kid out.  As he fixed up his shot, a problem occured that I had not considered before that, I was obviously now craving one myself.  No way my own bags, exactly enough for one fat Christmas morning speedball, would survive the night in my pocket till morning.  As I pulled back the blood and registered in his neck the fuck-it's had already completely washed over me, i fixed the last of my shit immediately after and instantly my relaxing Christmas eve. was no more.  I ended up spending all night pan-handeling as I did not get to a good spot until 9pm and it was Christmas eve.  Once I had got 25 bucks together for another speedball it was almost midnight and by the time i made it back north it was 30 after.  The kid had tagged along with me and as we both walked around the badlands that night looking for dope and coke on Chritsmas eve, I somehow felt better.  My mood was lifted, it felt good just being out in the snow doing my favorite thing with someone else.  I definitely felt better than i did sitting all alone in that squat.  There where plenty of corners out that eve but alot of the good ones, as usual late at night, where inside.  In the end we copped a stamp called 7 up, ok shit but def. not the best at the time.  If your wondering did we get a Christmas discount? the answer is no but that night is forever frozen in time for me and every Christmas i think about it ...every Christmas I think maybe just one more .. BUT .. I have not found the need to do so .. YET.  even though I can feel it getting closer and closer I'm just gonna keep holding on.

I want to keep my Morales in one piece. Ill steal from a store, but never a person. 
Well, long story short, my grandmother is a bitch. She has been mean and hateful to me my entire life,always trying to make sure she pits my mom and I against one another.  and she has been more, and more manipulative and decieteful in her attempts the older I've gotten. I mean this bitch knows NO boundaries at all, none. And I have honestly never done anything to warrant the way she treats me. 
So I was living in a trailer my mom owned until my grandmother called the owner of the trailer park, and urged them to evict me, claiming my mom couldn't bring herself to evict her child. Well it worked, but backfired when my mom let me move into the house she shares with the bitch, until I got on my feet. (I wasn't paying any rent before I was evicted, so taking on a full rent payment, or house payment wasn't something I was planning on). 
So now my grandmother has resorted to straight up psychotic shit. Claiming I pushed her down, I did not touch the bitch. 
So this morning the bitch tried to say that I stole my mother's Christmas present from her. A fucking bottle of perfume. I don't even wear fucking perfume, it gives me horrible migraines. 
Yet my mother believes every single psycho lie that comes out of her mouth, no matter how ridiculous it is. 
I'm seriously to my breaking point. It must be exhausting to be as hateful as she is, and it must be really tiring to maintain so many different personalities in the same skull.
(Side note, I literally saved her worthless life, literally)
I don't know wtf to do. In pretty resigned to the fact that my kids are my only family left.

Hes been out of prison since august of 2016. i guess it was good that was out even that long, but in that time he ODed 4 times so being free it was only a matter of time. This time he ODed at home. He was doing it with a friend, She ODed. He yells down to ask her how the shit was but with no response. Then he goes ahead and does his shot anyways(always a dumbass). The other people in the house realize that the first person had ODed so they give her the only narcan they have. Then, they realize my brother is also.

He recently told me that he wants to split because he feels like he shouldn’t be apart of anyone’s life with cravings for heroin and other drugs. He feels like he is selfish and needs to get himself together before we continue a relationship/ starting a family. I completely agree with this but he doesn’t have a major issue with drugs and I am willing to “fight” the demons with him. I know it’s something I can’t control or help him with but I truly feel like he shouldn’t be alone and he’s asking for space. I trust him completely on wanting to grow alone but I’m worried he’ll find himself in the dark hole he’s been in and won’t be able to get out. His father passed away 3 years ago around this time of year and he gets really apathetic towards everything and everyone around the winter holidays. He always says he always wanted to be the father he had growing up because that’s the person who meant the most to him and I believe him completely. So I think having this baby will make him let go of the minor cravings he has for heroin. 

Am I an idiot for thinking this? 

He does cocaine socially and smokes weed often but heroin was never on the agenda. He tried it two years ago and enjoyed it but he never let himself go down a really ugly path with it. The times he has tried it have all been during the winter holidays when his dad passed(assuming he’s using it as a coping method). 

Should I keep the baby and be optimistic or should I abort the baby and give him the space that he wants?

I’m honestly not sure what to do... 

My fear isn’t being a single mother, my fear is having to potentially deal with a dead partner and blaming myself for depriving him of what potentially could have saved his life..

Please give advice. I am financially stable and so is he. We both have good jobs so just keep that in mind when commenting, thanks.",1514369483.0

Slightly curious..","So, me and my girl have been using Heroin for about 18 months (daily use). It got to the point, as it almost always does, of wanting to get off it. Having done this before and obviously failed, we decided to try a different route than last time, which was weaning off using Methadone (120mgs first day and 10mg less every day for two weeks).

This failed as the cravings got too bad and the heroin was just too accessible to us. However, this time around, we are actually going about it in a proper manner. We successfully scored some french Bupe from the streets and began a taper, we're down from 8mgs/day to 2mgs/day nine days later. 

During Xmas I took her with me to my family in Stockholm and found some Targin laying about. Having never seen this medication before, but seeing oxycodone listed as the main ingriedient, I was intrigued, however upon further inspection, I discovered the pills actually contain Naloxone also. The person in need of the pain medication has no need for it any more and told me to bring it back home with me if I would like to. So I did. 

Being a pharma-interested guy my whole life, I know a thing or two about the affinity of Bupe, how it interacts with the Naloxone in Suboxone, and how the Naloxone effect differs with regard to ROA.
Having been off Heroin for about ten days, only on bupe and the occasional Xanax and Tramadol to lessen the WDs at family functions during Xmas etc. I was wondering how the Naloxone would effect us.

 My personal guess would be that taking ten or fifteen Targin tablets orally, probably wouldn't induce PWD, but shooting them would. My other thought is that the bupe currently in our system (we insufflated the last of our remaining stash about ten minutes ago) would block the effects of the oxycodone regardless of the other stuff. But I was thinking, now whilst going through my phone and deleting all my dope-dealers telephone numbers, if I maybe should buy some more Bupe and taper a while longer to lessen the temptation for relapse after such a quick taper. But then I remembered the Targin.. Is it possible to wait for the Bupe WDs to come, and then dose the Targin for some relief? Or is there enough bupe still attached to our receptors for the Naloxone to send us into an even deeper WD until it wears off and the Oxycodone hits? 

Basically, my question is: What would happen, if:
1: Insufflated the targin when the Bupe WDs are present but mild
2: Take them orally now (on Bupe)
3: Insufflate them now (on Bupe)
4: Wait until after the other opiates are out of our system and then take them in any number of ways

Sorry if I am abit all over the place or am writing confusing. I haven't actually typed anything on a keyboard for a long time and I'm also on some Alprazolam, and it's 6:16am where I'm at and sleep is something WDs just doesn't let me have.

For the unaware, it's a show where they seemingly investigate all aspects of any kind of drug game you care to mention through a variety of hidden cameras as well as more traditional investigative television. However, I'm skeptical about some of the actors and the integrity of the producers.

They seem to get a lot of shit right, but there are some subtle tells. I have a sneaking suspicious that it might be something along the lines of 50/50 real/fake.

Regardless, I've seen a bunch of it, and some of the the shit that goes down can be kind of funny and ridiculous. The one on Staten Island had some funny shit with these cops trying to cold call dealers, and if they weren't cops, they were definitely clueless actors who helped add some spot on, ytypical ""cops who just don't get it"" kind of vibe.

They had this ""cop"" calling random dealers going ""Hey yo, it's Steve, you around or not? I need 8.""

8 what? And just little shit like his tone, and the way he said ""You around *or not*?"" For whatever reason that little bit at the end right there would clue me in to it being a cop. Call it ""junkie intuition"" or whatever, but I think nearly any custie is kind of hyper aware of the wording of their initial pitch, and sort of naturally avoids negative language like that. It's simply ""you around?"" or ""trying to see if you're around,"" or some variation of that. His tone didn't help at all and he kept being like ""yeah, remember me, with the pick up truck?"" It tends not to matter. Any dealer with half a brain won't serve to someone who hasn't been vouched for. But this dudes voice was literally the vocal equivalent of the ""cop knock."" IIRC, they nab the guy for some dumb shit, like a bundle or maybe like 7 bags. 

Another pretty funny bit was this dude going ""yeah, this is my 40 Glock! It's on!"" and his burner was this garbage little no name 40 that looked like an airsoft gun he bought from a corner store or some shit.

7mbt05,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mbt05/double_standard/,27,https://redd.it/7mbt05,asmodean0311,Double standard,"So my sister and her husband are down from Michigan for the holidays.  She's a raging alcoholic and everyone knows it.  If she doesn't have a drink every so many hours she gets the shakes, etc.

Well this time they didn't rent a car, so they have to borrow my mom's car if they want to go anywhere.  My mom doesn't allow alcohol in the house, so if my sister wants to drink she has to leave.  Using someone else's car (my mom's) and then come home drunk.

She's done this twice so far.  The first time my mom knew and was livid.  She flipped her lid, so to speak.  The second time my dad tried to hide it from my mom, partly because he's in denial about my sister's problem and partly because he thinks drinking is okay.

Well, today it just happened again.  She said she was going running, but even her husband knew what she was going to do.  He even told her she shouldn't go 'running' with air quotes.  My dad helped her find the keys...

This pissed me the fuck off because everytime I leave my house for more than 30 minutes I get back to back phone calls from my dad accusing me of going to buy drugs (they live next door).  Even if I'm broke or I have my daughter with me.  If I try to explain what I'm doing, after being asked where I am and what I'm doing, I get called a liar.

So I straight up told my dad I didn't appreciate the double standard.  Dad said, ""She said she was going running."". And I said, ""When I do that, I'm just called a liar.  That's a double standard."". Then I left cause evidently the conversation had ending, if his lack of speaking was any indication.

Yeah, I know there's a difference between alcohol and heroin.  But I never asked for their car to go get fucked up and she's never been called a liar to her face...",1514337426.0

Any advice?,"So yeah I’m pretty much at the end of another run. Broke, defeated, starting to get sick; but this time something’s different. Instead of wanting to scheme up a way to get cash or score money, I want to just get over the fucking sickness and get my life back together. 

I was taking kratom for a few years straight (anywhere from 5-6 grams, 3-4 times a days) and I ended up getting my friend’s brother’s connect. He sells just about everything so I just started picking up addies and he would always show me his dope and ask me if I wanted any. I avoided that for like 2-3 months and then I gave in and decided to try a 20 bag at the beginning of summer. I got super high and then went back to my usual kratom and occasional pills. This was at the beginning of summer like 7-8 months ago. 

I, of course, gradually picked it up more and more. At first I’d wait like 2 weeks between and then eventually... well I think you guys get the picture. And of course I’ve become someone that does things I never imagined myself doing. I haven’t gone nearly as far as it can go and I know it can always get worse. Thankfully haven’t resorted to crime or stealing from family or friends, but now I’m actually starting to have thoughts about that and I hate it.

So here I am, off my subs for a couple months (I was on them for 3 months until I cracked) and getting off a binge of 2 months or so.

I always snort my dope and it may not sound bad for only 2 months, but before that I was taking 16mg of subs a day, and before that Oxy, Vicodin, and kratom. This also isn’t my first dope binge, just the first since I’ve been on (and now off) the subs.

Basically, I’ve been taking some form of opiate for nearly 4 years or more. I’m super scared of the withdrawals.

I did my last little bit of dope way earlier and decided to go to my little cousin’s house to get away from my house as I start to get sick. I’m a 23 year old male and he’s a 16 year old teen playing games right now and probably wondering why I’m acting the way I am.

I have some kratom and just bought Imodium hoping it will help. When I get back home I have 900mg gabapentin which I heard is decently helpful when used properly.

Bad or good idea to go away to my cousin’s as I’m starting to get sick??

I want it this time. I really do. I’m sick of being a fuck-up and disappointing myself and my parents / sister who have done sooo much to put me ahead in life.

I’ve also never tried the Imodium before but I know to be safe with the huge dosing. I know it can help if used with some caution.

Any advice?",1514332994.0
7mbcdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mbcdf/harm_reduction_tips_and_tricks/,8,https://redd.it/7mbcdf,dopefiction312,Harm Reduction Tips and Tricks,"Hey opifriends. I post a lot of dope porn and brag a bit but wanted to start a talk focusing on the other side of what makes this sub so great: Harm Reduction. 

When I first started using and especially IV this place was a life saver due it's endless stories and tips from veterans who give real life answers and less rhetoric than your average harm reduction source. Any one want to share a tip they have learned a long the way that has helped reduce harm, pain and hospital visits? I'll start: 

When i was began IVing I always wanted to see how quickly I could complete the ritual. Taking pride that I could get a shot in under less than 2 minutes. I also found myself with lots of a abscesses and ify swollen hands or arms that could have been anything from a histamine reaction to MRSA and I never honestly knew. I blame a lot of this on my impatience to confirm I had a good clean register. I pretty much took any flash of blood as a sign that I was in and would plunge away telling myself some shots just hurt more than others. Lord was I wrong. 

Since then I've realized how much harm it did on my body and veins but how much dope I wasted and how many great buzzes I didn't get to experience. If you're not 100% sure that you have a register (dark blood shooting up through the middle of the barrel not just slowly creeping up the sides) than don't take the shot and try again. I know this can be frustrating and seemingly time consuming but it's always worth the extra 5 minutes to find a good vein than it is to sit in a hospital or not enjoy your shot because you're nervous you done goofed. 

Getting a false register has also inadvertently put me in a position where I nearly ODed because I had a false sense of how strong the dope was. I would shoot a point, miss most of it and think ok this stuff is mild I can def handle 2 points. Load it up, get a real register the next time and get blown back because it wasn't as weak as I thought it was. This can be a pretty scary experience because you feel like you're going in with good info and that confidence distracts you from being critical and using proper caution the next time around. 

Learn and know the signs of a proper register and what a register from an artery looks like and save yourself heaps of pain and discomfort and trade it in for an awesome rush and since of confidence that you did things the right way. This will make the high just that much better. 

Anywho! That's my one small tip you won't really find in the medical books that I learned along the way. Would anyone else like to contribute?",1514332488.0

I made a post detailing the situation but only kept it up for 24 hours because it's a very specific incident and I couldn't put my identity at risk. Basically in late October of this year I was arrested and held in police custody during this 8 hour excursion that simply shouldn't have happened. I generally take full responsibility of my actions and don't play victim, but this was horse ass. 10 cops, 2 K9 units and the FBI later I have serious felonies hanging over my head on a very prestigious federal site. 

I talked to 2 private attorneys in person, and both of them told me I'll likely get some prison time and that my case is such a shit show that they, as attorneys, want nothing to do with it, but will be hired if I really want them. Discouragement at it's finest.

If you haven't received a court date in 45 days you're supposed to call this number on the back of your tickets that show your charges. It's been around 60 days now, so I called today. 

The arresting officer never put my case in for filing. 

So does this mean I dodged a bullet, need to learn a lesson and continue on my merry way as a confused but trying degenerate? Or does it just mean I still have to go to prison? The arresting officer didn't know what the fuck he was doing and needed step by step instructions from several people around to go through the process of an arrest.

I have been using BTH since April of this year. I snorted all the way up until a couple weeks ago then made the switch to IV. I had a previous BTH addiction 8 years ago but had always used some sort of opiate here and there. I don't know why but that feeling I get when using makes me feel whole. This time is different though. I have a wife of 4 years and 2 children under 3. They are the light of my life. Everything has come to the surface about my addiction and I had not used since Thursday of last week. I used small amounts of Subs and some Kratom to help with RLS(which is the worst) and the W/D was not all that terrible compared to what I experienced 8 years ago. Today I woke up with a little RLS but not terrible. But the overall feeling of anxiety, fear, and depression every morning is overwhelming. I drank some Kratom but no subs and felt decent. On my way to work I was looking for a lighter and found a rig. I thought I had thrown them all out... apparently not.....Long story cut short finding that through me for a loop and I ended up relapsing today. I do not want to use any more. I have a great career a wonderful family but if I continue to live this life I will lose it all. I have put my wife through so much and it hurts to see the pain I have caused. My son is 3 yrs old and is starting to pick up on things and I do not want him to go through this. I guess my question is whats next. Will I go back through the rough withdraws all over again just from this one relapse? I am done with this shit. I know the feelings I am experiencing (anxiety, overwhelming fear, and depression) are fake and are caused by my drug use. Any suggestions or hopeful stories that can shift my focus and help me understand this is not permanent and it does get better. I will recover if I want to. Which I do more than anything.

My first ever opiate high. It was amazing, best thing I have ever felt. I wasn't expecting much off 10mg as I am 6'2 and 185lbs, but started with that dose in case I was one of those people who are sensitive to opiates, which I now think I am probably am. 

I am happy with that high and am not concerned with chasing a ""nod"". To be honest anything stronger than what I felt (complete full body euphoria and bliss) I would consider overkill. My question is if I wait 4 weeks between every 10mg, will I ever develop a tolerance or need to up the dose?

I ask because some drugs like MDMA, you never really get that first time high back again, even if you wait 5 years before taking it again. Though I believe this has something do with the chemical composition of MDMA and how it is processed in the brain, which I don't think opiates have (I could be wrong).

Yes, I know what you will say ""your once a month plan won't work and you will become a weekly, then eventual daily user and addict"" ... ""everyone thinks they're different but it will happen to you too"". But that aside, lets assume that the four week gap between doses is never broken.

Watch out for these symptoms.,"Here's an article about a case where someone went to the hospital for malaise, fatigue, fever and 'tea-colored' urine while kicking opiates. Turns out they were either taking tramadol or their kratom was contaminated, and they weren't metabolizing the tram. Led to a rather unpleasant case of hepatitis (chemically-induced, not viral)

These symptoms are pretty standard when withdrawing, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're using kratom to kick.

I usually do .3 shots of very high quality heroin and .1 of this fent put me down to where EMTs had to narc me three times so please be careful. 7 years of addiction and the only 3 times ive OD'd was the past cpl months. Back when i first started fent was unheard of, no its flooding the market. Be safe and always have a using partner who has narcan, or better yet dont even IV it. A high isnt worth dying over no matter how shitty your life is.
