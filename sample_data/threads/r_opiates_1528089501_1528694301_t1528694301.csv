For the past year or so, I’ve had a somewhat regular supply of 10mg Percs, which are my faves, and 10mg generic hydrocodone. I also have “diagnosed” add and have had an Adderall script for almost 8 years. My doctor hasn’t increased the dosage in like 6 years though, and as we all know, tolerance is a b, so in order for my Adderall to really work for me, I’m taking approximately 2x the prescribed amount, thus running out early, fml, etc, etc., 
I’m rambling though so I’ll get to the point regarding the opiates...
Depending upon my ability to obtain them, I may be on them a week or more, then off a week or less with the number of pills capping out (at most) at 7 a day, though on a good day I may only eat 5 or less and it’s also relative to my Adderall supply. My question is-
is extreme fatigue and lethargy on off days the norm? Reading online it isn’t really a major withdrawal symptom, so I don’t know if I cant attribute the tiredness to that, but they give me the most amazing motivation and energy and day one without I’m seriously zombie mode. 
I don’t think my usage is to the point to where serious withdrawal symptoms occur, (i have had minor muscle aches and RLS but definitely nothing unbearable) which is why the total lack of energy thing is kind of concerning me, because it’s my most noticeable symptom yet the one I see listed lease online.

Just wondering if it’s normal because as of now, the percs are more beneficial to my productivity and motivation than my actual add meds, which just makes me paranoid I have some undiagnosed terminal illness. Or something.
Sorry for rambling. ",1528694041.0

I know trileptal causes drowsiness but this is just so intense.

I have relapsed and am sniffing fentanyl laced heroin, fentanyl laced mannitol to be truthful. Maybe there is heroin in it once in a blue moon. Now it seems the trileptal potentiates the full agonist. If I sniff a dose after my trileptal dose I get so much higher. Euphoric, nods, warmth the whole nine yards. Interestingly enough I am able to stay awake better.

They let me live with them if I stayed clean and they were giving me a home drug test every 2-3 days at different times of the day. I've been staying clean because I knew I'd be caught if I relapsed, and I was trying to save my money to move out first. 

I asked them if they'd take me to a sub doctor because I was struggling and my mom thought that meant I relapsed because her internet research told her subs aren't for people who are clean and her cult AA family support group probably told her the same. My brother was barely a chipper and he quit with no problems. He told my parents months after they found out about me that he used to get high with me too but he's clean. They think because he did it cold turkey without wd or any help that it's easy and I can't do it because I'm not ""taking recovery seriously"". Long story short, my mom was convinced I wasn't clean anymore because I asked to use subs.

This morning I called in sick to work because I haven't been sleeping well and I couldn't think straight. I've been working 60-70 hours a week and I needed a break. I sat on the porch to have my coffee and I fell asleep. My mom woke me up and started yelling at me for nodding out on the porch and for scaring her because she thought I od'ed again. 

I walked to my second job in the evening to get away from the house and when I came home she went through all my things. She found a needle cap in my car and a empty bag in my old jacket that I don't wear anymore. Both of those are from before I got clean and it's reasonable that they got lost and I forgot about them. My dad tried to back me up but he takes my moms side in arguments in the end. They didn't even care if I offered to pass a drug test because of I'm ""cheating them"" somehow yeah? So they kicked me out and stopped talking to me again and I immediately relapsed because fuck it. 

I was planning to get my own place and relapse then when I could enjoy it in my own apartment and feel like I deserved it. Instead I'm staying with a friend and shooting up in a walmart bathroom because he'll kick me out if I bring anything to his place. Fuck man even if you try sometimes you just can't win.

**I have decided I am going to try get high today no matter what. I do very much appreciate any concerns about interfering with my maintenance but it's happening regardless.** Whether this takes me putting a mountain of powder up my nose or having my friend hit me; **it's happening**.

My last dose of 6mg suboxone was 12 hours ago (and it is 9am here, won't be picking up till later and could wait till the evening to make it 24+ hours). 

Thus I would appreciate any advice regarding dosage differentials (even if approximate). If 0.1-0.2 insufflated got me high before the 6mgs of sub; how much should I insufflate on the sub? Lets say I had my friend hit me to better break through, how much should I have him load up? 

If I manage to get high today (full agonist binding achieved), I should obviously be skipping my suboxone dose tonight, but if I didn't, would I go into precipitated WDs?

I've only ever snorted coke before, so if I snorted it this would be my first time snorting an opiate. And if I boofed it, this would be my first time boofing, period. 

I know the intranasal bioavailability of oxymorphone is 43% and the rectal bioavailability is 50.7%, so if I boof it I am getting slightly more bang for my buck. But which will be a better high?

I usually do oxy*codone* and when I do, I only take it orally. However, that's never given me the famous opiate ""rush"" I hear everyone talking about. From what I understand, you have to snort or IV to get the rush. Is that true? What about if you boof it?

Basically, I've been an occasional user of prescription opiates ever since I found an old bottle of vicodin in my parents' cabinet when I was a teen. I've been a regular pot smoker ever since around that time too, and I'm in my late twenties now, but despite trying all sorts of drugs I've never formed an addiction to anything besides my habitual (daily) smoking of the weed. Though I love the feeling I get from opiates, I knew that it was a dangerous game and I never escalated past the occasional painkiller that I'd come across (couple of surgeries, scripts from friends surgeries, etc) maybe a few times a year max. I'd never gone out of my way to purchase them on the street or anything, and no one in my social circle is a regular user (at least not that I'm aware of).

... Until this year. Be it a combination of boredom, depression about my employment/life situation, yearning for the feeling again, spending too much time browsing this sub, and figuring out that you can find oxy connects on craigslist, whatever reason you'd like to ascribe, I made my first street opiate transaction and got blues for the first time. Basically, I got a 10pack went on a little bender for a week before taking a month break. I definitely noticed that it was hard for me to keep away from them when I had them in my possession, but I knew enough to stay away from buying them again too soon, and honestly I didn't want to. I had no interest in becoming a physically-dependent opiate addict.

This was almost 6 months ago and honestly not much about my use has changed. I'm not buying ten packs, usually it's about 3 at a time, and maybe once every other week. I have kept it on a schedule where I have never once experienced physical withdrawal symptoms.  I do not feel that I rely on the pills, and I have turned my life around in terms of finding purpose, figuring out an employment situation that makes me happy, and I've never been more in love with my partner. Though, they do not know about my secret indulgence. That's honestly what gives me the most guilt--keeping this all hidden from them when I'm partaking. But usually, I take the drugs when they're not around because I love being high and giving myself some quality alone time. 

So, am I just a foolish idiot? I love opiates and I want to keep doing them because... well, I love them and the feeling they give me. I know that I don't want to go broke/into debt because of them, I know that I want to practice safe harm-reduction like using fentanyl test strips on new batches, and I definitely know that I don't want to get to the point where my body needs the oxy to feel okay. And I feel really confident in myself that I can keep this up. But like a lot of people, I read the posts on this sub about ""chipping being impossible"" and ""it's only a matter of time"" and a little part of me worries.

**TL;DR:** I've been chipping oxy for almost half a year now and I don't feel my life spiraling out of control. In fact, it's getting better. What's your take on what I'm doing?",1528652498.0

Fun story of trying to find all the dope connections in a one week bender below. 


So... FROM WHAT I REMEMBER.
What would you get, and why. 
60 each of these. I thought he said $100 for 60? But this was like a year ago, tho I'm sure he's still around if he's alive. I just need to know. :P I mean I've heard of $1 a mg but these are dillies.

I think it was 60 per, or 100 per and then  60 vials?For $100 each selection?? I forget.
> What would you get, and WHY~???
So, 
> 1mg hydromophone IR
> 2mg hydromorphone IR

> 1mg hydromophone XR
> 2mg hydromorphone XR

> and 2mg little injectable vials?? either 60 or $100 of those. 




###########################################################




I'm just curious at this point. I wonder if this guy is even still around.  Legs are a big concern. I heard dillies don't last very long??I remember snorting them with next to no tolerance and enjoying them for hours. IDK, heroin lasted VERY, VERY LONG when I was first doing it. Heck. When I was shooting I made one point into 3 needles~! Sometimes I shoot one in the evening and two the next day! Or vice-versa. 

I met this disabled guy. He was mocking someone, and I think he's making fun of some ""kid"" about morphine,..fuck, I just had to pop in( See the thing is....0_0 I was on a relapse, AND, like a man on the run, I knew I was going to end, I knew I was going to crash, but before I did,fueled by iv coke & heroin,  I wanted ""MORE"". More variety. I wanted to find ""THE BEST"". and thru socializing-actually spending time and getting to know various people, looking for dealers, and talking to all sorts of people, I mean... may be a dead end or may punch you people,..I had tried SO MANY different sources of dope,  ALL-FUCKING-WEEK-LONG) I got the number of a prostitute with green teeth, that I will never - ever talk to - she said if I ever ""you know need a release"" I can call- I got that just because she might actually have a hookup down the line. I went to areas I've never been, got high with people I've never met. 

I freaked out a dealer in a bathroom. Caught up with him. Told him I know what he was doing, but just chill ""I'm networking"" and showed him a big chunk of dope. He shows me a bag of little bags like so what. Then doesn't wait for me to go to the bank machine. 

I give a girl a pack of smokes I find on the bus to track him down. This is after asking 10 people at the library if they knew where he went. 

HE WAS SELLING IN THE CORNER OF A CORNER STORE~!! I WAS LIKE OK. TOOK MY SHIT. Gave chicky a point, ""What about the cashier""... ""Dude, of course they know"" 

3 people came up to him for hand to hand while I watched that. Days later when the relapse was over that side of the corner store had a massive flag hanging, hiding this guys ""corner spot"" heh. It was really a corner spot. A corner, in the corner store, on the corner :P 

Where I met the wheelchair dude was right outside of there. 

So this kid was actually bragging, saying he gets hydromorphone cause his Dad is in the H.A., which in Canada is such a lame thing to say, but it happens all the time. So wheelchair guy said we all know he's full of shit. And he clearly didn't even understand what the drug is. ""Trust me, I do, I mean, look at me"" and he sorta waves his wrist and gibbled hand"" He's in a wheelchair, his neck looks like it's in a weird sort of crook, his hand barely extends. 

Anyway, I ask him about his pain management. Quickly learn he only uses pot medicine cause it actually deals with the inflammation. He gets lots of hydromorphone but sells it all. 

Says sometimes WD decides who has first pick. I'd imagine he gets sob stories every month, even from those stocking up SHEESH.



I'd laugh if everything was $60 for 100 pills. I've gotten dillies for some weed a few times and sorted and plugged it. And bottles of morphine for free. ALL BEFORE I EVER SHOT ANYTHING.  I also took some percs. meaningless amount. I really wish I had more experience with pills. 

At the time I remember thinking, FUCK, that sure sounds cheap~!!! But I was at the end of a relapse and I had been caught and was off to treatment again. I'd love to get 10 of those once a month. Hell, even a few every weekend. 

I know he's not a phony. And I've kept his number all this time. 
I thought at the time, so this is when I see this guy, not at the start of this crazy dope bender, sheeesh~!!",1528651839.0

I tell the dude I want a gram and he replies 'aight man, that'll be $60' and I thought I misheard him so I was like nah dude I need a full gram and he starts rolling his eyes. I hand him the $60, assuming he'll just run off with the money but I wouldn't have really cared. He's got a habit after all, I'm not judging. Anyway, he returns like a minute later and actually gives me a gram. I'm shocked so I throw him $40 for getting it and have a laugh about it.

Second thought is school and such. Next step is spin cycle.,"I have a complex situation. It will be easier to boil it down so I'm not pushing all that reading on anyone. I was slipping(didn't use) in transitional housing. The executive director overruled kicking me out. And from that time I went above and beyond. tbh even the original stuff was mostly lead by a guy who was a bully who literally bullied my female case worker right before she quit. 

Anyway, I was told-after the executive director left. That getting some plastic in the organics(I volunteered for the grossest job, one of many things I did to show appreciation. And ""taking a tone, while being polite and not using bad language, I'll admit that"".

Was now grounds for me to be ""moved on"".
They wanted to send me downtown. Right where I used to call the best dealer I've ever known. I went into, I have tons of money saved up from EI, I""m going to fucking use so much dope. I'm so depressed, they're taring me out of my community. 

I DIDN'T EAT OR SLEEP MUCH FOR 2 DAYS. 
But I got thru it. I'm going to move 5 - 10 minutes away. Rent a room and share everything else. Stay in school, doing my upgrading in the same complex where I used to live. Stay in this area. Stay using WorkBC-for school funding for college-help. 

Use the non-profit temp agency. 

However. Being free from people watching over me has the fantasies coming back a lot. I keep thinking. So if I don't take my methadone for half a day, and then do dope. Then wait for withdrawal the next day, take methadone like normal. 

I keep running thru how I can use while still keeping my methadone carries and making it all work. I know this isn't what I'm supposed to do. But I feel like I'm being pushed from the community I know, a place where I didn't use cause I had to not use dope to stay. But I refuse to leave this area and go downtown to another 2nd stage. Especially a place that's no joke where I would phone my guy and then walk a number of blocks to meet him.

If things work out one of these things will happen.
-I will use off and on, maintain my methadone carries situation and it will be all good. 
-I will use off and on and it will all go to shit.
-I will concentrate on meditation and how I'm into fitness and being healthy and I'll weigh even more than 170lbs any day now.

You need to understand weighing 170lbs is crazy for me, even before dope. I really do want to concentrate on health and fitness, and most of all school. But I've been single for a couple of years after getting clean and I've only been on a few dates. 

I'm just not satisfied with life over all. Dope keeps seeming like that old hobby that used to bring me so much piece. I keep telling myself I'll just use a bit here and there and still focus on school, getting the girl and all that. 

IDK if this makes sense.

Got this cute girl from work into me and i can't make a fkn move because i can't bring anyone into my life.  I spend like 2 hours a day making tea because my habit is so big, I can barely stay well now, takes a ridic dose to nod and i don't even fkn want it anymore. 

 I woke up 2 hours ago and i'm only half way through making my morning dose and i just started typing this instead.  I have a bunch of morphine and oxy there, i'll get to it eventually but fuck it i can't take this much longer.  My whole life revolves around staying well/high when i can afford it.  I work non stop yet i have no money, i can't stop working to deal with my pain because i need paper to pay bills and my habit, i can't stop my habit because i hate my job.  What a fucking cycle it's ridiculous.

I wanna do it again, i wanna re\-find the joy in my life and be free of drugs but fucked if i can start.  

Even now the little addict voice just tells me it's Winter now we'll start in Spring.  In Spring it'll tell me we'll start in Summer.  All i wanna do is take my last 400mg of morphine and 500mg of oxy and go to sleep, thing is i'm not even 100&#37; that dose will kill me.

This cycle, it's nothing but misery and even mid nod there's no satisfaction because i know i'll wake up and need to do it again.  If you're just starting, fucking stop.

I know it effects the opiate receptors and all that, but for example.. it takes me about 200mg of oxy taken at once for me to have a good time. I take opiates strictly once every 7 days (I'm not dependent on opiates,  just have a high tolerance),  using Kratom everyday in between., 8Gs at 2x a day. I do NOT get withdraws in days I don't use either kratom OR oxy.

So 14 days ago I took 200mg. Then, 7 days ago, I take a 150mg dose assuming my tolerance dropped. I thought it was pretty weird that I didn't feel it as strongly as I expected. Yesterday, I take my full dose of 200mg. It's like I never even took 1 day off, as I barely felt the effects. 

Kratom must be responsible for this, right?? Has anyone else experienced this? Is it not strange that kratom is keeping my opiate tolerance at such a high level ?? There's no other explanation for this .... I am pretty shocked. I feel like my opiate receptors are not healing at all.

If you smoke a cigarette after having just put some heroin in your body, the cigarette intensifies the dope high by a lot. Because of my tolerance I literally never get that amazing feeling of slowly nodding out, unless I smoke a cigarette. Then, even if I microdosed, I find myself slowly drifting off.

After waiting in the ER for hours they finally call me back to do a xray, CT and something else. Then I wait some more.

Well around 6 this morning it's about time to get my abscess drained.

I decide to do a shot and sit back on the hospital bed and I fall out.

Shout out to the nurses who did the whole procedure while I was out so I didn't have to feel that pain (anyone who has has an abscess drained know that shit sucks)

Note I was still breathing, just very shallow, slow and my vital signs were low I guess.

Now that they're all done, what do you think they do next?

That's right! Narcan!

This was my first time ever getting narcand.

I jumped out of the hospital bed, confused

""What the fuck is going on?""
""How did I get here""

It was such a weird shitty feeling.
I felt like I could smell my brain burning or something.

I mean I knew getting narcan would suck, but that was ridiculous.'

Anyway the day I chose to get high I turned into a snowball because I was going down hill fast. Definitely one of my largest binges I’ve ever had. It was mostly the one thing we aren’t suppose to bring up and then dope of course. 

So I got about a week off work to detox like I’ve done multiple times the past couple years. I was worried about going cold turkey this time. I’ve never really been worried whenever I plan to get clean but this time I was having anxiety attacks while I was still using and my depression flared up like a mother fucker. 

So I start the detox. First two days I’m so anxious I barely ate or left my room. My legs are really relentless and I’m having a hard time lying still. I was off a lot of klonopin and dispensary grade bud for these two days so maybe that’s how I got a full nights sleep. Which is weird because when I detoxed off a longer habit, not larger, but more consecutive days than this run, 2mg kpin would knock me out for 4 hours if I was lucky and then I’d be wide awake for the next 20 years. 

Starting day three I started taking two large doses of Kratom. Once when I wake up and another 10-12 hours later. The only WD symptom I’m feeling before the Kratom is restless legs and anxiety. 


From day three to day five I feel pretty much the same. No hot/cold flashes, my bones don’t ache, I’ve been eating like a Samoan which has been great because now my pants actually fit and I don’t constantly like I’m sagging my pants like the cool kids did in middle school. 

Now it’s day 6 and I feel like I’m at baseline besides slight rls and anxiety but I’ve been an anxious fucker my whole life so that’s nothing new. I could probably skip the Kratom from here on out and just deal with the minimal discomfort and I’m going the rest of the weekend benzo free. 

I just don’t understand how this happened and why this detox. JJ couldn’t have blessed me with almost pain free detox that time I was out of state for a week surrounded by family in the humid south, or when I lived with my super protective mother. Who made me go to the doctor because I was so dope sick I couldn’t pass it off as a cold or some shit and then I had to lie to her and my doctor who I’ve been going to for a majority of my life and I think very highly of. 

This has to be the fourth or 5th time I’ve intentionally kicked a habit of these two opiates so I know what it’s suppose to feel like. I can’t remember how long the binge was, no longer than two months, so maybe that’s why it was this easy? Now my last question is, would using put me into some sort of WD worse than what I went through this week? Of course the goal is to not touch the stuff ever again but if I stayed true to that the first time I said that I wouldn’t be typing this post. Sorry for the novel I just haven’t posted on this sub much and even when sober I love this sub

For lurkers and new users you guys need to know that about these opioids and this addiction is that it doesn't fucking go away. Your love for pills and dope will overpower everything else in life and it will fuck you over no matter who you are or where you are from.

Before discovering this sub I thought I was different in the sense that I loved opiates more than anyone else that was the case with everybody I know in real life but my thoughts changed when I started coming on here. I've been on subs the last 8 months with just a few 1-2week benders in between. I've been living a new city and those benders only happen when I visit my hometown. I have no connections here besides for weed and don't do dope anymore and in my opinion I think pills are way harder to cold cop. 

Now I have been away from home for 2 years with going home occasionally and was home all of last summer where I developed a bad crack addiction but that's a story for another day. I have no friends or connections in the new cities I've been living in the last 2 years I can find weed and occasionally stims or benzos but no fucking steady pill connect and to top all of this I haven't been laid since last summer so I'm coming up on a year where I've barely talked to any girls. I have terrible anxiety when it comes to that shit and when I try and go places(20cant drink yet) I can't bring myself to approach anybody and just end up leaving. It's been frustrating and have no idea why I'm like this. I tell myself everyday I'm going to go out and either try and talk to girls or try and cold cop pills and that's the only thing that keeps me sober is that I'm going to do it ""tomorrow"".

Today I was alone my fam actually went back to my hometown and I was pissed I couldn't go with to go scoop 30 blues so I was like fuck it I'm gonna try and score here so after work I went to some methadone clinics and there I saw junkies coming in and out and I couldn't bring myself to approach anybody! Its like how I can't approach girls it's the same fucking thing I left and tried going back but whenever the moment comes I can't fucking do it. Why do I have this horrible approach anxiety of talking to new people. I know the obvious answer is to just go out and fucking do it get over it but I can't. I just have thoughts of getting rejected or called a cop or just being embarrassed and I just go home and smoke bud all day snorting subs eating good food I don't talk to anybody. 

In high school I had a lot of friends and didn't have this bad of social anxiety but ever since I've moved with my fam and I'm not going to school anymore I feel like such a fucking loser everyday I come on here looking at pics of pandas/blues/dope and wish it was me. I guess the tables just turned on me since the end of high school it's such an embarrassing thing to think already that time is the peak of my life so far i used to deal bud go to party's snort blow and hang with girls all the time now I fucking hate myself sit inside all day I'm scared to talk to ppl no matter what I tell myself and really just hate my fucking myself and my life is a joke. 

If you are just starting I would advise to quit I've been hooked over 3 years and had problems with stims and benzos before that just don't be surprised if similar things happen to you as well I see common feelings shared by all of us. Another big thing I can't seem to shake is feelings of envy.  It's burning a whole in me because I can feel the intense jealousy to people who don't have a fucking gorilla on their back telling me to get high all day everyday I dream about this shit is fucking tearing me apart both of my parents and both of our extended families have a history of addiction my parents have the same doc as me and are on subs too. I'm just wired this way although I had plenty of chances to stop I don't I'm definitely  not blaming it on genetics just saying this shit was bound to happen to me. Just wanted to share my experience things aren't going to well rn but I'm going home soon and gonna get rocked I can't wait im not quitting anytime soon cheers to ruining with your life with potent painkillers🍻",1528560881.0

May I begin by saying I in no way promoting what I'm doing, but saying that my question stems from is it possible to not have physiological dependence on DHC/Codeine after daily use.

I mainly ask as i've been going daily use for nearly 3 months now and 3 weeks ago I cold turkey'd for 1 week, mainly cause I wanted to see if I really was addicted after over 2 months. My daily dose has been 150 mg and since those 3 weeks I've been tapering that down. However, what I noticed was when I went off I didn't experience any of the typical withdrawal symptoms, maybe just being a bit cranky and mainly psychological effects e.g. cravings, does DHC differ in that it's just less likely to cause physical dependency or cause of its half life? Or was it just me not taking massive doses which helped?",1528552416.0

Each time I’ve done oxy (like 4 times) I’ve never  ever been sick. They’re not IR they're the OC's I just crush and rail or bomb. The day after I wake up just fine and dandy.

However whenever I do codeine or codeine derivatives, whether it be pills or syrup, I get really really sick. Especially the day after. 

Why is this? Is it because more pills = more shitty filler = bad for your stomach? Or simply because you need to eat a lot of codeine/weaker opiates (300-400mg) to catch a buzz and that ruins your liver and stomach?

I also know of people who experience the opposite, they get really sick on oxycodone but they don’t on other opiates.",1528553396.0

The addiction has been bad for 1 or 2 years now, and I am being given prescription tablets that are not mine. The over-the-counter version (lesser dose) has been banned about 6 months ago, so technically I should not be in possession of codeine at all. SO, this leads to my problem.

I really need to kick this addiction. I know it's not heroin but it's badly affecting my life, and I constantly crave it. The issue is that opiate based painkillers are the ONLY thing that even puts a dent in my period pain. I get extremely severe monthly pain, and without pain relief I would literally be contemplating suicide. It is that bad. It's intolerable.

I am scared to go to the doctor and ask for them to see if there's anything they can do. They will NOT prescribe opiates. I'm 99% sure I have endometriosis, which is causing this pain, but how do I explain how I've been dealing with it?

I liked the legality and thus availability and lack of consequences kratom had. But then my tolerance got so high and I got tired of taking it every day so my friend offered me suboxone to keep me well when I couldn't get any kratom, and ever since then I started taking suboxone. But honestly... I love suboxone. It feels really good to me and I've been using it for 6 years, so I have like a 6 year opiate tolerance under my belt so, I can hang lol. I was taking near 8mg twice a day of subs which I'm now prescribed thankfully. I was getting them off the street but then I almost got caught when they found 2mg strip as I was going to jail for marijuana. I said it was my script, and they never brought it up again. So I got a script after that.
Besides all of this I've always had a very methodical way of dosing and keeping myself at a fairly reasonable tolerance level. I dose twice a day, 3 times max, and it's usually always the same dose. It's worked for me for years.
I also basically just let myself become a drug addict because I had nothing else going on for me after high school. I was all alone I just said fuck it because I was so depressed and in a lot of pain and kratom helped a lot. And I'm still basically totally alone still 6 years later, no gf no friends so that makes it impossible to stop using. I went to a crisis place once to detox and they let me back home in like 5 days and I wanted to get right back to using, but I ended up sticking it out 6 weeks and then relapsing on christmas day. 
I guess this all sounds pretty bad but my parents know and I still live with my dad (at fucking 24) and didn't really work for most of my addiction just hustled, you guys know how it is pawning shit, stealing change, stealing games etc. But I finally got a job a year and a half ago so I'm doing better for myself now and not acting like a ""junkie"". My family I guess still thinks I'm clean, but they probably know it's a lie? I dunno man. I can't make anything of myself staying so high all the time but it's the only way I can handle life, I guess? It's a miracle I didn't try heroin and get addicted to that in my bad phase, I was really depressed and wanted to do it for a while. But I figured I was taking enough of a risk as it is using with my sleep apnea, didn't wanna OD.
The other thing is, I have strong willpower, I can kinda quit whenever I want. I just don't wanna deal with withdrawals right now and I don't have time for it. I've quit plenty of times over the years as I've run out of money or gotten caught or whatever.
So basically what I'm asking, is does this sound typical to you?Or am I different? What do you guys think about this shit? My life I guess? Am I a typical junkie loser just rationalizing my bullshit?

Basically I'm curious how different opiates and opioids feel qualitatively from each other, like how beer and wine can feel slightly different.  For example how does a morphine dose feel compared to an equivalent dose of heroin or hydromorphone? I have no reference point other than kratom, so it might be hard for me to understand but i'm really curious. Is there much difference at all?

The reason I ask is because I have very bad ptsd and when things got bad, well I started not being able to use drugs anymore due to terrible disassociation. Disassociation is linked to NMDA receptors, I cant smoke weed anymore and I can’t drink anymore as they both activate NMDA receptors.

I have a question I have really been struggling with the last couple days and I don't have anyone that I can talk to about this stuff, so here we go.

Am I really sober?

I graduated from college and made a super hard and heart breaking decision to relocate from the Midwest to the west coast. I cried like a little bitch when I had to pack up my diploma and belongings and leave my amazing friend group. I moved to the West Coast because I love the weather, the culture, the women...  I also have a decent job out here. Another HUGE REASON I left the midwest for the west coast is because I wanted to be in an environment where I didn't have access to opiates on a bi-weekly basis. Where I live now, I don't know anyone who does drugs, and that is a good thing. (I still go through intense moments of cravings if that matters)

Anyways, here is the problem. I have been sober for four months and my life is okay right now. Its really boring, but I am working and I am approaching five months of being sober. HOWEVER, I know that deep down, if junkie Jesus presented himself tomorrow.... I wouldn't be able to help myself. If a bottle of pink 10s fell from the sky, I would not have the power to say no. I would be crushing up lines on the sidewalk.

So am I really sober? I out myself in a position where I am living in a nice place, working, and I am technically clean on PURPOSE... But if I was given the opportunity to dance with the Devil again, I would do the tango. ",1528516380.0

And I loved these, in part bcuz I would get them for $10 a pop, bcuz I knew someone who got these rx'd, there first time he told me about them he described them as like morphine, as well as the first time he got fentanyl patches, I agree, that any strong opiate especially heroin, is technically like morphine, especially heroin, or diacetylmorphine.. but I immediately got on the internet and looked up ""Avinza""& to my delight found out they were indeed morphine sulfate extended release capsules:).  I purchased 2/$20 and opened the 1st one up to discover beads inside, @ 1st I was not very efficient at crushing then into a fine powder, but with time became very proficient at it..I'd dump the beads into a shot-glass and had a guitar string winder that's handle was perfectly suited to crushing them up!!  I then would take a $ bill and snort that amazingly bitter powder, and wait for bliss, and even though it would take a few mins to ""come up"" it never failed me! At first, I could do about 75/80% of a 120mg and be high as hell, but unfortunately as w/any opiate, tolerance occurred, and I would do one whole pill per dose, then one and a half, then 2.... I definitely was spoiled with a amazing hook-up.... And payed the price in the long run, physical addiction.  But I then started taking oxy (the OG, ""OC's"", God I'd do unmentionable things to get my hands on a few 80mg OC's again!!). And supplement, that with a nice stay off fent. Patchs I had collected for quite some time.... And then I found opana, then heroin.. at first insufflated, then I.v.  now I love iv heroin probably more than any other opiates, but if I could get those Avinza Cap's again for $10/a piece, I would take them over street H.

2) Travis Scott - Drugs you should try it. Seriously, if you like rap + opiates & havent heard this song while nodding with a cigarette in hand, do yourself a favor. The song literally enhances the high for me, if I could describe oxy in a song itd be this. 


3) Lil Peep - Star Shopping. Another great song to listen to outside smoking a stoge, with your vision fading in & out looking at the stars. Fucking beautiful.

I recently went through withdrawl and kicked the whole habit for 12 days straight. I was very proud of myself and I was close to getting the vivitrol shot. 

However, unfortunately, I was acting like an idiot and ended up buying up. I used $40 one day and then a $20 the next and yesterday I did $60.. unfortunately, I shouldn't have done that much but my addiciton took over. 

So how bad do you think the WD will be? Am I going to go into full blown withdrawl all over again? I don't want to use subs if I don't have to bc then I will just have to wait longer to be able to start doing the shot.

They cold turkey'd me off my 2-3g a day heroin habit on top of 120-200mg of methadone, and tapered me off of 60mg of diazepam in 4 weeks. This always sounded impossible to me but now it's done and I'm physically fine. I had to get sent to hospital my first week for lock jaw that was so intense I was fainting and excessive vomiting a few days later. They don't believe in any comfort meds and you're still expected to do duties when you can stand, it's fucking gnarly. After 2 months I'm used to it now, and then pain is gone, but fuck I just don't know about staying sober. 

The thought of never doing heroin again makes me straight up miserable, like I want to recover, I wanna stop ruining my relationships and job opportunities, I want to stop stealing, lying and cheating. I wanna stop living to nod out waking up with burn marks on my clothes and dead cig butts between my fingers, only caring about vinegary white powder. I would actually have to use methadone as well as heroin because heroin in any dose didn't seem to get rid of withdrawal properly. I also had to smoke crack as well to actually feel good not just well. 

But now my minds at, 3 months drug free, not even weed, what will heroin feel like. That first shot, will it feel like the first time? I rationalize that I'm gonna stay sober for a year sort my shit out and then get back to it.. but in my heart I know that it won't be long before I go back. I'm getting drug tested on a random day once a week so I'm already plotting to use straight after my first test. I don't know what's wrong with me.. 

It's like I got my family, my own well being and everything else in one hand and heroin in the other and the heroin hand is winning..

After a 45 minute drive we meet up, he hands me a wad of paper towel, I drop it in my lap and I'm on the way back home again, another 45 minute drive.


Before I hit the major expressway, I realize I need gas. Pull off, hop out and go pay and pump. Hop back in and homeward bound.


I reach my city and stop off at Walgreens to pick up some works. Hop out of the truck and it hits me like a bucket of freezing cold water... those were on my lap earlier when I got out for gas...


Look at my girlfriend and beg her to tell me she grabbed them, plead with her.  Nope. She doesn't have them.


I want to break down in tears. I just drove 45 minutes home, I know they're long long gone. But I have to go check, right? Obviously I have to go check.



Thus begins the longest drive of my life. My mind is racing, thinking of all the coulds and maybes. I keep telling myself, ""why would anyone pick up a wad of paper towel?"", hanging on that thread of hope that just maybe.. maybe..


Finally get off the expressway and I can see the gas station, still fighting with myself. ""they have to be there/there's no possible way those are still there"". I pull in and up to the pump I was at...

*And there they fucking are*, staring at me, wrapped in the most beautiful paper towel I've ever seen. They hadn't moved an inch, incredibly.

Anyway recently I found out that Codeine is sold over the counter with 500mg APAP and 30mg caffeine. I've never heard anyone abusing opiates here, hell no one even knows what they are. Gabapentin is also available OTC, it doesn't get me high at all aside from causing minor CEV's.

So I want to do a Cold Water Extraction to 18 pills, each containing 8mg codeine. If done correctly should I get a minimum of 120mg codeine? Would that be a good dose on its own for a 118 lbs male with zero tolerance?

And most importantly, would Gabapentin possibly potentiate the codeine high? Or would it lower the bioavailability like it would with hydrocodone?

And lastly, assuming I were to consume 120mg codeine, 900mg gabapentin, 540mg caffeine, some APAP leftovers, and 100mg diphenhydramine (for potentiation and possible nausea/itching): **is that too much for my liver to handle at once?**",1528463905.0

It holds me great, not worrying about getting money, dope or withdrawing is actually amazing.

Im seeing my doctors, psychiatrist, addiction specialist and psychologist every single week. Im engaging in treatment and beginning to learn to deal with cravings.

But the urge to get high is so fucking strong. First few days the 6mg of sub gave me a long arse buzz. But after that I found myself level yet still wanting to get high. I binged on xanax for 3 days (I know wht im doing with these dont worry), then cannabis and dabs for a few days (I dont normally smoke any weed so I was getting right cooked). Then binged on lyrica (god its awesome) for two days and today when I went to pick up more, dude pulls out his meth pipe, has a hit, gestures to hand it to me and I just say fuck it why not (first time doing methamphetamine). Hand it back and by thr time ive snorted the 150mg of lyrica I had cut up I was feeling fucking INCREDIBLE.

I found a few legit dealers that were very low key and used weird code words. Dude was legit but the add was kind of old and only had H now, no oxy.I don’t fuck with H. 

Met some dude in my area who fucked with shrooms, weed and coke. Could maybe get some benzodiazepines but never got back to me. Benzodiazepines interest me, but I have a med card, my girl has an ounce of shrooms and I personally  fucking hate any sort of stims, so it was a no.
Those were the Legit dudes.

The rest of them were the dudes in question living in really sketchy areas. Claim to have every drug under the sun In limitless quantity. Straight up advertising on Craig’s list, no code words or slang. Charging you up the ass, to either get robbed or get ripped off, I assume. 

One of those dudes had lower than average prices but only accepted PayPal or bitcoin but PROMISED he respected the costumer and wold come 14 miles at 1am to deliver as soon as he got the payment. Lmao. What makes me sad is I bet that had worked for him a lot in the past. It’s actually kind of genius. 

Claim your selling drugs. But only accept bit coin or PayPal. Never show up. Easy money. And there’s not much fools can do about. What are you going to do go the cops claiming you got scammed trying to buy illegal drugs? And even if you do, they would get charged with the lesser crime of fraud (does scamming fools trying to buy illegal drugs even count as fraud?) rather than, soliciting a controlled substance.

This program helps you find a job and housing if you agree to attend meetings, drug counciling, and most importantly get the vivitrol shot before release. You must comply with drug testing and get your shot every month for a year..the shot is completely free.

Maybe my tolerance went down so 10g lasted me before 2 weeks. Maybe they will last now longer? IDK all I know is that I will relapse. I am planing it in my head all the time. And it will be perfect. I will definitly be out of here next week. So I will relapse next week. Be back in the game and eventually die in the next few months if I keep consuming like that. So fuck it. I cant change myself.

Pick that up no issues, go get some cigs and soda, all smooth sailing. Well she has been playing the shit out of Pokémon Go lately so on our way home we always stop at the nearest gym (a church) and sit for a sec so she can play. 

While she’s doing that I’m crushing some H up. I give her hers to snort, then as I’m getting mine ready I see a cop going up the street in front of us. As he passes by us he slows down...like a lot. As soon as I lose sight of him I just go out on the road, turn left and start going home (this church is 3 minutes away from our apartment complex). I’m on the main road, about to turn right into the street we live on and I see the cop turn onto the road behind us. Shit. 

I put the H in its little container and set it in my door hoping that when the cop sees us pull into the apartments he’ll just go on his way. Instead he decides to stop by the entrance. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. As I’m pulling in I grab the container to hand to my SO and I realize the lid isn’t fully put on so as I’m handing it to her I say the lids not on. She didn’t quite understand what I meant and just put it in the backseat, meaning we have an open container with H presumably spilling all over my backseat with a cop about to stop us. 

I park by our apartment and I don’t see the cop so I grab the keys and start heading inside, not in a hurry as to not look suspicious, when he pulls in, spotlights me, and asks if he can talk to us for a sec. We walk away from our car so we can try to keep his attention off of it. He mentions he saw us pulled over at the church and that there have been “a lot of break-in’s in the area recently” (which there absolutely have not been), but we explain that we live here and she was just playing a game. 

He points out that our tags are expired and gets our licenses to run our names. The second my ID went from my hand to his I remembered I have an unpaid speeding ticket for going 79 in a 65. After a few minutes I see him grab his radio and I know somethings not right. He comes out and informs me I have a warrant, and if the fine I have on the warrant is more than $250 I’m going to jail and I honestly couldn’t remember how much it was for. 

Another officer comes, runs the info and says that because it was only $150 all they need to do is rewrite my bond, raise the fine, and give me a new court date, but I have to go to the station for paperwork. This meant that my SO had to follow me, in the back of a cop car, to the POLICE STATION with a gram of heroin rolling around in the back seat and we don’t know where it is. 

Luckily both officers were cool, filled out the paperwork and immediately went to a nearby parking lot to find my gram. As if everything going well with the cops wasn’t good enough the G was wrapped up in its baggie, wrapped in a sweater and not even a tiny bit spilled. Sorry for the novel but I’m still pretty shaken up, even though nothing happened I was terrified the whole time.

I brokered a deal to sell my only two laptops from this very hotel room/office. And I just smoked my free weed, which was legit... Very legit.

My new dealer looks like a white man in black face and he talked white (first time cold copping basically, got his number on that street waiting for a friend who was copping a few days ago), but I finally have someone to get bags for $5 off of, even just see him for $20. That whole area is watched though, I could see the cops just walking up to us after we meet and greet. It's the area around a city park that's maybe 3 square blocks. And im pretty sure the girl that started bringing me down to that area (she actually took me to the projects up the hill from the commons park and the biggest hospital in that side of town) just got busted down there, she would just cop hard and dip behind a dumpster. I never lived like this and I've been doing opiates daily for almost 15 years, it's crazy how bad I'm pushing my luck. The cops chased me around forever when I was leaving the projects about a week ago. 

I meet this guy on foot by these banks, I parked on a side and then walked up to the main Street corner. He walked up to my car after calling me and opened it as I walked towards him and put the dope in the seat, then he walked towards me, I gave him the cash as we passed. I could just leave the money in my unlocked car, watch him come and go and not even have to approach him.

PS Our situation and condition as human beings -- self aware beings who do relatively amazing things (compared to all other known life), yet we know ourselves to be just a blip in Earth's family tree, and we know earth to be a blip in the solar system, and that in the galaxy, and the galaxy in the Known Universe. The Known Universe, as I recently came to understand it, is not of a knowable size. If light speed really is the limit on how far how fast humans can go, that means that even if we were gifted light speed space ships with ultra powerful telescopes by Jesus or aliens, we would never be able to see much of what's out there or get to it. In fact, with telescopes that could see forever, we could see anything that wasn't moving away from us faster than the speed of light, but apparently quite a bit of the universe is moving away from us at a pace quicker than the speed of light. Yet, within these enormous expanses of time and space, we sit here, as simple mammals, saying I love, masturbating, generating milk, shooting powder from the park straight in our veins (which I thought was nuts when I was starting out snorting), and being sold shit in commercials and standing in our mammalian bureaucratic queues, getting licensed, dealing with painful social machinations that were designed by and for extroverts... So, let's all be really nice to each other.

8pgwqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8pgwqg/my_opinion_of_narcotics_anonymous/,12,https://redd.it/8pgwqg,chrislantern,My opinion of Narcotics Anonymous,"I feel so strongly about AA/NA.  These are not good feelings, I believe NA philosophy is neither medical, nor is it psychiatric in its nature.  It based on ideas that are over a century old that have been proven incorrect.  

It has been medically established that placing certain addicts, such as those who use opiates onto medication such as Suboxone and Methadone will save lives, prevent disease, reduce or eliminate illicit drug use and will be the most helpful thing to prevent relapse. My biggest problem with NA is that I was introduced to it in rehab.  My first stint at a drug rehab was when I was young, about 18 or 19.  This is where I was introduced to the concept of NA and rehabs charging 90k a month to teach you the Big Book.  The big book is AA’s main piece of literature that was written in 1933, and is ultimately what NA is based of.

NA preaches the idea that you are not clean and sober unless you abstain from all mind altering substances, that is including proven prescription drugs that work for opioid use disorder; Bupenorphine and Methadone.  What NA fails to realize is that opiates are a very difficult drug to just give up.  You can be physically dependent on opiates without being psychologically addicted to them.  I knew there was a long period in my usage where I did not want to get high, but had to use to prevent the agonizing withdrawal.

These people are not doctors and will recommend you giving up Medication Assisted Treatment, which is evidence based and proven to work, in favor for abstinence based recovery relying on a higher power? Whatever the fuck that might be to you. Basically pray you stay sober... that’s some real help.

On top of all of this, sometimes when you start to do good, you want to separate from all of this drug shit all together.  The last thing someone who is sober for a while needs is to be placed in a room full of drug addicts talking about getting high.  Someone like me who is on methadone and uses marijuana to treat my pain and opiate use disorder doesn’t care about people talking about war stories.  You wanna stop hanging out with drug addicts, not form a network of a bunch of them trying to piece days together.

I mean AA and NA are a joke, they are not meant to be taken serious.  Addiction is a chronic disease, and should be treated as such.  Which other chronic disease would you attend a support group with others that have this ailment and just put faith in god to get thru it? If you have diabetes you go to a doctor and he gives you insulin. That is a scientific plausible answer, if you have addiction you should also have your doctor give you a medicine.

I strongly believe that not is NA/AA useless, but indeed detrimental to recovery.  Psychiatry and therapy for underlying issue, a long with medication, and yes will power is what you use to beat addiction.  Yes WILLPOWER I said it, NA tell me to admit I am powerless... ugggh I just can’t stand that such smart people buy into that mess.  I feel so strongly about it because people are literally dying because they are not receiving the correct treatment during the opiate epidemic in our country.  

John Doe is doing 20 bags, goes to a south Florida rehab, comes back, relapses and dies.  This story is repeated over and over again.  The South Florida rehab tells John to attend NA meetings and abstain from all substances, including medication to help with opiate use disorder.  John relapses and overdoses.  Has he been on bupenorphine or methadone his chances of relapse would have been GREATLY reduced, and could prevent it by maintaining somewhat of tolerance for the patience, thus relapse isn’t fatal.

Not to mention that tapering down from bupenorphine or methadone is exponentially easier to do than from most full agonists.  It is often said it is harder, while it may be true if one were to stop these medications abruptly, a slow taper is much easier.  This post will be controversial I know, but if I can prove my point to one person, I feel accomplishment.  This is another situation where science is simply right.",1528430927.0

8pgm6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8pgm6j/lord_of_the_bed_bugs/,18,https://redd.it/8pgm6j,sloan_fitch,Lord of the Bed Bugs,"First a theory. All this time, Cliff is like one of those aliens from 'Men in Black'. Under his football jersey, a mass of small creatues -- thousands of bed bugs operating as one unified organism. Cooperating to hold his clothes up in the shape of a man. Perhaps Cliff is still under the mass of bugs but is emaciated. Yes, he appears to a be an overweight male but that can't be possible. His electricity has been off for a month and he doesn't eat three square meals on any given day. To be fair, when he does order take-out the receipt will exceed $60. Last time he order wings with sides the damage was $90. Thus, it is possible he is not an MIB alien masquerading as a human but read on, maybe the evidence will still support that premise.

&nbsp;

He was sitting in my kitchen for just thirty minutes while he waited for a friend to give him a ride to the pharmacy and now bed bugs are making appearances in my kitchen. Three sightings so far in the past two  days. I saw on on my shirt at work so when I got home I stripped down outside and left my clothes on the patio. While eating I saw one on my new shirt so I contained and killed it. Then I saw one on the counter near the microwave. I suspect that the bugs may have gone into hiding inside of the chair that Cliff sat on. I've dealt with bed bugs in my bedroom once before and successfully contained the infestation but it was quite extreme.

&nbsp;

The solution at the time was to steam all of my bed linens and to wrap the mattress in a special cover that traps bugs and prevents more from seekign refuge within. I then sprinked diatomaceous earth all over the place, and made a perimeter. As a result, the powder would get into the joints of any bug that crosses the line. All was well for nearly a year until I started getting a lot of bites on my neck. This time the bed bugs re-infested but could only seek refuge in my fancy pillow, the MyPillow to be specific. It looked like fucking hell, when I discovered that the pillow was infested I immediately sealed it up in a bag likely never to be used again. The rest of my the room and my bed already had copious amounts of bed bug killing powder sprinkled all over. I was sleeping in the stuff for days prior to discovering the scene on the pillow. 

Sidenote: I took some really nice close-up pictures of the bed bugs and their eggs if anyone wants to see. 


&nbsp;


I ended sleeping in a guest room, well not really a guest room... a bed room that was used when we were children. As one of us moved out it was later used by my mom in her late years since it was not on the same level as the bathroom. As the room is was vacant and free of bed bugs I started sleeping there until I got around to cleaning my own linens and verifying that the bugs were gone. The bed bugs seemed to have been mostly in that pillow so once I sealed them off it was a matter of removing the food source from the remaining population. I've been very lucky not to encounter signs of a re-infestation in the guest room that I've been sleeping in. I've spent far less time hanging out at Cliff's house for a few reasons and it bodes well for avoidance of bed bugs getting in my house.

&nbsp;


Now that a couple of bed bugs appeared in my kitchen, the very room that Cliff sat down in for 30 minutes the other day, I know for certain he brought them here. Such excellent hitchikers those bugs are. Why couldn't they stay on his fat ass? Maybe the smell. He takes few showers since his hot water is non existant and bathroom a mess. When he was in my house his stench left a trail that required me to open multiple windows for cross-ventilation. It smelled like cologne masking a unique stench with a strong transient feet-like odor mixed in. A fucking atrocity I tell you.

&nbsp;

Earlier today I reached out to Derrick to inform him about the hitchhiking bed bugs. He called me back to inform me that he went to Cliff's house twice last week to help his mother get back into bed after falling. Afterwards he discovered itchy bumps on his leg and he didn't know why or how they got there. Upon hearing from me his mystetry was solved and he was grateful. Now hat I told him this, he will most likely never help Cliff get his mom off the floor though I suspect that if Cliff has dope or pills and offers them that he would accept under the right circumstances.


&nbsp;



So is Clifford an alien masquerading as a human. A pile of bugs beneath a mask and some clothing. Propped-up atop one another through a cooperative hive mind but due to the smell a couple of them decided to dessert the army of bed bugs. That or there was at least three bed bugs -- large bed bugs hanging on to Cliff's clothing. Excited by the change in fragrances to have the opportunity to jump ship and attempt to setup roots in a fresh new home. Although Cliff's house has proven to be an excellent incubator of bed bugs, they probably don't like the smell. 

Last time I was at his house I peered through the window and saw flies swarming about through the screen. At the time I thought ""lord of the flies"" but now I think ""Lord of the Bed Bugs"" to be a more appropriate title.

&nbsp;

UPDATE:

Finally, due to requests from more than one reader -- [a picture and an animated GIF](https://imgur.com/a/phKQVVQ). The hard to see white pearly things are eggs and the black dots are probably bug feces. Some of the adult bed bugs seem to be freshly dead, others are more active - especially the hatchlings/infants. 

&nbsp;

Lastly I would direct your attention to the dark gray bug on the bottom left. He must've been dead for a bit longer. Just about all of the dead ones were killed by generous sprinklings of the white powder known as diatomaceous earth. The stuff comes from broken seashells (or something like that) and is very jagged at the microscopic level. As a result, the jagged particles get caught in the soft tissue within the bug's joints thereby causing them to perish. Sort of like a person crawling through pulverized glass.

&nbsp;

What's strange is how there seems to be wet spots beneath some of the dead ones, heck some of the dead ones seem to be embedded beneath the surface of the fabric. Yes, this pillow proved quite hospitable but I'm not so sure they would have setup shoppe like this given other options. Since the mattress was already wrapped in an anti-bedbug mattress case they had no way to see refuge within the mattress or any of the seams of the mattress. 

&nbsp;

Prior to discovering the bugs on this pillow I was getting eaten alive along the back left side of my neck. I initially drew a line of dust around myself which is why quite a few were dead by the time the infestation was visually confirmed.

And ever since he wrote the first guide a few months prior, he told me he wanted to clean it up and make it accessible. So here I am. In his memory, I guess. Because junkies gonna junk. Preface: don't start doing fucking heroin. But since you're here...*


**So you want to snort heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* clean surface [do not use chemicals to clean your surface]

* a card, razor or other cutting device

* optional: scale

* optional: water, preferably sterile

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, start with a match head sized bump. Redose every 10-15mins until you're at a level comfortable for you. If you click better with numbers, 2mg is a good place to start, too. Keep adding 1.5-2mg every 10 minutes until you get to a level you like.

**How to**

* Put preferred amount of dope on your clean surface

* Cut it into a small bump, or a measured bump

* Blow all of the air out of your chest

* Gently sniff one bump into your nostril, don't sneeze, you're going to want to

* Drip a tiny bit of water down your nose: tilt head. Try not to get too much of a drip. This is going to keep the dope from clogging your nose, among other things.

* Repeat until high

---

**So you want to shoot heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* metal spoon/ladle/can bottom

* sterile/cool boiled water

* cotton

* cutting device

* 28-31g needle (higher the better)

* 1cc syringe

* tourniquet (shoelace, latex, phone cord)

* lighter 

* citric acid

* optional: scale

* optional: alcohol wipe

**Dose**

With little to no tolerance, I'd advise that you do NOT start here. However, make sure your dope isn't cut with fent first and foremost. Start with 3mg. This isn't going to be amazing, it's to be safe. If you can't spare two shots, you shouldn't be shooting. You can always add.

**How to**

* Cut how much and put it in your spoon

* Mix with water (just enough to dissolve dope) and wait for mixture to blend, stir a little

* If you have heroin #3 (Afghan, brown), you need citric acid and a flame to make a solution. Add citric to your spoon and heat it up. Stir.

* Put cotton in spoon

* Look for the hole in the needle. Point it down toward the bottom of the spoon, place it on top of your cotton and draw. (This filters your solution)

* Wash those hands and your arm, or try to sanitize the best you can, make sure to alcohol swab if available.

* Tie off your arm -- don't knot it, here's an instructional: https://youtu.be/e9cUspG74eM -- you can do this one handed

* Feel for a good vein, always closest to the crook of your arm. You will know when you get a good one, they're bouncy. If you can't feel it, look for ones bulging through the skin.

* Enter the vein, hole facing up, needle pointing towards your shoulder, almost parallel to the arm, you'll know when you're in

* Register: pull back and watch the little bit of blood enter the barrel.

* Note: if there's PAIN or TINGLING at any point or no blood registering, pull out and try again. NEVER REUSE A DULL NEEDLE.

* Slam that shit (gently and slowly depress the plunger down). Check again if you're in the vein by looking for more blood. With the needle still in your arm, let go of your tourniquet

* Pull out, gently and slowly. It might sting. Wipe your arm, cap your needle.

**Good information right here: http://harmreduction.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/getting-off-right.pdf**

**So you want to ~~boof~~ plug heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* an ass

* oral syringe 

* sterile water

* cotton

* lighter

* citric acid

* optional: lube

* optional: scale

**Dose**

Fair warning that boofing is actually strong as fuck. With no tolerance, I would start at 20-30mg. If you know your snorted dose, use that number.

**How to**

* Follow previous shooting steps. Mix your solution, filter it and draw it up.

* Without an oral syringe, you can use a regular needle syringe. Break the tip off. But seriously, oral syringes are everywhere. Pick one up.

* Lube up the tip

* Lay on stomach, or side.

* Slide it in your bung hole (about an inch and a half) and press the plunger down

* Pull out and lay on your side or stomach for 15ish minutes

---

**So you want to smoke heroin?**

**You will need**

* heroin

* a short straw

* foil

* lighter

**Dose**

You CAN smoke ECP, but you definitely don't want to. [Guide here if you're stubborn.](https://old.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5vmx3a/first_post_ever_how_can_i_smoke_ecp/de3aym4/)

Stick to tar (and gunpowder. You also need to breathe on gunpowder to make it tar, so you can really only smoke tar.) No tolerance, half a pea size ball.

**How to**

* Tear a strip of foil and fold it in half, tear it in half

* Take one half and make v shape boat thing

* Heat the sides of the foil with your lighter, basically where you're going to make it trail.

* Put BTH in the foil, farthest from the corner you're holding it with and closest to your mouth

* Position lighter several inches under foil, away from the dope. You don't want them to touch, you don't want to ignite the dope. Keep your straw close to ball but don't suck it up

* Inch closer to the dope while heating it, it will liquefy and become smoke. Suck that smoke down, don't make the dope too hot and move the lighter away when the flame dies

*This shit takes practice, not gonna lie..*

**DOSAGE CHART: https://drugs-forum.com/threads/complete-list-of-opioid-dosages.12351/**

Some lingo and wise words.

Afghan, #3 - all the same shit. Powdery heroin that's beige/gray and needs to be cooked with citric.

ECP, #4 - gray/brown powder not cut with fent. Can be grayish and sometimes even a very very dark brown depending on where it's from. Almost never pure white, don't trust that shit.

Brown - refers to both ECP and afghan, weirdly.

BTH - black tar, it's, well, black.

China white - don't fucking buy this if you're a newb. 90% of the time it's just fent with like 2% heroin. Which will kill you.

Fent - fentanyl, will literally kill you with no tolerance.

Always practice harm reduction. Never use needles twice. Never share needles. Use the guides and the health information. Always have Narcan on hand. If your state has a needle exchange, use it. If your state doesn't have a needle law, use the pharmacy. If not, go to the exchange. Ask on reddit, there's tons of us that have spares. Buy them on the dark net. Ask your dboy. Anything. Just stay safe, and don't be stupid, especially with this shit.

And please, if you're starstruck with the glitz and glamor of us heroin addicts, enjoy it from afar. It's hell.

General guidlines: if you live on the west coast: you have tar. East coast: ECP. Europe or dark net: Afghan.

I lost my dad last week to a heroin OD. He had been a user for maybe 6-7 years. He had a period of sobriety about 4 years ago for maybe 6 months. I don't know much about heroin use, but I would say he was a maintenance user? He was functional. Sometimes you could tell he was high but for the most part he was okay.

At the beginning of April, things got bad. I guess he got a bad batch, because he was so stoned that he couldn't walk or talk correctly, kept trying to make calls with the remote, etc. After that, it was all downhill. Even after my mom threw out that batch, he continued to get that messed up with new batches. 

My mom and sister came home to find him OD'd in the garage on May 29th. My sister did CPR until the paramedics got there, but they said he was likely gone for a while before they even found him.

My heart hurts so bad. We tried so many times to get him to get help. He was convinced that because he snorted instead of injecting that he wouldn't OD. You can't admit someone against their will.  We talked about shooting him in the foot just to get him admitted so maybe he would agree to get help if he was already at the hospital. It sounds terrible but we didn't know what else to do. But now there isn't anything we can do. My mom lost her best friend. My sisters and I lost our dad. 

Do you think he knew he was dying? I hope he didn't. He died alone in our garage. I just can't believe I have to live the rest of my life without him.",1528424661.0

For the past year or so, I've been living with my girlfriend and her family and working for her dad. Her and I have been full\-time on h (sniffing only) for a few months now and her family just found out. Long story short, the dad had a collection worth some money we thought he wouldn't miss if part of it went missing, but he did. We both feel horrible about it now, we just thought he wouldn't notice. I made a resolution then to never steal again.

Anyway, I got kicked out of the house and fired from my job (naturally) so I've been living out of my car since then. My mom and I went through something awhile back which is why I was living at my girl's place to begin with, so I'm considering trying to make things right with her. I have the rest of this package to finish, but after that I'm gonna try rehab or detox for the first time and see where I land.

My mom knows I have been doing heroin for years now while still managing lately to do great at school/work and stay out of trouble somehow, but she keeps bringing up the same ""gotcha"" point about vacations. She wants to take me, my brother, and my sister-in-law with her and my stepdad to either Mexico or Turks and Caicos, and she always points out that I'll either have to stay home, be deathly ill the whole time, or knowingly involve my family in international drug smuggling. I keep telling her that in that hypothetical situation, I would ramp down my use and/or get on subs or something in the weeks before we leave, but  obviously I'd rather just bring some dope without ending up in a Mexican prison. 

**IMPORTANT DETAILS**: I would only be bringing like $200 worth, not a fuckin kilo or anything wild like that. I have zero concern about visual or pat-down detection as I would wrap it in layers of plastic/small ziplock bags and utilize nature's ladypocket. My ONLY fear would be drug-sniffing canines, which I think sometimes walk around airports and stuff. Obviously heading down to the destination would involve transporting significantly more than the return trip to the US, though we would be flying into/out of one of the biggest international airports in the country.

TL;DR: Has anyone successfully gotten past a canine with ECP on them? How many layers of plastic/ziplock bags should I wrap my bags in before shoving them inside myself to ensure the scent wouldn't be detectable?

They are being wrongfully detained and will be released back into my custody asap. And if anything so much as a hair is touched on them a large lawsuit will come down on the pound. 

I've been dealing with police and endless calls with lawyers today who kept saying they couldn't help only to have one return my call last minute and gladly take on the case. 

I fought for my dogs to the very end and it paid off. I was determined to save them, so to anyone that talked shit about me even having dogs in the first place I'd like to holler a big fuck you to y'all. 

I'm so happy right now. ",1528410849.0

Afraid that I’ll start getting sick towards night time if I stop.,"I started at 30mg and now I’m up to 75mg of methadone which feels like it’s a good dose for me.

Problem is that I’m still copping and using. Not nearly as much as I was before. But I’m trying to stop using completely. 

I don’t even know if I’m really getting high at all at these doses of methadone. I’m just deathly afraid of getting sick at night.

I started out at 30mg then went to 45, then up 5 everyday until I got to 75mg today.

I have noticed that in the morning I start to feel slightly sick. But at night I’ve been snorting dope.

Do you guys think I’ll start feeling more sick later in the day if I stop using dope completely?",1528410143.0

I think to myself ""he'll yeah I just shot the easy load out in my sleep I should be able to tear it up for a good while"" right? Wrong. 

She inserts me into herself and literally, I ejaculated the first two thrusts. Great. We laugh it off as a one off. 5 mins go by and she wants to go again. 

4 thrusts this time until I blow a load. I'm lucky enough to have a girl w a sense of humor but this is still fucking w my head. I'm probably going to jizz 5-6 times today and my gf isn't going to come once. Not fair to her at all. 

Then (bless her heart) she gave me a blowjob. SAME STORY. 30 seconds and her mouth was chalk full of babies. 

This normal for opiates? Have I permanently fucked up the sensitivity of my dickhead. 

I have sense found 2mg of clonazepam to take the edge off.

Some of you may remember my post a couple days ago about being worried about getting cut off for not having paid last month. They allowed me to follow through with my visit today... but something fishy happened. I do a lot of business with a bi polar child’s psychologist, who insists I owe her a ton of money (5000+) for getting me high in times of need. I shared my story with her last night and before I could even tell her, she guessed, and interrupted before I could even explain, 

“Oh they let you walk out without paying too!? Don’t say anything, they did that to me twice and never said anything to me about the money!”

Now, I wasn’t comfortable with that, so that was not my plan. I planned to just ask to speak with the head receptionist in private and let her know what happened and ask for mercy. The receptionist then told me that SOMEBODY told her I had been BRAGGING about not paying. I explained what happened to the receptionist, and she quickly seemed to understand.

Now, this child psychologist bitch is obviously trying to get me cut off. Now, I’ve got half a dozen ideas of how to fuck her over, including but not limited to: her physicians license/board, telling our doctor (I referred her to my doctor when we were still friends), yelp reviews, telling her pharmacy.. I’m thinking I won’t get the doctor involved just in case we both get cut off. I’m curious to see how you guys would handle this, and I’m ready to be petty as fuck.

Here I have almost 55,000 people that I can confide in, seek advice from, or just bullshit with. People who don’t judge me because I use/used opiates. People who will judge me by the content of my character (as it should be in real life).  I have moved passed my addiction (over 6 months clean). It wasn’t easy as we all know. I could not have done it without this sub and the people here.  Special thanks to Tracey. 

To new users, be careful. We love you. Don’t feel alone, you are not alone. I will be coming to this sub for as long as life permits it.  When I first started visiting this site we had just under 10,000 users, two years later we hit 20,000 users, and another two years later we are about to hit 55,000 users.  That will be 55,000 people who have found harm reduction info, and a community that is not found anywhere else online or IRL.


Stay safe y’all and whatever you want, I hope you get it!

After all:  
What exactly do opioids give me other than the pathetic short-term pleasure shared by that gelatinous blob of a man I see parked by the local McDicks every morning, shoveling greasy bacon wraps into his mouth?  
Will I be pleased with the result of five more years habitual opioid use? 
 I actually enjoy withdrawal for the emotional rawness; love watching nostalgic and generally sorrowful films while in that state; why smother the thing that makes me human?  

I smugly contemplated these questions while easy-access sat in the back of my mind - I can find opioids whenever I feel like taking them, right? Apparently not. And now I am feeling irritated and trapped.  

I want to find a source and build a little stash of something legal so this nagging feeling in the back of my head will leave me alone.

I come just to jot down some stuff that revovery sub is kind of lame honestly but whatever works. This sub got me through the darkest times. I remember being isolated after I coped for the day... high all the time sorting through new posts to just bullshit with whoever.
So ive been clean for 112 days. I stated with that mentality I'm done this the longest I've had aince I picked up around the age of 14, now 27. I started working these damn steps, using people, letting people uss me. Ive done alot of shitty things in this short time. About a month ago my mother was  diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer it spread all over. She passed away last Saturday. 

I'm still processing it all. Trying to remember all the good times but isn't it natural to look back and see how much of a piece of shit I was to her, how I stole lied to her, how I pushed her away. When all she did was one thing my whole life gave me unconditional love and wanted to aee me happy.
I did get to be there for her those last to weeks she was in the hospital. I got to cry with her laugh with her and just be there with her. Ill cherish that. I was never there for her. My mom was my hero she was also an addict and had 7 years clean. She was a detox nurae at a rehab, she helped so many.
I'm still processing all this lots of work has been done and alot more to do.

She left alot to me and its save to say of I pick up ill be dead with this type of money. I can have this house in a safe neighborhood where can start a family. It just all means nothing now, and some thoughts come stronger than ever to pick up even though I doubt I have another run in me.

My mom raised me so much stronger than giving in and that would lead me to disappoint her one more time. I just wish I could have been there that morning before she past instead of sleeping in. I wish I could have told her I love her one more time. I remember people who have lost someone in there family Would tell me if yours is still around tell them you love them. I never did, I dont know why. I dont even know why I wrote this. I just know you guys were part of my family for so long. I always felt comfortable here with you.  You really cared and I cared about you all. So if you have a mother still around give her a call and tell her you love her. I wish I could. I love my mom and I miss her so much.

I can pretty much guarantee nothing will ever top this. Ever. This is a long, long story. There will be no TL;DR because the story is too complex.

Let's start with a little back ground info. I have been apart of the /r/opiates community for years on a my throwaway (not this one, for obvious reasons I made a throwaway specifically for this post. It will become more apparent later). 

I have to use a throwaway when I post on this subreddit because I post on other reddits related to my career on my main reddit and the two just cannot be linked. So what is my job? I am an airline pilot. Yes you read that correctly, I am an airline pilot who enjoys the wonderful bliss that is opiates \- more specifically heroin. My method of use is snorting, I have never injected in the \~6 years of heroin use (and another 2\-3 years before that of on and off hydro/oxy but not using as often as I am with boy). The reason I told you all my job (which normally I never mention anytime I talk about opiates) is it an integral part of the ""Luckiest Day of My life"". I have quotations around that for a reason. Not a good reason.

When I am on trips flying I may do some boy and bring it with me, but I am never super high and nodding off. Just a slight buzz, with the majority of my use coming once I am in my hotel room at night while playing video games on my PC or just watching youtube videos.

Now to the story... I packaged my dope to bring thru the airport with me a little different this time. Normally I get stamps, this time it was weight because my plug is transitioning to bagging himself. He didn't bag it this time so he just gave me weight. I put it in a magazine fold, but it isn't super secure so I thought what I could use besides taping it (which would make it annoying to open and close) to keep it secure. My ""genius"" brain thought it would be a good idea to use tin foil. You might be thinking, ""Metal, are you crazy?! The metal detector will go off in the airport!"". Well two things here, 1) We have this special line that both Flight Attendants and Pilots can go thru called KCM (Known Crew Member). It allows us to use this personalized barcode to scan on the TSA computers which will pull up all our info. This in conjunction with our airline ID as well as either your DL or passport, and you don't have to go thru security so that tin foil metal shouldn't be a problem. 2) Although we have this special line that makes it so we don't have to go thru the body scanner/metal detector or get our bags scanned, every 25th and 50th crew member who goes thru KCM will be randomly selected to go thru the TSA PRE line to get their stuff scanned like a regular passenger. But even if this happened to me, I didn't think tin foil would be thick enough metal to even make the detector go off. I was wrong.

Now, I've been randomly selected for this screening before. It was no biggie, I keep the boy on my person and go right thru. I don't have to go thru the body scanner, just the metal detector. Because my stuff is normally in stamp bags, there's nothing to worry about. I've gone thru metal detector before so I know which things on my person and on my uniform that I need to remove because they set off the alarm. I put everything I knew would set it off thru the machine that xrays our luggage. Well when I stepped thru the metal detector, it went off. It was in this moment that I knew I fucked up... This is also where the shit begins to start hitting the fan.

I play dumb at first not knowing what was making the machine go off. Praying it wasn't the tin foil holding my boy, I start removing items hoping that its something random (but knowing full well it is the foil). I take off my shoes, my lanyard, my belt. You name it, I damn near took everything off except my shirt and pants. Eventually there is nothing left to take off. This is where I make my first of very very few mistakes. I ""remembered"" that I had my keys in my pocket, and told the TSA lady (who will end up being a HUGE cunt and thinks shes a police officer) that I just realized I parked my car in the wrong area (random I know, but I was panicking on the inside a little now) and needed to move it ASAP. She could sense I was nervous and started to think something was up. I asked her if I could grab my bag and leave and then come back once I moved my car. She said because my bag had gone thru already, I had to also go thru the metal detector and grab my bag then I could go move my car. But not until the metal detector gave the all clear. Well it kept beeping and I told her I didn't have anything else on me, but I guess she could see the very small bulge from my pocket where the bag was with the boy. She told me to remove what I had in my pocket. I lied and said there was nothing there. She started to get mad and told me to remove it otherwise she was going to call the LEO on duty. I started freaking out more inside now, knowing full well that I've just put myself in a very bad position. I'm in full uniform here, and its starting to escalate to the point where passengers are looking and it's drawing attention. I keep telling her I don't have anything in my pocket (should have just nonchalantly put it in the bowl from the beginning, but this was a mistake I made). She calls the LEO over on her radio, but before he gets there I take the sandwich bag with the tin foil (boy inside) out and into the bowl. She asks why I didn't remove it before, which I responded with saying I didn't realize a thin metal like tin foil would make the detector go off... She's clearly very suspicious of me now, and the LEO is heading over too. I'm. Totally. Fucked. I spent 8 years, and over 100k\+ becoming an airline pilot. I see my life heading for the toilet bowl, felony charges, parents finding out. 

I go thru the metal detector, this time with nothing in my pockets and now its fine. I get to the otherside to retrieve my items, my bag/shoes/wallet/phone etc. have already come out the other end as this was all going on. The bitch TSA lady heads over to where the computers are (that show whats being xrayed) and theres also a small opening where they can grab what comes out of the xray machine before we the passengers can get our items. She of course pulls the bowl with my sandwich baggie of goodies out. She takes a look at the bag and sees the tin foil as well as a straw. Now she's very suspicious, and brings this bowl over to the table where they swab for explosives, along with the LEO. They open it up, see the straw and start to unwrap the the goodies (are your hands sweating yet? Cuz mine are. Imagine being in this situation, I could have thrown up all over them). They open the package and see this powder, and thats when all the questions begin. You might think that I'm done for it here, but I'm actually great under pressure (remember, I'm a trained airline pilot. We are trained to deal with immense amounts of stress while keeping our cool and making correct decisions). This is where I start to save my own ass. They ask (can't remember who, think they're both asking me questions, both the LEO and the TSA coooont) what the powder is, I tell them the name of something I think is a vitamin (think like, DXX (with the XX being a number, because a lot of vitamins are named like that)). They ask why do I have it in powder form, and that it surely isn't being sold like that from wherever I got it. I tell them it came it capsules, but I have trouble swallowing them so I take it out of the capsules to be able to mix into a drink and take them that way. Whats the straw for? Well when you drink the powder sometimes shit gets stuck in your teeth, I don't have toothpicks laying around so I use that to clear my teeth. I tell them, ""remember guys I'm with passengers all day long and it wouldn't look very professional having gunk in my teeth. They ask why I have this in my pocket, that's kind of strange... I explain to them that my luggage goes into a closet on the airplane where we store our crew luggage, and that if I want to be able to take this vitamin during the day while flying I would have to go in and out of the closet which is tedious and could get in the way of passengers as they board and exit. So I keep it on me for ease of use. The TSA lady isn't buying very much, she tells the LEO how nervous and strange I had been acting about taking this out of my pocket. The LEO tells me hes calling a more experienced officer. He does, and I have to explain everything again to the new officer. Whats the straw for, why is it in powder form... I'll spare you. Well this officer in turn calls more officers over. So now we have about 6 total officers all questioning me and asking me the same questions as I explained earlier. Probably so they are filled in, but also to see if my answers remain consistent (thankfully, my wife loves police/detective shows. You'd think it not useful but seriously I've learned so fucking much from those shows that comes in handy in this whole situation). Eventually they inform me they are getting someone to come bring a drug testing kit, because they aren't sure if this drugs or not. But they tell me they don't want to do it out in public (remember, we are still out in public just standing in the area directly after security where everyone puts back on their clothes etc. We start making our way to the back room.

So they told me just prior to coming back here that they were going to be doing a drug testing panel (or whatever its called) on this. I'm thinking I'm 155&#37; fucked. I won't admit to shit tho, because there's absolutely nothing to be gained by giving myself up. I'm just praying to the gods at this point. My wife always wants me to text her after I get thru security if I have anything on me so she knows I made it thru OK. Well she's blowing up my phone worried AF about me. I have my phone on me so I text her back saying I'm totally FUCKED, and that I'm not joking. I also take the time to quickly go thru and delete any and all drug related text messages. So in the backroom is me and about 6 cops, the TSA bitch doesn't come with, because, shes not a cop you know? Nor is it her job to be looking for drugs, just bombs/explosives/weapons etc. But she took it upon herself to do so. So the cops ask for drivers license, flight info, documents etc. They ask to search my bag, I oblige because I have nothing incriminating in it. At this point I ask them if I was free to go. The one most suspicious of me officer told me no, I was being detained. I'm thinking, oh fuck man this is really bad. They re\-ask all the questions over again, which I can only assume is to once again see if my story is remaining the same. Something weird happens in this situation if you are with police getting questioned for over 10\-15 min. You start to calm down after a while. I was doing a pretty good job up until this point giving quick, concise answers without making it seem like I'm having to sit there and think of an answer. But now after its been quite some time since this all started (probably 20\-30 min), I'm pretty calm even tho I know there's a good chance my life may be ruined. I went into this fight/flight response. I was going to fight, and by that I mean I was going to do a great job of lying and making my story seem believable as possible. So once I re answer their questions again I get some new ones. One of the LEOs says ""You do understand why we would find this suspicious right?"" And I'm like, ""No not really man, why?"" and hes says ""This doesn't look like drugs and drug paraphernalia to you?"". This is where all those cop shows really come in handy. Way too often a person in this situation on TV has said ""Why yes it totally does occifer!"" Trying to like meet him halfway or something. I said ""To be honest man, I don't think it looks suspicious but I don't even know what drugs or drug paraphernalia looks like."" Then this guy said the absolute highlight of my very shitty but weirdly good day. He says ""You see, this looks an awful lot like crack."" I had to contain myself boys. Why? Because this boy was a very nice light brown/tan color. I've never fucked with crack, but I do believe crack is like whitish color not light brown/tan... Another officer says ""Okay man, why don't you just go ahead and tell us what this really is"". I repeat myself, telling him its what I have been all along about it being a vitamin supplement. He finds this strange, saying that he's never seen a doctor prescribe someone powder like this before (all while giving me that cop look that says I'm a dumb asshole trying to make him look stupid or something). I, along with another cop in the room, explain that I said before I got it over the counter and it wasn't prescribed. I explain to him that this was recommended to me by the guy at GNC when I told him that it's hard for me to eat healthy while on the road due to the fact that I eat a lot of fast food. This was suppose to be an additional vitamin source to round out my diet. Additionally, I told him before it came in capsules already crushed but I can't swallow them so I open them up and keep them like that. All while this guy is grilling me with his two other buddies, 3 more are in the other room doing what I think is a drug test on the powder.

Eventually the 3 from the other room come in, and to my very very very very surprise, told me I was free to go... I couldn't believe my ears. I got up and asked if I could put my bag back together since they had taken the stuff out of it and was out on the table. They said yes. On the other table was a small circle bin (that used for wallets, phones etc) with my wallet, belt, and my boy package which was sitting open. They said I could take it all, including my vitamins... I couldn't believe my ears. So I wrapped my ""vitamins"" back up, with 4\-5 cops standing around me watching me (couple had left). Just to seal the deal here, I asked the room if I was going to get an apology now? The room was quiet, one of them changed the subject and told me that I Just needed to go back out to TSA so they could screen my bag again. Well I went and did that with an officer, and sucked up to the TSA lady. Apologizing to her for not just complying originally, and I shook her hand. Once my bag came out of the scanner, I was on my way, vitamins in tow and all. I called in sick for my trip, no way I could fly after all of that.

And that ladies and gents, was how I had the luckiest day of my life. I don't think I will have a luckier day than that for the remainder of my days. 

I do apologize for the length, but in order for you all to grasp this story and the emotional roller coaster, I had to be super detailed.",1528315512.0

I pull out the broken Samsung tablet which for the last 2 years has been used exclusively for breaking down and holding drugs, primarily opiates; same old story, started out with a script of hydro for a compressed disk in my lower back, slowly came to be a good friend of heroin and fentanyl. Upon inspection of the tablet I see that junky-me from the night before only left sober-me enough to be well for about half of the 8 hour shift of hard labor ahead of him, itll have to do. I quickly get dressed, grab my bag, text my boss that I'm omw and head out for the day.

Usually at this point I would smoke a bowl or some wax from my g pipe on the ride to work, however finances have been tied up elsewhere lately. I finish the 15 minute drive to my boss's house, essentially sober, and we begin discussing crews for the day. Once I see the roster of workers for the day I immediately know which team I'm on. N is the crew lead of my team and for a good reason; our team all love to get fucked up. Before we even begin discussing the nature of today's jobs N informs me that we have an eighth of some very dank weed as well as adderall. Fucking right. N stops me and says eventually I have to get him back for bringing the drugs. I remind him of the 6mg of klonopin I gave him a week ago, empathetic to him not remembering, having taken them all at once. 

We finalize jobs and teams and start to head out for the day. N takes out a bag of about 15 Adderall 20mg IR pills before we get off the street. ""One each. I'm being stingy today,"" N tells us as he hands the bag over to me. No problem, adderall hasn't even been on my radar since starting using dope about 6 months ago so anything is a nice surprise. I ask N if he could get more of them and if he can get anymore klonopins. ""Well I was being extra stingy with these, I need my downers more than the adderall,"" he says, revealing another bag with about 8 2mg Klonopin tablets and says ""just one, and only for you since you hooked me up before,"" today is starting to look up.

I immediately swallow the small dose of benzos, hoping it would do absolutely anything to potentiate/increase the duration of the joke of a line of dope I had to start my day. Once the Kpin goes down the hatch I immediately begin the familiar ritual of crushing the adderall pill with the bottom of a bic lighter onto the screen of my phone. It had been a long while since i crushed a pill to snort but it still felt like second nature. Cover, crush, flatten with lighter, chop; your line is ready. I start on the multiple attempts it takes to finish snorting the adderall. I know itd be easier to just swallow it since you lose 80% of it to drip anyway but at this point I was more satisfying the junkie urge of using my favorite ROA, something I'm sure people here can relate to.

We arrive at one of the giant truck stop/gas stations that have been popping up everywhere so that we can get drinks, smokes, gas, etc. As usual we all seem a bit discoordinated in the back of the store fumbling around trying to find the cheapest combo of drinks to satisfy the 4 of us. Check out is just as awkward. As soon as we finish pumping gas, assistant crew lead, D, starts rolling a blunt. D can be a bit annoying at times but is overall a good solid guy and he gets some very high quality bud and wax which can be somewhat hard to come by in a state as anti marijuana as ours. We head out and D sparks the blunt of top shelf sativa dom hybrid.

We start passing the blunt, everyone agrees we're starting to feel the adderall and today is starting to look like a great day. Even with the tiny ration of dope I had to get me through the work day I have to admit, I was starting to feel pretty good. We all start having conversations, mostly about drugs and I thank them for helping almost achieve my ultimate combo of drugs, I tell them I wish I had more ""opiates"" however to finally top it off. I say ""opiates"" specifically because everyone here has a very negative opinion of heroin, seeing as N's brother OD'd and died on it. Even around other drug users a dope fiend has to be careful and discreet.

We drive for a while, the whole time I can feel the Adderall slowly ramping up to the smooth amphetamine high I had once been so familiar with. I had eaten a hot breakfast sandwich to aid in the digestion of the klonopin from earlier. The long onset is my least favorite part about klonopin other than the constant redosing and blacking out.

As I start to feel the haze of the clonazepam wash over me and combine with the pseudo-speedball effect I realize that if I hadn't been so greedy the night before I could be in a state of bliss for the day but maybe its best that things worked out this way. Tonight is payday and I can get even with my dope man and finally get a decent bag of boy, even if it's on a front, just to repeat the cycle with.

I know the max daily dose is 4,000mg and I try not to go above that, but sometimes I'll take like 3,200mg at once. Sometimes that makes me feel sick, but I can't tell if that's cause of the opiates or the APAP.

I'm trying to cut down now and do CWE, so that should help. But am I already fucked? I'm young and I have lot of pain and fatigue, but I think otherwise I'm fairly healthy (aside from my terrible diet). 

Is it likely that I did significant damage to my liver that's worth telling my doctor about? ",1528255204.0

""How long to wait after taking suboxone before I can _____""
""How long does suboxone prevent other opiates""
And varies other search questions but wasn't able to find the answer I was looking for.

Okay, so today I was on day three of being dope sick and wasn't able to get well before work, so I had to take suboxone to make sure I could get through the day. Now my homie and boyfriend are picking up a gram here in six or so hours.

Anyways; so my question. I took 12MG of sublignal pellets of bupe  so a total 12mg bupe and Nalox 3mg, so Im wondering- how long do I have to wait before I can enjoy my dope?

Im overall pretty irritated at this fact because I didn't want to take Subs for this exact reason, and honestly I don't even feel all that better like I thought I would.. everywhere online says 3 days to a week! That doesn't seem right because I remember doing subs one day and doing dope the next and getting high.

About six months ago, I found a very compassionate pain doctor; started me off with 90 10 mg oxycodone per month, and bumped me up to 90 15s the very next month; in fact, I’m due to get bumped to 60-90 30s next month. Problem is, I’m broke; this doctor only accepts cash, and gives you the boot if you miss two appointments; this will be the first visit I have missed outright, but I had to cancel one month previously because, just like this month, I didn’t have the money. I’m very worried, because being that I’m very young, I don’t think I’ll ever get as lucky with finding another doctor again.

To top it all off, I have a very large settlement check coming in two to three weeks from a bad car wreck, I just don’t think it’s at all likely they will let me slide on paying for a few weeks. Normally, I get a bit of help in paying for most, of not all of my script; however, this month, my usual benefactors are unable to help also.

Guys, I really don’t want to lose this doctor, please cross your fingers and pray to junkie Jesus for me. I’m really stressing here. I promise, if this somehow works out, I’ll do a few extra in script day just for you guys.

Why does it have to be so hard to find (and KEEP) a doctor who will give you the help you need?

And, an idea for some of you who have decent credit!","So, my pill lady texts me this morning and tells me that someone has Norco. Husband tells me he doesn't think there's any money in the bank and goes to sleep (he works graveyard).

I only have $25 in my pocket, I'm freakin out, wondering how I'm going to get money! I start Googling about how to get a cash advance on a credit card, because I've never done it before. So, they (citibank, where I have the credit card through) tell me all I have to do is go into ANY bank with my credit card and ID and they will hand me money! 
Cha-ching! 😍
Except... They denied it LMAOOOO! I asked for $140 and you can only get $50 on that particular credit card, and I didn't have any of my others with me! 😱😭😱😭 (you can even get cash advances on a Walmart credit card, I did not know this! Not at the bank, but still lol) 

My lady is blowing up my phone wondering where I am! I'm sweating in the bank, trying not to cry lol!! And then, I remember PayPal Credit!! I check my bank account to make sure there is SOME money in there, and there is, thank you JJ lol. 
I transferred money to one of my internet kids with instructions to send all but $20 back to me, ($20 for her trouble!) and then I transfer that from PayPal to my bank, withdrawal most of the cash that's in the bank and call my lady.

She said she's at the welfare office and to meet her there, but I have to come in because she can't miss her number being called?! So she wants to sell me pills in the lobby of the medicaid office! 😱😂😱😂😂😂 Anxiety kicks in full force, I know they probably have security and cameras in there!!! But... 
LIKE I'M GOING TO SAY NO!! 
I get crazy looks parking at the welfare office in a brand new Camaro, someone asked me if I worked there as I got out of my car!! I have insane anxiety with no opiates in my system  and I don't wanna talk to you, lady!! No, I don't work here, I'm here for a drug deal! Lmao! 
I get inside and she's talking to someone who hands her a clipboard with papers. She sees me and hands me her purse and says, ""can you find me a pen mama? In the side pocket..."" so I see the crumbled up napkin in the side pocket, I know the pills are in there, I take them and replace them with the money, including her finder's fee lol, and then hand her a pen out of her purse, hug her and leave. 😂😂😂 Not as scary as I thought lol. 

Anyway, thanks for reading that ramble... Now, some info!! If you have a PayPal account, linked to your bank account... Apply for PayPal credit! They gave me a THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR CREDIT LIMIT!!! I've used most of it for pills, honestly, but... If you have someone you can trust, it's an easy way to get money into your bank account if you need money in your bank account!! The minimum payment is like $50 a month, and paying even the minimum keeps my credit looking good. 
I send money to one of my internet kids, with a little extra for her, and she immediately sends it back to my PayPal account, and then I transfer it to my bank. If you send it via ATM card, at some banks, it only takes a few minutes to show up in your account. My bank is super anti fraud and safe etc, so it takes 24 hours for it to show up. But, thankfully, there was some money in my bank and I didn't have to wait 24 hours lol. But, the money will be there tomorrow (I've done this before) and nothing is scheduled to come out of the bank until next week, so leaving only $25 in there is ok and husband can't get mad at me lol. (I'm hoping he doesn't get mad anyway, I'm about to go wake him up Lmaoooo) 

If you have any questions about PayPal credit, feel free to ask!! And, if you shop online, you can use a PayPal balance for most things online as well, without transferring to your bank, so this could be helpful for some of you who use the darknet or whatever it's called! 

Sorry for the long post, I'm very happy that my anxiety is gone and I can get some shit done today instead of crying in my bed watching Netflix and checking my heart rate all the time lol. Fuck anxiety! 
I hope you're all doing well. Stay safe and happy nods! 💖💖

The other day I got super sick because the bags I had the day before weren't good so I got sick fairly quick. Woke up at 4 AM and couldn't fall back asleep so I had to occupy myself til 9 AM til I could get to the bank cuz I lost my debit card.... It was pretty damn shitty and even driving out to the hood I was thinking to myself, ""I can't do this!"" But once I started to get close, I got that motivation going and pushed onwards. Once I got those bags, I immediately got to work ripping em open to ingest that wonderfully evil powder... **(Side note: When you're sick, you get reckless like that- everyone knows it. I don't think anyone can say that they haven't at least ONE TIME gotten high immediately after picking up the dope, whilst still in the hood, even if it's not a good idea. You can be the most careful person and be super strict about not using in the hood, but you know there's been that ONE time that you just couldn't wait.)**
Anyway, I digress. Like I was saying, I ripped open those damn bags, driving with my knee and all, dumped out three, and sniffed em. Even though I didn't feel them yet, my mind was completely at ease. A few minutes later I felt all of the sickness melt away and could go on with the day.

As much as I hate it, that damn relief going from sick as hell to well is amazing. But I was thinking.. how could you explain that to someone that has never been through it? It's pretty easy to explain how it feels to be sick, and how it feels to be high. But how do you explain that sweet feeling of relief? How can you put that into words- that moment the opiate hits your brain, and all of your sickness goes away, and all is right with the world for a little while once again?",1528244144.0

---

It was a cold, dreary and especially frightful day in March. I had been on an extremely powerful euphoric painkiller know as Fentanyl for three months straight at this point. What a Christmas I had, nodding all over the milk and cookies. As I sat on the toilet either shitting my bowels out or pumping out some hemorrhoids due to constipation (so back in forth I can’t recall which in particular it was), I decide for the penultimate time, that times are gonna be a-changing. I can’t live this way. My supply is limited. This gift basket I found in the streets isn’t gonna hold me for long. 

[This basket of drugs is akin to “the suitcase” from Pulp Fiction. Get used to not knowing about it. Happy to hear your theories.]

As I stare through blurry eyes at my ever-reddening foot, I finally feel the warmth from the already used patch of fentanyl flowing through me. It’s kinda like heroin if heroin were in the middle of a snowstorm. The fentanyl buzz is cold, grey and devoid of that blankety feeling of the morphine family. However, that bitch packs quite the punch. I began nodding off on the toilet, a la Elvis Presley, as I went into a daydream. I saw myself up on a stage with the floodlights all beaming up on me like the sunshine for my soul. I had no doubt just done a shot of heroin in backstage before coming outside and plucking away on my Sigma acoustic guitar, playing some old worn out love songs which never leave my soul. In this dream inside a dream, I begin to ponder past loves, mainly my first. A beautiful blonde girl from the mountains with a heart as golden as her locks. This girl was my best friend. If only I could have been more of a man (and not a girl pants-wearing emo f****t), I think, I would have had her. If I would have had her, I never would be in this position. There’s no way! Someone that smart, pretty and intelligent and loyal would never allow my character to be diminished by my self-destructive alternate personality. Suddenly I come to, as the dream “me” kicks out the lights and the crowd abruptly stops. 

“Hey b, you done in there?”, my mother calls out to me in the sweetest of tone. I come to, slurring “yes mom, be out in just a second.”. I quickly wipe my ass even though there’s nothing on the paper. I had forgotten the entire reason I was in here was just to sit on that heater. [the heat from the space heater on my skin / the transdermal patch causes the speed of delivery to increase greatly.] I do a double take at the door, making sure she isn’t looking inside for some odd reason. Then I carefully unplug and pack up the heater back into the closet. What excuse do I have for that? “I’m too cold to take a shit?” I wash up under the dual sinks in my plush middle class home, wiping my hands on the purple (everything is purple here) hand towel above. “Damn, did you fall in?”, my father jokes. I quickly retort with a lie. “No I've just been eating a lot of cheese lately, you know how that goes...”. “Oh God.”, my father says disgusted. He knows I have IBS-constipation. He just doesn’t know exactly why it has gotten a lot worse in the past few months. [You know, this is a recurring side effect in my use which has got to be the worst hell I can imagine in this life.]
Anyway, little did I know it, but today would mark the day of my last taste of this sweet and sour chemical I had grown so bitterly fond of. The plans were set in motion for a friend, C, and I to go a mutual friend, J’s house. Now J was a newly christened weedhead. C and I were veterans who had recently introduced him, and he was kind enough to invite us back to get high on his dime. This was during a period in all of our lives where we were all in the early college days and preferred to not remember much of each of those days. Not for any reason in particular, only for the sheer fun we had. Putting on beats, hitting bongs, drinking a couple Bud Lights and freestyling. Calling some girls over (J was a lady’s man with his family’s money and his high metabolism six pack abs). Getting jerked off while hitting a blunt. Ahh… This was the life, we thought. Well, that was last time I was there... This time I’m showing up (without my any of my friend’s knowledge of it) as a junky. It’s crazy what a matter of mere months can do to change a person, when putting on the narcotic brakes every day until ending up with the body of an elderly person who needs prunes every day just to drop the Browns off at the pool, and not even miss Mary Elizabeth Winstead herself could get me to bust a nut right now on this amount of fentanyl. 

C and I began packing our stuff up out of my room in my parents house where we all have been staying as of late (I had a few different goons living over during this time period). We made damn sure to get the bong from out the closet, definitely gonna be needing that. I make sure to slide back into my room after we leave because I forgot something. Take a guess what. I go up under my audio receiver and slide the remaining three used fentanyl patches into my bag. (Wait… had I forgotten the two I’m already wearing on my foot..? It would seem so). Since I am what I am, I go ahead and slice up one patch, putting each half on each side of my mouth, buccally. Usually I would leave them there for a bit and see how they do. If I'm not satisfied, and never am, I would chew on them quite a bit to really get the juices flowing. This day I was chewing like this pain patch was fucking double bubble. I gotta be sociable tonight! I slide another cut piece or two into my pocket for later use. Goodness knows I’m not gonna go this entire, dreary car ride without another piece!

Now, for the sake of harm reduction I would like to say my friend was driving. However it was my car. He knew I was fucked up, just didn’t know how or why. I vaguely recall me driving to the end of my parent’s road, just out of sight and switching spots with C. He told me to pack a bowl for the road, so of course I obliged. His weed after all. We cruise on out of our rural “village” as we call it, past the whole three red lights, past the banks, funeral homes and fast food/gas stations which are all that make up this town anymore. We pass the two cops that are on duty in the entire town, sitting at the Hardees parking lot (probably gossiping). I discreetly slide the bong down out of sight, and that’s really all there is to it around here. Sure, you get unlucky, but for the most part in our town, cops are lazy and just don’t get a fuck. Props, I guess..?

We finally hit the on ramp to the interstate, turning right directly past the Arby’s, and we’re gliding now. My little Honda Accord is trucking along, zipping past the semi-trucks. I trust C’s driving skills more than I trust my own. The kid has played so many damn video games his reaction skills must be at peak performance, even with the herb in his system. That shit ain’t slowing us down anyway. Just another thing we do to feel “normal”. We float on past the “Northern drivers” as we call them, mostly older people going on some kind of retirement trip, I imagine. Ahh, what normalcy must feel like. Keep in mind these people do about 60mph in the fast lane [no offense to all my northern friends. Love yall <3]. C pays no mind, he is inside of Crazy Taxi right now, and I’m inside my own narcotic dream, slowly turning nightmare. I take one last gaze out up the mountains where I grew up, right below us as we climb above, higher and higher on this interstate. For a brief moment, I envision what my life would have been like had I never touched that first pill. My daydream is soon interrupted by a phone call from J. I answer. 

“Hey bro, where you guys at? Have you passed the first exit yet? Okay, no? So get off there first and I’m gonna let you meet my new girl”. We hang up. Well, this is an interesting twist. I motion for C to get off at the next exit, a small stop with only a couple truckstops, gas stations and maybe one restaurant. J was at this Mexican restaurant after a dinner with his bae, so we pull in there. Out of the corner of my eye, I see this girl of his in the back corner of this parking lot next to J’s Camaro, and I immediately felt all my past loves were reincarnated inside of her. 

Enter Katy… another dazzling blonde bombshell from the mountains (does it seem I have a type here?) with blue eyes like diamonds. She was wearing a tight, white wifebeater which fit snugly on her model body. It was obvious this girl does squats, among other things. She wore a cross necklace, a devout Christian as most “good girls” are around here. She wore Daisy Duke short shorts and a pair of sandals which would only be fitting to wear to church. After snapping myself out of a trance, I finally tell C “let’s go” as we both step out of the Honda. We crawl over to where J is standing beside his super sleek orange sports car. Before we are even halfway over to him, he yells out “hey dudes, this is Katy. She wants to smoke!” We get there, and I’m pretty sure C and I both said simultaneously, “uhh… sure.” We were both likely at a loss for words, in awe of the sheer beauty in front of us. In that moment, I thought, I could see the pain in this girl’s eyes. Something I recognized that no one else could, just maybe for a moment, she saw mine too… 

[I used her name because if she somehow ever reads this, I want her to know how sorry I am. I’m so sorry I strained your relationship. I’m so sorry I scared the life out of you on a night which was supposed to be all fun and games. I’m sorry for everything.]

We sat around on the curb for a bit as J and Katy leaned against the Camaro, shooting the shit with them. Just basic getting to know one another small talk, so that hopefully her anxieties about smoking diminish. She had never had a bong, or good weed, but she had once upon a time hit some ditch weed out of a joint. That’s nothing, baby, we got medical. C and I were infamous in the tight-knit crew we ran with for being serious fucking stoners (simultaneously being the worst stoners ever, always forgetting a lighter, pipe, papers, or something). We were the only ones we knew of in our area with even a dank connect there for a while. No one would believe us when we tried to tell them it’s 20/gram, until they got a taste. Anyway, I’m sure we talked some about all this to them, how we got the best shit mailed straight from Cali, blah blah. We then parted ways as J says “just follow me once we get off the next exit, so I can show you where I live now”. 

We cruise behind J as we get onto the on ramp, cross some more mountains, a couple more exits to some boondocks-type places, until finally here we are at our exit. We turn right, then go through a couple red lights (much bigger stops than our town has), and eventually make a blind right turn into what seems like a drop off, where it is so dark and my vision is so blurry. C whips it in there with no issues of course, and before we know it we are at J’s house. It’s a modest little cottage type home, with a 90 degree drop for a driveway, and J’s older jeep (which he mainly drives; he’s modest for a rich guy) sits in that driveway. We all hop out quickly, anxious to get that first fat bong rip. In the midst of the excitement, I had forgotten my bag in the car which contains most of my illegal stuff. I must have gotten all the fent patches out of it when we stopped earlier. I was seriously eating the things like candy. Who needs sour patch kids when you can just chew on straight drugs?

Being the gentleman that he is, J unlocks the door on his little cottage home, allowing katy, C and myself to walk in first. Immediately we are greeted by his little dog, I don’t care to remember the breed. I’m a “big, outside dog” type of guy. I normally would be thinking, “great, i’m gonna have a field day with allergies on this stay.” However, I was too high to care, about anything. J immediately offers us a beer, and not to be rude we both take one gladly. I don’t remember much from this point on. Surprising, huh?

I just remember after getting settled, we all end up gathered in J’s “smoking room”. He is the type of dude to go all out for everything he does. So he has neon lights, a speaker/laptop setup for youtube, a futon to sit on, and a few chairs. So of course C and I are sitting in the floor, as I pull out the bong from C’s backpack and see their eyes light up. I pass it to C, he passes it to them to inspect, while I’m rolling a joint (just for chill’s sake), and he is grinding up even more for a bowl. I remember how easily rolling this joint came to me while I was fucked up beyond belief. Usually my nerves would prevent me from rolling to perfection, but not tonight.  As the reefer smoke helps illuminate the neon room, I can’t help but get an overwhelming urge to nod off into oblivion. I think they noticed that, but it didn’t stop us from having a few in depth conversations about the universe, life, and Snickers bars. The last story I remember was told by Katy. She told of the time her little sister was taken away from her all to soon, in a tragic fourwheeling accident. I had heard of this all over the news, but didn’t realize she was part of that family. She didn’t cry, only appeared numb to it all now. “There it is”, I thought. “that pain I saw...” Everything made sense now, as I take a final sip from my brew and a final drag on the joint. 

I now realize that J and Katy had actually retired to their room long ago at this point. C looked down at me from atop the ottoman. “Dude, what the fuck are you on?”, he finally asks firmly. “Ah, nothing man, I’m just so tired. That weed be hittin’, yo”, I replied, completely full of shit. After shaking his head and asking if I need anything, he tells me to get up on the futon at least so I can sleep. I ask him to put Family Guy on a loop. He found some sketchy streaming site to do so (didn’t have all my private torrent sites like back home). I dragged my drugged, useless body up there. I truly don’t think I was ever one-hundred percent on this futon by the way. When I passed out, the last thing I remember was “shut up, Meg” as my lower torso was determined to slink its way off of the furniture for some reason. I want to think in those last few moments of lucidity, I thought about my mother (how good she had been to me), and my first love (how good I had been to her), and all my friends and good times in between. I wanted to think I begged for God to save me... I didn’t. In fact I wasn’t thinking anything, in retrospect. As my one open eye came to a final close, I saw the illuminated glow of the Griffin family house on the laptop in front of me for one last time…

...fade to black.

**part 2:**

Blackness. Darkness all around me. That’s all it was. If anyone ever tells you any different about how an overdose feels, they’re lying. It’s completely painless, so at least we can take solace in the facts that those we love feel a brief reprise from the sorrow and the hurt in this world, just a glimpse before they make their final exit. Lucky for me this wasn’t my curtain call. Life wanted me here for an encore. I still haven’t quite figured out why. Maybe it’s so I can be here to write this very experience down, in some desperate attempt to subdue everyone’s thoughts of remaining in this game. This is what it inevitably leads to. 

I’m not sure why or even how my friend C awoke to call the ambulance that night. Maybe it was instinct. We’re first cousins and have been inseparable since birth. We’re best friends, but beyond that we’re brothers. Ha, he would laugh at my sentiment. I’m not laughing at what he did for me that night, however. I wouldn’t be here today if he wasn’t such a light sleeper. He later explained to me, over a dank bowl, that he was awoken to these god-awful noises. These guttural, clinging to life gasps for breath. I was dying but by God, I was fighting it. I’ve never been much of a fighter. I save my energy for the real battles. It’s a good thing I did. 

After what I imagine to be a hectic, nerve-wracking ambulance ride, I was awoken to flashing white, fluorescent lights and the gossiping of nurses. “What a waste of such a young life, how stupid, who would do this to themselves, such a handsome young man, too?” I kept hearing these sounds of betrayal. I was living in a nightmare, that was all. Everything felt so cold and unreal. I felt dissociated from my reality entirely. It turns out a lot of this could have been due to the narcan. They had given me one shot, I presume, but they were not done yet. They had to make sure, I guess. [I dunno as I’m not a medical professional (yet). I just know a lot about drugs (my general doctor told me I know more about addiction than him.]

The room was full of nurses. I felt like the center of attention for once, but for all the wrong reasons. The room was so small, brightly lit and only separated from the rest of the hospital wing by a couple teal curtains hanging from the ceiling for privacy. I look over to the left, as my neck cracks with soreness from doing so (must have been the hours I spent passed out, hanging halfway off a futon). I observe a pile of my clothes which I remember having on before. I was now hooked up to machines, trapped in place wearing only my Family Guy boxers. I’ll never forget that day when I look at those boxers. I think I ended up throwing them out due to all the holes I had worn into them from days out fighting this silly war of the mind.

I hear a new set of voices outside, as I finally start to open my eyes and actually observe my surroundings. Of course the first thing I notice is the tube in my throat, which feels like the greatest violation of life I’ve experienced (even over the catheter in my dick hole). There are no words for a writer to describe the feeling of third party source doing your living for you. These voices continued, and I eventually made them out to be some type of authority figures. It actually turns out that I was the suspect in a crime which had coincidentally happened that same night. I would later learn that some kid broke into a local vet’s office (he slid through the doggy door. Not making this up) to steal some tasty ketamine. Now at this point in my addiction, I would’ve honestly believed it was me. My mind was so shattered right now I didn’t know what to believe. “This is still just a nightmare”, I assured myself. How wrong I was. 

As the nurses crowd around me, one of them says something to the effect of, “okay honey, get ready. we’re gonna give you some more medicine and you’re probably gonna feel a shiver”. Fucking shiver, my ass. That second dose of narcan must have been huge. I understand why they had to, but dear God did I wish they hadn’t in the minutes afterward. Months of fentanyl buildup ripped out in mere moments. I remember projectile vomiting over and over, and each time it would somehow slide out of my mouth, past the tubes. It was black bile and pieces of a Wendy’s burger (the only thing I had eaten in the last day or two) which coated the dreary, plain white tile floor below. What a morbid spectacle, a work of art this was. They explained that the black part was the charcoal they gave me, after my hypochondriac mind inquired. Either that or dried blood. I was terrified. I begged for mercy. “Please take these fucking tubes out. They are killing me!”. No good. Most of these nurses were assholes to me just to be honest (not for this reason, but the way they talked about me while I was “out” really hurt my feelings). I know this isn’t the case for all, and I can’t even blame them for their cynicism. How many young lives like mine had they lost here on this very table? I don’t want to know. 

After an extremely painful attempt to piss through my catheter, they offered to let me contact my family. At this point no one in my family even know for sure I was using, so I was extremely vigilant to not contact anyone whatsoever (I don’t know what I was thinking in hindsight). I think I just wanted to die right there without anyone ever knowing. How fucking selfish of me…

Meanwhile, back at J’s house, cops were ripping through the entire house in search of their precious missing ketamine. Apparently they treated every overdose case that night as a suspect. Now, remember how I mentioned J was a new pothead? Well I ruined that for him. He managed to hide all his shit in time before the cops arrived, so he was in no trouble. He could just claim ignorance. Not with his parents however. His parents basically knew he was up to something drug related just by the fact I was staying over there. He had to admit his usage of weed to them, which presumably did not go well at all. His parents are the hard ass, traditional, southern hard-working Christian types. Well, mine are too, but mine had become used to the let downs by now. J was the perfect child until now. His parents’ world was shattered this day as well as my parents’. This ruins the relationship. [Hey man if you’re out there, i’m really sorry for what it is worth. I know you can forgive me, I only hope as time goes you can forget.]

Back to the scene at hand, I’m trying to convince the nurses that I don’t need to contact anyone. Well, I didn’t realize that C would contact my family anyway (of course). I heard it later from my sister what happened there. The conversation basically went like this: J or C called my house phone. I think my sister answers. They tell her that the ambulance just took me to the hospital. They aren’t sure why or that I’m even alive, but had to let you know. My mom proceeds to absolutely lose her mind, yelling at the top of her lungs and likely thrashing around her bedroom. Just primal rage which was triggered by the thought of her only son being dead in a gutter somewhere, by his own hand. My family all hop in their nice and cozy SUV and high tail over to check on their piece of shit son. At this time, I’m still ignorant to this fact and am wrapping my head around the realness of it all. I still don’t believe this, and no one can make me. 

Time goes by, more doctors and nurses visit me. One doctor says I have what he likes to call “Alice in wonderland syndrome” which is oddly enough the euphemism he used to describe opiate overdose. It made sense to me at the time. I wasn’t too far off from that opium smoking caterpillar. Only he didn’t die (or maybe he was dead. Maybe all of Wonderland were just the lost souls of those overdosed in this wicked game). However, it wasn’t quite my time to pack my things and move in there, yet. My day pass had suddenly expired. 

What happens next is an image forever imprinted into my medial temporal lobe. Every single time I think of using or do from here on out, I see these ghostly faces in my rear view mirror staring back at me: the faces of my family and friends as they trudged into my hospital room that day. First I see J’s father (who had charismatically witted his way into my room by claiming he was my preacher. It comes natural to him and his son to talk their way into anything), and then my poor mother, and behind her, my sister. My father was nowhere to be seen. My mom immediately runs over and hugs me as I just keep uttering “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry...” as well as I can through this satanic device crawling down my throat to my lungs. I ask where my dad is eventually. “Oh, he’s outside talking to the police. They wanted to question him.” “what?!”, I ask confused. “Yeah, apparently someone stole a bunch of tranquilizes or something from a local vet last night. They think it might have been you.” I don’t think she considered that it was actually me for a second. She never even asked what had happened to me. She knew, and maybe she had known for a while. That’s the thing. Mothers always know, so you’re best off to just tell ‘em the truth from the start in my experience. It hurts them worse to lie. 

Slowly but surely, the rest of my family begins to show, and I have to be excused every few minutes to forcibly empty my bladder through the little suctioning tube inside me (that doesn’t feel natural either, obviously, but has nothing on these throat tubes). My grandparents on both sides, my aunts, cousins, and all the rest showed eventually. J and Katy even made a small appearance to check on me. That was the last time I would see them. Their relationship and lives in general were forever scarred by my selfish accidental almost-death. J’s parents would never look at me or him the same again either, knowing I (the devil that I am) turned their son onto “drugs”. Of course I always told him how dangerous pills are and recommended him never try. Pot wasn’t a drug to me though, and still kind of isn’t. I mean it can’t kill me, so how can it be the same as this soul-crushing bullshit? My opinion on it will never change theirs, though. 

Around the time everyone began showing up, I was eventually stabilized and allowed to move to my own hospital room. The nurses and my family could sense how badly I craved to get out of this room, which had become my own personal hell in the last few hours. The pain, the bleakness, and the utter loneliness I had experienced seemed to leave me as soon as I left that little corner of the ER. I took this as a sign God was watching over me, washing all the sorrow and woes away in a brief instant as some pretty nurse wheeled me throughout the ER floor through narrow corridors until eventually reaching an elevator. I felt that elevator ride was a metaphor for my life from this point out. I’m definitely done with using drugs, so I can only move up in life right? I only wish that were true. I’d be lying if I said I quit for good that day. 

I reach my hospital room finally, and I'm resting on the bed made special for me. I’ve spent a lot of time in hospitals in my life, mostly as a child. I always had this strange love for them. I loved the pity. Such a sad, lonely boy I was and still am. I would take pity over no attention at all. Lord knows I got plenty of it this day. I had so many hugs that my torso was beginning to go numb. The day progressed with a few more visitors, small talks and prayers and even some nice gifts. Everyone was just so thankful I made it. It wasn’t until later on (a few months clean) I was thankful as well. I had a long chat with my mom after everyone left about my drug use. We agreed that I should stick to weed only, especially if it would help me stay sober from opiates. 

Now I don’t mean to get on a high horse, but many people probably can relate here. After a dance with death, a person will never look at life the same. It’s like seeing first hand just how fragile our existence really is. I ventured into the blackness, and ran straight back out, as fast as I could towards that white light. The blackness was easier. It was pain free. It was everything free. It was nothing. 

...but life is more than that. It’s something. It is a lot of things. It is love, loss, and everything in between.

---

I love each and every one of you reading this. If you’re going through the struggle, I only hope my grim tales can influence you to reconsider that next shot, line or smoke. It is a constant thin line between the blackness and the white light of serenity that will always exist for each of you on that other side. There is always a chance to quit. You just have to want it. Some of us (like myself) have to be jolted to reality with an event as soul-altering as the one above. We are all stubborn as addicts, but we must believe the constant truth that we all can one day find shelter from the storm. 

Goodbye for now,

But then i thought about removing the naloxone off the Tilidin before I take them to get more of it than I shouldn’t keep it it all by myself 
I knew that if should  be that quite  difficult. If it wasn’t, we would know... 
so in started reading about both substances soluability

Aqua 25*celsius - 
only naloxone 3mg/ml Ethanol 
Tilidin is just considered „freely soluable in water, and ethanol. 

So of if one crushes the Pills as fine possibl and just put like 3-4?pills in warm water shot contain almost only the Tilidin naloxone mixture,right
So now, when i add some cold ethanol, the Tilidin solves instantly while you can colect parts of the naloxone from it to sort it out. 

The usual magical boundaries are at 350-400mg of Tilidin wich would come with up to 32 mg of  naloxone 

Removing even half of the Tilidin would be awesome, to try doses about 600-800mgs each

So, a little history. My gravitation around the Persian Poppy began around 8 years ago with Codeine. For 5 years I was happy with taking Codeine, up to 400mg/day. 

3 years ago I was able to acquire an Oxycodone script. Since then I have been quite happy with Oxycodone, up to 250mg/day.

In the last 3 months or so, I have found myself getting bored (Again lol) Oxycodone has stopped being something special and more routine.

So, I am now looking to move on to my next pharmaceutical opiate.

In the last 3 years, I have tried;

Codeine - have used this one to death

Tramadol - Not much fun really in comparison 

DHC - Have Oxy so no point really 

Morphine - Never really enjoyed this one in comparison to Oxy

Tapentadol - Not much experience 

Fentanyl - not much experience with this one either but from what I have read, this isn’t too recreational?

So, ones yet too try and would like some advice/interested in peeps experience;

Pethidine
Diamorphine
Diconal
OxyMorphone
HydroMorphone

Any others? 

The ones I am thinking will be of the most interest to me;

OxyMorphone
HydroMorphone.

Here’s my situation. I made a bad mistake when I decided to buy four doses after getting a little drunk. I was upset about work. The manager at work doesn’t like me and I had just started working. I work at a rental place and handle vehicles all day. It’s minimum wage but I’m just happy to be employed after years of unemployment and I fear losing my position. Anyway long story short I left work after getting yelled at. Got drunk  met the right guy and made a poor decision to get four doses. 2 days later I experienced some very minor withdrawal. Woke up get antsy raw and weirdly panicky. But I think it was all in my head because I didn’t get chills. I’ve also been using kratom about 5 days in a row I should add. This morning I go to work and skip my kratom. I realize I can’t go through this because I work double shift for 3 days in a row and need to be up on my game. Had I been home I would ride this out. I don’t know how close I am to physical addiction but it’s verry close. If I can just take heroin for 3 more days. Then I got a 4 day weekend. Do you think I can pull it off? Or is this just silly addict reasoning. I simply cannot go to work feeling like crap or i will be fired. I can’t use Kratom because it makes my face red/ sun burned looking and is a dead give away to my parents or worse. Manger will think I’m drinking.

Third time attempting to quit and hoping for the best this time.  

First:

\-Year \+ user, almost 2 years off & on; primarily snorting with occasional smoking

\- Alcoholic \(5\+ years\)

\- This last time, I tried to taper \(rather unsuccessfully\) and then when I quit fully I only made it a tad over a day before I caved

\- Been about two weeks since then, have now been tapering somewhat more effectively & I think I'm mentally more ready this time \(sez me every time I attempt to quit hahah\).  

\- I'm eyeing two weeks from now to do it.

SO.  I'm not going to bog it down with backstory or anything.   Just the questions I have:

1\) For those that are alcoholics:  I know I'm greatly effecting my comfort level and duration \(probably\) of the wds.  The other times I've tried quitting H, I kept my drinking to the minimum that also keeps those wds from flaring up \(about a pint of whiskey a day\).  Should I be attempting to not drink at all?  Taper that down more?  

2\) I've purchased a few of the supplements that folks on here say help.  L\-Tyrosine, DLPA, 5\-HTP, valerian root, melatonin, passion flower extract, & milk thistle.   Oh, and I'm trying to avoid kratom, but I'm not entirely against it.  Anything else I should get?  And also, I've already started taking these.  Is that pointless to do while I'm still on heroin?  I figured I need to build them up, but perhaps I'm doing damage or at best nothing at all?

3\) My good friend's girlfriend is also going to be quitting in the next few weeks.  She's been a longer term user & is currently mostly taking subs, but also shooting up once a week.  My friend thought it would be an interesting experiment if his girlfriend & I detoxed in the same house together to create a sort of competitive spirit to the whole thing?  Does that sound dumb as hell?  I'm actually quite competitive and so is she so he figured that might make it harder for us to relapse since neither of us would want to admit defeat.  I dunno.  Anyone try this?  But if not doing that, then I should certainly at least detox in a different setting than my home, yeah?  I think these last couple times doing it in my house, in my city, have carried an additional mental weight I wasn't accounting for.

Peace to all & thanks for any advice / comments that may come.",1528181470.0

I've not been around much lately, as the lady and I have been trying out this whole ""Real Life"" thing, but I was telling a story today and thought y'all would enjoy it.

Alright, so.  A few months back, my boss and I are getting ready to take off on a work trip.  Naturally, this requires meeting up with the dboy to stock up before we head out.  For reasons that I'm certain made sense at the time, he decided to bring this chick he was trying to fuck along, and told her we'd all throw in together. This girl and I had been a thing a while back, and it ended badly - girl was too much of a junkie for -me-.  I'm kind of annoyed, but arguing would put unneccessary steps between me and heroin, so I go along with it.  We pull up to the spot, wait on dude, and I go to meet him when he pulls up.  

When I get in dboy's car, I just hand him my money and hers separately, and ask him to just make 2 bags so I don't have to fuck with splitting it.  Despite this, when I give girl hers she says it's too small.  Shocking, I know.  After I tell her to go fuck herself, she tries to get both my boss AND the dude to tell me to break her more off - both of whom essentially tell her ""I'm not gonna do that, and also I can't imagine why you think it would work if I tried.""  About then her boyfriend pulls up and she goes off to whine to him about it.

This is where shit gets insane.  While she's gone, my boss tells me he'd count it as a favor if I'd let him pay me to give her another point.  Which is super sad, but alright,  I pull out my knife and have just sliced her extra bit off when she jerks the door open and tries to grab my whole sack.  I do my best to push her away with my head, since one hand has a knife in it and the other is busy defending my dope, but it turns out that you can't really gently headbutt someone, especially if you hit them in their super nasty abscessed tooth.  Girl FREAKS the fuck out and just starts pounding the shit out of me. She gets a couple good hits in, but I'm still surprised when I see blood hit the dashboard in front of my face.  Then I notice that there is a -lot- of blood flying around, and right around then I hear her start to scream.

You see, in her rush to beat my ass, girl had failed to notice the big-ass knife in my hand, and the dippy bitch had apparently cut the -shit- out of herself while delivering her beating.  She runs over to her boyfriend's car, who starts yelling about how he knows where I live and how he's gonna go there and shoot everyone he sees. I had moved out after my roommate tried to fight my 96 pound girlfriend, so I just told him that he was way too much of a bitch to show up there and start shit. Shockingly, he never does. 

Anyway, my boss takes me back to the place I was crashing, then runs off to see them in the ER while I try to get back to my room without my roommates noticing the epic bloodstains now on my hoodie.  A few minutes later, I get a text from him saying he explained to boyfriend what happened, and containing this photo of the single worst wound stitching job of all time.

---

When in active addiction everything seems feasible and like a good idea. In the peak of my shooting days, Dillon and Dan and I were all convinced we were gonna get out of this shit town for good. I believe vegas was the plan at one point. Why? Im not sure. If we left? we would lose all our connects to our beloved opana, but we were positive we could find that or heroin anywhere we went. We had the tattoos, marking us members of the secret junky club. I was only a few months deep but was real deep, which was represented well by the hundred scars patterned on top of my right arm and left wrist. ""Damn you got good veins. This will be easy. Wish I had veins like that."" That's what they would all say. Never thought I'd be complimented so well on my bulging veins. I wasn't always this skinny. I ran a lot and worked for it. Then later on dope worked me. I was a hollow ghost by the time my birthday rolled around. About 6 months deep into my IV oxymorphone binge and as always, my nice parents want to throw me a birthday party (even knowing what a huge junky i had become). 

My birthday was just like any other day. Every day is the same as a junky. We love the routine of it. That's part of the allure. It is stability in a sense, even if a warped chemical dependent, pseudo stable state. I had stay awake till 3 or 4am the night before with plenty of oxymorphone for myself for once. Usually I'd do it all with my using buddies that evening, but tonight was special. It was already technically my birthday. I notice the change on the clock as I sit alone in my room, with the door locked. I was sitting on the floor which was common for me then because I could easily hide the soda can with dope solution under the bed if anyone were to knock. However, my parents were sleeping soundly as always down the hall on the living room couch, dateline or something on the television for certain. The needle hidden directly in front of me, inside my houseshoe (what a great place for it...) was calling my name as I placed the toasted quarter pill, which was 10mg oxymorphone total. It could be less if any was destroyed by the heat of the toaster. (Wow, i really had the balls to toast a pill in my kitchen with my parents asleep in the next room). The solution looked like maple syrup and was similar in consistency too, as I mixed it around meticulously on top of the unopened Pepsi can. I'm not big on sugary soft drinks but for this use they were nice. 


I glance up for a moment to Twin Peaks on my television. That theme song may as well be my anthemn for banging opana. I still can't listen to it without thinking about it. I'm on season 2 but by the time I made it that far in the show, my addiction made it difficult to even watch something. It's so hard to absorb a show through sound only and mostly closed eyes. 


[I never reached a stale point either. As my tolerance increased, so did my dose. I always got high, but the rush died down so much. It got to the point I'd prefer cocaine in the mornings waking up just to feel a rush. I'd hunt it down while dopesick and forget about opana until afterward. When that coke wore off though... Wow. Talk about hell. Luckily we were printing money during these days so we would just pull over somewhere in Dillon's piece of shit Ford SUV somewhere to let him use my phone to fuck with his online accounts. I didn't question where he got the money from, and I couldn't say it if I even knew. I know sometimes we'd have to wait for him to call someone, proving he was who he said he was.]


None of this is going through my brain at the moment. I'm fixated on the syringe in front of me with the faded numbers, as I finish mixing the dope up with the plunger. I take my time, cutting off a cigarette cotton with my razor blade, wetting it and applying to the tip of my syringe, or just throwing it in the solution, either way. Then I'd slowly pull back because my needle was already worn as fuck, thus gave me great resistance. At last, 50 units were of this syrupy goodness where inside. Normally, I would've sucked up the rest just for a real shot (even then no real rush as it wasn't the first of the day). However, today was my birthday, but most of all it was the day of my family's party for me. 


No way I could go without saving a wake up...

After falling into a chemically induced slumber for the usual 10-12hrs (weird for a junky i know but tonight i was very well medicated). Despite that fact i wake im the afternoon of the next day. The day of my birthday. The day I'd lose so much. I wasnt quite sick and chronically constipated. This still didnt stop me from immediately grabbing my preloaded rig from inside of my finn and jake houseshoe right next to the bed. I had an hour or two before my party started and now was as good a time as any. I trudge my broken body into the bathroom, noting how the pretty and modern decor my mom furnished our home with didnt pop like usual. Everything was grey. I pull out the syringe from my pocket once the door is shut. My mom is preparing foodstuffs in the other room. ""Fuck!"" I think as i notice the bend in the tip. This would be a difficult one to register. 

I also cant help but notice the black solid particles floating around in the solution. That cant be good. Dan had once told me it was no good to save a shot for over a few hours once prepped. Made little sense to me but maybe. I think little of what is going through my veins and more about what is going through my brain without this substance in them. I go for my easy spot, right on the side of the left wrist. Very dangerous but easy. I poke it and feel a hard sting from the dull, bent metal tooth. I was crucifying myself with a coffin nail. I see red finally after wiggling and poking it in and out a bit. I push down and... ahh. Relief again.

I walk out all glossy eyed and floating on my cloud.  Or not actually. The shot was a tease. My rush didnt truly hit. My asshole other self, the junky me, had taken most of the shot for his needs last night. I hsd forgotten totally until i walked out the door and still didnt feel the rush. It is usually  very pregalent like the warmest headband you have ever worn. 

Time passes quickly however as grandparents begin to show up at our home early for the 3pm party. Of course i had just woken up, done a shot in the room right next to em, and then still hugged and thanked them with scarred arms. I felt invincible and wore short sleeves. My family would never accuse me of something so vile as injecting pills like i do. I did it though. It was my lifeline. It was my love and all i thought about.

 Id meditate on my bed in the classic Buddhaesque style. I'd go for 20 minutes, twice a day sometimes but usually slacked and did one. I would always do this after getting well of course. No time to sit around doing nothing without opiates lining my brain with goodness and contentment. (Even considering the quote: ""one should sit in meditation one hour every day. Unless you're busy.  Then sit two.""

Then something i had not considered yet happened: my old friends showed up. Now i had only been absent from their lives for the last few months but it felt like an eternity to me. I was so selfish i forgot about them honestly. Dope made me into a piece of shit or maybe vice versa. 



We sit around my kitchen table eating cake and chik-fil-a chicken from a party platter. My mom really goes all out to make me happy even though she can't. Almost made me feel bad considering we are right where i had toasted some endo opana for my veins the night previous. We catch up and reminisce on old times, while i stare blankly at the wall, looking right past them and thinking of texting Dillon. I know I'm texting him already. They know it is my bday so i will have some cash. I glance down under the table at my phone. I open my textnow app used for burner shit and see my messages are blowing up already. Dan: ""wake ur ass up man it's time"".  Dillon: ""yo man wake up we need to use ur phone"" (except imagine way more retarded spelling) i reply to let them know itll be soon. Im faking smiles and attention to my real friends directly in front of me at the table  eating my cake that i cant even enjoy because im not fucking high yet. 

Okay thats it. Lets get this ordeal over with. We've had enough fun. Granted at this point my party had been going on a whole 30-45 minutes. I was so ready to leave 30 minutes ago. My pseudo-rush held me for 15 maybe. I needed some cocaine too. 

So i mention some bullshit story to my mom about needing to go to my friends across town who she knows as my weed dealer. I figure at this point i cant hide it so may as well toss the blame elsewhere to throw her off. Yeah i was shitty. This actually led to problems eventually but that's another story entirely. She takes the hint and i begin with the opening of the money, i mean cards. 80$ score in total. The least I'd ever gotten from my whole, generous family members. They all knew where it was going. Don't ask me why they even gave that much. My mom especially can never give up on me though and sometimes enables me but ah well.

 Love is a confusing thing which makes us do less than rational things. Right now i was in love with the rush of cocaine and oxymorphone. It was due to this same rush  that i hurried to say my thanks and goodbyes, and that i need to ""go on a bike ride for exercise"". I rolled off to scorned and confused looks from mom, dad, grandparents, aunts, uncles and most of all my good friends (well they werent great in all honestly but i was worse). I rolled away from my own party within an hour, and from about 3 or 4 good friendships and all broken family ties which still haven't been repaired.

And cue the weird dreams / nightmares. 
For example, last night, I just kept having dreams about using (heroin) and hiding my use from people. I slept like shit and kept waking up, feeling stressed as fuck. 

I want to buy this dope. And smoke it or snort it, and it would last forever because my tolerance is low as balls, and it would itch that scratch that's been around for years. But obviously I don't want it bad enough that I've already done it, or i would have. 

I'm reluctant to go back but it's waiting for me whenever I want it. 

Apparently shits stressing out my subconscious though. I've been having dreams like these the past week. 

I don't know if I'll buy the tar or if I'll just keep taking pills. Just uncertain about what's to come. Thanks for reading this far.

I think I am done abusing opiates.,"I started seeing a pain management doctor in October of 2016. I have a deformed vertebrae that has caused a lot of intense lower back pain, bulging discs in my neck from being rear-ended a few years ago, and chronic kidney stones. I walked out of my first appointment with a script for percocet that changed my life. Suddenly I was able to get about eight hours a day pain free, and that drastically improved my quality of life! I was happy, carefree, my anxiety was lowered, and life felt good. Coupled with epidural injections, trigger point injections, lidocaine patches, and special compound cream, my pain was managed and for the first time since I was about 15 I felt *good*. 

The first few months were easy. I would have to ration the last few days of pills, but in general did okay staying on my prescribed schedule. Unfortunately, last summer I found out my husband was cheating on me, left him, and quickly slid into a dark place. I didn't work for a few months. I started redosing more often, just trying to escape from my misery and feel a little warmth. My scripts were only lasting half the month. I started looking in to alternate sources for meds, and started supplementing my script with any tramadol, codeine, or DHC I could get my hands on. This worked well enough.

Then around the new year, the scripts started lasting ten days... so I went to the onions to score some more of my DoC, oxy. My dose never ballooned too high-- I don't think I ever took more than 30-40mg of oxy a day, which I know most people here would consider relatively low. I've seen two of my siblings battle with IV heroin addiction and I know how much harder it could be.

I ran out of my May script in 8 days. I knew this would be a miserable, miserable experience, so I decided to order a single Sub strip and use that to get off. I was able to cut the 8mg strip into increasingly smaller slivers and had a very comfortable nine days tapering down from that. I took my last dose at 7am yesterday morning. I know it has a long half life, but I'm pretty achey today. Luckily, I had today off (and planned this so I'd be off today in case things were really bad). I have benzos for anxiety, but never found myself abusing them. I'm going to be really mindful about how I take them over the next few weeks to make sure I'm not swapping one thing for another. I'm also prescribed a low dose of adderall for treatment-resistant depression, but again, haven't ever desired to take a higher dose. 

I'm due for a refill of ""the good stuff"" next week and I'm not going to ask my doc for it. I wish I could trust myself to keep it around and use it ""as needed"", but I know myself and I'm not at that point (and not sure I ever will be). I kept my prescription on the DL from friends and family (because of my siblings' larger-scale issues with opiates, I didn't want them to worry) and don't have anyone I could trust to hold them for me for times of legitimate need. 

I'm hoping, hoping with all my heart this ends my time abusing opiates. Opiates saw me through tons of pain, an unhappy marriage and divorce, two rounds of sepsis, and a lot of heartache. But I don't want this to be my life anymore. I'm young (mid-twenties). I have a decent job and it's looking like I'll be promoted to manager within the next few months. I'm sick of my bank account being under $20. I want to get my own place, a car made in this century, and maybe put a dent in my student loans?? I want to be able to buy my pets as many treats and toys as they deserve after seeing me through all this pain and loving me unconditionally. 

I was never an active poster here, but I came here a lot to read what other people have been through and I'm grateful for you lovely souls. I'm not sure I could do this without reading the testaments from people who have successfully made it off. Thanks.",1528146611.0

Hoping to get some feedback on my latest idea as well. 

I'd love to be able to simply swallow what I have but I would rather not put my life in danger by swallowing \~1.5\+ grams of heroin that could reasonably be adulterated with fentanyl etc.

Recently I've requested that my dealer not put it in a bag, which always works fine since it's rocked up, and my plan in case I were to be pulled over would be to discard the rock\(s\) in a soda cup and allow them to dissolve. That way I could allow the officer to search my car, and I doubt anyone would look to a McDonald's cup for drugs. Am I correct in assuming that or is that more common than I think? I read in another thread from a few months ago about someone who was caught after discarding that way, and they were charged for the weight of the water bottle. I replied asking for more information and I'm hoping to hear back about how the event went down. 

A funny and probably good suggestion I also read was to have a bag or container of some sort with sex toys in it, and to hide it in there. The idea being that the officer likely wouldn't want to go through another person's sex toys as that usually embarrasses people.",1528145483.0

I went through a period of about 1.5 years where I primarily used heroin due to sources of pharmaceuticals being cut off. During that time, I only snorted it, and while I got extremely strong effects, none of them could be considered positive. I got a heavy nod, a feeling of dysphoria \(basically the opposite of euphoria\), sometimes nausea and really very little else. I usually felt like complete shit when I would use it. My opioid of choice before that was oxycodone, which is just the best feeling ever, IMO. I remember oxycodone making me feel excited but relaxed, and full of this amazing energy.

Recently researchers and doctors have been sounding the issue, and a woefully significant majority of medical professionals ignore or are not even aware of this retrovirus. Blood banks are required to screen for it, but harm reduction literature and guidelines rarely include it in their information to patients and doctors. 

It is important to raise awareness of it and push for widely available testing and knowledge of this virus. In the next few decades medical research will focus more on viruses because we are finding they are associated with a large number of cancers and chronic illnesses. 

It is an interesting area of research for me, and the first thing that I recognized about this particular retrovirus is how inadequately equipped and prepared humanity is for dealing with it. There are a number of reasons due to virology pathology as well as social and political historical reasons it is under recognized, but the important thing is to get people aware so we can start working on more effective treatments. It was the push for awareness with HIV and the devastating effects it had in a relatively short time which led to treatment developments. Because the time between infection and severe illness with HTLV is so long, and because its discovery was overshadowed a short time later with the discovery of HIV, treatment and drug developments have lagged behind where they could and should be.


Really, we could see effective immunizations against most retroviruses become available in our lifetimes, and effective cures available for those already infected. There is exciting research into genetic resistance of these illnesses, and how to transfer them into other humans via gene therapy. My small organization is taking research done by other medical startups and expanding on it, I hope this message serves as a small introduction to these issues and helps you in some way in achieving healthy outcomes in your life regardless of personal lifestyle choices.

I still have a fair amount of dope but I take it rectally (eww, I know) and can't take all my gear overseas.

I'm also a benzo addict which sucks because I'm going to have to bring enough pills to keep the benzo WD at bay. (On that note, any advice on taking benzos overseas? I'm planning to put them in a vitamin container in my hold luggage).

I'd considered rapidly tapering my H usage this week before I go (e.g. start at 150mg which gets me well and drop by 50/25 mg a day), but I dismissed that idea because I have no experience tapering H and I figured I may as well get the worst of the withdrawals out of the way this week so I can attempt to enjoy my vacation.

The third time was the charm.  The alluring succulent charm of heavy opioids. wake up, eat a protein bar on the move, and hit the road. I was only halfway between my transition from snorting chipper (once or twice a week) to IV junky. Mentally however i was fully converted. Thats the reality of it. Youre mentally hooked from day one. However it usually takes yers to get physically addicted. Well this was my year. 

Somedays i just walked. I would tell mom i was going to my neighbors, a video gamer friend of mine. She is on good terms with him so usually seemed to believe me. In the back of my head remained the anxiety, ""what if she texts him, or goes to town and passes me?"" I was way too focused for this. I was loyal to that spike already, so I  grabbed mine out from under a little bundle of twigs, just obscured from the view of my front porch by the three sky scraping pines poking towards the heavens. The same pine trees I used to climb up in with buddies when we were young are now used to give me the privacy to continue my degeneracy unnoticed.

I tuck the rig in between my waistband and pubis area. God, do i hope that cap doesnt come off... not that it would matter. I hadn't seen any action in that area since the first time I shot oxymorphone.  My romance had shifted from human attraction to chemical and the masochistic degradation of my own body. Oh it's a used needle? No problem.. Ill just bleach it. No bleach? No worries, you dont catch hiv/hepatitis from just sharing once right? (I google the results and find the percentage is less than 1% chance of contracted HIV from a dirty pin prick). 

By the time i was almost ready to begin hitting myself i was routinely offered to ""shoot some cocaine maaan"" by Dillon's dumbass, the usual term Dan referred to him as, fittingly. He came to me immediately asking to use my phone for his ebay account, and if i let him he will give me a shot of coke. I nervously agree as we walk behind the drug den. I wave tl Roxanna on the front porch. ""Hi sweetie!"", she says heartwarmingly. Well she must be high. I briefly feel relieved knowing i dont have my mom's 250$ bike with me today, to leave in the yard of a junky candyland.

I hand Dillon my iPhone reluctantly once we're inside the screen doors which lead to the laundry room aka shooting gallery of this little old lady's home she shares with about 5-10 junkies at any given time. I still dont quite understand it all but only a couple were related to her. Dillon commands Dan to prep the coke shot. ""Give em 10 units maaan. That's all he needs"" alright sure even though it didnt sound like much. Little did i know...

Dan professionally preps the shot, pouring out the rocks onto a soda cans bottom, drawing up 30 or 40 units and squirting it on the coke, on the bottom of a coke can. It was at this point i pull out my rig. ""Man is that the same one you been using"", asks Dan.""yeah man..."" 

""Okay this stuff is too good to miss and it's dangerous too. We need to grt you a fresh rig. I'll bleach mine for you"" Sounds intriguingly like q terrible idea but i care not. I'm a regular IV user of pills which are made of rubber or concrete im really not sure which (endo opana). Bring on the danger. Coke in a dirty used rig couldn't be much worse right? Well surprisingly enough it was in the case of missed shots. I glance down at Dan's leathery tan hands and notice the band-aid on his wrist. 

""Oh you wanna know how i get that huh?"" He notices my gaze set on his wrist. Before i answer he continues, ""shootin fuckin cocaine... I'm getting too old for this shit now. Now when i was younger i could go go go but nowadays i cant hardly handle the damn comedown."" He rips off the band-aid and i see this awful boil looking thing i come to know good and well later as an abscess. It's an infected area from missed shots and his was from cocaine which is brutal as fuck. I mean it numbs your teeth.

So it surely numbs your whole damn arm if you miss. It was fine. I trusted Dan's years of degenerate pseudo doctor experience and my trusty young and plump... veins


""Oh that comedown shit sucks huh? I know it always did when i sniffed this stuff a couple years back."" I say trying to switch gears from imagining a potential abscess in my future. I also now see he has the needle ready and filled with 30 units of cocaine solution. ""Get that bleach there and pour a cap full and meet me out back in the pool room. You will wanna be outside and in fresh air for this.. you're gonna puke. All of us do our first time"". 

I somehow thought nothing of it and just followed his instructions and went out the sliding screen and glass doors, walked a few steps towards an old worn down, open faced shed type deal with a pool table and many empty soda cans, used needles and ashtrays. Poison ivy was the outer decor and broken windows painted the inside with a bleak picture. Just the spot to shoot up some powerful stimulant drugs. 

I finish rinsing my rig for the millionth time with water to remove all the bleach after i draw up a bit in it. Dont wanna risk shooting bleach so i ask the pros what they think (Dillon has already shot his and thrown up as per tradition. He was waiting outside excitedly ready to see me shoot it.)

""Nah you're good man. That's plenty"", says Dillon. Dan nods in agreement. That's good enough for me too then. I was shaky and nervous and sweaty from withdrawals already kicking in. No point doing my opana shot first though.  Ill *need* it to come down.  I was too excited myself to worry about my symptoms too much. ""Dont worry"", says Dan with confidence, ""the coke kills the sickness for a few minutes and we will get your other shot ready so you dont come down at all."" 

They always wqnted to prep it. Thinking back i was probably less addicted from Dan masterfully sneaking the thicker part of the goop and re adding water. Weve all witnessed him doing it but said little. We were too dependent on all his connections.  I was dependent on his nurse skills. He registered in my vein just as quickly as i could say I'm ready and there spurts the red mistress, ""oh im coming"", she whispers in my ear. I know it is time. Dan presses down the plunger and immediately i hear sounds become sharper. Vision becomes intensely vivid.  I gotta walk! I gotta get on my bike! I exhale sharply and smile.  Dillon's yellow crooked teeth stare at me taunting me with how much he is enjoying this. I fast walk past him and smell vomit. It doesnt affect me now. Im content just pacing circles in this uncut yard. My mind is working at optimum capacity. All my hustles line up. ""Okay gotta ebay this and that! Work this odd job, maybe still this or flip that."" I already knew i needed more of this experience but i didnt know i would need it daily. 

My endorphins were firing off so fast it felt like my brain was being caressed by a goddess. Serenaded by Billie Holiday. I had the felt the white girl's kiss and it felt oh so good. ""Dude are you gonna puke?"", asks Dillon. ""Nah dude, i feel better than ever."" As soon as i spoke i felt the hint of a comedown already. I glance at my phone. Five minutes have passed. What have i been doing?

 That was every coke rush. It made me so energetic yet so paradoxically blissfully relaxed. I breifly consider the possibility i am a ADD case but then i realize it is probably just the rush itself than is calming me down. It is kinda how i imagine a pure adrenaline shot would feel or close to it. Maybe more euphoric. Maybe less. Im not sure. All i know was that it is the craziest feeling i have ever felt. I had to have more yet there was no more. Not yet. There was more work to be done first.  I'm coming down hard now and glance at the already prepped oxymorphone solution. I salivate. Bliss awaits.",1528079265.0

---


A couple months of snorting this and popping that went by until I ran into Dan again. I had been to the drug house many times in between but only the front rooms with my buddy Mark (the original connect i had here for weed and hydros). He lives here with his girlfriend, and they sling out of their bedroom. A shitty, smoke-stained room right to the left of entering the house. I would stand restlessly upon the concrete floor with my flip flops (how i never lost a toe from biking in them so much while high, I'll never know).  Now Mark's weed was always shitty Mexican bricks, but he knew the people i needed to go through to get pills too. He found everything from oxys to valiums to gabapentin to shitty flexeril I scoffed at. When will people realize not all downers are fun or euphoric? 

However, I'll give the kid a break. He's just a young pothead who hangs out with the wrong crowd. He grew up in the projects with parents who weren't really there. Such a sadly typical story, huh? I remember he always like me ever since i used to visit the projects in a Xanax-induced haze to pick up, you guessed it: more Xanax or roxys/opana if i were out or lucky enough to find more. After making our transaction, Mark's neighbor and I would smoke a slobbery joint (he always did this. Young stoners..) with him right next door afterwards. Anyways to keep a long story short this is how I met Mark. A year or so later I met Dan through him. 

---

Now, moving forward to the night in April or June or whenever it was when I tried IV opana for the second time.  A nice writer I saw recently mentioned how severe addiction is analogous to traveling through different dimensions. Honestly that is how that six month period of my life feels. I thought it was only due to a drug induced haze, but could it be something more, something visceral? Like our souls being raped. 

**Beginning of summer, the day I became a junky:**

It was a day just like any other. I can't lie and say i even remember it in particular. I mean it was my second time, not the first. I can remember some of what was going through my addicted, expertly rationalizing brain.  ""Oh I went months in between it last time. Same thing this time!"" I was so certain I could chip with IV use. I mean people online do it all the time! Why have I been wasting 50-75% of all the drugs I've ever consumed over my long, and chaotic, yet slightly romantic descent into oblivion. 

I grab the plush mountain bike my mom had bought for ""us"", and tell her that I'm going for a little ride. She takes another long pull on her menthol cigarette. She says, ""okay baby. Be careful"" and continues rocking in her chair on the porch where she spends many hours (well if she even has time). Off I glide, out the blacktop driveway and up the hill past the curb, just out of sight from my mom. I pull my phone out now and call Mark's (aka the house phone at the drug den). Dan answers. This was unexpected. ""Hey uhh... is Mark there?"", I ask hesitantly. 

""Yeah sure. Hold on..""

 ""No, wait.. I actually needed to ask you if you could help me try the same thing as last time"" 

""Yeah, you still got your rig?"" 

I didn't, but he assured me it would be okay to find another one. I hang up the phone as I roll on past the car wash where I normally meet plugs. I'm already shaking from nerves and excitement. I am gonna feel that rush again! I had not forgotten it for even a second even if I told myself at the time I didn't care. It didn't occur to me that I was in fact already obsessed. I pedal at a frantic pace that even the hobos gave me strange looks for. My thighs burned as I passed the assisted living towers in midtown and began the uphill climb up some shoddy concrete walkway. I used to skate down this sidewalk for fun, now I'm biking up it for drugs. 

I think briefly about the good old days but am quickly interuppted by the sight of Dan and Mark's car (well old lady's car they borrow) pulling out of the backroad. I see arms flailing out the side motioning me to get in. 

They explain it is now or never on the opana situation. Mark jumps out and helps me stuff my bike in the backseat. I hop in the middle, riding bitch seat as we make our way back the direction I just came from.  ""Lenny falls asleep at 5P.M. sometimes so we have to hurry"", explains Dan. Looking back there was always a hurry if he was not well. That's another thing I liked him for. He never bullshitted around time wise. Most of his guys didn't either. 

As we cruise through town in a busted up old Honda we discuss drugs and women and money. Dan said something which always stuck with me. Something about men only needing two things: dope and a woman. Then he said with enough dope we don't even need her. At this point I wasn't enough of a junky (and foreveralone) to agree, but I saw his point. He had been divorced from his wife and separated from his kids so long the oxymorphone was the only warmth he ever felt now. 

Now, we're almost to our destination as we turn left before the car wash by my house. Next we turn up a steep hill going back into woods a little bit. I had never been up this road. It's a dead end with a couple secluded homes at the end. An optimum spot for a drug dealer. No one could see all your traffic from the main road. So the first time I visited Lenny's I wasn't supposed to go inside. I slide Dan my 25$ giving him my complete trust in this moment. My wellness relies upon him. I knew he wouldn't fuck me over because he was smart. He knew getting in good with me meant more dope for him. I wait in the front seat with Mark but he gets out too. He is bullshitting with some guy on the porch but I'm still instructed not to get out.

After a few restless minutes Dan returns with a tiny chunk of a yellow e series opana pill. ""You're going back to our place to do this right?"", asks Dan pointlessly. He already knew my answer was yes since theres no way I'm snorting this pill and can't shoot on my own yet with no supplies. We drive carefully back home on backroads as we discuss my latest money making scheme of selling Pokemon cards online. They were appalled i made so much this way. Up until now I had only sold the duplicates. Boy would that change fast. I noticed right away Dan's seriousness about being careful. He had never been arrested or even close to being in trouble. I could see why. He is a silver-tongued devil and very paranoid. He always hated driving with needles. Shit, who doesn't? It becomes like second nature in time though. I always had that thing tucked around my waistline like a second cock. (Well, at least it was useful!)

I think how tortuous this conversation is becoming just because I'm so sick and anxious. ""My nerves are killing me"", I blurt out. Dan assures me not to worry. He says all my worries and fears are about to be a thing of the past. Hell, he's right.  He just forgot to mention I would be taking on a whole new level of worry: literal obsession with pushing chemical solution through my veins, which got to the point where my entire human structure was molded to suit this need. The term autopilot applies here.  I felt this word pop up so often in the back of my mind, up until the junky (on junky steroids now) jumped up and blocked it like the NBA star he was. 

Finally we are pulling in the short, yet packed gravel driveway in front of our little filth den. We jump out quickly as possible. I realize Dan still has the pill but i am not worried.  Mark and Dan go in the front. They tell me to go in back. My heart then drops for a second in that emotionally fragile withdrawal state. I still hold strong. I creep to the back door and see Dan begin to slide it open for me. The toaster is already warming. The pill coating is being wiped off. Dan reaches for his marked rig in the collection of used rigs. He grabs a fresh bag and hands me a new one. Now he begins to teach me as he pulls the marshmallow roasted yellow pill chunk out of the toaster. He hands me a cup of warm water and says to draw up 100 units. He has me squirt it on the hot pill and i hear a sizzle signify the endorphins already beginning to fire off in my brain. He shows me how to flip the rig over and mix with the bottom part of the plunger. ""See how it sticks to it? We dont want that. That's dope."" I realize that much, but I still smile like a madman and nod in agreement. I keep smashing this goopy, solid pill matter until it is all a syrup. It looks and has the consistency of maple syrup but with a raw burnt chemical smell I can't quite recall or forget. 

He takes an already prepared cotton, pre-wetted, and places it on the end of my needle. ""Now draw it up"", he says sure of me. I shakily do so as I see the goopy liquid syrup slowly leak into the syringe barrel. Even with a new rig it takes a while to suck up a fluid of this consistency. Now strangely for the first time I realize how wrong this whole process is and how these are not meant to be abused especially in this way. This thought is so transient as the barrel fills and my veins start to come out from hiding. Actually they usually were popping out albeit wet from sweat often (riding my bike so hard does this). I worried about infection briefly. I wipe my arms with an alcohol pad or my shirt. Not sure which it was that day. 

Danny looks at me sternly and holds out his hand. I hand him the syringe and hold out my arm. ""Don't i need a belt?"" 

""Nah i can hit you. You got good veins."" 

I once again gave this fifty year old junky, (once an average and morally good man) my full trust as I stare intently at the shot of dope in his leathery, tan hands. All the years of running around and working in the sun for a pill had made his skin this way. I could read his character from the tracks and abscess scars on his wrists and hand. He goes directly to my biggest puffy vein on top of my right arm. It is just asking to be punctured and violated. I shake a bit as he insists I be still so he doesn't hurt me by missing. ""It kills me to miss on someone else, so be still."" I can't relate to that guilt.

Finally, I feel the poke of the fresh needle's tip. So subtlety sweet, like the color of the blood that followed, which plumed into the barrel of dark brown oxymorphone solution. My death wish had been certified, as I close my eyes in orgasmic pleasure the instant he pushes down that plunger. 

Mother morphine wraps a perfectly warm blanket around my neck and torso, she tickles my toes with pleasure and assures me everything is alright again, if even for a moment. The rush becomes more intense as she leans closer, whispering one word in my ear: ""relief"".",1528076141.0

Jim and Jan are friends whom I used to \(and still do\) hang out with every week, maybe a couple of times a week to bullshit around on my computer, maybe learn to code with my friend who did such for a living and smoke blunts. Eventually I was getting into snorting roxies and dope with Clifford and some days I'd leave before too late to meet Cliff or would hang with Cliff instead of hanging out with Jim and Jan. No big deal, this couple who are my friends aren't dicks, they don't give me hell for not being around and if they do they do so for kicks. Surely a bit out of some genuine concern. Jim doesn't like many people so it's high praise if he's wondering to his wife ""where the heck has Sloan been?""

&nbsp;

Well, eventually I was doing dope and pills more frequently. Some of my [early Cliff posts ](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/67l68l/another_post_about_the_waiting_game/?ref=share&ref_source=link)were generated by the situations I got myself into back then. Things like ""Cliff owes me three bags, I'm sick and still waiting."" Such posts often consisted of a blow\-by\-blow breakdown and under a different user name than this one although both separated from my real life associated net aliases. Anyway, it was bullshit. In a question to Cliff I'd ask,[ ""did you see Zaino yet?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/67l68l/another_post_about_the_waiting_game/?ref=share&ref_source=link) It's fun to reflect now that I've made strides in preventing and outright avoiding such scenarios.

&nbsp;

So I'd ask and get such great hits as:

&nbsp;

\- ""It's going down now."" \-Cliff

Over the course of four hours it would become evident nothing was going down. I had my ear tuned to the sound of the middleman's ice cream truck so when I heard it I'd check out the window, notify Cliff and wait for good news. All that only to find out the ice cream man only offered crack and had no dope. In retrospect, maybe the ice cream man really owed Cliff dope and delivered it. If it was a small amount, there's no doubt Cliff would opt to stick it up his nose and not share. These days I am on direct communication terms with Derrick the creamer man and although I would never let myself get into the aforementioned situation again, if I did I would get answers from a less untrustworthy source.

&nbsp;

\- ""Zano just got out of the shower."" \-Cliff

I guess he gave this detail to indicate that the dboy wasn't enroute yet, but would be getting ready to deliver shortly. Of course for a stalling bullshitter, any number of excuses can be made to explain further delays. ""He gotta pick up from the guy, then make a stop, then come here."" Something like that.. it varied. See lost Cliff posts for details.

&nbsp;

\- Other assorted scenarios where Cliff owed me 2\-5 bags of dope repeated throughout the month that I was missing from Jim and Jan's life. A bag being equal to 1/10 of a bundle, 3 bags isn't really significant but nonetheless it is an amount that I was owed and promised by a set time. 

&nbsp;

\-On an early occasion, like after the first Cliff post I was asked to loan him three bags of dope and in exchange for five bags the following day. Interest \-\- that interests me! So sure, I did it only to wait and encounter delays. Often waiting until script day for Cliff to pay me back. I think that was the weekend I spent re\-watching all of Gundam SEED. 

&nbsp;

In the last two bullet points, those insignificant amounts of dope couldn't do much. Maybe could help with a little rationing and maybe could help as part of a taper plan to reduce the intensity of withdrawal. However, doing without such small amounts two days into the withdrawal at least allowed me to be further along in the process. Consuming a couple of bags of dope two days into a three day weekend before a work day would likely reset the withdrawal cycle.

&nbsp;

Eventually rationality won out, I knew there was no way to have enough dope to never be in withdrawal, so if I was to continue using, it only made sense to prioritize getting Suboxone. Cliff appeared to be cooperative but things always went wrong. It was a jynx when he said ""we should never have to go through withdrawal again."" This was said when referring to our existing and new connect for the stuff but both had their deficiencies. One of them drove and sometimes didn't have them upon arrival. The second guy was hit or miss and almost every time I got subs from that guy I was splitting them with Cliff so they only lasted half as long.

&nbsp;

Fast forward a bunch of months, the end of 2017 draws near and Cliff had me buttered up to get $200 in subs at a grand discount. It seemed good and true although I had no evidence. No evidence of his ""friend who gets a script but doesn't use them anymore."" When I finally dropped the $200, just about the last of that pay check I am informed that his ""friend"" has a ""brother who still uses dope."" As a result, Cliff had to buy dope to give to the guy with the subs in exchange for subs. The guy with the subs would then give the dope to his brother. Of course as I waited for the subs to get delivered Cliff stated he fucked up and explained that the guy's brother came by in the morning, picked up the dope and the guy with the Subs stopped answering his phone right after that.

&nbsp;

The night before when I handed over the money I thought I was doing my due diligence asking a series of questions in hopes of ensuring nothing would go wrong. Cliff said that I was stressing him out, ""you're doing that thing you do where you ask the same questions over and over."" I wonder why I would form that habit.... In any case it's obvious I was right to be so inqusitive but stupid and wrong to follow through with my end of the bargain.

&nbsp;

After that I started covering my ass more hardcore. Right before thanksgiving Cliff was talking about getting a brick of dope and I knew he was just trying to butter me up to get on board with committing funds. I said outright, ""I'm not looking to spend my paycheck to get a brick of dope."" To which he said, ""I'm not saying that you are."" Then he went on to say how he was going to get it with or without me and how important it is to not be sick through the Thanksgiving holiday. ""If you don't get dope, I know I'll just end up giving you dope as you need it."" Saying this to build a case for my voluntary investment, because if I didn't have my own Suboxone connect and plans in place he would've been my only option when the sickness started setting in.

&nbsp;

Come Thanksgiving and Black Friday Cliff did not buy bricks of dope. He was couped up in his bed relegated to urinating in Gatorade bottle to avoid walking to the bathroom and incurring his mother's wrath. Why was he broke and without dope if he was indicating just a week earlier that he would have money for dope? Obviously \(I think\), if I went along with the plan he presented the week prior I would've been screwed out of a bunch of money and only gotten half the dope I paid for. From there, I would've likely been sick for Thanksgiving and Black Friday. For work days in which I would be standing for over 12 hours, it's a very cruel setup. Maybe that wasn't Cliff's intention but it certainty wasn't a priority for him to prevent me from going through that experience if I was stupid enough to help him.

&nbsp;

To be continued. For now let us rejoice in the knowledge that we all have the power to ensure we are not dope sick. Let's also rejoice that too many other people don't have a ""Cliff"" in their life. For those who do, just remember that you are the captain of your own destiny. With the yank of the ships telegraph you can tell your engine room to steam forward as you steer a course of your choosing and none other.

&nbsp;

Oh, and yes, I do appreciate my friend Jim and Jan. I just hated traveling to their house dope\-sick although I did at one point learn that on day three or for of dope\-sickness that bicycling and smoking blunts helped tremendously.",1528067997.0

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8odhxt/how_i_became_an_iv_junky_part_2

---

When i was young i was fascinated with sticking my finger in light sockets. My mom used to tell me ""baby go zoot zoot"" in her creative attempt to deter me. Still, i would keep on shocking myself. Doing things i wasn't supposed to felt good if only because it was forbidden. When they told me to never try drugs, same thing. I think i will tell my kids drugs are not the problem. It is doing them daily which is the problem.

By high school i already knew i would become a drug addict. This was before i had ever even seen a maryjewana cigarette. My perceptive friend would always say, ""dude you sound so stoned"". ""You listen to Pink Floyd and The Doors, you gotta be a pothead!"" Well i was sober, but not by choice. I was so antisocial that i never had access. One day i found out the local skate crowd might know where to acquire some of the herbal remedies making up all my daydreams as of late, dozing off to Dark Side of the Moon. I imagined the feeling to be like the orgasmic tonal qualities of the female vocalist in Great Gig in the Sky. 

I wish i could tell you with certainty that it all began that day. Of course i dont believe that. I lean more towards the destiny theory, or wanted to. It was completely inevitable i end up with an insulin syringe full of oxymorphone sticking out the crook of my arm, held in the sturdy hands of my 50 year old pseduo-doctor junky friend who stayed part time in this drug den. on paper it was registered to the sweet old lady taking us in. I'm not exactly sure what made me make the jump to IV use. Okay, maybe it was peer pressure. Maybe it was... you guessed it: destiny. 

How i was led to this situation is a typical story. I was bored and lonely and just generally jaded with life. Depression since high school had caused everything to take on quite a grey, cold quality (kinda like the atmosphere of a fent buzz). All the weed i smoked helped while it lasted. All this smoking led me to meet many strange characters. One day a weed dealer of mine has this 50 year old guy with him in the car. He says ""hey man if u can get any needles i can hook you up. We have hydros."" Now i had used opiates here and there, but i had never been friends with an IV user. This immediately sparked my interest. In the back of my mind i thought ""this is my chance"".

A few more weeks go by of me simply buying hydros and then eventually opana. I would walk the few miles across town to get to my special little drug den. So many different characters lived there: Roxanne, the sweet but sometimes sour (when on benzos she was a bitch) girl who used to tell me im beautiful. I wish i could say the same for her but seeing a woman crying, hanging upside down from a dryer, trying to register in her last good vein in her foot and failing is not flattering. She was literally a bloody mess. Then you have Red, the hyper junky with obvious disease eating away at his liver. He only shot with gigantic needles. I forget what theyre called. Then Bob, son of our town's huge dealer. Last but not least, Dan and Dillon who would become my using buddies for the next sixth months. 

Dan was a wise 50 year old normal ass dude who got divorced for good after years of slowly falling deeper into addiction. I could tell his wife and kids not wanting him in there lives was the main drive behind his search of a chemical hiding place. He taught me more about the dope game than anyone i know. I loved chilling with him, mostly because i had faith in him to *always* find something for us. He knew everyone. One number fails, onto the next. If that failed we go driving until we find it. 

Now Dillon was probably one of the dumbest kids I've known. He could read but beyond that not much i could say about him. With that said it makes me feel even dumber for letting him be the one to peer pressure me into that shot on that fine, warm day in June. 

It was a normal day like any other, but my life would honestly never be the same after. Well my brain never functioned the same. I walked the normal walk across my small mountain town, felt in my pockets for my 25$ as i turned left up a backroad past the bank. I always recall the dog in the first house on the road barking like rabies where leaking out his ears. Almost like he knew how bad i was about to fuck up. 

I reached ole granny's drug den, going in the front for now because i wasnt labeled as a junky yet in her eyes. I passed Roxanne and a couple other randoms who were resting on the couch. ""Hey sweetie"", she always greeted me in a manner which caused a few butterflies to float up my chest. She was a very attractive woman despite all her self abuse, in her dark sunglasses and tight blue jeans. Her eyes had seen as much pain as any miserable person ever had, if they were open. 

I said my hellos and was ignored by the Granny as usual. She knows why I'm here. I make my way back through the kitchen to the backroom, where i see a gnarly site of two dudes sticking themselves like pin cushions. ""Uhh hey yall got opana?"" I hated trying to snort these endo series ones, but that is all they had. I bought a quarter of a 40mg pill for about  25$ (ridiculous). It was then as i tried to leave dillon comes up to me excited. ""Hey man you gotta try it this way! It is so much better! The rush is unlike anything you have seen"". I told him i didn't know how. ""Danny is good at this man, he can hit ya!"" 

Now danny wasnt ignorant. He at least acted like he wanted to talk me out of it even if deep down he knew he wanted me right in the gutter with em. Why not? Free drugs for them for finding them for me. This was always my deal. Sharing never bothered me. I have empathy for my fellow addict. He finally saw it in my eyes i had decided my fate 20 minutes ago. ""Okay, we got you a fresh rig"".

As he reached up into a little hidden cupboard for the box of needles, i kinda saw my life flash before my eyes right there. What would my mom think of me now? 

I was in for the electrocution of a lifetime now...

Holy fuck. I've wanted to try this drug for fucking ages. I've done almost every opiate/opioid and I kinda wanted to just be able to say I've done it, really. Heard people say it's the closest thing to oxy without being oxy.

Well last night I did it. Started at 100mg and then kept dosing for a solid few hours till I'd done 400mgs. Was alright I guess, nothing to rave about. Wouldn't really recommend it even if what I'm about to explain had't happened.

So I wake up like 8 hours later. My head is fucking POUNDING. I drink some water and instantly fall asleep again.

2 hours later I wake up. Head is pounding again but I sit up and drink. Everything feels 'off' but can't place what.

I go to stand up and become extremely dizzy but stumble to the bathroom. My vision is completely fucked, like when you stand up really quickly sometimes and it's almost like you're blacking out (orthostatic hypotension).

I feel fucking awful but cannot tell or place why. My head is pounding and I'm struggling to concentrate on anything.

I decide to jump in the shower. I'm hot. Unusually hot. As I'm showering my chest becomes insanely tight and I suddenly start to freak the fuck out because I have no idea what's happening to me. Suddenly I realise the tight feeling in my chest isn't really tightness in my chest, it's my body telling me it's about to vomit.

I jump out the shower and vomit 4 times. 

I feel a little bit better but still feel WEIRD. And still quite shit.

After my shower I was feeling even better so calmed myself down. I go to clean my teeth and I'm brushing when I look in the mirror and see a man in the doorway behind me. Blink. Gone. It made me actually physically jump in fright.

Then I'm freaking the fuck out. But get dressed and sit on my bed on my computer. Then the auditory hallucinations start. FUCKED UP ones too. A female voice I've never heard before talking about killing people?

At this point I decide that I need to pop a benzo to stop these hallucinations otherwise I risk actually falling into psychosis (they were freaking me the fuck out and every time they happened I was getting more and more stressed).

I pop 1mg clonazepam under my tongue (praise the lord for clonaz). It works and the hallucinations subside. I do some stuff and for a while, although I feel ""off"" I'm okay. I eat a little and feel on the mend but I am having difficulty concentrating and I'm worried because I have to study for a final I have tomorrow.

Then it's like 1pm and I sit in my bed and I just fall asleep. Like boom. I keep waking up every hour or so and trying to stir myself but it's physically impossible. I have enough time to set an alarm on my phone and then I'm out.

I sleep 4-5 hours and then finally I'm able to stir myself but the audible hallucinations are back and I feel even more weird. I take more clonaz.

I start freaking the fuck out because I am like a vegetable. I can't do anything. If I go to text someone on my phone, by the time I've got half way through my sentence my eyes close and I drop my phone and then a few moments later I 'come to' and it takes me a moment to recollect myself and I get back to texting. I MAY be able to finish the sentence before it happens again. And this is for everything I do. I go to my laptop and want to go to youtube. I type ""yout"" and by the time I'd got to there, I'd blacked out again, and then came to. This went on for like 2 hours until I had a shower and really moved around a bit which seemed to fix things.

It helped but not completely, and I'm like ""I need a stim or I can't study"" so go and get some caffeinated drinks, which appear to help.

Now I'm sitting here balancing my caffeine intake extremely carefully because too much and I feel really fucking weird but i HAVE to study.

I'm throwing that shit. It fucks with your serotonin system. I can tell by the type of hallucinations I was having. Fucking dark, extremely realistic and scary. Thank fucking god I had a benzo because I felt like I was going mental and I'd consider myself someone who has a 'strong mind' I suppose.

Be careful with that shit guys.

tl;dr - took 400mg over evening. woke up, felt extremely ill. vomitted 4 times. audible + visual hallucinations. still feel off 24hrs after initial ingestion.",1528059238.0

Roughly six weeks ago maybe 2 months I injected into my left arm and I hit an artery I've been injecting for 12 plus years and I've never come across this phenomenon. I've injected into that same left arm on three occasions now for after that this one being the 4th on every occasion my arm is the same thing as it did that one time it feel as if fire is flowing through my veins especially my Palms hurt. I know for a fact I'm not an artery because the blood is not bright red but he darker almost purple color second because there's no way that I just happened to hitting artery in for completely different spots they're not even close to each other. It even starts to burn if I don't inject I'll stick the tip of the syringe in and the whole time. My question is why is it that no matter where I hit weather it's a used fit or a brand new one it burns I get hives and pretty much the same results happen as when I hit the artery that one time today I hit a vein one that I've hit for years now same symptoms occur and like I said I've hit this vein for at least 5 years now I still feel the rush but this time I didn't and like I said I stopped as soon as it starts to feel any pain.. today I actually felt no pain as I got about halfway through the injection and I drew back a second time halfway through injecting as I always do it's just habit I want to make sure I'm still on the vein and I was and as I started to inject the rest of what was left and as he got a little bit more and I started to feel the pain not as painful as the first few times but still a pain my arm got covered in hives not as bad again but still my palm hurt my hand hurt my whole arm hurt and even swell up a little bit I took Benadryl to ease the swelling and now it's gone no rush at all happened whatsoever I cooked up another one this time hit my right arm or should I say right hand I pulled back and register twice and even a third time to make absolutely 100% sure I was in the vein last time I hit this vein and develop cellulitis and it was a bad experience so I took extra precaution and made to register as much as I could to make sure I wasn't and blast off got about 60 units in registering pull back 10 more units and once again it was still in the vein or it registered at least and I finished it off Upon finishing it off put my hand a few times and waited about 2 minutes no rush at all so no rush for the first one or the second injection either I must have injected 0.35-0.40 each one now I feel a bit tired but I'm not sure if that's because I'm high or not last night or two nights ago maybe you will have any idea as to explain to me the phenomenon that's going on here? Why no rush on either shot? And why is it that ever since someone hit my vein for me I've never really in my life missed that much of a shot and whenever I miss you in one or two units I stop immediately I've never in 12 plus years stroking artery I myself or anybody else. Anytime I drew back and knew that I was in artery I never even injected the blood and the brightness of it gave it away every time ever since I made the mistake of doing that this is what's been going on like I said can anybody please tell me how to fix this because now I just wasted a majority of the 1.5gs I had and although I'm well I feel no rush or am I high I'm a little sleepy but I'm not entirely sure if that's hitting an artery or simply feeling sick little bit. Even when I have it injected I will stick the tip of the needle into my left arm whether it be in my hand forearm or ever and even without injection is still starts to burn just from sticking a needle in and it's a pain that I cannot describe because it's pain like no other and it occurs every single time I attempt to inject into my left arm no matter where they hit no matter where I am poking I get the same sensation the same hives the same pain and no rush or if I do Rush the pain and anxiety over, so I barely get to feel it I felt I do rush at all. When I hit my right arm no problems like this always rush when I have my legs no problems the rush is good strong and painless. Extremities I'm going through are these normal? Is it normal to not be able to hit my arm that I hit an artery in even 6 to 8 weeks later after the incident? I mean yea I'm worried but the same time I feel okay I'm more concerned with the fact that I won't be able to hit in my left arm ever again without experiencing swelling like this and pain. Like I said the second shot I check registry every time I pulled back but why injecting take your phone no rush no high , does anybody have any idea why this may continue to be happening it's been four different spots to so it's not like a repetitively Pony the same hole that I poked when I got the missing vein and his artery in the first place I rotate spots I'm also using a brand new fit every single time most of the time I don't even jacked it just starts to burn like I am as soon as I Put the Needle in and I pull out for instance yesterday I want to see if anybody else me if have this issue or e how it can possibly be fixed I would love to hear what works for you or at least what's going on with me thanks for listening guys much love bropiared and happy nods. Hopefully I figure out what's going on soon because I'm seriously just about to throw my fix get away and give this up all together it's not worth it especially in cases like this I'm too old for this stuff and my life is too important thank you guys for listening and letting me vent shitpost over",1528055913.0

So my story is long but ill keep it short. I relapsed about 16 days ago on dope. Before that I had a relapse about 3 months ago on dope again. So i only used 2 times within like the last year. And both times I did it it just made me feel sick and pushed me harder to stay clean. 

Now I really dont know if i want to be clean or what. I think I do, stuff is going good for me without opiates. But part of me craves benzos or pharmaceutical opiates. The dope is trash now and %99 of all dope contains fent or fent analogues. So sometimes I crave doing some 30s. I can get them 10 mins away from me too, but i havent got any in years.

I know benzos bring bad things to me and so do opiates but i still have many days where I want to change how I'm feeling so I think about how much happier and better everything would be if i was high. I used to love going to work high, it was fun and pretty entertaining. Now going in sober, some days can last really long and sometimes i get an overwhelming sence of anxiety and depression. Like crippling anxiety. Part of me wants to get back on xanax cuz i used to be prescribed it. But i would abuse them sometimes and end up doing stupid shit like smoking crack. (Fuck crack I never wana touch that shit again, makes me feel like im going to die, seriously) 

So sorry about the rant but i would apprciate it if anyone can leave me some feed back.

On the 28th of this month, my year of probation for having a weed pipe (yay deep south and crazy strict laws) will be over. Before being sentenced, I knew it was coming so I got on methadone as I knew my likelihood of stayed 100% clean the whole time and taking zero chances were very slim. I've had absolutely no problems with wanting to use since I started MMT but I'm not sure how big the fact that I knew I had random monthly tests at my clinic on top of totally random ones thru probation was in helping me not really think about using. With the 28th coming up, I'm not really worrying/thinking about using but I'm definitely worried about that changing. I really feel i was mentally prepared to start MMT for the right reasons and the upcoming probation was the final factor in my decision but I still worry about how I'll feel once I have my freedom back. I will absolutely start smoking weed again as I have never destroyed my life over it like opiates. I suppose it's good that I already know I'll be using weed again but haven't even thought about using opiates again to ""celebrate"" like I would have done in the past.

In around 2005, my house was raided because apparently someome ratted on me to save their own ass. Needless to say, the police were VERY disappointed with what they found versus what they were told they would find. My initial charges were seriously trumped up (I suspect to make my later felony plea deal seem all the more desirable). I ended up pleading guilty to possession of hydrocodone (2.5 lortab is what I had as far as hydro goes). I got a 3 year suspended sentence to be served on probation. Was supposed to have atleast 1 random drug test a month from my PO but I had a total of zero. I had 2 from the judge which I knew about 2-3 months beforehand. I used most weekends after the first few months. My probation was terminated after only 1.5 years and I went immediately back to daily use until pretty much a year ago. 

As I said, this was mostly to vent plus it ended up being longer than I expected but I wanted to know of anyone has been in a similar situation? How did you handle your freedom once you got it back? I get 110mg/day methadone but that gives me some pain control for ~5-6 hours and a slight glow for the same amount of time after dosing. No nod or anything like that. I also am prescribed a very large amount of Xanax daily but only binge on that for a weekend or 2 after getting my script and I've built up quite a stockpile with the rest. The only drug I just cannot stop myself with is opiates so that is why I am worried. I've used for over 15 years so I realize that I'm quite likely to die each time I use again just based on the amount of time I've been using.

Sorry for the rambling/ranting/bullshit. Hope everyone is doing well this weekend!

tldr; get off probation on the 28th. Worried I will start using opiates recreationally again even tho I've done very well on methadone the past month. ",1528040257.0

My first experience with any opiate at all was this morning. I took 20mg hydrocodone at 7:00am. I woke up at noon ate some food, took a shower and re dosed 20mg and ended up falling asleep again until 5:30pm. My dreams have been very vivid also its been hard AF to take a shit. Also I have not jacked off all day. Like I know its there I just do not feel like it. Im planning on taking 10mg before I go back to sleep as this drug just seems to make me sleepy. But when people described opiates to me and how they were wrapped in a blanket of euphoria I will admit this shit is kinda underwhelming. I feel relaxed and a little numb and generally “ok”. Its a very calm and not in your face kinda drug.  But then again maybe it is because I have never been dope sick before. So my favorite part of this experience was I the “nod” (Daydreaming with your eyes closed idk lol).

Im from u.k, but any help with done will help","Basically i have been addicted for 2 years, i have relapsed over 20 times now and always fall back into relapse, everytime digging a bigger hole and spending loads more money etc.

I am wondering if going on methadone is a choice that could help stabalise my life for a little bit? As i am worried this cycle is going to kill me, or st least ruin my relationship with my family and friends etc.

Nobody knows that i use, would i be able to hid my methadone use? As in i wont be telling anyone anyway, but would it be obvious? 

People say dont go on methadone just cold turkey, which is fine,n but i always emd up relapsing which is the main problem...

Can you go out for a few drinks in the evening, say  a few pints of beer? Or is no drinking a must on methadone?

Please, any help anyond can give me will be masivley appreciated.

After all we are merely the result of billions of years of evolution. Nothing more than a sentient bag of flesh. Doesn’t that amaze you? We are seven billion people in this world all different from each other, yet strangely all the same. When I’m in the metro going back to my parents’ house after some class at school, I think to myself: this train passes every 5 minutes, and every time, thousands get off, thousands hop on, all having somewhere to go, something to do, someone to see. We are so insignificant et yet so powerful. I don’t know how to make a battery, let alone a laptop, yet electronics play a crucial role in my life. How did we go from apes to humans? We know the how, we just don’t know the why. After millions of years of evolution, humans never found their rivals. I mean yeah, animals are pretty intelligent in their own ways, but no animal comes even close to our level. We
At twenty years I trying to find my place in the world. Convincing myself that my menial job of delivering pizzas and studying finance for ten hours a week is a fulfilling life. Life is dull, life is pain. Pain that you’re not good enough, pain of failure. Pain can often times be derived by fear, and anxiety. Anxiety that all your friends will surpass you, if they haven’t already. Fear of seeing you little sister fail while following your path. Fear of never being able to by that GTI, or that RSX, or even just that Civic, that I should have been able to get by now. Fear that I’ll never move out of my parents’ house. That at thirty years old I will be the only one after Brandon and eventually Joseph, that is still working at that pizza joint. Fear that everyone will move on with life, and that I will be left behind. When the good old days of closing together and getting high afterwards will be gone. Fear that my parents will have spent four thousand dollars a year for nothing. Sending me to private school while waking up at 7 am on Saturdays to drive me all the way across the city for swimming lessons, then back the other way for Kung Fu. Obviously then followed by scouts. 
Everyday I have this intense fear that I will not be good enough. When you always hear “you’re very intelligent”, “you’ll go far in life”, you’re not like the others”, well what happens in the end when you don’t? What happens when you don’t become that doctor, when you don’t follow the path that way drawn for you. I had everything to succeed: relatively comfortable household with supportive parents. Healthy lifestyles, good friends, top schools, no mental health issues. Every was handed to me on a sliver plate, yet I managed to spill the contents and pawn the platter for drugs. 
While I get anxious about life, about all this bullshit, I sit down in my shitty corolla grind my weed in one hand and roll up the filter afterwards. The sweet smell rises in the air directly into my nostril. The green goes in the paper filling it up to the brim. Roll it, lick it, twist it, light it. Inhale the good shit and exhale the bullshit. As the marijuana smoke enters my lungs, the tiny capillaries in my lungs diffuse the THC into my heart. This muscle’s relentless work allows the drug to reach my brain in a matter of seconds. My brain loves it. My head feels heavy and foggy, I smile and put on some music, I fee a tingling sensation in my stomach. I am in a state of pure happiness. If I die right now, I know I will die happy. 
Tonight, is a special night. We’re going to the club. My friends and I have decided it would be best instead of renting a cabin for the weekend. I’m ready. I don’t care if I’m broke these days, but I need this. Walk up to the bar, shot of Jägermeister. Say hi to people, talk about school and life. It’s not so bad after all. I do enjoy talking to them. Steven shows me the bag of gummies. Delicious but, let’s be honest, it’s some pretty weak shit. I have to act surprised, as if this little piece of candy will elevate this party to the next level. I still take one, cause, why the hell not. But that got me thinking I should probably pop my Xanax. I order shot and break off a quarter of bar.
 God I love these white little magic pills. Even at ten dollars a pop, all I need is a quarter bar and I’m good. It lowers my inhibitions, I get loose and talkative, no filter to my speech. Another shot, I’m looking for that sweet spot, that sweet spot where my other drug comes into play. I don’t wanna pull it out too soon. I want to be fucked up enough to enjoy it. That’s the thing about coke… on it’s own it’s kinda underwhelming. But in the right condition, it can be heavenly. I go to the bar, shot. On the dance floor the music  is blasting, I’m jumping around this is fun.  I don’t give a fuck about anything. We take another shot. This is the moment. I tell Joseph I’m going to the bathroom and he follows me. We get in the stall and I pull it out. The little magic bag. Happiness in powder form! I dump some on my phone. Crush it up good. No chunks. The ritual is almost as fun as doing it. I chop up my line and a smaller one for Joseph. He takes it without hesitation. Weird, he usually makes a fuss about doing cocaine. He doesn’t really like it. But he still got in the fucking stall! Go figure! I drunkenly roll up a 20 dollar bill and snort my line. I instantly feel alive. Everything is good. The cocaine molecules just hit the capillaries in my nose and they are getting into my bloodstream. My heart beats faster. I am in a total state of euphoria, probably smiling line an idiot. 

We get out of the stall laughing and dancing to the beat. We go back to the join our friends, nobody knows what we just did. That’s the thrill. But what can I do to feel even better? I drank, I ate some THC and some benzos, I just snorted some blow, but my brain is still fiending for a higher level of intoxication, of more gettness and more giuness. Oh I know. A cigarette. Now is the perfect time to go smoke. I ask Brandon if he wants to smoke. He likes smoking. He’s not the type of person to smoke a shitton or drink or do drugs, but he sure does like smoking cigarettes. But only good cigarettes, the type that costs 15 dollars a pack. None of that  john players shit. Brandon likes the finer things in life, which explains the 2009 Lexus he bought with 150 000 kilometers on it. We go outside and Brandon hands me a Benson and Hedges cigarette. I light it, draw up and blow out a puff of smoke. It’s a cold march night, but I’m feeling warm. Or am I just too drunk to feel it? I instantly feel the rush of nicotine hit my brain. I feel blessed. As he tip of my B&H  cigarette glows bright with every draw, I think about life. Here I am intoxicated out of my mind, smoking cancer sticks, but I love it. Slowly killing myself is the only time I truly feel alive. 
I come back home, stumbling and drunkenly unlock the front door. My mom is standing there asking me how the night went in a judgemental tone. She doesn’t like the fact that I was out until 2-3am, which isn’t even that bad considering my coke fueled parties sometimes last until dawn. Little did she know, my night has not ended yet. 
These friends of mine are very vanilla compared to my other group of friends, my frat brothers. They get to the club at 10pm and leave get a few drinks, dance a bit and leave around 2 am. But I am not done yet. I go to my room and reach my hiding spot wear I keep my stash. The anticipation is such a rush. (Even just writing this gives me butterflies). I take my parafanelia and head to the bathroom. I lock the door and get hot water running. I crush up 3 8mg dilaudid between two spoons, the brand name of my favorite drug. The love of my life, hydromorphone. These little white triangular pills with 8 on one side and two Ds on the other. I drop the powder in my syringe and add some water. I lube up the back door and shake the syringe to dilute my drug. I lay down on my tummy and slowly insert the tip of the plastic syringe in me. I quickly get it in. I can’t wait to get fucking high, blast off. I push the plunger and hot water gushes through my colon. I wait a bit to make sure all the drug gets absorbed. I take my pone out and start browsing facebook and youtube. By the time I finish a three minute video, a warm blanket covers me. I take out the syringe and get myself up. I feel heavy and my eyes are almost shut. I am in a state of pure euphoria. My body is completely numb. I fucking love my life. I curl up in my bed warm and high. My eyes are half closed, and my mouth is open. I dream of random stuff while my whole body goes through waves of and orgasmic feeling. My face looks dumb and I probably have a stupid grin on my face, but I am in heaven. I love this.

I go inside and cook both myself and him up a shot and divide it up, giving him a little less than me (his tolerance is lower than mine), I do my shot first because I have to hit him too.

So I do my shot and immediately notice something is ""off"" about it, didn't get that taste in my mouth that tar always gives me. Plus the overall high / feeling was dramatically different than normal so I assumed I got an extreemly heavy fent bag. 

I proceed to shoot out even more of my boyfriends shot, now very weary about it. I normally have a lot of trouble finding a good vein on him but tonight I had no trouble and got the boy done real quick, which was a good thing becsuse I was starting to catch a nod and my vision was becoming distorted(I don't know how else to describe it).

A few minutes pass and I'm brought out of my nod by this strange noise that I at first thought was an animal. I turn around and see my boyfriend laying on the bed, unable to breathe. I jumped up and tried to give him some oxygen via rescue breathing.  After about fifteen seconds of this I realize I need to act now and start to panic as I force myself not to freeze up.

I grab my kit which was laying on the ground (I took some photos of my kit and dope for some dope porn for this Reddit.. ikr) and grab my Narcan nasal spray and give my boyfriend one spray, me- still panicking and afraid it wasn't any good or had expired; I grab an unopened nasal spray and use that one. After that I went and grabbed my actual vial of narcan and slammed my syringe into it and tried pulling up the solution with my trembling hands. 

While trying to draw narcan into a syringe, my boyfriend sits up in bed and then completly stands up off of the bed, with a puzzled look on his face looking at a disheveled me frantically stabbing a syringe into a vial so forcefully the syringe bended.

A total of a minute and a half elapsed but it was the longest time of my life, I had shouted ""someone call an ambulance"" when it happened but didn't realize my roommate was out; another second and I would've called them.

After explaining everything to my boyfriend he doesn't want to go to the hospital, but me and him both agree it is ""time"" to try and put the demons to rest. 

I don't know what else I have on my mind, but what I do know is I needed to tell somebody, to talk to someone...

History - starting using opiates about 2 years ago with 15 mg oxys and never really got past 45mg in one day mark and then tried heroin.
The heroin - at first it was brown and flaky and the drip reminded me of licorice. I would do a few bags here and there and honestly thought of the high as mellow at first and not as strong as oxy.  
Then my dude starting getting this white stuff.  It was usually straight powder that didn’t need to be cut up much but sometimes has soft chucks in it.  My friend did 3-4 at once the first time and was throwing up for hours and almost losing consciousness.  For a while I could just do half a bag and this was this the first time I really got a rush from the stuff and felt extreme euphoria. This was all sniffing.  That’s when stuff got really bad and eventually I was doing 14 or more a day 5 at a time and couldn’t do less then 9 in a day without feeling pretty bad.  
My friend tried to come off of it once pretty cold turkey and after 2 and a half days he was vomiting bile every 15 minutes and thought he would actually die and gave in.  I came off of it once or twice and it was terrible and lasted a weeks but I never had the yellow bile and always started using again pretty soon after. 
I recently started suboxone because I was doing 14 or more daily and my friend, who is the only other person I know who used the same stuff, convinced me I could die from withdrawal from producing so much bile.  It was a great decition but it took 55 hours until I felt sick enough to induce which was crazy.  24 hours I felt fine and 48 hours after last dose I was only like a 5-6 on cows and wasn’t risking it.  
Anyway I’m convinced it was basically fent or a fent analog but some people have said otherwise and I’m just curious if anyone else has had experience with something like this.

In cases where people with big tolerances try to induct on suboxone, what typically happens is a few days or more of pretty miserable semi\-WDs that, once you've taken a blocking dose of suboxone \(say 4mg or more\) there is nothing you can do about but suffer through or return to your DOC, which won't work very well for the next few days.

1) I used to always get high off them, I just need more now. Probably built a tolerance?
 
2)My boys who are lighter/smaller than me still get wasted after one or two pills.

3) The dealer used to go to Community College with one of the boys, this is how we got to him. Not just random dude online or on the street.

4) He fronts us many times and we always pay him back, sometimes even tell him keep the change.

Just got wisdom teeth out four days ago. They prescribed me a TONNE of Vicodin and I feel incredibly addicted to the rush. I will eventually have to stop soon, due to only having a few days left, but the high is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I can see myself easily getting addicted to this. I absolutely love the heavy/light feeling and the warm waves that just seem to pass over you. I have never felt so comfortable in my own skin.   
This experience has been such an eye\-opening experience to opiates and people who use them regularly, and I have so much respect for people who deal with addiction.

Anyways...

Is there any cause of concern for me? What is the next course of action?  Is an addiction to this substance really that dangerous? I've noticed increased productivity, and incredible creative sessions \(I am a musician\), and an improved relationship with the people around me \(I usually argue with my father multiple times a day, and hasn't happened once since taking this drug, and we've grown closer.\)

Ring after ring and she’s trying to hang up, to be tough, but she can’t. The sickness is setting in and her willpower won’t last.
He answers- will meet her in 10, the bill clasped in her hand as she drives to the spot
And willing or not she knows she’ll do anything for that shot.
Driving home as fast as she can, watching out for the cops and knowing if she’s caught they’re going to make her stop.
She rushes in the door, quickly finds her box-
Rigs, spoon, cotton, calling her name and ready to be used.
Even if her mind refused her body would still know what to do- it’s too late now.
Her mind is screaming, begging and pleading, don’t do it. You don’t want it, you can’t go through with it- but she’s already got the bag open.
The rush that she feels as she’s prepping the rig is almost the same as when she puts the needle in, but she needs more. 
Numbness and silence, that’s what she’s looking for- nothing else will do.
She loads it, ties off, finds the perfect vein- at least the ones she hasn’t blown out again and again. Track marks on her arms are the scars of the peace she tries to gain.
She finds it, a sharp pain as the needle goes in, but it’s all part of the ritual she has to complete. She admits defeat and pushes the plunger down.
No pain, no cares, no sound. Immediate relief is found, body trembling as the pins and needles go up and down and she’s finally happy.
She knows it’s momentary but nothing else matters, her fears and worries have shattered, thoughts fleeting and scattered but that’s how she likes it. 
But something feels wrong. Her eyes are heavier than they should be, she’s forgetting to breathe, but there’s no fear. She hasn’t wanted to be here on this earth for a while now and maybe this time they’ll let her down, let her rest.
Maybe it’s a test but she doesn’t care, she wants to fail.
She closes her eyes and the blackness, the silence becomes real.
.
.
.
.
.
.
She opens her eyes. She starts to cry when she begins to realize she’s alive. 
Maybe tomorrow she’ll try to live, or she’ll do it again, the struggle to overcome or give in.
Until next time.",1527989296.0

8o561i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8o561i/your_iv_horror_stories/,32,https://redd.it/8o561i,NotJenna1,Your IV Horror Stories,"i was having this conversation with my dealer earlier today, and it was actually a really interesting, albeit terrifying, conversation between us. i've never actually posted in the forum before, i'm more of a lurker, but i thought this thread might actually start some interesting conversations/stories.

so i'll start. prior to this, i hadn't had any IVing horror stories, because i might be a junkie, but i was always a clean, smart one. always bought new rigs, only used each one about 2-3 times and then threw it away, and i always made sure everything was clean and sanitized. but then one night, right around this time last year, one of my best friends and i were staying up all night, shooting a TON of fent -- before anyone starts in on me, YES, i know how insanely dangerous IVing fent is, because even if you're off by just a tiny, tiny microgram, you could very easily OD, and not to defend myself for my stupidity, but i wasn't doing it alone, and i'm always stocked up with narcan in the event anything should ever happen (thank you, god, it never has).

anyway, the rig i was using, i had been using all night because i was down to my last one and no pharmacies around me are open at 2 am. so i stuck the needle into my arm, and when i went to pull it out... the entire needle was missing and stuck in my arm. i was hitting the vein right in the crook of my elbow, so when i freaked out and bent my arm, it pushed the metal deeper into my skin and i couldn't get it out. i was LOSING MY MIND. my friend helped me try to get it out, but it was so deeply in there, and if i remember correctly, it was underneath the vein, so there was no getting to it.

i knew i couldn't go through my life with this piece of metal stuck in my arm. i could get a horrible infection, not to mention that every time i bent my elbow, the needle dug deeper into my arm and was EXTREMELY painful. so what did i do? well, i had to go to the ER and tell them i was an IV opiate addict and that a needle had snapped off in my arm. luckily, in the haze of fentanyl and the pain of a needle digging into my arm, my friend and i were smart enough to take the ferry over to the next state and go to the ER there. i'm not dumb (well, i am, if you only know me through this story), i knew if i went to my hometown ER, i would instantly be put on the blacklist for painkillers, because they'd know i was an addict and they'd consider me a drug seeker. it was a rather smart decision, because since then i've had to go to my hometown ER when i broke my finger at work, and thank you god, i was not blacklisted there, so they were quick with handing out the IV dilaudid while i was in the ER, and then sent me home with 7.5 mg percocets, as well. anyway, i digress.

long story short, the needle had moved underneath the vein in my arm and couldn't be reached without a surgeon cutting my arm open. so they numbed me up, sliced into my arm, pulled the broken needle out, stitched me up, and sent me on my way... with no painkillers, even though my arm was profusely bleeding still and i was in a lot of pain. because every time i had moved my arm, the needle was stabbing the muscle that it was sitting on top of. so it was LEGITIMATELY painful and they definitely would have sent anyone else home with painkillers, but not this guy, because they knew i was an opiate addict. so they kicked me some extra strength ibuprofen and home i went.

so there you go, that's MY IV horror story. what are yours? :) ",1527988693.0

And a question about ""middles"" at the end!","Not a religious girl, but I do love Junkie Jesus! Today, He visited in the form of Norcos for $1.50 each!! 😍
I had called everyone I know who sells pills and felt like such shit lol, anxiety was kicking my ass and I didn't sleep last night. Husband decided to ask one of his workers for me, since we knew his mom had just had surgery, and she likes husband for giving her son a job, since a lot of people won't give him a chance (psych background, but eager to please, sweet as can be and a helluva worker). She couldn't get rid of them all since she just had surgery, but she parted with 25 of them for $40 (we just let them keep the change from $40 since it was like $2.50, and we're the ones getting a deal).

Now I can play the waiting game without anxiety and not feel so shitty while I wait for either this really flaky guy to come through (he quit answering Facebook messages 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻), or for my regular ""middle"" lady to call back... I can't understand why it's so freakin dry around here, I thought a lot of people get prescriptions near the first lol. I just don't want more morphine from my neighbor lol, I'd almost rather have gabapentin, at least those help me sleep!! 😂😂😂 I never did try the ""boofing"" with the morphine, but damn they are pretty useless orally lol. 

I've got some 90s rock going, trying to drown out the fighting from my neighbors, and I can finally have a cup of coffee since the cheap Norcos kill my anxiety!

I've been scrolling this sub, wanting to lick my screen at all the pill porn lol 😂😍😂😜

Question about ""middles""... My regular lady charges a ""finders fee"" which really pisses my husband off. It's normal, isn't it?!?! Like, I wouldn't expect her to take time out of her day to make phone calls and all that for nothing! Husband said she's upcharging us for pills already and then to add a fee on top of it is ridiculous. I think it's normal and it's honestly how she makes her money, like she doesn't have a job or anything. And, when they are her pills, she doesn't charge the fee. Husband thinks I am naive, I think I'm super realistic lol. Just wanted to see what you guys thought! 😊😊

But, which opioids did you try with this ROA? I did plently of O\-DSMT, Heroin and Moprhin with this ROA and it was really a great feeling. not as good as shooting it up, but much more safely as banging. The rush is nice and comes within a couple minutes and also, the bioavailability is much higher. for example heroin: its about 30\-40&#37; smoking, 80&#37; snorting and about 100&#37; injecting. i'd guess rectally injection is about 85\-100&#37;.  


share your experience. \(which opioid, ROA, feeling compared to other ROAS\)

He somehow gets into telling me all about his random hookups, mostly all of them made possible thanks to the grindr app. As fate would have it, right that moment, he gets a text from one of his grindr hookups and proceeds to tell me about their ""relationship""...

Basically, he meets this dude usually once a week at the local porn shop. He's an older, married guy who likes to get groped in public. So they go into the back part of the porn shop where they have the little theaters with porn playing and also these tiny private rooms. My buddy will grope his package out in the open a few times and then go into a private room and help him finish. Dude pays him $200 every time for this.

I'm hearing this and can't help but think to myself ""Damn, I won't lie, if I was bi or gay, I'd be all over this"". Then, the wheels in my brain start turning and now I'm trying to think how I could possibly get involved in this ""deal"" without doing anything I don't want to do or feel comfortable doing. If it wasn't for the speed, I don't think I ever would have gotten on this line of thinking, but I digress.  All I knew was that within the next 12-24 hours, I'd be coming down from the speed and craving dope. But, I was broke and dopeless. That being said, naturally, I laid out my idea to my buddy to hear his thoughts.

I am 100% straight and completely comfortable with my sexuality. I really don't think anything I would do or say would really make me question that, so maybe that's why I was willing to participate. With that said, I still did not want to blow or jerk off or really have much of any physical contact with this random old dude. So I suggested to my buddy, to suggest to this guy, that I come with, rub up against this dude's shit outside his pants, and then just watch the rest of it go down. Since he's into voyeurism and all or whatever. As luck would have it, my physical description, and the fact that I'm a straight dude, is right up this guy's alley and he's IN. He comes out and offers us $600 cash for our time. So $300 each. Morals be damned, I couldn't turn it down.

I'm not gonna go into major detail about the actual events, because it wasn't all that exciting and I've already written half a book. But yeah. We went. At first, it was super fucking weird for me but I just kept thinking how I just need to push through for the $300 at the end. 

Well, this shit ended up being a breeze. Here was my ""participation""....I literally brushed up against this guys junk on two separate occasions. Didn't touch anything directly really. Total of about 45 seconds. Then the rest of the time I ""watched"" those two do whatever they did and had my hand in my pants, but I was really just watching porn on my phone of some hot teens with big tits. Still couldn't get hard though.

The whole thing lasted 15-20 minutes tops. Guy discreetly gave us the $600 cash and we got out of there and went back home. Made it back home within the hour. And we were each $300 richer. I immediately hit up the dopeman for 2 bundles and all in all....I was a happy camper.

Am I proud of it? Not really. But shit, I didn't cross any of my personal boundaries and it was hands down the easiest, quickest $300 of my life. ",1527950542.0

He fronted me a couple 80s a week ago and they looked really real so I popped half of one no tolerance.

This high was very unpleasant my eyes couldn’t stay open, I projectile vomited and was way to high

I didn’t think it was fent still maybe just because I had no tolerance so the next day I took another 40 and the high was so strong I puked my guts up 3 times I could barely talk or stay awake.

So I text the guy asking if it’s a fenty press and he swears it isn’t and gives me all this shit about how he would never do that to his customer

Well it turns out this guy is selling dilaudid that’s laced with fentanyl apparently there’s hotspots in which one pill is as potent as 8 of them...

My physical symptoms: My face went completely numb, my vision went blurry, I had the worst ringing in my ears that you can ever imagine, to the point that I couldn’t hear anything else. My head felt like someone was hitting it with a hammer, my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest and I felt like I was having the worst anxiety attack ever, maybe close to having a heart attack. I fell to the floor panicking while my girlfriend held me down and tried to calm me down for what felt like 15 mins but she said it only lasted 5 mins. The next 30 mins after that I had low auditory ringing and a nasty headache that’s slowly started to decline in intensity.

The mental symptoms I experienced were even worse, I really thought I was going to die which made my anxiety unbearable. I had visual and auditory hallucinations like seeing shadow people, intense visual snow, and hearing whispers. I thought I was going to be fucked up forever. 

Can someone please tell me if I should call 911 or go to a doctor tomorrow? I’m still having extreme anxiety and my chest and left arm are still numb from the experience. My heartbeat has slowly gotten better but it’s still going a million miles a minute and it’s been about an hour from the incident as I type this. I don’t feel there anymore and disassociated intensely and wondering if I should see a psychiatrist. My girlfriend and I came to the conclusion that I accidentally put all coke and no china in the shot which made me almost OD on the coke if that’s even possible. Sorry for the rambling, you guys are the only people I can go to and I’m just so confused on what to do.

Also do undercovers have long hair ever? Or beards?","So this morning I went to go cop, at like 2 am. I got my shit and  I'm sitting  in the same parking spot of the apartment complex I copped at prepping my speedball. So I blast off and decide I wanted to have just some coke in my next shot since ther wasn't enough in the first one. So I'm makling this shot and some spills out of the bag onto my passanger seat and I'm cleaning up etc. This is all  taking time and at some point I see a white guy with a longish hair  he's beard thats tatted up with long hair and dressed kinda fantsy like, He's a few cars down but I'm fairly certain he can't see my rig or anything. But if he looked into my car he would've seen me and the street lamp probbably gave him enough light to see a young, well dressed, clean cut white kid who doesn't belong in the City named after an Indian, and who probbably lives in one of the nicer white towns a bit up north. So anyways I see him run from his car to what appears to be an apartment. I didn't look too long though so I didnt see exactly where he ran too. He comes back a minute or 2 later with a cigarette in mouth and gets into his car. So while all this is going on I'm looking for my rig in my car and can't find it so I open the door and step out to get a better view. The boy bagy was in my door and the wind took it out which blows massive donkey dicks. So I look for my phone and decide I want to start looking for the bagy and my shot can wait. I'm also barefoot which I'm sure looks sketchy as fuck. So I step lut onto the parking area and start scanning with my phone but obly to no avail. I quickly noticed 2 cars which looked to be the county sherrifs  sitting in the road with their lights pointed at the row of cars I'm in. I tried not to look like I was poanicking and running away so I continued my search acting like I belonged there and was looking for something I dropped. Then I turned around and walked like 3 to 4 feet back to my car to try and clean everything up. There was some coke on my seat  and the passanger seat,  freshly  used rig, and credit card with white powder on it. I scambled to get everything as clean as possible before they come over to where I'm at wich is probbably going to be impossible. Lucky for me they probbably had some serious call going on since they  just  drove  past me  and  a few minutes later I hear their sirens go off. So basically I think the white guy from earlier is infact an undercover since he was wite, fit, young, and dressed well. He ran out saw me in my car, rand back in and left and called his buddies in, who pulled up a decent amount away from me, but I'm sure they were looking directly at my head, wondering what I was doing. They were most likely looking for a reason to stop me and question me but sat there for a few minutes since Iwasn't doing anything they could stop me for. Or I'm overthinking it and the 2 of them might've just been on patrol in the same complex in 2 different cars.

On a serious note though, I understand why someone is willing to die for the feeling of being high because it's FUCKING GREAT, but at what cost guys? Thinking about the costs generates MORE guilt and perpetuates excuses to use, so don't think too hard. Life is easy when you can't feel, but is that really living?

This isn't me hating on anybody because as I see it, to each their own and as long as you aren't bothering me or someone else, nobody else should be bothering you.

If you wanna addict then by all means please addict, if you wanna detox then detox. Drugs are so in the moment, step back for a second and figure out which one you want to go with, but be true to and honest with yourself.

What do you want out of life? I don't want to see anymore of you guys dying because of hot bags of dope or pressies, but y'all are gonna do what you're gonna do and I get that.

8nz711,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8nz711/chronic_pain_tightrope/,5,https://redd.it/8nz711,life_wasted_again,Chronic Pain Tight-Rope,"I'm gonna preface this post by saying that yes I'm aware that this isn't /r/chronicpain, but I feel as if this is the community this post truly belongs in. I want to start by giving a bit of vague backstory about myself and my experience with chronic pain from an early age, alongside anxiety and occasional depression.

Well, the first drug that I ever took was half of a .25mg Xanax that was given to me by a parent, but although I only had this one experience, it seemed to have opened the gates in my mind to a certain curious fascination with achieving an altered state of consciousness. This began my journey into not only wanting to try most drugs, but ALL of the drugs because I thought that it would give me some enhanced perspective, or something naive like that.

Anyway, I first ran into hydros towards the middle of my freshman year in highschool, but I wouldn't be able to get hydros here and there on a regular basis (if I wanted them: I found that they helped me socialize, alleviated anxiety, turned me into the class pet, and also nullified the back pain that I had started to notice once in a while... more about this later.) I never became dependent on pills in school, despite having the resources to, I managed to get a grip on that.

For me, the real trouble started when I turned to taking kratom in heaping piles using the toss and wash method, the trouble wasn't the kratom however, it was the dosage. I was taking absurd amounts, dosing 4-5x a day just to fend off bone-chilling shivers towards the very end. At first, with any opioids, I had that same alleviation of anxiety and an energizing feeling of passion and attention to detail in things I would do in day to day life. I've been moderately dependent on some ""legally"" acquired hydromorphone (4-8mg rectal/day), morphine (75mg+/day), even hydrocodone and oxycodone. My kratom habit became horrendous by the very end of my sophomore year, so my pediatrician referred me to an addiction counselor who after trying to taper me off slowly, decided that it would be best to cold-turkey me. He had my pediatrician write me a script for 10 days of comfort meds: 1mg of Ativan 4x a day in someone who had never been prescribed benzos before. I felt as if I was being truly crucified for the first two days and hardly even had enough energy to eat, though the Ativan still didn't take away the restlessness in my arms or legs. Part of me began to wonder if I was simply returning to normal, or if something was wrong with me, as the pain in my shoulders and back came back full force.

Well, as healthcare in the US would have it, my pediatrician's next step was to refer my dumb ass to a psychiatrist who, after seeing me twice, started me on a healthy dose of Klonopin daily (as well as writing scripts for any stimulant I wanted, because I guess the narcolepsy I was having from her initial script for Ativan made me qualify for having ADD on her survey.) Unequivocally, starting daily Klonopin has been the single worst decision I've ever made in my life, but I digress. Still, despite having resolved my anxiety issue now by turning myself into an absurdly over-medicated freak, I was having this terrible back pain that I had noticed during my physical in my freshman year, but attributed to wearing a backpack that day.

I'll spare you my life story, but after seeing the same pediatrician almost weekly because of unbearable muscle and joint pain, I was told that it was just ""growing pains"" after having a whole blood test and X-rays done. At this point, I think a lot of people can relate, after hearing the same ""Oh you're just looking for pain pills"" thing from literally everyone: family, friends, doctors... you really start to believe it.

Fast forward to freshman year of college and I see a new primary care doc after I turn 18 who, after doing one test, refers me to a rheumatologist. She tells me that she didn't even have to see me to tell me what I had, the blood work and X-rays were telling enough. She diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis, a degenerative inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine (basically, the discs become damaged and then fuse the vertebrae together over time). Since being diagnosed, and still having flares of excruciating pain (despite being on a biologic that I have to stick myself with every week that costs my insurance company ~$5k/mo), my primary tells me that ""We don't want to start narcotics, because you always have to increase the dose"" or ""We don't want to start narcotics considering your age.""

I've never asked him for a narcotic, I've only repeated the truth: I'm fucking sick of taking 800mg of Advil 3 times a day with a Tylenol or two alongside it just to be able to leave my house. A huge part of dealing with chronic pain is acceptance, yes, but this guy won't even give me 10 Tylenol 3s... I'm at a fucking loss lol.

Sorry for rambling and shit, it's early but I cant sleep because it's raining and my neck feels ready to pop. I just want to hear about other people's experiences with similar things or recommendations as far as getting either the help I need or the help I think I need.

My mom was prescribed Fentanyl patches. It was summer time, and they made her sweat a lot. Cinnamon always love to giving kisses, she would lick everybody all over. She where to cling to my mom a lot and lick her extensively, but it was nothing out of the ordinary initially. But then she started acting weird. She would bolt over and start to attack my mom if she didn't let her lick the sweat off of her. She would start acting really funny, throw up, they really fussy and aggressive which was completely out of character for her. We realized that cinnamon had been licking the fent that was in my mom's sweat and got addicted to it. Homegirl was in fentanyl withdrawal. In retrospect that is hysterical that I saw my God damn cat get dope sick from being a little junkie fiend fent licjer.  My mom had to wean her off, let her lick little bits at a time for less and less cutting her down every few days.

Cinnamon ultimately recovered from her addiction. It was fucking hilarious when we realized what was happening. See, I'm totally predisposed... Even my goddamn cat was a junkie! Anyway, just wanted to share with you all this random memory that popped into my mind and made me giggle. ",1527917831.0

Her fingers outline the mirror, depiction of a monster

A portrayal not her own but made a reality by the ghosts that haunt her past

Inside she proves the only is constant is change

Her views of the world; crystal clear

A walking shell, skeleton of the life once held so dear

The beginning of the end; our suicide

Attempt at redemption; atleast know I tried

There is only so much one can take

Despite how long, she will not break

Her good judgement of character sodomized by the broomstick of society

Who teaches her to contradict everything she believes

""Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind""

She now assumes the portrait of a common fairy

Predicting death to all who cross her path

Thoughts of her own, the last of her kind

This dead flesh body will eventually decay

At last she'll be free on this dying day

These days are numbers as her soul fades away

Rekindle the flame of her burning desires

Like the kerosene lies that fuel lovers fires

The blackened lungs of a pathological liar

The attention whore with needs so dire

The track marked beauty queen who just wants to get higher

A bathtub littered with electrical wire

The lifeless corpse still waiting on it's pyre

Uncorrupted youth's eyes ceasing to tire

Like atheists serenading the sacred choir

Her breath dies out with the greatest of ease 

Smooth stained glass seas

Wind humming verses of the slightest breeze

Slowly combing the ancient primordial trees

She calmly falls to her knees

8nyaaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8nyaaz/story_about_stuff/,9,https://redd.it/8nyaaz,dopeandsmokes,Story about stuff,"Hey dudes. This isn’t related to opiates really.. but I love this community and this is a story I can’t really share with folks in my day to day life, you’ll see why If you keep reading... I’m stoned as hell on oxy’s right now... and this story is about  something that’s weighed heavily on me for years and honestly I just want to tell it to someone. 

When I was in my late teens early twenties I used to sell a lot of weed. Not just here and there.. I was obsessed w it - good at it to.  

My connection and I became very close over the years we were good friends. We accomplished a lot together. Until one day, and to this day I don’t have a good reason for doing this. I decided to screw this cat over. I lied to him and told him I was robbed of our stash and basically he was fucked out of a lot of money. 

Obviously he was devastated, and I stuck to the script and apologized and lied again and basically said I’d pay him back over time..,. Well, a few weeks later my house was raided by the cops looking for weed. I never figured out exactly why but I think it had something to w someone else who was sort of an enemy of mine/ competition at the time. 

After that I basically told the dude that ya, I’m out, I’m not gonna be doing this stuff anymore and ur SOL about the money. Sent him a pic of the warrant and never heard from the dude again. 

Also! Cops didn’t find shit I had just stolen tons of money why would I be selling weed?? Hah! They were late to the party. 

Anyways.. I’ve thought about my old connection/friend, literally every single day since the day I fucked him over. I’ve lost sleep over it, it was the heaviest guilt I ever carried about anything I truly felt horrible about it and the thing is.. I didn’t even have a good reason to rob him.. that’s what killed me. I did it for seriously no good reason. Which, I guess you guys will have to take my word for it on this one.. but it wasn’t a good representation of who I am as a person. I don’t do things like that. So it was something that weighed heavily in me for many years. 

Flash forward a few years. I haven’t sold a drug since the day I took the money. I’ve focused very much on my career.. and I fucking love opiates which lead me to this fantastic community. 

Last week I looked up my old friend. I reached out to him. I told him what had happened back in the day, and told him i wanted it make it right. He was... suspicious to say the least. But we did end up meeting, and I paid him back every single dollar plus some.. I don’t want to say the exact figure but it was 5 digits. 

It was an incredible moment for us both. We then reminisced over old times, and really enjoyed catching up. 

Right before we parted ways he asked what made me want to do this... the answer was that he was my friend, someone who never did anything to deserve what I did to him. And I didn’t want to carry the guilt w me anymore, and honestly because I didn’t want it out in the universe anymore. 

About a week has passed and I feel completely liberated. 


Sorry for the off topic post.. I just don’t have anyone else I can really share this w. And thought y’all might enjoy a wholesome story about some good o’l fashion game shit. 

Happy nods y’all!

But lately it's not an escape, it's just an invitation to deal with more bullshit that wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the dope. 
We've been together for a long time and we both have habits, and both of us have expressed interest in cleaning up and regaining our lives, or at least some semblance of normal lives. Had a chance at the first of the week, but just had to have another go around. 
But lately our 'escape ', our buzz, consists of me watching her nod out while sitting or standing,  and trying to keep her from hurting herself, or burning or breaking something. But in her eyes, I'm not doing that. Instead I'm hovering over her and bitching. And when she's in this shape it's obviously the perfect time to go wandering around outside or thru the building. We're essentially squatting at night, so lights and noises have to be kept to bare minimum,  absolute necessity. Unless you're on the nod, can't walk or maintain a grip on anything,  so you're constantly dropping everything, sounds like an excellent opportunity to explore doesn't it ? But other than that, you're good, why not go wandering around, except for the part where we have absolutely nowhere left to go. 

So yeah, that's what evidently is passing for a buzz and a good time right now. And we're paying thru the nose for the experience (No pun intended). Anybody else going thru that, or been thru it already? Sorry for the rant but it's killing us and had to let go of it. ",1527910469.0

It took me a minute before I realized my cats had the itch like crazy, and we've all been there just itchy all over and wanting nothing more then to scratch it, only she couldnt scratch it because of her bandages. I can only imagine how terrible it would be to be on opiates and not be able to itch.

I decided to take a whole pill a few days later, but felt the exact same thing as the first time, except even more of a bad mood and more itching. For $30 a pop I determined that these things are definitely not worth it and ended up selling the rest. I guess it's a blessing in disguise because I have heard how addictive these things can be.

Used to lurk here a lot and post from time to time.

I got on subs Febuary last year, after a few attempts at getting on them and falling off the wagon. I started at 4mg and have very slowly reduced to the 0.8mg a day I'm taking now.

So being the incurable dickhead that I am I've been messing around with my daily dose. I quite often snort my dose. Once a week, but sometimes more often. Recently I've been craving stronger opiates, and I can't help but wonder if the buprenorphine has become something of an addiction in itself.

Buprenorphine has helped me tremendously and I'm 100% not against maintenance. But in truth I was in such a bad way when I hit my bottom when I was using that going cold turkey was not something I seriously considered. I was so depressed I was nearly suicidal so I figured it'd be best to get on subs and sort my life out. Slowly that has happened. I started taking an anti-depressant recently, and it's the first one I've tried that actually helps without causing me to feel it helps too much or has horrible side effects. Since then I've made strides towards getting my life back on track. I'm not quite there but I'm in better shape than I have been since before I even started using, so 5/6 years.

I'm not sure if it'd be best to stop taking the buprenorphine and go cold turkey to try to get over my need to take opiates to feel ok. Maybe I'm at such a low dose it's natural for my body to crave opiates somewhat.

My keyworker said that it's up to me, and if I did want to jump off the doctor could prescribe something to help with the withdrawal symptoms (I'm guessing something like Clonidine and maybe something to help me sleep?). I'm hesitant to mention that I've been abusing the buprenorphine I'm prescribed, I'm not sure if I'd get in trouble and have my support withdrawn. The past 4 months or so I've made numerous attempts to take less than the dose I'm prescribed and all of my attempts end at day 3 or 4 at the max. It's not even that the withdrawals are that bad but just having the buprenorphine there it's too tempting to just snort some for that measly but real ""high"". It's stupid.

Any advice? Has anyone here jumped from the 0.8mg/1mg range before? How was it? Anyone from the UK had much experience with CGL (https://www.changegrowlive.org (not sure if links are allowed but will delete if not))? I'm not sure if I should be honest with my keyworker about how I've been feeling and acting with the subs.

If I'm honest I want to be off them so I'm leaning towards stopping, even if the idea of living without any opiates for the first time in years is scary. But would be good to hear some opinions.

This shed has a bunch of cameras on every corner outside hooked up to a TV inside and my buddy saw him walking down the alley.  Well, this guy had owed my buddy $180 for over a week now and has been ducking and dodging him and buying dope a few streets down instead of going to him and squaring up.

My buddy instantly jumps up and runs outside to chase him down.  When he catches up to him he's all, like, ""YOU GOT MY MONEY??!"" and the guy was obviously high as fuck.

What happened next was so savage it blew my mind.  Two enforcers that stay up at the trap hold this guy down while my homeboy walks back to the shed and emerges about a minute later with a syringe and a vial of Narcan.

He draws up a big dose of it into the rig and injects this guy with a huge shot of Narcan which almost immediately sent him into severe precipitated withdrawals (this guy was so high, he was nodding while walking, looked like the walking dead).

The guy starts dry heaving and yelling and then began to puke.  Then the two big black enforcer guys begin beating the shit out of this dude and knock him out.

One guy punched him so hard he was unconscious before he hit the ground.

That's some crazy shit, injecting someone with Narcan to send them into withdrawals because of a debt.  It's dangerous out here on these streets.
