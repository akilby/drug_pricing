It took me a full year working with a PCP, physical therapy, orthopedic spine specialist, spinal neurologist, and all the xrays, MRIs, and CTs they put me through. This went on for just over a year before I was referred do PM so I know what it's like to need opiates for pain relief and to do what it takes to get them today.

 Aside from the social stigma, There was so much about her DAILY struggle and routine that made her feel completely alone and ostracized. As can be expected, I've been thinking about her a lot in the past few days. I guess my question is: what about your own story--and I mean anything-- with opis would make you feel less lonely and alienated if you saw it reflected back in someone else's story?  
Life is brutal and fucked up for no reason sometimes. And your struggle isn't the ""scum bag, low-life"" bull shit it's marketed as. ",1510929361.0

Post an ad on casual encounters and say you're a woman looking for a man (w4m) because a guy most likely isn't going to help another guy get their hands on anything. In your post simply say that you ""need H elp finding some party favors etc...."" Just use that as a base and type whatever else you think might work. Within 5 min I had over 15 people emailing me trying to help. The first thing I replied is ""sorry but im actually a guy but do you think you could still help?"" A lot of them didn't even reply after that because they were just trying to use the desperation of people to get laid but there's always that solid reply that looks promising. Work a little magic and make people trust you and eventually one of those people replying will come through. I met a really cool and normal ass white dude with all the goodies 5 min down the road at a Whataburger and was on the way home within a few minutes. I wouldn't even attempt finding someone posting about selling something because 99% of those are just bad news. I've been trying to score on CL for a week now by trying to find ads posted by other people but none of that shit ever worked and its sketchy. Just post an ad yourself and hopefully something will come through. But don't be dumb, use your street smarts and don't do anything that may contain a red flag. Good luck out there!

First five years i managed wihout opiates but then a second injury made me turn to opiates to help. Heroin worked, but when fentanyl came around got too dangerous. I also got infections and health problems from unclean street shit. 

I have mental problems, not interested in anti depressants. Not long ago i got ahold of not even a dozen dilaudid pills, a bunch of kratom, and some liquid methadone. I would switch between maintaining on methadone and kratom and once a week when my pain got real bad, shoot a dilly. Would micron filter it and everything. But ive run out. The kratom and methadone keep me well, i take such a tiny amount, 6mg of methadone or like 15g of kratom a day. But the dillies were the best. Theyd wash away my intense sadness.... let me relax and feel less pain for a few hours.

Now im conaidering buying dnm heroin and micron filters and shooting that instead of dillies which i cant get. Im afraid of weird diseases and viruses that even a sterile micron cant filter out. Im paranoid some ISIS al queada taliban fuck is gonna chemical weaponize the junk, theres case reports of people in Vancouver getting strange brain infections from dope in the 2000s. Theres also been a case where they had cut it with bone meal and it gave junkies mad cow. 


I can try to see a pain specialist for some pharma shit... its probabaly unlikely ill get fuck all because i tried to get treatment for addiction awhile back, ots on my public record.so im fucked, im considering travelling overseas to a more liberal doctor if one exists. 

I dunno, any suggestions or anything? I cant see myself wanting to live life without a regular release that a strong fast acting opiate gives me. Its just too painful. Ive suffered alot. I wat to cry and scream sometimes because i feel like nobody will help me. 

Back to heroin? My source is good, its uncut and as pure as can be. I just hate the idea of putting non pharma drugs inside me.... i will probably order it and a milligram scale and try my best to keep it under control. We all know how that goes.

I also got extremely lucky that there was no fent in the dope cause this area is notorious for it. While we were waiting on the plug the dudes let me smoke some crack with them. I had never smoked crack before but it was definitely an experience lol. I can see why people fiend for that shit. Just wasnt for me.

Basically I was walking down to this gas station right by where i work to get a pack of cigs and some snacks. I saw this homeless dude who i see pretty often while walking to work and usually help him out with a cig or some change. He came asking for 1.25 for some beer. I was like you know where the dope is at? ""what you need"" etc etc. I told him and i offered to buy him $10 worth of crack as requested. Luckily his plug delivered so after getting some cash at CVS we chilled in a Pollo Tropical parking lot smoking crack and ripping cigs. The guy pulled up in about 20min which was wayy faster than expected. Everything went super smooth and a did a test bump of both bags and was very pleased. 

I was quite surprised at how well it worked out but i know im very lucky as a lot of shit can happen when cold copping. I was wondering if anyone had some good cold copping stories.",1510892923.0

Some taste like baking soda, some taste like cornstarch and some taste extremly bitter. 

I recently discovered the inactive ingredient section on drugs.com and I noticed this...

""Disintegrants facilitate the breakup of a tablet in the intestinal tract after oral administration. Cross-linking allows enhanced bioavailability of the drug through superior drug dissolution. Without a disintegrant, tablets may not dissolve appropriately and may effect the amount of active ingredient absorbed, thereby decreasing effectiveness.""

It's crazy to think that. 
But in this last year things have admittedly gotten worse once I ""graduated"" to dope. 
In fact.. FUCK this year. It's been one hell of a rollercoaster. 
But aside from my crippling mind state and chaotic home life, there's been one positive despite this all:
My career. 

It's strange to think that huh? 
How does a junkie keep excelling within their career path while descending into the darkness? 
Well..

I'm a cake decorator. 
I have a cool ass job and I'm good at it. I've never excelled so fast at something in my entire life 
(Peep my history if you want to see pics) 
All the negative shit in my life, this skill...this talent..
It keeps me going man. 

I'm a pastry chef and have been doing cakes for 5 years now.
Drawing and art is my specialty. It's the one GOOD gene my parents passed on 
(Makes up for all the other issues I get from them!)
And I find that I can channel the creativity through my cake decorating. 

In the last year alone I've gotten a vast raise, developed a name for myself and I'm now getting moved to a position in which I'll be working on the companies wedding cakes which is something I've DREAMT of. (We do cakes for some pretty big venues in the city I live in) 
Basically, it's a big deal and I developed pride in this 
(*hey I'm allowed to brag about this considering it's the only good thing I got going*) 
The bakery I work for is family owned and I feel as though I'm truly accepted as one of the kin. 
This place is more of a family to me then my actual family. 

This job is everything to me. It really is. 
And let me tell you, this industry..the culinary/restaurant/bakery industry is HARD af to manage working when your in active addiction, specifically when your withdrawing
(*the worst!!*)
There's been many times where I've thought I was so close to loosing this because I'm so heavily addicted to this damn substance and I can't function without it. 

So that being said..
My appreciation for this job and my work is becoming so important it's making sobriety more appealing each and every day. 
I can only imagine how much better I could be if I didn't have this monkey on my back.
I want to get clean and really focus on my talent, especially before heroin destroys my love for this 
(Literally one of my biggest fears...all my other hobbies are squashed) 
So like what the fuck am I waiting for?? 

Eh..it's just such a weird parallel ya know? 

That's all.

On our path to no end

Theres some ups and downs

The occasional bend

Undoubtably though, we shall further descend

I looked at my palm, it was empty today

My lover has gone, she has sent me away

I look at the gun, though tempt me it may,

I’d rather battle the demons, that led me astray

My mission being harm reduction. I couldn't hide any more that I had switched from snorting to experimenting with shooting (for about a month).  My girl, somewhat understanding, I would share some H with her very occasion (helped her with that womanly monthly cramping).

Asked the pharmacist about Narcan.  He seemed confused and just didn't know the procedures to selling Narcan OTC. (The sheer lack of knowledge about this harm reduction to the lead pharmacy tech just shows how neglected addicts are on this side..) So, 10 minutes and several pages of reading, and 2 phone calls later he comes back with 2 small off-orange boxes, then proceeded to let me know that I had to buy 2 of them at a time, and sign some paperwork.  Each of them 2mg so 4mg total.  I'm wanting to keep one for emergencies.  Obviously...

Being how wonderful this community is, and how y'all have been there for me, I'm willing to ship this IV dose of Narcan to whomever needs it most...

in the beginning the drugs are great, they make life better-- but then after some time the negatives start to out-weight the positives...

ive been clean of all opiods (including kratom maintence) for about 2 weeks now, and had my 'final hit' yesterday-- the warm rush was nice sure, but the rest of the day spent unconscious and vomitting... i started drugs because i felt i was hardly living-- couped up in my room with little sources of pleasure/excitement/contentment.

now i realize opiates are the opposite of living, the escapism is seductive for sure-- but they dont make life better; they partially remove you from it; at least for a little while. Then the return to earth is a living hell, with every physical or emotional feeling like a kick in the teeth...

i think im done with this viscous cycle of one foot in one foot out of heroin addiction. part of me is very controlling and my runs never go on for more than a few months before i detox and start up again... its probably the most damaging usage pattern i can think of-- no stability whatsoever...

im ready to move on, after yesterdays binge i decided life has more to offer. Wish me well guys-- 'choose life' xD 

i plan on getting through the days on aderall, and some weed/hash in the evenings with valium used sparingly (for example i tapered off them over 10 days when i last quit, but just took one now as the anxiety of the thought of withdrawals returning was killing me-- fortunately i have 0 symptoms, 1 day didnt seem enough to set me back)",1510855930.0

I’m visiting a sick family member, so I’m away without my supplier for two weeks and I just ran out of what I brought with me.  11 days to go...

I have a few 30mg Morphine ER, but not enough and I’d like to just go ahead and face the detox anyway.

I have: 
weed
Xanax/Valium
Kratom (28 red maeng capsules, but I can order more)
Imodium 

and I already have some things from the Thomas Recipe: L-Tyrosine, multivitamins, vitamin B6, access to jacuzzi/hot bath, bananas. 

I’m about to do my last run to the grocery store (I’m in a small town, so limited resources) and going to get a lot of water, Pedilyte, ginger chews, dark chocolate…

I was basically going to try a combination of the Thomas Recipe and Kratom to combat the withdrawals.  Does that sound like a good plan?  

I can lay low for 5-6 days.

I’ve only detoxed once before - cold turkey, and it was such an awful experience so I really want to avoid as much of the awfulness as possible. The main reason I’ve still been on Oxy is because that detox was so rough.",1510853961.0

I’d appreciate any feedback you can give. I work for a city government parks dept. We have an issue where the restrooms at one of our pools has become a homeless person magnet. The pool is open all year, does not charge an entry fee, and has individual rooms where you can lock yourself in and shower/get cleaned up. In hindsight, this was a bad idea. Homeless people frequently use these rooms as a place to shoot up, have sex, and smear shit all over the walls. One dude goes so far as to take the liner out of the trash can then shit in the trash can. I guess to make it more of a hassle for the staff cleaning it up. The lifeguards frequently find needles stuffed in the drains or hidden under the sink. This pool is also 100 feet from an elementary school. 

My questions are:

1.  What do you think would be the effect of installing sharps disposal containers in these rooms?  Will that signal we are cool with what’s going on and result in more people showing up to shoot up/blast shit on the walls?  

2. Does anyone have a suggestion for how to reduce the frequency of this undesirable behavior?  We’re about to just lock up the restrooms for good and make everyone use the other restrooms on site, which don’t provide any privacy/door locks. More of a locker room type situation. 

Anyway, happy nods and I’d appreciate any thoughts on this subject.

My friends DOC is speedballing cocaine and heroin intravenously, and while he's generally well educated on harm reduction methods, I was very concerned with how ignorant he was on this particular subject. You can't protect yourself from the many dangers associated with (especially intravenous) hard drug use if you don't know what the specific dangers actually are, after all. I already know the general public, as is typical, is incredibly ignorant when it comes to the dangers/risks of these drugs, but if there are any users on this thread like my friend, as I suspect there are, I hope this brings clarity to the issue and allows for continued use for as long and safe as possible.

The biggest misconception I always hear is that because cocaine is a stimulant and because heroin is a depressant, the mixed signals that are sent to your system/heart are confusing and place significant strain on the organs causing them to work much harder than normal. In actuality, as far as the heart is concerned, having a depressant helps balance the effects of the cocaine and minimize the stress caused by a rapid heart rate. Coke can cause the heart to beat way faster than is healthy, especially in higher doses, often exceeding 200 bpm. When used with heroin, a person's bpm will be much less extreme, minimizing the negative impacts on health while also lowering the chances of an OD. On the flip side, cocaine has a similar relationship in regards to heroin and it's effects on the system; a person is much less likely to OD on heroin while the effects of cocaine are still active.

Ironically, the characteristics that can have positive impacts on safety are the same that make this combination so inherently dangerous. The juxtaposition of effects these drugs have allow for, and often promote, unusually high dosages of each. In particular, cocaine allows one to ingest much more heroin than they would normally. In a situation where only heroin is ingested, depending on an individual's opioid tolerance, there is a point at which the heroin will cause the user to ""nod out"", preventing further use (even if so desired). When cocaine is also ingested, it allows the user to go well beyond this dose, however. Over the course of many hours it's not uncommon for someone to have ingested 2 or even 3 times that of their normal dose of heroin.

Problems arise when the effects of the cocaine begin to wear off. Heroin can last anywhere from 3 - 6 hours while cocaine will typically last only about 45 minutes, rarely exceeding an hour. As the stimulating effects from the cocaine wear off, the effects of the heroin remain undiminished and will persist for a significant amount of time. If the amount of heroin in one's system is at lethal levels when this occurs, an OD is imminent. Luckily, this occurs gradually giving the individual some time to react, however, the cessation of effects is rapid. This is the case for the majority of OD's attributed to the combination of cocaine and heroin.

It is also possible, although less frequent/likely, for the same scenario to occur only with cocaine as the primary cause of the OD. Heroin allows one to tolerate much higher doses of cocaine, and although it helps minimize the stress placed on the heart, exceptionally large doses of cocaine are still going to cause damage and will eventually lead to an OD regardless.

I hope this helps some of you to better moderate your dosing when it comes to speedballing. It can be hard to tell where you're at in regards to your heroin dose while in the middle of this combination. Periodically allowing the effects of the cocaine to completely subside before redosing will help in measuring the safety of your heroin dose.

Cheers! May your nods be safe and plentiful.",1511014417.0

I would like to send out some care packages to a few people who genuinely do not have access to clean supplies for whatever reason. I really want them to go to those who truly cannot get to an exchange or buy online, so please keep that in mind when commenting.

I would like to send out 20 packs to 20 different people. Unless you have a specific request for your pack, each pack will contain:

- 1 10-count package of syringes (choose from 29g/0.5""/1cc or 31g/0.25""/0.3cc)
- 10 alcohol prep pads
- 5 cookers
- 2 tourniquets
- 1 package pre-rolled cottons
- 1 lighter
- 1 fun size package of SPK

If you need any of these supplies minus the syringes, let me know. I can send out as many of those as I want. The only item that is limited are the rigs. I have two boxes of those, hence the 20 packs. I cannot send out Narcan at this time, but I'm working on how I can do that. 

These care packages are absolutely 100% free, no exchange of funds required, but I would obviously need your address to send you one, so you must be okay with that. I will choose the 20 recipients on a first come-first serve basis, but keeping in mind those with a genuine NEED will be first on the list. Packs will ship out before Thanksgiving via USPS in plain, unmarked mailers. **NOTE: At this time, I can only send care packages within the continental United States. I sincerely apologize and hope to have international packs available soon.** Comment below or inbox me if you would like to be added to the list! Be safe out there, fam!

UPDATE 1:30 PM, 11/18 : I've gotten a LOT of responses already! I will be going through comments and messages later today and begin making a list. I will inbox everyone to get their address and preferences for their packs as well as letting you know you will for sure be receiving one.

UPDATE 1:19 AM, 11/19: **As of right now, I have one (1) spot left on my list for someone who NEEDS a care pack!** I have made a secondary list for those of you requesting packs without rigs. This list has unlimited spots. I will be sending a message to every single one of you to confirm your address, special requests and letting you know that you will have a pack coming your way.

Anyway, when we met up (At TBK 😂😂), she told me that it was “Rose Crystal” LSD, again, 200 micrograms per tab, and she did 2 tabs for $14. So, I leave the restaurant which was 13 minutes from my house, and as I’m 3 minutes away from the restaurant, I take one. 

I get home which was about 7 minutes after I first put it under my tongue, and I was absolutely smashed off the raw (H, that is), so my pupils were pinpoint. But the second I got into my house, I KNEW I was feeling it, even though, again, my pupils were still pinpoint.  But I knew from allll my past experiences that it takes at least an hour and 20 minutes for it to *start* kicking in. Again, at least w/ my experience. 

So, I get in the house and my friend and I are just chilling, but he doesn’t talk much so both of us were just sitting listening to Led Zeppelin. 45 mins after I put the tab under my tongue, dude had left, I put music on on my tv, was listening to Patsy Cline, and I was GONEEEEEE! Gone meaning Tripping. Fucking. Bawls. Was gr8. 

Then I went on my computer and started playing Left 4 Dead, highly doubt y’all know what that is but if you do I love you 😘.  I had never played L4D tripping, but it was fun as fuck and confusing as fuck and fun. Cause I was playin with a friend or two. 

In conclusion, I was tripping fucking balls. I was able to grab 2 yellow busses and a fat .7 for $20 altogether earlier. Overall, I’m happy because I’ll be able to take that second tab tomorrow 🔥🔥🔥🔥
 
(Technically today) 

Oh, also, I’m happy because my friend came over and he gets xans and Ativan prescribes, so he hooked me up with abouttt 3 or 4 of each? Not junkie Jesus, but... 

What would y’all call Benzo Jesus? 

A QUESTION: Should I take the acid tomorrow during the day and save the xans for when I’m trying to come down and sleep? Or should I take them w/ the ‘cid? How do y’all think that would play out? 


TL;DR : I got the opportunity to grab 2 200 microgram tabs of “Rose Crystal” LSD, yesterday, and God was it fucking fire.  Also, got some “xans”.

Constipation is one of the most common problems good ol’ opiate addicts face and if you’re like me you have tried just about everything to solve it. 

Whether it was swallowing some pills or some mysterious promising powder, all the way to sticking something or somethings up your butt hoping to finally have that empty colon feeling once again I promise you I’ve been there. It wasn’t until one time where I didn’t go for 2 weeks that I said enough is enough there has to be a better way!


Now before I share the secret I must warn you this should be used a last resort or for people like myself who are using enough opiates everyday to bring down a herd of elephants!


What you will need:
Naloxone (Narcan) 
Stool softeners
Fiber gummies
A nasal squirt bottle that can be filled
Some kind of Stimulant I use adderall(optional)
A GOOD AMOUNT OF YOUR FAVORITE OPIATE PREPARED TO BE IMMEDIATELY SNORTED OR INJECTED
Somewhere with a toilet that you can flush many times without being bothered for atleast 20-30 minutes. 



Since you are tranquilizing that elephant in your head everyday(opiate agonist receptors) or so you are also tranquilizing the receptors in your colon that tells your body you need to poop and also gets your colon moving and the stuff inside. 

Now we are going to reverse this process and give it a little push. 

Step 1:
Take 2 of your stool softener of choice(sold for very cheap otc at any pharmacy) 12-24 hours before you decide to go through with this complete bowel clearance. 

Eat 4(chew thoroughly) fiber gummies 12-24 hours before the emptying as well. 

Step 2:

Fill your nasal squirt bottle with about 20-30ml of water depending upon how big the bottle is so that it is about half way filled. 

Step 3:

Take your Naloxone(for me I get the 4mg nasal one shot spray version but any kind will work) and shoot, pray, or pour it into your designated nasal spray bottle(usually some kind of glass vial with a squirter head on top). Try to only put 4 mg. 

Now you should have about 4mg of Narcan diluted in 20-30 ml of water. 

Step 4(optional):
 
1-30 minutes before you want to go poop depending on stimulant used and method of use. Just make sure it is kicking in at the same time as STEP 5. Take your stimulant of choice. 

This is optional as Step 5 should make the average person empty just fine but for heavy users like myself this step is needed. 


Step 5 :

This is the most important and careful step. 

10-15 minutes before you are going to empty squirt about 5-20 squirts of your naloxone water mix into each nostril. The amount used it dependent upon multiple factors such as how much opiates you have in your body at the time or how sick or not sick you are currently. Basically you are going to make yourself just sick enough to get your bowels moving for long enough to have a great poop. But don’t worry you are going to be well immediately after with step 7. 

Step 6 THE POOP:

Once the naloxone( and stimulant if used) are kicking in, your stomach should be kicking begging you to go at this time. Get on the porcelain throne! I recommend a poop stool, and stool will work to prop your feet up on it really helps.  

Then just give it your best push, my best tip is when something is coming out don’t stop pushing until it stops because that is your best opportunity to get as much out as possible. 

Don’t get up yet though flush what you did and wait because there will be more! Usually for me it’s all out in 2-3 drops. 

Step 7 THE REBOUND:

Now then you are probably feeling pretty horrible at this point if you did this right because of the Naloxone and if you’re like me praying for death but do not worry ! Soon you will be back to your good old junkie self. 

Once you feel that you have sufficiently emptied your bowels grab the opiate you have prepared hopefully somewhere right next to you and use it! You might need about 50% more than you normally do to get well to completely negate the narcan. I use H snorted and 2 decent sized lines has me feeling back to normal within 5-10 minutes if you shoot you will probably be better even faster. Obviously take care not to do too much no ODING!

Step 8:

Sit on your porcelain throne until you feel good enough to get up and admire your flat tummy and empty feeling colon. 


BONUS IMPORTANT THINGS/TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND:

1. There is no exact amount of narcan or stim. So the first time you do this take it slow just use maybe 5 squirts in each nostril and wait to see how it affects you. Also just try the normal amount of stim you would do don’t take it overboard until you see how this all effects you. 

2. There is no exact amount of opiates needed to rebound for everyone. Usually you are gonna need a bit more than you usually use but don’t go overboard if you are not feeling better in 5-10 minutes use more and then again in 5-10 if still not ok. At worst you will be normal in an hour. 

3. DO NOT TRY THIS WITHOUT A GOOD AMOUNT OF OPIATES AT THE READY YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL TERRIBLE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE IT. 

4. If you sniff your opiates immediately put your tray or whatever it’s on down because you most likely are going to start sneezing because your nostrils are extra sensitive just like the bowels you just emptied. 

5. Flush after each drop/wipe because as the sickness kicks in the last thing you want is a flooded toilet. 

6. Usually I recommend doing this method no sooner than 3 days apart because you want to build up as much poop in your colon as possible to empty it effectively(the more that’s in there the easier it is to go trust me). 

7. This is an advanced technique don’t do it the first time but if you feel you’re not completely emptying with the pre stim and narcan right before you sit down to drop use 1/3 of the amount of pre stims u used. Again I use adderall. So that by the time you are nearing the end it kicks your stomach one last time to get it all out. 

8. Keep a towel near by you are going to have a little bit of a runny nose and might be sweating. 

Good luck my fellow junkies make the force be in your colon. 

Let me know if you think I missed anything or should change anything this was done on mobile after an adderall induced great shit so I will check it on my computer later.

My regular dealer in Brooklyn was from DC- when I told him about the trip, he hooked me up with two of his friends in “The Game”, Frankie and ‘T’. Both responded immediately when I texted a week in advance, and I touched down at AIRPORT late Sunday evening feeling like my ass was covered. 

‘T’ had stopped responding, so I set up a meeting with Frankie near my hotel early the following morning. He never showed... Good to know that dboys are the same, no matter what city. 

**8:30AM**
I didn’t have time to screw around- the first meeting started in 30 minutes, so I decided to cut my losses and pick up Al from the hotel. Maybe they’d get back to me in a few hours, I hoped.

**1:00PM**
Al and I walked out of the developer’s lobby after a morning of fairly dry, but successful presentations. Al was psyched, it seemed like we had gotten the project. But my head was somewhere else.
No good news on my phone- I had even trolled Craigslist in between meetings and not even those scam artists were replying. *Nothing*. 

I dropped Al off at the hotel and parked near the Mall, thinking I’d grab something to eat and solve this rapidly growing disaster.

The dboy wasn’t responding, nobody on Craigslist, just *nothing*. Brooklyn hookup said he couldn’t help. My phone had 1% battery- we both needed a plug, badly.

**1:30 PM**
Like a Christmas present full of dogshit, I had wrapped my junkie body in a suit that morning. People see what they want to see, what they need to see, and passersby did their best to help the sad young man dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief.

“Um... Sir?” A middle-aged woman in a pantsuit tried to get my attention, walked over with mock-concern and a nasal twang:
“Sir, do you need help? Maybe directions?”

*Yes, please die immediately*, I wanted to say. This woman was wasting my precious time- I needed to scour this city for heroin and it would get drastically harder as night fell.

She probably had a half-full bottle of Norcos in the bathroom cabinet from knee surgery two years ago. They made her feel dizzy, she probably said and a few Motrin always did the trick.

“Sir?” She wasn’t going away.

I shook my head, pushing away daydreams about this busybody’s imaginary Vicodin stash. It would take the whole bottle to soothe this headache.

“Um,” I mumbled, benign-but-confused look on my face, “where is the Lincoln Memorial? I want to go... Pay my respects...”

Well, that sounded stupid, but I could hardly think. A nice, obvious tourist question. Now she could point me in the right direction and go home, smugly satisfied with herself. And I could get the fuck away.

The Memorial? I knew where it was, about a 3 minute walk- my car was parked nearby. The plan was: drive away, charge my phone and regroup.

Sue (let’s call her Sue) was pleased. What a poor soul, lost in the nation’s capital! How lucky, to run into such a helpful, selfless woman! 

She swiveled and pointed, the nascent traces of another question started to spill from her mouth. 

But I was already gone, speed-walking toward the Lincoln Memorial. 

*Fucking Sue*, I thought, pulling at my tie knot.

**2:20 PM**
Heroin was urgently yanking my leash as I approached Abe’s shadow. A herd of cattle was mulling about aimlessly, disguised as people- but I knew better. *People aren’t shaped like that*, pointlessly reassuring myself, knowing the truth would only make this sickness worse.

**2:32 PM**
DC was a wash- the 40 miles to Baltimore would be cake in my bitchin’ Chrysler Sebring, courtesy of Hertz. I’d never been to Baltimore, but knew it would be easier to cop there. Tripadvisor for Junkies, why isn’t that a thing? I guess nobody would pay for it.

Crowds still stood between me and my rental. Scowling, I blearily scanned the area for an easy exit- suddenly making eye contact with a security guard. The ill-fitting black suit was tastefully accessorized with a dangling earpiece, and humorless expressio... He was probably bored out of his skull. I meekly looked away and moved around the herd’s perimeter. 

Oh, *fuck.* Two more guards were putting up barriers between the columns at the monument’s entrance. Another seemed to be pushing the crowd back, away from the road that separated me from my rental. Not good. What the fuck was going on?
The more I looked, the more earpieces I noticed. Barriers. Secret Service? Why?

**2:42 PM**
My dark suit jacket concealed a shirt soaked through with sweat. The path behind me was already blocked. If I didn’t move quickly, I could be stuck here for hours as these bovine masses showed each other pictures of their grandchildren. That couldn’t happen. Not now, not today. 

I walked purposefully toward the Lincoln Memorial’s top steps- the crowd thinned out up here and I didn’t see any barriers. A group behind me had their phones drawn, happily taking pictures with expressionless captors. Yep, definitely Secret Service and they had their hands full. 

Was there a terrorist threat? Did they think someone was smuggling a pipe bomb in their fanny pack?

Any concern for national security paled in comparison to how badly I needed heroin in that moment. So I made my move, slipping behind a column, and waited for some armed patriot to knock me out.

**2:57 PM**
Nobody came. The din outside faded as I crept deeper into the dark Lincoln Memorial, nose dripping and eyes fully dilated, streaming tears. Looking for an exit, some kind of back door. I’d sprint to my car, never return to DC. Fuck my job, fuck this business trip... This was beyond what I could handle, I thought, standing behind Honest Abe’s massive stone chair.

**3:00 PM**
But then I saw him. Standing serenely with his eyes closed, lips gently moving.

President Barack Obama. *Shit.* No security detail. Alone with a dope fiend inside a legendary monument. 
I was overcome with fear. *What the fuck do I do?*

Then his eyes snapped open. “You’re not supposed to be here.” He murmured gently, seemingly at ease. I shook my head, *no*, totally overcome with fear.
Barack smiled. “Relax. You’re safe. What’s your name, kid?”

I told him and he repeated it slowly, extending his hand, “I’m Barack,” the president said, “nice to meet you...” he trailed off, staring into my eyes with concern. “... hey, are you alright?”

“N-not really, sir,” I was at my wits end. “No. I was trapped out there. I can’t get to my car, I’m sick and need my medicine.” Medicine, yeah right.

“You don’t look so great, kid,” Barack stepped closer, “when was your last fix?”

My jaw fucking dropped. I did what any of us would do: stand there, fully catatonic.

“Not good, my friend.” He grinned, shaking his head. “I always tell folks, always stay a step ahead, because that plug will always fail you one day.”

Now hang on a *fucking minute*. Barack Obama is a *junky?* No. No way, it wasn’t possible.

I shivered and nodded weakly.

Without breaking eye contact, Barack felt around in his suit pocket and raised his eyebrows. “Well, how much you got on you?” 

Was he serious? “$200... But. Well. Um.” I looked at the ground. 

“Forget it. Take this- I’m assuming you pay your taxes,” said the President of the United States, handing me a bundle, “and this doesn’t leave the Lincoln Memorial. Michelle would kill me if she knew.” ",1510996189.0

I have taken Ibuprofen and Tylenol tonight with no relief whatsoever. My question is if I take a Percocet or 2, will it be completely ineffective since I'm on the Suboxone? Last time I had my 4mg dose was about 13 hours ago. I don't want to waste them or fuck things up somehow. I'm just absolutely miserable at the moment and I don't know what to do.

40-50mg: Slightly strong-strong buzz. Typing gets hard. Memory starts to falter. Sometimes a bit nauseous. Can and will eat anything. Inhibitions are relatively gone. The itch starts. And doesn't fucking stop for ages.

I have not taken an opiate in one year and a few months.

First prescribed ops when I was approx 11 years old.   Dealing with increasing physical and mental pain, I began to take more and more as I grew physically.

All throughout my life from 11-22 or so I was taking them, averaging a few times a week.  Sometimes more, at some times less.  Starting with 5s at a young age, eventually getting into over 100mgs.  


So it is now, over a year without them.  I have tried many many things working with my therapist(s), and recently my Dr brought up the concept of suboxone.

  While some medications may have helped for a week or so, I was/am constantly met with the emptiness feeling - BUT not an emptiness of activity or purposef, I have a good job, a fair amount of friends, and in the ""reality"" world I am doing well - I mean emptiness in the sense that I really just miss the feeling the ops gave me, not necessarily the ""high"", just the overall mental feelings of... feeling right, almost like my brain ""needs"" just a little bit to function. This part is hard to describe as I am aware that this could simply just be the demon that is opiates trying to confuse my brain. 

 HOWEVER, due to the very early age of beginning the ops I have been questioning if this ""emptiness"" is in fact a neurological ""necessity"" of some sort of opiate.  Hence my questioning of suboxone.


I wish I could just forget the feeling, but it is too
o late for that.

You guys told me I should quit while I'm not too far into the wabbit whole. So I'm making this post to let you guys know how my life is going since then. In my post I said I don't get paid till next week but I had a few dollars laying around to spare, and I also got $20 for fixing my buddies pc. So I figured I'd go and grab a half and have a nice weekend. 

So how am I now? Well, I'm currently high, and feeling great. Dope is still number 3 on my list of favorite things, I'm, not completely addicted yet (Like I don't get cravings when I don't have it and I'm not getting sick. But If I have a bunch in front of me then I'll totally do it), and my life hasn't spiraled out of control in the almost year long period that I've been doing dope. Now I know what y'all are about to type, ""It'll get you eventually cough syrup druid"" or ""Quit now"" or ""You're a fucking retard and/or homooosapien. and you're probably right, but I plan on quitting opiates for good right before the new year as starting early next year I'll have to give it up to pursue life/career goals anyway, but I'm enjoying myself for now. The way I use I don't go into withdrawal, and I haven't had issues with prioritizing other monetary responsibilities over dope (or other opiates since I first started many moons ago). Also I only go through an acquaintance of mine who is a middle and I don't have any dealers numbers, among a few other precautions to help me not go overboard. 

Also ODB, and some other gentle sir/lady made a remind post for 1 year from now and I will be giving an update then. So if I do get addicted I'll let you guys know. Peace love over and out.

Can I get insurance without all of my ID's and such in order? I suppose there is one way to find out. Perhaps I shall this weekend as I am reaching wit's end. It has been argued that I am a tool and in all fairness my actions do jive with that assessment. Some weeks things go well and I get what I am owed. Other weeks I lay out money and get utterly screwed with nothing to show for it but a story. Some folks enjoy these stories, others get sick of them but oviously read them anyway because they complain about having ""wasted all this time reading.""


**To all of the naysayers:** if you don't like my posts, don't read them. If you feel they're not relatable to this community... go complain to a mod and tell them to revoke my posting priveleges. 

(apologies to mods if some morons inundante your inboxes requesting an end to my right to engage in discourse 'round these parts.)


**BTW, do I write like a young aristrocrat?** I think someone was trying to express a negative attitude in a comment on my last post but it sure felt like a compliment to me :)


&nbsp;

**TL;DR: 1mg sub strip eliminated chills, emotional negativity, and the shits.**


Let's start with something I learned today that can be shared with this commmunity. Yesterday I had two bags decent H and roxy both snorted. Did fine, got thorugh work and had a good night's sleep. Prior to that I was using opioids for at least three consecutive days.


I had a 1mg square of sublingual suboxone so I cut it in half and dissolved it after a light breakfast. Over the following hour I messaged my using ""friend"" to see if he got the bulk order of subs that he was supposed to get at 7AM. No bueno, the goal post keeps getting moved. He even asked if I had any of the sub left. I said no then dissolved the second half of the 1mg strip reamnant. 



&nbsp;


In short, what was learned? That you can get away with using 1mg of suboxone for a mild withdrawal. Not everyone would call it ""mild"" but I believe if you're not IV'ing and you didn't snort 2 buns of fent laced stuff the day before that what you expereince the following day is inded mild. 


Now of course I laid out money so my friend could get subs in bulk. The deal was quite sketchy. It consisted of buying two buns for this other guy's brother so that the sub connect would give us subs on his way to work in the AM and pay some moeny too. Instead, the guys brother picked up the H at 7AM and the sub connect stopped responding to messages at 2pm. 


&nbsp;


Oh and my using friend ""found"" $20 so I fucking snatched that shit up. I'm more likley to succeed in using it to procure more subs but if not at least I have some fucking cash. I was able to confirm bits and pieces of my using friend's story but I'll always be paranoid of being lied to unless I see 30 subs appear on his desk upon my arrival.


&nbsp;


**Take-aways:**


* Listen to your instincts and don't fall for enticing opprotunities. 


* 1mg of sub is enough for mild WD. Past experiences show that 3mg is the most I've ever needed and even then it probabl wasn't ""needed"" in the strictest definiteion of the word.


* Suboxone is a very strong and potent medication, your milelage may vary but there is a lot of mis-information about subs. Some of it comes from doctors and is only applicable to the patient it was given to.


* If you've read this whole post and and are full of haterade, shut up because I gave plenty of opportunities to stop reading and included a ""tl;dr"" statement.",1510962440.0

Edit: Getting my first big test immediately. One of my very best friends died (OD'ed on god damn fent pressed blues) this past week while I was in rehab and the funeral is tmrw at noon CST. On one hand, I'm glad I got out of rehab in time to be there to say goodbye to him. On the other hand, I absolutely was planning on laying low and avoiding most all of the people we ran with in the dope game in our area. I know that I could easily just stay home and have good reason but I know if I don't go it will always bother me deep down. So I will 10000% accept any good vibes you want to send my way tmrw. 

I'm not naive enough to think I'm even remotely close to conquering this beast called addiction, but I am confident in my support system and their ability to be there for me and not even give me the chance to slip up bc ""I'm sad and will be around every living connect I've had in the past 5+ years"" I plan on showing up at 11:55, sitting in the back as far away from people as possible, then walking to the car immediately following the conclusion of the service.

I would say it all started this year when at the beginning of the school year I got a bad cold and was prescribed codeine. Basically i feel like it diminished my fear of medicine because i then associating feeling like that with the stuff in my parents medicine cabinet. After a few days of abusing codeine my mom hid it cause I didn't have a cold anymore. Next thing I knew I was looking for more medicine with similar effects. What's funny looking back on it, I was so scared to go over my recommended dose; when I wanted to ""get fucked up"" I would literally add a ml extra. Anyways, my parents are divorced so I go to each one evenly on halves of the week and this was Wednesday so I was going to my dads. As I showed up, i was curious of what he had in his medicine cabinet. One the bottom shelf I just see allergy stuff( and something i used later on called dxm) so then I look at the top shelf. First thing I see is Codeine in the liquid form and thought ""sweet dads got it too, time to party"" then I looked to the right not know what I saw next would control my entire life(not really, it's not morphine or heroin lol). But i saw around 4 bottles; Tramadol, codeine,hydrocodone, and some blood pressure meds. I went straight for the codeine. Did some research online on the starting doses and proceeded to take 2. Felt amazing that night so did the same the next night but added 2 more. Felt great once again. 3rd night, didn't do shit. 4th no reaction to 5 pills. At this point, a lot were missing so I gave up(and around this time I tried the hydros and thought they were as boring as the codeine was). After my experience with codeine I was just looking for something different. I remember looking up Tramadol and immediately seeing ""Snorting tramadol to get high"" and my face lit up. So I grabbed maybe 2 pills put them in a bag and crushed them up in my garage. Then in the garage I set up a line and tried it out. Not really a rush and nothing too cool but it was definitely something omg. So I took to more line before I left and really started to feel it. My face felt a bit numb, my mind heavy, but my head wasn't, and the waves of warmness were very relaxing when sitting still. This lasted maybe 30 minutes to an hour and when it ended I just did another line. Fast forward until Friday. I have band and I take 4-5 pills, crush them up, and put them in my bag so I could have fun at this game. I ended up doing a line in the bathroom before we got on the buses and my friend could tell i was high. On the bus I sat next this friend and she asked for some. I told her you had to snort it but she took a pinch and just put it in her mouth and I did the same a bit later. When it kicked in she was very obviously high and we were both laughing together but then it stopped after 10 minutes and she because a little sick. We tried to redose but found out that it didn't work. Football game sucked and when I got back to the bus I got a fare bit more than before and ended up getting super sleepy but happy. The next day I was very sick all day and then took a weak break. The only reason I got off this easy is because it was very small amounts. The day I started again, I don't really remember. I think it was another football game and instead of crushing the pills, I took 3. This. New. Feeling. Was. Amazing. I decided that day, that ""this was my new drug"". The 3 got bumped up to 5 on the bus and I was extremely sleepy but super happy during the game. Then bus ride home where the 5 was bumped to 7 which was 350mg. That weekend I felt the worse sickness i've ever felt in my life. But the feeling was so great that I started taking them at school. I took at least 3 each day from what I though was 1 week which was actually 2. Now, when I quite, which I have tried, I can not sleep, I don't eat, and I become extremely depressed.

In co-operation with the Federal Criminal Police Office, drug traffickers of the detention center in Ingolstadt, Germany were able to arrest a 19-year-old last week when he was sent a package containing narcotics.

In connection with drug investigations by the Federal Criminal Police Office, investigators of the Ingolstadt Criminal Police Office were informed that an initially unknown person in Ingolstadt should receive a delivery of narcotics by parcel delivery.

Last Wednesday (08.11.2017), the drug detectors then hit. The 19-year-old recipient of the parcel was amazed when immediately after the parcel courier and the detectives were in his apartment with him.

The package included about 5 kilograms of marijuana and 100 grams of amphetamine. During the subsequent search of the rooms, another 1.5 kg of marijuana, about 70 grams of cocaine, numerous LSD trips as well as various merchandising utensils and around 13,000 euros in cash were secured.

As it turned out, the detainee was no stranger to the Ingolstadt Drug Investigators. He is suspected to trade drugs since mid-2015. The investigation continues.

At the request of the public prosecutor's office in Ingolstadt, the investigating judge ordered on the following day on suspicion of commercial trade in narcotics in no small amount the pre-trial detention against the accused.

It all started with the passing of my mother in 2013, we were best friends.. I was always so scared to lose her... and my worst fears came to life at the young age of 17.. I found my whole world dead... gone... at 42. After it happened I moved in with my dad and was pumped full of aderall and anti-depressants until I graduated Highschool...Once i stepped out into the real world i found a good paying job and eventually moved out at 19... far to young.... well as the crippling depression set in while sitting in my one bed room apartment I picked up the bottle... that was my first vice but i never loved it... it was febuary of 2016 that opiates entered my life for the first time... In the form of Hydro-Met (cough syrup with hydrocodone).... I was nervous at first but i thought fuck it im going to see if i can get high... i poured an ounce into a sprite and that was all she wrote.... i was getting 16 ounces a week and it would be gone in 5 days max.... Finally my GP caught on and called me out on it and said i have to take a break... but i went to another doc and kept on chugging... Once I looked up it had already been a year and I cant remember any of it... well the new doc caught on as well and cut me off...And now the one thing that numbed the pain and made me feel wonderful was gone.. i actually got sober for about 2 months and was doing good... Until my wisdom teeth... hello hydro... it was a fucking full on nose dive after that... i moved back home...quit my job... found a oxy plug and spent well over $8,000 in 3 months on oxy.... well once the money went dry i began doing what i will never forgive myself for... i was pawning my grandfathers guns, any jewlery... basically anything with value to my family.... well it wasnt long until dad found out... and literally beat my ass... He carried my ass to every pawn shop and got all the stuff back and that was my rock bottom... hurting my only parent like that... he was devestated and cried for days asking for his son back... my sister doing the same... well i guess it snapped me out of it... i told my dad to get ready for the fight of a lifetime because these next few weeks will be hell.... it was the worst thing next to losing my mom... i litterally just turned my familys whole world upside down... well 90 days sober today and i experienced the highest highs and the lowest lows all before the age of 22... cost my family over $5,000 and of course payimg it back slowly because i turned my life around so drasticly that im now a Corrections officer... I just want people to know its never to late to atleast try... sorry for the novel just proud of sobriety",1510934546.0

I didn't. 

We're explorers, we have so much courage. Sure being a drug addict isn't ideal and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. We have a lot to work on. However, the personality traits that got us there aren't necessarily character flaws. In some ways we are fearless. In other ways we have a big ego. But ultimately we cannot simply be summarized down to a 'bad person'. 


You are not a junkie. You're a dopamine dare-devil. 


PS: Heroin is the worst decision Ive ever made in my life. This post in no way glorifies drugs. It's just nice to have a small break from the constant feelings of guilt and shame and low self worth. If you're reading this and you've never done an opiate, get in touch with me and I can tell you the sad harsh reality of how much this drug has cost me. It's never been worth it and it'll never be worth it. Lots of love. Xo",1511100447.0

First ever opiate habit,  since early september; high dose codeine at least 2 and up to 4/5 times a week until late october/early november where I went through a bit of oxy but more importantly just under 10 evenings of sniffing H in two consecutive binges. Had 5 days clean in there. I was sniffing between .3-.5 a night. 

By my very conservative estimates (30% H purity) I sniffed 150mg at least per evening. 

Prioir to the last binge I seemingly got off scott free but mentally the second H sesh had me far worse afterwords, particularly mentally.

I Lapsed yesterday on the evening of **10 days clean** with 430~mg of codeine and the same this evening after work.

My tolerance seems to have reverted back to near-beginning/pre-october levels. I know I shouldnt push this and i dont intend to (managed to convince myself that since the codeine is being upscheduled a last taste would be passable).

So my question is what do you reckon about any potential impact on WD/rebound. 

With an also conservative (higher rate) metabolism of codeine I consumed two doses equiv to 65mg oral morphine ish. Is this a very small fraction of my very conservative estimate of my nightly consumption of H back in early Nov? I know one night of this likely had no impact but given the two day (two doses, so does this count as similar to a day ish?? Am I overthinking this? Probably) lapse what would you reckon I expect.

Thoughts/advice much appreciated.",1511092824.0

Lifting. Yes, yes I know it's wrong and illegal and I'm a shithead but we stick purely to big chains that can afford to lose it. Not trying to justify what I do but I'm usually flat broke, usually have $3 to my name. I personally believe there's a big difference between stealing from personal people and their hard earned things. I never go that route, no matter how bad I need a fix or how sick I am. I won't even touch non chain, mom and pop type stores. I know it's hard enough for them to compete with monsters like Walmart without shoplifters so I'd feel like a sack of shit going into any place like that and boosting. Anyway to the point.

I used to do LP for the majority of my career and it helps and gives me a lot more inside information than most lifters. I have a general rule that I don't fuck with a place if I know nothing about their security or shoplifting policies. I fucked up out of convenience and broke my rule about a week ago. Didn't know much about the place, but it was a small pharmacy type store of a well known chain. I never have problems at Walgreens and know they don't have LP. I was only going in to get two very very cheap things for personal use, not exactly boosting and low and behold, even though there was not a camera in sight on the sales floor, no one stopped me at the door but 3/4 employees came outside(where there are cameras in the lot) and eye fucked me. 2 hours later a cop comes to my house and gives me a shoplifting court summons and said I was caught red handed on type. I call bullshit and think a sneaky worker saw me at just the wrong moment and either one of them or the camera got my plate number.

Anyway to the REAL point. (Sorry I tend to ramble on posts, especially when I'm high). Said partner and I had plans to wake up early and hit one of the big chains I actually used to work LP at. This place probably brings me 80% of my dope money. You'd be surprised but some of the best stores to hit are the ones who have LP, but even though when I worked there, we were supposed to be there one day a week right at 6am to throw off shoplifters and not make it look like we worked bankers hours. Thing is, it's not really enforced and even if they are on duty(plain clothes) they do on foot surveillance and even if they're good, it's not terribly hard to realize you're being followed. So they open at 6am. We normally hit between 630-645 so at least some other people, mostly contractors, are there. If it's been a while since we've hit said store, sometimes we come back to the car and go back in and hit em twice. It's not until 10am until the pawn shop is open and even though we always hit two separate stores, even if we double dipped in the first store twice, so it's common to come out with 3 loads of concealed mercy. To kill the rest of the time till pawn is open, I'll drive my buddy to clothing stores. Before we met, this was his area of expertise, hardware being mine. Pawn won't take clothes but his dealers take them as a straight trade for dope and usually gives him 30% of the retail value. These guys always want new clothes. 

So between the pawn and the clothes we were looking at a good 6-8 bundles a piece. I had slept 90 minutes the night before and didn't leave myself enough time to get a good nights sleep last night to compensate. Mix lack of sleep with dope, and the fact I'm getting some type of sickness, both of my very loud phone alarms failed to wake me up. I keep in close contact with my mom and since I hadn't heard her texts and responded, I finally woke up when she called...at 210 in the afternoon. Even if we hit the hardware stores that I know have no LP( only 5/11 of the stores in the district are manned by one person), wed never have the time for me to drive 20 minutes to get him, least another 20 to hit the closest store without LP ( since it was the afternoon and the manned stores would have their guys working by now), we'd never make it in time to pawn before it closes st 3pm on Saturdays when they close, and they're closed Sunday. This left us with only with clothes lifting options which nets us less than the hardware alone by far. We decided to take the drive to the king of Prussia mall where he can hit many stores in the area without us driving all over the north of the state hitting separate stores at random. The goal was to get at least 2-3 bundles each as opposed to the 6-8 if we'd done the early morning plan and I'd have fucking woken up, still kicking myself in the ass.

We each got 1.5 buns tonight and will pick up the last bun to split tomorrow. I'll take one my subs tomorrow to conserve dope. I go through at least 2 buns or more a day so with one and a half and getting back late, I could do a good bit tonight and save about 6 stamps to shoot before we lift next chance we get since it'll have to be soon since today we didn't get nearly enough.

Anyway I guess that's my shitpost and end of my rant. I hate switching back to my subs and the longer I've been using dope the worse I feel. I'm sure many know what I mean but in case you don't it basically feels like this. You take your first subs after being in dope and 5-6 hours later (for me) I feel like I HAVE to go to bed. I'll sleep for at least 6-8 hours even in he middle of the day. Might stay up fir about an hour if I need to then I can sleep a whole nights worth. So basically the first day is spent with an almost required sleep and about the first half of the second day. Once you're done sleeping you feel like shit mentally. Yes the subs will make sure you don't get the physical WD but you do feel god awful mentally. Even when you wake up, you don't want to do shit. I can literally be in bed with my tv remote within arms reach and j have no interest in it. I can't be bothered to go to my computer and game, which is usually my favorite thing to do and all I do when I'm home with free time. This lasts a good 3 days before I'd say you're semi back to normal, meaning you can get up and out and do things but it's at least a week, 2 to feel completely back to normal and at least semi content with just being on subs. So I'll get High tonight. Take subs in the morning to conserve and if I'm lucky only have to do that for tomorrow and get back to the boosting Monday... Tuesday if I can't cancel this colonoscopy which I know is going to be useless.

Anyway, hope you all had better days. End of too long rant/vent and shitpost.",1511063561.0

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. 
thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1511061656.0

My grandma's fat ass dog was chewing on something and my aunt asked what it was. I originally wasn't going to do anything about it, but just to appease her I put my hands in his mouth and made him drop what he had. To my horror a cap drops out. She immediately states, ""What the heck is that? Medicine?"" I hurriedly grab it and wrapped it in my hand to throw away. I said, ""yeah it looks like a medicine capsule, I don't know how in the world he got it but I'll throw it away.""

Of course at this point my entire family is interested and wanting to see it. There was still a little bit of product in it but I kept saying it was medicine and then threw it away. Then of course another one was found on the floor, I hurriedly grabbed it and set it in the trash on top of a plate. Hoping I could go back later and grab it discreetly.

Of course at his point my parents are side eyeing me because they've found caps before. No one will drop the subject wondering how in the world the dog got medicine. I go back to where he was and THANK JJ there was my grandma's empty medicine bottle on the floor. So my family agreed that is 100% where he got the caps.  I go back once more and do another look so no one else will and find one more untouched cap, and pretend to throw it away.

We leave and look at the cap I saved and it was 100% what we had picked up earlier. I don't think the dog ate any, and even if he did it wouldn't touch him. 

I try SO hard to be careful. This time it was my SO who had them in his pocket. Our dude must have gave us extra cause he said he had all of the ones counted from earlier still on him. ",1511057543.0

I had motivation, no cravings, my depression was improved, even my anxiety was lessened to the point where i was in utter shock. I am now no longer feeling good at 2mg. I get slight relief from my dose but it doesnt seem to be doing the trick anymore. Really any positives i just mentioned are slowly but surely slipping away.

I know there is a matter of finding the ""right dosage"" but im scared that this will be an on going thing and i truly do not want to exceed anything further than 6mg as i know less is more & the higher the dose the more difficult the journey off it is.

7dxbmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7dxbmm/my_specialist_appointmentsecond_opinion/,8,https://redd.it/7dxbmm,dori_88,My Specialist Appointment/Second Opinion,"Heya Bropiates. After meeting with the 2nd opinion pain management appoint last week I flew over 400 miles a week later on short notice to be seen by the addiction specialist.

The specialist wanted me to start a Buprenorphine patch which I am 100% willing to do and want to do despite the potential for a seizure. 

I had a seizure once when I tried a 2mg/0.5mg suboxone film. They think the 0.5mg naloxone in the Buprenorphine and the high dose of Buprenorphine caused me to have a seizure along with the potential of other drugs in my system.

They think microgram dosing of the Buprenorphine in a patch would be perfect for me. At first I was nervous about doing this but after meeting with the addiction specialist she recommended a few things:

1. USE THE PATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CURRENT 30MG NARCOTIC DOSE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES EXCEPT ADDING THE LOW DOES PATCH.
2. DO IT ALL INPATIENT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL SEIZURE
3. EVENTUALLY WEEN OFF THE NARCOTIC AND JUST BE ON THE BUPRENORPHINE PATCH
4. GET OFF EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BUPRENORPHINE WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT 1.5-2.5 YEARS FROM NOW. 

I do eventually want to be off the drugs, but it's hard you know.

I was so surprised she recommended to keep me on the narcotic, 30mgs of oxycodone. She said if I do it that way I'll most likely eliminate problems with breaking through the suboxone on my receptors for the pain problems. 

Then when I have pain flares if I could use an at home script I'd be able to stay out of the hospital and have 24/7 pain relief instead of this yo-yo*ing* effect and nightly withdrawals I've been dealing with. 

The specialist seemed to think staying on the microgram dosing wouldn't block the opiate the way it does in 2mg+ doses. It'd be like a 20mcg dose so it'd be easier/simplier to breakthrough the pain 

She alaso said later on down the line once I get stability I could switch to just the patch alone and then from there potentially come off of the patch entirely.

***I'm really happy about this.***

Unfortunately, my parents aren't on board and accused me of lying to the doctor about things, when I was brutally honest. I don't think I've ever been this honest with doctors before and this was her professional opinion. 

I'm upset with my family they keep calling me a street junkie and belittle me over my use of drugs in the first place and they say a lot of deeming things, but it's rough because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm  just trying to do the right thing for my pain and it just seems like my parents are unsupportive and it's really upsetting me quite a bit.

I'm doing fine with it, even though it's pretty hard to feel emotions and physical ailments unfiltered. I've been branching out in terms of everything, social life, music, books etc. which keeps me busy and offers at least a modicum of excitement.


I don't feel cravings towards heroin at all. That is surprising to me, since I had been shooting up daily for two years without major interruptions. Cocaine is a much bigger issue though. I crave a bellringer so badly. In a perverse way I feel a strange tingling of nostalgia when reminiscing on my coke days. Just sitting on my bed for hours, fixing a shot, yakking, heart beating out of my chest, sweating bullets. My entire life was condensed into one thought: how do I obtain more coke so I can rush hard again? It's completely fucked, but I would kill to smoke some rock/shoot some soft, regardless of the damage it did.


And it did inflict a great deal of damage upon me, my entire life spiralled away during the Speedball Summer of 2016. My veins are shot, my finances are fucked and my dopamine household is out of whack. I often feel like neither Heroin nor Crystal are the big bad ones in terms of drugs. IV cocaine/crack is so much more destructive.


So anyway, just needed to vent. I can't really do that on the cocaine subreddit, since they look down on any ROA that isn't snorting. That's retarded to me, snorting coke is like buying a 5000 dollar, water-cooled gaming machine to play solitaire.",1511048042.0

 I have been on methadone for years and at my clinic they have posts up all over the place about getting your free Narcan kit. I have lurked in this subreddit for forever and have seen just way to many post and comments about how you people wish you could afford or get your hands on Narcan and I know that there are a few people on here that are amazing and send packs of all sorts to ppl in need and for free and I think that's just amazing. Ok on to my question do you think or does anyone know if I can ask for Narcan multiple times. I don't use anymore so really the ppl that work in the clinic would wonder why I want more then one kit even if I spread out the times of when I ask for the next kit. I live in a city that has almost zero heroin use and it's mostly pills and I haven't heard to much about the pills here being laced with fent but also because of that I feel like asking for a few kits and sending them to those who really need it isn't a big deal here. I obviously don't want to tell the clinic my real reason but if I can get my hands of even just a few and mail them out it's better then none. Just wondering if anyone in Canada has asked for multiple kits and what did they say? I want to help if I can and I thought that might be a start. In Ontario kits are paid for. At least where I am it's free. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I just want to help if I can. It should be free to everyone!

When I was 18 I began having several period pain. I ended up in Emergency Room and they sent me home with a script for a pain reliever they called “Severdol” 100 little blue tablets. At first these made me vomit and itch but I stuck at it and I began to enjoy them. After a week I would take them after school just to take a good nap. I told them the pills made me nauseous so they also prescribed cyclazine , which I found when I combined them with the Severdol I had an even better time.  

I eventually decided to go to the GP and ask for a repeat of these , as I was running out. The doctor laughed in my face and told me that those are morphine pills and no I could not have them. I had no idea I had been taking morphine , I had been driving on them and everything. 

I started to really stress out when the pills dried up and ended up going to ED again , I would usually get a few shots of morphine and sent home with another script. 

I finally got my life together at age 20 and was clean for 5 years , until last year I broke my leg. The GP gave me 100 30mg Codiene with 3 repeats. I didn’t think they would do anything for me but if I take them with the cyclazine they are pretty nice. It’s now almost 2 years later , the doctor renews the script for 100 30mg codiene every 3 months and gives me another 3 month supply , he thinks I take it for period pain but I honestly take it because I have to at this point. I don’t take more than the recommended dose 60mg up to 3 times daily but as soon as I don’t have it I feel so much pain. I think this is going to be harder to kick than the morphine was.

But after some horrific experiences and that  I truly decided and told myself that I needed to quit was I finally able to conquer my demon. I don’t have any major advice for getting clean but I may be able to offer some words that can motivate some looking to get clean.

One of the best feelings I’ve ever felt (even over heroin) was when during my early days of getting clean that I realized “holy shit I haven’t thought about heroin in days”.

It used to be wake up -> think of heroin, get heroin -> then think of how ill get more heroin once I come down, repeat.

It’s such a fucking relief to no longer feel that cycle or daily thoughts anymore.

Another one of the most important things ever said to me was when I went to visit my good friend after not seeing him for months that his mother said that “I look like I’m doing much better.” That really fucking stuck with me because I never felt my use would be that noticeable to where someone would ever say that. But it was. And that small sentence meant the world to me after hearing and really set my mind on being off this shit forever.

figured I'd post this & see where it went. I don't know anyone else who messes with ops so I'm talking here.

for a about a year I've been pretty heavy into drugs. I've always been interested in them & smoked weed quite a bit since I was 17. I lost my mother when I was 17 in a car crash & just turned 22 on the 4th. 
around this time last year my great grandmother passed whom I was very close to and it hit me hard. I think the next week I randomly hit up a dude I knew and asked if he had any H. 
I had done more than my fair share of pills & (stupidly) was sure I wouldn't get addicted. after a few weeks of just buying points & loons, I was hooked. I did it every chance I got. sold some cool shit I regret blah blah blah you guys know how it goes.
i had tried coke a few times before & one night I wanted to get some after my first payday at my job I started as some sort of twisted celebration I guess?? long story short, I got arrested that night for possession of coke (1g).
I started my 3 year probation in February this year. I have quit doing H since all that happened last year but I'll still hit it if it's around for whatever reason I don't know.
in the past month I've got my first job I have ever actually been proud of. my first job learning a trade. however in the past month I've also been buying coke. like a gram every 3-4 days. (I definitely stretch it out.) it helps me at work & makes me more confident which is something I've always had a lot of trouble with.
I've never been one to admit I need to go to a therapist or whatever but I'm confused & was curious about a couple things. 

-I've never been a fan of uppers but I've grown very fond of the one mentioned above.

-I feel like I subconsciously switched dependency? I was happy to finally not be dependent on opiates.

-I am supposed to be taking drug tests for my probation. why can't I shake this hopeless feeling & make myself care more? I find myself pushing meetings back.

-why can't I be happy with the good life that I have? I've been asking this for too long. /:

7e7k5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e7k5s/questions_on_oxynaxolone_pills/,7,https://redd.it/7e7k5s,OstoFool,Questions on oxy/naxolone pills,"I'm from Australia and doctors are generally just prescribing Targin now. Brand names might differ from country to country, but they are extended release oxy/naloxone blends at a ratio of 2:1.

What we know: naloxone is added to prevent abuse and help relieve constipation. It does help with the latter, but you absolutely cannot take Targin with any other ROA other than oral to minimize the naloxone exposure. You can crush the pills up and parachute them for IR, however the maximum prescribed dose of 40/20 has been successful in limiting abuse. I'm prescribed 15/7.5 pills, and I can catch a quick high with potentiators (DXM and GF Juice) if I bomb 3 at once. 45/22.5 is the maximum dose I can take before the nax starts to pull the oxy away in noticeable amounts. Even though oral bioavailability is less than 2%.

What I can't figure out is the naloxone half life. Apparently it's only 30-80minutes, regardless of ROA, so hypothetically, I should be able to stack oxy doses two hours apart and get higher. I've even stretched this to 2.5 hours, but I swear additional pills only seem to sober me up due to naloxone concentration, when the original dose should have metabolized out of my system by that point.

These abuse-proof pills are getting rolled out in other countries apparently, so surely it's something that other users have had to experiment with. It's going to affect all pill users eventually.

So, for those that have been using oxy/nax blends...

What is the max dose of oral oxy/nax you can do at one time before getting diminishing returns from the naxolone?

How long between doses can you get high from without naloxone concentrations building up and killing it?

This is unlikely, but has anyone found a way to filter out the naloxone from pills, or found an enzyme that can motabilize it faster?

I'm convinced that high oral naloxone concentrations increase the half life of the drug considerably, because I can take another 40/20 parachuted two hours after a previous dose and I feel straighter than had I not taken it at all. And according to all literature, the original dose of naloxone should have passed by that point.

I gave it four hours yesterday between bombs and still felt very dimished returns. I'm wondering if it's just me and I don't metabolize naloxone as fast as others do, but it's killing my high in a big way. I absolutely cannot stack oxy doses and basically can't get high anymore.

I swear I could get higher off one 30mg IR oxy than a 50mg oxy/25mg nax bomb that I'm doing these days. Tolerance aside. The naloxone is not only capping my ceiling dose of oxy, but I find it reduces the effectiveness by at least 30%.

This is gonna affect all of you soon. Apparently the oxycontin manufacturer is going to roll it out globally to try and hold a monopoly on the ER oxy market since the patent is expiring soon.

It would be great if a redditor with some experience in pharmacology could comment on how to remove or at least metabolize the naxolone quicker.

Or provide some insight into possible extended oral half life of naloxone in high concentrations, because the pharmacology on it that's well published doesn't make sense. The half life is extending well beyong the 80 minutes!

Someone tell.me they are in the same boat. Apparently Targin are flooding the dark net too, because that's all doctors are prescribing in many countries.",1511167897.0

Sketchy as fuck. My ""friend"", Cliff convinced me to spend my last $190. That the following day his friend would deliver 30 subs + give him $85 that would go right back into my pocket. I've asked four times and I still don't remmeber why the guy was supposed to pay us $85. If the story was true, perhaps he was lying about the price of a bun to the guy.... Oh yeah and part of the deal would be that we would buy two buns of H for the sub connect's brother. The sub connect doesn't use dope anymore but his brother does.

&nbsp;

First on Thursday night the goal post kept getting moved forward until I was on my way home with the understanding that the subs would be delivered by 7:30am. Cliff texted me at 7:30 stating the guy was not called into work and would come around later. 

Later that afternoon Cliff says ""the sub connect left his house at 2pm."" After that no he alleged that he got no more message responses.

Around 5pm that day Cliff text me that he made a mistake. Upon arriving at his house he explains that, the sub connect's brother came by his house at 7:30 am to pick up the two buns. That the sub connect stopped answering his phone after 2pm and now the phone is off. 


&nbsp;

Great so now I'm out $190, and have no way to get my anxiously awaited subs. Oh wait, Cliff found $20 in his other pants. So he gives that to me, I go to find his sister but she's out so I can't get subs through her at that time.

The following morning, he calls my cell and house phone. Explains that the dboy is willing to credit a bun if we give him the $20. I fucking snap, like damn it all to hell. Fucking have some damn patience or something and wait.. splitting a bun between two people gets them well for a night and a day but a sub can last much longer especially the way I cut them up. 

Well, I gaveh im back the $20 because I'm a junkie and wouldn't mind one last hurrah of getitng high.. plus wishful thinking, maybe he's not lying about his friend with 30 subs and maybe that guy will miraculously show up. 


&nbsp;

So I snort some fent powder (the dboy literally said it was fent) mixed with what seemed like salt and I was quite faded that night and well for up to 16 hours after my last does. Even after that I didn't feel ill effects until the cold air started getting me and eating dominos pizza didn't help. My ""friend"" didn't rob me of half a bun as I thought he might. I was expecting him to say ""dboy only delivered half a bun... here's two bags."" So if he was truthful and honest about splitting a bun with me, maybe he wasn't lying about my $190 going towards subs?


Fuck, I'm making my own head spin. I think it's likely I was scammed... That's why I already made a doctor's appointment on my next pay day. I need to separate myself from this shit, I'm too easy to manipulate and take advantage of. I'm sick and tired of going to work dope sick. 


As for the money, without insurance I'll still come out ahead going to a psyciatric professional.

&nbsp;


**Long story short:**
tl;dr:

I managed to borrow $20 from another friend, bought two subs and provided some services the person who walked to the sub connect and who successfully procured subs. I thanked my ""friend's"" sister profusely and helped her patch a hole in her air mattress, and ran a long CAT5e cable so that her computer would no longer be plagued by wifi issues when streaming TV. 

When I indicated I was gonna give half a sub to her brother she detested the idea. ""Those are for you.."" she said in addition to platitudes about her brother being a lazy con artist which are somewhat true but who am I to judge?

I told my friend Cliff that I'd try to get the subs in the morning before work.. moved the goal post forward a bit as he often does to me.

**Question:**

Do I give Cliff half a sub tomorrow or say fuck him? I can technically part with half a sub based on my taper plan, but it never hurts to have extra. 

Sometimes he has helped me stay well but other times he has lied to me and left me in a vulnerable position such as going to work outright dopesick after counting on a lie from him.

Realistically, how many more bags can I safely consume? I have a low-moderate tolerance, and this is my third day in a row of using.

I'm looking at poor and high quality drug treatment, following some of the insights in articles like these, http://theinfluence.org/the-rehab-industry-badly-needs-to-clean-up-its-act-heres-how/  by Maia Ssalavitz              and Anne Fletcher's Inside Rehab book. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008EKMAC4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1

I'd like to get  views and personal stories of current or former opioid users, while protecting your identity in off-the-record interviews, about mediocre or fragrantly terrible or fraudulent treatment you've received in the past or currently. I'm also interested in understanding why there is increasing counterfeit fentanyl use and your views about why dealers are selling product that kills their customers? Also, I'm interested in understanding any illegal or improper use of Suboxone or other medication-assisted drugs while you continue to abuse opioids. Is it because Suboxone and related medications are so hard to obtain, expensive and so few doctors offer it? Is it commonly used or abused as a street drug?

 You can contact me via personal message here and let me know if you're open to being interviewed off the record,and the best way to reach you. If anyone wants to go on the record, that's appreciated, but not necessary. I'd prefer a phone interview, but live chat is acceptable, but hardly preferred. Most people on reddit currenly don't have access to its brand-new chat function. 

I  had a cover story recently in Newsweek about VA fueling the nation's opioid crisis and killing thousands of veterans through accidental overdoses, then a draconian turn-around that's needlessly cutting off chronic pain patients of opioids, increasing suicides. That cover story and related articles can be found here:

I've also written on the Trump administration's war on people with mental illness, opioid addiction and chronic pain, for AlterNet:

 Those articles derived from my book, Mental Health, Inc., looking at failed and successful behavioral health programs.  https://www.amazon.com/Mental-Health-Inc-Corruption-Vulnerable/dp/1468308378.

So in my mind he's an okay guy and wouldn't do me wrong. Like he's given me fronts and shit.

Until one night I'm with him in his car and I forgot my prescription bottle of 38 Xanax bars inside it. I proceed to blow up his phone to no avail. At this point I'm fucking livid and ready to curbstomp this fucker. So I go home and sleep it off and wake up still ready to kick ass but I have nowhere to find him, even went to his house but there were no cars there.

Anyway, a good friend of mine from back in the day calls me today saying he hit a lick on S. Apparently my boy was buying some dab rigs from S but when S gets in the car he gets a Glock with a 50 round drum in his face and gets told to run his pockets. So he takes everything from him from his phone to his car and leaves him in Sacramento without any shoes on and tells him to walk home. As I'm hearing this I busted up laughing because I knew karma would get him back. 

Anyway, moral of the story is don't fuck people over because you don't know who they know.",1511149056.0

Everything is perfect!,"For a long time, my routine used to be one half gram shot shortly after I woke up, and that was my dope for the whole day until I went to sleep, woke up, rinsed and repeated. 
Lately, though, I’ve been doing very small shots (half a .1 to one .1) throughout the whole day so I can satisfy my needle fetish and collect more cottons. 
If you go through my post history and look at my most recent post before this one, you’ll see I had a shitty night tonight, on top of all the shitty bullshit-ass fucked up problems going on in my life lately. So tonight I said “Fuck it!” and loaded up about .6 to .7 in a single shot. I registered and blasted off. 
I haven’t gotten a rush or even gotten high off dope in probably a month or so because of my tolerance and the fact I don’t let myself buy more than a $20 half g each day, and that’s not enough to feel it even if I do the whole half g in one shot. 

And HOLY GODDAMN FUCKING SHIT, man...! That rush!!! 
I wasn’t expecting it to hit me so strong, but as soon as that rush hit me, it was so strong that I had trouble seeing straight and focusing my eyes. Goddamn have I missed a true, full-strength heroin high. This is why I fell in love with Mistress Heroin. 
I feel like I’m on top of the world, invincible, like everything is perfect. Now I’m just riding that beautiful, beautiful high and smoking a cigarette on my back porch with my husband. I’m not particularly physically affectionate, but I feel so fantastic that I asked him for a big bear hug and a bunch of kisses. (Which made my husband very happy. 😍😍😍) 

On a final note, I hope my whole r/opiates family is doing as great as I am tonight!
 Everyone who’s using, I hope your high is as amazing as mine. Remember to stay safe. You can always do more but you can never do less. Keep Narca around and make sure you’re with someone who knows how to administer it. 
Everyone who’s sober, or trying to stay sober, you can do it! Just take it one day at a time, sometimes even just minute to minute. Stay strong! 
And to everyone, stay safe and have a great night!!! Love you all! I feel like I belong here and (for the most part) everyone here is so accepting and positive and helpful. It really feels like a family here, albeit a fucked up, disfunctional, addict-ridden family. I love each and every member here and am glad to share a space with you all. Anyone who ever wants/needs to talk, about anything at all, is more than welcome to PM me anytime and I’ll listen and give advice with absolutely no judgement. I promise.

I made a post a few days ago describing my current situation in life. Well, things went from bad to worse. Three days ago my mother accused me of being ""stoned"" or snorting coke, when I was not even high. I had been around her high the day before, and she didn't say a word. She lashed out and attacked me, so I decided that there was no way I could go home. I called my grandmother, and she said I could stay with her. Well, when my mom found out I was with my grandmother, she lost her shit even more. She said that she would never talk to me, or my grandmother again. She said that I betrayed her. My father then proceeded to call my grandmother and bitch her out for taking me in. So now I have created some huge ass problem within my family. Holy shit. How could my father bring my grandmother into the problem like that? I feel terrible. Next, the only friend I had pulled some bullshit on me. We have been friends for years now, and he has suddenly declared that he's madly in love with me. He knows all of the bullshit I've been going through, and yet he decided to throw that on me.

I have to cut the friendship off now, because it's just sick and unhealthy. He is incapable of being someone I can chill with or talk to. When I say I'm alone, I really mean it.

I was cleaning trucker cum off of showers when suddenly this ragged older hippy lady confronts me as guests (we're trained to call them that. how lame.) often do. She was asking me if I knew anything about the credit card machine for the washing machines, a situation which arises more often than I'd like. I don't have time to deal with this shit.

 Well, this time I did for some reason. 
I call my manager back there to speak with her through the radio, and go about my business. As I'm folding piss, mucus, shit, vile fluid-stained towels, I overhear her talking about some top secret scheme the government has going against us. I keep at it, cleaning showers as usual. I've made up my own routine by now. The shortcut way, the efficient way, and probably not the most sanitary way is what I've adapted to using since time is always of the essence. If there are two guests waiting, I'm fucked otherwise. 
Well, she was once of the previous guests apparently. She stopped me again to tell me what a nice job I had done on cleaning the showers. They were ""beautiful"". 

Of course she saw everything that way. This woman was either on heavy amounts of drugs or just straight batshit insane. She went off on rants about ""the man"" basically, trying to shut us down with this shit jobs and prescription drugs, etc. (which I partially agree with, but that's a different matter). She went on to say how she was traveling with her friend who was a ""sensitive"". I asked what that is and she said he's someone who can actually sense events before they happen and such things. Apparently, they were traveling in a van together and stopped by my store because ""you guys always have clean showers"". She went on and on rambling about some wild shit about vibrations and feelings and sounds and various topics. Conspiracies mostly. Then she ended by telling me I'm a gem and capable of much more than cleaning showers. 

For a moment there I pondered over her statements to me, wondered if it was a sign, and thought seriously about getting my life together. Then I probably went home and took more xanax, bupe, and vaped dank. Such is (this) life. I'm so over and done with trying to bring an early end to myself. I have someone in my life who makes it worth living now. So, with her help I'm tapering one drug at a time until I'm off it all. Except some medical weed. If I have to jump in a van with hippies and live life on the road, then I will. Until next time, peace out opiate family.

A little background:

I am a victim of domestic violence, and for years now my partner has been pilfering my strips for his own abuse problems. Seeing as he pays for my treatment, every time I confront him about it, he threatens me with not paying anymore. I live in a rural area and there is only one seedy cash clinic nearby. Despite having 90/10 insurance, they won't even hear of taking it. 

I can usually work around this and mete out my doses out for the month but things just got out of hand with my partner's need to get high, and my refill isn't for another 10 days. My bottle is empty.

My usual dose is one 8/2mg strip 2x per day. Now, to my question: If I take a hefty dose of maeng da kratom, will that stop some of the withdrawal effects? I am calling my doctor tomorrow first thing, but for now this is my only option. 

I took the kratom on an empty stomach, along with 1 mg xanax (prescribed for panic disorder). According to the kratom bag, I took 6 grams. 

Thank you all for any help you can provide. I am actually going to escape this relationship within the week, and have received overwhelming support from my family.",1511129869.0

7e3nce,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e3nce/for_those_heavily_addicted_i_now_somewhat/,6,https://redd.it/7e3nce,Mr_J111,"For those heavily addicted, I now (somewhat) understand and fear I may end up going down that road.","For starters, I am dependent on Kratom (20g a day) for depression and knee pain. It does serve it's purpose for depression and body pain. Since it does have a binding affinity to the mu opioid receptors, technically, I guess I am already a (lightweight) mild opiate addict.

I suffer from PTSD and chronic anxiety (my ""excuse""). I am heavily addicted to benzo's (was a very heavy drinker but found benzos to be the lesser of 2 evils). I know that I would be in severe trouble if I was suddenly out of benzos...Anyway, to my point about which drugs do what for me.

Benzo's - My mind tends to race 1000 miles an hour. I over analyze every situation and expect the worst outcome. Wherever I go,  my mind is constantly scanning for potential danger and creating an exfil/ fight or flight plan if one of these scenario's do occur. Benzo's are not fun for me, they simply allow my mind to tell me ""woah, relax a bit bud, you don't have a bunch of people out to kill you"".


Psychedelics (particularly tryptamines) - Allow me to escape to another dimension and kindly explain to me what is wrong in my life. It will then tell me how I can go about fixing it and what it will accomplish.
 Purely educational for me and have been beneficial for giving me the courage to seek help and/or make the necessary changes in my life (which is still a massive work in progress).


Alcohol - I rarely ever drink now, but when I did, it was similar to benzos for me. Numb the pain and slow down life. I was never drunk, I drank steadily around the clock. Just enough to drown out the anxious feelings but enough to make me quite physically ill. I am convinced that had I not switched to benzo's, I would not have a liver. Sure I have had bouts of complete sobriety from everything for up to 4 months. It was honestly the worst 4 months of my life.


Stimulants - I am very fond of this class of drugs because they allow me to keep up with the pace of life and enjoy it (diagnosed adhd as well but suspect it is a co-morbid symptom of ptsd). I quite enjoy the often terrifying situations that come about and not only do I get a huge dopamine rush, but I also get shit done.


Weed - Allows me to relax a bit but I can't get anything done. I become creative and sex becomes much more enjoyable. I have only recently started smoking again (mostly indica) because it is a powerful tool that allows me to lower my benzo usage a great deal.


Opiates - I was always one to grab some percocets or oxy's when they were around. It was a nice way to spend the day kicking back and relaxing. It was very occasional and I never became addicted (unless Kratom counts).


Now the part that scares me.... About a week ago, I got some strong prescription opiates (I do not want to post exactly what atm) but it was enough for a weekend of nodding.


WOW! I was nodding for the first time and it was heavenly. For the first time in many years, I felt at peace, no worries about anything.
Sure, benzos help me slow down to a walking pace, but this.....This feeling allowed me to completely stop running or even walking. Instead I was able to just lay in the grass and relax without a care in the world.


I hit one state where everything seemed to be made of gold and my mattress was like lying on a heavenly cloud. I thought to myself ""this is it, this is the nod everyone talks about, it's quite possibly the most beautiful thing I've felt"". 


I continued dosing through Saturday and Sunday all day, it was absolute paradise. I did not have to worry about eating, work or doing anything. I even brought a big empty jug next to my bed to piss in because getting out of bed was work that was interfering with my nod.


That feeling; once it hit while smoking a cigarette and I could barely keep my head up: I can only describe as the brightest golden ray of sunshine warmly embracing me. Then, I knew it was time to go back to my cloud (bed) and not give a fuck about anything - Just enjoy the heavenly warmth of everything...Everything that is safe, beautiful and sacred around me. Music took on a whole new direction for me and was indescribably serine. I am now hooked on ""The Revivalists - Wish I knew ya"" because it was the most beautiful hymn to come from the heavens while in my golden state. Listening to it almost brings me back there.


As an addict, I already know how my addict brain works. It will do everything in it's power to have that feeling again and if I am not careful, I will be chasing the dragon everyday severely addicted to another substance. I know where that road leads and to become addicted to another substance will surely result in my demise.


After a week, my brain is somewhat trying to reason with me. It is telling me to go after that feeling again. It's the kind of feeling I want to have every 2 months when I have a weekend to do nothing. Sounds reasonable enough to me if I were to only use for a couple of days every 2 months right? Well...I guess I just fear my addict brain will take over. Those 2 days every 2 months will become 3 days every month eventually leading to every weekend and before I know it, the claws of addiction will once again have full control over me.


I can honestly say that I am not craving that feeling (well, maybe a bit) and can wait a few months to try again. Perhaps it's my addict brain trying to trick me. I guess I am not asking any questions, I am just posting my feelings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but hell. I can't wait for another couple of months to go by so I can have that feeling again.

TL;DR - I'm a poly substance addict (mostly benzo's and stims) and a recovering alcoholic with PTSD. I had my first taste of strong opiates and it was a better feeling than any drug I have EVER tried. Better than high quality coke, methamp, MDMA, ketamine, DMT, xanax, sex: It did not matter, nothing came close to that golden paradise of nodding.

I have a big sack (250g) of Red Bali Kratom from Gaia Ethnobotanical. I also have a tiny bit of Gold MD but that's literally a gram worth. Can I mix the Gold MD with Red Bali?

&nbsp;

I'm fifteen hours from my last dose of dope. I feel surprisingly fine right now but expect to feel worse between tonight and tomorrow. I'm really surprised that I'm not being assailed by the cold chills but I expect that to occur eventually.

&nbsp;

**Should I wait until I start feeling stronger ill effects of opiate withdrawal before I start consuming Kratom?** I'm thinking of eating two grams straight at a time and no more than four or five grams in one sitting. I really hate the taste but I'm willing to get it down if it'll prevent me from feeling like total hell.

&nbsp;

Personally I'm more comfortable with 1-2mg doses of Suboxone but I'm willing to give Kratom another chance. I remember it worked one time for me before a work day. Another time I was using Kratom over the course of two days when I started getting intense stomach pains. It was suggested that I make tea out of it. The time I got the stomach pains, I was consuming Kratom inside of vegetable  gelatin capsules so I guess eating ten capsules in one sitting wasn't the best idea.  

&nbsp;

**P.S.- I'm more concerned about how many times per day to dose.** I just had a cup of hot chocolate mixed with Kratom. I used a tea infuser and compressed it after letting it steep in the hot chocolate.",1511123659.0

I took oxy a few times for my wisdom teeth surgery back a long time ago, and morphine for a broken collar bone in elementary school, but nothing since then, not even in college. The closest thing I'd say I do is kratom sometimes, but that's it. 

I am still very interested in opiates, addiction, and psychoactive substances in general. I've been reading through this sub for quite some time just lurking and have been pleasantly surprised by you guys. At first I expected just to see everyone talking about all their drugs, or what they were gonna take next (do see this some but no as much as I thought) but I saw kind of the opposite. 

You guys actually encourage each other to quit, and when someone posts here that theyre X days clean, you guys congratulate them and tell them to keep going. I'm not sure why I expected to see comments such as ""nah come back man. Heroin awaits!"" Or some shit like that, but I haven't seen that once. I guess it's because you all know better than anyone else how it feels, and I'm sure deep down everyone wants to quit or at least is thinking about it. I'm very surprised (pleasantly) that you guys are so supportive of each other and encourage to discontinue use! I figured the quitting opiates sub would be like that and that this one would be encouraging it. 

Not really too related to opiates overall, but just wanted to post this to let you guys know that from an outsiders point of view, I think this sub is great and encourages the right decisions! Keep it up guys. ",1511122371.0

Lost my baby, and it's all been downhill from there.","Two years ago I had a bad fight with my boyfriend that got physical, all my friends had just moved away to college and the only person I trusted was my cousin whos an addict. She brought her shit over and was prepping a shot for herself while we were talking and started pushing me to have some. I wasn't in my right mind because my boyfriend had been choking me the night before and I was trying to figure out what to do, but I did have experience with opiates. I used to take at least 25 Tylenol with codeine a night, and I figured if anything shooting one hydromorph would be safer than all the shit in the pills. So I let her talk me into it. I didn't like it much, didn't feel much either so really all it did was make me more curious. So I kept doing it.

A few weeks go by and I'm a full on addict, and hustling for my fix every day. Doing coke when I hung out with my cousin for fun, and fuck anything else I could get my hands on. I tried H a few times but I must have cooked the shit out of it or it was cut to shit because I never fell in love with it and was sure dillies were my DOC. After Christmas last year I got on methadone and I've been doing so well since then. I almost had all my carriesv(even though I still used the odd time it was just out of my system by sample day)

Then about a month ago I found out I was pregnant. I did all the right things. My boyfriend (same one as before) didn't want me to keep it, was pushing me to have an abortion. I knew if I did keep it I'd be doing it on my own, but my mind was made up. I'd decided I'd do it and I'd make it work because I already loved that little bean inside me more than I thought possible and it had only been a couple weeks.

Fast forward a few weeks and I just don't feel right, seems like my pregnancy symptoms have almost gone away and I'm getting worried. So I spend that day in the ER. They told me they couldn't come to a conclusion because I was only about 8 weeks but they couldn't find a heartbeat (although they said that could be positioning of the baby) but my HCG had also dropped by 8000 since the week before. I was told to return in a few days. I got home and six hours later I was stuck in the bathroom because I was bleeding so damn much, passing clots the size of my hand. I knew then for sure that I'd lost the baby. It was hard but I handled it alright, until 4 days later when I pulled my pants down to pee and there was a recognizable fetus sitting on the pad I was wearing. I just about lost it. In some ways it was good because I had my minute with the baby, in other ways it was really bad. Despite passing the fetus I continued bleeding for three weeks. All during this time I started using daily. At first for the pain, then to forget. 

Then at the three week mark I start having those big rushes of blood like I did that day I got home from the hospital with the big clots and everything except it was happening like every 15-20 minutes. I looked like a ghost. I couldn't even stand up anymore. There was something really wrong. So I was rushed to the hospital, they didn't even do an ultrasound they just looked at my blood work said I wouldn't make it through the night if they didn't do something and did an emergency d&c. This was kinda traumatic for me, and I got so angry at my body. The two things it's made to do are carry a child, and when it can't then get rid of all the products of conception. That's what my body is built for, but it couldn't do either of those things properly. I felt like less of a woman. I was so disappointed in myself, so angry at everything else too. 

I'd picked up heroin once before I went into the ER, a few days before and not much and I knew I'd get back on track, and I started to. But after being in the hospital and having the D&C I feel like I'm back to square one and have to come to terms with losing my baby all over again. All I've done since I've been home is use. I've picked up heroin multiple times, done more hydromorph than I can count. Today I even missed my methadone so I'd have an excuse to use more. So I went and spent $100 on heroin, and also picked up a hydro 12, and 4 8mg hydros. I know it'll all be gone by like maybe 2am at the latest but probably much earlier. I'm just really disappointed in myself. I'd come so far. But at the same time, I want to allow myself to grieve however I need to.

One fell through, the other I did 1 day and he hasn't called back (not sure why, I thought it went pretty well...) and another wants me to start tomorrow.  
The money is pretty good - usually around £10/hr, you get a combination of cash on the night and weekly pay, and really it's just spending a few hours driving round listening to podcasts.

Then I used way less but after a while I felt like I was going nowhere and aimed for total sobriety. I thought I was going to get more support and the lack thereof in any kind of progress made me want to use more. So now I’m pretty much back to the basics: shitload of benzodiazepines, dope and a lil coke here and there.

So my question is: do you think we have to embrace our addiction fully in order to hope reaching sobriety?(basically getting rid of any guilt about using is what I mean)

It might seem counterintuitive but as I’ve never wanted so much to be sober I’m fucked up all the time and when i let go I seem to use way less...

Do you slowly and consistently push the needle in until you register? Or do you do something different? (saw this guy who would lightly tap on the end of his plunger until he was registered. .. It made my skin crawl). 

Do you wait until you're in the vein to pull the plunger back to see if you registered, or before you try to hit, do you leave a little air in the syringe near the tip so the blood just flows in and so you don't risk slipping out of the vein if it's tiny? (btw if there is a bubble in the syringe, you won't die lol... Old myth and it takes way more air than just a little bit to fuck you up). 

Do you always wash your injection site with alcohol pads or something of the sorts, prior to AND after injecting or do you choose to do one or the other, instead of both.. ?


Do you have a specific tie off or something of the likes that you constantly have on you? Or do you just use whatever the fuck you can (guilty as charged). 

Last question!

I always pull my tie off, off of my arm or from wherever before I pull the rig out of the vein I just shot into. I've heard it helps from letting blood pool up under the skin becayse of the pressure, but I'm not sure if it holds any value to it lol.

But yesterday he had us go somewhere completely different, and when we get off the interstate, I realise that we're really close to my hometown.

When we get to the spot we're supposed to wait at, my dad points out to me the road we're on. It's the actual fucking road that leads to our old house and everything. Memories start flooding in. I get lost in nostalgia.

Then my guy pulls through and says to follow him. We do, and end up doing the deal just a couple streets over from our old house. Un-fucking-believable. It felt so strange being on those streets again doing what we were doing. I never dreamed I would be back in that little city 15 years later scoring heroin. It was surreal. 

Anyway, after we do the deal, we go to the road that runs in front of the airport to sit and do our lines. We used to go there when I was a kid and sit on the hood or trunk of our car and watch the airplanes take off and land. Even spotted a UFO once hovering above the airport when I was about 9 years old.

So, we snort our lines and then decide to go and explore the old neighborhood and drive by our house, my old school, all the places I remember from my childhood. It was a nice little trip down memory lane for us. But it was also really bizarre to be there as an adult doing heroin right around the corner from my childhood home. My dad felt weird about it too because he used to take my mom to meet her crack dealer in the same area, so it was like some weird deja vu to him.

Much better than subs in every way,"I'm done with oxy. Hate the feeling now. I only started it because it was hyped and my first experience with it in 2010 10mg produced and amazing euphoria. But overall hydrocodone has always been better.

Basically I snorted up to 240mg blues a day or IVD up to 3 blues In a shot.

IVing in the morning produces somewhat of a ""rush"" although it's very mild.

Subs are garbage.

But hydrocodone even a small amount takes away withdrawals and knock on wood I wake up the next day with no cravings for either.

Amazing that oxy and hydro are different by just a single oxygen atom that oxycodone has more yet the effects are vastly different. At least for me hydrocodone feels more ""natural"" and withdrawals are no where near as bad as oxy.

Hopefully this will keep me off blues forever. Done with oxy the high is garbage in retrospect anyway. Only liked it at first because I liked snorting things.

Now fuk opana too because it's a metabolite of oxycodone but I'm getting some metabolites of hydrocodone aka hydromorphone for Thanksgiving and gonna iv 3-4mg and have a great day.

It's odd even 40-50mg hydrocodone feels like 150-180mg oxycodone. Even 150mg tramadol a while back felt strong. New chemicals tend to always feel stronger for me because I'm not used to it. I'm tapering hydrocodone anywhere from 7-14 days with a few dilaudid shots in between 😇. Wish me luck.

But oxy, that I want done for sure no matter what..horrible drug that it makes me irritated, angry. Yell at friends or family sometimes and can't cum for shit. I can cum no problem even on 80mg hydrocodone and feel as high on that amount as 200mg oxy.

I've been off this subreddit for several months up until the past week due to being sober, but I ended up relapsing cus I was bored pretty much. Anywayyy, back when I frequented this sub there was a thread everyday about copping and i thought it was pretty cool, so I decided to post one today. I recently started using again so I still have a low tolerance but yesterday I copped a half g and after leaving work today I still had about a quarter g so I decided to cop a full g, for 120 and it's pretty good stuff, so I won't have to pick up for a few days. My plug met me within 30 mins of hitting him up (love my plug) and I got home, changed into my sweatpants and got nice a comfy and just railed almost the entire quarter g (up until now I've been doing like .1 at the most to get me comfortably high) so needless to say in a few mins I'm gonna be nodding my dick off. 

So, what is your guy's opinion on the most efficient way to get high when snorting; doing smaller doses every hour or two or large doses every several hours? Also what are you all getting into today? Any exciting copping stories? Whatever you're doing today talk about it here, I'd  love to hear about your days and reacquaint myself with the community :).

I did about 5 last night. I sniffed one full one (felt it but I hate the drip also gave me a slight headache) then I tried to shoot one rectally. I kinda fucked the first one up so I did a second one that I also wasted 15% of. Then i ate 2. This was over the course of a night and I was high as fuck. 

I have a 80mg Oxycodone daily habit. 5 - 8mg hydromorph's did the trick but I also ate 40mg of oxy along with it. 

Is there any advice you guys can give me for shorting rectally? What I did was crush up the pill and put it in the top of the oral syringe then put my finger on the bottom whole. I then put the plunger in untill the powder was compressed. Then I ""drew"" up a bit of water and flicked the oral synringe so it would mix, then I shot it into my asshole lol if that the correct way? It was my first time. I never got a ""rush"" I don't think (if I'm saying I don't think then I obvs didn't right?) but I did feel high as fuck and warm 30 min afterward. 

Sniffing was alright but I hate the drip. Eating it was very good lol I like eating my opiates the most. I know a lot of you will say I was wasting drugs cause I add the hydromorph's but they kick in quickly and are tiny pills they hit hard for me. 

It's also worth noting that this is my first time actually getting faded/high off of hydromorphone. Every other time they sucked. 

Any advice on how i can get the most out of them? I got 17-8mg pms-hydromorphone for 100$, is that good ?

I made a massive effort this year to kick it for good and made it 6 months before a lapse and back on it around the end of July. I tried not to disappoint them and kept it a secret but I am useless at hiding it, they can see me high a mile away and I'm terrible at cleaning up paraphernalia etc.

Anyway, around September in an effort to make an effort - I was going for job interviews and somehow I managed to land an unbelievable job of a lifetime with incredible pay, amazing prospect and it is for one of the top 100 companies in the UK.

However, I was still using. A little in the morning to get through work unnoticed and a little in the evening to sleep.

They found out of course and I spent the last 2 weekends trying to go cold turkey and make it to work on Monday - failing every time. I have been forced to take a few days off work sick when unable to score - in the last 3 months of work, I've missed 10 days of work and my 'Bradford score' (score of how disruptive my taking sick time has been to the company) has surpassed the maximum allowed score of 100 and hit over 250!

I had to have a disciplinary meeting at work and I was asked if I'd been to the doctor (luckily I went to see if I could get help multiple times, so I have plenty of doctors attendance notes. The GPs and the Drug clinic have been FUCKING USELESS, to the point where I wrote a 15 page letter to my local Member of Parliament to complain about how hard it is to get help for drug issues if you aren't homeless and actually have a real job because the clinic is only open between 9-5pm weekdays. Useless for me. But the whole complaint about doctors, the government and drug help in the UK is in another monstrously long ranting post I made elsewhere!)

I'm now under review at work. I don't want to lose this job. (Rather amusingly, one of the questions my manager had to ask was 'Have I been drinking too much and do I have a problem, because I always seem to take Monday's off! I had to laugh.)

My mum came to me on my Birthday on Saturday and said - I can see you've been desperate to quit and put real effort into it, you haven't snuck off or stolen money, you've locked yourself in and been sick for days trying to kick it and just haven't had the time to complete the withdrawal. I don't want you to lose this job - it could be the ticket to the rest of your life if you can kick this awful habit. I agreed.

So, off her own back, she has offered to pay for as much dope as I need for the next month until I can get to Christmas, where I can book all the holiday I have coming to me at work and take 5 days, a weekend, Christmas and boxing day - a total of 11 days off. Which should easily be enough to kick it through the peak primary physical withdrawals enough to go to work afterwards unaided and just get better day by day from there. 

As long as I'm completely honest, don't take the piss (use too much) and make it another month until I have the time to quit properly, I'm supplied until then.

A totally fair deal if you ask me.

However, she insist I smoke it as she doesn't want me injecting. To be honest, I've run out of places that are easy to inject anyway so I had moved to boofing for the last week anyway. 

I've tried smoking it. It does stop withdrawals but there is NO hit, NO high and only seems to take the edge off. I still feel a bit hot and uncomfortable, but hey. It's better than nothing..

So.. Junkie Jesus rides in and saves the day for an entire month. I know I'll have to quit, but at least I don't have to panic every day knowing I need to get money, find a dealer and hide it from everyone.

This past weekend she drove me round 3 different dealers and we stocked up on hundred of quids worth of gear. It's all in my parents safe right now, I just need to ask for it when I need it.

I'd like to pin it, but if I miss or can't find a vein, it'll be a waste and I'll be forced to boof. If that doesn't work either, I'll be sick, so I do kinda have to stick to the plan and smoke it - they roughly know my schedule  of when I get sick (every 6-12 hours) so I can't ask for much more. If only I had veins left for this last month! Hey, maybe its a sign its time to kick this shit once and for good like I've been trying.",1511200594.0

So, in 6 months of daily use my tolerance grow up fucking much, I started with codeine, one week later I tried oxy, after that I was hooked, best feeling in my hole life, started using everyday, one time per day, every night to be more specific, oxy started to be very expensive, I switched to morphine sulphate, because is more cheaper where I live. The only ones avaiable here are these 3, plus methadone and tramadol. Tramadol sucks, so I never really bought it, I tried once, and it sucked hahaha. So my tolerance that started on 10mg oxy, is now 200mg of morphine everyday when I get back home, I wait like 24h between my doses. I am having money problems these days, and methadone is the cheaper than every other avaiable for me, so can I use methadone to save some money, like if I take the dose when I start feeling withdrawal in the night, can I skip the other day without getting sick, and after 48h do my usual morphine dose? if I do that, I can save at least one day of morphine. I am already doing my dose with benzos to use less and get more of the pills, but fuck I dont wanna get hooked to benzos too, I abused them this whole week.Can I use methadone to save some money? or it will be worse? And if I decide to stop, whats the best way to taper in home? with morphine or with dones? thanks! It started nice, all night I got high, but today the high is pretty much to not be dopesick, I need to stop. thanks!",1511349689.0

I don’t mean to be a downer and just pass this by if it bums you out too much but I’m out of my mind depressed and have been for weeks. Well, years and years if I’m being honest but the latest bout has lasted almost two weeks straight. 

I haven’t gotten out of bed except to piss or grab some bites of food but i do so when I know everyone else in the house is asleep so I don’t have to see them. This is my MO when I’m like this. I haven’t seen the sun or had fresh air in about 9 days and all I want to do is sleep. Even when I’m having nightmares it feels so much better than being awake, I actually enjoy them. Like fun little interactive movies. 

The longest I’ve gone just laying in bed is 3 weeks and I feel like I’m well on my way to surpassing that now. 

I’m not using right now. Trying to not even drink. This seems to happen the hardest when I try to get sober. I like that I’m not using every day but it is obviously not a healthy trade off if the only thing I do when I’m not using is sleep and avoid the sun and people and the only time I’m energetic and productive is when I’m high. 

Anyone else? I think I just want to talk to someone right now and I’m at the point where anonymous strangers over the internet on a drug forum will do. 

I do watch a  lot of comedy. And I get way nostalgic. I wish it was 1992-1996 every day forever. Anyone else?

None of these shots were misses either, I registered and reregistered halfway thru and everything, they were good shots.

So I had over 8 months clean and sober and decided to relapse. Wasn’t going to get dope bc I’m on probation for another 3 months with urine tests often. I loved u4 tho before I got sober and honestly planned to chip, but we all know how that usually ends up. Anyways, got the u4 (4g of it) and waited til night time to use it. 

Drove to my local pharmacy to buy some saline nasal spray to help my sinus a little bit bc this shit is caustic. Decided to do a tiny bump of u4 in my car before going inside, to test the waters. I ended up doing 2 small little bumps without weighing anything out. I had taken bumps of it before but I was clean for 8 months prior and I had zero tolerance to opies at this point. I know this was stupid to do, but I thought I could handle it bc really they were tiny bumps, smaller than what I would do before wth other batches. This batch must have been way more potent.

I start feeling really good and begin to walk into the pharmacy to buy the saline. I quickly realized it was too much, it kept getting stronger and stronger as I go into the store and walk to the aisle with nasal sprays. I knew I took too much, I started to lose my balance and my vision started to go a bit blurry. 

I get to the cough/allergy aisle and look for the saline spray, but my vision got mor and more blurry and I couldn’t focus on anything and couldn’t see what I was looking for or read any text on any products. My balance got worse and worse to the point where I could no longer stand straight. From here my memory goes pretty cloudy.

I started swaying hard from side to side trying to stand straight. Bumped into the shelves behind/in front of me a few times. Ended up on my knees and knew I was fucked at this point and knew I had ODd.

Next thing I know there’s a bunch of paramedics around me calling my name. I was very confused and disoriented, it felt like I was dreaming. They loaded me onto a stretcher and started to take me out to the ambulance. I realized what was happening and was no longer confused, so I tried to get off the stretcher and tried to tell them that I refuse any treatment bc they said they were calling my mom and I’m on thin ice with her and I’m on probation so I didn’t want to be found out that I relapsed.

They said I was unconscious and not breathing for several minutes before they got to me. My heart rate was at 180bpm now and my mom showed up to the ambulance and they convince me to go to the hospital and get treated. I then spend a few hours in th ER and eventually go home, somehow thought of a lie to cover up using u4. Denied taking any drugs and even asked them to test me for proof (knowing u4 doesn’t show up on drug screens). 

Fucking shit...

My friend had found some old percocets he was prescribed in his moms cabinet, and i bought them all of him (he not into that). 

I tell my fiend friends and they’re all over me the whole day unti it’s 7th period and my friend and I decide to skip it the period. We escape the school and start walking to another friends house, who wasn’t there but he said he had some bud that we could take. 

He fucking lied to us and there was no bud and he said “his brother took it” (complete lie). Luckily I had some weed back home but it’s like a 45 minutes walk to there from where we were but we said fuck it and started walking. 

So he knew I had the percs on me (5 mg pills) and I had 4 of them. I thought I had 5 and I was planning on taking three and giving two to my friend, but after I took the three I noticed there was only one left so that confused me, but he didn’t really care so I just gave it to him. We popped em on the sidewalk and headed for my house.

I really started feeling it after about 35 minutes and I get the weed and we go back to his house to smoke. Laying down can enhance the opiate high immensely so I’m laying on the couch and I start to feel really good, much better than walking. We smoke and then lay back on the couch. Immediately after the hit, I felt super cloudy in my head and I couldn’t put any words together and could barely walk, and probably looked retarded in front of him cause he wasn’t as fucked up as me.

I lay on the couch and just pure euphoria hits me. Just simply staring at the window was pure bliss, one of the best highs I’ve ever had. Weed and oxycodone are a match made in heaven in my opinion. I was totally nodding hard and one second I was talking to him and the next I was asleep and he was like “dude are you okay” haha.

Been very busy lately and haven't been too active on here. Day 31 without heroin is wrapping up and day 32 begins in just a few hours. Today my thoughts seamlessly drifted into getting a point or two and just gettin high for the day. It'd feel great, I'd get to buy off my new friend, and I'm sure I have rigs hidden around here somewhere. Then tomorrow forget it ever happened. 

Then I thought myself, ""wait what the fuck am I doing. Bad recovering addict, bad recovering addict. No no."" It took a few tries to snap myself out of it. Heroin is a bad bitch, which I'm unfortunately into, but she has some hooks, that's for sure. Seems today those hooks gave me the room I needed to feel a little comfy and let my guard down then BOOM that bitch tryin to snag me again. Don't get me wrong, thoughts of using cross my mind all the time, as I expect so early in recovery. But I was seriously and genuinely considering it today and it was so easy to get caught up in it without noticing, seemed like any old smooth flowing thought process. Blended right in. 

It's fucking terrifying. You guys I seriously cannot let myself touch that shit again, and realistically the odds are completely stacked against me. Like fuck.

So I got arrested and went to jail for 30days for driving without a license. 


When I was arrested I had 2 whole 8mg strips on me.  Which (luckily) my arresting officer gave to me since I was going to be held over the weekend before getting arrainged. I would make these 2 strips last me the next week or so. 

On day one I took much more than necessary. My main concern was ensuring that I felt OK, and while taking more Sub did not exactly mean that I was continuing to improve my state, I dosed excessively and without a thought about my long-term plan....I just wanted to make sure I was well right then and there. 

The following day I took 2mg in the morning, and probably another 1mg around 6pm that evening. It's probably worth noting at this point that my method of taking the Suboxone is through plugging. I use this method for the higher returns.  I cannot verify the effectiveness myself...but it definitely works to somd degree, and it also helps  to play a mental mindgame for myself. Allowing me to take a smaller dose ans believing that I had actually ingested a significant dose as a result of the much higher bioavailability. 

So for reference my dosing went something like this :

Day 1 Friday: 4mg at ~7pm (I'm about 30hrs since last dose).
Day 2 Saturday: 2mg at ~9am. Additional 1mg at ~6pm.
Day 3 Sunday: 2mg at ~9am.

Monday is a big day for me. I thought I would be getting released today, which would mean I could go cop some DOPE. 

...but NOPE. I get remanded.  It's worth mentioning  that I'm not going to jail for driving without a license...I'm actually in trouble for Defaulting on the court date. Being that I'm an addict, I can never afford my court fines, so I will stupidly Default on the court date. I have blown the courts off many times...then I'll get arrested down the road...bail out,  and blow off the court dates all over again. This time there was no bail. And they were not going to let me out without teaching me a lesson. 

Day 4 Monday: once I find out I'm not going home, I take 1mg around 6pm.
Day 5 Tuesday 2mg at ~6am.
Day 6 Wednesday: 1mg at ~6am. And an additional  1mg at ~7pm
Day 7 Thursday: 1mg at ~6am
Day 8 Friday: Today all that was left was a very tiny sliver of my strip; likely less than 1mg. I took the last of it that morning around 6am.

All while I was taking the Suboxone, I was sleeping at night, but I would wake up several times throughout the night. Waking up probably 3 or 4 times,  and waking up for good around 5-6am. I had sweaty palms, chronic sneezing, and I was having loose stool but it was manageable. 

Once the subs ran out I was panicking real bad that my symptoms would get worse, and likely even some new ones would present themselves and I would  just be in full blown withdrawals. 

BUT, the sickness never came. I had some anxiety of course...but I had the energy to socialize, my sleep remained the same...which wasn't ideal...but the fact that I was able to sleep at all...even if I'm frequently waking up, is not a bad scenario. Days turn into weeks and I realize I'm over the hump. 

I think that the stresses associated with jail helped to take my mind away and make it so that my withdrawal wasn't the sole and main focus of my existence, which made things MUCH easier than I had anticipated. 

Another factor is that I dosed Suboxone in low doses for a few days to get through the very worst of the sickness.  

I had used a short-term suboxone taper under different circumstances with similar results. However, I did eventually relapse that time.  


I've now been out for 6days and have not yet relapsed. Too early to tell if I finally got my shit together, but I have a feeling things are going to work out well.  


I'll post updates for a couple days. 


TL;DR: went to jail for 30days and detoxed. Nearly NO withdrawal.  Still clean 6days after getting out. ",1511319193.0

7enfqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7enfqx/my_story/,10,https://redd.it/7enfqx,Gulb180,My story,"Hey guys,
I’ve used this sub a lot for info on opiates and dosages and whatnot and i would like to share my story for others to be wary/ compare stores. So pretty much my opiate usage started in January of this year. My dad had had severe back injuries and therefore accumulated thousands of Norco (hydro10/apap325). I started small, few at a time nothing crazy as to have my dad not notice but after a while, ran out and stopped for a while. One day upon searching i found a large large storage of pills my dad had hidden and went to town. I quickly ended up 24 pills a day for about 3 months until i ran out. As i was running out my parents discovered my usage and talked to me and since i was out of pills it was time to stop. Now there were still some left that i was going to use on occasion when home from college. This happened multiple times and went well taking around 10 pills and having it go alright. Well, last Friday night i had taken 10 norco 3 oxy snorted and 3 tramadol. Next thing i know I’m in the hospital apparently I had puked while knocked out, inhaled the puke, had cpr done on me, and ambulanced to the emergency room. 4 days later, i am still in th hospital recovering from my pneumonia. My time here has been alright but the psychiatrist lady had been pissing me off trying to tell me what i think and feel and not believeing me when i tell her I’m not severely depressed. I’m being sent to outpatient paychiatric help. This is completely unnecessary because 1. I had no intention to harm anyone or myself it was a complete accident 2. It was a 1 time dose and I’m not hooked at all. This is a long story but I’d just like to share with everyone here thanks !",1511317767.0

 Fuk blues. Overrated and expensive garbage with a weird mental high that ha me agitated and absolutely can't cum plus you can't really get a rush  from banging and also it's a lot more addictive and harder to get off than hydromorphone or hydrocodone.

Look at the news and the country. What are they mostly addicted to when it  comes to  opiates?

Number 1 is dope and number 2 is oxycodone and number 3 is probably hydrocodone but it's so far down from oxy and dope by miles. I don't know the hype of oxy. I started doing oxy because of the hype over norcos and you could snort it without apap and got terribly dependent and addicted.

I can safely say and knock on wood that hydrocodone and dilaudid don't make me crave the next day plus thr come down us so amazing. Oxycodone come down feels like shit and just overall very bad which is why people are so terribly hooked on it.

Im glad to be off it.

I still don't fully understand if, how and precisely why my ""friend"" Cliff screwed me out of $190 the night of pay day. At this point I'm just assuming he pulled some kind of shenanigans because it's in his nature as established by his track record.


&nbsp;

I'd like to take a moment to Chronicle the day this happened with a higher level of precision. I owed 15 blues to Cliff on Thursday's pay day so I pulled money from the ATM, and Cliff went to his guy to get 20 blues. He gets 15, I get 5. Some times he'll snort one blue but other times during this day he'll snort two at the same time as I've observed twice.


Later that evening, I'm on my way home from work and I answer my phone where he presents a proposition. For the days leading up to pay day and the week prior he kept mentioning how he has a friend who has a Suboxone script. This friend no longer uses dope but has a brother who does. The Sub connect would sell us a bunch of subs at a discount as long as we bought at least 20. 


&nbsp;


Being that I had $190 left after buying the blues and settling my debt from the days prior with Cliff I was planning on spending no more than $100 on subs. I didn't care about getting a bulk discount since even five subs would last me quite a while especially if I tapered down between this and next week. On the days leading up to pay day Cliff kept mentioning about his friend and the bulk discount and how it would be great to have all of these subs for the holidays. It's an easy sell because he knows I put importance on not being dopesick when visiting family on Christmas as an example.


**Sidenote** - Last Christmas I made a spreadsheet to ensure that I did not run out of dope when visiting my relative's house for a feast.

&nbsp;


Okay so that Thursday evening on pay day after already copping I put forth my last $190. I get 1/2 a bun and Cliff indicates that he bought two more buns to give to his sub connect who would in turn give those two buns to his brother. Come Friday afternoon he claims that the sub connect's brother came over at 7AM to pick up the 2 buns of dope (the sub connect was originally supposed to show up at that time) with the promise that the sub connect would show up later.

&nbsp;

By the time I showed up on Friday afternoon to get the bad news Cliff was laying in his bed as he does on days when he runs out of dope and is experiencing the early stages of withdrawal. So at first I thought maybe his BS story was true because he didn't have enough time to do two buns and get dope sick. 


Heck, even his text messages on Friday morning were in sync with the appointed times. It appeared as though he did stay up and wait for his friend to deliver the subs. 


* 6:30AM - ""he's coming"" 

* 7:30AM - ""he's coming shortly I'll alert you when he does.""

* 11:00AM - ""He'll be here before one, I lost it on the phone before. My mother was so scared because I SNAPPED at him and we ARE getting extra.""

* 12:30 PM - ""I'm waiting ofr him now I'll text you when it's here""

* 1:15 PM -- Upon me asking if the guy is enroute, response is: I hope so he said a few minutes after 1pm and I just asked as you texted me""

* 2:00 PM -- I ask again if he's coming, ""wiating for that answer""

* 2:02 PM - ""His last text he said he left his house""

* 2:27 PM - After more of my short inquiring, ""I have window open I'm just closing my eyes til he arrives. He's coming in when here dont' worry""

* 2:28 PM - ""I'm pouring sweat""

* 2:29 PM -- ""ok well I'll either have a bunch of subs or a bun if he don't show"" (at this point it's my understanding that Cliff is still hodling on to 2 buns of H as part of the trdade for the subs)

* 2:30 PM - ""He's shwoing I'd bet my bun on it ! Did you take your last bit of sub?"" (I had less than 1mg of sub left, I did take it and wasn't going to shate it anyway -- I shared 1mg of sub with cliff the other day an hour before his dboy delivered, had I not I woudl've had 2mg of sub!)

* 2:31 PM - ""I'll be texting you shortly watch""

* 3:15 PM -- I say I can't believe there's no update. Cliff responds, ""I'm waiting anxiously trust me""

* 3:17 PM -- I state that I'm giving it until 5pm then I'll come thru in person for an update. Cliff says, ""ok I'm praying and will text you before then""

* 3:28 PM -- I indicate that I'll arive after I take a shower. His response, ""text me before you come please""

* 4:29 PM - **""I fucked up dude. We have to decide what to do.""** In my mind, fuck... This.

Maybe I'm a smug asshole but my response to that was ""Well, admission is the first step. I'll be over soon I'm getting dressed."" Then finally I indicated I Was on my way.

&nbsp;

Upon my arrival Cliff says ""the sub connect's brother came at 7:30AM, picked up the dope."" He also indicated that the Sub connect stopped answering his phone at 2:30 PM. Now based on the text messages listed above, there is no indication that the sub connect's brother came to pick up the dope so it's hard to believe it as truth.

There didn't seem to be enough time to do 15 blues + 2.5 buns. He only picked up the H Thursday evening on the same day he picked up 15 blues. Even if he burned through all 15 blues by 9PM It's difficult to believe.

Maybe a good part of the money went towards paying for thanksgiving dinner to get his mom off his back?


&nbsp;

I cant' be certain if I was lied to or not, but in the past Cliff said that he was in contact with a sub connect but when I went to speak to that sub connect they said ""no, he has not messged or called me at all about needing to get subs."" So that time I spent my money on dope for him and I with the understanding that he had money set aside for subs but he did not. Due to that instance of lying and others before it... even in this situation where It's really hard to figure at what point in time he engaged in foul play I feel inclined to exercise caution and to look out for myself.

&nbsp;

When Cliff gave me the bad news on Friday in person, he gave me $20. He calimed that he, ""found it in my other pocket.""


On saturday morning he asked for the money back to buy dope on credit that he'd share with me. I insisted on not doing that but I couldn't guarantee being able to get subs that day and since he already called the house phone I went ahead and gave the $20 back just to quiet him. Coincidentally, his dope guy delivered at the same time the sub connect asked me if I needed anything.


&nbsp;

Took the off work on Saturday then found a way to earn subs on Sunday. At that point I didn't share because I want to make sure I can get through a long week which includes Black Friday in retail. 


Sometimes I think he's allergic to subs. Today and yesterday he's asking if I had any luck in getting subs yet. I keep lying and giving postponements as he has done to me in the past. 


I don't get it.... but my best buess is he has no foresight and is selfish. Doesn't do the logical thing of getting subs for after a dope binge until it's too late. Suddenly he cares about getting subs whem all other options for getting dope are exhausted.


&nbsp;

It's bullshit like this that has me at wit's end, and is the reason why I scheduled an appointment to see a doctor to put this lifestyle behind me. I refuse to be conned out of my money before Christmas. I need to buy presents for family members and not have to lie through my teeth. I also need to invest in upgrades for my ride.


&nbsp;

I provided a detailed account of the messages from Friday morning and afternoon to see if there's anyone who thinks I was **not** scammed. I'm assuming I was based on history but if not for that I would've believed in his story and given a portion of any subs I obtained this week.",1511295266.0

What I need to know is how often/how much sub do I need to keep in my system to not have to start the whole thing over? 
Yesterday I took 3 whole 8mg throughout the day. My last at about 7pm. And only smoked maybe 3-4 points mostly last night over a few hours.  (I actually did even feel it a little bit 👍🏻) I've taken no subs today. 
Would like 2mg in am and in pm keep enough in my system that I don't have to start induction again? 
I know this is a horrible way to do it. I know I'll have to pay the piper at some point. But I need to get through thanksgiving with the extended family first. ",1511294827.0

Yay.","Back in August I posted in this sub and got a ton of support as I was going through a rather painful withdrawal after a year of daily use. I stayed clean for 21 days.  

I wanted to be sober for a trip to Iceland I was taking for a variety of reasons - I was going to be alone with my family for the first time in a year, I was going to be experiencing something I didn't want to forget, I didn't want the hassle of traveling with illegal shit - you get the point. 

But the day I got home I dosed. I fucking got home, brought my suitcase up the steps and went to the medicine cabinet. I stared at the pills for maybe 30 seconds wondering what the fuck I was doing. I poured a pill into my hand, stared a little longer and then tossed it back. 

Since then I've been on a binge, back to 90mg of roxy or more a day. Fuck it feels so good. God damn I hate how good it makes me feel, how nothing - *nothing* can make me feel that way. Nothing makes the anxiety and depression go away, nothing helps me sleep better. I hate this drug but mostly I hate how much I love it. I hate how much I feel like it ""helps"" me.

So now my plug is dry and I'm back on day 2 of sobriety. Fuck my life how can the w/d be worse after a 3 month binge than a full year of use? But it is. It's worse. 

Plug says I'll have 25 pills tomorrow, which will be day 3. I'm telling myself I'll try not to dose but the truth is I know I'm going to fucking eat them as soon as I have them in my hands. And then what? 

A few days later I'll be right back where I am today. What an asshole I am. I don't know if I can live a sober life anymore. Not a happy one, anyway. 

Anyway, rant over. Sorry for the shit post but you guys are literally the only people on the planet I have to talk to about this shit since not a soul knows about my habit. I feel so defeated and desperate. ",1511291342.0

I happened to be crossing the street to go to the liquor store that's right by my complex. I see a girl I recognize on the way back. Someone who I know is best friends with my old manager who I'm very close with. She and I start bitching about the ""new"" manager. Douche fuck stole some of my pills about a year ago. I tell her that and we're just having a lil bitchfest. So next day I'm walking and doing God knows what at my complex, I can't remember. I see my maintenance guy. He's probably the kindest person you'll ever meet. He has child that is special needs like mine so he and I talk a lot. We start talking about something and the neighbor comes up. He trips out because she had told him the story about the manager steal pills and my maintenance guy makes a joke that he'd ask to buy them.  We laugh and then start talking about how his brother just died and he's trying to figure out to get him cremated. I know someone people who know what to do. So I tell him I'm gonna look it up for him. An hour later I knock on the door to a unit he's remodeling and have all the  details he needs to have his brother cremated. Dude gives me a big hug and cries. Let me paint you a picture of this man. He's maybe about 5'10, thick grayish blond beard, bandana, rides a beautiful red bike not sure the maker, and he's friends with hells angels. But he will give you the shirt off his back or he'll shoot the shit with you, and he loves kids and his wife has authored a children's story. He also is a smart ass who sends his ex child support of $666 every month. I fucking adore this guy! I've known him for 4+ years. He asks me if he owes me anything  aka ""pills"". I tell him no, that I'm ok right now but if ever comes a time where I need to buy some maybe he can help.  This last week I needed to get some, sure enough my guy comes through and helps me out. Makes a joke not to tell anyone, I tell him you don't tell on me I won't snitch on you 😉 he catches my husband in passing a lil later and asks if we have any coffee. I walk my lil ass over there with steaming hot coffee and some creamer. He asks me again if he owes us anything. I tell him, ""no, We're friends and you don't owe us anything. I don't charge my friends. But keep me updated on the situation with your brother, because I care."" 
I kid you not, the next day he knocks on my door and hands me a signed copy of the book his wife wrote. I already absolutely love it!

So kids, that's how I met another connect 😘😘😘
