3a1m7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3a1m7z/subutex_for_detox/,5,https://redd.it/3a1m7z,dyirs,Subutex for detox,"So I have been a casual heroin user for >10 years but always avoided any habit by only smoking on weekends etc. BUT my wife left me about 6 weeks ago and I was not so careful. I have been going at 90% of the time since then smoking~0.2-0.3g of good quality gear per day. I tried to stop about 2 days ago but was pretty uncomfortable and work was a nightmare. 

I want to stop again and be able to work so i was thinking about getting some subbies in for days 2-5 to make it more bearable and get some sleep in normal sleeping hours e.g. not 2pm in the afternoon. Having no experience of subbies I am in need of some advice from the community (i do not want to go near a doc's as there is no history of drug use in records and a shame to spoil that!). 

What strength should i get in and should i does once or twice a day? I do not want to use more than 3/4 days at max. Is it safe to take valium at same time to grab some sleep? 

All advice is appreciated

This was the last time I was supposed to use and now I have to move or worse. LVPD barely missed me. I left a perfect bloody print on the roll of toilet paper. Even I would have been disgusted. The clear barrel and bent needles with the barbed ends. I had even been exchanging one plunger between the two of them, because I was supposed to stop. Goddammit. I'm always so careful and the dope wasn't even that good. I want to run and hide in a corner with my paraphernalia. The old man couldn't talk to me without shaking and I'm sure he saw my room while I was at work. I was going to move anyway, but goddamn. I just can't help but be a fuck up. It's in my blood. I will always be 5 minutes late, rushing through the door with a look of shame on my face. Disheveled and messy, disorganized. A hard worker, but unreliable. Reliability is what it all comes down to in the end and I'm the polar opposite. You can't rely on me for anything, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to come through. I will be there at opportune times to give you a cigarette, a dime, or a dollar. I don't steal. I'll always pay you back unless you're my parents, and I'm generous with my space and drugs. I get ripped off, but not often. I always have a hustle, and I'm almost never without money but I always feel broke. It's been raining a lot lately and the clouds have only gotten darker. Figuratively of course. All the shit I thought I out ran for a while gained on me at the same time. Maybe the Phytoplankton Super Plus 1000 I'm currently hawking to dementia patients will help me be a better human being. I'm getting too old to be doing this shit. Using is one thing, but fuck, learn some responsibility. Stop being such a fuck up. I'm giving junkies a bad name. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I so defective? My mom stopped buying new sweaters because 
I couldn't help but leave every one of them behind. But in my defense, she dropped me on my head, the bitch. My memory sucks so I pour benzos and booze on top of it. Don't worry though, not at the same time, generally. Benzos during the day and booze at night. Gotta love the USA. I just hope I make it to work tomorrow before anyone shows up to kick me out or arrest me. Will they go that far? Probably. I think i got all of my shit collected but I'm keeping my goddamn weed. fuck me. I should have had another 6 days to find a place. What the fuck does he mean by ""they're having it analyzed, tested to see what was in it, finger prints and all that"". Is this some CSI shit to catch the junky?  How long does this process take? Will the cops
actually care? Will the landlord press charges? I can't ask 
any of these questions, but I know they know the answer. I 
know they know it's me. Fuck. I've already burned down all 
the weekly's, so I can't run there. Maybe they won't 
remember me? Maybe they've forgotten about the trashed studios left in a hurry and behind on rent? Am I in denial? Seems like a long shot. I didn't think I was even that far gone, but everything has turned to shit. I thought I had some semblance of control. I did...I do...right? I mean, I really am trying, I was clean for so long. Something's supposed to happen, I just have no idea what  it is. Could be good in the end I guess, it wouldn't be the first time. I just wanted to be able to look my family in the eye this time. I just wanted to actually have a job and be going to school. I wanted to buy a new dress. And now I have to wear the mask with nothing behind it. And also hope I don't get arrested. Oh well.

My family laughed at her, told her there was no fucking way, countered with claims that she was just a crazy druggie (which she's admitted to being in the past lol), and dismissed it all. If they have any doubts about it all, they haven't been expressed. Only one person even considered it -- and only did so by saying, ""I think [ex] is a lying crazy bitch, but I hope that if you were ever struggling with something like heroin addiction you'd feel safe coming to us for help. We love you, and we'll love you either way. Nobody could say anything to us to change that, and nothing you are or could be could change that either.""

The thing is, I am very much addicted to heroin and have been for about a year. Prior to that I spent the better part of a year/year and a half heavily abusing pills, and have an even longer history of opiate abuse that goes back into my early teens. My addiction and drug abuse has always, for the most part, been fairly well managed in that it hasn't caused any major conflict or issue for me or those around me. I've never been arrested, I've pretty much always paid for all of my own shit (and when I didn't.. well, I never got caught stealing), I'm intelligent & hard working, and have managed to find success in school and the workplace, etc. I don't look or act like your typical junkie, I get fucked up in my own space and function  doped out pretty much 100% of the time.. but I am so so baffled by the entire situation.

I guess I should be happy that I got away with it, because it's really some fucking luck to be confronted with something like that and have nothing come of it, but I'm really just perplexed. I think part of me would have welcomed an open & honest conversation about just how fucked up my life has gotten.. It's tiring to always pretend to be something you're not, tiring to always be pretending that you're doing better than you are, etc.

About an hour after the hit I made a cup of tea and realised I couldn't face drinking it so headed up to my bed.

Was in bed and started getting short breathe and a bit shaky. Having this happen before it was obvious what was happening.

After about 5 minutes the intense migraine started and I was completely immobilized by it, couldn't move in complete distress. feeling hot and cold, sweating / shaking. I fell asleep at this point and woke up about 15 minutes later with the migraine in full effect and the nausea just kicking in. Made my way to the bathroom and vomited solidly for about half an hour feeling like I was going to shit myself the whole time.

After that finished I got a jug for being sick in at my bedside because I knew it wouldn't be over for at lest 12 hours.

I was in bed being sick to the point where everything had come out so your body throws up the lining of your stomach, I kept drinking water to try and stop this happening but as soon as I had swallowed it I threw it up again 5 seconds later.

I fell asleep for 15 minutes again woke up and felt like I was going to shit myself again so I had to go to the toilet. I stood up out of bed and my legs couldn't carry my weight and my arms began to violently spasm involuntary. I collapsed 3 times walking the 8 feet to the toilet and am unsure how I got back to my feet each time.

I used the toilet which was horribly painful and halfway through I needed to turn around and vomit more stomach lining which was a horrible experience in itself.

Made my way back to my room and collapsed coming through the door and laid there completely immobalised for a little while. Eventually got up and into my bed and fell asleep for about 6 hours. I got up and needed to use the bathroom again and realised I had shit myself in my sleep.

I could have stayed home again, but I got some credit for going in not looking great. Boss knew I was actually sick on Friday then and not just looking for a 3 day weekend.

Not much has changed as far as my outlook or goals. Just Day 4 today, that's it. Once again, I was coming off a 45-60mg daily oxy for about 4 months. 8AM snort 15, 2-3PM pop 15, evening snort 15-30. Last dose Thursday night and tried to take a thoughtful approach to a 3 days weekend of giving my body anything it needed to do the best job adjusting to this change. Not much new to say, but I do feel that I'm on the border of a different period in the wd, so I want to note my symptoms for anyone that's interested.

Sleep: Still not getting great sleep by any means, but I haven't been wandering around the house at 330am. First 3 nights clean I took xanax for sleep. I'm out now. Going to rely on muscle relaxers and pot for the next few days. I don't normally smoke.

Strength: I drank my last ensure this morning before work. I felt a little weaker today than the first three days, but it was also my first day back into the world and I survived fine. Getting an appetite back. 

Body temp: Today was my first day really having cold/hot swings. I was cold all weekend, but consistently so. Wasn't great in the office. Will layer better tomorrow.

Pupils: WTF!!!! They're still huge and my eyes are super sensitive. I've detoxed a lot and I have never, never, ever had this issue. I've had such bad physical wds and this time everything is mild and my eyes are fucked. I wear soft lens contacts. Any advice/experience?

That's about it for today. Like I said, same goals and same plan. This weekend will be a week clean and I'm thinking I'll be pretty well off by then. I'm just waiting for the weekend like every other person on the bus.",1434417107.0

Well the same vendor shipped some u-47700 for free as a sample.

**The Effects** (*Please take note data is mostly Nasal*):

* **Dosage** - I started at 1mg (My dosage of regular fent is 1mg so I started there) but that was not nearly enough so I bumped it up to 3mg , still not enough, so went to 5mg, still not enough so I went to 8mg and that was pretty good.  My average dose of B-F is ~4-5mg comparatively.

* **Euphoria** - 9/10 , easily some of the most euphoric opiates I've ever done and I've done them all (H, oxy, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, codeine, IV hospital fent/morphine/dilaudid, every other form of fent from patch to lollipops etc, dihydrocodiene, tramadol, kratom, etc etc etc)

* **Onset** - Strangely it has a slightly delayed effect when used nasally.  It also burns in the nasal canal.  So keep that in mind when using so you don't do a second dose before the first hits.

* **Duration** - Basically very similar to B-F in feeling(ie 9/10 on euphoria, B-F may be 7 or 8 out of 10) but the duration is even shorter and thus builds tolerance even faster (which was already a problem with B-F).  Duration appears to be around ~1 hour with u-47700 whereas B-F is ~3hours.

* **Comedown** - It definitely has a ""cocaine-like"" urge to redose thanks to the very short duration.  It even makes my lips/gums numb like C and has a slight dysphoria when closing in on the 1hour duration mark.  I call B-F and this stuff the ""cocaine of the opiate world"" for these reasons.

U-47700 is also more expensive so its great if you have the money and don't mind quickly building up tolerance and are ok with potentially suffering some horrific withdrawals (although I still say poppy pods are way worse by far).  Personally I'll probably stick with B-F and even that only for a while before going back to poppy pods b/c they last so much longer and are relatively cheaper.

I'm happy to answer any questions as well about either chemical(aside from sourcing of course).

I have a few questions!

I am in the Mile High Area and have recently gotten back into BTH. I have been using everyday between .5 and 1.0 grams for a little longer than a month. I want to do a short taper with suboxone which I have done before. My only concern is I have a friend who was originally prescribed suboxone that goes into precipitated withdrawels every time he tries to induce. He has been abstaning  around 24 and at the max 36 hours after last use before taking 2mgs of suboxone. He hasn't had any issues before ~2 years ago when abstaining for as little as 17 hours. I'm wondering if anyone knows what a good period to wait before induction for fentanyl? I guess the word going around at a clinic is that leo has tested BTH in my area and has discovered fentanyl in the gear. So here's what I'm asking (ANY HELP AND I WOULD LOVE YOU FOREVER)

-Whats best time for induction with fent

-If after 36 hours I go in precipitated hoping I can have the will power to not go cop should I just shower for 12 more hours??? lol

-Is it smart to use lope to help with W/ds before switching to Subs

-Has anyone heard of fent in BTH?

Any help would be appreciated

PS he looks pretty bad when he tries to induce according to the cows scale. Should I just wait till I feel I'm at a 26+ and go for it?",1434524686.0

so i've always enjoyed opiate highs that are more about duration than intensity. i mostly just wanna be buzzed enough to know that i'm high, but not have it be a 4 hour roxy high or something. 

i used tramadol for a few weeks but eventually i was up to like 300-350mg's and while i still got a sick buzz that lasted all day, i started getting the negative side effects/twitchiness so i decided to cut it short.

what i've been considering is some OP's, as apparently they last really fucking long and sell for less than anything ""abusable"". I was wondering how the time release works specifically. ie: if it's an OP40, will I get 13 mg's at first, 13 mg's in 4 more hours, then 13 mg's 4 hours after that? or is it something else?

i basically just want something that isn't too expensive that will keep me buzzed. i use opiates to treat depression and anxiety so i can actually enjoy important days and get out of the house, so that's more what i'm aiming for.

i was also thinking kratom but idk if that will be a good idea in the long term (although I guess any opiate habit isn't, but i mean that more in the sense that kratom might stop working as well down the road)

any input on OP's and kratom, or any other suggestions in general?

I've snorted 60mg worth of them and I felt a mild buzz as well as a mental kick, I was talkative, relaxed feeling in my limbs and so on. It just felt a bit weaker than my previous experiences if memory serves. The pills were as bitter as always too. Usually, 60mg have me nodding pretty good, but first of all, nasal has a worse BA than oral and second of all, I've smoked about 2.5g of dope since mid May with only about a week total of sobriety between so my tolerance is definitely higher than it used to be.

I'm thinking of staying clean until Friday-ish and then popping 60mg of them to see if they're the real deal. Do you guys figure that should work? Or should I wait longer, considering my recent dope usage?

Also, my ROA for these is as follows: crush them up, put them in one thin layer of TP and then just swallow them, it's referred to as parachuting in some old bluelight threads. Do I need to wash off the coating or not?

So today, I started the morning routine; picked up a half and did about half of it. I've had a cold or bronchitis or lung cancer or something for the past week or so, so I've been regularly drinking robitussin to ameliorate the issue of my lungs trying to escape my body through my mouth.
Today, I drank a bit more, figuring I'd built a tolerance. Holy shitballs I was wrong about the tolerance. Heroin and a moderate dose of dxm (~250mg or so) complement each other amazingly well. About an hour in it felt like a light acid trip ever so slightly drowned in a euphoric bliss. I'd tell the stories of walking through the park and sketching little vignettes of nature, but I feel like I'm rambling enough as it is.

Have any of you tried this? I highly recommend it if you're safe about it (avoid like the plague anything with guaifenesin in it) and you keep your fucking hands as far away from a steering wheel as possible.

At first his blond head looked like a dirty, ear-wax stained q-tip.  But then gravity set in.  His blond hair slowly morphed into a hairdo.

""Jesus!  You look like fucking Beck"", said Kym.  

And The Curse was born.

""Dude you look like that loser guy.""

""Did anyone ever tell you that you look like Beck?""

""Hey!  Beck!""

At first he liked it.  Then he shrugged it off.  But slowly with Kym's help The Curse grew from kinda funny to a full blown Annoyance.  I could see it in face at bars when girls he would normally try to chat up remarked upon the eerie connection after Kym ""casually"" dropped the reference.  He could kill it by shaving his head but Jason was stubborn.  He pretended nothing in the world could ever bother him...

It was around this time on a cold December night I swiped a 3 gallon tub of chocolate ice cream from the University cafeteria.  I took it from the freezer and walked it to the Muni stop.  Holding 3 gallons of ice cream without gloves leads to numbness.  By the time the Muni bus rolled into the Mission District my lap, balls, arms and hands were numb.  But I horsed the damn thing home.  It barely fit in the freezer after Jason yanked out all the shelves.  Luckily for us, there was no actual food in there.  

""I love you.  Have I ever told you that?"", asked Jason.  I think he was talking to me but he was caressing the ice cream.  ""Chocolate ice cream is one of the three reasons why I walk the earth.""

""Yeah?""

""And you!  You big tall gangly freak!  You socially awkward, backwoods fucktard spawned by ignorant rednecks..."" Jason grabs me and kisses my cheek, ""You're lactose intolerant!  That's the BEST!  FUCKING!  PART!""

Two hours later Kym comes back from work.  She goes apeshit too.  It's the little things in life that make people happy.  And the drugs.  Apparently chocolate ice cream is great when your high.  Being allergic to dairy I wouldn't know.  A half cup of that stuff would render my bowels to liquid.  

Three gallons of ice cream is a lot.  Vince came over so we could calculate scales for our astronomy map project.  He brought ice cream cones and was enjoying one he smeared peanut butter on.  Kym was licking a double scoop she kept topping off with whip cream.  But she kept sucking the nitrous oxide and soon only liquid came out.  Jason created a thing he dubbed Angry Ice Mecha Man.  A skull sized lump of ice cream in a bowl, two cones for horns and Gobstoppers for eyes, nose and mouth.  I munched a bag of nacho flavored corn nuts.  

""Mmmm.  So much yummy ice cream"", says Kym tonguing her cone.  

It's a bright day and Vince's light sensitive glasses are black which is good because he's stunned and openly staring at Kym who obviously isn't wearing a bra. Her skin tight camouflaged half shirt is cut diagonally showing a lot of skin.  Tight, low slung jeans display the gold belly chain that sways hypnotically and lures the eye to Kym's smooth skin between her belly and hips.

""Yes!  A lot!"", agrees Vince shaking his head to break off the Kym trance.  ""A gallon of water is more than 8 pounds.  8.33 lbs to be nearly precise.  But the uh conversion and decimals...yeah.  But ice cream has air so I'd say more like 5 lbs?""

""What?"" interrupts Jason as he spits out Angry Ice Mecha Man's candy eye into a napkin to eat later.  ""Three pounds lost to air?""

""Oh yes!  The influx of air in the processing displaces mass!"", quips Vince who is one of the most violent, crazy motherfuckers I have ever met.  But now we see a shy Asian kid with weird glasses using stolen ice cream to teach math.  

""What about scoops?"", quizzes Kym.

""Well how big is a scoop?"", ponders Vince rubbing his temple.  ""3 ounces?  4?  Lets say 4 for easy math.  So a gallon is 128 ounces right?  So your 3 gallons is like 384 ounces...divide by 4.  Uhm, 96 scoops!  But I highly doubt you'd get more than 86 due to waste, melting, etc.""

""Damn you're Rain Man"", mumbles Jason through a mouthful of dairy.

""Who's that?"", asks Vince who's from Hong Kong.

""No that's math Jason.  Fucking art school dropout!""

""Fuck you Devil's Daughter!  At least I was accepted to college!  Go make me some coffee"", says Jason crunching an ice cream cone and staring at her.

""Aww did I hurt your feelings Beck?"", says Kym stalking over to Jason.  ""We're so proud you dropped out of an expensive, useless, shit for brains art academy.  It scores a hair higher than the Creation college right?  Hey quick loser!  Hit me with the mean value theorem!""

""Oh I can"", says Vince raising his hand.

""FUUUUUCK you Kym"", growls Jason going back to his ice cream.

Times like this trip me out because calculus is not an everyday thing.  Kym reads Cosmopolitan, Architectural Digest and People magazine.  I am borrowing $30K to learn theorems like this and am floundering because I went to public schools.  Without Vince and the tutor club I would be dead in the water.  And Kym who as far as I know never went to college just tosses it out there to mock her roommate?  
This world...this world is not what it seems.

""You guys can throw it away"", I say after a week.  Frankly I'm sick of chocolate dairy kisses and seeing Jason and Kym nodded out wearing chocolate mustaches.

""NO!"" they both yell.

""It's mine!"", screams Kym.

""He gave it to me!"", yells Jason.  

They eye each other warily.

""Listen Beck!  You've got to stop leaving it out.  Pretty fucking simple to put it back in the freezer after you get a bowl.""

""I would Ms. Satan but I spend all my time looking for bowls because YOU hide them in your room!""

""I hide them in my room because YOU never wash dishes!  If I want a fucking bowl of Captain Crunch in the morning I shouldn't have to do YOUR dishes!""

""Easy!"", I say holding the vaporized black tar in my lungs before I exhale.  This brings me an easy, dreamy peace...But these two?  They get so angry they can RAGE their way past a nod just to shit on each other.  ""It's just ice cream man.  Lets dump it and I'll steal another flavor ok?""

""NO!"", they both yell.

""It's the principle of the thing"", explains Jason.  ""You must finish what you start.""

""Yeah"", agrees Kym. ""Plus I would never throw away anything YOU gave me.""

""He gave it to ME!"", exclaims Jason.

""Jesus I gave it to both of you.  Relax man...""

Then something new happens.  Jason and I don't do dishes.  We might rinse off a plate or a utensil we need but never the whole sink.  

REVELATION: Apparently Kym did the dishes.  

Kym is now on strike.  Dishes pile high.  A colony of tiny winged insects has staked the filthy sink as their domain.  A new generation rises from the dairy stink every other day.

""Yo Beck!  Do the FUCKING dishes!  It's your turn!""

""Why is it my turn?"" yells Jason.  ""You eat cereal!  You eat ice cream!""

I think of doing the dishes just to shut them the fuck up but...Nah.  I wash dishes professionally and eat out.  But I am tired of finding Jason in our room looking for bowls or spoons.

Things got uglywhen Kym found her clean spoons stashed under Jason's mattress.  Tempers were wearing thin.  I bravely avoided them both and took most of my meals at school.  But I had to try something to bring back harmony for I was the one who brought them the chocolate ice cream of discord.  

""Look Pop Tarts!  Apple cinnamon ones!"", I say coming through the front door with Melo.  And we both stop.

""My god!"" I exclaim.

""Wow..."", says Melo who was coming over for a bowl of ice cream.  

Kym wears a towel in her dress shielding her as she hunches over the sink wolfing down chocolate ice cream without a bowl or spoon.  She feasts from her cupped hands like a ghoul slurping up liver.  Jason crouches on the floor sucking hunks of ice cream down his throat from an old Chinese food takeout carton I think he found in the trash.  We had dim sum two nights ago.  Chocolate rivulets bleed down his face staining his Exploited t-shirt.  They both look up without shame and then go back to feeding.

""Want some?"", asks Kym who's using her combat knife to hack out blocks of ice cream.

""Uhm nope.  No thanks Kym"", says Melo looking at me.  Melo scavenges food from dumpsters.  Even he is disgusted by my friends.

""We'd have bowls but Beck over there is on dish strike"", says Kym.

""Spoon thief!"", belches Jason.

""Let us smoke this peace offering"", says Melo pulling out a short, stout blunt from his jacket pocket.

Park weed has been good lately.  The Dead are not touring and like a blackhole that sucks hippies- the weed, psychedelics and unwashed masses have invaded Golden Gate Park.  Kym removes her ice cream bib and sits next to me as we smoke.  

""Ugh!  It tastes like chocolate milk after you two smoke!"", I complain.

Melo takes some mushrooms and chops them up.  He makes a milkshake that everyone but me enjoys.  I just eat a couple of caps.  And then the trouble begins.  
Jason drops the joint as Kym hands it to him.

""Fuck!"", he yells.

""Good one Beck!"", mocks Kym.

""You know..."", says Jason closing his eyes, ""THAT is getting old.""

A little crack in the armor.  Does she lay off?  Does she relent?

""What?  The Beck thing?  Oh.  Ok"", says Kym patting his shoulder.  Then she whispers in his ear ""Soy un perdedor...""

Jason rubs his face and smiles into his hands.  ""Clever girl"", he says.  Then he picks up the Chinese food container, sticks his finger in it and flicks it at Kym.

Melo and I are sucked into Kym's orb of silence and outrage.  She is wearing a tailored white cotton dress a Mexican lady two blocks away sewed for $45.  This loose, comfortable hand embroidered white sundress was Kym's favorite informal choice for a daytime lounge.  The splitter splatter of chocolate ice cream spray stains the pearly white cloth...

We all sense a line was just crossed.

Kym's looks at her dress.  Then her head slowly rises.  She locks the fury that burns from her blue eyes onto Jason who stares back grinning.  Uncaring and quite unconcerned.  We watch the chocolate blobs slowly spread into the delicate white cotton.

Kym stands up and walks to the kitchen.  We all watch her slow, seemingly casual stroll as we brace ourselves.  Melo is about to yell as she suddenly whirls, snatches up a glass and flings it in one smooth motion.  Jason yelps as he ducks beneath the shattering pint glass.

""Fucking crazy devil bitch!"", Jason yells shaking glass from his hair.  

Melo grabs Kym as she yanks her knife from the ice cream carton.  She comes up kicking and screaming.

""Whoa!  Fucking take it easy Kym!  Jason!  What the hell?!"", Melo yells.  ""Over dishes?  Ice cream?  Are you all insane?!  Man fuck this!  I'm washing the dishes!""

""Yeah!"", I agree, ""This ice cream is killing you!  I'm throwing it away!""  I grab the container and toss it out to the curb for the rats.

We stew in our roommate shame as Melo washes our dishes.  Both Jason and Kym offers to help but he refuses.  ""Sit down and be nice!"" he commands.

So we sit glumly in the living room smoking cigarettes.  When he is done Jason sponsors a heavy, heavy dragon session.  Everyone nods in and out of reality.  Transgressions are forgotten as we are all slowly pulled from this world into into the poppy field.  The sky is clear blue and these fields are endless.  The visions and colors are insanely bright...As we slowly return to the apartment Kym cuts lines of MDMA and makes coffee.  

As Jason clears his nose and blinks.  ""Fuck thats disgusting.  I'm just gonna eat the powder next time.""

""Yeah it's a shorter high too.  I just like the rush"", says Kym.  ""Jase...I'm sorry I threw that glass at you.""

She walks over to him and hugs him.  He looks over at me and pretends to grab her ass but we can all see he is touched.  

""Nah.  I'm a bastard and totally fucked with you.  If the dry cleaner can't get the stains out I'll get you a new dress.""

""Gracias Beck"", Kym smiles.

""Yeah.  About that..."", says Jason running his hands through his golden locks.  ""Can you shave me?  I'm over the hair.""

""Ok.  What do you want?  Scalped?  Mohawk?""

""Mohawk.  I'll scalp it later.""

""I have some blue dye left.  And some black.  Oh!  Blue on the bottom and black tipped?  That'd be cool!""

And there is peace.  

These wars come every few months.  At first I would try to interfere but now I let them have their fun.  Buttons are pushed, words are screamed and glass is shattered.  Life moves on and only a slight dent in the kitchen wall reminds us all of the price of love.  ",1434476376.0

(All names are on a first name basis so im not worried about any of these guys being compromised this is for you N if you read this :))
**T: yeah when I got here cystal told me that your dad just called
and I was like ""OH SHIT""**
*N:Damn bro
Thank you again for the save
He started blowing my phone up right as you messaged me that
(but I saw your message after the fact, just saying like in the same time period)
so what happened is, I met my friend at school, I shot him up with the last morphine I had because he was sick
And then we tried hitting up some people (s, c, t, and our mobile dope girl A in tempe)
We picked up chuck from jomax and went to meet his boy at DV park
He got a half of some pretty good gunpowder
He busted out, and then he decided he wants another half because the stuff was good (like pretty nice gunpowder, 7/10)*
So chuck calls him up again and he comes back to drop off the second half
After that we went to drop chuck back off and my bud smoked us out fat
After that I asked if he wanted to still try sean's pure, and he was down to get a dub
That's where i went wrong
I shouldn't have offered, I should had just waited until tomorrow or somehing
So we haul ass over to his place, go up
Sean wanted to try the stuff we got, and he actually really  thought it was good (like one step below the pure he gets)
*So my bud smoked him out fat (lol he's so generous) and we basically cash one of the bags (one of the two halves)
afterwards, S was trying to scheme some ways to get some cash. he was pissed because his dad was trying to buy dope off nick and that was the money he was gonna throw down with us
So he's a little pissed at Nick (who was at work). We smoked some dope and G (my buddy didnt want to smoke any but he snorted  a tiny tiny bump and it got him wired af)
(sorry for making this so long I'll cut it short with this next message lol, still a little spun. But def worth reading all if you wanna understand what happened today)*
So sean decides to try and pawn his desktop and monitor. PS3 too but his controller wasn't working. So we fucking get over there, and they said they're won't accept the comp ""because it's too old""
Fucking dumbshits so we drive back to sean's (this is when my dad started calling me)
I started freaking out, and my boy was starting to get a little sketched too because he had to get home as ell
(he's 19 and lives with his parents too, cool guy actually, he's really awesome. I'll introduce you to him sometime)
SO YEAH
*Sean called his boy 3 times to see if me and my bud could get that dub, no answer. So we told him we had to leave, and he was cool about it. I'm bummed I couldn't throw business his way this time but atleast my friend smoked him out faaat.
We raced back to school, I jumped in the car, abandoned all paraphernalia, drove home to a furious dad who had to cancel his hair appointment because i was late.
Luckily he actually sat down and listened to my story (put short ""Dad, I'm sorry for going behind your back. I was invited to hang out with my friends and I knew you'd say no. So my plan was to go hang and then go back to school to work on classes and be home before 4, but we had car troubles which made me late"")*
And he believed me , I think. But he took my phone and keys. So idk what's going on man. Sorry for being all tweaky but I hope you have the time to read everything above, it's an explanation of today and how I fucked up

I had a verbal fight with him and havent spoken to him in a few months. Last week my contract finished so i am out of work.

I found a cheap motel and have been here since then. 
I got my scripts filled today but just feeling really down on my luck, i stink, i have no clothes. I cant afford motels much longer so im looking at homeless shelters.

Anyways, the plan was to get my car and hit up my bank pull some cash and meet my guy all before 4, when my bank closes. Only problem is the only 2 physical locations where I can pull from this particular bank are either 35+ min away OR 45+ min away. And that's without traffic! So, by the time I got my damn car back I have about 30 min to get the cash. Well I didn't make it and the fucking place closed.

Since I had already text my dude and lined something up, I texted him and explained my situation.  He said no problem, where you at? So I meet him.  Give him my sob story.  Apologize. Say ""I got you man, FO SHO tomorrow"" you know the shpeal. I feel bad because this guy has prob heard this story 100000x before but he has mercy and says ""no worries, I got you""

CUT TO THE NEXT DAY - I miss the dead line for the bank again BUT my paycheck is suppose to go through Tuesday (or Weds morning at like 2am) so I wait...........................by the time night time comes around I notice he texted me some time in the afternoon. Fuck. He's probably pissed. He's probably gonna cut me off. Oh geez. 

No............The text reads:   ""consider it a gift, babe""  SAY WHAT???? Holy bajeezus! Thank you! Thank you Thank you! A sigh of relief and a smile roll over me. Awesome!!  So what do I do? Meet up with him of course and get another half that night hahahahaha - When I picked up he said the same thing ""You got my text right?"" - - - ""Yeah you sure that's cool?"" - - - - ""Yeah course, I got you chick.""

I've used illegaly for a year or so (10-35mg per day, started at 10 the first 6 months), then last August I was getting an Oxy script here and there for back pain.  Like every 2 months.  Then the last 3 months I got a 30, 60 and then script of 90 for a herniated disc that was found after he ordered an MRI.

So I'm getting close to wanting to stop and my back pain is subsiding a bit.  So if I can stay strong and not ask for another script of 90 Oxy, which I'm sure I can get.  How do I let him know I can't just stop these?

Is the amount of time I've been on them (that my doctor actually knows about) enough to cause legit WD's like I am going to have?  Does it even matter?


I just don't want to go in there and make the situation worse by saying the wrong thing or acting the wrong way.  But if I can tackle WD's (despite the meds I already have) with the doctors help, I think I would prefer that.

I gave my wife my script to control since I couldn't, now she wants to come to the docs with me.  I said no because in the back of my addict mind I keep thinking of how I just want more pills.  But at the same fucking time I don't.

:(


Anywho, suggestions on how to ask a doctor for help quitting?

How do I get rid of them?,"**Holy Crap...I meant for this to be a quick post with just the question in the title and some background. I am extremely stressed and basically in full-scale panic mode though and it felt good to get this off my chest...I don't have anyone else to share it with. Feel free to skip to the much *much* shorter tl;dr at the bottom**


So, as the title states my cellphone ws either stolen/lost or misplaced. I normally delete any/all texts that come in even if they are slightly incriminating. Wednesday at work I was extremely busy so I didn't have a chance to delete anything that came in. I was the only person in the office so when I ran down to use the restroom I didn't lock up. When I got back from the restroom my wallet (with all of my money in it because I don't trust banks), my tablet, and my phone were all missing. I freaked out a bit but had work to do so I completed it and when the boss came in I told him what happened and that I wasn't going to be leaving the office until I turned the place upside down in search of everything in case I somehow just misplaced them. He didn't like the idea of me staying there but eventually agreed to it, even offering to help me look. 


The boss left after like 20 minutes and I kept looking. Finally after like 4 hours I gave up and called my fiancee and asked if she could bring me something to eat and a few bucks to put gas in my car since the light was on. We left to get food and while we were gone the boss called my fiancee's phone and asked why the fuck my car was still in the parking lot and to hurry my ass back there and get it. We rushed back and when we pulled up the boss came charging out of his car and started freaking out on me. I asked him what the hell was happening and he told me to shut my fucking mouth and put the office keys through the mail slot. I asked him if he was firing me and he asked me what the fuck did I think was happening. I went ahead and put the keys through the slot and I asked him again if he could please tell what happened and why he was firing me. He told me that it doesn't fucking matter that I just needed to get in my car and get the fuck out of there. I took a step towards him and he said one more step and I'm calling the police and having you arrested tonight. I told him he needed to relax and tell me what the hell was going on. He just looked at me and said, ""that's it, you're fucking done, I am having you arrested tonight!"" and he reached for his phone and called the cops. He told the dispatcher that he came to his office and found an ex-employee (Me) and his girlfriend attempting a B&E and we were threateing him. He said that he fears for his life and to please send someone right way and then gave them our names and read off our license plates to them as I made my way over to my car. I yelled to my fiancee, ""Babe, get back in your car and let's fraking get out of here. I hopped in my car and sped off. My fiancee apparently stayed behind for a couple of seconds to ask what was going on, hoping he'd speak to her. She'd tell me later that he told her to tell me, ""if he ever steps foot on this property again I'll make sure that he is one sorry motherfucker"" and then told her to get out of there because he'd have her arrested too. 


Since I didn't have any money or any gas in my car I couldn't go very far. I pulled over in a parking lot a few thousand feet and away and she pulled in a couple of minutes later, luckily she saw me since I didn't have a phone to tell her where I was. After asking me what in the world just happened and me confirming I had no idea what the hell it was all about, she relayed the message about being a sorry motherfucker if I ever decided to step foot on the property. (I am thankful he didn't end up telling her anything right then and there). It was late and we'd just dealt with a ton of bullshit so we decided the best course of action was to call it a night and just go home (unfortunately we live in separate places for the time being) and meet the next day and try to figure out what to do. (Apparently she sent him a text asking him to please tell her what happened and basically asked for some clarification, luckily he didn't respond to her.) When I got home I went to use my key to get in the house and my key no longer worked, my own family changed the locks on me without any warning. They let me come in and pack a few things but made me aware I was not welcome there...they pulled the same stunt and didn't give me a solid reason as to why though.


Here's my drug riddled over stimulated brain theory: When I went to the bathroom the boss went in and stole my stuff. He probably had some suspicion that I was doing something I shouldn't have been doing (e.g. drugs), but I have no idea where that thought would've come from. I was never late, I always met deadlines, and I would work tons of overtime if he ever asked. I think he took all of my important belongings (wallet, tablet, phone) because it would be too obvious if he just took my phone. I think he went through the messages and found what he was looking for. I am assuming that there must have been a couple of messages from a friend of mine that may have mentioned something about something. I was really good about deleting the messages as soon as they came in but if anything was sent to me between the time I had last deleted a message and my phone was taken (which is entirely a possibility and would be the only way this theory makes sense) there'd be know way of me knowing. The messages were different things about different substances but all of them were always written in dealer code; I guess it doesn't take a rocket surgeon to figure out what they mean though. He then proceeded to call my family and alert them of what he'd found, which is why they changed the locks on me. They also didn't seem all too surpised when I told them I had been fired. As I was being told to pack a bag and leave, I was asked if I had been using opiates again. They are aware that the doctor I go to for pain management prescribed me tramadol but she wasn't aware that the doctor recently changed the perscription from tramadol to some super strong 5/325 Norocs^/s/ but that doesn't matter to them because drugs are drugs are drugs. The only way they could've found out about the opiate use was through whoever may have seen messages on my phone. 


I think the only person he didn't alert to what he found was my fiancee and hopefully that's because he believes she uses too and it wouldn't make a diference, thing is though, she doesn't, she doesn't even like taking tylenol. If he ever finds out that she isn't using anything and is completely clean and sober he'll end up telling her too which will complete the ""ruin incriminatingmobile's life"" project that he started. Which brings me to the actual point of the post: before he gets the chance to tell her I'd like to know if there is a way to completely wipe the phone? I know that you can wipe it remotely with an app or something but this isn't a smart phone. It's an LG phone but it is one of those first touch screen type phones I got as a temporary back up burner style phone. I mean, he probably already sent the text messages to himself but they never mention me by name so I don't think there'd be a way to prove they were mine unless he had the phone itself. I can't prove that he was even the one who took it, but, assuming that I can, is there any legal recourse for someone doing something like? Isn't this theft and defamation of character? I mean, the guy left me homeless, jobless, pennyless, and potentially causing my fiancee to leave me. That's pretty much destroying a person with words.

tl;dr - someone stole my wallet, tablet, and phone. I can only assume that it was my boss. The phone *may* have had some slightly incriminating messages on it. He fired me the same day it happened and wouldn't give me a reason. I can also only assume that he shared this information with my relatives (their email address and phone numbers were saved under there names, and he knows them because they go to the same church and he knows I was staying with them). Is there a way to wipe a non-smart phone? Also, if I can prove it was him, is there any legal recourse for someone doing something like this?",1434728975.0

i then get super bad lower back pain, and upper back pain in 2 spots(where my shoulder blades are kinda but closer to my spine). most of my body feels sore and tired/worn out.

The situation:

Been in PM for a year, never had an issue with my urinalysis results. Then, at my last appt, end of May, PA has written my scripts, they are in my hand and she says ""oh no!"" You had a cocaine metabolite in last months test.... Took my scripts away from me. Now I'm not gonna lie to my fellow bropiates, I do coke occasionally but never ever within a week of a PM Appt, so I was truly shocked.... She gave me clonidine patches and said they would randomly drug test me throughout the month of June. I asked her to re-test my urine sample because I truly thought it was a mistake. She called the next day and said they ran my urine thru the test again and it was definitely there, and not only that but they tested the previous months urine again and found cocaine in it also. Both samples (April and May) had cocaine metabolites below the threshold of positive but they were present, just barely. I asked her about false positives because I use a lot of allergy nasal sprays and she said because they use a mass-spectrometer to do the test there's no way it was a false positive, cocaine metabolites are very unique. Now I've stuck to my guns, complete denial of ever even doing cocaine. I've take two of three random tests since this happened which I am 99% certain are clean, maybe some oxy because I had some left over that I've been using sparingly this month. I go back for my final test a week from tomorrow which I will likely be completely clean of everything except what I am prescribed from other doctors (Xanax, GABA, etc.) but I know they are going to ask me how it got into my system. All I've been able to come up with (assuming there was no mistake with the test) is a e-cig I got from my roommate in college that I occasionally use wen I'm trying to quit cigarettes, and never had the need to change the liquid that was in it when it when it was given to me.... Which could work considering the levels were so low... My father works in the tobacco industry and does work with the FDA which is trying to ban all e-cigs that can be manipulated by the user for this very reason, drug use. 

What do you guys think of my story and does anyone have any other ideas or suggestions as to how I could explain low levels of cocaine in my system two months in a row?

Now im wondering if I bought a brick or so and did <5 bags a day for 10 days or so, or even less a day and stretch it out a little longer,  then either stop all opiate intake altogether or take like .5 or .25mg of sub for a couple days to help come off the dope. Basically switch out my bupe addiction for a short term heroin addiction, to make the bupe withdrawal bearable, then come off the dope much gentler since I dont have a long term habit.

Forgive me if this is naive Im just wondering if anyone has any experience with doing anything similar.

This has worked perfectly fine every time, yet I've seen and heard of people putting a small piece of cotton and sucking it up through the cotton. Is there any advantage to this aside from removing impurities? I'm basically wondering is the strength increased by sucking it through cotton rather than just sucking up the solution straight up with the needle?

To my knowledge, cotton is only necessary for when you have tar #3, which I am fortunate enough not to have, I've got nice powder #4",1434671376.0

Wow, I'm so honored, hehe. Basically I did lacerate my spleen which is the most minor of injuries, and I badly broke my tibia, fibula, and femur in multiple places.

I would've checked here sooner, but I just got access to my computer today. Anyway I'm fairly sure I haven't been given morphine at all. Currently I'm on 15mg oxycodone every 3 hours and a dilaudid IV drip PCA (0.4mg/ml) which I control myself and is on the highest dose allowed (pretty delicious, lol).

I do have a massive cast on now which is going to have to stay on for quite a while, but it is nowhere near as bad as the first cast I had on, which had footlong metal rods sticking up out of it (don't ask me lol). Now that I've had my second surgery, I also apparently have large rods and pins (I'm talking quite large; I even got some ketamine for the operation to place them in there) inside my leg, which will have to stay there presumably forever. I'm surprised to see all these comments, lol. Anyway, thanks to /u/everything_is_still for letting this community know despite the rarity with which I post.

Edit: I had my first physical therapy session and am making a pretty quick recovery, which is good. A couple more days and I should be out of the hospital. I also got these really weird stitches in my lip which have been getting scratched cause of the opiates, but were just going to dissolve anyway as far as I can tell. lol.

Never seen anything like it before, I've done ecp that was more of a tannish color, being on the west coast, bth is obviously the most common. When I mixed it up it went from a white/grey to a dark color, almost reddish. When I shot it, I was instantly knocked out for a while, like nothing i've felt before. Woke up in a daze and felt heroin-type effects for the rest of the day, some nausea in waves and other such things. I thought I did way too much, next day did half and it knocked me out the same way, but the other effects were less, not really lasting much time. 

This is when I started thinking that something wasn't quite right. I have heard of ""gunpowder"", and read somethings about heroin/fent mix. I've never done fent before but it seems like this might match the effects, maybe? The description of how it looks seems to match what people have said in the past about this. It makes sense to me if it was mixed with bth cuz I've had some that cooked to a similar reddish color in the past. What do you guys think?",1434660739.0

Abstinence, tolerance breaks and control are important but what I was lacking was a cushion to fall back on.  I don't do sober.  And this great country has legally provided me the solution since I was 21 years of age...Alcohol.  

So after I smoked all the heroin my boss gave me from her meth deal gone bad, I simply switched to alcohol.  So simple.  I will now drink to stave off my cravings and the lowly behavior from my junkie side.  But I'm not going to be a cruel either.  I have half a bag of ECP and two grams of tar AT HOME.  Not at work.  I will force myself to behave for three days.  Discipline.  This is day one.  It begins at a Mexican restaurant.

""Salud!"", says Sal holding up a shot glass.

""SALUD!"", we shout in unison and gulp Sal's homemade tequila which he stores in mason jars.  Most of his other tequilas have been poured in margaritas for this impromptu lunch gathering of 40 or 50 of my drunk coworkers.  

There are limes and salt but I just swallow the tequila down neat, Mexican style. The first two shots made me ill.  Withdrawal is a bitch.  But the third one is winning.  I feel pleasantly buzzed and give my tequila some Dos Equis to keep the party flowing.  The key is a lot of booze...I hope.  

Mexico is playing Germany in the World Cup and seeing how our favorite restaurant Los Portales is a Mexican bar and grill we are all screaming Viva Mexico!  Some of us care about soccer but all of us enjoy slamming Dos Equis, margaritas and shots of tequila.

Our CEO was buying which meant we were clearing out Sal's liquor stock.  The last week had been brutal and I got my first taste of the fast paced , incredibly demanding work ethic placed on my engineering group.  Rosie and Bryan sold a subscription service that did not exist.  We made it exist with 12 hour work days, gallons of coffee and the unity of the hive mind.  We worked together, slept in our cubes and ate Adderall.  There were more than a few wild eyed sniffy-sniffers wandering about...I was one of them thanks to my boss.  Rosie scored coke in a dyke bar she discovered in San Jose.  And a whole industry was born in a week with everyone from Marketing guys making banners to engineers making shit up.   
And now we feast.  

This work week is spent not working.  People cruise in and out as they please.  Guys like my fellow engineer Ben seem to live here but most goof off.  However they will all come running back if the CEO calls.  Why?  Money.  

The printers are wired to show stock price.  Walking through the halls you could glance over and see your net worth.  Everyone watches their shares rise.  Fevered dreams of wealth burn in our greedy, diseased minds.  Tales of overnight millionaires poison any sober or reasonable expectations in this town.  VC money floats around like dreams of ham at the fat kid camp.  Greed is the deity in charge.  Gluttony is close behind though.

Me?  I was too late to get much stock.  But I was more impressed with the debauchery.  These are the Roman times.  Gluttony was a better vice than Greed to me.  I drank deeply from this cup.  

After a couple months I had reintroduced myself to all the drugs I quit because...I don't know.  I can blame it on pressure.  We perform miracles regularly.  Or maybe stamina?  Without the coke I would have slept through most of the site launches.  But I think the main reason I removed my pharmaceutical restrictions was because I could.  Fuck it.  

I LIKE being high.  

But sometimes in the restroom when I am cutting out another line of coke for my career...I can hear ancient whispering voices.  They creep from the well deep inside my soul where no light ever shines.  I can hear them when I ache for release.  When I yearn for the touch of the gods...

They whisper, ""The Darkness comes.""  

I meet up with Sera for a late night dinner at Frankie, Johnny and Luigi's restaurant.  I think she can tell I'm high.  It's 10pm and I'm wearing sunglasses while toying with my sausage rigatoni.  

""You ok?  Your not eating.  Are you using again?"", she asks quietly while observing my ability to drink an entire carafe of wine by myself in ten minutes.

""A little"", I admit as I signal for more wine.  I think about asking if she still has any of that oxy or morphine for her spine...but it seems in poor taste.  Maybe later.  ""Work is tough so I enjoy unwinding.  Just a bit.""

""I saw your boss on CNN.  Looks like you guys are doing great.""

""Yeah sure.  Hey do you still get those pills?""  

Sera looks at me sadly.

Damn!  Not an expression I like to see.

""I do"", she nods sipping her diet Coke.  

""Sorry...I just...Man!  Pressure.  Always building some new thing that doesn't actually exist.  You know fuck it.  How are you Sera?  How's Ronald?""

""Donald.""

""Oh yeah"", I take off my sunglasses and rub my face.  ""Sorry.  Donald.""

""We're taking a break.  He's a little too conservative for my taste.""

Donald is a short, handsome butt chin man that barely hits 5'5 feet.  Next to Amazonian built Sera who stands 5'10 and enjoys wearing platform heels he must have some issues.  I giggle at ""a little too conservative"".  Man, I'm sloppy drunk.  And rude.  It's way too soon to ask about pills!  Fuck.  See?  Opiates show me how to be human.  What to say and do.  Coke and alcohol make me pushy and weird.  But I have always been a lovey, dovey, touchy feely drunk.  So I reach out and grab Sera's hand and look into her luminous, purple eyes.  

""Sera...He's a good guy!"" I try to express earnestly but it feels off.  Forced.  ""You two seem happy-"" and then a tinny, annoyingly loud 8bit version of Camptown Girls explodes from my North Face vest pocket.  I take out my clamshell phone and see it's Rosie.  Shit.

""Hi Rosie"", I answer.  

""Hey you fucka motha Wrrggshhhphhht!"" and my phone goes dead.  I smile at Sera.

""Nice phone.  That's a fancy one!  Hey wasn't it YOU that said technology was driving a wedge in humanity?"" smirks Sera.

""Maybe.  Sounds like something I'd say.  Or was that the Unabomber?""

She laughs loud in her goofy way that ends with a snort.  I love this girl.  Her purple eyes follow my face.  I feel ashamed for some reason so I put the sunglasses back on.   

""It is GOOD to see you Sera.  Yes I'm high.  Yes I have a cellphone.  Do you hate me?""

She looks at me and rolls her eyes.  ""Oh puh-lease!  You KNOW I always give you a pass.  I don't know why...""

""Maybe it's this cool new phone"", I smile sliding the thing across the table.  Sera doesn't have a cellphone so she looks at it. 

""It's shaking"", says Sera holding it up, ""Says 'coke' comma 'mj'.  What does that mean?""

Coca Cola and Michael Jordan?  Probably not.  I smile and call Rosie.  She is a phone screamer so I hold the phone away from my ear as she shrieks at me.

""I have coke.  You get marijuana!  Is your lover there?  Ask her!"", screams my phone quite audibly across the table in a South American accent.  

""Hey Sera sorry...It's my boss.  She's from Costa Rica"", I say like that explains Rosie.  ""Do you know where to get any weed?""

And she does.  Sera has a hookup in the city.  It's a Tuesday night and Rosie pulls up as we finish coffee and dessert.  Rosie wears faded blue jeans with a matching jean jacket and her hair is combed in a butch Elvis hairdo.  

""This is Sera.  Sera this is Rosie"", I introduce.  Rosie hugs Sera and kisses her cheek.  As she does this she shoots me a lecherous look like a guy approving of another guy's date.  

Before we leave I grant myself Sobriety Sanctuary!  This is day two but it is 11:30pm.  Close enough.  Oh look, I have a bullet with some heroin in it.  SNORT.  SNORT.  SNORT.  FuuuUUUUUCCK.

I sit in the passenger seat as Rosie speeds towards the city.  Sera sits in the back sober.  Poor thing.  The SMACK GOD has touched my troubled brow.  Almost three days since we last met oh my god.  Slack jawed I stare out the window.  I think Rosie says vaguely inappropriate things to Sera but the Serenity is upon me. 

Lights warp and form laser cocoons around us as we drive through a tunnel or maybe a bridge?  Who knows?  Wait!  Oh shit.  Am I on acid too?  I fucking can't remember.  But I have some at home...I am so used to being high I thought the rainbow sheen on Sera's face at dinner was normal.  But now the rainbows MAGNIFY.  Waves of translucent rainbows spin and form bubbles around us.  

Maybe it's just a flashback.   

And then there's Rosie coked out babbling nonstop about god knows what, driving with one hand and changing lanes every time she turns her head to bark at Sera.  A mirror with chopped up lines of coke sits on the island between us.

""Hold the wheel!"", she commands as she grabs the mirror and hunches over with a straw.  She does a line as I steer...Whoa like a video game.  I am good at video games.  I follow the path...I can't believe I'm driving!  Wait?  Is this real?  Rosie snorts another line and then she SCREAMS and starts punching the ceiling.

""YeeeaaaaAAAAAH!""

""Like a video game"", I remark to no one in particular.

""Uh are you guys ok to drive?"" asks Sera from the back.  I can hear her click her seat belt.

I look at the display.  The numbers keep going up.  75, 80, 85, 90...

""Take your foot off the gas"", I suggest mildly as I swerve us around a van.

Rosie grabs the wheel.  ""Watch it FUCKA!"", she yells.

I'm wasted and stare forward.  Little photograph mirror cubes tumble towards me.  This is the road.  Wow.  Maybe I did take that acid?

And I nod out.  Gone...I have no idea who holds the wheel as Rosie does lines.  But we get to Sera's connection.  I wake up alone.  I mix coke and heroin bumps and snort with Rosie's straw.  Neighborhood looks nice.  I stare at house with a neat garden and smoke a cigarette as another nod approaches.  Monster wings pumping over the purple horizon of stars.  She is near.  I can feel her.

And I awake to the horn HONKING.

""Why-?!"", I yell sitting up.

""Relax"", says Rosie smoking a joint.  We appear to be driving down a freeway.  Then she opens her window, sticks her head out and screams at a car, ""FUCK YOU!  DICKLESS HORSE CUNT!""

I look back at Sera who shrugs.  English as a second language.  Then I notice Rosie is doing a line...She looks over at me from her lap and yells, ""Hold the wheel!""

Are we driving to buy weed?  Or did we buy weed and we are driving back?  I let the bliss roll over me with a sigh...and I nod out.

And there she is.  Kym.  Floating impossibly high off the ground staring down at me.  Her arms and legs are spread out like a free-falling skydiver.  She wears flowing strips of orange and midnight blue cloth.  Her wrists and ankles are covered with her collection of thin silver bracelets she bought back from Saudi Arabia.  Kym's bleached blond hair wavers and swirls around her face as if she is underwater or among the stars....Her eyes widen when she locks them with mine.  

Blue eyes flashing.  Cold, gemstone fury.  

""Why?  Why did you leave me?"", she demands.  

And I feel the gulf of separation.  Like a deep sea trench where the darkness is just too far, too deep and too alien to comprehend.

""I never wanted you to go away."" 

""LIAR!"" she SCREAMS.

""Please!  Come back!  I can't be like this!  I can't be without you..."" I beg.

She shimmers and radiates as starlight paints her skin.  I stare in awe but her eyes stab me.  Pure animal rage.  Her form stretches above and looms across the purple horizon.  She locks her fingers and thumbs into a triangle shape and points it at me.  Then she opens her mouth and a terrible sound fills my ears.  Grief and suffering reduced to laser intensity.  The sobs and anguish of one thousand broken hearts...and a terrible beam of light bursts from the triangle and burns my flesh away.  

And I SCREAM.

""Wake up!  Wake up!  WAKE UP!"", says someone shaking me awake, ""Oh my goodness!  You're having a crazy nightmare!  You were moaning and making sad little whimpering noises!  And yelling!  Jesus I hope no one calls the cops!"" 

""What..."" but my high is too heavy to comprehend.  I am still not back.  I close my eyes and try to get back...but it's gone.

We got Sera's car from Frankie, Johnny and Luigi's parking lot and end up back at my place.

Sera and Rosie talk as I lay stupid and blissed out in my bed staring at the ceiling.  I can hear Donald this, Donald that.  I blink and see the Universe.  Bliss...And I can hear tiny bells tinkling from the trade winds blowing across the desert sands.

And Sera is holding me.  I look at her.  She whispers, ""Your boss is creeping me out!  She keeps trying to hug me!  Can I sleep in here?  Please?""

""Sure...""

But where is here?  Behind my eyes I float across a bay of stars...Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka.  I trace Orion's celestial magnificence with my finger and glittering stardust falls from my hands...oh.  

My room.  Sera locks the door.   

And I think of you one last time before I pass out again.

I'm at a crossroads right now and I could use some words of wisdom from y'all.

 I'm new to dope since my usual DOC (Oxy) started getting more expensive and sparse around my neighborhood. I've used opiates for the last three months, but it was only since I was introduced to Heroin that I've used regularly. That was last month and I've smoked 2 grams in those four weeks since then.

I moved and my previous connect got arrested so I'm new in town and completely dry. I'm sober since Wednesday and thankfully haven't experienced the dreaded WD symptoms such as cold sweats, diarrhea and RLS as well as insomnia. I sleep fine and feel healthy. The mental part is much harder on me though. I feel so empty and bored with everything. Not even depressed, but there's this nagging desire to get high again, the rush to your head when you exhale after a big hit off the foil.

So I went downtown and decided to pick up. I talked to a homeless guy but he wasn't familiar with the dope scene unfortunately, still gave him some money and had a little chat. Then I went to the Methadone clinic and talked to a woman smoking outside. She was in the know and everything, but she told me she didn't want to hook me up because I'm young with the future ahead of me and she doesn't want to see me down that path. Kind words, but I was kinda pissed because I hoped to score at last. The methadone clinic was a bust because there is some assisted living nearby  and there was a huge congregation of people over there. Most of them probably addicts but I didn't want to risk anything with all the folk nearby, there could have been personnel over there and they might have chased me off the property.

The clinic is also open in the afternoon on some weekdays. I figure there'll be less commotion at those times so I probably have a better chance of swooping in under the radar and finally finding a hook-up. I reflected on my conversation with that woman outside of the MD clinic though and I honestly don't want to end up like the people I saw in front of the assisted living project (no offense). Should I just drop all this and get out while I still can? I feel like nothing brought me as much joy as those two grams, but in the long term it might bite me in the ass if I develop a habit now. I'm still in University and all but nothing gets me as happy as smoking H. I guess I want the best of both worlds but reality doesn't seem to allow for that.

b) I've heard that the subs will override the fentanyl's pain relief -- which is really not an option in my situation.

Been a junky for 3 years now. I'd been looking for ways to cover up my track marks without long sleeves in the summer...for a long time I would just dab on stick concealer but it never worked so well. I heard stage makeup/tattoo coverup works well but that's not exactly available at your local CVS.

To be honest I""m not a girly girl so I didn't know the first thing about makeup. Also, while I used to have moderate success dabbing concealer on old marks, if the marks were fresh the red would always show through anyway. So today I skyped my uber-girly best girlfriend and asked for a makeup tutorial on how to cover red marks (I said it was for acne) with drugstore makeup that will last through sweaty, hot summer days. I tried her tips and it worked perfectly!

So, here is the makeup tutorial:

YOU WILL NEED:

Liquid primer, use the color that is OPPOSITE from the color of your tracks on the color wheel (green for red, fresh marks, yellow for purple bruising, purple for green/yellow bruising)

Liquid Foundation, your skin tone

Loose Powder (optional)

Flat Makeup Brush (optional)

Powder Brush (optional)

1) First, apply some kind of liquid primer. Primer helps the next layer of makeup stay on a lot longer. Kind of like when you paint a wall, you put on primer first and then the paint. Some primer will be labeled ""primer"" and some will be labeled ""BB cream,"" which is primer that also moisturizes (good to speed up healing) and has some SPF. If your marks are fresh (still red) or you have purplish/red bruising, I REALLY recommend the green-colored primer. I use Loreal Anti-Redness Color Corrector ($12-$15). The ideal color primer you want to use is whatever color is opposite (on the color wheel) from the color of the marks you are trying to hide. In a pinch, you can always use flesh toned. Apply primer sparingly over the area you wish to cover. For most precise results, apply with a flat makeup brush (you can get a cheap one for just a few bucks). When I use my fingers, I dot it on and try to blend it in the best I can. Your skin will look REALLY weird with just the primer on, but don't worry-you'll fix that soon.

2) Apply liquid foundation liberally on top of the primer, and blend it in until it looks natural. I prefer to blend with my fingers on this step, but using a flat brush is recommended by makeup experts.  Don't rub it too hard when you blend-if you find you are removing too much by rubbing, try a gentle tapping motion to blend the edges. Let it dry. 

There are many kinds of liquid foundation, I prefer Loreal True Match Super Blendable #W6 ($10). I like the Loreal True Match line because it blends in with your natural skin color very well (as its name implies), and it stays on for a really long time. Also, all of their shades come in ""cool, warm, or neutral"" tones, which will help you find a better match. It can be difficult to pick the correct shade of foundation for yourself-I recommend opening the bottle at the store and dotting a sample on the back of your hand to double-check. Obviously the store won't like this but I do it anyway, and so do lots of people I know. It's extremely important to find the right shade, because otherwise you will end up highlighting your track marks instead of hiding them.

I generally stop here. Today I followed steps 1 and 2 and my extremely fucked up hand that had lots of red dots and all shades of bruising all over literally looked better than my other hand, which I never hit. It looked extremely natural, not like I put on a bunch of makeup. EVEN AFTER I WAS SOAKED IN RAIN OUTSIDE FOR HOURS, 80% still stayed on.

3) But if you REALLY need the makeup to stay on longer/need more coverage, finish off with a dusting of loose powder-the kind that comes in a jar, NOT a compact! DONT use a flat brush for this step-most kinds of loose powder come with their own powder brush, which has a conical looking head of bristles instead of a flat one. 

In case you're wondering, I personally think concealer sucks. Some people say it works for them, if you do use it try it on top of foundation.

Green primer + liquid foundation is a great combo for covering up undereye circles, too.

I've never tried this personally, but some people may get good results with just the primer + powder, depending on your skin type/if that's all you have.",1434852777.0

I got a bit of a habit for the Tramadol after slipping a disc 2 years ago, but the doc cut me off from them a few months back, which sucks.


I missed the antidepressant/euphoric feeling of Tram so much. Then by coincidence started dating a guy who was a recovering heroin addict. He relapsed a few times and we've broken up because he is bad for me. But I was so curious/jealous to try it, I didn't want to die and not know the feeling... the other night we hung out and he'd been relapsing so I asked if he would show me how to do it just once - after some light refusal, he went down the street and got some.


At first I thought should smoke it, but he said to get the full effect we should shoot. I was easily convinced because I wanted to do it the right way, like in Trainspotting etc...It was a strangely sexual experience and definitely the feeling of him helping me do that was quite erotic. The instant feeling was like Trammies x 10, just zonked out listening to Jeff Buckley, smoking, nodding off and shagging (though couldn't cum, damn) and VOMMING. Threw up for almost 24 hours afterwards, not sure if that's normal or not. I didn't expect to be so sick for so long... For awhile I was high so it didn't bother me, but was sick into the next day, so for me that's not worth it. However we shot twice so perhaps I should have only done it once. He said it was strong and good stuff.


All in all was a positive experience as now I know how great it feels in comparison to the other opiate I've tried - but TBH I'd rather an endless supply of my beloved Tramadols again over heroin. I'm more functional on Trams and to me it's a true antidepressant medication. I could see heroin being amazing if you had a slipped back disc but...


Just sharing my experience, because I do feel my heroin experience is a one time thing or at most something you'd do once or twice a year. I wouldn't want to do it every day, that much throwing up is very offputting.",1434821803.0

Years of drug abuse had allowed me to coast through existence without ever making an effort to figure out who I really ""am"", if you know what I mean, and getting Stone Cold Sober for 45 days forced me to take a look inward. I won't say that I ""found myself"", but I'll be damned if I didn't at least catch a glimpse here and there. 

Fast forward to a month post-treatment. I'm doing great, got my old job back plus a second job. I'm paying my bills, moving into a new place, and working on a half sleeve (tattoo) to commemorate my headfirst dive into sobriety. I met a stellar guy, was up front about my struggle with dope (among other substances) and he decided to take a chance on me anyways. 

Four months and 22 days into my Brand New Life and things couldn't be going better! Until my dealer (whose number I blocked in an effort to be a good girl) hits me up on facebook with his new digits. I can physically hear my world crashing down around me as I punch those numbers into my phone. As I'm driving to meet him, my head is full of clouds. I simultaneously feel like I'm driving off the edge of a cliff and climbing the stairs to heaven. Knowing that I'm mere minutes away from my first fix in months has me giddy. I'm not thinking about my significant other, I'm not thinking about my family, I'm not thinking about the weeks of self-reflection and therapy and coping mechanisms I endured not long ago. I'm thinking about Her warm embrace, I'm thinking about all of my problems melting away and life feeling effortlessly beautiful again. 

I pick up, and instead of just a ""one time thing"" as I intended, it turns into a three-week long that ends in a firey ball of flames entitled My Boyfriend Finding Empty Bags In My Room. Oh baby I'm sorry. I slipped it'll never happen again. It wasn't my fault. You weren't there when I needed you. It was a One Time Thing. Tears, some real and forged from regret of causing this person who means something to me pain, and some waterworks to get me out of this uncomfortable pickle. 

I revisit the sober life, and it does not suit me. That three week run was enough to elicit withdrawals, and the next week is hell. There is no pity to be found, nor sleep. I'm reminded why they call it ""kicking the habit"". 

The dreams have been bad enough to move me to pick up again today. I have an obsession with heroin. The first bag was free, but every subsequent bag costs a piece of your soul. Worth it.

Long time BTH user here. Copped from someone new(i hit up my old dealer, he gave me this guys numb) b/c my guys outta town. Whats crazy is his girlfriend came to give it to me via bus that took over 2 hours(we live in the same city but he has no car and mines outta commission for a week). So I know I didn't get scammed. We do the transaction, boom im home and I put about a .3 in(high tolerance).

I start heating it up and all looks normal, until its taking a little longer than normal. A bit of it has dissolved but not nearly as much as normal. Whatever, this stuff was a little ""harder"" than I normally get(was still a little sticky but it had a crunch to it). Keep at it and not shit is happening. Bring out the big guns(aka take it to my stove), barely any more dissolved. Fuck it i'm gonna try it anyway. I soak up about 50ml(about 3/4ths the water that was left) and shoot it. Very little feeling. Granted, about .2 of the .3 I put in the spoon is still there undissolved, I figure it's just some weak shit. Whatever. I go at it for another 20 minutes with a candle instead of a lighter/stove(save gas + i figured low and slow might dissolve it). nope. maybe 1/10th of whats in the spoon dissolved. At that point i said fuck it and threw a .15 on some foil and went to town. I'm slightly high but not really. Sucks.

Heres a pic of the undissolved-ness in a spoon. This is after going at it with a lighter for about 6 minutes and a stove on high for about 3. For comparison, if I throw a half in a spoon and fill'er'up with water, it's fully dissolved via lighter in under 2 minutes.

don't mind the crusty spoon. it's clean. just ""old"" per se.

My mom is bipolar and narcissistic and generally insane, flies off the handle a lot etc. But my father is a deadbeat, a horrible racist (proud of it too it's disgusting), both physically and emotionally abusive, and a crippling alcoholic.

Last night, a friend & I were discussing our favorite spots to inject heroin, as well as places we'd never hit. For example, I won't hit my hands (because I did it, once, hit a nerve & my hand swelled to twice its size), and I've never hit my neck, afraid I'd fuck it up & it'd go horribly wrong.

We both realized while we'd never done it, we weren't both utterly opposed to hitting under our tongues. I have some serious reservations about it--how do you sanitize your injection spot? And is it safe for a fresh injection site to be exposed to all the flora of bacteria in our saliva? Plus, sure, we both can see those big blue veins under our tongues, but are they for sure veins? If that got fucked up & swollen, wouldn't your airway be swollen shut in short order?

Great results so far.," I can't believe Kratom actually lived up to the hype for me.  In an effort to cut out or drastically cut down my Oxy habit (not sure which yet as I am taking them for pain and have a valid script.  Even though I was taking them recreational up until the last 4 months), I decided it's time to wean off for a while.  If nothing else it will lower my tolerance which I need anyway.  I don't take THAT much total, but I don't want to take them daily anymore. 

As someone who has taken anywhere from 10-40mg a day over the last 1.5+ years, I can definitely feel withdrawals when I wake up in the morning.  Anxiety is high, stomach is in knots, sweaty and wet shirt, tired.  I always just have that really negative icky feeling.  I can fight through it, but it just sucks. ESPECIALLY at the start of the week.  Fuck work mornings basically.

Anyway this morning I took about 4 grams of some Bali powder I got from getkratom.  I feel really good.  Almost opiate like, not quite, but definitely helping.  Actually it is kind of opiate like, if it wasn't so gross I'd take a touch more.

I have a ""security blanket"" with me in the form of a 7.5 Percocet but honestly haven't even thought about taking it.  Normally I'd be staring it down fighting the voice that screams JUST POP IT!

I'm in the process of ordering some empty capsules and more Kratom to use those instead of drinking it.  I mixed it with OJ this morning and it literally was the most vile shit I've ever forced down.  I didn't think I could do it actually but little by little I finished this shitty fucking mixture I made.  

Smoked a little weed as well but I am really encouraged by the results of Kratom so far.

When I was 18 I was dating a girl who shot dope so I decided to give it a try. I of course fell in love with opiates after that first shot. We dated for 6 months or so shooting a bag or 2 everyday until we broke up and I lost my connect. Fast forward 5 or 6 years and I have family and friends with Oxy scripts and have been using those for 3 years now and got my addiction back. 

  These days I usually just go out and buy myself blues to get me feeling good but it's just too damn expensive. I've been tempted for a while now to go find myself a dboy and start using some ECP since I'd get more bang for my buck. The only thing stopping me is that I know my blue dealer is legit and I get real blues and I'm not fucking around with shit that could be dangerous. 

 I just wanted everybody's opinion. Should I take the leap back to dope or stick it out with the safer blues that cost so fucking much? Any feed back or advice would be helpful so thanks in advanced. 



EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, they were all very helpful. I decided for the time being to stick with the pills until I can get clean. Just picked up a blue for the night, literally minutes before posting this. Cheers and happy nods.",1435062529.0

So basically this past year I've rediscovered opiates, after having tried them six years ago and only dabbling on the incredibly infrequent occasion that I came across some. 

In the past few months (like four), people within my circle have often had access to Roxy, leading me to dabble quite a bit more than before as it was available and a member of one of the only classes of drugs I hadn't really familiarized myself with/exhausted my curiosity on. Never mess around with anything other that Oxy, hydro, and the occasional PST.

Now I know the dangers of messing with this stuff. See you guys all the time telling people to turn back while they can, etc. I'm not really sure on where I stand as to if I will use again, but I know when the time to abstain for awhile has come, and it is now. 

What I want to know is if I will experience any WD. I know you guys can't predict everything but this has been (after taking a four day break) my last two weeks of use:

Ive used a total of 7 out of the past twelve days. Each use has been with a break of 2 days, with the exception of the last 3 days, in which I have used all three to deplete my stash. 3 of these uses have been hydros (40mg two of the days, and like 7mg one day just to potentiate a Kpin I popped), one of the has been PST, and the last three have been oxy (two of which were 30mg, the last of which was 40). 

While I have been spacing, I can't telling if the amount of time I've been waiting has been enough for me to even experience WD if I were to have it. Never have withdrawn before. Should I expect any symptoms once I come down after this 40mg and if so, how long would they take to set in? 

I know they will probably be mild at best. I experienced minor stomach pain and the runs this morning, but I believe it to be a result of me munching out the night before, as I felt totally fine otherwise.

What I'm mainly confused about is if my hopping around from hydro, to PST, to Oxy will make it any more or less likely for me to withdrawal, and the proper amount of time necessary to wait to determine if any withdrawal symptoms are to set in. 

Any opinions or advice appreciated. Sorry for all the text",1435043697.0

But this was a particularly stressful Monday, but not because of any outside forces. I gathered up all the cash I had made the previous week serving tables, counted it all up and made a budget for the week to come. I roll my cash up, stick it in my front pants pocket and head out the door on the way to work.

It's been a little over three full days since I last used, I somehow lucked or unlucked my way into a bth connect. Lack of connects was the only thing keeping months between use before that.

The first two days after using were surprising magical, even without the h I felt better psychologically then I had in a long time. The thought that chipping once a month might be a way to release psychological build up entered my mind as it has in the past, but somehow this time felt different. 

I mark my calandar for July 19th and feel confident I will make it. But as it always does the idea pestered me from the back of my mind. Visions of a day high filled my brain while showering and I shook them off knowing if I entertained them for more then thirty seconds they would claim victory and I as a human being would claim defeat.

As I drive towards the bank my body and mind takes note of the money in the pocket and the fact that I am now driving in the opposite direction from my dealer to deposit my weeks earnings. I try to distract myself but every few miles the thoughts once again enter my brain. 

I feel them tiring my will power out blow by blow. I compromise and promise myself a beer with lunch if I only stick to my schedule. I try to think of where breaking it will inevitably leave me and everything I've built back up. These thoughts stave off the barrage for a while, but as soon as I leave the bank and am faced with the direct decision to go to my usual lunch spot or spend my morning off picking up the rationalization that I can still hold to a 8 every 72 plan wins the battle. 

I take out my phone and dial my guy, it rings.....rings....rings and goes to voicemail. Part of me is angry at the lack of response after finally succumbing, but part of me feels free to just get lunch. This doesn't stop me from shooting him a quick text as a last ditch effort. 

I pull into the restaurants parking lot and my phone rings with my guys name shining from the screen like a vacancy sign to a weary traveler. He tells me he's not good currently but should be tonight. Once again an odd cocktail of anxiety and freedom wash over me. 

So here I sit, getting ready for my night of work, thinking about addiction, the mind, life and fate. 

While the option to somehow foil myself now before it gets bad again seems like it should technically be a possibility. 

Fate seems to write a different story, my over awareness of my own mind and how it works shows me the fall before it inevitably happens. 

Like a man paralyzed, forced to watch in horror as the surgeon cuts into his chest not aware that the anesthesia hasn't taken effect. 

I know I won't sabotage myself from getting what I want, what I already imagined would happen. Once given into that imagination it's impossible to strip away. I won't tell any friends, I won't tell my parents, I laugh as I tell my psychologist with a straight face knowing he can't tell a soul due to doctor patient confidentiality laws. 

So there you have it, that's life, that's fate, that's addiction.  ",1435006237.0

Was hit while walking a month ago, have been red flagged for filling prescriptions of Norcos","Okay, so a little backstory. I was walking a half mile down the road to the gas station at 930 in the morning a month ago and someone hit me going about 40mph and left me for dead on the side of the road. They completely split my left femur in two and dislocated the 5th and 5th vertebrae in my neck, which would have left me paralyzed if I didn't have surgery to stop the swelling in my spinal cord.
 I was the only witness and I don't remember shit because they hit me hard enough to break me in half so they never caught who did it. I've got a 15 inch rod holding my left femur together and a plate in my neck keeping the vertebrae in place. Fun times, right?  Shit happens tho, but I've now run into issues almost more frustrating that actually getting hit because of the nature of them.

After getting moved from the er to inpatient I was given two Norco 10s every 4 hours. I was given a 70 count script with the same dosage. Now, I was referred to a clinic for general care and they were supposed to refer me to pain management. About three weeks passed and I had heard nothing.  Now, I'm seeing a lot of doctors and surgeons because of all the shit that's happened, and I would tell them my meds were running low when I was about to run out and they would write me like 6 day scripts to get by til I saw my next doctor. I would tell them about my troubles getting them filled (apparently pharmacists freak the fuck out if you take anything over the daily FDA guidelines for APAP, even tho the doctors seem not to gave any issue giving me the shit in this amount and writing the scripts in the dosages they do). I would tell them about the clinic saying they were going to refer me to pain management but not doing so and my increasing worries that I might end up fucked over because of having so many prescriptions, but none of the doctors really seemed to want to make it their problem, so they just wrote me 7 day scripts to last me until I saw my next specialist and made it their problem. Well, last Thursday the inevitable happened. I had dropped of a script at the pharmacy Wednesday night. I didn't even need it at the time, I still had some of my last script and was just going to pick it up later. Well I end up getting a call from them saying that I had been red flagged and that they tore up the prescription. So now I've got no meds. I've been laying in one spot for the past three days because to move my leg at all hurts like a fucking bitch.

The best part about all this? The clinic that was supposed to refer me to pain management eventually got around to doing it. I happened to ask about it when they called about something else. So I called the place they refered me to and guess what? They wouldn't accept me as a patient because they wouldn't take my insurance. They told the clinic but they never got around to telling me. So I had to go look for my own pain management doctor, which I finally found, but the earliest I could get an appointment was July 10th.

I'm supposed to go see the trauma specialist tomorrow and I'm hoping that he does something for me.  My leg surgeon and my physical therapist have both said i shouldn't be going without any meds right now, so hopefully he thinks the same. When I've got meds I can actually function halfway normally. I've still got to use a walker and have weight-bearing restrictions on my leg and my arms but I can actually do stuff like get out of bed and put on pants without it being a struggle.  The pharmacist said I need to get a doctor to write me a prescription for a narcotic that doesn't have acetomenophen in it (code word for oxys), but I have a hard enough time getting scripts of Norco written and filled. I'm afraid to even ask at this point. It sounds like the red flag is just for having too many scripts of Norcos from like four different doctors in a month timespan, but I don't know. I've never been in this position before.

Has anyone ever dealt with this? What the fuck should I do? Am I just gonna have to suffer until I see the pain management doctor or the 10th? Or is there something I can say to the trauma specialist that can get something done for me before then? Any help would be super appreciated

Sitting in the filth of dried gum, band stickers, cigarette butts, old flyers, dirt and all the sticky stains of the phone booth floor...I try and look casual.  This is a tough sell as only homeless people and impatient junkies sit in phone booths on misty, foggy city days.  Being the latter, I try to make myself as discreet as possible.

A cop coming by would probably stop long enough to harass me so I have my change ready to fake a call.  I also have my student ID which I hand to them while I pretend to look for my driver's license.  This is my polite way of stating, ""I am a student of a prestigious University sir, and definitely not standing here trying to score bags of heroin.""

Phone booths are precious real estate when the rain picks up.  Now the misty droplets are falling in shifting waves from the sky.  There are 3 other phone booths within sight of this one and all of them are being used.  Sometimes I grab the phone like I am about to use it if a person walks by.  Other times I try and look menacing.  But the best strategy is to just sit here like a scuzzball and ignore all eye contact.  

I look at my watch.  Almost 15 minutes.  C'mon man, call me back!  My mind races over the number.  Did he write it down wrong?  Did I mumble a digit?  What the fuck is taking so fucking long?  Ok, relax.  I fish around in my pockets for some matches to light the damp cigarette I stashed behind my ear.

""Excuse me?"", comes a cheerful voice from above, ""I need this phone ok?""

Fuck!  I look up into the smiling face of an elderly Asian woman.  

""Oh I'm almost done.  Just one more call...""

""I've been watching you.  You're not using the phone"" she states.  

A no nonsense elderly lady.  The kind of lady that makes everyone wait as she argues with the bus driver over $.15 on her fare.

""Yeah but I am using it-""

""You're sitting there which is fine but I need the phone!  You can have it back when I'm done.  C'mon!  Let's go!""

I look at her in disbelief.  I'm about 6'2 with a stringy black mohawk that goes past my shoulders.  In black boots and my spiked leather jacket I usually get a pass from annoying old people. This lady, however, could give give a fuck.  But I am suffering acute opiate withdrawal.  So fuck losing that sliver of hope that the goddamn dopeman will call me back on this very fucking phone.  No way will I give it up.  

""No!  Trust me"", I growl standing up.  ""You do NOT want this fucking phone!""  

I try to look intimidating and she just stares me down like a yapping dog.  And she is right.  That's all I am.  But then the phone rings.  Triumphantly I grab it.

""Hello?""

""Where are you?""

""Near the Bay Mart on 24th and Valencia.""

""By the church or the pizza place?""

""Pizza.""

""I'm there.""

And he hangs up.  I step away from the phone the lady pushes past me and starts dropping change into it.  I have lost my shelter so I stand in the cold drizzle smoking my cigarette.  Funny how terrible a cigarette tastes when you're cold, sick and desperate.  Just a little ball pushed around on foil and this could be a bright, sunny day with a delicious cigarette.  But it's not.  The wind stabs right through my leather and jeans.  I shiver in my boots trying to keep the shakes under control but I am losing my grip.

I feel like I'm in a different world as I listen to the lady softly speak Chinese behind me.  Such a hypnotic sound.  I stare into traffic too long and too hard lost in my mind.  My life lately has been like a book where I skip chapters to the part where I get high again.  Right now I am staring at the text without any comprehension.  Some faces in cars stare back.  Do they wonder about the guy on the corner looking out into the street?  I shake myself out of this mad vision and come back to the grim reality of this life. 

Caesar pulls up in his orange 70's Chevy Malibu.  I approach the car and am surprised it's just him.  Usually he has a partner so he doesn't have to touch the drugs or money.  I peer into his car and smell beer, cologne and marijuana.

""Two"", he says.  

I hand him the money.  He drops the bags into my hand.  Done.  But he is staring behind me.  I look and see the old Asian lady glaring at us.  Her chin is up defiant.  Shit.  

""Thanks"", I say and start to leave.

""Whoa, hold up.  Who's this fucking bitch right here?"", says Caesar loudly pointing at the old woman.

""Just some old Chinese lady.  Look I'll see you-""

""HEY!  WHAT THE FUCK YOU LOOKN' AT?!""

The lady waves her hand at us like she is shooing away a cat and hisses something in Chinese at us.

Caesar laughs, reaches under his seat and pulls out a gun.  The dull black metal is so close to me I feel my stomach drop as I back away.  To my disbelief, Caesar points it at the old lady.  Jesus.  Now her eyes show fear.  She drops the phone.  I watch it dangle and swing as her mouth opens and closes.  No sound comes out.

""I suggest you run!"", snarls Caesar.  But she stands there, rooted to the spot.  As she starts to shake Caesar bellows, ""RUN!""

And she does.  She stumbles down 24th towards the Bay Mart.  An old lady awkwardly running is a terrible thing to see.  Caesar laughs, puts the gun back under the seat.  People are looking at us.  Some are pretending that didn't just happen.  Most people are edging away.  

""You better run too man"", Caesar smiles malevolently at me, ""Unless of course you want to ride with me?""

""No thanks.  I gotta go""

And I turn and walk away.  It takes every ounce of of my willpower to just walk and not run.  I can hear his car idling.  He does not drive away.  I close my eyes hoping I don't hear it or feel it.  And I just keep walking.",1434995719.0

He did take all my dope but left my cash so now my buddy wants to fight me over 40 bucks even though he drove my car to the hospital to get me out.

I let it tar up and as I got towards the center I noticed a large area of inconsistency that looked like brown granules. I tasted the granules and they were for sure brown sugar or sugar that was dyed brownish from the dope. I could easily remove 90% of the sugar without losing any dope just by picking it out with something pointy. I just wanted to let everyone in the area know. I don't IV but I'm sure putting this in your veins isn't the best. Smoking it is also probably pretty bad.

_____________________________________


     It's a drizzly Sunday morning. He wakes up sick. It's not too bad, but it's there. He knows it's only going to get worse... just a matter of time. The rest of the world has been awake for hours. They're at their jobs. They're out doing whatever the fuck it is that normal people do.

     His stomach is churning. All Jason wants to do is go back to sleep. Sleep forever.

     He goes downstairs. His mom and dad are sitting in the living room. Mom is watching some home improvement show on TV. Dad is reading a book.

     ""Good morning."" Jason says.

     ""Good afternoon."" His dad says back.

     He's a grown man but he lives with his folks. He's been living there since he got out of prison a couple months ago. He wouldn't be able to pay rent even if if he did live on his own. Every penny goes into his arm. His family are great people, though. Always so supportive no matter how hard he fucks up. And he fucks up hard.

     He steps out onto the front porch and lights up a cigarette. Takes a drag and his guts revolt. There's no food in his stomach to come back up and it hurts like a motherfucker. He takes a quick step to the banister and lets the yellow shit ooze out his lips. Dry heaves. Feels like someone just took a baseball bat to his torso. Burns his throat almost as bad as the time he drank bleach to pass a drug test. The yellow pudding slides down his tongue and lands on his mom's white roses. Plant food; it'll help them grow. He flicks the rest of the smoke into the ashtray and goes back up to his room.

     He punches a number into his phone. He might be the only person on the planet that still uses an old-school flip phone. He likes them better. Robby answers on the other end of the line.

     ""What's up man?""

     ""Nothin'. You don't sound too hot. You sick?""

     ""Yeah. You gonna score today?""

     ""I'm broke, dude. Ricky ain't answering his phone, anyways.""

     ""Fuck.""

     ""You still got that hipster bitch's phone number? The one you scored from Friday night?""

     ""Yeah, but why? Her dope sucks ass.""

     ""You wanna rob her?""

     There's a pause on the line. But only for a second.

     ""Yeah dude. Fuck yeah. Let me call her.""

     Robby laughs. ""I was thinkin' about that shit this morning. Why not, ya know? She's just some spoiled ass college bitch. She ain't scary. What's she gonna do, kick our asses?""

     Now Jason laughs. But, it's more of a sick chuckle. ""Yeah, right. She won't do shit. Good fuckin' idea, man. How much you wanna get her for?""

     ""Shit, man. Shoot for the moon!""

     ""Hell yeah. I'll call you back in a minute.""

     Jason hangs up and looks through his phone to find contact: ""Hipster Bitch.""

     He calls the number.

     ""Hello?""

     ""Hey, this is Jason... I scored from you with Emily on Friday night...?""

     ""Hey, what's up?""

     ""Are you around right now?""

     ""Yeah. What you need?""

     ""How much for a ball?""

     ""Two-Seventy. But I only got two grams right now""

     ""That's fine. I'll just grab that. Where you at?""

     ""Well, hold on. I got the ball. Just meet me down south in half an hour.""

     ""Word. I'll call you soon.""

     Hangs up. Punches Robby's number back in.

     ""What's the word?""

     ""She says she's got a ball, but it sounds more like it's only gonna be two grams.""

     ""Fuck it. You coming to get me?""

     ""Yessir."" Jason is grabbing shit from his dresser: wallet, keys, smokes.

     ""You got a clean point for me?""

     ""Yeah. See you in five.""


     Jason pulls into Robby's driveway. He drives a black two-door Honda Civic. Robby is walking out the front door and jumps in the car... laughing.

     ""So, we gonna get this bitch?"" Robby asks.

     ""Fuck yeah. Good goddamn idea. How you thinking of doing it?""

     Robby pulls a wad of twenty dollar bills out of his pocket. ""Check this shit out."" He unrolls the twenty on top to reveal just a bunch of paper inside of it.

     ""Ha!Ha!"" Jason laughs. ""Fuckin' smart.""

     ""I figure I'll jump in her car and tell her I need to check out the piece first. Maybe I'll act like I forgot the money in the car and we'll burn. If that doesn't feel right, I'll hand her this real quick and bail ASAP.""

     ""Fuckin' A! You got it down to a T.""

     ""Got that right, buddy. If we're gonna do this, we gotta know how it's gonna play out.""

     ""What if she's got someone with her?""

     Robby is staring out the window, thinking. ""Depends on who it is...""

     ""Yeah...""

     ""Like, if it's her hipster-ass boyfriend, same game plan. If it's some big ass black dude... like the dude she gets the shit from... then I'm not gonna do it at all. I'll say I forgot the money at home or something and we'll just get out of there looking like dopesick idiots.""

     ""Right on. Yeah, we don't wanna fuck with nobody that's gonna beat our asses or mark my car or some shit.""

     ""Hell naw. Just play it cool. We got a good plan. We'll play by ear what we got to. I have a good feeling about this, though. I think it's gonna go smooth as silk."" 

     The car rolls down the street. Robby lights up a cigarette and the smoke fills Jason's nose. His guts start to groan again. He rolls down the window and sticks his head out.

     ""Shit, man."" Robby says.

     Nothings coming up Jason's throat. Dry. The car starts to veer out of it's lane onto the other side of the road. There aren't any cars coming, but fear jumps onto Robby's face. He reaches over, grabs the steering wheel and pulls it back.

     ""Fuck, Jason!""

     Jason doesn't say anything. He's still heaving out the window. A little bit of water and chunks of food finally come up and splatter onto the side of the car. He gurgles up an apology and pulls his head back into the window. Takes the wheel back from Robby.

     ""You ain't lookin' so good, homie."" says Robby, still dragging on his cigarette.

     ""I ain't fuckin' good. I'm fuckin' sick. Aren't you?""

     ""Nope. I saved a shot for the morning. Your dumbass still can't do that? Save a little bit of dope for a wake-up?""

     ""Well man, I wasn't planning on scoring today. I really shouldn't be. I should have stopped on Friday, man. You know I could get popped with a drug test anytime next week.""

     ""Yeah, I do know. I don't know what the fuck you're thinking."" Robby says, flicking his unfinished smoke out the window.

     ""I don't know either, man. I really don't.""

     ""How long is your probation for?""

     ""Five years.""

     ""Yeah, that means five years prison time if you get caught dirty.""

     ""I know. Trust me, I fuckin' know. What do you want me to do?""

     Robby throws up his hands. ""I want you to fucking kick! I care about you, brother. I want you to stop doing this shit so they can't lock your ass up again. This shit ain't worth your freedom.""

     ""Okay, I'm done. I quit. No more dope... So, you wanna just walk from here?""

     They both laugh.

     Jason turns the car onto a back-road highway. Texas is full of these highways. One or two lane roads that are out of the way of any real signs of civilization. No stop lights. No gas stations. Just the sprawling green hill country scenery. The afternoon's dreary breeze ruffles the grass that carpets the hills that roll for endless miles. There are barely ever any other cars on these highways. It seems like it's just you. Just you and the road. These highways are a purely Texas asset. You feel like you're the only person for miles. And maybe your tires feel a little closer to the road. Maybe you feel a little closer to the road. Like it could be a long lost friend or a relative that you don't talk to much. But what the best part about these highways is... in Jason and Robby's minds, at least... what's really great about them is that there are never any cops on these roads. Currently, Jason is pushing the needle up through eighty mph. Robby is grinning. It feels like freedom. 

     Jason gets out his phone and calls the hipster-dealer-girl. She answers on the second ring. A good sign.

     ""Hey, where are you?"" she asks.

     ""We're coming down 2424. Where do you want us to go?""

     ""There's a doughnut shop on South Bowie Ave. It's called ""Gerald's."" The parking lot is really chill, so just meet me there and one of you can hop in my car.""

     ""What are you driving?""

     ""It's a green Chevy Impala. How far are you?""

     ""Maybe ten minutes.""

     ""Okay, about the same for me.""

     ""See ya soon."" Jason says, hanging up. He raises his voice up an octave, ""The parking lot is really chill."" He laughs.

     ""Did she really say that?"" Robby asks, grinning.

     ""Yup.""

     ""What a dumb cunt. She probably thinks she's so tough cause she sells dope.""

     ""Probably.""

     ""Well, we're gonna show her how tough she is.""

     ""Shit yeah. And come up like John Gotti""

     As the car comes around a turn, the city appears before them. It's almost as if a city skyline just materializes in the middle of Nowhere, Texas. One minute you're a country boy, the next you're a city boy. Huge highways bend in and out of downtown. Bridges traverse a river that everyone calls ""Springs Lake."" Normally on a summer afternoon, the lake would be filled with boaters. Today it's empty as light rain makes ripples on it's surface. Downtown looks dead. With nobody out walking the streets, you'd swear it was a ghost town. The grey clouds overhead give off an ominous feeling. Like, maybe things aren't as simple as they seem. Like you should be worried.

     Light raindrops plop onto the windshield. Jason flicks the wipers on. They seem to mock him by spreading a scummy film across the glass. Makes it hard to see the road ahead. Jason squints his eyes to see through the haze. A pair of faint red lights pop into existence in front of the car. The lights seem to be moving towards them.

     ""Shit!"" Robby shouts. ""Stop, man!""

     Then Jason realizes: brake lights.

     ""Oh, fuck!"" Jason slams on the brakes. He's gripping the steering wheel so tight his fingers are going pale. An SUV takes form around those two red lights... and it's getting close. Really fuckin' close. Jason jerks the steering wheel to the left and his car swerves around the SUV. It only clips the back bumper by a hair. Jason straightens the car back out into the next lane. He checks out the mirrors to see what's going on with the SUV. The driver has a scowl on his face and is staring Jason down.

     Robby has his head turned around, checking out the SUV himself. ""That dude is pissed,"" he says.

     ""Yeah... I can see that."" Jason snaps back. The SUV is changing lanes to get behind them.

     ""Lose this fool."" Robby says.

     ""Mmhmm."" Jason steps on the gas and flicks on his right blinker. The entrance for the main freeway is coming up.

     Sure enough, the SUV flicks on it's blinker and follows Jason into the far right lane. Jason's Civic is really cruising now. Pushing ninety-five and the freeway entrance is coming up fast. The SUV is right behind them. Jason is eyeing the lane to his left; empty. He's watching the dotted white line as it turns solid. He marks the distance to the concrete barrier between the back-road highway and the on-ramp. Space is getting tight. The SUV is right on their ass. Then time is up.

     Jason takes his foot off the gas and jerks the wheel to the left. He misses the concrete barrier by inches. The SUV cruises up the ramp and onto the freeway. Jason's Civic slows down to the posted speed limit.

     Robby hoots ecstatically. ""Holy fuck, man! Where did you learn that shit?!""

     Jason shrugs. ""I didn't. I was pretty sure that I was gonna kill us."" His forehead is dripping in sweat and his shirt looks like someone just pushed him into Springs Lake.

     ""Eh, there are worse ways to go out. We just gonna take side streets to this doughnut place?""

     ""Sounds good.""

     ""Say, you smell like ass, buddy.""

     Jason just smiles.


     Jason calls the girl as they pull into the parking lot. She says she'll be there in five. Jason backs into a parking spot on the side of the building.

     Gerald's Doughnuts is a dark wooden building that's an off shade of grey-green. On the side they park, there is a patio. The parking lot is nearly full of cars and the patio is crowded with aging hippies and college hipsters.

     ""This joint is jumpin'."" Jason says.

     ""Yeah. They are about to witness the ol' okey-doke.""

     ""The what?""

     ""Okey-doke. A fuckin' robbery. You never heard that shit before?""

     Jason cracks a grin. ""No, I haven't. Sorry bud, but I wasn't born in 1862.""

     ""Whatever man."" Robby says, lighting another smoke.

     ""You gotta smoke that man? It's gonna make me sick.""

     ""Grow some hair on yer nuts. You won't be sick much longer.

     ""If this works out, that is."" Jason says, a grim look in his eyes.

     ""Like I said, man. I got a good feeling about this. It's gonna go perfect.""

     A green Impala pulls into the parking lot.

     ""Is that her?"" Robby asks.

     Jason squints his eyes through the blurry windshield and the grey day beyond. He recognizes the  dope-girl immediately. And she's alone.

     ""Yup. No hipster-ass boyfriend, either."" Jason says.

     The girl pulls into a spot near the front of the parking lot. Jason drops the Civic into drive and pulls out. He can already see the girl giving him a suspicious look. Fuck it. Too late to turn back now.

     Driving toward the front of the lot, Jason pulls the Civic up behind the Impala; blocking it in the parking space. Robby slides the wad of ""twenties"" out of his pocket, cups it in his palm and jumps out of the Civic.

     ""Fuck yeah, man."" Jason says as the passenger door closes.

     Robby opens the Impala passenger door and climbs in.

     ""What's up?"" the girl asks.

     ""Let me check this out."" Robby says.

     She hands him a small plastic shell with a yellow cap. You know those cases that cheap kids' toys come in when you buy them out of a vending machine? That's what this girl put the dope in.

     Robby raises an eyebrow as he weighs the dope with his eyes. ""This is a ball?""

     The girl is looking around nervously. Robby can feel the weakness bleeding from her. This girl should not be selling dope. You could taste the fear on her from a mile away.

     ""Well, let me see it..."" she sputters out, reaching for the dope.

     ""It's okay."" Robby is already opening the passenger door. He slips the fake-cash out of his pocket and slaps it into the girls hand as he's getting out of the car. He sees it click in the girls head. The ol' okey-doke. 

     ""No, wait!"" Her hand shoots out and wraps limply around Robby's wrist. Robby yanks his hand free easily and slams the Impala's passenger door behind him as he strides back to the Civic.

     Jason has been eyeing the flow of traffic on Bowie Ave. A few of the people on the porch of Gerald's Doughnuts have been looking over at the two cars in the parking lot; They are all gonna be looking in a second. Jason sees Robby pacing back to the car and immediately looks left up Bowie Ave. Traffic is clear.

     As soon as Robby is in the seat (but not before he can close the door), the Civic's tires are spinning; screeching. The smell of burning rubber ignites in the air. The Civic jumps out into the street, building speed in nearly a heartbeat. Both junkies are laughing their asses off. High-fiving. Hugging each other.

     ""Fuck yeah!""

     ""Holy shit!""

     ""Dude, that was perfect! Fucking perfect!""

     ""You should have seen the look on that bitch's face when she finally realized what was going down. Like, bitch, you just got robbed!""

     The Civic blows through a red light. A car coming through the intersection slams on the breaks and lays on the horn. Neither of them can stop laughing.

     ""Say, get off this street."" Robby says.

     ""Yeah, good call."" Jason whips the Civic around the next turn. The slick water under the tires causes the car to hydroplane into the next lane as the car slides around the corner. But, the street is empty and Jason guns the engine as he swerves the Civic back into the right lane.

     ""You are seriously the worst fucking driver I've ever met."" Robby says.

     ""Why, thank you.""

     ""Let's find somewhere to fix."" 

     ""That's the second best idea you've had today.""


     Jason pulls the car over to the curb in some suburban neighborhood. There's no one around at all. The shitty weather has kept everyone inside. Jason breaks out a hard plastic case. He pops it open, pulling out a spoon and fresh rigs. ""Let me see that shit."" Jason says.

     ""It ain't no eight-ball."" Robby says, handing Jason the plastic bubble with a big chunk of black tar heroin stuck to the clear edges.

     Jason holds it up to his eye. ""That fuckin' cunt! This can't be more than two grams.""

     ""Yeah, but it was free and we got her ass instead of the other way around.""

     ""Let's split this up."" Jason says, pulling a razor blade out of the black case.

     They cut the piece in two. Robby drops his dope into the spoon first and cooks it while Jason rolls up a cotton torn off a cigarette.

     Jason drops the cotton into the spoon and Robby draws the dark black liquid up into his rig. The liquid-y sucking sound as the last bit of dope goes up into the needle sends elated tingles down both their spines. The moment is coming. The moment that everything disappears. Every problem either of them has ever had. Every inadequacy. Every ounce of rejection and drop of self-loathing. Robby passes the spoon to Jason. He repeats the process. The cotton makes that sucking sound again and a grin crosses Jason's face; anticipating the moment that his brain will melt into euphoria. The moment every shed tear evaporates. He slides the needle under his skin. The moment every heartbreak and ache is mended. All pain disperses. When the only thing that exists is nothing at all.

     Blood pools into the rig and Jason smiles.

After doing some research I found out that B-F is not soluble in pH neutral water. Well one great thing about shootion B-F and 4-FA together is that the 4-FA is as a hydrochloric salt so I don't need to add any citric acid to get the B-F to dissolve. Honestly the mg scale I ordered is coming in today so I haven't really been risking shooting an unknown amount of the B-F. I just worked my way up, however I had a close call last night. After shooting my goofball I came to on the floor of my bathroom, now granted it was just like 10 mins later so it couldn't have been a full blown OD but still scary so I'm just gonna wait til my scale come in to do any more IV B-F. Honestly 4-FA is kinda a mix between MDA and adderall. I haven't really gotten a great rush from the B-F yet, it's def mu-opiate active though, I am waiting til I can measure out a proper dosage later today and I will update",1435079155.0

I rummaged through my medicine cabinet, and found some trammies which were prescribed for my dog. I've been popping one each 20 minutes, and I'm at four pills at this point. Yet I feel very little even though I know that I've had a good high from tramadol a handful of times. 

The only effects I feel right now are pronounced fatigue, and the room is spinning slightly. It's supposed to be 50mg each, and I confirmed that before anything by doing a pill lookup on google. So, I have to ask, are pharmaceuticals prescribed for dogs usually of less intensity? Or do veterinarians sometimes skimp out on drugs or something like that? ",1435221619.0
3b1pe5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3b1pe5/opening_the_gate/,38,https://redd.it/3b1pe5,morbo2000,Opening the Gate,"Someone had placed me on my side which was wise.  Looking down I can see the bed lamp reflecting dimly in a puddle of gastric juices, Jim Beam and beer.  Discovering your vomit is always a curious thing.  More so in a unfamiliar room.  

I sit up and look around.  Someone's guest room.  Comfortable, functional, tasteful.  Family portraits on the wall, a Monet reproduction from his lilies series near the window, a made bed with cushions and a quilt.  On the table is someone's coke.  I thank the Universe for this moment and snort.  It bursts behind my right eyeball and my brain crackles to attention.  I find my jacket and walk out into the hall.

I clean myself up in a bathroom and peek in the medicine cabinet.  Nothing good.  Perhaps the owner is aware of my kind.  Maybe he is one of us.  Or maybe someone like my girlfriend beat me to the punch. 
 
A clock I pass tells me it is 3:33 in the a.m.  The Witching hour.  I hear distant human noises and follow them into a spacious living room.  My boots reverberate off the hardwood floor for this part of the house is silent.  A sharp contrast to events earlier.  Before music blasted, hundreds of drunken voices rose up in unison as a challenge to the alien night sky.  I look outside in the silent gloom.  The pool is full of beer cans, cups, lawn furniture, clothes and towels.  A fountain nymph has been knocked over and beheaded.  Trash is strewn everywhere.  From the amount of smashed wine bottles on the patio it looks like they found the cellar.  Every door and cabinet on the outdoor bar is yanked open and the contents spewed across the lawn.  An outdoor refrigerator stands wide open and is on fire.  The flickering flames make the reflection of my face orange and demonic in the window pane.  

I keep walking.  

The house was locked during the party so inside is another world.  Clean and orderly.  The smells of an unknown family.  Spices, cooking scents and lemon furniture polish.  A gas fireplace cheerfully burns.  The mantle is covered with a nautical clock collection.  An archipelago of Persian rugs over a wooden floor leads me to the theater room where I find my friends.  Dev and Jason are playing Mario Kart while Kym and Melo talk with three guys I saw earlier.  Melo looks up at and grins.

""There he is!""

""I feel..."", I pause because the world blurs for a moment.  It retracts slowly and then pops back into focus.  I rub my face.  ""I feel weird.""

""Yeah you got knocked out"", said Jason leaning into a turn as Dev shrieks something about turtle shells.

Kym stands up and walks over to me.  Tonight she wears a red bandana wrapped around purple hair.  A white crop top, gold belly chain and black jeans with a wide, silver studded belt.  Black boots and her leather jacket.  She recently got her jacket spiked to match mine.  Her leather features the next star chart on the Milky Way traveling away from our solar system.  Kym caresses my cheek which throbs.

""Did I win?""

Kym laughs and kisses me.

""You almost tied?"", offers Dev from the floor.

""Almost babe"", agrees Kym smiling.  ""Not much of a fighter are you?""

""That was my second fight.  The first was was in third grade with Tommy Melkin.""

""Did you win?"" asks Melo.

""No.  I ran away after he hit me.""

Earlier in San Francisco, Dev knocks on our door.  I let her in suspiciously.  When she is alone there are sometimes spirits and otherworldly entities swirling around her.  But she just wanted to take a shower.  Kym allows this so I let her in.  When she comes out she goes into our room to help Kym paint tiny skulls on her nails.  Later Melo comes by.

""Party in Emerald Hills"", says Kym.  

""Where?""

""Emerald Hills.  The Peninsula"" says Kym.  ""Melo we have to hit up a liquor store ok?""

Melo turned 21 first so the poor bastard gets to buy booze for us 20 year olds.  The perk is he always gets drunk for free when he hangs out.  

""It's my friend Annie from school.  She's turning 20 and her parents are in France so...party.  Sorry guys.  These people are kinda weird"" warns Dev.

I look at her.  Dev cuts her hands to draw ritual blood magic circles.  She talks to spirits and old gods.  So I have to ask.

""Weird?""

""Suburb kids.  Gap clothes, Jamba Juice wheat grass purges and frozen yogurt...Trust fund drop outs with thousand dollar Beanie Baby collections"" she offers.

""What? Like sane versions of you Dev?"" says Jason strolling in through the front door.  

He lifts up his shirt and pulls a McDonalds bag from his waistband and dumps it on the table.  He drops next to it and takes out all the coke and heroin he scored across the bay.  

""Not much China white"", says Jason.  ""All tar.  Mexicans have a chokehold on the competition.  Only the biker guys and Vietnamese dudes have powder.  And boy do they know it.""

""Maybe I don't want to go"", says Dev in a small voice.  

We all can see why.  Dev was totally that weird kid that never fit in.  We have always viewed her as our insane friend and just go with it.  But growing up?  That must have been cruel.

""Dev!  Fuck Monkey is playing your friend's party!"" says Kym waving a cigarette around to make her point.  

Kym is obsessed with Fuck Monkey because lately she has been on a disco kick.  Fuck Monkey is a cover band.  Mostly Bee Gees and Abba.  

""Fuck Monkey!"" she emphasizes again as Jason tears the foil.

""But all those people...they were so-""  Dev scrunches into an embryonic ball on the floor with her knees to her chin.  

Her fear of her high school peer group is the first normal thing I have ever seen from Dev.  So I offer, ""We can always go to Slims.""

""C'mon Dev!"", begs Kym rolling her eyes and clutching Dev's filthy orange gypsy skirt.  ""I'm from fucking Danville!  The suburbs suck!  But Fuck Monkey!  Please!""

""Oh fuck you Khadja"", says Dev still frowning.  Then she looks up, ""OK.  Fine.  Let's go but Melo?""

""Hmm?""

""I need the kit.""

And we smoke.  Dev shoots.  The poppy's bloom behind our eyes and time erodes into the Friday night.  We do coke as Kym gets ready and Jason orders a pizza.  Finally, Melo carries Dev's slumped body to the car and Kym drives us south into the suburbs.

""Who the fuck is this bitch?"" yells the largest goddamn talking primate I have ever seen.  

I know who the bitch is.  But this guy?  Holy fucking steroid crazy mutant motherfucking shit!  He's not very tall which makes it worse.  The short ones HATE me.  But he is wide and ridiculously muscular.  His arms and neck are thicker than my thighs.  I walk into this knowing I am truly fucked.

All night this dominate primate man craps on everything.  His name is Baron for fuck's sake.  All he talks about is beating up people.  He sucks down beer after beer.  His face was almost angelic.  Blond curls framing olive green eyes.  But the eyes were dead.  Like a domesticated beast.  Dumb.  Dull.  Reflecting very little human soul.  His chin was like the end of a brick and everything below it was solid.

The band was amazing.  They were dressed like extras from Les Misérables.  Short set but intense with that infectious disco bass.  They played on a lawn that was at least a half acre long broken up by fountains and statuary.  This type of wealth astounds me.  I showed Melo the reproduction of the mosaic depicting Alexander the Great breaking the army of Darius, last king of the Achaemenid Empire.  Japanese koi fish swam over it.  Kym and Dev walk by smoking cigarettes and talking.  Obviously at ease in their childhood surroundings.  They never even glance at the beauty and symbolic power of the Alexander mural.  

Dev knew the house code to the elevator so we could go inside.  On the ground level was a space that housed the car and motorcycle collection.  Ride the elevator down to the underground pool and gym facilities.  Ride up to the atrium entrance.  A spiral stairway led to the bedrooms.  Jason complained loudly about this.

""What the fuck Winchester mystery house?  Elevator to the subterranean pool but not the bedroom?  The architect must have been smoking Mexican tar.  Shit makes you lazy.  Now if he had the ECP he would have built hamster tube connectors for the coked out fuckers who can't stand being trapped in elevators.""

Two smaller houses flank the main compound.  One for each sister.  A family of four would be comfortable in either structure.  I sit in one of these houses and look at yearbooks.  Outside is a swarming cluster fuck of bored college-aged suburban kids mingling under tiki torch lights, swimming and getting wasted on expensive liquor.  In the yearbook I find a freshmen Devika Liora.  A tiny, awkward normal looking girl with a sexless utilitarian haircut.  But a glorious fucking smile.  Sophomore year she has a dyed black goth mushroom hairdo and a scowl.  Junior year she has a shaved head and painted, manic eyes.  No senior picture.  Then I hear trouble outside.

""Who the fuck is this bitch?"" yells the largest goddamn talking primate I have ever seen.

And Kym is toe to toe with the monster yelling back.  

""Fuck you!  Who the fuck do you think you are?  Get the fuck out of here!"" she yells as she throws the contents of her keg cup on him.

The crowd holds it breath as the red cup bounces off his enormous, sloped forehead.  Baron is the biggest asshole for miles and has been King Bully from kindergarten to this moment.  Whoever he was tormenting backed off and Kym filled the spot.  

He gapes at his Tommy Hilfiger shirt in disbelief.  The beer presses the material against his wide chest as I make my way towards the circle.  The crowd sensing violence reacts.

""Hey Baron!  It's all good!  Let it go dude!""

""Hey c'mon man.  Let it go!""

But more frightening:

""Fucking cunt!  Get her Baron!  Get HER!""

As he looks up I stand between them.  His piggy little eyes sparkle.  I see joy as thoughts are processed through the smooth lobes of his brain.

""Sorry"", I say.  ""We're leaving ok?""

And he swings.  I have a half second to drop back as his fist slams into my shoulder throwing me back into Kym.  We both fly back a good three feet and slide across the ground into the scattering stampede of onlooker's feet as they scramble to make way.  I jump up and throw myself at him with no idea what I'm supposed to do.  Baron catches me in midair.  His fingers are like bananas and crush me in the grip as he rears back to beat me.  With useless arms I slam my forehead into his face.  I feel a CRACK and he drops me bellowing.  Now I have chance!  I look up...and wake up sideways on the someone else's couch smelling my stomach contents.

""Cheater!"", shrieks Dev.

Jason dramatically leaps to his feet while tossing the controller in the air and points at her, ""THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!""

""I think I'm gonna puke again"", I announce.

""Have some water"" says Melo offering me a bottle.

""Have you considered the possibility that you may have a concussion?"" asks the Arabic looking kid wearing an O'Neil hoodie.

""I have no idea what happened"", I shrug.

His friend sitting next to him in glasses is rolling a joint and looks up.  ""Baron just started throwing uppercuts into your body and then he clocked you with a right.  Lights out.""

""Ah.""

Kym puts her arms around my neck from behind.  Even this hurts but it's worth it so I sag into her embrace.

""Babe this is Mike"", the Arab guy nods, ""Jeff"", the guy rolling the joint waves his hand as he licks the paper, ""and Parker.""  A chubby Asian kid smiles and nods.  ""Mike dates Annie.  They all go to Santa Barbara.""

I shrug.

""We're in Annie's house"", fills in Kym.

""Oh.  Hey sorry for the ruckus.""

""Oh dude that Baron guy has been a prick since 5th grade.  Steroids made him psycho.  It was awesome you guys took him out.  Asshole wasn't even invited"", laughs Mike.

""Oh yeah?  What happened?""

""Melo hit him with a shovel"", says Dev joining the circle as Jeff lights the joint.

""That guy was huge, I needed something"", grinned Melo. ""Barely slowed him down.  Guy's a beast.  But Jason dropped him.  One shot and he went down.""

""Good thing"", says Jason joining the circle.  ""This chick told me in high school he lifted like 500 lbs.  You do not want to be on the receiving end of that.  His fists are like canned hams.""  

So we smoked.  Kym and I were antsy.  I could feel Dev and Melo were getting there too but Jason looked zen because he was holding and probably enjoying.  

I learned from our new friends that Baron started problems by stealing a keg.  His crew just grabbed one during the band and left.  Then they came back for another one later.  One of Annie's friend's called them out on it and Baron shoved him.  In doing so he bumped Kym who got into it.  Luckily, someone called the cops.

I looked at Mike, Jeff and Parker.  Santa Barbara imparted a laid back beach culture vibe on them.  Like even though it was winter Mike and Parker wore rubber slippers instead of shoes.  Most of the guys at the party had short hair and backwards baseball caps.  These three had shaggy hair like they were debating to grow it out.  They looked as out of place at this party as we did.  

""Jase"", said Kym, ""bump me some love.""

I watch their faces.  Marijuana and drinking is common in their circle.  But I sense Kym was opening a gate these three never saw.  Alert and interested, the Nintendo was forgotten.

""Uhm Kym..."", says Dev looking at Mike.

""Don't worry Dev.  Annie's passed out"" says Mike.  ""What?  Coke?""

""Naw"" says Kym.  ""Coke AND heroin.""

""Whoa!"" says Parker looking at Jeff.  But Mike sits up.

""Is that like opium?""

""Not really"", says Melo.  ""More intense.  Opium is closer to morphine.""

""What...?"" purrs Kym suggestively.  ""You boys want to try?  I am exactly what your mothers warned you about...""

""Kym"" sighs Jason.  ""This is not exactly the best-""

""Hey it's cool!"", says Mike.  ""I'll totally pay if thats what you mean.  I just want to try...""

""Mike!"" says Parker, ""Dude it's heroin.  HER-O-IN!""

""I'll buy some too"", says Jeff.

""Boys!"" smiles Jason rubbing his forehead.  ""Look it's your party, you guys smoked us out and you let us chill here when the cops came.  I'll get you high if you want.""

""I want"", says Mike sitting up.

Kym feeds herself first.  Then I take a bump, Melo, Jason and Dev follow.  We sit there in the unknown house eyes wide open and floating into the other world like a leaf spiraling towards a pond.  I nod and feel myself sinking into still waters.  I watch Kym offer a tiny bump to them.  She rolls the straw across the glass table to Mike.  I stare at the skull painted on her fingernail.

He takes anywhere from 150-240mg a day, pretty much runs out early every month, but somehow manages to finagle himself into correct pill counts and charms his way into making the doctor think he is completely compliant. He called me earlier today saying he just got a bunch of 2mg xanax bars from his friend. I told him like twenty times to be EXTREMELY careful mixing the two. However he still seems hell bent on mixing at least a little bit. What do you think the limit, in terms of how much xanax he can take with his habit is? I would greatly appreciate some help as I do not want my cousin to die. It might kill me (figuratively speaking).

I'll use for 4-5 days on, then take a week or two off. I'm one of those people that started right off with bags, I'd had Vicodin and shit before trying my first stamp, but in small doses for post-operation shit, like ymwisdom teeth. But lately, I have been doing a lot more than usual. My 2 week breaks turned into a few days off. When I'm not using, it's always on my mind. So, I have been making an effort to cut back, if not stop all-together. I was doing well, too. Up until tonight.

I'm a young but, 18 and still living with parents. Don't have my license yet, though I take the test in a few weeks, but that's irrelevant. I cook in a restaurant, and obviously I have to be driven around by my parents to and from work whenever a friend can't drive me. And I work with a lot of junkies. I picked up for the first time from a coworker. I made it like 5-6 weeks without getting high (I say that meaning dope, I smoke lots of pot and do other shit), and was feeling pretty good. That is, u til, my dad stumbles into my work, goes to the back, and starts screaming at me, visibly drunk. He calls me a fuck-up, a loser, and a mistake, threatening to kick my ass. I'm trying to keep my cool, but I've experienced this stupid shit so often, it wears me down. He had to be asked to leave by my boss. After he got kicked out, I could feel everyone's eyes on me. They all think I'm a junkie, which I guess I am, and now they know my family is in shambles. A girl that I work with could tell that I was in a terrible place and offered me a few bags on the front, for really cheap. And, of course, I took it. Only did 3, but they were some of the fattest, strongest bags I've ever done. The stamp was ""Scorpion"". It feels so good, but at the same time, I feel like shit.

Sorry for the wall of text. This post has no meaning, I'm just in a dark place and pretty fucked up. Trying to avoid my problems right now with a fat blunt and a rail of Adderall to compliment the dope, but I've tired of feeling like some kind of monster. It's too much. ",1435201240.0

2.) Go to http://www.giftcardgranny.com/sell-a-gift-card/. Enter in where the gift card is from. This site will tell you which vendors are offering the highest percentage in cash for that particular vendor at that time. I got 90 percent value for my walmart card yesterday. 

3.) Go to vendor site and enter in gift card information. 

4.) Receive quote. Will be the same as the quote from giftcardgranny.com

5.) you will have to enter in a valid credit card/debit card info. This is in case you sell your card to the site and then go and use the actual card and they will fine you a lot of money. Just follow the rules and that obviously won't happen. However you will always need to do this when selling a gift card online. 

6.)Check is mailed to the billing address of the card listed or to a mailing address you put in. Takes 3-7 Business days

7.) Profit


Hope this is helpful. This can be done in any state in the USA with just about any gift card. You don't have to take 30 or 40 percent bullshit from pawn shops. With this method you can get just about all of your money back in a legal way with no hassle and no dealing with scheming people trying to low-ball you. Yes this will take some patience but you get your money and at the end of the day thats what matters. Take care fam. 

**EDIT: got my check in the mail 3 days later so for everyone wondering how long you would have to endure until the money comes, it's 3 days! Now that I know it's 3 days and not 7 i'm even more excited about having found this method and will use it from now on when I have gift cards. I don't get gift cards super often, but I have had them enough times to feel that i've been super ripped off by pawn shops, coin star, and other methods of cashing the gift cards. I'd say the highest rate I ever got was 40 percent and went as low as 20 percent!!! which is just straight up robbery in my mind.**

**Pawn shop employees/Coinstar know people want the cash fast and that some are junkies using it to buy drugs so they low-ball to the extreme. But I can almost guarantee that some places just turn around and use the exact same method that i've outlined above. I really don't see how you would get any higher than 92 percent online or in person unless they were your friend and trusted you and wanted to help you out. I view this discovery as a success because so many things out there in life will beat you down and suck up your money once you're an addict. this just helps people like us to maybe keep a little change in our pockets when we happen upon some gift cards.

The chances of getting ripped off are huge. Yet there's people who use and travel a half days worth to get some. I too have gone 200++ miles to cop. It's exhausting and difficult to do at times. 

Secondly, I guess money would be cool. But it's not my main motivation. I just want to be a dealer than doesn't fuck over, take forever, treats their customers well, and maybe makes a bit of extra cash. Basically, the opposite of what is locally. It's bad enough the dealers are sparse but worse that they are all dicks!

It gets better, I promise. Some legitimate medical reason, sure, keep using and more power to you. 

If you're thinking about starting to use opioids, stick to something like kratom. Hydrocodone is the entry-level to something that is more addictive than every other drug combined (for me). I've spent 95% of the money I've earned/borrowed in the past two years on these godforsaken pills, and I've only become depressed, as my fucking endorphan system doesn't work anymore, and this may take a while to heal.

Recently I drove a 2014 Honda accord. All I thought was ""damn, I'd love to have that car."" I estimate I've spent no less than $25,000 USD (but likely far more), and that car was only 21,000. Fuck my life. I love you all; stay safe.",1435305617.0

He's always had a problem with pills, and he'd always be nodding out. Usually his paycheck would last him until Monday, this time he was broke by Saturday, and ok, yeah, not all that unheard of $500 in 24 hours, sure, whatever. Heroin practically costs the same as pills here, at least from what I've seen.  
  
Thing is, 3 months ago, one of the main dealers in the closest city over people usually pick up in started pushing dope, and the local meth heads in our town started in on our area moving it right along. My brother is a big customer of theirs.   
  
The say they're best friends...anyone that's been in the game as long as some of us knows what that means (that he's their best customer) my brother on the other hand...huge habit, not so street smart. They run out of pills? Here, try some heroin they say...lately he's been nodding harder and harder, his attitude towards the family has gotten worse, he's been burning through his paycheck quicker than ever. The couple he used to get d's from cheaper than the others haven't heard from him in a couple months...matter of fact...they haven't heard from him since the assholes have been pushing dope.  
  
Now, don't get me wrong...I have nothing against heroin, we're all addicts, but for lack of a better word, my brothers a dumbass. he doesn't understand moderation, he doesn't understand doing test shots, he doesn't understand how wildly different batches of heroin can vary from one to the next. To him, it's all the same. Pills were good for my brother in that aspect.  
  
I've saved my asshole brothers life twice now because I caught it in time and got him medical attention. I don't want to lose my brother to this shit. My mothers sick, my father has heart problems...they couldn't handle it...I'm afraid if something happens to him, one of them is going to die soon after.   
  
They understand my drug use isn't a huge issue right now, we actually talk, and I'm honest with them about it. I've also told them if I'm going to quit, that I need help. They also understand my medical problems. I don't use that often anymore as it is, I take suboxone when I can't, and starting next month I'll be getting a legitimate script for it and start getting my shit together again since I'll be able to pass a drug test with a prescription and won't have to worry about being sick, drugs no longer take the front seat in my life. I see the heartbreak in my parents eyes every time my brother walks out the door and don't know if he's going to come back, end up in jail, get a knock at the door, etc.  
  
Tl;Dr - Anyway, just be careful guys. I know we all love our drugs, but try to remember that most of you have a family that loves you, and would hate to see something horrible happen to you...even if you can't stand each other...I can't really give a tl;dr for this but if you read it, cool, if not, that's cool too! Honestly I just needed to vent.   
  
Tl;Dr Part 2 - I took some brownies out of the oven before I started typing this so they should be cool by now. Toothache aside, I need the comfort food...and brownies made by substituting vegetable oil with coconut oil are fucking amazing...seriously, try it sometime. The only thing missing from them is caramel. I fucking love caramel. If I had some heavy cream I'd make my own. Did I ever tell you guys I'm a fucking boss in the kitchen?

It's basically the same as saying ""I have stronger will power then every single opiate addict that ever has lived, is living and will live"". Instead of just thinking of it from your own point of view ""it wont happen to me"" look at it from other peoples views ""am I really stronger then every other addict in the world?"".

3b51kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3b51kw/fuck_da_police/,33,https://redd.it/3b51kw,squadde,Fuck Da Police," So today I experienced something I never imagined happening to me. Two cops straight up violated my rights. Here's the low down on the down low:



head to the city early today as I was very sick and had work today. my money cleared in my account in the wee hours so I left as soon as possible to cop. I get to town pretty early and no one was out and I couldn't get ahold of my regular guy. I go into a bodega to grab a drink and talk to a dude that is willing to serve me. we leave the store and head to his trap house. he lets me in and grabs me my work and we end up chilling. turns out he is a fellow user but also is one of the heaviest hustlers on the block (and coincidentally my main dudes actual brother). we hang out get high and go to a nearby mission for free breakfast. he told me he had to go pick up and asked if I wanted to come; of course I agreed. we walk about 8 blocks and he sees his people and tells me to wait while he conducts his business. I go into another corner store to grab something else to drink and out of my peripheral I see a cop making a turn onto the street we were on (a main road in the city). I go to the counter and am about to pay for my drink when I feel a hand grab me and pull me away. I look only to see its the cop. he takes my drink and my money and takes me back outside and tells me to put my hands on the wall to which I *respectfully* reply, ""officer why am I being searched? I haven't done anything""



Mr. Officer tells me he knows I'm carrying something. I continue to tell him this is an unlawful search and I had not done anything to warrant such a thing. I get told to ""shut the fuck up and keep my hands on the wall""  they continue to search me and find about half my bun and promptly handcuff me and put me in the car. they drive around asking me questions and I explain that I had already had it in my possession and didn't cop it in the city. he pulls over and tells me that ""I work for him"" and that they'll keep the dope as evidence against me if I don't help them make an arrest. they then let me out and slip a business card in my pocket. 



flash forward a few hours later when I'm not as mad. I call the number and tell the cop that he didn't have a right to search me and asked what he planned on doing. he said he wasnt going to charge me but since he did me a solid by not arresting me I should do him a solid if I ever get any info. What the actual fuck man. those cops were dicks and pulled some incredibly illegal shit. I just wanted to share this story and get feedback, similar experiences, advice, etc.  I've just never had my rights abused so badly. sorry for the massive wall of text. 



But thanks to a friend and fellow redditor I did aquire another bun and feel good. sorry for any typos, I got the pirate eye on the bus. I hope everyone's day was at least a tad better than mine

Maybe not super interesting because I'm not a smoker, almost never had pleasure smoking. I just don't get the swallowing movement... I just got high a few times on weed. But don't worry for me, I like mushrooms!

Travelling in Teheran during the ramadan. Friend is a big guy who did the war with Irak. From a ""religious"" family (i mean, it's Iran right), he now enjoy his family, weed and vodka.

Anyway the first day i see him smoking opium with a friend in the kitchen, with a stroke that they put in a small bottle of water. I cannot describe precisely because I never smoke so didnt care that much about the whole processus. I tried. We looked like crackheads.

Friend take us to the mountains. He and his friends have a small house there, absolutly no one around. We pass the day looking at the trees, eating good food, smoking weed. I actually got high. For sure that was some good weed (I don't know what's the right term for it, don't blame me). When it gets dark my friend invites us to go up the hill and to collect dry wood there. I think it's a joke because there is no fucking wood, but we do search in the dark and gather this damn wood.
Friend comes back with an old traditional pipe, a very beautiful object, and a big round opium ball. Feels like something a kid would play with. We make a fire next to the swimming pool. There is a very special movement to get with the pipe; like blowing blowing blowing blowing blowing swallowing. I think I did my best but didnt feel anything special. One other friend who's a smoker was like ""meh"" but an other one got high, he went to the swimming pool and was standing like a dead body in the water, with the iranian dude swimming naked around him. Keep in mind it was pitch black under the iranian sky.

Someone said opium brings childhood memories. Friend says he had one. End of the story.

Few days later we are with two guys in Isfahan in their car, they pick up girls and the girl in the back start masturbating the guy. What ?


Iran is an amazing country. Don't go search opium nor alcohol by yourself. It's dangerous.

This salt is soluble in water, and will dissolve within the tea. Then add in lemon juice or one of those Emergen-C vitamin packs. This will add in more citric acid as well as vitamin C, or ascorbic acid. This will acidify the solution more, making our alkaloids very water soluble.

You all are great people but I'm at rock bottom. Now I have that felony warrant and  bench warrant for skipping court from not going for my child support... 

Also to all the idiots who call me a deadbeat.. I fucking pay my child support I got in the arrears last year from dealing with medical issues.. When I do work I pay thank you. I see my kids, I love my babies. 

Anyways.. I'm off to get clean then turn myself in for the warrants. It's going to be a rough couple months but I need to do this for me. 

9 years is too fucking long. I'm tired of this life I'm at rock bottom. Again you guys are amazing I'll keep everybody posted on what's going on when I can get access to my phone or a pc before I turn myself in after rehab. 

Stay safe everybody it's time for me. I don't want to come back and see a bunch of people OD'd so please stay safe everyone.

I'm not sure if the same people are around, but I'm sure there's people that want to play. 

I'm going to be setting up a 12 man 1pt PPR league and I will post full scoring once it's set up. I'd like to get some opinions on what y'all would like to play but I've found this setup to be fun. 

* 12 team  
* 1QB 
* 3WR 
* 2RB, 
* 1TE, 
* 1FLEX, 
* K/DST 
* 1 pt PPR, standard scoring otherwise
* Bonus Pts: 
* rushing/receiving/passing yard milestones 
* 40yrd rush touchdown 50yrd rec touchdown

So sign up here in the thread and I'll send invites this weekend. a yahoo email is easiest. I prefer yahoo over nfl/espn. 

Post suggestions / feedback here too. Any questions Pm me :)

I've been using 30mg Roxicodone ""blues"", as well as other forms of oxycodone and forms of hydrocodone, codeine, and tramadol for over two and a half years now, fluctuating between regularly and barely since. Used 2-5 times a week or so from this past October until March/April. But I've swallowed and snorted a lot of blues, with varying imprints (mainly the A 215 ones and 54 199 ones).

I bought pot from my pot dealer several weeks ago, he had a single 30mg blue that he wanted $20 for. Usually it takes two or three of them for me to nod, varies depending on ROA, but he only had one. I hadn't had any blues, and very little opioids in general, for around two months prior.

So, I snorted most of and smoked the rest of what was sold to me as a 30mg Roxicodone tablet, and it was round and light blue and scored on one side with a 30 above the score like I've had before, but the ones I've had before also had an M with a box around it on the reverse side. I didn't feel anything from the pill, usually snorting 30mg of oxy gives me a mild buzz, this did not, and I hadn't had any opioids for almost a week prior. I also noticed the absence of any kind of drip or what not, usually I get a very minimal and not really unpleasant drip, but a small drip nonetheless.

Counterfeit or...? Dude is supposedly getting more blues, and also some Xanax, soon, and I'd really love to buy several of both, but now I think that they'll probably be fakes.

If this is not the correct way to do this sorry, am still learning reddit site

My love of pain pills started with painful periods have had since my teens. I'd chew Panadeine Forte/Nurofen Plus, never more than the recommended dose.


I put my back out 2 years ago and was given a long script for Tramadol. It was like my miracle drug, helped my back pain, period pain, depression. I continued taking it once a month for a few days with my period, to get some pain and depression relief. It was my monthly 'treat'.


My Tramadol script eventually ran out and I went back to the doctor and explained I need this drug for my period pain (didn't tell him about the antidepressive effect). However this GP does not want to extend my script now, so I am now stuck with OTC Nurofen Plus only. 


I got a new boyfriend and moved to Redfern (Sydney). Turns out he was a recovering/relapsing addict. He is in NA and would slip up every 2/3 months or so. From meeting him I was able to make some connections to get Oxys and twice now I've IV'd heroin with him when he relapsed (I would have smoked but he said to get true experience IV is the only way). It was obviously magical, all depression and pain disappeared. I have been sick both times during this experience with vomiting, so  my tolerance level is low.


I have since managed to get a few Oxys and am chipping at those, as have broken up with my boyfriend and terrified of my connection drying up and having no more solid connects. I would ideally want continue with my Tramadol and use them only a few times a week to keep my tolerance low and addiction at bay. I do think about heroin a lot now, the cravings especially on my low level days is always in the back of my mind. But have managed to not become addicted to opiates, as I don't have physical withdrawal, only psychological withdrawal at this point.


MY Q: I have told my psychiatrist (have bipolar 2) about ad hoc opiate use for period pain. If I reveal the full extent of my 'recreational habits' to the doctor, would I possibly be a suitable candidate for suboxone? I believe taking a small amount could be beneficial for me and stop me using pills purchased on the street, or incorrectly dosing heroin.  


If I lay this bare with the pdoc will they help me or just say to go to NA? I don't think NA is the right option for me, am not physically addicted and my ex attends, there are some dangerous characters there who are a worse influence. Although I could possibly make better connects there...


Any advice or experiences (especially from an Aussie medical perspective) will be most appreciated.

lemme explain, the only other opiate ive ever done besides black tar was hydrocodone and that was when i got my wisdoms removed and by then i was already smoking hella tar everyday even post surgery when they tell you not to smoke. i started doing heroin when one night, towards the end of a heavy crystal meth and xanax binge, i called my weed dealer looking for something new. specifically i wanted ""oxycontin"" lol i had heard about the OC's and my thing was trying new drugs so i wanted to give em a try. i told my dealer what i wanted(oxy) and he was like ""bro i dont got oxy, but i got something better, i got the real thing, i got the shit they make oxy out of"" (LOL) SO I Proceed to drive to his house where i buy my first dub of black tar heroin and listen to him try to explain how to smoke it off foil. i learned suprisingly quick and i loved it. smoked that shit daily for years only recently have i switched to the needle. but what im sayin is i started right off directly with dope, 5 or so years later, still using dope just shooting half gram shots now lol 

dont get me wrong, i would LOVE to try some dilaudid or oxymorphone fuck even some normal oxycodone would be nice. ive NEVER done a roxy 30 and i want to so bad!! i wanna shoot one to compare the rush to that of dope. ive never even done morphine. all the opiates I've ever consumed are hydrocodone, diacytlmorphine (heroin), suboxone(for detox), and methadone(for detox). i hear some people talk about how all they can get is pills and finding dope is hard lol my spots the opposite. but anyways.
just finished a baaaaby, yet suprisingly fat cotton shot, took 1 mg of xanax, bout to smoke some fiiiiire ass shatta!!! i love wax anyone else on here lovvvve dabbing with their opiate of choice?! anyways, im out!!! hope everyones night is going dope, and if it isn't, I'm sending good vibes and junkie jesus AND normal jesus your way if you want/need em too!!

3bd7g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3bd7g2/my_story/,20,https://redd.it/3bd7g2,JuicyJay,My story,"Since I just typed the longest most detailed account of my story on /r/drugs I figure I will post it here as well as it is about my journey to addiction and where I am now.

Prepare for the longest post ever. Here's my story. 

I first tried opioids when I was 15. I took probably 5mgs of oxycodone and sat and played WoW for something like 8 hours straight. It was absolutely 100% content and euphoric sitting there for that whole time. Before that, I smoked weed semi-regularly and drank on occasion, and at that point I definitely enjoyed weed the most. After that experience opioids were by far my favorite. Luckily I didn't have any connections other than my sister who had obscene amounts of money (her boyfriend was a huge pot dealer who had the dankest weed back in like 2007, before dispensaries were around and most of the weed was mids from Mexico) . I'm talking like $900,000 deals. So she had basically unlimited money (He's in prison now though). 

So this all started semi-regular use of oxy 30s. I tried snorting them and fell in love with that. That was the first thing I ever snorted. Of course at that point I believed I was invincible and I wouldn't get addicted. I was special. I was about 16-17 when my sister's boyfriend went to jail and she moved back home. Actually he really kicked her out before that happened. She had developed a very nasty cocaine/crack problem, and was drinking heavily and taking oxy 30s all the time. I honestly loved my sister at this time because she would give me all the fantastic weed I wanted, buy me alcohol, give me 30s whenever she had some. She was the shit for a 17 year old. Everyone at school knew I could get the best weed and alcohol when I needed to, she would even deliver it to me for free. Me and my best friend at the time started getting into the 30s a little heavier. I had a job that I had saved up like $1500 because I never really had to pay for anything.

Then like I said, her boyfriend kicked her out and she moved home. He went to jail and the money started to run out for her. So of course having all this money saved (and getting $500 or so for graduation) I slowly started tapping into it all my senior year and the summer afterwards. It was this point my sister got really really bad into the crack and opioids. I remember Christmas eve my senior year she wanted to go, ""see her friends at a bar,"" and she was drunk as shit, so I told her I'd drive her. She had me go all the way to a really sketchy place and told me she was getting 30s, which of course I was excited about. When we got home I asked for some and I remember asking for some, she reluctantly agreed and said ""I shouldn't even be giving you this."". It was a tan powder crushed up in a dollar bill and she gave me a tiny line. I snorted it and felt just like I did on oxy (so I'd thought at the time). I later realized that was the first time I tried some Baltimore raw heroin. 

So I still believed I was special and couldn't get addicted to it, and at this point I was smoking weed every single day. So I graduated, got into university of Maryland, College Park and kind of forgot about doing any opioids with any sort of frequency. Still smoked weed every single day, drinking on weekends and doing normal college things. After my freshman year of college, I went home for the summer. I still loved my sister a lot, and she still smoked a lot of crack. My parents and my other sister were being pretty hard on her and I felt really bad that she had nobody to trust and talk to in my family, and we had always been really close (I was so naive I thought she was just the most awesome person in the world because she gave me anything I wanted, I should have known it was just the drugs). 

Because we were really close still, we sort of became partners in crime. That summer I came home and started hanging out with her over her friends house that she smoked crack at constantly. I first tried coke, then not even a week or two later I smoked crack. It was absolutely the most exhilarating high I have ever tried. Instant energy, super-euphoria, that sweet sweet ringing in my ears. Within a few weeks I was going there almost every single day. There was a guy there that sold and smoked a lot of coke/crack almost all the time, and he absolutely loved my sister. She loved that she had someone close to her to share it with, so I was getting a lot of it for free. But sometimes I had to go pay for it myself when he wasn't there. I also had a pretty high paying job canvassing (going door to door) for a home improvement company selling windows, gutters, siding and such. I was making $13/hr and $50 for each person I got on board.

I was already smoking crack every day, and doing heroin to come down at the end of certain nights, but it wasn't my DOC so more often that not I would just have crack and stay up all night tweaking. One paycheck, I made $1400. I spent that in about a week on crack. I remember going to the atm 4-5 times a day getting $40-$60 each time. I still believed I was pretty much invincible. I was absolutely delusional believing I didn't have a problem. Mostly because I went back to school that fall and resumed just smoking weed and doing all the normal college things. I thought it was really that easy to stop doing hard drugs. So skip ahead to next year (nothing exciting really happened my sophomore year of college. My sister even stopped smoking crack so much (it was an every now and then thing).

So Christmas break my junior year of college, me and my sister started doing opioids again. We would drive into Baltimore and buy 5 scramble pills (really cut dope that comes in capsules that are supposed to be better for IV. We would go every single day and I would split one of these with her, which still got me higher than a 30 would and they were only $10 each. I went back to school after winter break and experienced my first withdrawal, though I didn't notice at the time. I was restless and couldn't sleep and just chalked it up to not sleeping in my comfy bed at night, or just a change of scenery. It didn't last more than a night or two so I didn't think anything of it. 

It all went downhill when I started selling weed. Me and my roommate had a great connect in New Jersey and started getting qps to sell at school. We were smoking a ton of weed for free which was absolutely awesome. The trouble came even our connect asked if we wanted to sell 30s for him. We didn't have enough money but he told us he would front us 50 of them for $20 each. Needless to say we jumped the fuck on that deal without even thinking. We each did one before we started driving home and that was that. We started going crazy with them, barely selling any at all. We were paying for most of them ourselves, and started to get behind with payments. Now I loved opioids, but my roommate really wasn't a big fan of them before this all went down. He absolutely changed his mind on that pretty quickly though.

I came up with the brilliant idea to drive to Baltimore (~ an hour from college park) and get heroin instead. We started going every few days and coming back with $60-$100 of dope. We were absolutely addicted. Neither of us realized until about a week before finals, when we didn't go for like 2 days and didn't have anything else (we did actually sell the 30s, but we spent a lot of that money on dope because we were too lazy to go to the atm or something stupid, and promised to pay it all back). Both of us were in withdrawal, and I knew what was happening with it this time. So we both said fuck it and vowed to get off the shit after finals were over. We had so much work to do it was just something we couldn't deal with at the time. So we kept doing dope, finals ended, my roommate moved back to New York where he had no connections, and I moved back to Baltimore with all the connections.

That was 3 years ago, and here I am IVing heroin every single day. There were so many times thinking back when I could have made a different decision, or realized that I'm an addict at my core. It all makes sense now, and like they said hindsight is 20/20. I thought I was invincible, when actually I was insanely vulnerable to this all happening to me. My sister is doing the exact same thing as me and we both live at home with my parents. I never went back to school after that year and although I didn't fail out, I did absolutely horrible that last semester. I ended up with something like a 1.9 gpa. I have a decent job and can save some money out of every paycheck, but that's only because I have attempted to quit so many times (outpatient rehab, halfway houses, detoxes, NA meetings) that I have some self control now, but it's still a big problem that I have yet to completely get under control.",1435459746.0

Woke up and could hardly function.,"Okay, so before I tell my story I have to mention this weird thing I like to do. It's a pretty wasteful activity so I can only do it if I'm home alone. I'll run my shower but not get in it or anything. I stay totally clothed, I just sit down in the bathroom while the shower is running. I find it comforting. Don't judge. 

Anyways, story time. I copped some FIRE this afternoon. I actually posted a picture of it, these weird brown bags that I had never seen before. At first I was skeptical of them; just by looking at them you couldn't tell how much dope was in the bags, if any at all. My dboy assured me they weren't beat. In fact, I was told to be careful since it was so strong. I've heard that one before. Still, I decided to heed his warning and started off with just one bag. It was pretty good, and the bag had a decent amount in it too. I was happy with my purchase.

After my test bag, I had to swing by an old co-workers house to hook her up with a bag. She's lent me loads of money these past couple weeks, so I figured it was the least I could do. 

I left her place, and instead of going straight home I found a parking lot where I could knock down a few more bags. I think I bumped like three or four. Then I went straight home and posted up on my front porch and sparked up a cig. Even though I didn't even do half of my bundle, I was nodding fairly hard. Hell yea, I'm into it. 

Around the time I finished my cigarette, my old man came outside to tell me he was going to my cousin's daughter's bday party. Which means I've got the house to myself. ""Hell yea"" I think to myself. After he leaves I go into my room and rail four more bags and I'm feeling RIGHT. I'm sure that I'll be nodding hard, so I set an alarm for myself. While I'm high I decide that I'm going to do that thing I do with the running shower.

All I can say is that I'm glad I set an alarm. Because the moment I sat down with that shower going, I nodded off *RIGHT AWAY*. About a half hour later my alarm goes off and I snapped back. I had kind of expected to fade in and out, I wasn't anticipating just going out cold.

I was still high when I woke up, but I guess some combo of sitting in steam for a half hour and the shock of waking up like I did had me extra messed up. Because I was having trouble standing up straight and walking and all that good stuff. I ran downstairs to smoke a cigarette to center myself. After getting halfway thru I realized that my pops would be home soon, and my drug stuff was just sitting out. I was in such an absent-minded rush that I almost ran back inside with my smoke still lit. I was in a purely delirious state for a while before I could pull myself together. 

All I know is I'm so glad I set an alarm. I can't imagine if my dad had come home and I was passed out in the bathroom, with the shower running; clearly no intention of even taking a shower. Welp, lesson learned I suppose.

TL;DR I got super high, then ran my shower to create a sauna like effect. Nodded out and woke up to an alarm a half hour later. Had trouble functioning once I woke up.

anyways I don't know what the fuck this stuff is and I rip the bag open. freezeing helped it not be so gummy and I manage to scrape it out a little. I have some citric acid powder laying around that I never have to use (I get #4 powder dope here usually) and I mix it in just to be sure. pretty sure I didn't need it. anyways I shoot it and theres no killer rush or taste in my mouth really, compared to the shit I usually use which leaves a distinct taste. the high creeps up on me like FUCK, I just keep getting higher and higher. its like 1.5 hours since I fixed and im nodding out and I barely ever fucking nod!!! I can barely keep my eyes open right now. the shit just creeped up on me . 

its funny and fucked up cause I was originally angry at the guy cause I thought he burned me. this shit (looks like human shit, really) is awesome. is it fucking tar or what??? it doesn't look like any black tar heroin from pics online ive ever seen. ive nevr seen black tar around these parts but apparently it happens. like I said we get powder #4 usually. I think maybe this shit is Mexican??? I have no fucking clue but I like it. it honestly feels a little more fuller of a high than the shit I usually get. to me it feels like what I think opium latex would feel like. 

anyone have any ideas...? sorry didn't take pic before I shot it but it was literally brown like nesquik powder or something and I didn't smell it much but it tasted bitter like heroin does. I didn't notice any super vinegary smell but then again my sense of smell is kind of knackered when ive been using. so yeah, brown, sticky and melts in the heat, cooks up pretty much easily and leaves the water a light brown / dark tan.

I'm prescribed Oxys and am scared.,"So a lot of stories from people who are addicted to opiates end up with a ruined life. I'm just wondering in what ways opiates ruin a life. Is it the case that no matter what, if you take opiates for a long enough time you'll end up ruining your life, and in what way?

I am prescribed oxycontin and liquid oxycodone for a pain condition - my veins are very damaged on one side of my body and basically the blood going through them causes agony. I've been on these meds for over 2 years. If I've forgotten to take them or left them behind or something I get terrible withdrawals that I just can't handle. Even when I have better pain days I have to take the damn meds cos if I don't the withdrawals will get me. So now I never go a day without.

I never got high from them, they just make me feel really sleepy, which I don't enjoy. They seem to take away my energy, although maybe that's just depression caused by my condition. But I have had to up the dose over the years as my tolerance increased and they stopped managing the pain.

I guess I am scared that they are going to ruin my life. I want to stop taking them but I am really scared of the pain, but even more scared of the withdrawals. Does that mean I'm addicted? Will these ruin my life? Will it be that they mess up my body and mind, or is there some other way they mess everything up?

I live in the UK so I only have to pay the equivalent of about $12 a month for all my prescriptions (oxycontin, oxycodone liquid, blood thinners, anti depressants etc), so I don't think I will be financially ruined. I have been feeling more and more depressed and like not doing anything - is that a side effect of these drugs? If so, what can I do to stop the depression and the lethargy/fatigue?

If anyone has any help or answers I would be oh so very grateful. Thank you!

I know I can disclose to the lab that I'm prescribed it, but, I'm doing this test for school to get in a program.

I did a CWE on a pack of co-codamol, 32 8/500 tablets. I drank half and then half a while later and felt nothing. Disappointed, I grabbed another pack of 32 and started the process again, this time, though, I drank the whole thing.

This time it worked. I had about 1 minute of the buzz and shit started to go wrong. I got the worst itch all over my body. So incredibly itchy. I have had this happen before so I went to the kitchen and popped 2 cetirizine (Anti-Histamine) in the hopes that it would kick in and I could continue with the good effects.

It got worse. My skin started to go red all over my body. My eyes became bloodshot and glazed as fuck. My heart was beating through my chest and was beating at around 180bpm. The itch turned into pain. It was at this point I went and had a cold shower to try and ease the feeling on my skin. I was light headed. I felt like I could faint at any moment and I had to try and hide it. It was awful. 

I got out of the shower and got another anti histamine, but this time chewed it up, hoping that it would act faster that way. I popped an atenolol (beta blocker) to see if it would ease my heart. My knees BURNED. They felt hot to the touch as did the rest of my body.

It's been around an hour and a half since my last cold shower (I had 4). I feel normal again apart from a really shitty heartburn.
So be careful guys, that fucking SUCKED. Everything I have read since seems to say that my heartrate should have been either  faster or slower, but all seem to agree that it would be weak, which it definitely wasn't in my case.",1435617572.0

The answer is yes, and I am proof.","Tired of the weak-minded saying ""moderation doesn't exist with opiates or other hard drugs"". That statement is true, though only for those who say it. In reality, it's actually possible to do indulge in moderation. ""But what about addiction"" I can hear you say, well of course that possibility is... well, a possibility. But what about the other way around? Why can't you become addicted to using in moderation? Develop a code, a system for yourself, and it will become who you are.

Use everyday, you make that your code, your system, you will be an addict in no time. Use is moderation, you make that your code, your system, you will live the best of both worlds, a junkie and a respected member of society. It's what you decide to do with yourself. But once a code is followed long enough, it becomes who you are. You can become addicted, or you can become someone who uses in moderation

So we're all on the same page, this is the definition of moderation:

mod·er·ate:
1.  Being within reasonable limits; not excessive or extreme

I've been using opiates for over 5 years. In the beginning, I didn't have the sort of thinking that I have now and what I'm sharing with you, I fell victim to addiction very early on. I was like you saying ""moderation can't exist with this, the high is just too good"" after 2 years of everyday use, I finally got help. Shipped out to a 90 day inpatient rehab where I learned more about myself than I have in my whole life combined.

I didn't want help quitting opiates my whole life, I wanted help understanding addiction and my specific underlining issues that got me to the point where I must be fucked up every hour of every day. I learned a lot while in rehab, but I knew that it wasn't the end of my indulging, I knew that I wouldn't be clean for life, I knew there would be a day after my 90 day rehab hiatus that opiates and I would be reunited. I lost nearly everything as an addict, I wouldn't let that happen again.

It's been roughly 3 years since I was released from rehab, I follow a code now that inhibits me from falling back into full blown addiction, it's called moderation. I am NO stranger to the wonderful feeling of getting high on opiates, and I am definitely no stranger to the consequences and backlash one is dealt in active addiction. Moderation is like having the best of both worlds, I can live a perfectly normal life now AND still get high.

I do it like this:

On the 1st of every month, I will buy ONE OP80 (oxycodone), that is all I allow myself to have and buy. From there, I am free to do whatever with it, I could take the whole thing, split it into 4 or 8 pieces and take a piece every day until it's gone. It doesn't matter what I decide to do with it, once it's gone, it's gone, until the next 1st of the month. I usually just split it into 3, equals about 26.5mg each piece, and I'll take a piece of the 1st, the 2nd and the 3rd, so yes I'll be high for 3 straight days.. Well, 26mg doesn't really get you THAT high, a nice little comfortable buzz is more accurate... 

""BUT YOU'RE USING 3 DAYS IN A ROW!!! THAT'S NOT MODERATION"" it's my code and therefore I make the rules. Compared to 4-5 years ago when I was at my worst, using 200mg+ A DAY, i'd say that this is a huge difference for the best.

The best part about moderation is, you don't get labeled as a junkie anymore, hell, my entire family STILL thinks I'm clean, so do all my friends. I live the best of both worlds now, and you can too.

3bjpgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3bjpgo/first_time_really_doing_any_opiate_i_chose_to_iv/,32,https://redd.it/3bjpgo,firsttimebanger,"First time really doing any opiate, I chose to IV heroin...","So, yeah I'm pretty dumb, but I thought I'd write about my experience.

So for some reason I got this weird obsession with wanting to try IV heroin about a week ago. It happened while I was browsing some homemade porn on a tube site... I happened across a video of two girls, about 18, shooting each other up. Being a real creepy piece of human garbage, I couldn't get the picture out of my head. I've taken painkillers before and liked the way they made me feel, so this should be the same, just more intense, right? I resolved to score my first hit, and go for the gusto.

I watched instructional harm reduction videos about how to appropriately prepare a shot. I obtained rigs, sterile water, citric, sterile cottons.... I wanted to be prepared. I had all this nice gear, but no junk. How does one cold cop? I had to do some more research...

After intensely searching.... EDITED OUT THE VAGUEST MEETUP STORY OF HOW I SCORED...

OK. The good part.

I set up in front of my computer, so I had my tutorial if need be. I prepared 1.5 cc of water and some citric in my syringe. I broke off the tiniest bit from the corner of the tar, say, about a 5th of a tic-tac, just because I was afraid of any kind of OD. I cooked up, the water was really light because of how light the shot was, and I pulled it up through my cotton. It made my whole den smell like vinegar... It was a very distinctive smell. 

I'm a righty, so I went with the left antecubital space. My vein wasn't hard to find, and I took a deep breath, registered, aspirated, and pushed the plunger slowly... I immediately felt slightly warm... And soft. Nothing too big, because the shot was so small, but I got a real great sense of accomplishment. I had set out to do this thing out of sheer curiosity, and there I was. The sweating! I was sweating really really hard. But I just kinda sat back in my chair, and watched TV. Like I said, it was a light dose so I was pretty alert. Just a little warm.

The 2nd dose came about 6 hours later when I was feeling adventurous. This time, I more than doubled the amount of tar. The solution was a darker amber color and I could realllly smell it this time, especially since it seemed to be coming out of my pores. My elbow space had bruised up pretty well, so my genius led me to try injecting through the back of my hand. This time, it was hard to get the needle to aspirate, and it took some digging. I eventually got some blood back in the syringe, and I started to push the plunger. But about halfway through the shot, things didn't feel right. My hand got red, and I knew that I had blown out... Missed the shot. Panicked, I shoved the rest in, and waited. This time it felt more intense, but not as intense as I was thinking it would be... I cleaned up my gear, grabbed a soda, and sat back and enjoyed the little high.... BUT

Flash forward about 3 hours later, and I find myself legit HARD nodding while texting a friend... I kept going, ""this is weird, I've never fallen asleep sitting up like this before. I must be getting sleepy, I should lay down."" So, I go to bed, and about every 4 minutes I wake up gasping for breath. This is where my rational brain kicks back in and tells me I'm having respiratory depression. But, alas, being high as fuck, I really don't move. The gasping cycle continues for an hour or so.

In the middle of the night, I wake up coughing stomach acid out of my mouth. Great, in addition to the CNS depression, I'm also potentially going to aspirate. This time I get up, get some tums, and go back to sleep. No more gasping. No more acid.

So thats about it. It's enough to put me off of ever trying it again, because in hindsight, if I had hit that vein in my hand legit and not skinpopped it, I probably wouldn't be typing this right now. 

The good felt really good, the bad was pretty miserable. The hard nodding was an annoyance. I just think I did too much on my 2nd go-round. 

Welll, maybe I might try again. I'd like to get powder instead of tar and fuck with snorting it.

You share the bay with sea turtles and can hear whales singing to each other when you dive into the reef.  We paddle out on rented surfboards.    

I slide onto the wave face as it opens up and keep going down, down, down.  The wave face is smooth and full of yellow tang fish as the wall rises above me.  Then Kym drops in and cuts me off.  Leaning forward, her body crouched in a mystical kung fu fighting stance for balance, she HOWLS as she carves around me.  

I stretch my body, hold my arms forward to gain gravitational momentum towards the lip of the wave.  Kym starts pumping her board for speed.  At the last moment she stands up straight and explodes off the lip into the air.  I see her rocket into the blue poised and perfect.  Then the wave collapses over me as Kym laughing falls from the sky.  We tumble together into the bright blue Maui reef of Kaanapali.  
When I surface I grab the back of her hair and draw her close for a kiss.  She is talking but all I hear is that that weird hiss and beep, hiss and beep sound.

And I wake up.

I see my brother Carl.  He is talking.  I can't hear him but I know from his eyes he is giving me shit.  I try to tell him to fuck off but something is jammed in my mouth.  Mom's head slides over my view.  She looks sad, frail and old.  Much older than before.  

""Shhh!"", she shushes me.

I feel as though I have been far away.  I am in no hurry to come back.  My hand is on some sort of a trigger I keep pushing.  It goes click, click, click.  Nurses come in and look at me.  I keep pushing the button.  Click, click, CLICK.  And I feel it.  A kindness through my bones.  Peace.  A gentle breeze for the burning mind.  

The first high of the day is always the best I try to tell them, but no words come out.  

""How about this one?"" says Kym as she wiggles around in a green bikini checking herself out from all angles in the condo bedroom's mirror.  

She is modeling tiny bikinis for my viewing pleasure.  Bikinis for hiking, bikinis for sun bathing, bikinis for surfing, bikinis that you can't get wet...I have no idea what the criteria is but some are borderline obscene.  Like I would feel jealous with that much Kym on public display but she shrugs away my concerns.  

""It's Maui.  All the girls dress like this.""

""Really?"" I say.  Hmmm.  

Reading my thoughts she puts her arms around my neck and leans in close.  ""Oh there is a lot to see here babe.  Look all you want but remember...You belong to ME.""

When your topless girlfriend makes a bold declaration of love with just a hint of violence there is only one thing to do.  And we do it.  Twice.

That evening after eating grilled ono fish sandwiches, we drink beer and watch the sun set.  Far out over the sea the tip of a volcanic crater sticks out of the ocean with an island looming behind it.  Kym holds my hand and I watch the setting sun shine orange, violet and purple hues into the reflection of her sunglasses.

I lean back with a sigh.  So content is this paradise.  I look behind me and realize I am in a car.  I look up and see the darkest night out the passenger window.

""Fucking pigs everywhere!"", says Jason peering over his shoulder.  

He drives us out of the coastal town of Santa Cruz, California.  Highway 17 is a twisty, turning puke inducing beast of a road.  Kym groans in the back.  She got hammered at the MIRV show.  I found out oxycodone mixed with...well everything lays waste to your ass.  Jason was on acid and cocaine and nominated himself most sober.  We agreed as I held Kym's hair out of her face while she retched up $5 Hurricanes in the parking lot.    

One moment life is like this:  A winding road.  It leads us through dark valleys, oak trees and sparsely illuminated dots of human habitation.  

""This is like being in a hurry for enlightenment all while feeling incredibly vapid"", muses Jason.  He turns his head to look at me.  ""Hey.  You ok dude?""    

The next moment: BOOOM!  Tilting, whirling sideways world. CRUUUUNCHH!  Blackness.

Everything is so far away in the dark.  But I can hear them talking.  I can smell Kym's hair sometimes.

""You ok babe?"" asks Kym looking down at me.  

And I laugh.  For I solved the question I carried around in the dark.  Kym.  And here she is.  Missing her front tooth and wearing an eye patch.  

""Yeah real fucking funny"", says Carl looking over me.  ""Jesus!  Lay off the button.""

And they fill me in as I click, click, click my button.  Jason drove off the side of the road and plowed into the back of a stopped semi truck.  Car is totaled.  An air bag and a seat belt saved him.  But after they treated him he was taken to jail because of previous warrants.  Kym also wore a seat belt.  She slammed into the driver's seat.  Lost a tooth, got a huge black eye but nothing broken.  

""They gave me percocet.  I'll give you some babe!"" winks Kym.

""No!  No you won't!"", says Carl.  Asshole.

""Shit, I should jack that thing into my arm..."", says Kym watching my IV.

""No.  They should throw your ass out the hospital is what they should do"" responds Carl.

I listen to them bicker as pain comes.  Little waves shocking my system.  Body pain.  Spinal agony.  And my fucking leg...I don't know if I hurt because I am injured or is this withdrawal?  Kym touches my cheek and gives me a kiss.  It is a deep kiss.  Hardly the sort of kiss you would think is appropriate with your mom and brother in the room.  Then her tongue pushes in two percocets.  I look up in surprise as she winks.  Then she sits up, brushes my hair out of my face and tells me another piece of the puzzle.  

Click, click, click.  

I was not wearing a seat belt.  Somehow I bounced off the windshield or maybe the dashboard and shot threw the passenger window.  Unfortunately, it was closed.  I have quite a few cuts.  Emergency response found me sitting next to Kym.  I had put my jacket over her and was holding her hand.  They said I asked for a tissue and then walked around shaking everyone's hands.  When they pointed out my leg seemed injured I looked down.  My knee was bent sideways.  I passed out.  

Click, click, CLICK!

Whoosh.  It approaches slowly like a sheet of rain moving steadily over green hills...I watch liquid drip, drip, drip into me.  Oh yes.  Please.  More.

""Hey before you go"", asks Kym conversationally as she gets out a pad of paper and pulls a pencil out from behind her ear, ""what's Jason's dad's name?""

""James Rusca.""

""Where does he live?""

""Los Altos.""

""What's his mom's name?""

""CiiinOhmmmFuuuuuccc....""

We spent most of the day on the beach.  We hiked to an old concrete World War 2 pillbox.  It was built into the sand dunes above the beautiful blue bay.  Sitting in the bunker, we eat sushi and papaya for lunch.  Trade winds soothe our sun kissed bodies as we laze in the shade sharing a cigarette.  The euphoria I feel matches the beauty dazzling my eyes.  I can see other islands across the sea.  Jungle green mountains rise from an azure sea to kiss the clear blue sky.

""Kym...""

""Yeah babe?""

""This is where the color of your eyes comes from.""

She laughs and kisses my neck as I watch a pod of spinner dolphins dance across the bay.  Palm fronds rustle above us.  I kiss Kym's smiles again and again.  I get pulled into her spell.  She is perfect.  This moment is perfect.  There will never be another moment like this for me.  But in an infinite Universe there must be another dimension where this moment lasts forever.  I want this dimension hidden in a glass bauble and secreted away in my brain.  A shelter for all the storms and pain I sense coming my way.

Kym sits up to sip her soda.  I dig my toes into the fine white sand as she holds me and looks into my eyes.

""Do you like it here?"" she asks softly.

""I do but...""  I look into her face.  ""This is another world, right?  We are on the other side.""

""Yes.  You can tell?"" she asks calmly as her wide blue eyes study my face.

""Yeah.  But I don't care.  Kym?""

""Hmm?"" she says lazily as she runs her lips across my neck towards my ear.

""Do you want to get married?""

Kym stops nuzzling me and pulls away.  ""What?  You serious?""

""Yes"", I say looking at our feet in the sand.  ""Let's leave our roots here.  Here in this world.  You and me.  Where everything is perfect.""

She touches my cheek and smiles.  ""I am you.  You are me.  Love me...""  

I drift off to sleep and feel her next to me.  Everything vanishes but our hearts that beat for pleasures found only in this hidden garden.  In the Darkness I can hear music.

""...to be somebody's baby...""

I walk slowly.  I don't want to leave...I look around.  The beach is gone.  I look back into the darkness.  The sound shows me the way out.    

""...she's so fine...""

I trudge up the hill reluctantly.  Fuck.  I lost it all.

I wake up and Kym is sitting on my bed leaning against me watching Fast Times At Ridgemont High.  My roommate is an Asian man who stares uncomprehendingly at the TV.  His sparkly expression tells me he is on the good stuff too.

""Mmmm babe"", whispers Kym in my ear as she yawns and then kisses me.  Her eye patch is gone.  The bruise over her face is an ugly purple color that surrounds her watery, bloodshot eye.  She smiles and I see her tooth is still missing.

""What happened?""  I croak.  

I feel dry and withered.  Corpse-like.  And sick.  Dopesick.  

""Well Jason's in Santa Cruz County Jail.  Maybe out by now.  I got a hold of his dad.  Luckily Melo knew his mom and I got his business card from her.  You know how Jase always gives me shit?  Poor little rich girl and all that crap?  His dad is posted his bail and says he'll cover Iona's car with his insurance.""

""Hmm"" I respond so she knows I am listening.  But I am not.  Fucking thing!  Work damn you.  

Click, click, click.  

""You did all that from here?"" I ask while experimenting with new ways to push the button.  Fast, slow. hard pushes, light ones.

""Yup.  One calling card from Santino's, one hospital payphone and perseverance.  I couldn't let the little butthole sit in jail.  He's too pretty to make it on the inside.  His dad says he's going to rehab though.""

Click, click, click.  

""Kym?""

""Yeah?""

""Did we go to Maui?""  

Click, click, CLICK.  And I feel it washing over my bones...

""Maui?  Well yeah.  We stayed at my parent's condo in Wailea, remember?  Why?""

I watch her grow distant through the haze.  So beautiful.  I feel complete happiness.  I feel the cosmic peace.  I can see the glass bauble in her look.  The blue sea, the white sand.

""Kym""  I croak, ""...we married?""

""What?!  Really?!  Man, I want some of that drip you're on...""

And the Darkness comes.  I hear her laughter from far away.  I try to get back but it washes over me.

I've been taking suboxone for about a year now and have gone from about .75 mg to about 2-4 mg a day now so I won't crave Roxies (or any other opiate). I want to quit taking it more than anything but don't have the time or money to go to a medical detox or detox on my own. The reason being is that I am a full time college student and I also work about 20-30 hours a week. I'm about to graduate college and would really like to be completely off subs before I start job hunting. I'm planning on taking about a month off of work to go stay with a friend (who has been sober for over a year and went through the same issues) and detox myself while I am there. My question is if that is enough time to get better on my own or if it will take longer than a month.
