I think my brain is fucked up pls help,"Hey everyone I have a few questions about some shit that I need help with. Sorry in advance for the wall of text.

I've been addicted to opiates for about three or four years now. I was on subs for about a year and then I had a big relapse last year. My habit wasn't as big as some, but I was doing 5-6 oxy 30s a day. I've switched from oxy to subs way too many times within the past year and I just had 3 months clean from everything but subs. With that being said, this weekend I decided to have a little fun.


Within the last month or so I've been experiencing some issues where the subs have been giving me anxiety. I've been snorting them because I have an intranasal fetish (I realize that I need to stop doing it because it's just a waste), and I don't think I'm even taking 1mg a day (I've been trying to ween myself down). The lines I'm doing are extremely small, but sometimes I do get ""high"" from it. I dose the same size line about 3 times a day, which is MAYBE .25mg per dose. It may be a tad more/less. If I don't take enough, or if I wait too long to take the dose then I start feeling kinda weird and shitty. I know most of you have experienced the pre-withdrawal fogginess, and the restless feeling in the pit of your stomach. I thought subs had a pretty long half life so should I even be going into withdrawal so soon? There have been times where I've woken up in the middle of the night with restless legs.

Anyway, I did two of those lines on Friday: the first was around 9am and then again at like...11:30-11:45am. I had to dose a second time because the first line didn't really do anything. Later that evening I bought three oxy 30s around 7:30pm, dosed 7.5mg (just to be safe, lots of fakes going around) and I felt it. It wasn't strong or anything, but I was feeling kinda nice, and then I took another 7.5mg a little while later. I've dosed like this pretty much all weekend and I've felt it every single time, and now I only have one left which I'm saving for tomorrow.

I'm not gonna lie and say that this weekend hasn't been nice, because it has. Subs have been doing some weird shit to me lately (lots of anxiety and lots of brain fog/depersonalization) so getting some relief and getting high has been wonderful. I promised my fiancee that this is a one-off and that I'm getting back on subs once the last one is gone. 

As for questions, has anyone else experienced this with subs? Why is my tolerance so fucking low? Is it because I've been snorting them? Is my induction period gonna be bad or will the withdrawal be pretty mild since I wasn't using too much? Should I not take the subs and see how it goes for a couple of days?

I know this post is kinda all over the place, but I just want some advice. Tell me whatever you wanna tell me or whatever you think. Everything sucks right now and I don't wanna do this shit anymore. ",1535336355.0

I'm currently on Suboxone after having been addicted to Fentanyl for just over a year. I'm happy to say I'm 6 months and 1 week clean. I started at a very high dose of Suboxone and have now managed to taper down to 0.2-0.4mg per day. However I have a surgery coming up in a couple of weeks where they will be putting me under with anaesthetic. Would the Suboxone in my system affect the anaesthetic? I really don't want to wake up halfway thru surgery or something like that but I'm also cautious about mentioning my Suboxone use to the anaesthetist as it's not prescribed to me and also he may put me on some sort of nation-wide drug addict registrar which would be far from ideal considering how far I've come since my Fentanyl using days.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/92k18g/why_opanas_is_dangerous/
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 There was a lot of back and forth on people saying my math was wrong, users who stated that there was no way oral Opanas were stronger than Percocets oral, personal experience not adding up to my conclusions, etc. I am back now, after doing some more research, to give a more in depth walk through of what the actual truth on the potency is. To start, I will give a recap on what information I was referring to, and the point I was trying to get across:

First, the base comparison we start with is the ratio of potency when comparing Oxycodone to Oxymorphone, which many people throw around is a 2:1 ratio. 2mg of Oxycodone equals 1mg of Opana. This fact is true. HOWEVER, people forget to add the next bit of CRUCIAL information with that ratio, which is that this 2:1 value is when comparing ORAL administration. This value is only true when you are trying to calculate oral doses. Next we will look into the bio-availability of different ROA(routes of administration):

Oral Absorption: Pharmaceutical Ratio: [2mg Oxycodone = 1mg Oxymorphone]
Oxycodone= ~87% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~12% efficiency
This means that Opanas are DOUBLE the strength of Percocets, with only 1/10th of the total administered dose even being metabolized. Oxycodone, with almost 90% of the total dose being absorbed, is still only HALF of the potency of Oxymorphone.
---------------------------------------

Intranasal Absorption(snorting):
Oxycodone= ~47% efficiency
Oxymorphone= ~42% efficiency
(This is where I start to lay out my point. Also, keep in mind I am getting these values from simply looking up the bioavaliability of these opiates with different ROA's online on health websites and medical journals. Anyone can find any of the values I start with by taking a couple minutes to Google search.)
---------------------------------------
As shown, Oxymorphone has now jumped in it's total absorption from ~12% orally, to 42% when snorted. This is a 350% increase in potency. Let us use an example just to see how crazy this value is. I will start with us scoring a 10mg K71 Pill(Instant-Release Oxymorphone). This is one of the very few Oxymorphone pills that can be crushed effectively. To compare:
-If swallowed, only 1.2mg of 10mg will be active in the body. However, that 10mg Opana will be as strong as swallowing 20mg of Percocet. At 87% oral absorption, 17.4mg of Oxycodone will be active in the body. Using the 2:1 strength ratio, 10mg Opana = 20mg Percocet. after calculating the absorbed weight, we see that 1.2mg of metabolized Opana EQUALS 17.4mg of metabolized Percocet. That is a 14:1 active chemical ratio(14mg absorbed Percocet=1mg absorbed Opana).

Now we can move onto snorting. Let us take that same 10mg Opana IR pill again. Instead of swallowing the pill with only a 12% efficiency rate, we will snort it to get 42% efficiency. Snorting the Opana gives us 4.2mg that is metabolized. Let me explain that to you again; 42% absorption VS 12% absorption! 4.2mg / 1.2mg = 3.5X increase in potency from the SAME DOSE just by snorting the bastard. So what does this mean? Well, Snorting all of that 10mg IR Opana would be the same as ORALLY TAKING 35mg of Opana. Now, remember that 2:1 ratio? That is the absolute ratio for oral Oxycodone vs oral Oxymorphone. I will input that into the string of steps in our calculation. Now:

10mg Opana(Intranasal) X 3.5(value snorted vs oral) = 35mg Opana(Oral)

35mg Opana(Oral) X 2(oral value Opana vs Percocet) = 70mg Oxycodone(Oral)

Now, let us compare snorting Oxycodone instead of orally taking it. The Absorption rate of Oxycodone goes down from 87% absorption orally, to 47% intranasally. This is a 46% reduction in potency(That sucks. Kids, always eat your Percocets!) We now continue our math:

70mg Oxycodone(Oral) X 0.46(Reduced efficiency value) = 32.2mg(amount that is lost from non-absorption) - 70mg(Oral Oxycodone initial weight) = -37.8mg Oxycodone(Insufflated)

Ignore the negative sign; 70mg of Oral Oxycodone becomes only a 37.8mg dose when snorted. Divide both values, and we find that:

 1.85mg Snorted Oxycodone = 1mg Oral Oxycodone, OR 1.85mg(Snorted):1mg(Oral)

Finally, in order to get the same potency of 70mg of oral Oxycodone, one must snort about 130mg of Percocet up the nose!

10mg Opana(Snorted) will now be equivelent to: =====

35mg Opana(Oral)
70mg Percocet(Oral)
and 130mg Percocet(Snorted)

There you go. I hope this has became clear to understand how powerful Oxymorphone becomes when one decides to snort the contents. It is easy to see how people are overdosing on Opanas with little tolerance.

As always, feedback is much appreciated! Stay safe out there :)

The problem is I need to test positive for opiates to get the script, it's the law. Now, I've sent myself to my mothers in the countryside to keep me from scoring and shooing up, so I have no way to get dope. My strategy has been to buy some co-codamol from the pharmacy. They are 32 tablets, 8mg codeine /  400mg paracetamol. I bought 2 boxes. Earlier I did a cold water extraction with one box, drank the codeine (which was FUCKING AMAZING btw). I've been popping pills from the other box regularly. 

My hope is that this will make me test positive, without actually doing dope, in the assumption that it will metabolise into morphine in my body and come out as such on the test. 

Am I on the right lines here? Will this work?

hydrocodone- seems to be the basic bitch of opioids. Nothing really amazing when it comes to euphoria and just doesn't hit the spot that well. I give it a 7/10 because any opioid is good to some extent  

tramadol - was fun, I enjoyed the duration and energy of it but did not like the nausea. 7.1/10  

hydromorphone - I boofed it, it was nice but went away fast. I also didn't really know my tolerance so I played it safe and didn't get that rush people love it for. It was very short though and I didn't think it was worth the cost (pills ain't cheap man) 7.5/10

tapentadol - alright euphoria and decent duration and not too sedating. I found it quite nice. I also like the kinda dissociating feelings it can bring with light visuals, definetely a more unique feeling opioid. 7.5/10  

Fentanyl - forgot to mention this one earlier, I got it before surgery at the hospital and since I was able to get pretty high I'm counting it. It made me feel quite warm and nice, I was buzzing from it for a good couple hours. I still didn't have that awesomeness of some other opioids I've done. 7.8/10  

Codeine - I really like codeine, probably cause I'm a noob but it gave me a level of relaxation that I've not experienced on other opioids. It was very laid back and just nice, although its a bit lacking after the come up. It's also the only opioid that made me itch a slow moving red rash that started at the top of my head and slowly moved down my body til I took a benadryl. I looked like I was tweaking with how much I was scratching myself.

Opium - I liked this one quite a bit. There's nothing like smoking some opium off foil with the gang. I enjoyed it smoking, it gave me a weird very dreamlike state and I felt very relaxed and comfy. It wasn't too sedating either. I liked it even better when eating it, although smoking a couple cigs on it with some kratom made me throw it. Gave me the warm and fuzzies before that though. Solid 8/10.  

Methadone - I really liked methadone. It was nothing crazy with euphoria but was still one of the better ones I felt. It was a little sedating. What I really liked was the long duration. I was high all fucking day and when I throw kratom on top my face started flushing (I fucking love the flushing) like when I first started drinking that green shit. 8.5/10  

Oxycodone - Now oxycodone really hits the spot. It just hits you right in the right spot of your receptors if ya feel me. I only did it a couple time but I found it to be very enjoyable. That's all I have to say, sorry I'm not very good at this and am just stimmed out and thought rating all the opioids I did would be fun cause fuck it why not amirite y'all. 9/10 cause you deserve it oxy  

Heroin - I smoked it. Made me feel really gooey, one of the most magical feeling opioids and had an afterglow that lasted all day keeping me in a good mood. I see why this is alot of people's favorite. 10/10  

Oxymorphone - Oh my god... I never felt like I did when I did opana before. That was the euphoria that people chase for the rest of their opioid careers and holy shit it was so good. Just a freight train of pure euphoria ran me over. I also had to make sure I was breathing enough and was ready to have my buddy drive to the walgreens to get some nalaxone because I kept getting higher and higher for like 90 minutes. I took 35mg ER split into pieces and didn't know how much the time release would affect how it hit me and what would be safe even though I knew the conversion of potency from oxycodone to oxymorph. BTW sorry guys, don't hate me for eating it, I was just too lazy to put in the work to break the abuse protection, plus god knows I didn't need that much opana after how awesome it was. It was the first opioid to give me legit craving for a few days after one use. It was just perfect, I can only imagine slamming it (don't wanna know until I'm on my deathbed, I don't trust myself enough with that). 11/10   

Anyways my little adventure is over. I am still content with just having kratom in my life cuz I would like to avoid those withdrawals and the complete grip opioids can have on your life. I shall not order any more internet opioids because they are just too easy to get. Anyways I hope somebody enjoyed this, I spent way too long on it lol

I will preface this by saying I probably started like everyone else. I had surgery a while ago and got prescribed some pain meds. Prior to that I didn’t have a lot of experience with it, but turns out I enjoyed it. Shocker right ?  Fast forward 6 months and I occasionally like them recreationally. And I mean very occasionally. I take no more than 2 at a time of like 5s or 7.5s whatever I can get my hands on. I got some 7.5s from a friends plug the other day and now I’m nervous about all the presses stuff. He says I’m good and not to be worried and they look totally fine to me. I even zoomed in really far on an image to check the font and it looks good. All the pills are uniform and don’t “look” pressed. Wouldn’t be a total waste of time and money to press something like this ? I’d think most people wouldn’t even want to buy a dosage this low. I only eat them I’ve never snorted or anything and that’s how I would use these. What are your thoughts and how could I be safe if I’m really scared about it? Eat a half one and wait what period of time before eating another half ? Thanks ",1535314799.0

But after a week I was like fuck it, the worst of its over let’s give sobriety a good shot. 

Anyway, feel bad about myself. But at the same time sense I quit I have been panicking constantly, my mental health has gotten worse, and I just couldn’t deal with the world, it’s to overwhelming sometimes.

All I need is a benzo script, as I don’t like taking benzos wirhout  a script cause the WDs are horrible and they’re to easy to abuse for me but instead I get put on seroquill and all these horrible chemicals for an anxiety disorder. If you’re not going to help me doc, I’m going to help myself. 

I guess at some point you gotta deal with that shit though, it’s a scary thing when you need to have chemicals in your body to feel like a normal human being.

Today I came clean to my mom who told me last month that if I used again I would be put out on the street. For the past month I have used in secret, sold literally everything I have except for a couple changes of clothes and my bed at her house, I have stolen from her, pawned my engagement ring, and all the other jewelry I have. I have realized anyone “in the game” I thought was my friend was not and have been used by every single one of them. The best past week I have wanted to kill myself every time I wasn’t high (which was getting harder and harder to do) so I decided yesterday was my last day. Today has been complete hell except for the fact that I had a 10th or a suboxone left. I’m in pain, eyes watering, nose running, extremely tired, depressed, anxious, goosebumps, sweats, and stomach cramps. But I am making this the last time I go through this shit. I cannot go on living everyday either suicidal or selling stolen stuff for the high. 

I have previously had alcohol and benzo addiction and went to treatment for a month and came home and stayed clean for 1.5 years. I was able to finish my Masters and get a good job and live on my own. I would go to 12 step meetings a few times a week and had a sponsor I worked the 12 steps with. 

Then I was introduced to heroin. The first time I tried it my boyfriend at the time shot me up. That was in October. I have been using on and off since then. It usually takes about .3 to get me high. So since October I have been to treatment 2 times, sober living once, tried opioid maintenance therapy with suboxone, and 12 steps. I could not stay clean. The longest run I’ve had was 85 days. I have lost 3 apartments, 1 job, a brand new car, all my furniture, all my electronics, all my jewelry, most of my clothes, and a lot of friends. I have nothing left to give heroin. 

If anyone out there is willing to help me get through this it would be much appreciated. I just need someone to talk to (and I do see a therapist weekly but she really doesn’t understand 1st hand what this is like). Any books, tv shows, movies, etc that can help me through this process would be much appreciated. Everyone I know is DONE with me (except my mom being willing to give me one last chance). I just need to know that it gets better and that it is possible. 

A little backstory: I am diagnosed with narcolepsy, depression, panic disorder, anxiety disorder, and ADD. The heroin really helped me self medicate the depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. The heroin also surprisingly helped a lot with my narcolepsy (which you can search online about the studies being done with opiates and narcolepsy to see that it isn’t total bullshit). 

Any help would be much appreciated! ",1535311426.0

Kratom to follow for 5 days.....here’s what happened.,"... I actually just caved and went back on subs which show how strong they are because 1 opm kratom gold capsule could get me through the day before I started long term suboxone use.  It’s like my opiate receptors are so deteriorated that the kratom has little to no effect on me as far as the withdrawal part goes.  I felt relief at some points in the day, I even played a tennis match early in the morning yesterday.  However, the withdrawals would still come and go despite feeling effects from the Kratom just lack of opiate like effects that could equal what lack of receptor attention my brain was getting from the suboxone use followed by HEAVY strong full agonist dope insufflation every 30 minutes to an hour for a week, that it wasn’t even getting me to the point of “normal” during those 5 days.  I had expectations that it would get better each day but the results I was getting were all over the place which ultimately led to getting back on suboxone today.... I know I relapsed on dope for week but I was on day 5 off dope and day 13 off sub or something and I couldn’t handle it!  I was taking 3 opm gold capsules and dosing with red devil kratom plain leaf a few times throughout the day when i started to feel like I needed something and I was so fucked at night and when I woke up I couldn’t handle it I’m talking SUPER RESTLESS .. skin crawling.  Getting that feeling where you just want to move your arms or legs and “shake it out” so to speak because you’re so antsy .... it literally felt like I was going cold turkey.  A lot of times I can tell how bad withdrawal is by jerking off as weird as it sounds.  I pulled up some porn and literally barely had to touch my shit to get a nut.  Scary stuff.   I’m hoping now that I’ve felt that way I can take 4 mg or less of suboxone ONCE per day in the morning (which I think is important not to redose during the day because it’s addict behavior) and we will go from there.  Im really down on myself though because I feel like I just wasted money and time and set myself back even more.   I could not keep the kratom going for the cost of the gold capsules (51 bucks for a fucking 5 pack) and the lack of results I was getting, it just wasn’t worth it.  Back to the drawing board folks.  That relapse on dope was so irrational of me and just stupid.  I picked up a 1/16 twice and was posting pictures of it which I deleted.  I was driving 3.5 hours ONE WAY to get it so basically spending a full day driving to get it.  I got to fuck with the cleanest purest dope I’ve done in a long time.  The Midwest is crazy good I guess because it’s one of the main hubs for the cartel.  I knew but I now EXPERIENCED IT and know that this dope (or any strong dope/opiate for that matter) would put me in a REALLY REALLY bad spot if I kept fucking with it.  It affects me so quickly like one week and I’m a totally different fuck up.  So I literally don’t know what my plan is,  that week I was on the dope I was sleeping so heavy I missed an important work meeting and my boss was in the meeting.  I didn’t wake up until 2 hours after the meeting.  Made up a dumb excuse and he caught me in the lie.  I’m a terrible liar.  That’s literally grounds for getting fired now he’s all over me got his hawk eye on me and The motivation is still lacking.  I have no idea what I’m going to do if I lose this job.  My living situation isn’t great and it’s just been really REALLY tough guys.  I feel like I’m trapped.   I am in a new city and a new job (well 5 months in ) and this isn’t a do your duty and go home type of job there’s a ton of moving parts and it’s basically up to you and your self motivation to get shit done.  On top of that, I’m struggling in my personal life, to make close friends (particularly guys as weird as that sounds). I play tennis and basketball and workout sometimes and it’s still haven’t yielded any friends.  I know this is mostly on me.  I’ve gone on some dates with women had some sex (despite my flaws I’d like to say I’m a decent looking guy and friendly,  pretty good with women and can easily look and seem like the most normal guy out there) .  It’s tough to hide all this bullshit.  Now I’m going on a tangent but like I live with 3 roommates and it’s like we don’t even know each other .. In the kitchen at the same time, few general words exchanged and that’s it.  It sucks.  I miss home.  I miss my close friends that I have more in common with.  They are like the closest thing I have to brothers.  I always kept a tight circle idk why this is so much harder than college was.  I guess even in college I always had atleast 3 people I knew very well for the most part.  Fuck folks I am a lost little fucker.  I was up at 6 am this morning with the thought that I was probably going to stop kratom bc of how bad I was feeling.  I walked to McDonald’s grabbed hot cakes and a coffee to try to take a shit.  Stuck one of those liquid glycerin things up my ass (this is a once per week thing I’m used to it now but it sucks !). Emptied probably half my bowels and put the sub in.  Btw the bowel thing is a separate problem but it really fucks with me hard on a daily basis.  My bowels are so fucked.  I can barely have bowel movements without some serious free time and efforts when I’m on anything including kratom.  In the past when I’ve had sober time like a few months or slightly more it seemed like my bowels were over active and it wasn’t going to change.  I would go to the bathroom like 4 times a day usually all in intervals of like 15-30 mins per movement.  Very piecy poop like felt like I was having a nutrient deficiency and it was just terrible.  I hated it but honestly I think I’d rather go than not go but I have some sort of poop anxiety thing where I’m constantly plagued and worried about pooping and how my movements are when I will go etc.  I’ve tried not thinking about it but then I just get backed up for however long I continue to have that mentality.  I have to wake up and perform this routine that takes most of the morning to get a movement before the sub goes in.  It’s not fun and it just reminds me everyday of my fucked up situation.

But then since Monday I've been having numbness in that left hand, on that side, it basically is numb from my wrist to the tip of my fingers, from my pinky to my ring finger, middle to thumb and down is not numb. So half of my hand, if that makes sense. 

I thought it was numbness from killing my left arm veins and loss of circulation or something until talking to my girlfriend who said prolonged numbness would only be cased by nerve damage, which reminded me I hit a nerve right where it's numb last Sunday.

Risk of taking?,"Okay so I’m in the hospital in a normal room. It’s my last night, getting checked out to go home tomorrow. 

Next to my hospital bed there’s a small dresser/nightstand with three drawers.  The bottom two are empty but the top drawer has 5-6 unopened sharps. 
No idea why they are there. 

In the top drawer there is an empty box of IV Labetalol HCI. I believe it was what they were injecting in my stomach to help prevent blood clots, as I also have those weird things on my calf’s/lower legs that inflate to increase blood flow to prevent blood clots.

In the same top drawer there are also 6 unopened sterile 
“Magellan 1/2mL Insulin Safety Syringes. “

Below that text, in italics, the wrapping says “Permanent Needle”

Below that if says:

“29 G x 1/2” (0.33 mm x 1.3 cm)

To the right of the top-ish text is also says in small font “For use with U-100 insulin only”


I have no easy way of getting of getting sharps in my state unless I go a state over to a pharmacy and they still give hassle, Iv never done it, just friends who needed sharps.

They haven’t moved. Since the day I got in the room, tomorrow will be my third day admitted, nothing in the drawer has moved. 
I’m in the hospital due to an asthma attack the weather triggered. I’m not prescribed any opioids and haven’t received any while here.

But, at home I do have some fire id love to bang. I usually have to use insufflation as my ROA due to my inability/laziness to get sharps. But it seems right now I have an opportunity to take one or two.

I’m just confused why they are even there, they are completely sterile and would obviously work for IV ROA of dope.
What kind of risk am I looking at putting 1-3 in my bag before checkout? There’s no cameras in this room and like I said they’ve just sat there since I got in this room.

TL;DR 
In hospital for few days due to weather related asthma. In the top drawer of my beside dresser there are unopened sterile insulin 29 G x 1/2” sharps. What is the ultimate risk in pocketing s couple of these before I get discharged tomorrow?

Saturday and Sunday. The hard days at work. A little reward for not doing any stupid shit throughout the week. Surprisingly enough I've been able to stick to those two days, haven't slipped up past that. And because I give myself a solid 5 days off in a row I never get even a hint of WD. 


Recently my guy stopped getting Zubsolvs and started getting methadone. He's been selling my the 40mg wafer. Last week I got 1, and took the whole thing. Didn't feel much. So this week I got 4, and today I took 1 3/4, for 70mg. I enjoyed that, and wasn't too crazy. But I don't have a lot of experience with methadone and have a few questions. 


So I know the half life is very long. Will my prior strategy of 2 days on, 5 days off work with methadone? Work to the point of not having any physical WD? That is how the bupe was for me, and if I start developing physical WDs after giving myself 5 days off I am going to have to stop taking it. I won't risk physical WDs/


Second question is about dosing. Like I said, today I took 70mg. I enjoyed that. My plan was to take the other two wafers I have tomorrow (80mg). However when reading up on methadone redosing I am reading a lot of people warning about redosing. That even 24 hours later there can still be so much in your body that you can OD. So is redosing a day later not a good idea?


tl;dr 

Question 1 - If I take methadone for 2 days and then give myself 5 
days off and do that every week is the 5 days off enough to ensure I never get physical WD.

Question 2 - Should I not redose the second day since it stays in my system for so long? Ideally I would take 80mg Saturday morning, and 80mg Sunday morning. However if that effectively means I am on 160mg on Sunday after taking that days dose it may not be the best idea.

Someone had finally paid her for a car she sold them and she hadn't made it to the bank in a week to deposit the money.

I know I'll get a fire ass check in two weeks but I gotta survive in the meantime right. So I'm like I need a loan. Lol I gotta pay my car payment, my girl is paying our insurance, and mom is paying the house bills and shit. She's like how much do you need? I'm like well 400 dollars will probably help me out cause my first pay check is gone to bills whenever that hits and I still gotta make it two weeks and gas and shit. So shes like I gotcha. And she counts me out 4 bills. So I got enough money to pay my car payment, got a gram, and got my gas and juice covered for the next two weeks. Talk about a blessing for real. I gotta make the G stretch out but wow. I was honestly shocked. She's like don't worry about paying me I know you're good for it, you're family ya know. I was amazed the whole way back.

9aarte,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9aarte/pandas/,9,https://redd.it/9aarte,pack3t,"""Pandas""","Sup everyone, long-time lurker, occasional poster on a throwaway account.  I had this account ""laying around"" in my password manager and decided this would be my /r/opiates account so I can post more often.  You all have a great, unique, *helpful*, and friendly community here.  

A ""quick"" history/introduction, skip to the **TLDR;** if you ain't got time for my bullshit.

I suffer from a chronic pain condition (don't want to go into details but I've already had both hips replaced at age 23, need knee and other joint replacements eventually).  I am a late 20s male.  Started on Norco 5mgs and over the years ""worked my way up"" to oxycodone IR 20mg 4x a day.  My doc is also a big proponent of medical cannabis.  Although my state has a medical cannabis program, I sadly do not meet the requirements for it.  Luckily, I have a wink-wink-nudge-nudge relationship on this matter with my doc and he has stated as long as I'm honest about it and it helps, he doesn't care about my cannabis usage.  I have multiple friends who *do* have their MMJ cards so I have them pick me up goodies (usually transdermal patches, gels, and some top quality buds).

Anyways, I noticed reading through some sub-reddits like this one and /r/ChronicPain that a lot of chronic pain patients are on an ER medication combined with an IR medication for break through pain.  I brought this up with my doc and he said that this is usually a better route for patients like me who need constant pain relief instead of riding the ""pain roller coaster"", trying to catch up with the pain using only the IRs.  After some thinking, he asked if I wanted to try out Opana 20mg 2x a day and cut the oxycodone back from 4x a day to 2x a day for break through pain.  I decided to go for it.  

Here's where it gets a little weird.

Things were fine for 2 months, except I was getting the Endo E20 Opanas.  I read all over that these were being pulled off the market.  This was worrisome to me because this new regimen worked very well, but I figured hey my doc and pharmacist (who I've gotten to know a little bit) know what they're doing! (d'oh).  Last fill date, I was able to fill the Opana, but the pharmacist warned me he can't order more of the Opana because it's discontinued.  He also said there's no generic.  

Now I know from my time lurking here that the prized ""pandas"" do indeed exist, and a little green G73 pill should be in my future.  Both my doc and the pharmacist insisted they don't know of a generic.  I guess it's possible; they can't remember *every detail* about *every drug*.  So this month my doc gave me oxymorphone IR 10mg 4x a day.  They are pink K71 and they kinda suck.  I don't seem to get nearly as much pain relief (even considering I currently don't have the oxycodone).

I called my doctor and told him that after ""some intense googling"" (lol) that ""I think I found a generic of the Opana that was working so well for me"".  He kinda sounded like he didn't believe me, but was also curious.  I told him the manufacturer and the color and imprint that I ""found on some website"".  He looked it up, called the local pharmacy (not the one I go to, but same chain) and he said they confirmed they have it.  My local pharmacy didn't have it in stock but said they could order it for me for next month if the doctor gives the OK (which he did).

**TLDR;** I was getting Endo E20s Opana even though they've been discontinued.  The pharmacy eventually ran out of stock and *then* told me they can't order anymore.  I'm now on oxymorphone IR 10mg 4x a day for the time being.  I informed my doctor that I found a generic (the G73s), he confirmed this, and my pharmacist confirmed he can order it for me.

So next month it looks like I am going back to oxymorphone 20mg ER 2x a day (but the G73s instead of the E20s) and oxycodone 20mg IR 2x a day as needed.  

1. Does anyone know if I can count on these to be available for the foreseeable future?  They're not pulling *all* oxymorphone ER off the market, right?  Since my doc and pharmacist were both pretty clueless about the Endo E20s being pulled, I'm a little concerned that I'll have this one pulled out from under me as well with little or no warning.  
2. Once in a while I'd take the 'ol dremel to the E20 and snort it (yeeeee-hawwww).  Are the G73s easier, harder, or about the same to break down for snorting?",1535236288.0

I would like to ask you something: do many of you use opiates and the pleasures that they deliver as a replacement for sexual activity, or as a substitute that made up for (or more than made up for!) a non-existent or pitiful sex life and all the anxiety that that brings?  
Personally, I would go as far to say that opiated pleasures are erotic...it's generally accepted that they are sensual, but erotic? For me, definitely that too...especially at the beginning before the magic starts to go and you're saying, ""uh oh"" but that's a different story. I like the sound of 'opiosensual'.   
For male opiate/opioid users like myself, the sensual roles are reversed...these compounds are the lovemakers, and people like me are the receivers, the ones who can lie back and relax without anxiety whilst 'the other' does all the work.  
I'm no MGTOW, but I do not have the motivation to chase women for sex...and back when I did and was successful, I came out the other side thinking, ""that sure did take some time and energy"". I questioned the whole charade, even if the sex was good and the lady was beautiful: everyone's breath smells in the morning though, right?   
So for those who are romantically inactive, did you fall further and further out of it as the substances lowered your testosterone? Did you renounce sex with humans first, and then go on to these, and perhaps other substances too, to fill the sensual void left behind? Was it a really quick turnaround in a ""wow, these are better than sex! Opiates are my new love and I'm not looking back!"" kind of way? For me, opiates blew sex and masturbation away completely...and not masturbating or having sex intensifies psychedelic trips anyway, which is advantageous. I'd rather abstain and use the saved-up sexual energy to hallucinate that I'm having energy intercourse with a goddess anyway, than ride the endless merry-go-round of dating.  
Eros takes on many forms, the not-so-humble poppy of pleasure being one of them. I wrote in one of my notebooks: Eros ---> sex, erotic dreams and nocturnal emissions, opiates, celibacy and semen retention, erotic psychedelic trips, eunuchs, creativity.  
So, are you opiosensual who is in love with the poppy? Are you opiosensual but still have a romantic life? Or is it another mundane thing that does not deserve this new name that I've given it?

This is just a thought and wondering if any of you think the same thing or different?

So in the States and Canada there is an epidemic of F. In my town we call them Death Dealers. Thousands of people have died in B.C and Alberta just this year in Canada and by the stats this is the worst drug epidemic of all time Right Now. Holy fuck what the hell happened? I have a theory on how it started ( just a thought if im wrong i wont be surprised).

&#x200B;

So 8 Years ago in the U.S Oxycontin was discontined(2014 in Canada) and Docs were put on notice by the media witchhunt and Gov morons to be more stingy with Opoids(pill mills being shut down which fed most of the country  Pharma safe gear). So you have all these people used to getting there fix from a safe opoid of there choosing at a not bad price due to volume of product being put out.

&#x200B;

To put it simply i imagine this created quite a vacum and drought of opoids as time went on. Without missing a step the death dealers moved there F into pressed O.Cs and Roxys. Heres a situation-Youve been out of O.Cs for 2 days and sick, depressed and most of all bored, you call your neighbourhood Dealer"" No Oxy but i do have this other stuff and it will blow your head off"" without knowing the danger as F wasn""t mainstream back then you have a line. Without realizing you just done the most dangerous and addictive opiate in the world. Im sure many roads didnt go to well with the switch from Pharma Safe to pressed 10000x More potent than morphine.

&#x200B;

As the drought of opoids continued the flood of F Grew. Opoid prices went up which pushed users to H that prolly has F in it. Perfect storm for the users of North America. Fast foward to today what is everybodys thoughts. Did the Gov stupidly set up a lay up for one of the worst epidemics in History?  The Cat is out of the bag clearly but any ideas on how to help and do some damage control? Pharm Heroin clinics perhaps? Pharmacies giving free F test kits? 

&#x200B;

In my opinion Adults should have the right to choose what they put in their bodys, and that all drugs should be legalized and be able to buy safely in a pharmacy OTC.  Would addicts have to rob if they could afford their gear for 5$ a day from a pharm instead of spending 100+ a day?

I had to drive about 45 minutes to meet him, really nice neighborhood (like im talking oceanfront homes) and he pulls up in a different bmw than the last time. Saw him a few days ago and picked up about 15 30mgs. They were the white RP 30s, needless to say i wasn’t to enthused about it as I knew they probably weren’t the best, and i was right.. even taking a whole one it kept the WDs away but not much more. Anyways, i go meet him for 15 blues this time, he pulls up, hands me the pills, I hand him the cash and then he pulls out another small baggie.. says to “try it out and let him know”. I’m immediately thinking that its H as he asked me the other night if i needed any “chi” which I assumed was china white (I live on the left coast) I thought all we get is BTH. I hand the baggie to my gf hoping its some coke, as thats what shes into, but we both smelled it and from gaining some expertise on here I was looking for a vinegar smell. There was none. So I’m assuming it was probably straight fent? It was almost grey it was so off-white. It also felt really mushy and dense, not like coke where its noticeably dry,tougher powder. 
Why I’m posting is because I’ve been feeling a bit guilty about my oxy habbit lately, I dont even like to think about how much ive spent the last few months, I just feel like a shit person because I got handed some H.

I see how you guys warn the noobs not to even start this life. 

So. About me. I’ve been heroin-free for over 8 years now, and meth-free for 11. I’m honestly a tweaker by nature but heroin found its way into my life due to a series of very unfortunate events. Don’t get me wrong, I love tar like a brother, but it’s not my main jams. I really only like heroin because it shuts down my PTSD and makes me not have to live in this reality. I do not appreciate this reality due to many factors, and many traumas in my life. I crave heroin most when I’m in pain. 

At the moment I’m facing many things from my very sordid past and it’s just really sucking. However my present life is actually not too bad. I have a lot going for me, which is the main reason I haven’t cracked and used h in the past 8 years. I’m doing it more out of fear of losing everything, going to jail, losing housing, ruining my relationship (he’s very special), losing my job (which I love dearly), rather than actually caring if I’m off heroin.

So it was all I could take today not to cold cop off the various potentials I could have hit up just on the streets today. I live in a socially and economically depressed area.

The past several hours have been a bit of an odd blur. The sort of temporal shift one might only find in a Nolan film. I was all set with my buffet of garbage food. Enjoyed a full bag of H which I'd picked up earlier from the dboy. It hit rather hard, and wasn't long before I knew enjoying my eats and treats was going to require more coordination than I readily possessed. 

Somehow I'd acquired two cheeseburgers and a chocolate milkshake from McDonald's. Oh, that sweet tasty shake went down ever so smooth. I now realize the cheeseburgers are simple overkill, but I musn't waste food.

As I nodded in and out trying to get the burger to my mouth, I enjoyed an episode of breakingbad. Every so often I'd come to with my burger resting against my chest, me rocking it to sleep just as I'd nodded myself off to la la land. I was able to eventually get the burger to my mouth, though chewing was a whole new project of its own. So thirsty. Where's my powerade. Oh, poured out on the floor. You know, I'm just going to put the burger down for a sec. and check my phone.

Oh, my buddy is going to call me to catch up on how I've been. About 20 minutes later I'd composed the text: ""Nah, rain check I'm having a sick and then I'll hollar at you when I find it"". Send. 

I better get the rest of my powerade, I'm thirsty. [INSERT PERIOD OF BLACKNESS]

I awake three hours later on my courch with quite the belly ache. Not one of a stew of vomit churning about, but more of a abdominal distention; a belly packed with yesterday's and todays culinary trespasses. A colon packed tightly with poo that will soon be chuckling at me as it rips my asshole and leaves a dookie the size of a forearm floating in my commode. 

Enough to make this a one off stumble? Hopefully. 

Now, I will munch a few sour patch kids as I mull over my life and ponder the meaning of it all.

But remember lads, today me, tomorrow you. ",1535159948.0

Day after I try the 40 neos and wayyyyyy different feeling I was knodding off sorta and felt very strong and just og oxy feeling alot different than the 80 crushis. Tried the 80 neos time release one's and tf they don't chew just sorta fell apart in my mouth but felt like real oxy. The 80 crushis looked hella weird green color was spotted on pill and the powder inside pill was bitter I thought fent has no taste or they probs added something to make them bitter basically what are your thoughts on the oxy game up in Canada Alberta??? Are people starting to press oxys up here with fent even the 80 neos??? I've never had any fent pressed pills before and no smoke shop sells fent test strips and I've been picking up off my plug for over a year and he's never ever sold me fent until this last time or maybe it wasn't who knows fents just a big joke now just normal thing now I guess,1535147877.0

I went about a week and a half not passing stool at all. I was using constantly, with subs in between. No space on the calendar without opiates.

Then, one day when I used, I had the following symptoms:

• Bloating  
• Horrible Sulphur burps, very long ones  
•Awful Gas  
•Abdominal pain  
• Explosive diarrhea  
• Feeling like something was backed up on my intestinal tract  

I didn't think much of it because I have usually had a BM that was a solid log AT LEAST once a week.

Another few days pass and I use again and the exact same symptoms appear. At this point I only have liquid stool, with small bits of solid. At this point I am scared. I stop using all opiates.

The day after, I had a VERY small amount of solid stool, and in the following days I took every laxative imaginable ( senno, docusate, PEG, enemas, milk of magnesia ) and only had either liquid stool or very small slivers of very soft solid stool. I have literally no appetite. I could easily go the entire day without thinking about eating once. I can feel a huge, immobile mass somewhere in my gut. Enemas do nothing and I am very scared.

My question is this: Does the fact that I have stool at all rule out the possibility of an impaction? Can it move around/squeeze around the traffic jame so to speak? I have a doctor's appointment for monday. Any help/advice (besides ""Hey make sure you eat more fiber) would be appreciated.  It has been probably 21+ days since I've had a significant amount of solid stool.",1535128415.0

After midnight there was only one place we could get black on the streets. And it was actually black mixed with cocaine, what we called one on ones because of the one to one ratio of coke to heroin. They were Rufus’s favorite. I never liked them as much as Rufus did because whatever the chemical mixture did to my heart always caused me to immediately and uncontrollably retch up vomit the color of green highlighter ink. Rufus would be dancing down the sidewalk like it was the best day of his life after we each spiked a vein with the concoction. I would stumble behind him moaning and lost with strands of stinky slime hanging from my chin.

But when we did, we always bought the one on ones, which came in multicolored balloons slightly smaller than grapes, a dozen blocks from where we slept. They came from a Guatemalan guy named “Chato,” who had been born and raised in the capital city there. The guy always had a smile on his face and spoke little English. The first time we went, Rufus explained to me that “Chato” meant “shorty” or “the short one.” It was a nickname originating from slang spoken in the jungles in Peru.

“What do you mean Peruvian jungle slang?”

“Slang is like a way of speaking that is less than proper. You know, like how we talk on the streets or whatever.”

“I know what slang is.”

“Okay, then, just figure that there is a certain brand of slang spoken in the jungles of Peru. That’s where the name “Chato” comes from.” 

“I get that.”

“Then what’s the question?”

“Didn’t you say he was from Guatemala?”

“I did, and he is.” We slowed to let a car pass in front of us. Rufus lit a cigarette.  

“Then why does he have a nick name native to the jungles of Peru?”

“Hmmmm…. I don’t know. I’ve never thought about it. Most people don’t realize that Peru and Guatemala are different places when I mention it.”

“They are, though.”

“Yes. They are, very far apart and very different. Where did you learn all of this?”

“I might ask you the same thing, but what I really want to know is how you know they are different places and that a Guatemalan going by a Peruvian handle makes absolutely no sense but never asked yourself.” We approached the squat man standing under an overhang wearing a plaid shirt and gray beanie. He smiled at us. He wore a black strapped back pack.  

“Good point, but here he is. What are we getting?” 

“You said 20 a piece, right?”

“Yeah. But he does 3 for 50.”

I never found out why the Guatemalan had a Peruvian nickname. I never found out how Rufus knew all those things about Guatemala and Peruvian slang. There were other things Chato could mean depending on where it was used, but he specifically said it was the way they used it in Peru. And I never found out how Rufus managed to avoid questions about it all, but I did do my first one on one with him behind a dumpster taking turns holding the flashlight for each other. As we walked back up towards our spot, he danced. I stumbled and puked. ",1535122548.0

A long while ago I had come across a website that detailed all the world's countries (or most) and what their methadone laws and regulations were, both for locals and for travellers. I thought I had bookmarked it as I knew I would eventually need this information, but I guess I must have been high and fucked up that one simple task. This website said if you could bring methadone into the country as a tourist and if there were any time restrictions (for example, like you could only bring in a 3 day supply) . It also said if methadone wasn't prescribed in that country but you were still allowed to bring in a certain amount as a tourist. I think it also noted if it was possible to get a prescription locally once you've arrived.

This info is super important to me for helping me choose which country I go to on exchange in university. I'm considering a country in Eastern Europe but for privacy reasons I'm not naming it.

I'm also wondering if anyone ever went for a semester or two abroad and what were the logistics of trying to arrange a prescription transfer to a new clinic in the new country you're studying in. Does traveller's insurance cover this? Did you get the same amount of carries you had before? Was it a pain in the ass to set it all up? Anything I should know?

I was taking quetiapine as a sleep aid (which has action on some of the same receptors as risperidone) and I had really bad sleep paralysis.

> Greater Boston area. Have been getting blues from this same group of guys for awhile. Always been straight script pills. My usual dose is 30mgs oral and 15 msg 45 minutes after the initial dose. These K9s were absolutely flawless and had consistent color, sheen, and durability as all the other K variation oxys. Well I ate one and instantly noticed that the taste was really weak and was def not oxy. I waited a good hour and wasn’t feeling much at all where as with a real blue I would be buzzing pretty hard and preparing for the rush from snorting. Well being an idiot I decided to just snort a half of the other pill. Didn’t even feel high for like 10 minutes and just as I was starting to think it was bunk filler presses I got smacked with a surprisingly unpleasant nod. I remember trying to eat a popsicle trying to fight the intense nod taking over me, next thing I know I’m in a haze of paramedics yelling as if they were far away. Kinda remeber puking in the ambulance the second time they narcanned me. They say i was brought back twice, once when they got to me and then I fell out again in the ambulance which was when they sprayed me again and I puked. The whole thing is still a blur but the nurse said they had to use 4 doses of Narcan in total to keep me stable until the Ivs were set up. I’ve already told my boys what happened and the plug said he’s gonna warm people from now on but I fucking doubt that. I got out of the hospital and detox last week and these fuckers are getting around in my town. People are dieing and I gaurentee it’s these K9s

Been on opi for about 8 yrs, which is disgusting/sad to hear for me as I can't recall many eventful things throughout the time. But anyways, I had moved from NJ to the Cali area and had to switch from raw/ecp to the black (BTH) for the first time. Got the hang of IV tar (feels so much worse on the veins compared to powder) but I also learned to appreciate IMing. It seems anytime IM is brought up though, the pitchforks start coming out. So while others may have different thoughts/experiences, for me personally, I have not run into any problems from IM use, even with BTH.

I am not advocating the use, but just want to describe my personal experience with the ROA. I think the problem lies with people confusing Intramuscular (IM) with Subcutaneous, with most thinking of the latter, especially when they talk about a ""miss"" while trying to IV. I think the key to successful IM use is making sure you actually hit the muscle. Longer rigs are obviously easier, I have had to resort to using insulin rigs preferably atleast 1in (have been able to use 1/2in due to sucky pharmacists, but need to push harder into the skin)

I will also admit I learned the hard way as well from not knowing the difference. When I would not successfully reach the muscle during the early stages, I would say an abscess formed about 1/4 to 1/3 of the time. Majority of the time when I failed using IM, a bump would form and be sore for a few days but then eventually dissipate, especially when adding alot of heat as treatment. However the times when an abscess did form, I gotta say it was pretty damn disgusting.

I haven't posted about this as it worried me that I had never seen anyone post or link pics to an abscess that looked similar to mine throughout the many years I've lurked here. I was mainly using the outer upper arm and outer upper hip area before I finally figured it out. But when I did miss subcutaneously, sometimes it would go through the typical abscess formation, with it coming to a point (like a pimple) early on and eventually rupture, with all the pus and nastiness coming out. I would say the typical size of the burst hole is about a quarter, with the overall inflamed area around a golf ball size. I just keep the area dry/bandaged and it eventually healed itself but it was a major pain nonetheless. (Note: for me, they took very long to completely heal. Imagine having an open hole around your waste/hips, or multiple, that slowly leak constantly and takes over 3-4 months to heal)

But other times, the abscess will not come to a head and burst and instead just continue getting sore and heated for a few days. Sometimes it was multiple abscesses that would connect or ""tunnel"" with each other. I had read that you shouldn't force it to burst so I wait until it gets to a stage where I can feel the pressure building and from an old abscess booklet I read, wait for the texture of my skin to feel like a blister and then make my own incision. The dark pus/liquid/debris starts pouring out immediately. And when I apply some more pressure on the harder parts of the bulge, a ton of thick jell-o like black stuff comes shooting out onto the air. Ill hit an end point where nothing else comes out, but it will require a few more daily sessions as more builds up (maybe loosens?), which lessens significantly each time.

The jello like substance appears to be more like coagulated blood and pus, however towards the end of drainage, as it takes a couple days, these dark clumps of what I am guessing is the insoluables from the cut and dead tissue and other nastiness combines. I figure its the former tissue/muscle that used to make up the newly drained hole. Prayed it wasn't the necrosis but after getting as much squeezed out as I can, it slowly starts to heal (from the inside up like any abscess) It's really twisted but I get this weird sort of relief, like a massive blackhead being removed, with larger clumps feeling ""better""? I'm sickened even writing this but I know I keep the incision hole as small as possible as it can still come flying out from pressure. 

I swear the amount of stuff that comes out is mind-boggling. I gently apply pressure from all angles and depending on the size/severity of the abscess, the draining will eventually stop when the pus is all out. I imagine all the solid debris that looks like dark flecks are the insoluble parts of the cut that my body couldnt eliminate? When I had an abscess like this, the size of the open hole was similar to quarter size, but when you softly palmed the area, you could definitely feel a ""hollow"" space under the skin layer where the abscess filled. I am guessing that is the lost tissue/muscle? I only took pictures the first time this happened (upper arms) but I was an idiot (like most addicts) and let this happen around my hip area as well. 

Now I imagine by this point many readers think I should die just from stupidity and being retarded from not going to get medical treatment. I will admit to being embarrassed/shamed of public knowledge of my use as I'm a middle class corporate worker and at the time, I was really worried about the cost for treatment and somehow scheduling it without my family finding out, and most importantly, it wasn't really that painful and didn't notice any other symptoms. Repeat, the pain was not unbearable nor did I observe any other negative or ill like symptoms as I monitored myself and would have gone to get help if I even felt remotely worse. I just think common sense goes a long way too, not that I am some special case. Also learned that stressing  out just makes it worse and to remember to think rationally. I seriousle drove myself crazy researching other posts and all the warnings about sepsis, staph, necrofacblabla, amputations, and believe me, those thoughts were definitely in my mind.

Again, I am just stating my experience and learning lessons. I continue to use IV and IM (properly) and have not encountered any abscesses for a while (hope forever). I am definitely an advocate of harm reduction. The aftermath of all this wreckless harm to my body is the skin on my upper arms each have about 3-4 small bump scars from where the abscess holes finally healed. The skin is definitely darker and a but pigmented near the bumps. I was fortunate that they are high enough to not show when wearing a t-shirt. I am not planning to wear any tanks/beaters in public as well. Also, I have similar pigmented/darker patches of skin where the abscesses healed near my hips. Fortunate again as they are right below my waistline and not visible per how I usually dress.

If anyone really wants to see an example, I should be able to retrieve the few pictures I had from my old phone, just let me know and I will try to get it onto imgur asap. It just really grosses me out and I recall erasing some of them.

TL;DR - Have been able to use IM as ROA, even with BTH. But Subcutaneous use lead to abscesses and I found out the hard way.

                             3 year relationship


                                  Background

  Our relationship started January of 2016, approaching 3 years ago. I have been mostly single my entire adult life. I'd been on many dates, this woman absolutely captivated me from day one. After a year of being together, we got our first apartment together. For the first time in my life, I felt fulfilled. Eventually, it felt so right, I proposed. Everything seemed to be falling right into place....

                                     Doin' Time

  In the beginning of our relationship, she was on probation, and had to serve 8 months in a Work release program. If you're unaware of what Work release is, it is essentially a lighter version of jail. You get passes to go places, you're able to go to work, that kinda thing.
  I didn't leave her at that time because I saw past her mistakes. I was so captivated by this woman, I wanted to make a difference in her life, and I succeeded. When she got out, there was a huge difference in her maturity. In those 8 months, that is where we developed true love and best friends. I had also helped her with her son, whom I also developed a relationship. When she got out, we got our first apartment together.

           I don't like the drugs, the drugs like me

  This is the hardest part to discuss, because everyone has their own strong opinion of the matter. Please, try to have an open mind if you can't relate to substance abuse.
  She and I both, have had substance abuse issues prior to meeting each other. It wasn't really a problem in the beginning. It was seemingly casual, up until the past 6 months. 
  One day we went to the store, I ran into a friend of mine I hadn't seen in years. Long story short, he asked me to come by since he lived down the street from us. From that decision on, we quickly fell down a slippery slope. Full blown addiction grasped us. 

                     The beginning of the end

  In the past 6 months, it has been by far the hardest I've lived, she as well for that matter. She caught a possession charge, I got my first DUI. Between finances and the legal system, our relationship has been strained.
  The night she caught her possession charge, obviously she went to jail for 60 days. At the time, I had no idea how long she was going to be there. Had I got my sh*t together in that time, we probably wouldn't be where we are today. With that said, I completely lost my mind. My addiction was the only way I knew to cope with my now broken family. In that time, I gave up my apartment, caught a DUI (my first offense ever). The world seemed to be crumbling right before me.

                            Where we are today

 60 days pass, she finally comes home. By home, I mean a friend who has allowed us to live with her, god bless. I got clean the day she gets out. I had enough of the crap, and it was time to fix this once and for all. 
 Sobriety happened for us for a month, before drugs found us again. A month passes of using, and she quits. House arrest, there is no messing around. She has successfully been sober since, she's been sober for a month. 
   This is the sad part. I have mostly been clean in the month she's been sober, I have slipped. I came home one day, 2 weeks ago, and she could see it in my eyes. One too many times, she had enough. From that day, I haven't touched anything. I went home to my parent's, believing that was it. 2 days pass, she misses me and asked me to come back. We have sex, I love you's are back. 
    As of today, I'm receiving mixed signals. We are back to sobriety and getting along well, but the romance is shifty. One moment she seems to be about working on this, the next she seems unsure. I honestly, don't know where I stand at this point. I don't believe in letting go when times get tough. You get through it and grow. Anyway, that is our story this far....



                                        tl;dr
My girlfriend of three years made the decision to dump me. Considering her reasons, I've truly made the effort to fix the problem. One day she seems to be about the possibility of making it work, the next she's reminding me why it won't. She is still defensive over me as if we are still together, she got overly jealous when her friend wore one of my sweatshirts. Maybe that doesn't matter, but it seems to be a clue something could still be there. Back to the point, I'm unsure how to approach this. Do I stay here at her friend's, and see what happens? Do I decide to go back to my parent's, possibly leaving her for good? I don't have any answers. I have complete determination to make this work after a hard lesson learned. It..means..everything.

I have some limited experience with both as I successfully used DCK for tolerance which helped. I snorted the dose and didn't use any more opiates that day, and it helped me to lower tolerance from 75-100mg a shot to 50mg which was the dose I started with (ie the dose I was taking when I first started using morphine). That was about 2 months after I started taking opiates daily.

I've also used ketamine for managing tolerance (I injected around 35mg) which didn't really help (I used morphine around 3 hours after K).

I took the same dose of ketamine few days later and it helped me with withdrawals (I've been using morphine (at doses around 300mgs daily) and other opiates for 4 months at the time). I haven't experienced any physical symptoms but mentally I didn't make it and started using morphine again after 3 days.

What are your experiences? Do you have any research papers on that matter? How should I administer ketamine to lower tolerance?",1535068011.0

There is no room for feelings or weakness. Many have been consumed by its vast pitfalls. Many still dance on the edges of certain doom. But there is a power that comes from knowing how to navigate in the danger, and it becomes intoxicating. Regular life, the life of a “citizen” as I have come to describe it, loses its flavor. One begins to crave the taste of risk, the rush of broken laws and the way surviving the street each day feels like destiny manifested. 
But after so long, inevitably the rush and the euphoria fades, just like the chemicals one may have been seeking when he first began to foray into the street. Things we are so quick to take for granted in our old lives disappear, like regular hygiene and steady employment. The chaos wears us thin, and we begin to shut off more and more to the outside world, receding deep within where physical and emotional pain can no longer hurt us. We worship at the feet of a god who knows not our name or our path. We drill down onto whatever false savior we have aligned ourselves to with the focus of a surgeon. Our salvation is always within our reach, in the bottle or the pipe or the needle. It never judges. It never questions. It never notices.
When the day of reckoning arrives, if one is fortunate enough to reach that day, it is a stark and terrifying truth we are forced to confront. The drugs stop working. The bonds and the routines betray us, and we are once again empty, stumbling deeper into the vast emptiness of our own tattered souls. Two paths are presented. One is the path we have been running from for so long, we know immediately where it leads. It is the path of living a purpose driven life, filled with obligation, accomplishment, love, disappointment, plans for the future, failure, despair, joy, and so much more. The path to a life lived is one we have the greatest fear of taking. 
The other path, dark and treacherous, beckons to us, but we can feel the danger and the deceit that hides along its jagged rocky outcroppings. This is the path to death. A sad and lonely death is the only destination. Usually those who choose this second path are the catalyst that rockets them toward that shallow grave. It’s is the only escape for the lost and broken soul who can no longer find refuge in the false gods he once served. 
The human mind and body are not indestructible; there is a limit to the amount of suffering and utter despair one can endure. Offer prayers of love and forgiveness for those of us who have given in to the path of oblivion, for no earthly creature can truly say they have found true peace. No one can save a man who has journeyed down the path of oblivion, and too often it is true that turning back becomes impossible. Mercy and peace to them all. Mercy and peace to the livers of life as well. Both paths require courage and fortitude. Both are harrowing and often offer no quarter.",1535064418.0

I call him back and he tell me thats wat i ASKed 4.

Seems H can get out of hand real quick and tolerance obviously builds fast so i got up to about a bundle a day. I definitely don't feel like i NEED a bundle to avoid sickness and assume half of that would be sufficient enough to avoid sickness while dropping my tolerance but unsure as its my first time doing this.

Can anyone recommend a practical plan for someone whos been doign a bundle a day for about 2 months? should i cut it in half for a week and then drop 25% per week from there on out? would love some tips from veterans, thank you.

TLDR: What % of a drop from daily use would you recommend for someone trying to ween off of a bundle per day habit? Been snorting this amount for about 2 months. I assume its not very strong stuff either in case that matters, don't have much to compare it to...

I will say that speed was a much more toxic addiction for me than opiates, that stuff drove me crazy and very easy to lose control of your mind(amp psychosis) and make your appearance look terrible. This lasted 2 years and i had developed a huge auxiety disorder and felt terrible( panic attacks when i was out couldnt sleep),this led to me standing with my Mom talking next thing i know im on the ground(Huge headrush and lost control of my body). i checked into detox for 5 days  after that, they gave me 2 10mg valium during my stay. Havent touched speed or alcohol since.

&#x200B;

Downers,psychedelics, and valhalla  

When i got out i went to my doctor and explained my situation and was prescribed .5mg clonazepam 4x daily for my auxiety. It worked and the cravings for speed and alcohol left completly. Benzos Benzos Benzos goddawn i thought quitting speed was hard, anyone whos been on heavy does of benzos for months on end knows what i mean when you quit cold turkey. My girlfriend recommended shrooms and that changed my whole life(i looked at myself in a new perspective and didnt like what i seen) stopped benzos completly(still use Xanax every now and then) and went on a journey through my mind-acid mescaline   and god of them all DMT(what a trip). No more auxiety since none its almost like the DMT changed something in my brain and i was at peace with myself and still am( this is not a sad story im doing great which is why im writing this).

At this stage im 20 have a great job, great girlfriend, my own place life is good and still is. I was out moutain biking and hit a turn and ran straight into a thick branch of a tree. Broke my collarbone ( doctor gave me nothing but anti infammitory) but my friend gave me some perks 5/325. Holy Fuck is all i have to say about the first time i got high on opiods it felt like heaven on earth and in my mind was the perfect high. Started getting 25 every month and would take around 20mg a day till i ran out. Best sex of my life was on Oxycodone i dont know if its just me but does it ever put me on that level. This went on for 6 months or so but after awhile i found out that the tylenol was bad for my liver so on to oxycontin. But it was discontined and i hate Neos they make me itch soo bad. As some of you know there still going strong in other parts of world.

&#x200B;

At this stage im 21 still have my job, a different girlfriend, and still renting my own place and getting 14 O.C 80s every month. Im using 40mg a day(still do) and living my life happily. I take a 2 week break every 2 months.

Here i am at 24 still doing the same thing and still on my same dose every night when i get off work. I have my own house now and a new car thats paid off no girlfriend atm though. Oxycodone seems to not affect me like the speed or benzos, im addicted no question but im a functioning addict and healthy person for the most part. The reason im writing this is because everywhere i read that if your on opiates your gonna end up shooting up and ruining your life etc etc. In my opinion through my 4 years of use opiods are not hard on your body and you can live your life perfectly fine while on them. I find with opiods you just have to take breaks so your dopamine has time to recover. Iv only ever used them orally and at my height was using an 80 a day.   Have any of you had the same experience? Have any of you been able to go 10 years while being a functioning addict compared to my 4? I feel like opiates get a bad rap but when your not to greedy and live a healthy lifestyle you can function just fine in my opinion. Im sorry for the long post thank you for any input:)

Will post some pics once i fugure out how to do it discreetly.

I was all over the place when I wrote that post. I didn’t know how to cope. My mum got diagnosed with cancer, I found out that my wife beating alcohol father who who presumed missing only died a died a few weeks ago and my sister died two weeks ago. They’ve changed the immigration laws in oz, despite the fact that my son, partner and ex partner are all Australian it’s almost impossible to get a job despite being highly qualified. I’m very well known in another field and got fucked over brutally in ways I cannot describe because someone women choose to us their vagina and a demonstration of their talent. 

I get the impression that some people get preferential treatment on here. Stories of people losing custody of their children, losing their children altogether, getting away with major felonies as well as stories of extreme violence towards other individuals and leavings others to do OD. 

I’m not looking for sympathy, i don’t want it in any shape or form.

I wrote the post in a rush as I needed to vent to a community that i thought would understand the plight of an addict. Let me clarify a few things. I hadn’t taken taken anything except the cannabis which I was did not intentionally take. Not an excuse. I see so many posts about people driving high or after having taken a shot and most don’t get the same reactions. My last dose of Xanax was 36 hours before the incident. My lose dose of H was 8 hours before the incident. I did not take any in my kids presence and never did and have never have. I was starting to go through mild WDs. I’ve been using for two months after my ten year relapse. Not an an excuse but I had no idea the vape pen had cannabis in it. 

A lot of things were phrased incorrectly, i was just telling you guys what I had left and wondering what to do what that gram. I’ve sold it to a some guy who used to middle for me and using the money for therapy. 

The child was born without my consent. The court granted me full custody but a child needs his father and and I never had one growing up. He sought therapy, worked on himself and became a better person. 

The police got me to drive physically get into the car and drive it into a safer spot. My encounters with the NSW police has not been great in the past- they didn’t give a shit when all my my stuff got robbed or when I got mugged but they were amazing. They’re experienced enough to not to let someone who is fucked up beyond belief not to do that. 

The hospital and police report says I suffered from a seizure. They both noted my my first priority was my child and that he was an extremely happy young boy with a strong bond towards me. 

When I said the gram is gone and I’m done, I meant either sell it or flush it. I chose the former and used the money for CBT.

I’m not a nasty or malicious person. I give and I give until nothing is gone. I have my child my life even thought he was the product of rape the best that I could. When I’m at my lowest I always help others. I have never ever reached out to anyone for help. Any time I reached out for help to my mother, it was a torrent of abuse, malice and insults for something as simple as wanting a little bit of a help with my maths tests or picking an outfit. My life was strictly controlled to every extent despite having started school two years early and excelling beyond belief. Last night’s post has taught me that reaching out for help or venting no matter what will bring me back to square one. 

Medical professionals often treat us like scum because they’ve never been there. A huge part of me wants to call it quits because this isn’t something i can do alone. You guys are right, I am a piece of shit and my loved ones are better off without me. I can’t do this alone. You guys are right, I’m just a junkie piece of shit who doesn’t deserve anyone around me.

I sincerely hope that those trying or struggling to stay clean get there. Shoot me a message while I’m still around if you need to vent. ",1535011064.0

The grateful dead have become the band people patronize through jokes about drug filled fans who only love songs so long cause the drugs.

The grateful dead created alternative rock music and the idea of concerts. They played bluegrass before becoming the dead. They took weekend festivals bluegrass bands began in rhe early 60s and decided rock music should have the same. So they pulled together Monterey pop, Altamont, the free love in, sunshine day dream, and. Even the Woodstock promoters got help from the band/band,manager.

Their philosophy has always been making a living through ticket sales. Real musicians play live and sound better,than any studio recordings. It's impossible to recreate the synergy, chemistry a band gets playing live.  They have acoustic ballads, country songs, blues songs, jazz songs, covers, funk, first adopters of electronic music ( now edm.), they have songs 4 minutes long to 48 minute long meditative journeys, pop songs, old rock n roll songs, blue grass songs, and psychadelic space time ripping orchestras your brain can only hold on to as it makes you dive deep in the brain.  

They have over 2400 songs in their catalog.  They never play a song the same way twice. A song played Friday night might have a guitar solo in a completely different scale mode/category/type Tuesday night's version has. Played by the piano between a different verse too.

They improv together and the songs are long because they either jam one song into another, or write songs meant to morph into the next without stopping. I often find myself holding my breath, or feel my heart beating through my chest when they play. They build up whole concerts with separate waves of energy over 6 to 8 hours. Slowly building to songs rocking like the freebird solo speed, or so delicate, one tickle of the piano ivory keeps the beat of an old gospel tune.


The dead had 4 main singers. Jerry is only one of the two main. Bobby is the other and I prefer his songs better. They were forced to after their main singer died in 72. In the 80 to 90s, young Brent brought his songs and voice.


Listen to them. I guarantee they're not at all what you expect. Lmk and ill give you a show to listen to. Live is how thru want to listen. They've always encouraged the audience to record and give the shows away for free. From 65 to 95. Every show is available for free and the soundboard recording to. Pristine.

Even the acid tests. Where you bought a ticket and you got a cup out of multiple huge trash cans filled with koolaid and lsd.


Unfortunately, jerry died when he checked into rehab. His heart gave out starting his detox. He started smoking heroin in the late 70 s and continued off and on til his death. Brent died of a speed ball too. The rest of the members ALWAYS tried getting,them to stick to anything but dope. I'm with them.


Get at me. I bought my first live show at Xmas at 14. I still listen to the dead and the stories their songs tell are priceless. Songs for any situation in life. 

Tldr: listen to the dead. People always connect the dead to heroin. I wanted to clarify it was only a big part of jerry's life and he didnt shoot it. He also died trying to get clean.",1534988671.0

Like do they test an already cleaned off baggy for for microscopic residue just to charge you or can you have a tiny bit on you and not get charged etc.? I'm asking cause my purse has a secret pocket (I guess not so secret now) I made that I keep things like my hit kit and tooters (for smoking,) any other random paranaphelia and small amounts of drugs (which I also keep in a separate hiding place in my purse.) The drugs are usually meth and sometimes heroin. I know that people aren't idiots though and could probably notice things like there being things in my purse if they were looking through it that they can't seem to find if they touched it which would lead them to the ""secret"" pocket so I'm just wondering if I shouldn't keep like old bags and slightly dirty tooters that may have residue on them in case I get searched (why do people get searched anyway, like for what reason could a cop search me and my stuff?) Is there a certain number of baggies you can have on you cause I heard if you had a certain amount (I""m not sure how much though) you'd get charged with selling but those things accumulate fast when you buy small bags and my mom spends most of her time at home so it's hard to clean out my purse at least really frequently (our walls are thin.) And how much time do you think I would be looking at if I did get caught with them? I know it sounds pretty fucking dumb to carry those things around in your purse but I live with my parents and they don't know as far as I know and so I can't do them in the house when they're not there and it looks normal to leave with my purse or a backpack as apposed to my hit kit out in the open etc. I can also bring my purse into the bathroom and still look normal so they don't go through it and throw out my stuff when I'm taking a shower and stuff so it has it's advantages too. My parents do know that I have a past at least with drugs though just fyi so I bet they do go through my stuff when I'm not there  bc they did even before I started doing hard drugs.

I'm looking for advice but I'm not really sure if this is the right subreddit to post asking this. I'll go into more detail if needed but here's a TLDR at the beginning to save you a read: to sum things up, I have severe pain in both my hands as well as wide spread aches and stiffness in my entire body, though not as severe as my hands. My bones feel like dust. I feel like I've been poisoned down to my bones. I've had a plethora of tests done and they havnt shown anything so far. My doctor refuses to give me any opiates stronger than Tramadol. What can I do to get stronger painkillers or even better any idea what might be wrong with me and how I can cure it so I don't need painkillers?

My doctor incorrectly believes tramadol is not addictive though it definitely is. I took it years ago for back pain and had horrible withdrawals when I came off it. He gave me a weeks worth of oxycontin when I first presented with the severe hand pain and it's only gotten worse since then. He gave me oxycontin 10mg twice daily as I was in tears the pain was so severe. It helped a little but now he's refusing to give me anything other than Tramadol and/or anti-inflammatorys despite the fact I told him they are barely touching the pain and have awful side effects. (Brain zaps and affecting my mood). Im talking 100mg tramadol 3 times a day so quite a large dose bit it's barely helping at all. He won't even give me codeine for some bizarre reason even though it's weaker than Tramadol. I've taken that before and never had the same negative side effects that tramadol causes. I've tried talking to him and rayionalising the situation and begging and talking some more and he won't even let me talk/ask about a morphine based stronger opiate anymore. All of this is really starting to stress me out and I feel incredibly sad hopeless and depressed. He keeps going on about my age and how I shouldn't be taking these at my age (I'm 26 but feel 80 right now). I don't see how it matters what age I am as the medicine I'm asking for is addictive to anyone who uses it whether young or old. The pain is so bad now I feel like I'm unable to work. Though obviously I have to work to keep an income. He keeps blaming the medicine board and regulations but it seems like a lie to me or an excuse not to help me. There has been new regulations regarding strong medications like oxycontin being prescribed for short term use only in my country. So I get his point that when the tests aren't pointing to any particular problem he can't really prescribe me strong medication regularly or atleast it's difficult to do so and would attract unwanted attention. But this seems ridiculous to me at the same time because I can barely dress myself in the morning which is not normal for someone my age and it's clear I need something stronger when I'm so much suffering. It feels like hes just covering his own ass and not eilling to help me. He's not even trying to treat the problem in other ways though. I've had to ask him to do tests and explain how medicines work to him. I explained that the side effects tramadol were causing me were likely due to its SSRI activity. He said its not an SSRI. I had to explain to him for 10mins over the phone it was and eventually told him to read the wikipedia page. To his shock it said it was a weak SSRI and he then thought i studied pharmacology. Whereas its basic googling my medication before I take it knowledge. His medical knowledge seems incredibly out-dated. After learning a little bit more about the medication he prescribes probably ten times a day to different patients he still refused to give me something else. Why even give me the week of oxycontin to begin with if it so worrying to him?

I only got an x-ray done on my hands literally today, I had also to ask for it to be done, surely it should be standard practise to give someone an x-ray on day 1 and not after three months of suffering? So ya, this has been ongoing constant severe pain for three months and I feel like I'm going crazy. I honestly can't take it anymore. Before you say it also doesn't seem to be mental illness related, as no matter how stressed or down or happy I feel on any given day. The pain is still there. I can be very stressed or upset and it does not get worse. It has however steadily been getting worse over time. When my hands first got sore it was just mild stiffness and I felt no need to go to the doctor or even take an ibuprofen, but now I can barely use my phone. It is a huge effort to type all this out so thank you for baring with me.

I dont have the technical names for the tests to hand right now but I can get these if needed. Tests done so far include: white blood cells, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, inflammation, vitamin levels, mineral levels and all other standard blood tests. According to all these tests I am perfectly healthy and show no signs of inflammation. However my hands and feet do swell up every now and again so I don't understand how I have no inflammation whatsoever. I'm in constant pain all the time, aches and bad stiffness all over my body. I sleep ok and eat relatively healthy. I also have a bad, sharp, pain in my neck. Widespread muscle tension, fatigue and occasional nausea. It feels like I've had the flu and two broken hands for months now. Pain does not travel down my entire arms so it doesn't appear to be a pinched nerve in my neck causing the hand pain. It is just isolated severe pain from my wrists to my fingers. 

I was also referred to a private rheumatologist. This was also no help whatsoever. He charged me a small fortune for a short ten minute meeting and told me I have tennis elbow and fibromyalgia, he conducted just one test: patting and squeezing my arms. He squeezed a pressure point on my elbow very hard and I said ""ow!"". He later didn't seem to listen to me when I said my elbows were fine that it was my hands that hurt. He then proceeded to give me a steroid injection into each elbow and prescribed me low dose naltrexone. This didnt help at all. Naltrexone is not a licenced treatment for either fibromyalgia or tennis elbow either. Neither of these diagnosis really match up with my symptoms either but maybe im biased because I dont like that theres no test for fibromyalgia. But that's besides the point. That was the only treatment I've received beside painkillers and anti infammatorys and nothings working. There is no test for fibromyalgia so it sounds like a bit of a throwaway diagnosis to me. I feel like the doctors just can't figure out what's wrong with me so they do and say whatever they can to get rid of me or pass me onto someone else and just don't try and help me. I'm spending so much money on all of this. I'm giving my resignation into work tomorrow because I can't cope with it any longer. It's too painful and I'm missing too much days as it is. It doesn't seem right to stay on the payroll when I'm missing so much days.

I am waiting for blood tests results for haemochromatosis, vitamin D deficiency, and thyroid function. I had to ask my doctor to do these tests, he doesn't seem to have any ideas of his own, he doesn't make suggestions to try and figure out what's wrong with me. These could be likely culprits as I'm from Ireland and they are quite common in Irish people apparently. But I'm worried nothing will show up again and I'll be left to suffer with no help treatment or cure in sight.

Does anyone know how I can convince my doctor to give me stronger painkillers? Should I stop seeing him and go to another doctor? Does anyone know what might be wrong with me? Most important question but a long shot - does anyone know what could cure me so I don't need to take painkillers?",1534973346.0

A quote once said: “don’t go looking for happiness in all the places that made you lose it”.

I’ve been taking the steps to not do that in life. But the only temporary feeling of normal emotions (including sadness and not limited to happiness) was when I was on some kind of opioid/opiate. 

Yesterday I felt some normality again and felt sad right after knowing once the Vicodin and Valium wear off, I’m back to this robotic state: *numb and empty* —yet full of so many thoughts.

And I’ve been on Suboxone for over 3 months now after I stopped because I’m heading to the military to learn discipline without having my parents alive and all. My support systems feel so distant to me. 

And all these feelings; I know I’m not the only one to experience them: so this means that someone found a way out of feeling like this. Yet I can’t seem to.

I just dosed a drug that I almost hate and I am prescribed, *Adderall*20mg, and it only lasts about two hours; then a blanket of total sadness came over me again: I can’t talk, I feel this impending sadness, tears stuck that I confused that feeling of wanting to cry for wanting to puke —all while sitting on the couch with my family I haven’t saw in a while.

I took my Valium with it too to mellow out. But then now, about 4 hours later I take another dose because I couldn’t shake that feeling of wanting to cry for minutes on minutes. 

And it really seems Suboxone only works for me for about 3 days or so before pooping out.. I feel no different on or off it. So I’m 5 days about without it now.

And then I have my girlfriend bitching at me on the phone while she’s at work saying how my actions effect others, I didn’t go up to get my Suboxone filled, I keep missing appointments —and I’m 100% aware of the consequences of my actions but it’s like I’m stuck. I can’t even lift a limb. 
It’s like a “psychomotor retardation” feeling is the best way I can describe it.

No amount of time at therapy as helped me through this. Not any medications except temporarily using them: their effects diminish after a few days. A daily regimen feels imperative.

Guys I really don’t know where to turn now. I feel no escape from this nor coping mechanism except a pill. All my old methods doesn’t help me much. Even slow progress.",1534972769.0

The dinging is quickly pushed out of my head as My body reminds me that I’m sick...I hadn’t forgotten and I can’t wait another second. I know this is a major nono and my dboy would chew me a new asshole and probably block my number if he found out I was getting ready to use in the stairwell but all that could be dealt with once I had gotten well.


I worked quickly and soon enough I had it all laid out ready to go. I ready my straw bring my phone screen up and as I hear another annoying. DING! I inhale, no better feelings exists  then when you go from Sick to well.  I honestly can’t think of a single thing that is better. I hurriedly get the deed done and begin my descent down the piss smelling and cigarette butt laden staircase. I hit the first floor and walk back into the sun. Only this time it’s not oppressive and unbearable like it had been just 5 minutes earlier! 
 
Now  I embraced the warmth and the rays of light danced and flickered through the leaves of the trees. I could feel my legs starting to regain strength, the cramps in my calves finally subsiding thank god! I cross the street to the corner deli looking for the homeless kid I’ve seen the last few days, I had planned on buying him a cig and some lunch but he was no where to be found. I gave up went in the deli got myself a dew code red and 5 looseys and went on my way lighting up a cig as started to walk towards to subway. 

This was the most rundown ghetto part of town I had ever been in while doing dope. I would never bring my gf (my ex gfi mean) down here. One cause I don’t want her to see that besides the color of my skin I fit in pretty well down here. I made that mistake once before showing of my knowledge of the shit part of queens. It didn’t go over well and was met with a lot of suspicion. The other reason was I didn’t want things to go wrong while  I was here and her ending up hurt or robbed. 

As I walked a homeless woman approached me asking to by her a metro card when I told her I had planned in hopping the turnstile she then asked for a dollar when I reiterated that I was JUMPING THE TURNSTILE, she then focus on what was left of my cigarette. Out of pure aggravation I gave her what was left maybe 1/4 of a Newport. I pulled a very English move an tutted as I walked away upset that I once again felt compelled to give away my hard earned cigarette. These people don’t realize that 9/10 they have more money than I do. That soon enough I would be on the streets with them. Why? Because drugs. Drugs always seem to take precedence. I’ll look for a job once I get well I tell myself daily. Then I get well and no job is searched for...

Anyways. I walk back to the subway realizing I had a few more dollars than I normally do I went to McDonald’s to eat. Again my first meal in about 18 hours. I do another bag in the bathroom when I arrive but for once I intend on sticking around and buying something. 

After I eat and smoke a second cig I descend into the subway to hop a train and begin the long grueling subway ride back to where I live. And that’s where I am right now. Sitting on an uptown 4 express train waiting patiently to get back home. Where reality surely awaits me.

I'm coming to you as a sister of someone who IVs Heroin and Meth. A short background: He's been in the life for about 8 years. Been to rehab 2 times and had a year sobriety about 5 years ago. He then began a relationship with a woman and it is toxic. They began to use together and have been for quite sometime now. Things recently came to a head. They're broke, fight all the time, his health is shit, and her kids have been taken away (which he was really invested in). We have known he was using again as it became very obvious, but recently learned that he was now doing meth too. So the question is:

As a user, what would it take for you to go to treatment? NOT what is your bottom, but how can we approach treatment with him that will give us a better chance to support him and get him there.

How would you want someone to offer a non-judgemental hand? 

In the past we have used tough love, we have no leverage. He talks about going but feels guilty for leaving his girlfriend at her lowest, (may just be an excuse). Is it a good idea to help her find treatment too? She is not close with us and really distances herself because of the drugs. 

Our current approach is letting him open up to us which seems to be working but very slow. His life is running out, we cant wait anymore. He legit could be dead right now and we wouldn't even know.

So I had accumulated some clean time and felt the need to reward myself obviously (junkie logic) leading me to drive into the nearby city with a decent hood to score in. The shit is pretty much all dope/fent or pure fent down here in Florida. Head to my usual spot, start walking around and getting asked what I needed but I'm a pretty discerning customer when cold copping (been burned by weak/bunk product too many times to count) so I mostly refused and kept searching for someone familiar. Finally saw a group of guys I'd cold copped from a bunch of times and their shit was always straight so I bought a bunch and headed back to my car. I no longer had an apartment in the city so I drove to a nearby spot I used to use to fix when I would be in withdrawal because while I totally disagree with driving high, I think we can all agree driving after you've gotten right is MUCH safer than driving in withdrawal. 

  
Parked my car and turned on some jams. I was expecting to fix and then go for a walk and get some food or just enjoy the city since I didn't want to be driving if I was actually high (it's not like I was in withdrawal and getting right). Did my usual ritual, prepped the shot, found a vein which was super easy since I'd be clean everything had healed pretty nicely and shot up a baggie. Normally, a bag is enough to get me well and in my excitement from copping for the first time in a while and preparing to get fucked up, I forgot to account for the fact I had absolutely no tolerance and a single bag from these guys would have me nodding hard/knocked out when I was shooting $100/day. 

  
The last thing I remember thinking is ""Wow this is really good shit I'm super fucked up"" and then there's literally nothing. It's just like there's a hole in my memory until I feel something on my face and I try to pull it off and someone goes to stop me. That's when I realize I'm lying in the back of an ambulance on oxygen and telemetry. Apparently an off duty cop wandered by and saw me knocked out in the front seat of my car in this parking lot and was unable to rouse me. 

&#x200B;

At this point the ambulance hasn't gone anywhere, we're still in the parking lot while they continue to monitor my vitals and ask me what I took. I kept insisting I hadn't taken anything but my prescribed anti-anxiety drugs and that I was just really sleep deprived. They obviously didn't believe me since they explained it took two narcan shots to bring me around. At that point I was pretty mentally with it but freaking the fuck out about my car which contained paraphernalia and a bunch of dope. I've never gone to jail in my life and I work in an industry where a drug arrest could end my career (healthcare) so now my overdose had turned into a full on panic attack thinking I was legally fucked and my heart rate and breathing were going through the roof. I began insisting I wanted to leave without further treatment and was declining transport/further services. I had to repeat I wanted to leave against medical advice probably 6-7 times because they kept insisting my vitals were too fucked for me to not go to the hospital. I pointed out I was alert and oriented, non-altered with a normal mental status. I knew my rights and I wanted out of the ambulance now. 

&#x200B;

Finally they acquiesced and removed my IV, O2, monitoring leads, etc and had me sign a refusal. They unceremoniously  kicked me out of the back of their rig and then I saw my car. The rear window had been smashed but otherwise it looked fine and my syringe was still on the floor (in plain sight, but undisturbed). There's one problem though, I can't find my keys to get into the car anywhere and it's locked. I asked the paramedics and they said they hadn't seen my keys, it wasn't until one of the local gawkers standing by informed me the paramedics had given my keys to the police officer who's cruiser was on scene. Oh shit, okay I'm completely fucked. Even though I wasn't driving, I had the keys in the ignition to power the stereo and I was in the front seat. They're gonna search my car, find all my shit and slap me with multiple charges. Possession, paraphernalia, DUI, etc.   


I jump into the window and try to grab all the paraphernalia and dope I can and shove it down my underwear as discreetly as possible but I knew I probably didn't get every baggie. Meanwhile, there are gawking members of the general public and several undercovers all hanging around watching my ridiculousness unfold. One of the undercovers demanded to see what was in my hands after I exited my car window and luckily I was able to show him there was absolutely nothing and I insisted I was simply searching for my keys. 

&#x200B;

The uniformed officer in her cruiser on scene though ended up being the primary for the call which is the only thing that saved me. See, this uniformed officer was a young black female who was without a doubt the NICEST most compassionate cop I've ever encountered in my life. Once I found out she was the one with my keys, I walked over and introduced myself and she handed me my keys and told me to park in a different spot so she could pull up alongside me. There's a glimmer of hope. She's handing me the keys and letting me move the car. 

  
I move over to a set of empty spots and a few minutes later after running my license (which was totally clean), she comes up and asks me to get out of the car. She does the same and exits her radio-car and comes to stand alongside me. The first thing out of her mouth is basically ""I could have your ass in jail and your car impounded but you need to get help and that won't do anybody any good"". We then end up having a 30 minute conversation about my schooling, my future, my addiction issues, life in general. Apparently she also has some types of mental health issues as well. The entire conversation was super positive and it was literally just her trying to get me to see how much potential I had and how scoring smack was ruining my life. She actually made me cry at one point.

&#x200B;

Early on in the conversation when I still wasn't 100% sure I wasn't going to jail, she asked if I was Jewish and I said I was half (total lie, but I was desperate) and then she talked about how a Jewish family had helped her family when she was growing up poor and how much respect and admiration she had for the Jews. Her face like completely lit up when I said I was part jewish so you could tell she really loves them (I mean who doesn't love the jews?).

&#x200B;

Once all was said and done, she asked me to get some Gatorade and food and wait a little while before I drive off and if she caught me scoring in this area again she would rip my ass apart. She wasn't going to arrest me or search my car or person or even issue me a citation. She just wanted me to be okay and to get better. She even told me the undercovers who were chilling were telling her I needed to go to jail for DUI cause I was too fucked up to drive but she said that was nonsense because she had an entire conversation with me where should could tell I was completely coherent and she had seen enough addicts and junkies to know when somebody was completely fucked. 

&#x200B;

I'm not gonna say I didn't finish the rest of the dope I bought (albeit MUCH more carefully) over the next few days because I did. But that was the last time I ever bought dope and part of the reason was the compassion of a young black female cop who genuinely wanted to help people be better instead of chasing crime stats by throwing every mofo she sees in jail. I owe this woman my life. ",1534956107.0

To the point: for over a year now, I've been toying with the idea of doing a piece of writing about the drug addicts in my city. My original idea which I've scrapped was a history of my city from the perspective of the alcoholics and drug addicts. That had an interesting angle to make it stand out from other similar articles in it's field. I don't think I could find the motivation now to research our past and corroborate it with the stories of the users though.  
  
So anyway, yeah. There are a small group of junkies that I really get along with, one of whom I've known since before I did dope and the others I've had a fairly close friendship with for a year or more. And I want to tell the stories of these people. Not just them though; we have hundreds of junkies around here, male and female, young and old.  
But unlike you guys in America, barely any of our addicts are well-presented, normal-looking working people to be honest. I know of maybe three of four who have jobs, and maybe two, and myself besides, who you wouldn't know was a heroin addict just by looking.  
They are mostly down-and-outs. I've seen two girls who I thought were Mmmm yummy-looking, funnily enough both since Sunday lol, and one of those actually asked for my number when I met her scoring off the same bloke two nights ago, and she invited me for coffee Monday morning but I didn't go and told her when I get money we'll go, on me. I don't like going anywhere with girls when I'm broke. 

 Butt damn! she keeps blowing up my phone, texting me a helluva lot she's so eager to meet. Maybe she wants drugs? she says it's not that lol but I'm sure it's not just my decent looks she wants haha. I actually know her boyfriend, who she informed me is in prison right now- conspiracy to supply? I think. Second customer of their first line was a copper haha.).  
If I hadn't lost my flat months back she would probably move in with me right now as that's the general idea of what she said the night I met her. All a longer story.  
Me and my ex are not actually together at the moment but we are having a daughter in December, and even if we weren't I know it would hurt her if I slept with someone else. Although, she gets over things pretty rapidly at the worst of times, hmmm. 

  
 Anyway I've gone fully off-track here, sorry guys (any advice lol)...
So yeah, I want to write an article focusing on the drug addicts of my city, but I feel like it should have some kind of angle to make it more interesting and readable, know what I mean? Like the first idea I had, that had the angle of being a local history following the lives of it's addicted inhabitants.  
I can't think of anything I could use to give this piece a unique selling point so I'm hoping you guys, the ones closest to me and my point-of-view, could give me your advice and opinions.  
  
Tl;dr: Read just the first and last paragraphs. I want to write about the junkies in my city. Can anyone help suggest a unique, interesting angle to make it stand out?

I'm done with it all, just over everything about it. It's been a fun and chaotic couple of years but I need to start focusing on the shit around me rather than my hedonistic and selfish goals. Their are to many thing's going on to just keep acting like I can keep acting the way I am and not expect thing's to go south. Met a lot of cool,sick,fucked up,innocent, and not so innocent people but it's time I started acting like I give a fuck about myself and the people around me. Which I sincerely do but I can't have my cake and eat it too. Might stop for a year or two till thing's level out or I might just not come back at all. Time for me to find something productive I can obsess  over that I actually enjoy currently thinking of a few things. I'll still lurk and post but I can't keep doing this to myself and to the people around me. If anything it's the best move, everyone I know is gone or I've lost contact with so that won't be a problem. It's finding an outlet for these urges that is gonna be the trick. But I'm not worried I know I can do this and for the first time I actually want this rather than be forced into it. Kind of excited to see what I can do now that I wanna get serious about starting to create a better version of myself. At least I got some good memories out of this crazy road I've been on. Much love guy's. Always remember no one is so far gone that they can't change as long as you have the drive you can do whatever.

998vo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/998vo6/people_who_are_addicted_and_still_doing_opiates/,10,https://redd.it/998vo6,smileysarah22,People who are addicted and still doing opiates years later... Let me tell you why you may never be able to stop unless I tell u why,"If you had an amazing life let's say when you were clean for all your life and then you took opiates the first time let's say you took some percs or hydrocodone because I doubt a lot of people here went direct to Injecting, smoking, or  snorting..

First of all. When your an opiate virgin you will feel a come up taking it  orally but that feeling to you will feel like a rush. You will feel amazing but because your an opiate virgin, and you have amazing  friends, a place you love to live, a car you love, And a job.... The hydrocodone really is providing 10-20% of the high and the rest is your own brain being grateful about your own happiness in life and seeing and realizing very strongly how amazing your life is. Some people are like this others don't actually have the skills to understand why the drug is making them feel so good so they assume it's because it's just the drug itself providing 100% of the effects your feeling. 

But I promise you.... It's really just because it attaches to your opiate receptors and this activation makes you feel very good about the life you already have. If it's a good and happy and positive life, the high will be very strong.

But when you keep doing it let's say daily, first, tolerance goes up because 10mg now is no longer going to provide you the same effects first because the receptors it attached to broke off (not all but receptors lessen in the brain and become less sensitive), another reason is if you still take it to get that feeling you felt the first time, it's never going to happen, because you cannot just appreciate and be grateful for same things everyday. You think you can just stop living life and think you can take opiate daily and appreciate and love life based on what you have and felt a month ago the first time and since then you haven't even thought of doing or changing or improving ans bettering your life in anyway because you can do opiates and feel good....

No it don't work like that. Same thing with eating the most delicious food you've ever ate the  first time or listening to your most amazing song you ever heard first Time and then thinking  you can just eat th same food and listen to the same song every day because it felt so good when you first heard it so who needs something new... And the brain is very good at tricking you into believing that if this is the  best food you've ate in your life and let's say your 23 years old and this song out of tens of thousands of song you heard is the  best one, what are the chances you'll ever eat or listen to any better? So let m just eat and listen to the same thing and hope that this time if I eat a lot more or listen to the song in repeat and try real hard to feel and remember what I felt doing these activities the first time I tried it last month then for sure I can feel the same good feels again from the first time..


But our brains cannot enjoy th same things over and over... Because the receptors in our brain the felt those feelings already broke off and the new receptors arent the same and furthermore they're already coded not to be sensitive to th same exact feeling because if they did alwwys feels the same thing over and over humanity would literally die off. No one would want to do shit because they feel th same amazing high every day.

The  whole point and reason people keep doing it is to feel that same high they felt the first tim  whereas now they only feel a rush and feel good doing it because they know they will avoid the sickness and the body and brain having withdrawals like crazy mostly because its trying to adjust back into reality and the longer you've been addicted the harder th transition will be  because a 10 year heroin addict has essentially been inactive in life for 10 years. And the longer you go the more likely you will never feel the same high again. And opiates by their own don't really feel that good when you feel the physical aspect of it once you've done it so long that when you do even th fatest shot you only feel a physicql rush but have no actual joy in terms of thinkinf life is so good because you've done nothing at all for years have had no new experiences other than probably losing everything you had desperately trying to score another hit. You're life is no longer planning and living your life for a better goal or dream but just thinking day to day only...wake up, get more drugs, so long as I did that and maybe spent an hour two scoring then coming home and shooting I accomplished something today and I'm good and don't have to worry or think about anything because no addict can think about future goals or dreqms because as soon as they do not they realize there's no place fo any drug addiction in life when you Tryibg to become something unless they're thinking about becoming a dealer who uses his stash too.

And of course I'm sure the addicts including myself although I've stopped for a whlle do the drug and hope subconsciously since they forgot long ago why they kept wanting to get more in the first place (to feel the same magical high) and can't stop it because they always think today if I do it I may feel that high and when they don't plus they get sick when they don't do it they can't stop the cycle and really the only effect that is close to what they felt way back when they first try it is just feeling content you have the drug and did it and have it in your system so everything must be good. That's the onky aspect however abstract it is that remains even in a 10 year heroin Injectjng addict to the very first time they did an opiate. Why the drug felt so good th first time that part is gone and forgotten buried in the subconscious and only the abstract emotion of the contentment it brought is weakly there when a 10 year heroin addict shoots up in the morning or day or night ",1534899702.0

——————-

Chapter 3
Taste Profile

During my time working on the original OxyContin project, one of my most brilliant contributions was truly a sublime stroke of absolute genius. 

​​I was, that is to say, we all were completely aware that the market would eventually discover that defeating the time release coating, crushing the contents, and insufflating (sniffing in laymen’s terms) would produce a high unlike anything the world had ever seen. Even the most hardcore heroin addict would be in awe of OxyContin’s euphoric flood and endless “legs”. Opiate naive individuals and opiate-tolerant addicts alike would bow to the clean, long lasting, serotonin tsunami that OxyContin would produce. With this foreknowledge, it occurred to me as I was letting an ibuprofen tablet dissolve under my tongue one evening in the lab when I sensed a vicious headache threatening to disrupt my work, that ibuprofen was sweet. The manufacturer had added a sweetener to the formulation. Not because sucrose would aid the action of the ibuprofen. No, they made the tablet taste sweet because they knew people like me would dissolve the medication under their tongue and find the taste pleasant. These chemicals do not taste pleasant on their own. In fact, they mostly taste so bad that we would do anything to avoid tasting them completely, if we had to do so. Anytime a pharmaceutical compound has a taste, especially one that is pleasing to the palette, it is by design. 

​​With that, I designed what eventually became OxyContin’s “taste profile”. Ask anyone who ever chewed an OxyContin pill, or crushed and insufflated one, and they will all tell you the same thing: it had a unique and pleasurable flavor, even when dripping down the back of ones throat from the sinus cavities it had been forcefully inhaled into. 

​​
​​That was me.
​​

​​One may wonder: “Why would a time released medication, a tablet designed not to have a taste at all, need a taste profile?” This is a fair question. The time release coating had no flavor profile, it was by design taste-negative. Only after defeating the time release coating and either chewing or insufflating the the powder inside the tablet, would one know the sweet nondescript flavor that is OxyContin. 
​​One may further wonder “Why would the drug manufacturer put any thought into the taste of the compound when the only way to experience said taste was by defeating the time-release coating, an act the manufacturer would never condone, an act the manufacturer indeed would warn against performing?”
​​

​​Let the record show this much: we always knew what people would eventually discover about our product; the ways it could be used and the ways it would be used. We considered all possibilities, we always do. We leave no possibility unaddressed, no stone unturned. This is our art and our craft; we are the gods of the world Huxley imagined: better living through chemistry.

​​
​​Maybe, if I’m feeling generous before I reach the end of this dispatch, I’ll share the “recipe” for the OxyContin flavor profile and those of you with a desire to do so can “taste” the flavor of a lost generation. We will see how charitable I am feeling when I reach the end.",1534876854.0

I have no idea why, but I write best in opiate withdrawals. I've been taking stabs at it with booze and sleep deprivation lately.. and here's something I came up with, not to be taken as fact.


'Look, honey, you can do whatever you want. Ultimately it's your choice. You don't have to and can't possibly justify it to me.""


""It's always been my choice.""


""And it will be again tomorrow. Remember that. So why even call?""


""Cause I... need you to know I love you. In case I don't get another choice tomorrow... Tell my family I said ""Good evening,"" anything else would just be too awkward fr them.""


""Oh fuck you. Love you too. Be safe. Please? Come back.""


My head is a swimming pool of kitty litter stuck on stupid. The xanax-gravity glob of impulsive randomness has long since settled in. I need this. It's me. Always was.. I was a a liar trying to run. She's cominh home. No. *I'm* going home. Yep.


I mix up what I'm guessing is a few points of crystal in my spoon with almost enough water. i can feel the anticipation buzzing up my legs., into my knees. Suddenly I'm bouncing my leg as I try and pull thick toxic goo into my rig. Naturally, it doesn't work at all, but it keeps my mind busy as I try not to think too hard and jinx my homecoming tonight.


**Over two but less than six hours later** 


My cupboards are bare, the fridge is halfway there. My neighbors will be lighting incense in the morning, because I won't even remember buying or smoking enough weed to last me two months. I'm fixing to go buy some beer from a long closed liquor store when my text comes through. 


""I'm here. So you actually wanna hook up or just another straight white dude invading my space for drugs?"" 


""Ha. fair question. I'm not gay though, or straight. I'm a hedonist. You'll see what I mean. But - even if I was straight I'd still blow ya if you really found that for me.""


""Yeah, my boyfriend says it's good. I'm on my way in. Never met a real live hedonist before. I have so many questions."" 


A short, petite native guy comes around the corner and stops dead in his tracks and turns to looks at me. 


""Not saying I'm nice, cause I took a few xanax. But I'm not dangerous.. Your call though.""


He smiles and walks up the steps, and next thing I know we're inside my living room.


""Be careful with this shit, okay man? It's not safe these days. I don't even know the fuck why you want it if you don't do it anymore.""


""I'm dumb as fuck. What's to argue?""


""You white boys are dumb as fuck sometimes. Why you guys love heroin so much?""


""Why you native kids like firewater?"" 


'Ha, fuck you man. That shit's your fault."" 


""Only directly. So that's a 30? huh? You weigh it?"" 


""No, but he owes me 30 bucks and he pissed me off so it's yours for 30. I don't have any more but that's worth at least 30.""


""Well that's more like $300. No joke. So he's gonna be pissed.""


""Shit, take it man. I still want that blowjob though."" 


""Ha, if it's real we'll talk about what this costs. You even old enough fo a blow job? You got any ID? I'm not even sure yo'u're 18. Creeps me out to be honest. Some fucked up kinda sting you goy going on here.""


""I'm 24 dick, I can prove it. And I think most cops would have beat the shit out of you by now.""


I mix my shot up in silence, he watches me and asks me where I get my rigs. It turns out, he's pretty familiar with my ritual himself. I give him a little dust to mix up with his next shot of clear, and by the time we're tied off and ready he's learned I'm a chef at a restaraunt downtown and he just graduated business school in the spring and is kinda.. living about as hard as a seasoned drug addict on a xanax driven two year clean celebration bender.


After our respective shots I wake up to him slapping my cheeks.


""White boy, i'm callin' 911. and takin your wallet if you pass out again.""


""Fuck off if you're gonna try to be my girlfriend. I don't need the drama take the wallet and go. Better leave the fuckin' smack though or run far, far away.""


A bright idea pops into my head, and without even opening his eyes it only takes a minute before I have his hard cock sliding down the back of my throat. I want him to feel as great as I do. He probably never should and hope he never truly will, though. This is scratching that itch of longing after pretending it wasn't real for years. Like a dog with fleas that itch is scratched, and I fade in and out of consciousness as I do my best to show him how carnally grateful I am for being such a cute delivery boy capable of keeping up with my bullshit.


A few hours later I wake up on my couch, and he's laying beside me in a light snuggle. I put my arm around him and pull him closer to me and thank him fo
r the bliss. 


""Your're really good at sucking cock, white boy."" 


""Don't call me that, native kid. And I'm good at it cause i like doing it. Especially when I get drugs for it.""


""Ha! So you're a prostitute now?"" 


""Sure. why not? You pay pretty well. You know your boyfriend is waking up about 250 dollars light tomorrow right? I'll give you cash to give him, and I promise he'll still be pissed.""


""No fuck him. He's a dick. It's really hard to find that stuff these days. I don't need to make it easier for him""


""Ha, ok man, just let me know when he flips shit, ok? I don't like being this guy. But it's really, really fucking good. So he's not getting it back.""


""I don't care he's a dick shut up and suck my dick again white boy. Ha!"" 


""Pay up anytime. native kid. You're a bottle of silver wolf away from gettin rolled before a night in jail. Remember that.""


""Oh fuck you white boy. Wanna see me drunk?""



""Maybe some day. On a date. Before a blowjob, like regular people.""


""Ha. Shit. Are you serious? Thought you'd just be my ""Sugar daddy"" 


""That daddy shit's creepy. And you're already past your prime for that. Gotta pull your own weight in  those bags under your eyes. Or marry rich."" 


""I don't think fags should get married. We're all fucking insane.""


""The world is really. You're not special. That's the point. And don't say that word."" 


""It's our word. I can use it.""


""It's not my word. It's a word I heard a few times while getting my ass kicked.. until I learned to fight. And I'm not even gay. So, at least in my house, just a lil respect please? I grew up in a different time. I got harassed for having a gay friend. Before I was even a full fledged faggot..""


""Okay, I get it. That's like some middle school shit anyway, get over it""


""It was after graduating high school man. But, it drove me out of here into the civilized world. Though I see it's been tamed quite a bit back here now, too."" 


""Not on the reservation. I'm like.. not a man? Like, less than a man. And always will be.""


""You get your dick sucked whenever you want by a white dude. What's manlier than two men with dicks?"" I tell him as I unzip his pants again.


Now it's about 8 or 9AM Sunday morning, and the light is coming through the windows and I'm sitting naked and clean on a towel I laid on the couch trying to text a number but I keep thinking the words ""Two years>..."" and fading out a little more... I hear my phone drop.


""Wake up. You can't die high on Sunday morning, you're supposed to be in church. ""


""Fuck your god kid."" 


""He's not my god. He's yours.""


""Sure as shit isn't mine, You're the one spreading the gospel here. Go to church. I'm gonna get high and die and everything stops forever. I'll know peace, you'll know false hope. Luck.""


""Jesus fuck dude. Quit being so god damn melodramatic. Can I get a little more smack? Let's put down on speedballs."" 


""Goofballs. Speed balls are coke. No one know why but t's final. And I'm out of brown."" 


""YOU DID IT ALL?""


""Want your money yet?"" 


""Dude I thought it was really good, and way more than I thought..>""


""It was. Doesn't make it last much longer."" 


""How the fuck are you not dead.. are you trying to kill yourself?""


""Specifically now? No. I wanted to enjoy the smack. And I did. I'll probably go out in a car wreck. Or ground up alive n a meat grinder during an elementary school field trip to see how laws and sausages are made. Except nobody gives a fuck about where their food comes from anymore. Don't let me get into the legislative branch kid. I don't even give.....""

 
I open my eyes, and he's standing at the end of the couch with his coat and shoes on, and my wallet in his hand smiling at me. He tosses it onto my chest and sits on the arm.


""I can't even rob you man. You're fucking pathetic from wallowing in pseudo-intellectual self pity all day. Aren't you going to count your money?"" 


""I don't fucking care. I've been working about every waking hour this summer at my first head chef gig. All I have is money, and I don't fucking care about money anymore, It's the real killer anyway. It's only ever made me miserable one way or another. I live a very simple life to account for my hatred of money. You need some money? My house is a socialist paradise, really. We welcome business majors. Go ahead and enjoy the spoils of Marx.


""Well you can give it to me if you h so much Or you could buy more panties to keep around for all those badass bitches you must have over all the time. Are you trans?""


""Thought you liked my blowjobs? And you're gay, so I must be a man.""


Next thing I know he's got both of his frail little arms wrapped around one of my arms as he tries to hold me up and steer me forward and I instinctively follow.


""What are we trackin? Shit are we on the trail of tears?"" 


""I really thought you actually knew where we were going. Fuck you, too. You're two blocks from your house.. You drug me 
here. I'm bout ready to leave your racist ass in the gutter so you can hate yourself even more.""


""Oh! Jack. Fuck yeah kid, let's go get some weed. And a cup of coffee. And share some of this smack with him.""


""You did it all. See the puke down your shirt? Are we visiting him at the church? Cause that congregation might have to deal with this shit so I hope he's in it""


""He lives in that grey house across the street. Fuck them, those Pentecostal heretics will get theirs in hell. Hey, that's him on the steps with his head in his hands. Think he's waiting for us. And I can't be racist because my grandpa was half native, which makes me only part white. Now who's racist?"" 


**Some later point inside Jack's**


""So you're gay now?""


""Nope, sorry."" 


""Oh right, gay guys have more sense than to show up at mt my house covered in puke and waving to decent society attending church accross the street. But I suppose they might have called them all heretics. What the fuck are you on and why the fuck are you doing this to me?""


""I'm gay? At least, for smack. Like any decent person!""


""You got smack? Seriously? holy fuck""


""""No he did it all cause it was to much and really good it seems.""


""Wait... is he really a prostitute""


""Haha he's your friend, I just met him. He's fuckin crazy.""


""Yeah, I've never seen him get anything like this. He barely even smokes weed.""


More coming, this story's just getting started.  If you don't iike the gay shit you oughta try it next time you do xanax and black out because it's in your sub conscience now. Only way to get it out is to go read some Burroughs and sexually harass women in a bar.

994ryk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/994ryk/how_can_i_help_my_girlfriend_with_the_withdrawal/,8,https://redd.it/994ryk,FishOdour,How can I help my girlfriend with the withdrawal of kratom and kolonopin?,"So, my girlfriend and I have four days we’ve each taken off work. We took these days a few months ago with intent to go camping, but she mentioned an idea that popped in her head yesterday. 

She mentioned maybe taking those four days and getting a motel or long stay, and and staying there while she deals with the withdrawal effects of cutting kratom and kpins out. She has a history with heroin and uses kratom to ease the urges to use. She’s been taking kolonopin for her anxiety, but realizes it’s not a good long term solution and wants to get off them. 

She lives with her family so doesn’t want to deal with this at home, and it’ll be easier if she’s not working. I said I’d be happy to stay with her and take care of her during. What can I expect? What can I do to make this easier on her and I? 

I’m not too familiar with this situation. I know it’ll be ugly, so she says, and it’ll be rough on her. I’ve dabbled, with her, in using but I’ve never fallen into addiction and haven’t experienced withdrawal firsthand. I did witness my dad go through bad oxy addiction and withdrawal, but I was young and didn’t really understand it at the time. ",1534869935.0

(Snowball) Have you ever...?,"Hi guys, so this just happened: I, being fairly new to them, had just done one almighty knee-trembler of a snowball for myself (do you call them snowballs or speedballs in America?) and a friend who has been a user for nearly 20 years with nary a vein remaining on her body was trying to bang her own. 
  
I saw her struggling and knew it must be congealed now so even if she got a vein, the elixir wouldn't pass through the eye of the needle. Crack tends to resolidify after standing around for a while, and actually I had no idea about that until a few nights ago. Which is kind of strange since on one particular day preceding that night, I fixed up four separate rig-fulls of delicious, frightening snowball and had no issues with them getting hard while they waited to be picked next to enter my circulatory system. *(What's up with that?!)* 

  
So, back to the present day: I tried various methods of heating the liquid up to simply just get it out of the pin, but to no avail, so with a heavy heart, we threw it in the bin. She's not dependant luckily as she's on subs, otherwise we'd still be fighting to make it IV-ready probably. It was the last of our gear though so party's over for the night!  
  
I did a few Google searches on the subject, finding only 2 relevant questions asked on Quora where the OP was questioning the safety and feasibility of banging a 2-week old coagulated shot of meth!  
One person, amongst his likely meth-fuelled words, came teasingly close to answering what I want to know: he said if you don't know how to get that thickened blood out of a syringe, you should reconsider your ability to IV and stick to other ROA's. 
  
So yeah, how the heck could I have gotten that shit out of there? My plan was then to heat it until it thinned enough to draw back up to have another attempt.  
  
I wanna hear the stories you guys have regarding times your shots thickened until you couldn't use 'em, and what you've done or seen others do to salvage that precious medicine.  
  
Thanks guys.

993ssc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/993ssc/just_discovered_my_mother_has_been_steeling_my/,29,https://redd.it/993ssc,Myfamikysucksass,Just discovered my mother has been steeling my dad's pain meds,"So this is a throwaway because of obvious reasons. If you look in the post history of this account you'll see a detailed post about what's been happening in my family lately, but this post is about something different. My dad has had a bad back, been in severe pain, and been taking (a lot of) pain medication for about 7 years. He always hated the way opiates make him feel, so he usually takes less than he's prescribed, meaning he has extra. About 8 months he started having the issue of being low in his meds, sometimes even out, at the end of some months. Occasionally he would give someone in the family one for various things, but it was never anywhere near enough for him to have this problem. 

Me, being the 21 year old kid the finger was always pointed directly at me. He's occasionally given me his medication for a condition I have, but the second he started having these problems I stopped accepting them from him. My brother has been given them on occasion and complained about the way they make him feel. My mom asks my dad for them pretty frequently, for headaches, when she's sore, when she falls down (which happens pretty frequently), basically she's been asking my dad for his pills at least once a week for a few years now. 

Eventually I moved out (fairly recently), but still visited my parents pretty often, and because the pills still went missing, that finger was still pointed at me. I use some recreational drugs, occasionally even opiates, but my dad has been my best friend my whole life, I can't even bring myself to accept his meds when they're offered to me for my pain because I know it'll throw off his entire life by one dose, let alone steal them and force him to be in incredible pain. Yet, my dad still slightly suspected me, and my mom was sure she knew it was me. Arguments would ensue and she would yell at me, accusing of taking them. 

Fast forward to about a month ago. I'm not gonna go into too much detail as this is a very sensitive topic and I made a post in /r/dysfunctionalfamilies that goes into great detail about these events. My father tried to commit suicide. The only reason he didn't succeed is because my mom called my fiance and I to check on him, we managed to make it there in time to stop him from taking any more pills and call 911. Before the police/EMTs arrived he kept talking about my mom cheating on him. We thought it was just due to the large amount of meds he had just took, but we later discovered he was right. 

She had been cheating for awhile. Last night my dad texted me to tell me my mother told him that she wished he had succeeded and was dead so she could claim his life insurance policy. Immediately my fiance and I grabbed everything we'd need for a potential overnight stay (medications, phone charger, clothes, etc) hurried down there, a drive that usually takes 30 minutes took me more like 13. After a long talk with both parents (not important to this story, again details in other post) we decided to just try to sit with my dad and help him relax (mom had to sleep for worktn the next day). At one point I took one of my medications out of my bag to take it but I dropped it. I was sitting where my mom always sits and the bottle landed in her purse. I reached to grab it but I grabbed the wrong bottle. I realized this bottle had my dad's name on it. 

It was dated 4/2018, and it was MS Contin. Still giving her the benefit of the doubt I opened it up and looked at the pills inside, they were indeed the same 30mg morphine my dad takes....24 of them. Now I know she didn't take these all at once, this is just her stash, but that means my mom had been taking these pills from my dad since April. My fiance saw me with a pill bottle in my hand, assuming it was mine or hers, and put it in her purse. I don't really have much of a question here. I know I'm going to tell my dad, I know I'm going to confront my mom, I'm just pissed. 

I know opiates can make decent people do crazy things, but this is beyond crazy. My own mother was stealing pain meds from my dad, presumably to get high (she has previously and still does have an alcohol problem) and was constantly blaming me and screaming at me over it. I'm just having a lot of trouble handling everything. Sorry I guess this post doesn't really have a purpose.",1534863116.0

I seriously think my brain is more addicted to oxy like everytime I do 30s I withdrawal my face off.  When I do dope (which is rare) the withdrawal doesn’t seem as bad.  Why is this ?  Maybe because my brain doesn’t recognize it as much as 30s bc it acts a bit differently on the receptors...not sure but anyway.  My plan was to stop taking subs which is really tough the first 14 days so maybe try to let an 8th of H last that long and then transition to kratom?  Or something .. and then transition to completely clean.  I’m aware it probably won’t work and it’s probably going to be an excuse to get high when it’s all said and done but MAYBE not !  Has anyone done this ?  Success stories ?  Frustrating failure stories ?  Other unorthodox ways to come off sub ?  What do ya got for me ppl.  


Update it’s August 27th:  I’ve been on kratom for 2 days ... only did H for 7 or 8 days because my connect screwed me (which I expected). I am taking opms gold kratom and it’s crazy.  This wasn’t the greatest idea I think it was an excuse to do some bomb ass H really because now even 3 pills of OPM and my skin is still crawling if anyone knows OPM gold capsules they are pretty much the strongest kratom on the market in my opinion.  They are also the most expensive.  I spent 150 dollars on 15 pills at my local kratom cbd store.  Not cool.   Part of me wants to get back on my sub but I feel like I have to punish myself for what I did.  Hopefully I stay on kratom and transfer to the cheap shit and take less than 7 grams total per day (which you still withdrawal on lol).  It’s not as bad in my experience though and it’s like when you want to quit your opportunity is there and possible unlike sub where it feels like you are locked in.",1534832416.0

We chased the tourists away with our body odor and grease caked pores, blowing hits of weed at their kids. We badmouthed the owners for selling out and never bought more than a cup of black coffee with refills.

So, Travis came to find me, except he wasn’t really looking for me. He needed a ride for his uncle, but we both knew he didn’t have an uncle.

“Sure, I have to be back to work at Ogelvies for four.”

“Cool. He’s back at Geoff’s. We have to get something out of his car.”

Minutes later my blue S 10 idled in the shade of Geoff’s gravel driveway. It was my beautiful blue truck until I forgot to put antifreeze in the radiator, then it was an immovable eyesore that the grass grew around in the front yard of Cheo’s house on Montoya. The death of that truck marked the death of my 8-month stint of sobriety. Well 8 months is what I told my parents and Cheo. It was more like 4 months, and I was smoking meth the whole time.

“Bob’s 73 years old and from Woodstock. He showed up earlier this week and flipped his car down a ravine 2 nights ago. The highway patrol said he flipped it at least six times and walked back up himself. A real miracle. He had to throw his stash and scale before he could walk back up.” I pretended not to notice that Bob was not his uncle at 73 years old. “We just have to help him get something out of his car, in Questa.”

Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk. He had an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door, swinging and creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.

“F***ing imbeciles! I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse s***!” Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

“I know. I know. I talked to Geoff about it. He said he didn’t know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don’t believe it, though.”

Some drama I wasn’t privy to, but I found out later that his dog was missing. It was one of two times that Geoff and Christine had stolen and traded the old man’s pure bread Pekinese to Edward for coke, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his baldhead to the stained waistband of his shorts, and he sweat. His shirt was always off, and his health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

Once after Eddie moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas into a milk jug with the silver dollars. His neighbors saw us do it, but Taos is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man’s dog got eaten by coyotes, in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.

“Bob, this is Riley. Riley, this is Bob.”

“The Indomitable Buffalo, they can’t keep me down! Buffalo Bob Cass! Pleased to meet you!” His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band, Rick Danko. He even stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn’t stand Buffalo though. He thought he was a piece of garbage.

We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Bob coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in can of soup, probably from the wreck. Travis looked at me horrified. Bob acted like he didn’t hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to Taos, he stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow he lost his U haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of 5th gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory opened up and summoned my imagination. They said Taos was still the wild, wild west, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up towards Colorado.

Funny how people are when they ask you for something, especially junkies. Bob wasn’t Travis’ uncle. He made it sound like his car was down the street or in Ranchos worst-case scenario but not 20 miles away in a different town. There was almost no way I’d be back by four. Travis nor Bob had any clue where his car was, not a number to call, not the name of a junkyard, nothing. It may not have even been in Questa, and I bet anything that whatever they wanted out of the car wasn’t in it anyway. But that’s how it goes for a junkie in Taos.

At a gas station we pondered what to do. Bob didn’t have any ideas. Travis was busy smoking heroin in the bathroom, and there are untold junkyards in Questa. Bob and I sat in the truck and smoked cigarettes waiting for Travis.

“Why don’t you go in and see what’s taking him?” It had been over 20 minutes, and when I walked into the gas station Travis was on an office chair behind the counter. His face was green and body doubled over. He held his gut with his hands.

Before I got back out the door an ambulance pulled up. They loaded him onto the gurney and into the back. It was a bad case of gas as far as I could tell from his diet of pure sugar and the irregular bowel movements of an opiate addict. A gloved hand grabbed a tube of lubricant and a rubber tube in the window, before they pulled away. I shook my head and walked back to the S10.

“Well? What the hell is taking so long?”

“Ambulance came and took him. He looked like his gut was in a knot.”

“Ambulance? Really?” The truck was 15 feet away while they loaded Travis into the back, but somehow Bob had missed it. “Are you sure? I guess he won’t be coming back with us then.”

“No. No, he won’t. Probably what he ate gave him a stomach ache.”

“What did he have?”

“A giant moon pie and a bunch of orange soda.”

“Well, no s\*\*\*! What did he think was going to happen? Eating like that! F\*\*\*ing imbecile!”

Bob got silent and turned away as if he forgot what he said. He looked out of the passenger window, pensive and still, pondering some deep truth about life. Dark clouds gathered over the horizon, and the aura of heroin and his tiny pupils were peaceful, quiet for a moment. His long grey hair barely touched the collar of his leather coat. It was proof of the wisdom only 73 years of life can give.

The crinkle of cellophane broke the silence in the truck. He pushed it back before his dentures ripped a chunk of moon pie into his mouth. The gold handle of his cane rested on a 64-ounce fountain drink between his legs.

“F\*\*\*ing imbeciles, I tell ya! I’ve never seen anything like it in all my life. Well, let’s get going.”

I started writing about Bob as soon as he moved in. My plans were for a book. The first line went,

“The heartache. The headache. The stink of watery, green feces sprayed on the walls and puddled on my landlord’s carpet.” The carpet was new when I moved in. Brand new, and Bob ruined it. On top of my plans for a book about Bob, I had dreams of being a poet at that time of my life. It took me years to realize that I hated poetry.

He began to detox in a bad way, the beginning of a dramatic and obscenity-laden affair of about two months. He kept a welcome mat on the floor next to his bed, and I picked it up out of curiosity one day. Underneath were at least nine cigarette burns where the cigarettes had burned from end to end on the carpet, but the mat was also completely caked with green poop. Between the toilet and his bed, the green trail proved he was not well. There was at least one spray of lime green on the wall by the door.

Bob was a self-proclaimed junkie through and through. He knew it. He told so many stories of all the dope he had done and where he did it and how good it was and who he did it with. Those days were gone though, and 73 is not so kind to a junkie.

We were all dying like him. It was only more obvious that he was on his way out. Dead men and dead women walking, we looked for life in death, because staring death in the face was the only time we felt alive. Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else. None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended that this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery. Bob needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it. I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie’s one morning. When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit. But, he sat in his bed smoking a cigarette.

“How’d you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?”

“They kicked me out.”

“They kicked you out? Why?”

“Too much trouble. They said they weren’t prepared for me. Too much s***ing. Too much runny nose. Said they didn’t expect me to be s***ing all over the place like that.”

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot. It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

“Come on, you f***ing b***!” He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder. He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.

I slept with a few different girls while I lived at that place, one named Luanne. Some people tell you they are bipolar, and others you find vacuuming your living room at 4 a.m., dancing to dubstep and smoking a bowl of weed but you know that they don’t do meth. Luanne was that kind of bipolar, and she spent the night with me sometimes. We were good friends.

I saw another girl who panhandled change in the parking lots during the days and had my mother’s name. She was beautiful in a weathered kind of way like some old momma you find at the pound, worn and scarred by the world but beautiful because of it. Bob called all my women by the same name: that f\*\*\*ing whore.

Anytime we went somewhere he would tell strangers of the abuse he suffered at my house. It was humiliating and largely untrue, but one hipster kid bought Bob’s line and sneered at me for my inhumanity. He would take Bob to his house in Tres Piedras and care for the old man as any decent human would. The guy made a big show of how altruistic (one of Bob’s favorite words) he was and what a disgrace I was. Travis and I laughed so hard that we had to put our hands on our knees to keep from falling on our faces.  
The next morning, I found them in the hipster’s Nissan in the parking lot behind Tazza. Bob sat in the passenger seat with an unlit Native 100 between his lips and acted excited to see me, too excited, like he needed something, like things weren’t working out with the hipster. “Hey, Riley! I’m so happy to see you!” “Hmm…. Are you now, Bob?” “Oh yeah! Extremely.” He turned to the hipster in the driver’s seat. “Hey, you, where in the f\*\*\* is my phone?” “I don’t know where in the f\*\*\* your phone is! It’s your phone! Why don’t you keep track of it?” I agreed with the kid. It wasn’t his responsibility, and they yelled some more before the old man came back to my place.

Bob got healthier while he lived with me, and my heroin habit grew. He put on weight and got his bodily functions under control for the most part. After two months it was time for him to leave, and he had a place rented in El Prado. I packed his stuff into the back of my truck, and for some reason he called me a, “F***ing piece of s***! You know that? A real piece of s\*\*\*!”

After all I did for him I had it. I had only ever touched him with care and concern. All the times he went to the hospital, I visited him. When he came back from a CT scan, I patted his head and held his hand. At night before he slept, I washed and rubbed those two petrified pieces of mahogany he called feet and lathered them with tiger balm, but now I had him by the collar and my fist cocked back behind my head and bit my lip. “Oh what? You’re gonna hit a sick old man are you? Bet you feel real tough! Don’t you boy? You’re real tough now!” I threw his boots into the back of my truck and took him to his new place. My back tires sprayed him with muddy snow and gravel when I tore out of his driveway.

After he moved out, my manager at Ogelvie’s, Tiffany asked me about him.

“He said, he thought he was bothering you a little bit or something.”

“A little bit?” We both laughed.

He had been in on a Saturday afternoon to watch his Iowa football team play Ohio. Tiffany said he kept walking around the place “grabbing himself.” She called me to come watch him, and in case things got crazy I could take him away.

Ogelvie’s fired me for acting goofy when I came out of the bathroom and wearing sunglasses to wash dishes and the weird film that collected in the corners of my mouth and for obnoxiously ranting at customers. A week after that I defaulted on the rent at my place. When my landlord came to see me, we talked for 30 minutes in the cold next to the shattered front window while addicts lurked around inside. He was nice about telling me I had to go, but when he left I found a loaded syringe behind my ear. The weather had already cracked the engine block in my S10.

Before I moved out Bob called me to tell me he broke his hip and that he was staying in the old folks’ home by the hospital. We hadn’t talked since the day I almost punched him, so I went to visit him.

“Yah! Fell on the ice on the road up to my house coming back from the movie store.”

“What did you rent?”

“I don’t know! Some s\*\*\* flick about a hit man. Whatever it was, it wasn’t worth shattering my hip. That was it, though, when I fell. I couldn’t do anything, and it was getting dark. The neighbors drove around me and up to the house to watch the news! Can you believe that s\*\*\*? Drove right around me lying on the ground! I could have died!”

I smiled. It seemed hard to believe, but unbelievably bad things always happened to him. Now he graced the nursing staff of the geriatric ward with his red faced, foul mouthed, screaming accusations. More than once, they caught him rolling around in his wheel chair smoking weed in the hallways, while he pretended that the pictures on the wall were fine art. When he didn’t get what he wanted from the staff, he messed himself and rolled up to the nurse’s station and demanded that they take care of it.

“Well, I’m glad you’re not dead, Bob. I missed you.”

“Missed you, too, Riley. Missed you too. How’s that piece of s\*\*\*? What’s his name? Timmy? Can’t stand that mother f\*\*\*er. When is he going to get where he can take care of himself? I mean. He’s only 38.”

“I don’t know.” He was referring to my buddy who had been living at my house since before Bob came around. “I don’t know where he’s going to go. I don’t know where I’ll go for that matter.”

“What do you mean? Are you getting thrown out?”

“Yeah. I decided to buy some coke last month while the rent money was in my pocket. You know how it goes.”

“Yeah. Yeah, I do. Haha. F\*\*\*ed yourself didn’t you?” He showed his dentures with a smile.

“Yup.”

“Well, I won’t be home for a while. At least another month. You can stay there and help me out when I get back home.”

“Awesome! Thank you!”

“Just one thing, Riley.”

“Yeah? What’s that?”

“Leave Tim wherever the f\*\*\* you found him in the first place. The last thing I need or want is his sorry a\*\* at my place. Lousy piece of s\*\*\*.”

I moved into his house a few days after Thad stabbed me in the face with an umbrella over a handful of Xanax that I stole from my friend’s leukemic landlord. Despite all that I had going against me in terms of reputation and appearance in town, the black scabs on my face embarrassed me, because they made me look less than sophisticated. Looking sophisticated was the least of my worries, and while Bob was in the hospital, my new friend Johnny and I tied my mattress to the hood of his car to move me and Tim and Tim’s dog into Bob’s new place.

Johnny and I used to tear through Taos in his white Lincoln Town Car with two other kids while I projectile vomited out of the passenger window. Both of those kids are dead now. One jumped from a cliff escaping imaginary and malevolent figures. The other overdosed and got left in his car at the ER one night. They found him dead in the morning.

Other times Johnny and I hung out with an older nurse who hated me until we shot cocaine together. Then she stripped down and danced and sang for me while Johnny and I laughed at her. She never noticed that I wasn’t into it, but that didn’t matter. She was into herself.

It was common to watch her mix way too much cocaine with way too much heroine in the same shot, and ten minutes later she bragged about how she only ate granola because Fruity Pebbles were so unhealthy. She told us about a house she had in Ranchos that was haunted with a patch of red paint that bled through multiple new coats over several years. Eventually she had a dream in which all the details were disclosed about a 19th century abortion involving a teenage girl and a priest in that bedroom. I tried to contact her about the story, but she’s dead too.

Bob ran Tim and his dog off as soon as he got home from the hospital and fell in a pile of his own feces soon after that. He had gotten mad at me about not giving some syringes to Johnny in an episode of dementia and yelled for help all night long after he fell. I let him sit in it until the morning, even though I couldn’t sleep for his yelling. It was how heinous I had become. He struggled to breathe for several days before we took him to the hospital, and it turned out that one of four broken ribs had punctured his lung. He snuck his IV out of the hospital when they released him, but when he pulled it out at the house his blood was black saw dust.

Sometimes I had fits of furious passion in my bedroom and banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun. Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon. Then there was no point in writing. Sometimes I wouldn’t even get out of bed and chose instead to watch the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn’t take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out. Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Bob caused me.

I forgot that I even had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn’t have told you about him anyway. My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading. Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn’t make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human. Let me tell you about my dog. He was a good dog.

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in the KTAO parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a Taos Cattle Dog. We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star. It fit well, and he understood me perfectly. He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night. He could sit, stay, lay down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do. He never went to the bathroom in the house, except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed. It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.

When I moved from my old place to Bob’s, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left him outside of Smith’s grocery store. It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith’s was the only thing I found. Serio showed up at Bob’s the next morning, even though he had never been there. It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.

Now, I can’t remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me. Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about. My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it, but I was too depressed to move. The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again. Serio was taken from me by another local drug addict, who was better than I was. He accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later. Such was my life and everything that I touched.

“Everything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do, is everything you want to do!” He laughed with his dentures out like he was channeling my old friend Bobo. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Buffalo Bob Cass and made crowds swoon. Every time he died and went to heaven some “Abe Lincoln looking m\*\*\*\*\* f\*\*\*er” sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn’t come in the back door.

Once, he woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in Woodstock told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives. These were the stories that he told.

One day he watched Yolanda, Garth the dope whisperer’s girlfriend, open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed that he was gone, but he watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Bob slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was Taos when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn’t work out for them. He sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took 300 dollars out of his account and never came back. The year’s last snow had still not melted.

When I was homeless the next summer I would end up at that desert oasis in Ranchos called Taco Bell. Inside I would stare at the walls painted purple and red to make it look less cheap and listen to the soft jazz. The dropouts working the counter understood the plight of life in Taos and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup. I pondered life and what could have been and what was not. Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town. Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over chlorinated pool at the hotel. I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late August. Back to school commercials offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils on the hotel TVs. Anxiety put knots in my stomach when they played, and I could feel it all, like I was there, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the 6th grade. Then, I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson’s parking lot looking for a fix.

The last time Bob and I spent time together was right when he got out of the hospital again, a year later. We had not talked for a long time, but I knew where he lived, and I knew he was in the hospital, so I moved in. I was renting the front room out to Johnny and his junkie girlfriend who drooled on herself and always had 4 or 5 spoons on the kitchen counter with streaks of soot and the scattered pink crumbs of pills she called fast 5s. One of her eyelids always stuck halfway shut, and she paused several seconds between every word. They didn’t look very fast, but who was I to judge.

Bob was happy to see me anyway. That was the life of a junkie, even at 75. You go to the hospital. You get out. Junkies are living in your house, and the party goes on. My girlfriend, Danielle, put the light bill in her name, because Bob owed money to the company, and he asked us to. But when he made us mad one day I threw a big box TV at his feet and busted the white powder all over his floor. Danielle and I went and turned the power off on the old man in the middle of winter to collect the deposit. It was the last time that I ever saw him, but not the last I heard.

A year later, he called me from Miami where I suppose he died. Years later in the foyer of a church, a woman asked me if I had a grandfather who passed.

“He wants to tell you hello.”

“You mean you talk to dead people?”

“My friends are passed over.” She said, as if calling them dead was politically incorrect.

“Oh, well, I didn’t know my grandfather. I don’t know who it could be.”

She struggled to get the deceased’s name, but could not come up with it.

“I’ll let you know if he tells me his name. He says he loves you. He says you went through a lot together, and that you were in a bad way. He said he is proud of you, for doing so well. Very proud.”

She walked back over to her table, and I forgot about her. My girlfriend and I talked at our table. She said she thought contact with the dead was evil. I had my own opinions of how that worked and explained. The lady stood up suddenly and screamed,

“BOB!!!!! He says his name is Bob!!!!!! He loves you and, he is so, so proud of you!”",1534821638.0

It was just hydrocodone. I was a kid. A stupid fucking kid. It's no excuse. But where in D.A.R.E. did they teach us to worry about the pills the doctor gives you? My class missed that chapter in the 4th grade. But I threw it up when I got my wisdom teeth pulled, so I threw them in a drawer. A car accident at 18 and more pills.... more of the same thing I threw up before. So into the drawer they went.   


I was about to turn 21. My friends were all coming for a bonfire. We were going to have drinks and then go out in a bus. My mom was baking brownies for my friends. She asked for my help and thought I was fuckin' with her and didn't feel like helping... ""Little ungrateful bitch"", I hear as I climbed the steps because my stomach hurt so bad. Not my stomach, lower, my ovaries actually, but I didn't know that yet. I crawled down the stairs in tears an hour later, my mom apologizing and rushing me to the hospital. 

  
The doctors ran their tests, promising me pain relief ""just after one more test"". This was after 3 or 4 but whatever, they're the doctors, not me. Finally an internal ultrasound, which was basically a dildo with a camera on it, poking the SHIT out of my ovaries. I cried and cried but at least they found what they were looking for. Finally, because they found the source of the pain, a cluster of ovarian cysts, two of them being baseball sized and already rupturing cysts, I could get some relief.   


Now this is where the funniest and also worst joke of my life comes into play. My mom tells the nurse who is hooking up the morphine to my IV. ""She was supposed to celebrate her 21st tonight with friends"" she tells the nurse. The nurse looks over at me, still doing her job, ""Happy Birthday, hun"". My mom continues ""We had to call off everything, but I guess now instead of saying she had her first legal drink on her 21st, she had her first shot of morphine.""  I didn't laugh. The nurse didn't laugh. My dad chuckled a bit. I probably would have if I could have, but the pain was too much. I would have laughed too, fuck it. They monitored me overnight, when the pain stopped, they sent me home with a few scripts. ""You still have two golf ball sized cysts there... speak with your family physician, they'll get you on hormones to get to those other cysts before they rupture, but come back in a month so we can be sure they've negated in size rather than the latter.""   


My dad said he watched the whole time. My dad is inherently good. Wonderful. He had ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" on my shit hospital TV, he said he hurt, watching me literally writhe in pain, he'd never seen that before in all his years, he was 55 or so at the time. But he said he watched, he watched the morphine drip in with the water... he watched the TV but paid more attention to my movements... he watched them slow and slow as the morphine dripped in. ""How are you feeling?"" he asks halfway through the movie. ""Like shit"" I reply, ""But better, at least maybe I can sleep."" ""Try"" he said, ""try to sleep."" I drifted off and he said he watched my body lie still, finally at peace in his mind at least, and just as one of our favorite movies was about to end, in comes the nurse ""We need to send her home, and we need this room."" she tells him. ""But.... The Good the Bad and the Ugly is just about to end, can't I wait with her and finish, then we'll go?"" What a fucking guy. My dad is amazing, that is a thought I will never let go. He didn't get to finish the movie. He grabbed all my belongings and put it all in a bag, I left in hospital socks and two hospital gowns so I was covered. They wheeled me to the exit and a nurse stood with me while my dad pulled up the car. My mom had left hours prior. ""The pharmacy on x block will be open 24 hours and fill this for her"" the nurse said to my dad as he lifted me into the car.   


We get to the pharmacy, it's not my usual as my usual isn't open at 4 in the morning. My dad is inside waiting for my prescription, but I don't feel right, I open my door and lean out the car. I throw up for a few minutes, mostly dry heaves, and stay there, slumped over, head in my hands, hospital socks somehow still clean. ""Did you throw up?"" It still makes me laugh that he asked. ""No dad, it was the coyote"". He looks at me confused, because the joke doesn't make fuckin' sense... ""yeah Dad, I just threw up but I'm okay"". He closes my door gently and get's in the driver's side. He puts the script in my bag of clothes, rubs my back while encouraging I put on my seat belt again, I do so, and we get home safely.   


My mom is awake and comes to hug me, I hug her back and tell her ""I need to go lie down"" so they help me into my room comfortably and set all my stuff in the corner. I tell them I'm just going to sleep, that the pain is gone, and I just want rest.   


The pain is gone. It's GONE the next morning. I feel great. Like it didn't happen. I go to clean my things stacked into the corner of my room. I put everything away but one thing.... a script to a bunch of hydrocodone, I guess in case those other golf ball sized cysts rupture before I get on hormones or in my case, birth control. I toss them into the drawer with so many other pills, all the same. Maybe different colors and different letters, but they were all the same. I start to wonder about them. As time grows, my curiosity does too.

  
One night I had a headache, a migraine, the kind that pounds until you can't keep your eyes open but still can't sleep. I say fuck it, I try the pain medications I was so carelessly given so many times before. I'm not sure at that moment that I THOUGHT, I kind of think I just DID. I grabbed two like they were motrin and that was the beginning of the end. I caught a nod my second time taking a pill and I discovered the Wonderful World of Painkillers. But I thought it was just that.... I thought it was just a painkiller... I wasn't really sure on what they could DO or BE.  

The only thing I want now is to get off heroin. I want to get off heroin and I want to be that person that gets to tell others the DANGER of taking a pill prescribed by a doctor. DO YOUR RESEARCH I want to scream to the world. I grew up in a home without drugs. My parents didn't even know. When they finally found out I was using... they were SO confused. They were so ANGRY, and all I thought was, how can you be SO angry when you handed them to me? I'm glad opiates are a more well known term now and that more and more people know what that shit can lead to. But I wish my family and I had been that educated years ago...  


Now I move carefully each day as to not get into trouble. ""Don't get caught"" I tell myself every day. Just last week I thought I was going to jail. I had an unpaid ticket because I was in an accident, the cop said I'd get my ticket in the mail because his printer wasn't working? Whatever. I didn't seek that out. I was late for work the other day so I pushed it a bit too much and got pulled over. My fucking dumb fucking ass. Man I saw those lights behind me and as I shoved my heroin literally up my vagina, I plead with myself in my head, don't have a warrant don't have a warrant don't have a FUCKING WARRANT.   


The officer is at my window. H secured in my vagina purse, and both hand on top of the wheel. ""Stop your car and give me the keys"". I do as asked. ""Where are you going?"" I mutter ""work"", ""And from?"" ""my home on x block, officer"". ""Why were you speeding?"" I reply ""I work in 3 minutes"". He tells me ""Well, I guess you're not getting there on time today, huh?"" I can barely breathe. He says he'll be right back. I know my fate. A jail cell where the HOPEFULLY don't strip search me. And if they do? Jail eventually, most likely. Not a holding cell, JAIL. I wait forever it seems. I see the officer coming back, a ticket in his hand. I assume it means there's no warrant, and I almost cry. He steps up to my window, ""No more speeding okay? We don't want someone to get hurt.... you are shaking a bit though, sure you're alright darlin'?"" I admit it, ""no officer, I'm okay, just spooked by police in general you know?"" I force a giggle, trying to seem normal. He laughs too, and says ""Yeah, that happens, I understand. Don't take off now until you're okay.""

Taking Vitamin D helped with mood a little. 

It wasn’t easy. Still isn’t. But I now have hope. I can travel without worry. Money stacks up quick now. There’s a clearness in my eyes that my friends have noticed. I can pursue a relationship without worrying about dropping the addiction bomb at some point. And I don’t have to fear being sick if shit is dry. 

I didn’t join this sub until I quit, and for whatever reason, it helped me get through the tough stretches. You guys are an anomaly on reddit, because with the exception of one or two of you, everyone is predictably supportive and down to earth. If you’re thinking about quitting, there is light at the end of the tunnel. And for those dealing with wd right now, it ends. It really does. I was a cynical, skeptical prick two months ago, but the body heals itself. You have to find the strength in you (it is there) and stick it out. I think the biggest thing I learned was patience.

Anyway, I had a friend who got into heroin years ago and she'd occasionally crash on my couch. Before I knew she was using I noticed a distinct change in her body odor. It's hard to describe. Almost metallic but mixed with a very light sweet combined with musky. That still doesn't do it justice really. It's just a very heavy odor that you can almost taste. It's not BO. Not garlic or vinegary. And it wasn't for lack of showering as she'd take two a day at least when she was at my place.

I didn't think much of it until I ran into a guy yesterday who said he was an active user. And there that smell was again. Slight metal mixed with a hint of sweet and musky. EXACTLY the same as her. I also haven't seen that friend since she got clean so i don't know if that's still a thing for her and I certainly wouldn't ask her, because I feel it's just best not to bring up those days.

If you can provide me any evidence to back up that hypothesis show me! I'd love to actually find some evidence.

Now, for general opi rage. I'm a happy drunk and happy stoner. I understand those occasional angry drunks who misunderstood a situation getting angry when there isn't a justification...
I Don't understand opi rage at all tho. 

WD rage makes sense, but who the hell is actually angry? I only ever find sad/irritated/tired addicts. Nobody's out there being an asshole in WD When you'd think detox would effect their mood the most....


So Why do you think opi rage is so prevalent? I mean shit, they have what they needed now. If I spend a day in WD miserable, why would I get high just to spend it angry? 


I know I wouldn't get addicted to a drug that makes me uncontrollably irritated when hi. I actively avoid addicts with opi rage.

I find that's a bullshit excuse and the rager is usually being an overreacting drama whiner. I think they're simply self involved.  Being selfish snobs who somehow believe they don't annoy anyone themselves...I'll never understand them tbh. Especially since they just get angry and ruin getting hi sessions over pointless shit. ( opi rage couples are the worst to third wheel around)

Does anyone remember reading any papers studying any involuntary anger response by a brain reaction to opiates? 

I don't feel like diving in deep without referred sources tbh. So lmk if you've seen any academic discussions on this.



I'm bored obviously so lastly,

 what are things people commonly say to them that irritate or make you shake your head?...


 My personal example: 

""hey, pat said you're a history buff! Omg me too.! Can you believe puma punku is 12k old! Or how do you think they could build the pyramids? After all, it's a mystery! Levitation?! ""

RAGE. Thankfully mine dissipates quickly.

I was hiking and I fell 70 feet off the top of a mountain. Since then i have been in increasing pain. I started experimenting wit opiates before i broke my back but got more into them afterwards to help with the pain. I did heroin a few times while still in high school, i used to order it off the darknet. 

Last year i moved to a big city for college from the suburbs and have been in even more pain since moving to the city. I dont have a car and have to walk and take public transit which is very painful. Standing for over 15 minutes begins to hurt and i need to sit down, after an hour it feels like i am going to collapse. In the last year ive been using opiates more heavily lately just heroin but only a few days a week max because it is too expensive. I really like using it and getting high but im honestly over it, i hate waking up the morning after, my girlfriend who lives with me hates it, and obviously i dont want to be a heroin addict

I started seeing an orthopedic doctor this summer for the pain and he referred me to a physical therapist.  I have been going for a month and it has helped a little bit but i am still in so much pain. I feel like my doctor is reluctant to give me a prescription because of my age but the pain is unbearable. Should i schedule another appointment with my orthopedic doctor? How can i convince him to give me a prescription? He has all my records and we did xrays and MRIs and there are physical issues with my back like how my spine is shaped. 

Ive also been wondering if i could get on subs because i dont want to do heroin but i crave it so much especially when im in a lot of pain, and subs supposedly treat pain and cravings. ",1534733880.0

I can't remember the last time I took a Xanax, but I've been contemplating getting one today just so it'll show up in my piss tomorrow so I can claim that I have a ""big"" benzo habit in order to hopefully get more Xanax to get me thru this god damn impending opiate detox.

So, what can I expect for the next 30 days? Any advice?

Thanks

Been doing it for a little over a year now. Oxy got way too expensive, and they cut my script off, so my Ex suggested heroin. Started Oxy 3 years ago when I got shot point blank in the chest at 18 years old, they prescribed me 10s. My girlfriend at the time also was heavy into perks/oxy, she had torn her ACL multiple times. I’ve been shooting heroin up for about 4 months. Starting IV usage was the STUPIDEST thing I ever did in my drug ventures. Of course it gets you higher, withdrawals are also a lot worse. So if you smoke or snort, DONT START BANGING IT. Word of advice. I’ve tried to kick my habit a few times, spent about a year in the joint and was clean for like the first 3 months, but was fuckin nodding off subs or dope the last 9 months of my bid. Most recently I was clean for almost a month (with the help of Suboxone if you call that clean) but I relapsed 2 weeks ago. I don’t know why the fuck I do this to myself. I just love the high. I love the warm rush you get when you push that plunger into your arm. But I hate it too. I hate spending hundreds of dollars a week on heroin. I hate waking up sick some days because I couldn’t save a morning shot out of a whole gram I had the night before.  Idk what to do anymore. I gotta do something. Anyone else feel like this?

I can't remember where I saw it but I remember once seeing a paper, theory?! that ""heroin"" on the street is less a specific drug and more like some kind of opiate placeholder. In some nations ""heroin"" might be bupe, in others some kind of synthetic even decades ago. It seems weird to wonder but will actual heroin essentially become a DNM curio or something, for youngsters that want something exotic or old heads wanting the real deal? Will addicts actually get a taste and tolerance for fent analogs to where they will not be interested in actual acetylated morphine?

Could we see some harsh international crackdown on precursors that sends everyone back to real heroin?

Welp!  I keep all my pills in the same canister and I meant to take half a Xanax to fall asleep and accidentally took half of an m30 pill I was saving for next weekend.  I have a demanding day tomorrow  where I need to be firing on all 8 cylinders.  I took it at 11:30pm and have to be at work at 1pm.  I’m super worried I’m gonna be groggy and hungover tomorrow.

My question(s) are:

1) what can I do to not be totally groggy tomorrow if don’t have any Adderall?

2) will this fuck up my tolerance?  I weigh 119 lbs and usually take 1/4 of an m30 to Catch a pretty strong buzz.  Any more than that and I get incredibly itchy.  Plus I was planning on taking 1/4 of a pill next weekend with my GF for a little sexy time (since I’m a girl and an extremely casual user, roxys don’t fuck with my libido, I don’t have to worry about staying hard and I can always finish). Will taking 15mgs today reduce the euphoric effects if I take them next weekend?

I ended up having necrotic pancreatitis, and a spleenic vein thrombosis. Needless to say its VERY painful, and opiates are the only option. So it started with 1ml subcu 6 times a day. I was sent home and given 1mg tabs. They kind of worked at first, but was still pretty uncomfortable. So they upped it to 1mg, and 2mg when needed for pain (usually at night or in the mornings, when im not moving around, im on diuretics as well so bladder fills up and pushes on the other fucked up organs. Needless to say even now I generally wake up every 2-3 in pain. So I kind of have a few questions:

How can I make it stretch? Basically my doctor is only open 4 days a week, so I have to think far in advance when I need more. The last two times I renewed a prescription either the doctor or pharmacy messed up and ran out. Think its 5-10 mg day is my acceptable level so I can run out in 6-12 days. So Knowing this id have to cut in half whatever I had just to function (it sucked). I dont really know much about the other delivery methods if I need/had to do that just to get some sleep.

Secondly, I wouldnt even know how to find a dealer, what its worth, etc. If I had to. Obviously this is not my #1 option, but the alternative is debilitating pain, and probably back in ER. 

Thirdly they simply dont seem to be effective anymore. Ive given what I have taken so 1ml subcu for 2 weeks, 5mg/day, for just over a week, and 8-10/day for the last two weeks. Is it possible to have a tolerance at this point? If so, how do I bring that up with my doctor? At current its always needed morning/night, but on a really good day dont need as much during the day (moving around, endorphines im guessing). On a bad day I need alot more.

To clean it, I used to just scrape it with a paper clip to get everything out, put it on some foil, and smoke away. But I've found that putting my finger over one end and putting a few drops of boiling hot water into the other end, covering that end with my finger, and then vigorously shaking it for about 2 minutes, works a lot better to get the resin out. After that, I take a large piece of foil, dump the resin-y water onto it, and evaporate the water to leave behind the resin, which I promptly smoke.

I am new to Spain. I get kidney stones every few years and periods of severe migranes 2x a week that then disappear for months. Can someone familiar with Spanish pharmacies tell me what I should ask a doctor for? I need a an equivalent for Vicodin ES (migranes), and an equivalent for fast release Morphine 30 or 60 mg (kidney stones). Generic is best as trademark items are very expensive here if you have to pay cash. I can get 30mg cody / 500mg paracetamol fizzy tabs for 12cents each over the counter, but they don't do the job anymore and all that paracetamol is better avoided.

I tried asking the doc for something stronger than codiene, he flat out refused to give me opiates and instead gave me Novotil (metamizol), which is a decent painkiller, but I had a reaction which wiped out all my white blood cells and had me in the ICU for a week with huge infections and black rotting toes! This is a documented syndrome effecting persons of western European heritage for some reason, and Spain will probably join the rest of the world in banning Novotil.

I started smoking pot frequently freshman year of high school and throughout the years I was getting worse I started to really try pills, coke, and other illicit drugs my junior year and by senior year I was pretty addicted to using drugs just either had couple day/week binges then be sober or only use a couple days a week if that but now a year has past exactly since I started using suboxone daily for 1 year now my family has been trying to get me off then to save my life as I’ve never seen a problem with them by prescription but the only way I’d take them was IV or nasally mainly nasally but for a month or two I shot 2 subs a day for awhile but finally stopped and switched to snorting so I see I do still have a problem I just want my life to change for my sake/life and for my family and friends to be proud an back to the person they use to know not what the drugs turned me into.  

I snuck subs into rehab as I got out a couple days ago and began detoxing I’m on the 3rd day of detox and it’s getting better each day especially the mindset on what lies ahead of me sober and if I’ll return back to normal but for 21 days I snorted up to a whole sub throughout the day to stay off sick and that place really taught me a lot an I truly do have a desire to stop using I just really need it work it but I just want some advice on how people stayed sober for years and years I shot heroin for a couple weeks and snorted/smoked it for 2 months before I got back on subs and am so grateful to have got off that shit but I really want my life back and to turn normal again so if you read this thank you I really needed to vent and would love advice from this sub as I use to frequent a lot and saw many great people on here but some asshole too 
       Anyways thanks for reading I hope I get something useful from this !! I’m really sitting in bed feeling sorry for myself while detoxing but I know life will get better the more time I have under my belt

Addicts are no more selfish than normal people. In fact, the situation sometimes demands selfishness.

For example, your acquaintance asks to share your dub, which barely has two shots and you need one for your wake up. If you share, you won't be able to get to work in the morning and so miss a day's pay and perhaps get fired.

You see, it's not like sharing half your sandwich at lunch time. In fact, addicts frequently share food, drnks, clothing and blankets even though we will go hungry or cold.

Should i stop taking my Suboxone now, and start again later on? at a dose of 0.5mg ? (i usually take between 0.5 to 2 mg )

According to him, some man comes running in, screaming,  yelling,  thrashing around, screaming that the doctor gave him naloxone and asking what it was. The poster said he never saw a man out of control like that and that his girlfriend told him that looked like classic withdrawal.

Uh, what?

The guy claimed to have video, then said it was just audio, then said you couldn't hear anything but screaming anyway. 

Uh, no. We can all see the holes in this story.  But why tell it? This made me remember this twerp I knew.  He claimed to have been a heroin addict.  The minute I started chatting to him, it was clear it was all bullshit.  You should have heard his story about the concerned doctors at his bedside after he od'd. Drama king this idiot. He didn't know anything.  Not a thing. I asked him where he copped.  He said ""uptown."" Where? He didn't remember.  What stamps were on the bag? He didn't know. He was so full of it.

anyways,

so i need to find a more discreet way of using, so i decided to try to make some “cheese” since all we have over on the WC is tar. i used baked powder and about a gram of tar after freezing it, put it in an advil bottle with some nickles and shook the shit out of it. 

only thing is i was being a dumbass and definitely dumped way too much baking powder in but that’s why i ended up adding another half gram of tar to make it a full gram. 

i just want to know from people with experience does this shit look alright? already know i’ll be using way less powder next time lol.  

thanks again

I've even had one follow me out the door asking me for it. I should've called the police, but I'm not a snitch. And even if I wanted to sell them, I couldn't, because I take them for pain.

The stigma is very real. It's real for pain sufferers, anxious people, depressed people, addicts, and disabled people, etc...

Let me preface by saying yes, I am an idiot. I knew subs were for heroin maintenance. I knew it was potent for those with minor opioid tolerances. I knew it was extremely addicting. I didn't care, it cured me, even if temporarily. I'm still not sure I care completely about quitting.

I developed legitimate, minor addiction after 2 weeks straight of use around Oct. Nov. 2017. I had been using sparingly since 2014-2016  obtaining the drug from my fathers medicine stash (although I would also sparingly use opis from other sources such as tram (lots, although no dependence developed), and rarely hydro and oxy). It has been a monkey on my back ever since, I've kept it secret pretty well but I am worried my sparing use will lead to me losing my job, as dealing with the WD on the sales floor of a retailer is hell on earth. 

However my question is, could I get prescribed subs for my... sub addiction? Or am I better off pulling a tall tale and saying I was using oxy/h.

Feedback greatly appreciated.,"So heres a little backstory. About 10 months ago I tried H for the first time and didnt really think about how serious of a decision I made and honestly didnt ever think about a possible addiction in the future but before you know it I was doing the shit everyday, only ever snorted never banged.

Things got out of hand pretty quickly and I realized I had to do something so I tapered my habit down to about half a point of (china white?) a day and then last week I went to a health center around where I live and was put on Clonidine and Gabapentin to help with any withdrawal symptoms I may experience while trying to quit. 

The reason Im confused is that its been 5 days and ive only taken .1mg Clonidine and 300mg Gabapentin once or twice a day and the only physical symptom of withdrawal Ive even noticed has been insomnia. Which I already experienced here and there before ever doing opiates, and it wasnt even that bad. Ive slept atleast 4 hours a night the past 5 days or so. 

Is this normal? Since my habit began Ive had to go without H a few times not by choice and it seemed to be a lot worse. The anxiety and everything, but this time ive had almost next to no anxiety about it and pretty much zero withdrawal symptoms. Is it just the meds doing their job or what? I havent even veen taking the recommended daily dose. 

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Previous to H I'd only done percs and opanas here and there so Im pretty opiate naive compared to most people with a habit. Thanks in advance!",1534551884.0

The last 8 months of using were speedballs while popping 4mg of xanax, 60mg of Addy everyday.

So back in December a bunch of bad shit started to occur. One morning i'm walking into my job and there are multiple desk so everyone kind of greets you, to my luck a loaded rig fell out of my jacket and bounced on the ground and the room was silent as my boss's eyes started to water...Everyone thought I was clean again and here I was just to hurt everyone again. I left to get high and to kill myself. At this time  I was using multiple times a day and got sepsis from multiple Staph infections and my body started to reject the H. I would register and then up or down the vein it would start to balloon under my skin and I started missing even when hitting the Jugular. I was so depressed and couldn't really get high so I was WD and decided to cut myself thinking I should just die, as I cut I noticed my blood was extremely sticky. Out of all the red flags in my life this was the only thing that got my attention. I went to the doctor and was told if I don't stop ill die.

So fast forward I stop using and it was withdrawals I didn't even know existed. I had a fever for about 80 days, extreme depression with normal WD stuff. I somehow never got out of the acute WD stage. How the fuck is that possible?? So then I go use for about 2 months and quit by using loperamide for 2 weeks then kratom a week after and then the WDs were a joke, I was a little sad for a few days and that was it.

So what I was wondering is if you do a good taper and make WDs less extreme then you won't deal with the acute or PAWS as long??

Ive been clean now over 100 days and at no time have I seriously considered getting high. I don't know how this is possible. Im usually miserable. I'm even training for a half marathon and ran 9 miles the other day. Like who the fuck am I and why do I feel normal again? ",1534536165.0

I've been shooting up 4- 5 2.5mg dillies for the past 2 months. I was previously on MMP 5mg a day.
I found 70ug/hr 40mg patches and I know that's too high for what I need.


The question is: can I cut the patches in a way that I can use them to get a lower dose?

I need to stop now or my wife will take my kid away.

These patches are the ones that come with a metal layer to start the release, I was thinking about cutting the whole thing and leave the metal part there until I use it.

Please help.

Now I know this is highly frowned apon, and highly discouraged in the name of harm reduction.  


I have been IV'ing the pink liquid methadone you get from the clinics. Using a 3cc/3ml, 23g syringe, I am able to shoot half of a dose in one shot using these syringes.   


Here is where things get interesting. You know how orally, it takes methadone 1+ hour(s) to kick in? Well, via IV it kicks in instantly, with a rush and it is far more euphoric and warm than when you take it orally. It is on par, IMO, with H. It is amazing.  


Now, here is where harm reduction comes in. IV'ing anything that isn't made for IV is NOT GOOD. But upon further review, if you are being prescribed VistaPharm methadone, it is 100% safe to inject.   


Other INACTIVE ingredients in the liquid methadone solution:  
 **SORBIC ACID,**  **POTASSIUM SORBATE, POLOXAMER 188,** **GLYCERIN, PROPYLENE GLYCOL,**  **SUCROSE** and **WATER**   


Poloxamer 188 is related to Propylene Glycol. It is used to stabalize the solution. Propylene Glycol is actually used to make IV solutions, as is Poloxamer 188.   


So relatively safe, but as with IV'ing anything, it is not 100% safe, as there are still the risks that are associated with IV drug use. I am not sure what is in the other Methadone Oral solutions made by other companies, but if you are prescribed the VistaPharm brand, it is fairly safe to do.   


It is a lot of liquid to inject, but that rush and euphoria is something that I never expected from Methadone. ",1534520472.0

Eventually, I did get withdrawal, but it took a while. Take a short break and start using again, and the withdrawal symptoms are back in DAYS.

These don't go away, thats why even after a long, long break, you will be in withdrawal with just a couple of days of using.

My plan:

Exhaust myself with a little meth.. there’s method to my madness, I want to use as little of my benzos as possible to get to sleep-, but once I go to sleep on the first day  here’s the plan....

5-10MG of Lorazapem, + 300-600MG of lyrica, as my primary withdraw agents

Will titrate with Clonindine - which might even help with the leg pain 

Looking @ all interactions they seem to compliment and enhance each other, which is why we will be monitoring blood pressure, to keep it low but not under 70.


Bananas bananas bananas - that will be my food.

I have 10 8MG Ondanzetron for when or if the vomiting starts, plus immodium for the other end

Panadol for pain, & chewable vitamin c to help flush my system of all metabolites.

Water water water -

Hospital is 4 minutes away - should something go wrong.

If I cave, I have 32MG of Bupe tablets, & I will take them 1-2MG  absolutely ONLY if the Ativan & other combos don’t hold me at bay...& I reach for the oxy. 

I suffer anxiety, shaking, and hot cold sweats - I never get a runny nose, or the runs or anything it’s fucken weird ..

But -

That’s my plan.

Anyone see any issues?

I’ve waited until my mind is ready. In the past I’ve not been ready, and I’ve managed to go 24 hours & withdrawal was fucked ... if I only I could have held on for 24 more hours I might have climbed the mountain side ... to start shimmying my way down...

This time - 

I don’t need to hide anything, I don’t have to worry about being functional ...for a few days

I've been to literal war, I've risked my life countless times over countless things: stupid or otherwise. Yet here is where I always feel so scared.

That's what got me the last time) but enough to be afraid you'll fuck up the few days you did manage to gather. Enough to be so afraid it's easier to just give in. Or is that just another excuse?

Because honestly I've been trying to understand myself and trying to understand my addiction and there are a thousand right answers and seemingly no wrong ones. Same goes for all the fucked up shit that goes in my head: I can't figure out why, ever, because there seem to be no wrong answers. Only right ones that come to me like epiphanies as I wipe my asshole. One day I can suddenly \*\*understand why\*\* for fuck's sake I'm as trusting as a dead cat then three months later suddenly understand \*why\* again - and both answers fit. So which is it?

If I'm going to be called the junkie, I might as well  go back to the junk, right?  Emnrace it, even though I've quit for now.
-------

I've really thought of myself as a junkie, but I'm just coming off an opiate addiction that went from a few pills every day to a lot of mgs of oxy  every day, to snorting a few points of heroin every day.  The whole thing lasted about 2 years this time and led me to try H for the first time in 2016.  

Fast forward to 2018 and I finally follow through on a commitment I made to my husband to get off opiates, but I'm doing it for me.  I even walked away from a decent hydrocodone prescription that got me by about one week a month, even though it was over 100 pills/month.

I quit everything in July with a mild taper and kratom, as well as the usual gaberpentin, weed, benzos.  Withdrawals weren't hell to me, probably from the kratom I'm now wanting to wean off of.  I got 31 days off H and 29 days off All opiates, when last week I was presented with a rare 4 nights alone, so I slipped and had a three day run that no one knows about but me.  After one day off I used again for two days last weekend, after having to put my dog down.

Last Saturday night after my husband and kids went to bed, and just hours after watching my dog die, I must have done a big dose and nodded out all over the house, including falling down in the kitchen and hitting my head on the bathroom mirror, nodding out while brushing my teeth.  Thank God nobody woke up.

Sunday night I did another big dose before bed and projectile vomited in front of my husband.  He couldn't even tell I was high, just thought I was sick.

This Monday morning  I woke up and said that was it.  I was saving over half g for my birthday, which is this weekend.  I ended up dumping all the heroin I had left (not the first time I've done this) and took some kratom instead.  I puked my first spoonful of that, but the rest of the week has gone pretty smooth.  Until tonight when my husband found out I smoked a little pot.  He called me a junkie for smoking pot, even though I've been on H a lot of times around him and he rarely notices.  When he does I just say it's my pain and anxiety pills.  I get no credit for quitting opiates.  He's actually ok with me taking pain pills by doctor prescription.  It's just hard to get a satisfying prescription these days.

He thought I was through with pot, he says tonight, but he sends mixed signals because sometimes he realizes it helps me with anxiety and pain, and minimized my use of harder drugs.

So now I'm the junkie, although I've never tried a needle, have fairly successfully quit opiates (it's a process), and he only knows about the pills anyway.  Maybe I should carry on with my commitment to quit the poppy plant, or maybe I should just become who I really am, be the junkie and go on one more run.  

In Breaking Bad Jessie embraces being a criminal (I'm the bad guy) and in Justified Boyd Crowder embraces, and comes to terms with being the Outlaw.  Perhaps I should heed my hubby's words and just embrace being the junkie.  I do feel I have one more run in me and I might as well do it while I can still stomach the horrible kratom that keeps me going now and will help me quit when it's time.",1534483055.0

I will sometimes, when I buy a good amount of pills 50-100-120, if I know they have been hidden tucked in the sellers underwear or if like today I am told by one of my dealers that he currently just got out of the hospital for a double bad eye infection and he just touched all these pills when he counted them and they were in his possession for a little while which im sure at some point probably he touched his face/eyes and touched the pills without washing his hands.


When I do occasionally end up needing to do this, I will just lightly soak a paper towel in 90% isopropyl Alcohol and one by one lightly rub each pill with the towel then throw them into a container to dry. I get that I may be a bit over reacting and my buddy called my weird earlier but these are things I am going to literally be eating so it gives me a little peace of mind knowing they are clean & disinfected now.


Actually while I was doing this earlier I saw amazon sells a UV light phone cleaner/ disinfector which I thought would be perfect for this application, as I wouldn't have to get the pills slightly wet with alcohol even though it dries almost immediately. Then I realized that might be a bit overkill plus I don't know if it would effect the pills potency in any way.

What do you guys think am I a weirdo for wanting to protect myself from who the fuck knows what after you get some pills that might have been tucked inside a baggie in some d-boys underoos or possibly have some infectious virus on it in my case.. or am I just being a big pussy going overkill with my germaphobia ?

I also bought some Fent Test strips and Mecke Regent test just so I can make sure when I have any doubts that something I might be getting is a little off, some of these fake presses getting made today can really be hard to tell even if you have the real thing right next to it to compare to which I try to keep one of each of the most common 30s around for reference because I do buy in bulk but not reselling them its all just personal use for my monster habit which sucks and I have to get under control by the end of the summer hopefully.",1534481164.0

I just inadvertently pissed off my aquaitance(friend, in reality)/middle. He's a really cool dude and I like him but he was charging me way too much for the amount of risk he actually took, I always waited for him to be making the run anyway (unless I was sick, he earned his money those days 💯), the girl lives in a fairly nice part of town, and I always drove his ass wherever he needed to before/after we did a run (and he took proper advantage of this) and I'd always buy him shit like water, sodi pops, cigarettes or whatever cause I don't like my friends going without, but don't get me wrong, that has no bearing on this situation cause I'd do that for whoecer, if we're friends I got you, and I know you got me if I'm in need. I can understand a middle who had to work for it (walking/ driving himself to the plug, going into a dangerous or hot part of town) charging everytime and never just doing it to be a good guy, but this guy had the best situation possible with me. I know for a fact with me coming, his runs were easier, and more likely to succeed. 

Fast forward to today; I get a call from the dude, he's not home, but he wants to go see the plug. All good, he tells me to pick him up at his friend's house so off I went down to the ghetto of the city we live in. When he walks out he is visibly high on crack; how can I tell it's crack you ask? Since we have little to none of them methamphetamines where I'm from. Well... very little anyway, i've seen pressed ICE pills, they're suspect to say the least, anyway my point is, dude is definitely smoking hard, and he is in full window watching/carpet surfing, paranoid about Alexa listening in on us mode. Shit, dude was sitting down in the car, but hitting up that crackhead shuffle. Dude was also trying to drink water, and if you know crack, you'll know how hard/ awkward it is to try and drink something, even with the thirst of a black dog in the scorching heat, drinking water on crack always goes weirdly.

Anyways, he finally decides it's time to call and get my run on the go, I wanted the one gram of cocaine, and four 4mg dilaudid, that's 150 (gram Tony Montana100, 8mg=$25) and this price is pretty good, standard in my area. So after checking his pockets, I see he's definitely missing something after he asked to use my phone, I realize he's missing his phone. At this point my junkie brain is scheming, I know I can get the number from this guy, I just need him to think he can use my phone, and that his is fine until we get back.  I convinced him, saying I didn't have time or the fuel to be going back since we are going back there after anyways. So after he uses my phone to call the plug, dude is way too high and not tech savvy enough to worry or even think about the plugs number in my shit. GOTTEM.

 So after we make the usual run, which in his state, took 25 minutes of talking (probably about some bs that only he cares about his car, his phone, whatever his crack riddled brain is settlling on!) I bet the plug was ready to kill herself for real. We go back to his place to do a shot. I do up a nice speedball, decided to try 8mg dilaudid + 2 pointsish of blow, by the way the girl is easily 8/10, it completely dissolves without even mixing, tastes like pure diesel and rings your fucking bell like crazy! (As you can likely tell from my post here, but frankly fuck it, you guys understand lol im gonna put a video in the comments of this shit dissolving like sugar) I even hit a vein first poke! Fuck yeah, i'm feeling like Ice Cube, today was a good day. 

Fast forward 2 days later, my main plug just  ran out of 8mg shields (the heart shaped 8mgs) and im getting ready to call my friend and go thru the bs and the extra money (it really sucks to get a good price on 8s for 3/4 of the month, then dude absolutely rapes me every single time we made a run). The run would take 5-10 minutes out of his life since the girl he went to was on disability and always wanted to make money, she only leaves home like 3 times a week for groceries, to play cards on Friday, and her daughters Sunday dinner we never had to wait or fuck around with her, probably the most professional dealer ive ever met (which is going to turn out great at the end of this story for me lol) she always gave him something to drink and tried to get him to eat, she was basically drug dealing grandma, not to mention this lady is always awake early, and will stay up late if you ask her to be ready, she will. She gets a large script for her hips, and this is her money she's hoarding away for her daughter and husband, this lady is a legitimate saint. 

Everytime he would charge me 20 bones, and a point of blow. So 30 bucks every.single.time I went on a run, and basically it was me driving him to the spot, for free and then giving him money and shit cause he knew the right person, which I never objected to, she had amazing blow and always had pills, so it was worth the little bit of extra money, but my ""friend"" never gave me a break, even on days that he got more than I did, on principle he ""had to charge me, his time is valuable""

So im scheming, deciding what im going to do for a plug since my main is out for the remainder of the month, than I remember about the number. I thought hard about it for at least a half hour, I like my friend, hell I even enjoy the drama and excitement that goes along with the run, it's part of the reason I like this drug and the game so much, it's always an adventure. But the money was killing me, I'm working hard, OT every day in the heat, planning  and working toward moving on up to a better apartment and some upgrades to my car and bike. So I decided to send her a text, she knew who I was instantly, my friend clearly calls on my phone, and they must chat about me during the deal. I straight up told her the truth, that I was a good customer, and that I loved the way she did business, but that I couldn't continue with it, purely monetary. She understands and tells me to come thru, I bring the usual 150, fully prepared to pay it but turns out it was only 125, my friend was adding 25 bucks into the coke, AND charging me 20 and a point. So at this point I don't even feel bad, I just love that this worked out. 

Today I get the text ive been waiting for, the dealing grandma, saint of the dope game, had finally informed my friend how she thought I was a lovely guy, and thanked him for the business by giving him a half, and an 8, 75 dollar business getting bonus! But dude is pissed at me, actually he says his ""feelings are hurt and I trusted you"", he says he enjoyed the runs and having me to hang out with, and he would have brought me in with him, so basically he would have got her to lie for him about prices, all while giving me the illusion that he isn't dry fucking my little virgin b-hole, and that it has nothing to do with the money 🙄. So anyway now im at a crossroads, I don't necessarily want to lose this friend, he's a good guy, but I just couldn't handle the fucking anymore. 

Anyways, what would you guys do? Would you cut him out (wouldn't be the end of the world, but I don't mind the guy, and it's hard to find friends who don't steal or whatever) or would you maybe just keep calling him to do runs? But renegotiate the prices. I'm opting to buy him a full g of blow, and a few pills just to shut him up about it. Help me out here. 

TL;DR- I had a ""friend"" that made runs for me, but charged me out the ass, I picked up said friend while he was high on crack, and basically schemed the plugs number out of him, got gud with the plug and now ""friend"" is upset, says it's about hanging, I know it's about money. ",1534473482.0

I’m a 28 year old on Suboxone and Klonopin. Please read and relate. I’d like to hear your story and how you overcame it (or still stuck in it) if you can relate.,"Can anyone relate to this?  I was pretty much a good kid in high school.  I had a great childhood and I never really did anything bad in high school.  Sure I partied but so did everyone else.  Weed and alcohol junior and senior year.  I always fill my mind with the past as to why I’m like this now.  College came (community then big schools) and that’s where everything slowly but surely got worse.  My drug habits got more diverse and my alcohol use went up.  It seemed to be the only thing fun about college.  I still graduated but it didn’t mean shit to me.  Basically my life has been regret since.  Regret about why I studied what I studied.  Why wasn’t I normal ?  I had a hot girlfriend for almost 3 years, experienced love, experienced basically everything a kid would growing up. 


Fast forward to now and I’m stuck on these thoughts: was it because I always admired crazy people and the biggest parties because they excited me most?  Was it because I got caught up with the wrong people?  I mean as kid I always wanted to break the rules even if it was breaking them lightly, like going to the neighborhood you weren’t allowed to go in because it was too far  (I always use the term it’s all relative).  I would quit a lot of things.  Start them and never finish.  I did break my arm as a sophomore and got prescribed opiates to this day I don’t remember what they were but I liked the feeling and especially the morphine drip they put me on in the hospital with the button.  I loved that button

My point is does anyone who takes subs think about this as they get older and let it plague them?  Also, if there is anyone similar to me I’d like to hear your story.  I’m on subs for 10 months now with 3 or 4 1 week benders in the middle.  Don’t know why I chose this route because I feel like it’s just a bandaid not fixing the problem but it’s the route I chose.  The problem is, in rehab I couldn’t figure out the problem!  Why I got like this in the first place.  Is it because of the genetic disease like they say in rehab?  I never believed that.  Whether it’s true or not I feel like I still could have avoided it.  I was one of those people that never took it too far but far enough that it became a major problem and the one that affects me most in my everyday life.  I’m definitely an addict I know that, but I never did as much in one sitting as the people around me and never shot up, never ODED etc.  Everyone in rehab would say “you will if you keep using” and that would piss me off so much.  I started to think I was better than them (which I wasn’t) either way rehab was a fail.  I got 100 or so days of all opiates but the alcohol use slowly affected more and eventually I went back, broke my collarbone a month later, it got worse, I was jobless at the time so after that bender I said fuck it I threw in the towel and went on subs thinking it would be easy like it was in the past on subs.  It’s not easy !  I moved to Chicago from Jersey for a new job in June, but I’m not joyful.  I don’t feel clean either, and I don’t take my job seriously nor am I motivated.  I also watch and read a time wasting amount of opiate related things (documentaries, movies, YouTube vids, reddit).  I’m debating starting all over.  Can’t take a shit to save my life (or a piss for that matter).  I always thought this would be memory by the time I was 28 and we would look back at that time be like “damn we were crazy and stupid” but LOOK AT ME NOW FOLKS.

Iv tapered from 100-120 mgs per day down to 60 in the last month and just took my last tramadol last night. (25 mgs) 

For comfort meds I have some short acting sleep meds, lots of loperamide (radiation to the gut so Iv needed it daily for weeks), a little lomotil, CBD and marinol. 

To my benefit I think my body weight is way below normal, meaning I have very little body fat (normally 120-130 currently 96 lbs which is why I was given marinol). And I take diuretics twice daily along with magnesium and potassium. I dont know if there is any logic behind it but I suspect the diuretics probably keep chemicals flushed out of my system because when I was taking the norco it really only helped for about 2 hours leaving me with four hours in between where I was pretty damn uncomfortable. Maybe I was just to tolerant but one more reason to get my bodies own natural pain controls kicked back in and stop depending on liver killing pills. 

So my question is, should I ask my oncologist for anything else to help ease me away or should I be fine at this point? Iv had a lot off health issues in the last five years or so and had to come off pain meds a few times after a couple of months but not this long or at this big of a dosage. The last few days as Iv taken less and less Iv noticed some muscle soreness, more gut irritation than usual (crampy feeling) and a little bit of tingling restless leg/arms and needing to stretch without relief.

Now 6 months later I smoke H for the second time, well I was supposed to do it earlier but it was so low on my mind that I forgot it. It was pleasant like last time but a bit less actually, maybe the setting was not as good or the dope less powerful (I doubt it though since it made me throw up at the end).

So, is it normal that it's less good as the first time if I wait so long or the dope was maybe less good? Anyway, fun drug I enjoy it but what a waste of time sitting on the couch all day.

Whatever it is, coke, tar (never shot good powder dope), crystal, hell I’ve even shot mdma lol, every shot seems to take about a minute to hit. I do get a rush, I think, but it’s def different from what a lot of people report. I guess I kinda like having a second to put my stuff away, rinse my rig out, put a hot compress on if needed. 

I just did a half point coke shot and went through that little routine. Then it started to hit me, after about a minute, so I laid down and wrote this. Not the best gear so .05 was a dumb small hit so I’m already back to baseline. I only have a pathetic .26 bag so I’m deciding whether to just slam the rest of the .2 (and yak a lot) or do two probably enjoyable .1 pushes. I’m one of those “I’m not a stimulant guys” who still does hardcore stim shit all the time but still tries to avoid the real rough edges of that game. I ate a hulk to calm myself down but a .2 shot still might be a little much. 

But so yeah, I’ve had other addicts agree that it’s not *that* fast but I see threads on here where people talk about feeling it just seconds after pushing down. My average seems to be about a minute before I start to feel it, maybe another 30 seconds to peak. Sometimes I hop around and hyperventilate and swing my arms around but I don’t think that even does much more than just standing up and taking a few quick steps. I have a super fast metabolism too, what gives? I feel like I’m missing something.



Also, completely unrelated crack head tangent here, there was a big news story recently, like national news somehow, was posted in here, about that billionaire dude Henry Nicholas. I guess the chick with him is an aspiring Real OC Housewife so I was reading all about their past scandals and scoping her IG and shit. That kind of lifestyle is already so morbidly fascinating but shit really gets crazy when you add a bunch of hard drugs. I don’t even live far from Newport I gotta get in touch with Henry Nicholas and make him hire me as his personal assistant.

So I wrote down the way I remember it.,"  I regained consciousness with narrowed vision, feeling disoriented and short of breath. 

'Fuuuuuck,' was the first thing I thought to myself looking up at the EMTs, firemen, and policemen who were crowding my body's resting place on the floor between the coffee table and the couch. My second thought was of her, and so my eyes shot around the room wildly, between the bodies of the men and women who just saved my life as they spoke slowly and loudly telling me I'd overdosed, and inquired as to whether I knew on what. Of course I knew, but I lied and said heroin. I made eye contact with her in that moment and my heart simultaneously sank and split in two. She held our cat, bobbing her up and down as you would a newborn to get them to sleep. In this case it was more likely an instinctual reaction to trauma. Like ventilation for excess, since her drenched eyes and cheeks suggested the normal avenues were well beyond capacity. I got up slowly against the resistance of the EMTs gently trying to push me back down into sitting position, telling me I need to take it easy. ""I need to hug her."" It felt stupid that I needed to state something that was so obvious to me. I felt like a fucking caveman using those words. As I got up and walked slowly toward her with someone's hand resting on my shoulder as if to make sure I don't take a spill, and also remind me that this ordeal isn't over, her body shudders and she bursts into tears. I take her in my arms and with my left hand I squeeze her head against my chest and my right around her waist, pulling her into me. 

""I'm sorry, I didn't know what to do. I panicked and I couldn't do the narcan. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,"" She cries out over and over again between gasps to breathe and helpless piercing cries that by this point made me lose my shit entirely. We both sobbing and apologizing profusely for a minute before I backed up and placed my hands on her cheeks in a futile attempt to wipe her tears away. In that moment I found myself meticulously savoring the shape of her face and the beautiful, glistening brown sorrow in her eyes. A sense of urgency struck me as if I'd never see her again, and a surge of panic cleared my foggy senses. I took this opportunity to calm myself, just long enough to memorize the  devastated expression on the face of the woman I love- the woman I'd just broken and lost forever in a way I didn't yet realize. My heart soaked up the guilt in these precious few seconds, where it hardened and eventually cracked, leaving me scarred and broken right along with her to this day. She finally looked me in the eyes. 

""I'm so sorry. Thank you for saving me. I don't want to die. I don't want to do this anymore. I love you. I love you."" I would have repeated the same few sentences ad nauseam if it weren't for the EMTs telling me it's time to go. I squeezed her one last time and said ""I love you.""

No wonder she left me.",1534418719.0

Reddit commentators quickly pointed out the irony that this test would just attract gays on both sides, tested and tester.

Well it strikes me that the more rules and regulations pain management clinics pile on patients, the only ones willing to submit to them or take the time and effort to study them and take it seriously are people who are hopelessly addicted or selling their script so they have a profit motive. Entire conduct guidebooks and rules you must follow, unwritten rules that depend on each location or even individual doctors, random drug tests you must do with an hours notice, pill counts, pill safes , required hours of physical therapy or alternative treatments, psychological counseling and it goes on and on. 

Actual patients in excruciating pain or end of life care or cancer patients ain't got time or brain power for all that, most of these people have trouble getting out of bed even with narcotics, and forget following byzantine rules or you're cut off. I've seen real human beings in stage four cancer on chemo or life ruining pain, these people are lucky to be functional enough to remember to carry their ATM card when they go out for fast food, and thats usually the big accomplishment of the week.

The more rules and bullshit they pile on they seem like they are just creating a concentrated pool of functional addicts or straight scammers. Just something ironic I noticed.",1534418485.0

 I remember being so intensely jealous that people could wake up, *brush their teeth*, and **walk to the store**. Maybe humm a little song to themselves. Maybe get excited about something coming up in a few weeks. All of these normal people didn't realize how lucky they were to be able to feel good by such tiny things. And I remember this and believe that using was nothing but being nostalgic of past rewarding sobriety.

But those were just the bad times.

 I don't think I had any of those thoughts while high. Going to score dope was an amphetamine rush. Making the exchange was like crack. No shits to have while drawing up.  

There's no longing for normalcy when you're nodding so hard that you hit your head on your broken subwoofer and still not have a care in the world.

Whether you're deep in addiction or running the 12 steps, people are rarely happy.  When I'm hooked and feel like shit it seems salvation is in being clean.  When I'm clean and feel like shit it's obviously in being high.

Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
Prescription made...
Painkillers

Count your blessings early 
Before the lot will hit the gates
Winnings for the lucky living just takes 
Painkillers

Living just comes with a bit of heartache
Heartache comes with a bit of young faith
Faith stays young till your heart get broken
Hope grows up to become someday
I never hurt no one and no one will ever hurt me
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Faith plays dumb till the doubts all leave
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Manna won't fall till the people all speak
I believe I believe I believe I believe
Canaan ain't far for the souls who barter their pain for sweet relief

My queen won't feed on milk and honey
She impartial to the summer sun
She's a lone fire burning in the sand
And a cold, lonely night without one
She cocks her pistols 'fore she pops her collar
Oh she's all but lethal pulling off that laser gun
She's rips the halos off of angels for the fun of it
If all she ever does is smile at you, run
What'd ya need these for?
Round here the cries die young
Fly momma, fly to where you come
Speak momma, round here the quiet die young

Very lovely morning
Don't kill yourself today
Think of all that you'd be missing
And don't you ever pay mind to that line in your way that says you'll ruin it
You'll ruin this for everybody won't you
Very lovely morning
Try not to kill yourself today
Think of all the things you'll be missing

But i have crippling pain
Im scared shitless that i won't be treated for my pain if my MRI results do not display any new details about my injuries

I am one of those people that are in the predicament of , being trapped in the Suboxone ""Opiate Addict"" cycle

And thats not saying that i am a opiate addict, drug user, etc. i am a user of buprenorphine . it doesnt matter the reason i started using it


On the way out of the doctors office, after the doctor had prescribed me Tramadol,he told me ""i do not want to give opiates to an opiate addict""

Why am i automatically grouped in with addicts because i seek pain relief?

This has happened to me quite a few times.

Some Doctors refer me to pain clinics, some doctors blatantly state they WILL NOT TREAT ME whatsoever . (With Narcotic or Non- Narcotic medicines)

My primary doctor now thinks im a drug addict cause' i take Bupe.

The people at the hospital, when i tell them 1 or 2mg of bupe, twice a day, they think i either take 8mg-2mg twice a day (i.e. 16mg of bupe) they think i am a hardcore drug addict

Suboxone initially probably did save my life but now all it does is get me high lol -_- . 

Suboxone is 25 to 50 times as strong as morphine
Buprenorphine used to be HIGHLY sought after in Europe , in rural areas 1 suboxone tablet selling for up to $120 each and is becoming the choice drug in jail aside from heroin etc. 

you see the people that takes opiates are usually in some sort of pain,
or even recreationally most people do not get addicted ...

How can some countries have opiates OTC, and others not?

The government does what the voters want us to do and because we all ramble on about how bad opioids are, they're getting banned .


When i was younger, i had no trouble getting scripts for low-dose oxy or hydrocodone. Now  i have to suck the doctor, nurse, pharmacist & insurance companies dick  .


When Obamacare came into play the new insurance tried to force suboxone strips on me (utter garbage)

When another new insurance bullshit came around, they tried that again, and then told them if they do not cover my Amneal Buprenorphine Tablet, {they are the closest thing to the original stop - sign orange suboxones} i will no longer use them, did they approve them . 


The pharmacist who has no right to talk to my mother about my medication {i honestly dont mind but jesus christ lol}, is telling her about how Soma will make me ""floaty and high"" (i no longer get my meds there, but i came to pick up my Soma there that one time . ) 
Soma is a joke ,
Flexirl is a joke,
NSAIDs are killing me
The only thing keeping me alive right now is drinking canned pears blended with broccoli through a straw . I can't even eat pussy or suck a dick . I have constant migraines, tension headaches and other migraine, neuralgia pain

Its just become very difficult for me after the Prescription Monitoring Program came into effect

Ive been dehumanized , demoralized, improperly treated, overdosed with various medications passed the daily allotment (i.e. the allotment for a day of Diclofenac is 200mg,,, which they had me on like 800 lol... and they did NOT care that it was burning a hole in my stomach)


Because i have yet to get my MRIs due to pain my Doctor would not write me a script for physical therapy so i could get some temporary pain relief

So now i understand why pain patients turn to heroin

I personally wont be turning to heroin, i have a lot of codeine and dihydrocodeine, but i dont really want to use them . I am trying to do things properly & by the doctor but this is now ongoing 6 years straight of being treated like shit by doctors.

My new primary doctor most likely will prescribe, but what the fuck? Our entire country is just naive . 

By the way - don't believe the overdose statistics on TV. that incorporates numbers of overdose deaths that INCLUDE things like antidepressants. 


i just am fed up . i may begin to use the code/dihydro and see where i get. the codeine i feel will not last long enough. i feel it might work, but not be strong enough.

(and yes, i know all about bupe tolerance, so i would not start a new regime like that without detoxing a little bit . i usually only take 1mg anyways)

Now, when i have pain, or i think about pain, i get overwhelmed with anxiety thinking about it . Its stupid and not fair . 

If the war on drugs was ended Mexico would be more stable because the majority of their income is literally from the sales of drugs to the united states which is why the narcos act as the government . and yea, blablabla",1534389071.0
