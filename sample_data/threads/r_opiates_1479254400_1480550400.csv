Medicaid covered the costs of *alot* of these prescriptions, so Purdue was still making that $10 a pill (or however much they cost legally before 2010), one way or another. Regardless of their intended or unintended use, Purdue got to cash in on every pill sold, so does anyone have any idea how much money they raked in? If you could find a source that directly calculates how many sales were from (suspected) dirty doctors, that would be insanely helpful. Shit, Actavis, KVK, and every other company that manufactures oxy 30's must *still* be making loads of money, knowing full well that their success as a pill is highly supplemented by black market appeal.",1479311492.0

A friend was considering using online classifieds to purchase pills and had texted someone who was offering oxys. I asked if he wasn't at least nervous dealing with a stranger that the seller might not be law enforcement, a la a sting to bust buyers (the borough of the city I'm at has had a vary publicized issue with opiate addiction in the media with public response from the police)? My friend was like ""i just text and ask if they are a cop. they can't lie cause then it would be considered entrapment and the bust wouldn't hold up in court."" Like, he thinks that just asking will protect him from prosecution and that an undercover posing as a seller wouldn't lie. I've always thought it was bullshit and I've always laughed at anyone who asked me if I was a cop (as buyer or seller), like a cop would answer ""Oh you got me..yeah I'm a cop. You're free to continue with our transaction at which point I will have to arrest you or you can go now scott free."" Is there any truth to this notion that by asking ""are you a cop?"" it somehow protects or at least minimizes consequences? Or is this just bullshit as I think it is?

Just got off of work, I work at a hospital and have been talking with a 60 year old patient who is an ex junkie of many many year. We got onto the subject of overdose and he claimed that milk can reverse and OD if injected and I have been arguing with him about it for the longest time because it doesn't make sense to me. He said you need to inject somewhere along the lines of 10 CCs into the victims veins which is just a ridiculous amount of liquid in the first place, on top of it being milk! He had OD approximately a Dozen times and said that his brother revived him with this. 

This got me thinking because someone just the other day posted a video of a couple who overdosed while driving and smashed into a road sign in Detroit (I think) and all the black people were slapping them trying to wake them up and all of use were laughing because one of the ladies in the video said ""does anyone have milk?""

I abused some prior to getting this treatment but I can manage till the 22nd to refill but after some never actually passing a drug test to their standards, and calling their referred addictionologist who rudely declined to vouch for me he said finally told me today this..

Seeing how our records indicate you were on oxycodone and benzodiazepines for the majority of your adulthood, I see no problem as to why you cannot mix these. However I need 2 things from you. You will have to sign a document with a family member as a witness stating if something tragic happens we will not be sued, and a physician who approves the mixture. Which I have step 2 covered at the clinic and even by the 2 counselors. Then calmly said Also, if your current psych won't prescribe them I have a doctor. (blew my mind he said that!) after I told him I might get discharged at the other place. Then he asked if you were to be off the benzos, in your mind how likely would you be to relapse? Which I told him I'm positive if it. Since that's his this all started.

I'm a non-user who's been lurking here for the past few weeks. I've been watching heroin documentaries and stuff for the past few months to gain some knowledge because I'm not very knowledgeable about drugs and my anxiety is too bad for me to try anything. But I'm digressing.

My interest in this stems from my friend who is a current addict. I would love to know how to help her. It would be hard enough to get her away from heroin but for her heroin is a major part of her relationship to this guy who is her first love. She is in an awful toxic relationship with a guy who introduced her to the drug and who treats her like dogshit. She's addicted to heroin and the guy and they both feed into each other.

I want to know how to help her. I've read through a lot of your stories about how you're not ready until you're ready and that there is nothing that anyone can do to force a opiate user to quit. I can totally understand that since it's a bit like trying to get a friend to leave an abusive relationship. I'm just wondering what I can do in the meantime so she realizes I'm here for her and that I care. I also do not want to get taken advantage of emotionally at the same time so I'm really trying to find a good middle ground.

Fucked up post.,"I just have to get this off my chest and I obviously can't just talk to people about this in real life.

So basically I made a post a couple weeks ago how my mom found my shit and told my dad, who ended up asking me for dope and I gave him a bag because he was sick that day.

Well since then we had made a plan to quit together with a sub taper but haven't been able to get the get the time off from work and other shit to make it through the whole induction part. So since then we have been holding it down copping dope for each other so neither of us loses our jobs from being sick and all that shit. 

It's just so fucking weird talking to him about it and planning out getting shit for each other and exchanging connects and all that bull shit. I can tell that even the dboys are like yo this shit is just fucked up. But as fucked up as it is, neither of us has been sick these past 2 weeks or so. And its so nice to get a call telling me that I'm all set for as soon as I get home. 

It's also weird as fuck that on this sub we can all relate to each other in so many ways but I don't think there's any one I can relate to for this situation. 

It feels good to be so open about this to somebody that I love and am so close to. And I really think this is going to help me quit when we get the time to because I'll have some one there with me who understands and is going through the exact same thing. And our openness about all of this will really allow us to be honest with one another and help each other through those bad days when relapse will seem inevitable. 

And he told me the other day that from all of this, for the first time in his life he truly wants to stop because it pretty much breaks his heart to know his son is going through the same thing and he wants to be better to help me get better.

I have a major underlying disease that can't be cured but I had well managed for a while thanks to Humira, or so I thought. 

Middle of the night started throwing up thinking just detoxing. Pain started creeping into the 6s, 7s, 8s, just detoxing I can do do this. Diahreah gets worse no big deal just detoxing I got it.. blood.

My disease is back in full swing and doc tells me this is gonna be painful and surgery is coming a lot sooner than hoped, script is written thinking I'm getting a few percs, friggin Oxy 30s 5 times a day.

Why is Junkie Jesus playing these games with me?

Do I just have a weak batch and need to crush and make more into tea? Like 20+ pods? They are definitely giant... I was quite sure they are sonniferum variety, I don't think you can get giant heads that weren't. Plus, I'm sure I ordered from this site years ago.. 

However, this blanket ban on psychoactives in the UK.. has it touched poppy heads? Have they got a process to 'sterilize' poppy heads before sending them out to customers?

RLS is driving me up the wall, I'm crawling out of my skin and I kinda just want to blow my brains out.
I'm at work currently so I'm trying to keep from going out of my mind... I took a 50 mg tram (too much makes me jittery and my RLS worse) and about 12 mg of lope. It's slightly taking the edge off... I have no trams or lope left though..

Anyway.. I've been wanting to quit for awhile now.. I sink all of my funds into heroin including my familys and they're getting tired of it... I actually got bitched out because the last two checks my grandpa gave me for my bankrupsy I blew on dope and have filed yet... That bad. He doesn't know I'm a user but he is going to know soon if I don't clean up my act and honestly I'm tired of the game and tired of withdraw. 

Some kind redditers are helping me by sending me some green and red kratom but I'm not sure where to begin. I've used kratom before but I did it my SO's way which was creating a tea with lemon and it was just horrible and sat it my stomach. It helped some with the withdraws but the brick feeling in my stomach made me not want to continue using it. I guess my question is, what is the best way to ingest it? Should I just dump a tablespoon in my mouth and wash it down? How much should I take to get rid of withdraw?
I absolutely CANNOT miss anymore work or I'll lose my job. Once I get the kratom I'm going to try to taper with what I have and then start on kratom.

I currently get 1100mg morphine a day (in Germany, sorry guys) and have been off the smack for almost a year. Since this semester started I have been able to take my dose home for the days uni starts too early for me to show up. Every one of those days I used to take only 1000mg or 900 and squirrel the rest away. This went okay for a while but a couple of weeks back I started shooting the morphine. Had super bad histamine reactions and thought well, if I already picked up the needle and it did near to nothing for me why not get the real shit.

So, I shot up morphine 4 times over the course of the last 3 weeks, with about three days in between or more. Now I used smack the day before yesterday, got my morph in the morning and had wd symptoms until 2pm yesterday. Last night I shot up the rest, at 8pm today I got my 1100mg, took an extra 100mg orally after getting up and still am in withdrawal right fn now.  
What I want to do is plan how to use all the shit at my disposal to get back to where I was before, with as little wd's as possible since I have to study and take exams and just don't have time for that crap. 
Those are the facts:
I have to  take 1100 mg morphine orally daily except for upcoming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday when I get to take the dose home. In  fact I get the prescription on Friday so 3x1100mg for those three days will be in my hands Friday night. 
I have to stay off smack bc I definitely will have to take a piss test on Monday. 
I have 5x Pregabalin 150mg (eases symptoms, much like gabapentin) 
7x Promethazin 25mg 
10x Tramadol 10mg (not really useful but it's there.)

If any of you has any idea how to do this, I'd be really grateful for input. I thought of skipping a day or taking only half my dose plus Pregabalin. Or crush the morphine to remove the retardation mechanism and take 300mg in the morning, 200mg during the day and 300mg when I get home. Or something like that. 
I really need to function if I want to pass my exams this semester and I'm so so so pissed off with myself for endangering everything I accomplished. If I'm tested positive I might lose the take home privileges, which would mean Id have to either miss uni or start using on a regular basis again. I did the first semester whilst shooting in secret and it was horrible being so paranoid all the time.  
OK that  last part was just me freaking out.

I'm on suboxone (2mg a day down from 12mg) but I have none left because I left part of my script in a different state while on vacation. So my last dose was a measly .75mg yesterday morning at 7 am, so I started feeling kinda crap but I thought I had a new script today so wasn't feeling too hopeless. Went to the pharmacy and the pharmacist came back and said ""Sor you realize this script is not for a few more days right?"" My heart sank and I started to panic, and mentally made my minor wds worse. So what did I do? Hit up a few of my dboys I haven't picked up from in months. One only does 60 or more and the one who would serve me thought I turned into an informant. After some talking and explaining he finally said alright, so I drove 25 mins to his place and grabbed a point. I had a really old rig that doesn't aspirate well and missed 1/2 of the point in my hand and decided to go buy new rigs instead of waste it. About 5 mins later I felt better, but disappointed. Ended up getting rigs and hitting and to be honest, I don't miss getting high. I hit the rest of the point about 2 hours later and just cooked up the juicy cottons (saved a lot in them because I trust no one and do pretty small shots) 5 mins ago and don't feel high but definitely feel good. Already plan on grabbing another point tomorrow to get through tomorrow and maybe save half for the next day. Dope out here has gotten better and that makes me happy I quit when I did because I was reckless and spending 60-100 every damn day and doing big shots so I probably would've dropped. I don't plan on using after I get back on subs  because I actually like subs better. I like having energy. 

Sorry for the shitpost, but how's everyone's day going? Any copping stories? I love reading those!

Btw if you're wondering I cold turkied on my own decision from a pretty nasty habit, didn't get on subs til a week after I quit dope. Getting clean isn't hard if you want it, and this was my first slip up 4 - 5 months later.",1479351051.0

I dont know how much longer I can put up with this.,"Hi all, I just felt the need to vent and figured this was the most appropriate place to do so. Im 23yrs old and have been an IV opiate user for multiple years (DOC is Dilaudid, Opana IR and dope). Around two years ago, I was kicked out of my parents house and went down to Florida for treatment. I ended up doing the South Florida detox/treatment/halfway shuffle for the entire year and a half I was down there, and was eventually able to get over a month clean in July and August. My parents were happy with my success and allowed me to move back home in the middle of August. After returning home, I started getting the Vivitrol shot, and stayed clean until the beginning of October. I started shooting subs again, because Bupe has a higher binding affinity than naloxone, I was still able to get high. Within a week, I was back to shooting subs, ketamine, Adderall and methadone. At the end of October when my shot began to wear off, I started shooting dope again, and was back to shooting up multiple times a day. This morning, after doing a shot before my mom drove me to class, she noticed my pinned pupils and decided to UA me. I obviously popped dirty and thats when shit hit the fan like back in the old days before my first treatment. Now, I may be getting kicked out of my house again, but this time my parents aren't going to help me financially, so I have no way to even get in to treatment or get to Florida. I dont have a car, or anywhere to go, so if they decide to give me the boot, Im literally on the streets. 
     However, the problem I've illustrated above isn't even the worst part. At the beginning of this semester, I met a girl in one of my classes. We hit it off right away and began hanging out daily and have gone on a few dates. She is seriously perfect in every way, sweet, cute, funny, and unfortunately, my main using buddy. Recently I have come to realize that I am in love with her. When she isn't around, I miss her. When we talk on the phone, I LOVE hearing the sound of her voice. So heres the problem, which could play out in one of two scenarios; A) I get sent down to Florida and am never able to see her again, and; B) My parents took my phone and looked through it and found out that she uses with me. They said if I even want a chance of not being kicked out, then I can never contact her again. Remember, I have no car, and if I am able to stay with my parents, my stay at home mom will not even let me out of her sight, so theres no way I can sneak out to see her. 
     I am seriously afraid. She means more to me than anything in my life and I would be absolutely devastated if I were to never see her again. The only thing motivating me to get clean is being able to stay with my parents, and if I do, I still wont be able to see her. So I really see no reason to get clean, or even to live anymore. I am contemplating suicide, and while I dont think I could bring myself to shoot myself, or jump in front of a train, I could see myself doing a lethal shot and nodding off peacefully into the eternal abyss. I really dont know what to do; I feel hopeless. Maybe some of you could offer some kind words or advice, because death really seems like the best option right now. ",1479343091.0

I know CWE doesn't normally remove Apsirin, specifically, I did an alternative method involving a much tighter filter and forcing the liquid through a syringe to actually separate the codeine.

So I've recently quit drinking and I'm really hurting for some kind of downer and it's the only thing in the house that isn't liquor. So I go dig it out of the cupboard and the formerly clear liquid has taken on a subtle pinkish hue, and I was wondering what exactly this means?

My first impression is that the colour change is indicative of some sort of chemical reaction that changed the codeine and will either make it completely ineffective or dangerous to drink. Either way no good, and so I'd love to be wrong about this.

And if it has turned, does anybody know what's actually happened to its chemistry to make that colour change?

This is always one of my favorite aspects of the show,"The character of Donald Ressler is a stereotypical, douchebag cop, however at the beginning of season 2 he is seen taking hydrocodones and breaks his hand to get more of them. He loses them in one episode and when they are recovered he fesses up that they're his and he's in withdrawal. He supposedly got clean but another character makes reference to him ""popping oxys""

The truth is, if you really watch the Blacklist you know he never stopped. He loved the opiate high because it made him feel blissful and like everything would be ok when life got stressful at work and hardships ruled his life. Like losing Audrey. He loved that he could be feeling like he was about to cry about her but then he could pop a little blue pill that made him feel high and apathetic. 

Although it is implied in one episode he's clean, just watch the show, he's not. He's probably limiting his intake, he still appears pseudo fucked up at work but is able to get his work done when he needs to. As an addict I can tell you exactly what's going on there. I can tell the writers did it on purpose because he's going to get very addicted again in some future episodes, maybe to heroin this time.

I honestly hated the guy at first but having watched the show a lot more I just love that he does opiates and doesn't give a fuck. They work to take HIS pain away and that's really all that matters.",1479321425.0

Please be careful,"This is my first Reddit post, and I wanted to share my story. I'm in my mid-twenties and have been an addict since I was 11 years old. Started off with Lortabs and low-dose pain medication, eventually leading to oxy, and eventually heroin. Long story short, at the peak of my heroin addiction I would inject anywhere between a gram and 5 grams a Day, nodding in and out of consciousness and enjoying every minute. Fentanyl is a huge problem in my city, we average 8 to 15 overdose a day and I have lost more people than I can count this year alone, and yet I continued to use, I actually preferred the fentanyl dope. I remember one day I was at the dope mans house getting my fix and a friend of mine ran in and said to the d man you might want to get out of here bro, so and so is dead we gotta call 911, and that made me want the dope even more, I knew it was fire. Keep in mind I had an extremely high tolerance. A few weeks later when I went to cop I was hurting for cash and could only afford one bag. 20 dollars. Maybe a tenth of a gram. I went to a gas station ready to get ""better"".  little did I know that this would be the last time Id ever stick a needle in my body. I hit it with water, filtered it, drew it up. 40 units of liquid is what I used. I hit a vein and started to inject it.

Then I woke up, shirt cut off me laying in the parking lot. I had an IV in my arm and was hooked up to some machine. There were paramedics, police officers and detectives standing over me. My mouth was so dry my tongue was like velcro stuck to the bottom of my mouth, when I was able to speak, still laying there , I asked what happened. The detective responded ""you were fucking dead dude, do you understand that, you were Fucking dead, how much heroin did you do?"" My phone is about to die and I want to finish this post, so I'm going to wrap this up real quick. Well I purchased was not heroin, it was carfentanil.  they informed me that I was given 6 2 milligram doses of narcan, and when they found me the needle was still in my arm with 32 units of liquid in it. I've done several grams of fentanyl dope in a matter of hours, and a quarter of a 20$ bag stopped my breathing. I've been sober since. So to those of you still using, know what it is that you're buying, and please be careful. Had a stranger not seen me slumped over in my car, I wouldn't be here to warn you. Please be careful guys, life can end in the blink of an eye.

What happens if I do drink and take it?",1479319436.0

So i gave it the Ol' college try and me thinks im gonna just stick to putting my dope up my noise and up my butt. I would still like to report on my experience with smoking it though. So i decided to just use one of the remaining bags I had left, and one stamp bag is not a lot of product. I quickly realized that in order to effectively catch a nice buzz from smoking that i would probably need to put at least 3 bags worth of dope on the foil, and when snorting 1 or 2 bags at a time puts me where i wanna be i cant picture using 3 bags at a time. Now, while i found it more of a hassle instead of an enjoyment trying to smoke my single stamp of powder, i could totally see myself chasing a big ball of tar or fat rock of raw off foil....but trying to do it with loose, light, powdery dust proved to be a challenge. The powder was a bitch to try and keep together on the foil. Anytime i moved the foil with my shaky hands the powder was jumping all over the place.
To u/blondinium who said i ""could not smoke ECP bc its #4"" (whatever nonsense that even meant), i would just like to say you most certainly can smoke ECP just fine i only suggest using more dolid material when doing so.....Myth ""BuStEd""!  Once i did have all the dope in one spot on the foil i lit my lighter and had the flame VERY far from the foil, but the dope did not require much heat b4 it began to smoke. I had the foil tilted at a 45° angle and the powder went like this; off white powder-->amber colored viscous liquid-->maple syrup goo-->black charred ash in an instant. I was able to catch all the smoke that was made however, my tiny single stamp of powder was simply not enough dope to get a nice chief of smoke off of. I honestly could barely tell i had inhaled anything...so yeah thats my report on my experience trying to smoke a single stamp bag of ECP#666. Sorry my 5min long experiment took you 20min to read lol....but after my unsuccessful   & futile attempt trying to chase the dragon went south I ended up tooting 2 bags and boofing 2 bags back to back so typing this while nodding in and out of conciousnes was a bitch bc i had to keep deleting the long trail of nonsense numbers and letters, refer back to what the fuck i was typing about,  make sure i wasn't repeating shit over and over, and bc im a bit of a perfectionist fix all the spelling and grammar errors. 
TL;dr Today i tried smoking a SINGLE stamp bag of dope, quickly learned i either need alot of powder or more solid product like tar or a rock of raw. Decided i will just stick to tootin & boofin my dope.",1479318383.0

So my kinda boyfriend (I'll just refer to him as my bf here) is my middle man. I mostly make our dope money by selling sexy/naked pictures/videos, I post ads on CL in the other side of the country and make/send the content on kik. My bf is chill with this because sometimes he even gets to participate when the customers want that. So we made 80$ today. He picks up from the homeless camp about a mile from where I live. So when he came back today from picking up he told me something. 

The guy down there was curious how we make our dope money and my bf told him. The guy is really interested and would pay us 3 grams of tar to watch us have sex in his tent on his mattress. The bf told me he said he knows he can't touch and that he agreed he wouldn't try to narrate or otherwise be extra creeper during it. My bf told him that he's not sure how I would feel about it but he'll ask me. So yeah. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm already fucking him so that's not a problem at all to me. The thing that makes me iffy is that he's so close to home. Not that he would learn where I live from seeing me get fucked but hopefully you know what I mean. I can wear a wig (I have a nice collection of wigs) and a mask over the top part of my face and take out my identifying piercings and wear heavy make up. 

What do you guys think? Anyone ever done this before? What would you do? Do you think it's worth it? If I go through with it so you think I should ask for more dope? I have a few days to decide so yeah. Any input appreciated. Love you guys!

So after my other thread that I started discussing these pills I came into contact with I might think are fake, I need some more advice. I wanted to start a new thread so that it could get out to even more people and no one would be confused that I have new information.

*New Developments*

I have noticed that whenever these pills touch any sort of liquid, they turn YELLOW. At first I tested this with my tongue and was freaked the fuck out, then I tried it with my finger tip touching water and smearing the back of the pill.

Picture Proof: http://imgur.com/a/eUans

What the fuck? Has anyone ever seen something like this? Why would it turn yellow. If anyone has an A|51 tablet that they have received from the pharmacy they could try this on, I would really appreciate it. This looks like some sort of chemical reaction, I don't get it.

Here are the other pictures of the pills I took in better lighting.

Turns out the stuff didn't work. We went to plug everything in and test it and nothing.  It doesn't use mains power so I couldn't just plug it in and test when I actually posted the fucking listing but it all **did** work when I stored it.

Context of this is regular coke use, but I don't plan to take oxys while still on it, I wanna experience it 'pure'.

The reason why I'm asking about things 'similar' to oxycodone/Oxycontin is because it seems to be quite hard to obtain in the U.K., at least for me, which seems to follow the general pattern of widespread + easily accessible pharmaceuticals use in the US vs Coke and MD in the U.K. 

Are there any more commonly sold alternatives, maybe under different names like hydrocodone- or in different pills?
I'm just wondering what the most commonly used opiate pills are , or your experiences with oxys and if they live up to what people say.
I have a pretty low opiate tolerance though, due to me only mainly having PST but obviously it varies depending on the batch of seeds :)

Although the clientele has thinned out considerably since then, there was a time when I was bringing in $400-600 every 5-7 days or so, asking very little in return (.2-3 each middle deal 3-5g ea) and I was fine with that. He knows I work full time with a decent salary and oh yeah, he knows where I live :-) - he'd just fronted me a $40 for like 10 days after I explained my now ex gf (that's another and considerably longer story) had just had me line up a $100 bag for her and refused to give me even a little of it (living w/ me two months and $1k behind in rent/bills) and I was pissed off and broke. I figured that dropping in on his hotel at 8pm asking for a front for a mere 12ish hours would be OK. Although in the end it was OK, he gave me a $50 after I promised to be by in the morning with his cash, he was grumpy and with a girl (clothed so I didn't catch them in the act, but still...) with him in the room it made things that much worse. I fetched some Gatorade for him around the corner and then got the hell outta there.

Anyway, it's the next day, I paid him back around 10am, didn't get more than an hour or two of sleep, but I picked up even more dope and am at least comfortable and have put down the meth for now..  dboy sent a mass text explaining no more drop ins (*cough* oops), but told me to meet up after work, as I got the bare minimum for my morning purchase, since he was dangerously low on product. I'm going back to suboxone and trying to pick up the shattered pieces of my life. I had to break it off w my gf of two years, changed the locks and am now done with being irresponsible to numb the pain (for now...) of living. I'm back at the office, on my lunch break, having a post-foil cig and eagerly awaiting 5PM and my comfy, but lonely couch. Remember kids; if you're going to do meth in any noticeable quantity, ALWAYS have a parachute, or you'll end up walking 45 minutes to a shady extended stay, half begging your dboy for a few points until you can get a new debit card. 

TL:DR: picked up BTH + meth on payday, used all BTH before meth was gone and ended up with nothing to take the edge off for most of the work day, was scolded by dboy for showing up unannounced, asking for a front. ",1479414228.0

I am prescribed 20 mg of Celexa daily for anxiety and depression. I've been anxious since I was 13 years old, and I am 19 now. Depression didn't come around until about four months.

I've been dabbling infrequently in opiates for two years, ever since I got my first set of wisdom teeth out and was prescribed hydrocodone. Just 10 mg of Vicodin entranced me in a bliss of euphoria and calmness. I wasn't on any antidepressants at the time.

Before being put on Celexa last month, I would take 30 mg of oxycodone probably three times a month, always spaced out by about at least a week and a half, and skipping some months altogether. Always had a very enjoyable high, and indescribable euphoria.

After taking 20 mg of Celexa daily for a month, and not having any opiates in that period, I took 20 mg of oxycodone orally with no tolerance, waited an hour, and felt almost nothing. I then took another 20 mg and felt just a very mild mood lift.

Have any of you noticed this effect with SSRIs as well? I know about the interactions opiates have with most medications, but it's pretty difficult to qualify lack of euphoria as an interaction. 

I just wanted to see if any of you have had a similar experience on SSRIs, thank you for your input!",1479400825.0

People have used it for thousands (if not tens of thousands) of years for physical pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, coughs, hypertension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and fatigue among other things. Many veterans use kratom to help with PTSD. Countless people have used it to help break their alcohol or opiate addiction. Kratom has saved many lives in this way. 

In lower doses it's stimulating like caffeine and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It does not cause significant or any respiratory depression and is not a hallucinogen. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million by the AKA) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000 estimated by the BEA) American kratom small businesses.

The DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which were undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety not danger. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin which is beyond absurd and frankly insane. 

After the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom. You can read the thousands of personal testimonials from people who use kratom there. 

As an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that ""Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents."" The Florida Department of Health added that, ""there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida."" 

If you would like to do something about this issue then you can sign the Whitehouse.gov [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance)(complete) and Action Network [petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/do-not-place-kratom-on-the-schedule-substance-list?source=gplus). The [American Kratom Association](http://www.americankratom.org/) and the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/) are the two main advocacy groups. You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/SenateKratomLetterFinal.pdf) to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/9.29.16LettertoDEAonKratomEmergencySchedulingFinalSigne1.pdf) which has 3 signatures.

You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact).

If you have personal experience (not required) with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/). The deadline to comment is December 1st. 

It would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this.

I gave my life to heroin, no matter what was going on, heroin told me it was going to be okay. Most of us know what heroin feels like so I'm going to skip over why I have such love for it. I finally got clean back in may, two days away from my five months I was cleaning some shit up for my grandma since she can barley walk anymore. Stumbled upon a old script from 2013 of 40, 20 mg oxycodone's. I took them home. I had one ready to rail and 3 in my hand to eat. I paced back and forth back and forth staring at this line. Finally decide to call my sponsor even though I knew he wouldn't be happy, but understating. I forgot to pay my phone bill. And 3 days later im out. I knew, if I kept up with opiates one week from that day I would have that needle back in my arm. And that scared the fuck outta me. I haven't touched any opiate since.

I started using my second DOC meth. Yesterday a good friend I went through treatment with, said she started using again on occasion, she got some strange looking dope, its been awhile, she wasn't tryna shoot it alone in case she fell out. I told her to come over I'd make sure she would be fine. I told her not to offer me any, while I was still sober, as I knew my spun out self would like a nice shot, she never offered, thank god. I watched her and it drove me insane. Just the whole act, loading the shot, looking for her vein, checking if she hit etc etc. I missed it so much, my pipe never left my lips until she left, every minute I spent focusing on my pipe was one minute I didn't have to see how happy she was. That look on her face after every shot she took. Nodding out without a care in the world. I woke up this morning not craving a hit from my pipe, but instead a nice shot of h. 

Its been on my mind all day. I keep thinking just one time, what's that gonna hurt? Ill escape for a couple hours. Remember that rush after you pull that needle out, no rush beats that, don't you want to relive that? Its been so long since I've shot, I bet I'd get a wicked buzz. Its goes on and on. I want to more then anything, but I know this drug is like none other. I love it more then any other drug. From the first time she hit my vines, her lust was great for that one night, but I fell in love. 

I hate this drug because of how much I love it. I lost so many friends over the years, I lost my life for years to it, and I still crave it. That is how powerful heroin is. If you are thinking about trying it just don't do it, its not worth it. Hopefully I don't have these cravings again tomorrow. I'm trying my hardest not to go back. I didn't really have a friend to share this with. So why not this sub? Thanks reading the ramble.

Definitely retarded especially since I'm actually making a huge effort to get clean for good - in the span of like 13 months opoids have destroyed my life - definitely haven't hit rock bottom but I've made no progress in the past 13 months - and holy fuck have I regressed. Suffice to say rock bottom is in sight if I don't smarten the fuck up.

Anyways so I got on subs a few days ago. Also to preface - before today I've never IV'd in my life.

My last dose of subs was 8mg say 20 hours since I decided to try to ""breakthrough"" with 3 points of some heroin cut with some fent.

I smoked and snorted about half - my normal ROA. I didn't feel much at all so I decided it was time to try to IV so see if that would help break the bupe wall. I paid some junkie 5 bucks and a hoot of smack to go get me a safe injection kit from the exchange since I was to embarrassed to go myself.

Anyways I ended IV'ing heroin and we'll my first drug. It wasn't to difficult tho successfully hitting a vein and getting blood is alot more difficult than anticipated (any tips? While we're at it). Also found that once you find a good vein it's hard to do other veins as I've failed in like all but 2 veins with 1 being the main receiver. Of course this is far from ideal as I know one should rotate vein.

Anyways after all was said and done and the 3pts of smack in my system via smoke/snort/IV the suboxone did it's job and I barely felt the dope at all. I snorted the last of my dope about 22 hrs since my 8mg sub dose.

Well that's honestly for the best - I need to stay off opiates or my life will literally be ruined, I'm sure I don't need to elaborate there more. I was going to do a fast agressive taper from subs but I think I might stay on it for a few months until I got my shit more under control.

Anyways, having learned to IV I wanted to experience a drug IV, what better drug than good old coke? Maybe I'd experience the ever talked about ""bell ringer"".

Well I bought a $40 bag from my trusted coke guy - and did shots. Admittedly small to play it safe. My 2nd shot being bigger but nothing crazy. Well I was sort of disappointed but to he far I didn't do huge amounts, and I am on 8mg subs (dosed nearly 24 hrs ago), 3 pts of smack and 2.25mg of xanax. So all that could be dulling the effect.

Well with all that said I'll probably finish IVing the rest of my coke but after that I plan to never pick up the needle, never touch opiates again. And well I never had a problem with coke everyonce in a while socially at the club or whatnot. But I am came fucking awful close to rock bottom and I intend to begin building my life back up.

Like I know I'll be an addict the rest of my life, but this just feels like the manifestation of that.

This involves customers providing money to one individual, while the other individual serves product out of a charity lemonade stand. BUYERS will meet the MONEY MAN and provide money (-$1) in an envelope under the guise of providing donations for Limbs for Life, a real non-profit for prosthetics (in case 5-0 Google it). MONEY MAN will provide directions to the day's lemonade stand spot. Buyer will provide remaining $1 to PRODUCT MAN and receive product in an opaque cup, the same that lemonade is being sold in. For those planning on pocketing their drugs as soon as possible, there will be a trash can situated nearby for the cups (which would be emptied once a day).

--

BUYER:

- Alibi is that they joined Limbs for Life at a booth they saw at the mall (in the middle of a huge awareness campaign, explaining the surge in donations).

- The point of the job is to go to peoples' houses and make sure they actually donate (just like political campaigns do for contributions) .. It is scheduled beforehand on the phone, often view cold call.

- Buyer will carry map of (fake) contributors' addresses in car as to have evidence of legitimate reason to be in neighborhood.

- ""Reasoning"" for volunteering is that it Looks good on a resume AND you get paid .60¢ a mile. *If you drive 30 miles in an hour, spending $3 on gas, you're looking at $15 an hour.*

- If dropping off less than $150, explain to cops that it was not a productive day, or people weren't home

- Will pay Money Man via envelope

- Buyers will exclude $1 from the purchase envelope

- Buyer will be given a map of locations to stop at for ""tomorrow.""

--

MONEY MAN:

- Will receive envelope and provide new map to customer, as well as today's lemonade stand location

- Money man will Will receive money ONLY in safe places

- Money man will change map of contributors' addresses daily

- Money man will page Product Man money amount.

- Burners may be used but must be tossed every day.

- Trusted associate may be required for muscle to take money away.

--

PRODUCT MAN:

- Product man receive $1 from buyer, go under desk to deposit money and receive product. Will put product in cup and give to buyer.

- Cups will be as generic as possible.

- Actual lemonade will be present and sold, as well as snacks.

- There will be a functioning register or money box,

- Lemonade stand will change locations to avoid traffic, suspicion, and potential robbery. Lemonade stand may likely travel far distances within the city or neighborhood, as customers are expected to have cars.

- Lemonade stand may explain pager or cell phone as being associated with Limbs for Life.

- Moving to experiment with different areas for donations.

- Lemonade stand may explain changed locations as testing different markets.

- Stand will never carry too much product, and fake lemons in bags of real lemons, sugar boxes, etc. will contain pre-packaged product.

- Trusted associated will be occasionally required for re-stock.

- Product is kept in hidden, chained safe. If cops bust stand, Product Man can explain that only the stand owner knows the combo.

5dpsdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5dpsdz/help_question_about_suboxone/,14,https://redd.it/5dpsdz,acuteliljunkie,Help/ Question about suboxone,"Ok so I am trying to get into a detox/rehab facility, but almost all the places Ive called only do a suboxone detox. Let me explain a little bit more about myself before I ask my questions...

~ I have been an IV H user for the past 6 years and was sniffing 3 years before that. Ive been to rehab/detox about 13 times. Ive tried halfway houses, moving far away to different states, changing people places & things, suboxone maintenance, and I cant seem to stay clean for the life of me! Longest Ive had clean was 6 months and I was on suboxone the whole time, and that was about 4 years ago when my tolerance was much lower. I now do a bun in 1 shot about 3-4x a day. Ive been to jail, Ive almost lost both my arms due to using a dirty rig, Ive lost family, friends, Ive been homeless, etc... (you know how addiction works...) I think its time that I give detox/ rehab another chance. No, Im not at that point where its like ""I need to get clean or I'll die"" and no I havent had that ""spiritual awakening"" where I realize I need to get my shit together. Tbh I dont even know if Im really ready to get clean, but I know I need to atleast try. Shit who doesn't love getting ripped?! Its like I WANT to wanna be clean. Its like I have no hope for myself so why bother? Does that make any sense? ~


Anyway, I went to a detox about a month ago for a week or so. It was a suboxone detox and this is the first time going back for treatment in almost 3 years. I waited I think about 18hrs and took my first 8mg sub. I was super sick still and wanted to die. As the days went on, I kept taking the subs but was still sick as crap but I toughed the week out and completed detox. I relapsed to say the least. Then I went to another detox 2-3 weeks later and it was a suboxone detox again. I thought that maybe I had taken the sub too soon or that 8mg just wasn't enough. So this time, I snuck my own subs in and waited more than 24hrs and then took 2 8mg sub strips. Was still terribly ill the entire time. Im talking like did NOT make any of the withdrawal symptoms subside. I was still in FULL BLOWN W/D the whole detox. I can still remember me sitting in the shower in the fetal position with the heat on my legs and back just crying in pain for a good 3hrs. Didnt sleep for days or eat/drink barely anything. Restless legs, hot and cold, sweats n chills, you know the drill. Oh it was so awful...

I have recently found a rehab that does either Subutex or a Methadone detox to get off H. Never been there before but Ive been reading reviews online and it doesnt seem like a very good place (people sneaking drugs in, girls and boys having sex, people stealing other peoples clothes, therapists arent good, workers arent very nice, etc.) but oh well. It is what you make of it, I think anyway. Very nervous about going but I really should go... Ive been doing this shit for way too long. Dont get me wrong I l0o0ve H but I gotta give this shit a shot...


---> So my questions are:  
1.) Does anyone else have this problem with suboxone? Some people think Im absolutely insane when I tell them suboxone doesn't work for me. Which is weird because it use to 3 years ago (lower tolerance at the time tho.) 


2.) Is Subutex any different than Suboxone? If so, how? (besides not having the blocker) 


3.) Should I choose Subutex or Methadone detox taper? Why?


Any feedback would be great! I really need some help deciding what I should do. Id really like to know if anyone else has this problem with Suboxone, and/or also feeling like their not ready to get clean but should atleast try... 


Thanks xx

Well I'm working and it hits me my throat gets swollen my ears start to itch and I can't breath what so ever. I'm trying to hard not to cry because my anxiety is through the roof and everyone is looking at me like I'm fucking crazy . Well anyways I'm turning blue at this point and my managers call an ambulance to come give me oxygen- it doesn't work so they rush my to the emergency room at the hospital only a few min away (thank goodness I work downtown). It takes the lung doctors about an hour for me to finally catch my breath they hook me up to all these machines and shit. I have this huge mask on my face blowing this breathing treatment in my lungs they had to give me five of these back to back. Meanwhile the entire time I am breathing in my nose and out my mouth just trying to stay calm focusing on breathing properly it's so hard and hurts so bad. At this point they put me to sleep and let my body and lungs rest and hooked me to a lung matching that opens them up. And the breathing machine did all the work. So exhausting ! I get off that machine and they make me stay another day- while every hour getting breathing treatments and no sleep. At this point I'm in withdraws because I haven't dosed since Wednesday morning 😕 I just got home an hour ago after I refused to stay another day because I had been breathing on my own for 24 hrs with the treatments . I just couldn't stay and I didn't want to tell them I had an opiate problem and was in withdraws. It was hell. But I hope all of you are well! My significant other went to Colorado the day I went in the hospital I told him not to go he knew where I wAs but went anyways that was disappointing but I also didn't want him to miss out on this trip. Althoug it was unexpected and he doesn't have to pay a thing, it's not like he is losing money but whatever . Just had to vent and share with you all. I'm scared I have to start seeing a lung specialist, the doctor who took care of me these past few days so that's nice he knows my case and what not. Everyone stay safe ! Not being able to breath is the scariest feeling in the world :( ",1479503789.0

**big note in this story: poor, uninsured** 
Have a massive rod in my leg, arthritis, permanent pain patient. Was on tramadol for 7 years. Used to be on oxy for breakthrough pain but my doctor pulled me until I can get an updated MRI to avoid red flag folder. Last week had 2 seizures from tram. 

Ok so the hospital last week pulls me of tram and sends me home with short supply of oxy. My doctor sees my tox report from in the hospital and sees opiates in it which won't come up for tram. And he says he can't write me oxy. The oxy was in my blood because I just got scripted oxy for my wisdom teeth 2 weeks ago, NOT because I've been using. He's telling me that the dea is up his ass an he can send me to a great PM clinic but that's all he can do for me for now. 

This is so fucked. I'm starting a new job, trying to get on my feet, limping in pain and feeling sick from abruptly stopping the meds. I'm two seconds from calling my dboy. Is this what they fucking want people to do? 

Fuck this shit. 

Edit: I don't ditch this doctor cause he is a family friend who sees me for the same $20 copay he gets from people with insurance and that's all he charges me. ",1479495714.0

Just wanted to give back to the community for all the times I've frantically searched ""drug test"", ""drug test urine"" ""48 hr clean"" etc. haha.  I will also include dates for others who find this thread months from now so it can be of help to them.

Anyway, I'd consider myself to have an average to below average metabolism (tough to lose weight) and I am 5'8 and weigh 160.  I had been using ~90mg oxy insuffilated for a week, went super hard on the weekend ~150mg/day, and then Monday 11/14 I took my last ""taper dose"" of 45mg throughout the day with my last 15mg dose at 10pm ET.  

I suffered some minor w/d which killed my appetite, but other than eating very light (bananas, oatmeal, plain pasta). I drank a FUCK TON of water on Tuesday/Weds and hit the steam room at my gym for 20-30 min.

I went to the lab Thursday and dropped piss around 5pmET.  Just got the results back that they passed!!  Super pumped because I need this to go through with a Kidney donation for a loved one (I know I shouldn't have been playing with fire and cutting it too close from the start...)

TLDR:  Last oxy dose monday 10pm...urine test 5pm Thrusday (less than 72 hrs) and PASSED!

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor or medical professional and obviously each person's metabolism and body time will rid certain chemicals more rapidly than others.  Keep that in mind.  

Have a great weekend!

I hope this doesn't come across like I'm bragging. I'm just so excited with how things fell in to place and I'm really thankful and appreciative.

That heavy body feeling I've never quite found with heroin, the low cost and availability. I even quite like the slow come up. Never shot heroin but dunno if I'd like it as much, would freak me out going from 0 - 100 instantly. I guess when I'm sick it's a bit of a pain to have to chug some tea and wait for it to kick in, but it's usually only 15 - 20 minutes to start feeling the effects.

I am very tempted to buy one 40mg Oxycontin pill from a DNM vendor. The vendor claims the pill can be cut in half for two 20mg doses. They then can then be left to soak in root beer/coca cola over night to beat the time release mechanism,by the morning they'll be good to go.



I guess even if the time release mechanism isn't 100% bypassed 20mg somewhat ER will still eventually get me nodding (im pretty sensitive and purposely limit my use for this exact reason)



Is there any truth to this madness? The reviews seem to be all pretty good there are also a few other vendors selling extended release Oxy pills even up to 80mg, so there has to be a reason right?

So my story starts with my pre-work break. I work in Manhattan and went to Two Bros (dollar pizza) with my co-worker before work started. While we were in the line, the guy before me starts complaining to the counter guy; He's telling him that he's poor and homeless and the slice he gave him was the smallest one they had (and it was a small slice compared to the rest). The counter guy doesn't budge, no sympathy, ""you paid a dollar, you get a slice..that's it"". The homeless man leaves in a fury, yelling at the guy. While that was all happening, in what felt like a flash of a second I remembered all of the shitty moments I had in the worst parts of my addiction. All of the times I was broke because all of my money went to drugs, and all the nights that even though I was high, I was still starving with no money to save me. And I can at least acknowledge that if it wasn't for my parents, I would of been homeless. So in that split second, I change my order of two slices to three slices; all three dollars I had. I grab the pizza and run up the block to catch the guy. He was a little skittish when I first approached him, but I quickly explained that I know what it's like to be hungry and be down on hard times. I gave him a slice and told him that I understand and I'm sorry; He started to cry. He thanked me and gave me his appreciation....but that stuck with me. THIS POOR FUCKING GUY WAS BROUGHT TO TEARS OVER A DOLLAR SLICE. HOW LITTLE COMPASSION DO PEOPLE HAVE THAT THIS POOR GUY IS THAT THANKFUL OVER SOMETHING THAT SMALL? Almost anyone could have afforded that same small act of generosity, but no one else around us cared. 

But that brings us to later in the night. Let me preface this with, over the last year, I haven't really had a romantic life and maybe have gotten laid like three times at most (very, very uncommon compared to the five or so years before it). I work as a server in this restaurant and I get a table with these two gorgeous, extremely nice chicks. When I had the down time I would go over to them and talk them up since they were nice and entertaining. At one point I brought them a dessert on me and told them thank you for being awesome customers. yadda yadda yadda, they settle up with me, and as they're walking out one of them (that I had kind of been eyeing all night but was just like ""yeah, way out of my league"") says ""good night"" but gives me these total dreamy, sexy eyes look at me...to the point where my co-worker from earlier was like ""dude, what was THAT""? I turned to him and was like, ""No way, there's like a 10% chance she left me her number...I doubt it"". I walk over to the table, and lo and behold, written on her check "" I hope this isn't too forward xxx-xxx-xxxx"". My god damn mind was blown. Fast foward, she came back a bit later, we got to talk a bit more, I waited with her for the Uber she called, and now we have a date this next tuesday. WHAT!?!

So with all of this being said, maybe it was karma for an honest act of kindness....or maybe it was junkie Jesus looking down on my sorry ass and thought I could maybe use a fucking break from all the bullshit. Either way, yay!",1479624791.0

Mine:

Me and a buddy were walking from our dboy's place and he was looking for a place to fix (dboy's mom was home or something). Well we pass a basketball court with dudes playing and there's a little bathroom thing to the side. He goes in to do his thing (I don't shoot) and, evidently, when he started to rush, he squatted down to gather himself and promptly avalanched a metric shitload (heh) of liquid embarrassment all into his pants. 

Now, the bathroom has no running water and the toilet looked like a sarcophagus **full** of ancient, brown mummies and smatterings of toilet paper to the point as to be unusable and so he doesn't know *what* the fuck to do now. We still have to walk about a mile home to boot.

Currently though, I don't *know* that this has transpired. I just see him come out of the bathroom slightly pinch-assed muttering under his breath in *urgent as fuck* tones that we need to get the **fuck** out of here that he just shit the fourth teletubby into his pants and that it was making it's way down his pants leg.

We *did* manage to get far enough away from the guys playing that it was safe for him to liberate his excreta into some hedges but to this day I haven't laughed so hard as I did that afternoon.",1479614315.0

how exactly is the high off heroin compared to shit like oxys, hydros, etc? I'm not saying I'm going to start shooting up because I have personal vows regarding that. anyway, onto my questions


1) is it easy to overdose?

2) how can you tell the purity of what you're getting?

3) what's this fent shit I'm hearing about?

4) how long does the high last? ie: smoking, shooting, and snorting

5) is it smokable? if so, what are preparation methods and how high would you get?

6) can you simply eye the shit and assume that's enough to get you high without ODing?

like I said. not too experienced and have no immediate plans for doing H. it's just something that always fascinated me with how it can destroy someone's life with just a small bag and I'm kind of in the dark. I'm more of a dissociative type of guy (shoutout my k-heads and dextronauts)

Recently bought some opiates on a DNM sold as 120mg OxyContin from Mundipharma. I should have been more wary, as they were significantly cheaper than any other more familiar opiates on the site, but I took a chance and bought a few.

They suck. I don't know exactly how to describe it but the buzz isn't anywhere near as strong. I nod a little bit and get a little itchy but overall the euphoria and body high I'm used to from percs, vics, and codeine syrup just isn't there.

I found a suspiciously small amount of info on these pills online -- Mundipharma lists 10, 20, 40, and 80mg caps on their site, but no 120mg. But these appear to be legit (can include a pic if interested), with coating, stamp, etc.

Does anybody have experience here? I.e. does anyone know why they don't feel as good as traditional, more expensive opiates? If so, is there a way to ""unlock"" them (other than peeling off coating/chewing - tried that)? I still have a few and nobody I bought them with is really interested in them at this point...

I let it fuck my head up too much, I've always had this feeling of being disconnected from reality and just being alive weirds me out, I constantly question every aspect of it. The two things that make me forget about that and just accept it for what it is are drugs and women. Heroin and heroines. I always feel alone, a girl cures that with her presence and opiates cure it with allowing me to not give a fuck. So of course I relapse after we break up, weed and alcohol didn't cut it for me anymore, I needed the sweet embrace of my oldest lover, diacetylmorphine. I fucked shit up this time, stole damn near a grand from my great-aunt while she was in the hospital with a broken leg.

If you get a pill that you *know* is legit (try getting one of each traditional Oxy 30mg and 15mg manufacturer), weigh it on a scale or perhaps look up the weight online. Even if they're the same size,  counterfeits won't weigh *exactly* as much as a real Oxy, since there'S different active and inactive ingredients.

--

If the pill checks out in the weight test, you can *maybe* take it a step further. This may take some will power (although a lot of people cop before they run out, so maybe not), but if you keep an authentic oxy or 2 always on hand, you can compare bumps of legit vs. bumps of whatever pills are in your new pick up. They should both taste the same, because they should both have the same fillers.

The second method seems a little excessive and unnecessary, but I figured weighing pills out might do some users some good. Happy nods and a safe weekend to all !",1479593247.0

The focus here is people who have done a good deal of damage to their life, but cant stop using because its the only way they can still feel ok enough to continue. This wont really pertain to people on meds for pain issues(maybe).

  So really quitting opiates means you need to understand why you take them in the first place. You need to figure out what drives you to do heroin or other opiates. The quick and simple answer is, it gives you something you wouldnt otherwise have. It makes you feel good. It makes you feel better about where and what you are. It gives you a positive outlook. It makes you feel like you are, or can be successful. In short, it makes you feel the way a normal happy person does when their lives are going well, and are succesfull. IE happy with job, good looking happy wife/husband, Vacations, new relationships. 

 You take drugs because you feel sad, because you feel alone. You take drugs because you lack success in your life, becuase you lack a good community. Maybe you dont like who or where you are.

Now that we know why, you can begin to make a real path towards getting away from what has now become your life. You need a plan. You need to feel success, but most importantly you need to understand that its going to take time, and that little changes over a long time become huge differences. So make plans, make little consistant plans. Go running every day,  or workout. Get prepared to go to college. Make efforts to meet new people. Make baby steps at first.



For a lot of us exercise is one of the best choices, it allows consistent success and a general sense of well being.

Just remember, you cant just quit. You need to understand why you used, and how you resolve it.

good luck

I'm supposed to drop out of bed, then stumble down to the kitchen, THEN feel great. It's weird waking up not sick, not having to get well. I've craving decently, but not as bad as I thought I would be. because of this....

the last like, week I was using, I couldn't find a vein for shit. I had blown and split and collapsed all my good ones, so I hadn't hit in a while. maybe once a fucking day I would hit, get really excited and blow the vein like an idiot anyway because of my excitement. but I took my last shot sunday (missed of course.. god damn it), but when I think about shooting up now. I think of the needle going through my tendons. the things I had to poke through, the pain of going wayyy too deep and missing anyway. and not being able to stretch my arms out cause I was going through tendons and ligaments and shit and it was all swollen. but yeah, the feeling of a needle going into my skin sounds like shit cause I was digging too deep. although of course, one more hit sounds so fucking amazing. 

although, I'm not going to do that last hit... (yet)...

I know I wont be clean forever, I usually don't last very long, but we'll see how long this lasts and when I relapse.. and what I relapse on. 

but for now, for those of you tryin' to kick. here's how I do it. every time. with a quick sub taper. I only used 1 this time. 

I took 4mg the first day, then 2mg, then 2mg, the next days. and that's it. gets you through the worst. no w/d from subs. no physical bullshit. gets you through the heavy cold sweats and all the heavy shit in the first few days and you can jump off the subs. I never let myself be on subs for more than 5 days. EVER.

so, to those of you tryin'a get clean. you can do it. shit, if I can? you can. I been sick it seems like for years though. just jumping from one drug to the other with dope in the middle always blah blah. but keep your heads up.. I been on the couch all week doing jack shit, and I know it feels like shit and you feel worthless (at least, I do.) but that's what you need to do. to get better. get through the worst. then figure shit out. 

I'm just trying hard right now to not use. and I mean, like, anything. sobriety is boring. it really is for me. I've been on a drug virtually every day since I was like 14 so sober days are really weird and boring. I like to just feel ANYTHING in my body. the come up. the peak. plateau. come down. whatever. just thinking about something in my body. not being sober. I'm sure I'm not the only one... 

anyway.. just wanted to share with your guys. I'm 99% sure I'll relapse eventually onto some opiate like I always do, but for now.. I am waking up feeling good for the first time in a LONG time... 

be smart brothers and sisters. stay safe. take care of yourselves and loved ones.

Then there's the time I was in this room at work that no one really has any reason to go into besides me, so I figured I was safe to prep a shot. Get it all ready, needle in my arm when the door opens. I push in and turn my back, pull it out and drop it in my pocket just in time for my boss to tell me it's lunch time. Looked at my arm right after he left and noticed the blood dripping down. Idk how he didn't notice that.

Then there's the time there was a bad snow storm and driving was banned, but I walked the mile or so in 2ft of snow over to my boy to grab a few bags. He wouldn't let me shoot in his car or house and no stores were open, so I found a set of stairs and shoot up on them. I stand up to walk back home and start puking as I'm going up the stairs, just as a family with small kids walks down. I smiled at them and kept puking.

Then at an old job I was sitting in my bosses office before anyone else had gotten there. I started at 6 and no one was supposed to be there til 7 so I figured I was safe. Do my shot, nod out only to get woken up by my friend/coworker asking me if I was hungover lol.

Then at that same job I was out at a job site with my boss and starting to get sick and I had no cash. I asked my boss to borrow $60 and he gave it to me! Yay! Hit up my boy and he said he'd be good in an hour or so, but I wouldn't be done working for another 4 hours. So when I got that I'm good text I told my boss that my girl locked herself out And I needed to go let her in and that id only be 20 minutes. Drive to my boy, pick up, get well. 40 minutes have passed and my boss is blowing up my phone. Sped back the whole way to a very angry boss who thought I had stolen the work truck.",1479571664.0

Last weekend I was at the end of my rope mentally, financially, the works. We've all been there. Then, out of the blue a redditor PMs me and offers to help me out. Completely caught me off guard. What an awesomely selfless act!
An answered prayer (or not?).

The next day, my boss tells me that I'm getting a raise. This is great news but doesn't help in the immediate sense as payday is another week away but still, a raise makes you feel good and gives you something to look forward to :)

My phone went for a swim a couple weeks ago and a buddy gave me his phone when he got a new one this week which was awesome. It's a Note 4 so not a crappy phone *at all*.

My power company was hitting me up for last month's bill and I had 3 days, at that point, to get it paid ...*or else*. I call in any and all favors, hit up everyone that owes me money and manage to just get the entirety of the bill together if I count the assistance from the aforementioned *awesome* redditor.

The count so far:

- Sunday: WD's, Desperation, panic.
- Monday: WD's, but got a raise. No Desperation ;)
- Tuesday: Awesome redditor offers to help, no WD's (managed to get well somewhat)
- Wednesday: WD's but hopeful.
- Thursday: Ohhh Thursday....


     - My car broke down but I managed to fix it myself via youtube and google
     - Lost a carton of cigarettes (which I happened to find today. yay!)
     - Dropped a refrigerator on my foot at work - no broken bones 
     - No WD's. A connect fronted out of the blue. Good day all things considered.


- Friday: Was supposed to hear from that redditor today but they were a no-call no-show. *Uh oh*. I feel uncomfortable reaching out to this person as they were doing me a kindness to begin with. I just borrow the power bill difference from a friend just to get it paid and over with. I ask the redditor if they are okay, if anything was wrong but never got a reply. This being an opiate related board, when people disappear all of a sudden, it might mean something really bad.
My youtube quick-fix for my car doesn't hold and breaks again. After a 5 block walk home and a googling,  I then fix it *again* using youtube and google as glue.

- Saturday: Computer wouldn't boot. ""Operating system not found"". Call my computer repair buddy. Hard drive is dead. Fortunately, I don't keep anything important on that drive and have learned to back up my shit as per my friend's admonishments throughout the years. Drive was supplied by my computer guy, as well, for free (awesome guy).
- Sunday: Uneventful which is good. Manage to stay well to a small degree without any drama.

Sorry for the newspaper-length post ;) I'm bored and thought this last week warranted a vent post. So much good and bad happened this week it was nuts. 

TL;DR: Got a raise, a redditor offered to help financially but bailed and ignored me, car broke down, computer broke, lost and found a carton of smokes, dropped refrigerator on my foot (no break), got a new(ish) phone, managed to pay a power bill and stay well much of the week in spite of it all.

And I look in mirror and my pupils are still a little big but they are constricting and dilating as they slowly get smaller, but literally as I look at myself they are going big to small to slightly bigger to slightly smaller.  I'm slowly feeling slightly better as heroin kicks in  but my stomach continues to gurgle and feel weird. 

My pupils are tripping me out, how they are bouncing around. I think I'm really sensitive to this first dose of ULDN and i am actually in slight WD and the heroin is trying to compete for the receptors. I haven't slept all night so that adds to my anxious discomfort.

I really don't think it's just placebo. This Naltrexone is powerful stuff. If I had taken more, like a couple milligrams, I'd surely be totally fucked right now.

 The heroin is kicking in a little more now and I'm starting to calm a little and feel it's slight effects. I want to snort a little more to feel better but I'm worried about even one dose of ULDN obliterating my tolerance back to naive levels and I don't want to OD.

Ok I'm feeling more normal now. I think the ULDN and heroin are balancing eachother out.

My goal with this is to taper off what little dope I have left (3-4 days worth using minimally) alongside the ULDN to come off the opiates and then slowly build up my naltrexone dose to LDN levels of 1-4.5mg to help rebuild neurotransmitters after opiate abuse and also for its purported positive health effects (anti cancer, fibromyalgia, pain conditions, PAWS, etc.). 

I can tell Naltrexone can be a harsh drug. I'm glad I only took my small dose and not like 10mcg+ like I was about to go for. I know someone will say I can't possibly feel even slight WD on mcg doses but I am very very sensitive to drug effects and WD in general and really attuned to what&how my body feels. Nobody can deny what my stomach has been doing for past hour. It's calmed down now. I'm getting horny. I haven't wanted sex in weeks. The guy who had the dilaudid blood in 2002 experimenting with ULDN said the same thing. I'm actually
getting pretty high RN. 

I read a lot of info before I did this but was still nervous going on. But the positive reports sound way too good to not try. Quitting opiates more easily with only minor withdrawal sounds amazing. Cause I'm sick of this shit tbh. Just wanna get clean but I don't want to go theoughbjperificnWDs (again).

Gonna try and get some sleep. I hope as the halflife of the ULDN wears off in my sleep that the little heroin i snorted doesn't get super strong and kill me in my sleep. All of this is somewhat uncharted territory. I just want to get off daily opiates and be able to enjoy them as a treat again and not be dependent on a stupid substance. ",1479673340.0

If you can find this exact model master lock key holder, or whatever it's called, you know the thing that a homeowner or a landlord will leave on the door with a copy of the key so the contractors and workers can get in? The thing in the fucking picture? Yeah grab one of those, set the code to something that a cop or a friend would never guess obviously nothing off your driver's license or birthday, and that's pretty much it keep your shit in there. It's extremely durable the inside Steel surrounded by thick rubber. If a cop wants to get into it he's going to need some type of power tools and as long as you're not doing anything else wrong they can't keep you long enough for them to get into it. Especially if your car is already a mess or you have a work truck or van, throw your dope in there toss it on the floor in the back seat and you are good to go. I've done it for years and been pulled over several times with that in my car, and they never even questioned ever asked what it is. And if they do ask what's in it or what's the combination say I'm not sure my mother left it in my car or at my house and asked me to bring it to her. So yeah, not saying it's foolproof but it's a lot better than riding around with a bag of dope in your sock or somewhere stupid like your steering wheel cover,  where the cops know to check.",1479797633.0

In 2014, in Maine alone, 208 people died from overdoses. That year, emergency responders saved 829 lives with naloxone. But that was just a fraction of those saved here, as most uses go unreported. In 83 percent of cases, according to a national survey last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, naloxone is given by other drug users, the people most likely to be on the scene, not by emergency responders. 
But in Maine this spring, Gov. Paul LePage, a Republican, questioned the effectiveness of naloxone and vetoed legislation that would have increased access to it.

“Naloxone does not truly save lives; it merely extends them until the next overdose,” Mr. LePage wrote in his veto message in April. “Creating a situation where an addict has a heroin needle in one hand and a shot of naloxone in the other produces a sense of normalcy and security around heroin use that serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction.”

Well I just wanted to tell my part in how I got through the hell of detox(sort of because of my suboxone taper plan).

I did my last shot(about half a bag of fire dope) Saturday morning around 6am so I could get through my shift at work. 

The night before I copped 25 10mg valiums for the price of  $20. 

I got home around 2pmish in in the afternoon and popped 3 vs and basically blacked myself out and slept until 4pm-9pm on my couch until I woke up took 2 valiums more and slept until I woke up at 6 am Sunday(24 hours since last dose) morning and took half an 8mg sub.

I fell back asleep for about 4 more hours then woke up and and took 3 more 10mg valiums along with the other 4mg sub. 

Knocked out for another 4- 6 hours woke up     feeling restless legs and all that so I took 2 more valiums and another half a sub. 

This repeated and in another 5 or 6 hours I woke up, popped 2 more v's and another half of a sub(2 subs total). Would wake up kind of uncomfortable, but took 2 more valiums and by the time I woke up I felt pretty lethargic and it was Monday so I had to go to work. I took another 4mg of sub while on my 30 min drive in and by the time I got in still felt shitty, but once I started getting going I guess the suboxone worked it's magic and I got through work feeling fairly normal. After work I came home around 4 and took the other half around 6pm (3 subs total). I've taken 1 valium since I got home to relax. And I must say I feel as OK as if I did a shot of dope. 

I had some pretty bad cravings for a few hours. Looking for any left over bags,  cottons, all that shit. But I got through it, my girl came over and it really helped me take my mind off the dope. All I have to say is ""disraction"" is key. 

My description here doesn't add up because I had 25 valiums and one 1mg Xanax stash and I have 2 valiums left so I def took more than I thought.

I'm not advocating extensive benzo use to get through withdrawals, but I can say for a fact that blacking myself out for a weekend and taking subs in between wake up definitely got me through the real shit.

That being said, I had my girl and parents checking on me the whole time while I had no idea blacked out. So that was definitely a huge safety factor. 

But this Monday morning I took half a sub on my way to work and got through this day feeling absolutely fine. 

I'm going to taper my sub use, taking only a quarter tomorrow morning with reinforcements on deck.

But I will say that this is the easiest time I've had getting through the worst of it. 

This is just me though, everybody is different. I probably took 20 or more 10mg valiums in about 36 hours. I really can't remember.

I please and almost beg your guys opinions so that people stay safe. 

I'm just letting you know how I got through it and maybe, for you who are trying to quit, can safely figure out your own way to get through this hell that we all know too well. 

I really don't see this lasting. But for now, it is pure bliss not being a slave to dope.

This is before I ever started doing dope which was about 6 years ago and my graduation date is February 2016 when my first blood was drawn. A

Anyway before dope I used to enjoy the hell out of buprenorphine. Half a strip would have me extremely loaded for at least 6 hours after the fact. This is the most fucked up from an opiate I got to this day. So when I was lucky enough to get a Subutex which was very rare, I started to experiment with the tablets and since I was smoking and snorting dope at the time, no iv yet, I wanted the most from my drug. So I popped a corner off the tablet, threw it on the dull side of some foil and proceeded to chase it just like you would some good tar or any other pull that you would smoke. It left a nice trail, smoke was not that harsh at all and tasted like roasted marshmallow, and effects were instant and after about a little less than a quarter pill, were extremely strong. I would duck out for hours and then could even go back and smoke the trail the pill left on it and get high from that. 

So what made me think of this is that I just received a couple Subutex from this outpatient detox they have in my area and for 10 dollars a visit it is the cheapest route to Suboxone. But I was reminiscing on the golden days and might pick me up some foil and re live it just for nostalgia purposes.",1479783382.0

High,

I recently got my hands on a few hydromorphones 2MG. They look exactly like the ones in the picture I uploaded. I think they're the Canadian brand Dilaudid, anyone know if there's fillers in these?

Also.. whats the best ROA? I'm looking for some tips on the best way to take thse, OTHER than IV.. I have no idea where to even start for IV'ing.. Anyone got some advice?

Also, I read somewhere about eating greasy food or some shit potentiates the effects? Any news on this?

I warned him to not let it run him again, I've been doing okay not letting opiates run my money and life but I always fuck around time to time abd maintain myself on methadone from a dude I knows take homes from a clinic.

So I posted an ad on Friday and was looking for someone ASAP. I was about to go into WD in a few hours and wouldn't even be able to give a ""massage"" even if I did get a hit. I got a few hits but nothing that was for Friday. We emailed back and forth over the weekend then eventually moved to texting. We agree on time, day, length of time, location, and amount. I get there on time and everything is going fine. I'll call my ""friend"" Joe for anonymity. This was the first time we ever met. I get to Joe's place. It was a condo six stories up on the lake. Fucking gorgeous. Marble everywhere. Security guard etc. I haven't done this in a long time because of just the length of time it takes to get someone to agree on what both of our needs are, the legality of it even though I did nothing wrong but give a massage ;), and I am in a relationship as well and a whole bunch of other reasons. My SO knows what I do and is OK with it. I just don't like leaving her side. She was at work when this went on so it was OK to go through with. I get into the condo and not having done something like this in a while I wasn't ""on point"". My brain was all over the place and I was starting to sweat,mild WD. There where candles lit and paper towels on the coffee table for whatever they needed to be for (he put them there) as well as a tissue box. I started the massage. The music is enchanting and relaxing both of our minds. (I used coconut oil as lubricant). Everything is fine right. I run out of coconut oil after a while from rubbing on my hands and have to get more every so often meaning I reach to the coffee table and get some. Thank God he had the paper towels there because I did start to sweat like I said, and I used a few to wipe it off. So I get my hands all lubed up again and then about three min later I start to hear something. Like a crackling that shouldn't be heard indoors. Then I smell a smell I shouldn't be smelling indoors!!!! I look over and fuuuuuuuuuuuuck me the fucking tissue box in in fucking full flames. Shit. Fuck. Balls. Ass naked I grab the fucking Kleenex box on what little ass corner I could, black soot and tissue flying all over the fucking place through the air. Running to the bathroom, like a chicken with my head cut off, and throw the box in the toilet, because anything on fire indoors that can be, should be, thrown in the toilet. Right? Got dayum I wasn't thinking at all. The condo didn't smoke up too bad but bad enough and thank God no fucking fire alarms went off.Looking like an idiot I proceeded to apologize profusely and to just clean the shit (Kleenex in the toilet) up and get this shit over with. He helped me and assured me that everything was fine/ok. We opened up the balcony sliding doors and was able to let all the smoke out. I was able to get back to finishing this fucking ""massage"" and got my fucking roses and got the fuck out of there. Don't be an idiot like me and catch tissues on fire if your going to do a G4P.

Don't you just hate when you run out of good veins to hit? Or maybe ur one of the lucky ones that don't ever run into this problem. Last night I was in the bathroom for over an hour trying to hit myself. Freaking out, blood all over myself and the floor, rig filled with blood, more than frustrated (you'd think I had just been stabbed or was filming a scene in a horror movie) I finally found a shit spot in my hand. Didn't even feel a vein there but I seen one, or maybe it was just a figment of my imagination. Who knows. But I hit it. Barely felt it. Was sooo pissed. Just spent over an hour poking at myself like a human voodoo doll and barely felt my shot. 

It's such an awesome feeling when you randomly find that one spot, that vein that never fails you, your honey hole that's always there... and then it just disappears. Gone. Vanished. See ya later! (hopefully) Haven't poked it in about a week and every time I prep my candy, I hope it's there and won't have to struggle. It's as if I can taste the sugar in my mouth already but can't get the wrapper open

This morning I hit my hand again but in a different spot. I didn't miss (or atleast Im pretty sure I didn't) because blood kept rushing back and it didn't burn. So why did I barely feel it? Don't get me wrong, I got high, but not as much as I normally would hitting someplace else. Is it because I'm hitting my hand? I'd like to think it gets lost in my bloodstream somewhere along the way from my hand to my head, where as if I hit my forearm it's closer to my head. But that can't be a rational explanation. 

I know this is a total /junkiepost but I know everyone must have that one favorite spot, or if you're unlucky like me, have a decent amount of struggle ahead of you almost every time.

**But what about the nurture?**

 I had some bad times growing up. You know, the usual: mother was a functioning alcoholic whom was Hyde in the day and Jekyll at night after drinking. Parents divorced upon my agreement, saw some dramatical things happen to parents, had some nasty things said to me. Some light physical and mental abuse, father terminally ill now.

But, I lived a normal suburban life all-in-all. Did well in school, parents provided me with all resources needed (clothes, books, shoes, computers, ipods, etc), had birthdays, parents bought my first car, college paid for-- but still there was always a darkness over me. And from an early age, getting high was the best moments, and the most exciting. 

I know people have gone through much more serious trauma than I; rape, deaths, abuse, broken families, neglect... My life wasn't that bad. My life was fairly normal and tolerable. 

**But I have to think: would I be an addict if my environment was different?**

Just different within reason: no alcoholism for my mom, no illness that's killing my dad or the abuse he sustained as a child which was transferred to me. What if my parents were religious? What if I had a bigger family? What if I was forced to be in sports? What if my parents didn't treat me like an adult from such a young age?
What if we had more money and I didn't need to worry?

I never thought my upbringing was bad enough to have contributed. But since seeing a therapist, she feels very different. And the whole topic has me wondering.

1.  Were my genes coupled to my environment the recipe for inevitable addiction?

This has nothing to do with opiates but I figured I'd post here because you're my people.

My family don't know I'm a pillhead.  I'm functioning so have a job, appartment, yada yada.  Just a bit of background. 

I just found out that nobody is inviting me for Christmas, for the first year ever in my life.  I always spent it with my parents, and grandparents when they were alive.  But this year, my parents are going out for Christmas dinner, and my brother and his wife are having friends over for a christmas dinner party.  That leaves.....me.

I'm just really dreading it.  And really hurt that none of them want me there.  I don't know what I'm going to do with myself all day.  Cook dinner, take drugs, watch TV I guess.

I was puking and shitting fire every 15 minutes on the dot for 3-4 days straight.  I could not crawl to the bathroom after a while and ended up just puking on my comforter for a day or so.  The insomnia and RLS was so frustrating, but I would wager the most frustrating symptom was puking every time I tried to hydrate.  I lost 15 lbs. over 5 days and ended up hospitalized for dehydration.  I know opiate WD is not lethal but I honestly believe that the dehydration might have ended up really killing me.

Ahh what a day- bare with me as I'm gonna tell the whole thing start to finish from the beginning of the day as I think itll put the end into context better.

So I'm on week 2 of a new job- been grinding a minimum of 10 hours every single day and I was honestly a little worried about my learning curve. Well today it all started to come around and I really grinded the phones and emails setting up some good business and actually made a pretty good sale- the quickest anyone at the company has sold anything let alone a deal of this size since getting their certification (got mine last Friday at the end of my first week- also very quick compared to normal). Also had some really good calls and demonstrations which should set some business up for tomorrow and early next week. I did all this being moderately dope sick and regular sick as well. So I'm texting my old head guy who is consistent as fuck and treats me well thruout the day. He tells me he's gonna be ready for me when I leave work so I grind even harder to earn my shot. I end up leaving work around 5:45 after much congrats from my manager and a couple of beers drank in the office (they were carting them around cuz most people aren't gonna be in the office tomorrow- a sort of holiday celebration). 

As I leave the office I call my old head dude and ask about the quality and he says ""you know me fam- this new shit but it's always torch."" I take the train over to him and it takes fucking forever. We are stopping for a full 5 minutes between every stop until eventually they stopped for 20 minutes and removed a cart. Idk where the fuck they removed it to but who am I to give a fuck. I get to where he's at and there's police everywhere outside so he comes into the train station and hooks me up with a gram for 80 in two little half bags. 

The train ride home is super long again but I'm vibing to some music and looking forward to my end of the day wind down shot so I endure it and soon enough I'm at home- basketball on the TV, lil Durk on my speakers and a spoon on my table. I smell the dope and it doesn't really have any smell. I'm already a little sketched out cuz the good shit he's had lately has smelled SUPER vinegary. When I put the water in the spoon it makes a gross thick milky white solution. I know right away it's not dope but I'm so pissed off that I shoot it anyway. I register with one of my two shitty dull, used a million time needles (I have a box of fresh ones on the way from da internet but low and behold they are not here yet) and plunge the gross cum-like solution into my veins and feel nothing. I let homeboy know whatsup and he's dissapointed that he got ripped off and tells me he'll call me back. He calls his guy and his guy confirms that other people said its garbage and is gonna make it right for him- so he tells me he'll make it right BUT not tonight as he is attending his sons football game. 

DAMN I'm blown- but I guess tomorrow should be decent when I get off work. The feeling of being burned (albeit unintentionally) is settling in uncomfortably on me but I can't imagine taking the hour train (each way) to cop from one of my other connects. I start to fold some clothes when BAM a spare key to one of my relatives car which is never used and parked at the apartment im living in by myself falls onto the bed. Thinking it's meant to be I call my Call of Duty dopeboy (referring to a recent post I made- this is my childhood friend) and he tells me a long story about how he tried to make a move in NY today and got burned. I ask him what he's working with n he says he has something. I ask how it is and he says ""I mean the shit straight."" I'm used to dope boys always telling me they got bomb shit so I'm a little skeptical but I say fuck it and make the 35 minute drive to him. I give him the bread for a half and he puts the shit directly in my jacket pocket. I have want to check it out right then n there after getting burned but I said fuck it and hopped in the car and drove home. On the car ride home there are cops everywhere and the traffic is nightmarish- it takes me almost an hour to get back. 

I run upstairs and throw the spoon on the table, turn the speakers on and put the basketball game on again- I'm thinking how this is what it was SUPPOSED to be like right when I got home earlier. I whip the dope bag out and pour it in the spoon and it has a strong vinegary smell. It draws up dark brown, I register after poking myself with a dull needle and digging around for like 20 minutes anddddd somehow miss 90% of the shot. Fucking of course.

I for some reason reached in my pocket only to realize there was another bag in there. What in the fuck is going on? I text him to let him know cuz he's my guy and I'd pay him for it if he wanted when I get my check- he tells me he did it on purpose. I draw this bag up and use dull needle #2, somehow register in a relatively unused vein immediatly and slam that bitch. TORCH HOE. 

Sometimes all the bullshit u gotta deal with makes the end result that much better.

5ef7nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ef7nv/any_ideas/,9,https://redd.it/5ef7nv,Sneakers707,Any ideas?,"First time post. Really long time lurker. Please be gentle.

 Basically I have a bad pain condition and really need pain meds. Had the same script for almost six years. 180 10mg percs a month. Also took over the counter Motrin, Ibuprofen, Advil, any vitamin or legal thing I could do to get and help daily just to try and cope. Saw a doctor at the pain clinic not a PA for the first time in years who said I needed a drug holiday. He couldn't believe the PA's had kept me on the exact same dose for this long. He switched me to extended release morphine 30 mg 2x day. He did that as a trial for one week. After a week I was losing my mind, could barely walk in so much pain. He added another 15 mg per day after a week. Dr said give it a month or two then we'll put you on extended release oxycontin after have given your body a break from the oxycodone. 

I go for my monthly visit this Monday. Here's the problem. After I kept reading about the DEA and this opiate epidemic BS I started feeling progressively more nervous and scared like any month they will stop prescribing me and I don't know how I will function. Literally every month before my appt I pray they will please keep me on my medicine so I can walk, sleep, think. I started taking a little less each day to save up so in case they could no longer prescribe I could still function until I found a solution. I have intentionally put myself in more pain by slightly delaying my dose for months just in case. Embarrassed to admit how scared I am of being out of pain meds. So this past month I have been taking the morphine as prescribed but with percs every day as well. Between both it's been okay. I don't think the morphine is very helpful on its own. I randomly get drug tested so I searched here and thought if I take my last Percocet tonight then I should only test positive for the morphine and not the percs on Monday if I happen to get drug tested. I have the single last Percocet laid out on my nightstand and I know tomorrow and the rest of the week is going to be miserable without the Percocet. I did try three days of the morphine only when he first prescribed it and the pain was so bad I couldn't sleep much and had to use my crutches all the time instead of rarely. 

I would like to keep taking the Percocets until Monday so I can be okay but can't think of how to explain why they would be in my system since I can't tell the truth to the Dr. I know I have to stop but am trying to think of anything I can do to help with the pain enough to just get by or any plausible explanation as to why I still would have Percs and was taking them. I plan on saying the morphine really didn't work, which it doesn't, can we do the er oxycontin that was discussed. I might not have a drug test but I have to plan that I will just in case. 

Any ideas would be really welcome. Sorry for the long post. ",1479872578.0

Secondly, I like to put the tooter far up my nose so the powder doesn't contact the first inch or so of the nostril.

UPDATE,"So she says the DEA is pushing them to lower the doses of non terminal patients to approx 90mg morphine equivalent. So she did not drop me like the letter suggested shebjust stated she could no longer keep me at those doses if i wanted to stay her patient, otherwise id havento go elsewhwre. So she is tappering me off the fent to 25mcg but im just gunna get off it completely, but she is keeling my scripts for 180 4mg dilaudid a month. 



Like i thought no one had turned me in for anything or she had not seen any of the posts that had her named blackened out in them. 


So just an update i wont have to go through hell in withdraws at all. Ill get rid of the shitty fent that doesnt do anything for me, lower my tolerence a fuck ton, cause i was on 100mcg fent patch every 3 day. So ill just have the 180 dillys a month and will have no problem running out short by any means.


Sorry for rant just this day went so much better than i thought it was going to go. Hope everyone is safe n happy nods to yall.

The general idea:

A Bluetooth heart rate monitor (some as cheap as 20 to 25 dollars) on Amazon, would be worn by the user while they were using and had their phone nearby. If their heart rate dropped to a certain level (or stopped), the app would play an alarm that the user, if coherent, could put in a code to stop. If the code was not entered in a certain time period, the app would contact an emergency response operator and provide gps location of the user and the operator could contact local emergency services. Or the app could contact local emergency services directly, I don’t know how that works. 


I know the idea is similar to the Reddit inspired Remote Egg Timer App however I think this idea is different because it is a passive system, other than wearing the monitor, the user does not have to do anything and the app can be monitoring and running in the background. The user does not have to actively set alarms for each dose that is taken. 


I am not in a position to develop or fund such an app but thought the idea has merit and maybe others could build on it or make it a reality. 


Thoughts?

3. EDIT: 7 sprays now I feel slight euphoria, motor skills still top notch, but how do I know when to stop or when I'm too close to OD? 

I'm opiate naive.

Some details if you feel like warning me about stupidity:
      I had a zip bag with 25mg, I scooped out less than 5% of its contents. We have max 1.25mg divided by 60 (number of sprays my nasal holds). That makes 0.02mg per spray. Let's say I fucked up big time somewhere in this math and tenfolded the dose which still brings me to 0.2mg per spray. The LD-50 for my weight is 2.1mg if I was a rat.

What sort of dosage should I start with this? I'm going to snort it. Matchead size bump and just every 10 minutes or so build up till I'm 'there'?

I was unable to open my scrunched up finger from its grip, my mind was unable to tell my finger to outstretch successfully and when I tried doing it manually it really fucking hurt. I loosened the string and it still stayed stuck for another maybe ten seconds, when I regained movement again. 

Anyone have any idea what caused this? Could I have triggered a nerve or something when tying off? I think I did pull the string a bit tighter than I should have out of frustration of not being able to hit - I use pretty pure #4 (I'm in Australia) but I have a hard time finding a usable vein, and have fucked my arms pretty well over the years, and have hit nerves/arteries a few times resulting in massive swelling, and I've had surgery a couple of years ago on both forearms to remove blood and water oedemas that formed (I'm guessing from shooting large amounts of water and biodone in the veins there using 20ml barrels + butterflys, or too many misses, not sure). So I definitely haven't treated my arms with the respect they deserve, but I've never experienced anything quite like this, it felt like I was pulling a puppet string - a painful one.

The only thing close to this feeling I have experienced is when I've neared the end of some of the sets I've played with various bands over the years, usually with guitar, occasionally with bass, my strumming hand had frozen up completely and my fingers have done a similar clenching action that I'm unable to stop. When it has happened I've dropped the pick/plectrum and am unable to muster the motor control to pick it back up and hold it, leaving me to try and finish the song strumming with the back of my hand, since it hurts to touch my fingers.

Any ideas what is actually happening in my body when something like this happens?",1479986648.0

Had a guy in **. Always had Roxys, for two years. I would get 4 or 5 at a time- never got THAT into them.

My roommate asked me if I knew anyone who could get his friends Vicodin. I said I knew a Oxy guy. He puts me in touch with his friend. His friend wants 80 roxy 30s- I agree. I tell him how much it is and this guy gives me MUCH more than the actual cost. I didn't plan on making it a regular thing, but the cash was SO good.

We do several deals with this guy who I'd been using all along. He and I did well. After a few months, a couple weeks ago, of course it finally happened.

My friend's friend gives me a ton of $$, I get a ton of 30s for him. 3 hours later, I get the call ""these things aren't working"". I assume my guy will take care of it. Nope. He strings me along all day, and my roommate's friend, starts going into withdrawal (10 a day habit)  and he has guns. He tells me this will be a ""dark day"" for me. I've been telling my guy for HORUS that I'm about to be killed. Finally my guy tells me he's 15 minutes out. He never fucking shows.

I called another connect and emptied out my bank account to give him a few (not nearly worth as much as he lost). And I run around trying to score as much as he needs again with his money fearful that we'll get fakes again.

Lesson learned. I haven't done any since when this happened a couple weeks ago. I'm still a little worried about retribution, but so far nothing. I wasn't raised like this. I was raised upper-middle class and am a college grad. This would be a hell of a way to go, wouldn't it? Like those poor assholes in Pulp Fiction.",1479967609.0

Great heroin, smelled like a bag of salt and vinegar chips, long lasting, uncut, literally a quarter point snorted is enough to get me feeling good for 8 hours. Great painkilling effect and a general sense of long lasting well
Being that is really addictive to me. While using this stuff reasonably I feel very functional.

Ran out and copped some local stuff. It's not heroin. Pure white, gets me mostly unsick but not totally, lacks the full warmth full body effect of heroin--- just something missing. And the worst part, only keeps me well for like 3-4 hours. I can feel myself withdrawing off heroin in the background while this stuff covers me, if that makes sense. I'm hoping I can stop using it in the next day or so and by then be past the peak of the H withdrawal. 

What the hell is it? Fent? U-4? W-18? I don't plan on getting anymore and will be taking a break and getting on naltrexone to stay clean until at least the new year, maybe longer.

At the same time we also realize that with opiates damage is inevitable. Even following a full scale legalization and making access for treatment far more available addiction is still going to be a problem for many people. 

At the same time the drug gangs and the associated violence/incarceration (one of the main reasons for legalization) will only go away if another supplier comes in. Here we get to speculative fiction because, unless I am wrong, no one has really attempted this. What do you think would be the best model? Obviously it would have to sufficiently fill the demand in the market enough to undercut the cartels profits. If people were just provided X amount of government allowed opiates per day and it's a limit that is way under what many opiate users are taking they will just go to their dboy instead. No matter what approach addicts are gonna addict but if no approach is taken to give a legal, regulated supply of opiates the gangs will remain in power and the jails will stay full. 

I admit I don't really have many good ideas on this. What approach do you think would minimize the inevitable damage of addiction as much as possible while simultaneously filling the gap enough to put a dent in the black market and its associated problems? Pharmacies with a file on everyone who purchases? A model similar to weed dispensaries that is more liberal but still heavily regulated? A strict methadone clinic type approach where all use is supervised? Really curious what other people think.

Ive been doing a couple things on the side that have been fairly lucrative and thought id share. 

Walmart. Everyone knows the 'find receipt, return stolen items' thing. Well all the walmarts around me will only give you cash for a debit or cash receipt. Credit receipt or no receipt? Getting a gift card at best. Been getting a lot of gift cards lately. Some dboys will take them but a lot wont. The ones that will usually expect at least half price. Fuck that noise. If I wanted to do that id sell it to a pawn shop. A couple ways ive been turning them into cash (really just two variations on the same thing):
1) walk around the check out lines and look for someone out of earshot of an employee and also with enough stuff in their cart to be at least the amount thats on the card. Im normally straight up with them and just say ""hey Im sorry to bother you. I was going to see if youd do me a small favor...I have this card (displaying card) with x $ on it...could you just let me swipe this for your groceries and then you could just give me (x minus 10$ or so) for it? That way you save some money too"". Usually works.
2) if that doesnt work and I have to start walking around the store I usually switch to a ""hi. I have this card for x amount. I was wondering if youd be interested in just giving me (x minus 20~$. I hate doing it because you have to start taking a bigger loss) for it and that way you save 20$ on your shopping today"". I usually try to have the slip of paper with the amount on it too. Uf they dont immediately say no I tell them id be happy to go through the line with them so they know its legit. Tjis works less often than asking at check out but still i dont think ive ever been disappointed. 

The second thing ive been doing is going to gas stations with an empty walmart card. Some times my kids with me some times not. I have a two year old that lots of times I have no one to watch him. Anyways ive been telling people that I have 1.50$ or something on it and thst me and my son are trying to make it home. Would they be willing to trade the 1.50$ in cash for the card? 10/10 they dont take the card.  7/10 they give me at least 5$. Lots of people will give me 10+ though.

I know its nothing special but hopefully this stuff can help some people. Good luck!

Edit: since everyone seems to be latching on to the smallest part of this post. My kid has been with me two times. Neither time was that the point of him being there. I am by no means advocating the use of your child to get dope money. Jesus christ.",1479946748.0

I was up £8k then I lost it all....not only did I lose it all but I left a few hundred in my bank..so..I decided I could not afford to use that (needed it to make ends meet) and so I used my credit card on online casinos. I lost £5000 which is my limit. At this point I was screwed... I saved money and against the odds turned £70 into £5400 over hours of straight slot playing with a bit of roulette. At this point I could pay the £5000 credit card debt and in reality be a few hundred up...... obviously the fact I was at one stage £8k up was playing on my mind. I stupidly played after a few drinks and surprise surprise I was £5000 in debt again on my credit card. Again I saved and convinced myself I could pay off the debt. Changed my casino passwords to things I would never remember....
After a few weeks I put a small amount in and again believe it or not somehow was £2000 up.
I stopped for a while but work was slow and I had that nagging feeling again.
I turned the £2k into £6k. stopped again for a bit..
Then I played a full day on slots and roulette. I hit a few bonuses and a few numbers, I got up to £15k.
Stopped again for a few days... then one night when working late I deposited £2000 out of the £15k with the aim of reaching £20k up in total (another £3k)
I got to £2700 within 10 mins. Now the sensible part of me said right that was lucky, call it a day, but I played on...
I got to £8k down (out of the £15k so still 7 up) and so went to the roulette. I kept loading on 3 single numbers, one more heavily than the others and it came up.
It made me now a total of £19300 up.
I stopped for a few days.
Tonight I just went on and deposited £1300, this time just chasing a £700 profit just to make me £20k up in total...
No reason why, I do not have an amount I need but I just did it....
I lost the deposit in minutes, deposited again and again until I was £9000 down (out of my £19k plus winnings). I deposited again and lost that too. I then tried to deposit again but it was declined. The bank obviously thought it was suspicious activity and blocked my card. I rang them and resolved it. At this point most of my winnings were gone but I was still up and not broke.
I was down to £2000 that I had in my casino account from my last deposit. That was my limit I told myself. But I knew I would not walk even if I lost it. I hit 0 on roulette, heavily loaded but ironically only about half what I had on earlier in the night.
It made me less down.
I considered withdrawing that and taking it as a lesson.... but I played on...
up and down on roulette I left... hit the slots.
£32 a spin, hit a feature which retriggered twice, lots of free spins. I won £6400. I was close to my starting profit at this stage.
I withdrew £4000 and needed to turn the £2400 into £5000 to be back where my profit started.
I went right down to £70 before again hitting a free spin feature. I got up to £4200.
Withdrew £3500 meaning I was now £1500 off my initial profit and had £700 to play with.
I again went down to double figures but hit a feature on what would have been my last few spins.
I got up to £1100, £400 off my target (to break even on profit!)
I then lost it all after a rollercoaster.
So I am still approx £18k up but the fact I chase losses and can't stop thinking about that money is not reassuring.
I have lost big before for the sake of chasing a few hundred pounds.
Gambling is a mugs game no matter what anyone says. I have pulled it back from some dire situations but this story could have been so different.
After losing £9000 and potentially being £11k down from my winnings, I knew I would chase it no matter what. If I did not hit a big win who knows what would have happened?
Writing this has helped put it into perspective and is helping me fight any urges to chase my loss of profit.
The problem is you carry on and win money and think see! good job I did not stop on tuesday, then lose then win some back and think See! good job I did not settle for getting 70% back!
I think this time. I will stop for Good.
Use the money to make legit money.
Anyway. Thanks if you read this far. I hope it shows you the potential to fuck up even though this story does not have a bad ending (so far)

The comments I contributed led to a few PM's and I was also happy to reply to them. One of them basically asked for some basic advice, and while I cannot (and more importantly DO NOT) give advice, I can give people a brief understanding of their rights, and they can apply it to their own situation. Please further note that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, state to state and so on, and so your laws may be different. The only legal advice in this post is to hire your own attorney, and ask them your questions.  Still, I've spoken with the mods about verifying me as an attorney, but in the meantime, if you doubt my credentials you could voir dire me (ask me questions to see if I know what a lawyer should know, but please just PM me those). 

**With that out of the way, I'm going to paste in pretty much the entirety of my response to the PM which basically serves as a primer on police/citizen encounters and your rights under the 4th Amendment:**

Well, a lot will depend on who you are/what you look like. Age, sex, race all play a part in it.  

The best things to remember are that during a consensual encounter, you are free to leave. You shouldn't say much because anything that starts getting suspicious will help generate probable cause (or inspire the officer to make it up). If you're free to leave, do so. No explanations, just justification, just ""Can I go?"" and go. 

If the officer is doing a detention (not an arrest, but you're not free to leave) then you're subject to a pat-down, but still aren't required to answer any questions. If anything on your person is immediately apparent as either a weapon or contraband when the officer does the pat-down, they're allowed to fish it out. That basically means if you've got something, it should be in a container that doesn't give the officer that cause (shouldn't resemble a weapon or other contraband... cigarette packs are also a bad idea just because cops look there first). 

If you're placed under arrest, the officer may search you incident to arrest. They don't generally do a cavity search, but will make a thorough inventory search of you and your belongings, including opening all closed containers. 

The officer may detain you for officer safety, or because they have probable cause to believe you either just committed a crime, are committing a crime, or are about to commit a crime. The test for whether that cause is valid is ""the totality of the circumstances"" which means that any and details are important. Do not appear as a threat, do not appear out of place, do not be high or dopesick (if you can help it), etc. etc. including don't appear nervous  I know it sounds crazy, but if you're regularly engaged in criminal activity do some role playing so the situation doesn't catch you off-guard. Have a friend play the role of officer and you assert you rights, both in a traffic stop and on foot. Again, I know that sounds ridiculous, but it could very well make the difference. 

If you're in a vehicle, the rules are a little different, mostly since you've probably been stopped for breaking the law already and justifying the detention. In a vehicle, don't try to get out of the ticket, just politely ask the officer to get you cited and let you get back to your business (try not to give anything specific or detailed, because if they smell deception, they'll push and proved harder). If you're arrested while driving (like a suspended license charge or a preexisting warrant) then 1.) you've already for my first rule: don't break more than one law at a time and 2.) you have the right to have your car towed or driven away by a licensed driver, but only within a reasonable time. The officer doesn't have to wait an hour for someone to come get your car, but they should let you have the car towed at your expense somewhere. This should prevent an ""inventory"" search of the vehicle where you may have additional drugs. (**PLEASE NOTE, OF ALL THE THINGS IN THIS MESSAGE, THIS IS THE ONE I'M LEAST SURE OF APPLYING TO NON-GEORGIA STATES**; the rest is mostly based on constitutional law and principles from the U.S. Supreme Court and should apply everywhere, but some may not, your mileage may vary). 

This is a pretty basic overview of search and seizure principles. You're going to find yourself in a position where you feel like you have to gamble by either A.) try to talk your way out of a problem, which may or may not work, and will ultimately make convicting you later a lot easier or B.) Keeping quiet, risking an arrest/ticket but having an easier time fighting the search, which may or may not work. I generally advise people to keep quiet, but they generally don't listen. It's tough because if you could talk yourself out, you'd be golden (plus they'd never find what you were trying to hide) but talking is almost always going to incriminate you further, even when you think it won't. 

I hope this helps. I'll probably go ahead and post this to the sub as a primer on 4th Amendment and police/citizen encounters. ",1479927291.0

Anyway things are going pretty well. Its a new program the state is trying and using us as guinea pigs. I'm literally the 2nd person to enter it. Its a 90 day rehab called the MAT program and uses suboxone. The first week I got 12 mgs. The next week 8mgs. The next 4 weeks 6 mgs. And tom. I drop down to 4mg. I'll be on sub's for 70 of the 90 days I'm here. Its setup for people without insurance.

Also we live in a house that sleeps 10 guys in 5 rooms and 4 bathrooms and they provide a food drop off every week. As well as I signed up for food stamps. The first 30 days we have groups M-F until about 4 with an hour lunch between. And Fridays we have a big book meetings together. Besides that we have AA and NA meetings within walking distance of our house we can go to at nights. 

The second set of 30 days we only have to go MWF til lunch and can get a job. I worked a week at a factory job but the pay didnt match the slave driven work and I was being offered drugs every night and had to wind up walking out before I relapsed. 

The last 90 days we just have to go to grouos once a week and will come off the suboxone completely. I will admit that I'm worried we will not have enough time off the suboxone before we are discharged and am looking into getting into a halfway house once I leave and its looking promising. 

I truely owe my life to this opportunity its been perfect for my situation. This is the most clean time I've had in over 10 years even though suboxone isn't technically clean I still count it.

First 3 or 4  years just blowing that awesome white in those nice little bundles (his stamp was ""biggie"" and features a picture of B.I.G ) IVed a hand full of times and managed to not make it his choice of administration. At 15 copin was hard enough never mind finding gear. Then ended up out west and pretty much only found tar, and chased primarily, with only a few times slammin, then ended up in the middle of the woods 200 miles from a exchange so stayed away from IVin for quite some time. Things have been getting shitty and hes gottta kick ( wont be the last time, some of us are lifers ) Hes got about a week working, and preparing to kick. ( kicking off grid in the woods when everyday is pretty much work just to survive ) but can only afford a tiny bit. If he smoked it he might have 3 days max, but when your burning around a half gram and up everytime you have smoke which is about every 2 to 4 hours including waking up at night just to stay well, shit goes quick and his money is tight. Hes got a suture kit with some rigs and thinks that might stretch out what he has left so he can prepare for a date with satan herself.

Personally I'm a huge space buff and am really into space exploration, astronomy, astrophysics, etc and this show is all about what it realistically will be like on the first human trip to Mars, from challenges as simple as making it there in deep space, to landing on target, to weakened gravity at 30% Earth's AND having to suddenly work hard after being in zero g for 7 months, etc etc the list goes on. It's a really good show and realistic with highlights of today's technology getting us closer to being ready to go to Mars being showcased with little mini documentary style snips throughout the main, fictional series.

Anyway, moving on to the point. The commander was injured after being thrown about during landing and needed surgery once they finally made it to their pre-assembled base camp. The mission physician, while still taking her EVA suit off and starting to cut the commander's open, was shouting for supplies from the other crew members. When she realized what the issue was and knew she'd be cutting in deep to drain the lung of blood, she yelled out for fentanyl:

""Get him 100 mikes [mcg] of fentanyl; he's going to feel this!""

I must say it triggered me to do a shot before watching the rest of the show. I also find it peculiar how I for some reason find it interesting when opiates are mentioned in movies/TV in a medical setting, I guess because I know what they're talking about when maybe some don't? I don't know, it's weird how it interests me like this.

5etly6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5etly6/the_case_for_carfentanil/,55,https://redd.it/5etly6,rerint,The case for Carfentanil,"For the last three weeks I have been using carfentanil exclusively to maintain my opioid dependence. I think there is a case to be made for most addicts to at least try substituting their current habit for this substance. 
The biggest plus point I see for using carfentanil over other opioid drugs is the price. I have spent the equivalent of about 45 $ in total (50 mg) which was sufficient for the last 21 days of being maintained. Carfentanil is also much less habit forming than other fentanyl derivatives since its half life is about 7 hours afaik. I need two sprays in the morning and one before bed. If the solution is sufficiently diluted and one is able to practice a certain degree of self control I don't think overdose is likely as long as the preparation is prepared to be dose correct.
A nasal spray solution does not require injection, plugging, snorting of caustic chemicals and is easy and discrete to administer. 
From my experience this is definitely the most euphoric of all the fentanyl derivatives I've tried, it also seems to suppress breathing to a much lesser degree than lets say U-44770 would. 

I dont think it needs restating that in the pure crystalline form extreme caution needs to be taken. Latex gloves as well as a dust mask, working on a disposable surface like a newspaper are a must. Throw these away.

Being addicted to opioids sucks but its such a relief not having to worry about financing my habit anymore. Its only been three weeks and I could see myself running into problems later down the line but as of now I'm extremely happy with the results. 

Has anybody else had similar experiences?

Dusty (moi, of course)
Dumb
Dumber

Today, I tried to help two people that I swore I would never do business with ever again because they never paid me back on two seperate $30 fronts (within a week of each other), and they frequently threaten me with violence, or worse, causing a scene at my house (Dusty is 25 and lives with his father and younger brother, and only just moved back in with them after being kicked out for things like this).

Twenty minutes after I send somebody to take them a roxy (and a surprise of a free xanax bar for thanksgiving) , they call me and tell me it's fake. I know this is not the case, because I was with the man I bought them from when he got them from the pharmacy. In good faith and attempting to rebuild our relationship, I tell them to bring me the pill and I will do a swap for them. They show up to me with a burnt foil, that a real roxy was obviously smoked on, and no roxy in sight; they decided to ask me for a switch after the smoked it. I tell them we can comprimise and I will smoke one with them, and give them another bar. They are happy with this.

Ten minutes later, I get a call about how it's not fair that I didnt give them a whole pill, and that I need to give them $10 or another pill. I tell them I have no cash but I have a roxy I've only taken two hits of, and to come get it. When they arrive, I tell them to inspect it and be sure they want it before they leave. They inspect, all is good, I start walking home with groceries.

Two minutes later, they track me down in their car, screaming at me about how I gave them another fake. I tell them give it back to me, Ill go donate plasma tomorrow, give them $20, and we can be done forever. Dumb gets out of the car looking ready to fight me, throws the foil with the pill on it onto the ground and stomps it out, and backs me down telling me he doesnt like my smirk. Now they just want $10 from me to get weed because they are ""withdrawing"".

Eventually I give them $10 cash, and they claim they are going to bring me my bars back because they think those are fake too. End of story.

Before you ask why I was such a bitch; it's thanksgiving, and they were more thsn ready to show up at my house, cause problems, and my fathers heart cant take thst stress. Even if we fought about it, they would show up at my house and ruin my home life.

The sad thing is, i think they are truly so dumb that they believe the pills were fake. Either that, or they knew they could squeeze me for all my shit; but I believe the first option, because who stomps out a perfectly good roxy onto the concrete?",1480058300.0

--------------------------------------------------

So I moved out to a new area in 2012, I was 20 at the time and it was the first time moving out of my parents. I worked at a sporting good retailer with this 24 year old that I got to be really close friends with. I mentioned to him that I was looking to move out of my parents, he had an open room at his house with another roommate, badda-bing badda-boom, I move in. At the time I wasn't doing any opiates or hard drugs. I was just into smoking weed. So naturally my new roommate introduces me to his dealer, this dealer is dating a very beautiful 24 year old, we'll call her T. I found out the dealers girlfriend has an identical twin, her name was M. Equally as gorgeous lol. But she's dating some guy and I hardly ever see the other twin. Oh well right? I move on since clearly I wasn't going to make anything happen with T, who was my dealers girlfriend and since I became really close to him, I wouldn't risk our riendship over a chick. And I couldn't make M happen because she was dating some guy and I hardly ever saw her. Fast forward to July 2015, I've got a little bit of a roxy habit and occasionally my weed dealers girlfriend has access to them, so I'm buying a few every other week from her. One day I come over to buy some and she says if I want she'll introduce me to the woman she gets the pills from. I said ""Sure!"" because I wanted to cut out the middle man, and have access to more at a time. So we get introduced, it's a 50+ year old woman who's prescribed ALL KINDS of opioids and other fun stuff, I'm talking some primo-type prescriptions. The best of all the prescriptions though was 120 10mg Methadone pills a month. Now at the time I was putting up minor league numbers right? 2-3 15mg roxy's a day would have gotten me to the perfect level so you can imagine what unlimited access to methadone would do to a man haha. 

Basically I started taking 20mg of methadone a day, I talked her into $6 a pill since she hadn't sold them before, and since I would buy 20 or so at a time she was making enough money to be happy. One day I go over to buy some and I see my weed dealers girlfriend over, I go up like I normally would and say hi, compliment her hair or some bullshit and start small talking. She interrupts me and says ""I'm not T, i'm M"". Oh shit... this is T's twin lol. It's really easy to mix the 2 girls up, they're exactly the damn same. So M and I kind of hit it off, we're sitting at my methadone dealers place, smoking a bowl, couple cigarettes, blah blah. And I've been there for a little bit so I'm like ""Hey I'm gonna head out ladies"" and say goodbye and walk out of the house. M comes out of the front door behind me and asks what I'm about to go do. I was just going to go chill at the house, pop a few methadone and chill out, watch some netflix or play some videogames. She asks if she can come with... holy shit you sexy bitch of course you can (I didn't actually say that part but was thinking it haha). So she hops in my car and we head over to my place. One thing leads to another and we end up spending the next 4 or 5 days together. And when I say together I mean she only left my place for a few hours over the next 5 days to go get some clothes and stuff. It was a blur of sex, drugs, netflix and chillin. Not necessarily in that order though. Now this is a dream come true for me haha. In past relationships drugs have always been kind of a hidden, don't talk about it thing. This was the first girl I'd ever been with that was down with getting properly fucked up. She could handle her opiates as much as I could, which looking back on it now should have been a HUGE red flag, but I was smitten. It was passionate puppy love from the start, and I was experiencing so much emotion that her drug use couldn't have mattered less. So now it's 5 days later, she leaves my place to go home. It was cool with me, it'd give me some time to myself again. One weird thing about her though was she didn't own a cell phone. In 2015 meeting anyone under the age of 26 without a cell phone is a strange fucking occurence but whatever, I'm sure she has her reasons. So when she left I gave her my cell on a piece of paper, with my address and she gave me her home #. A day goes by and I don't here from her, no biggie, I'm not the kind of guy who needs to talk to a chick on an hourly basis or I get paranoid. A second day goes by and I don't here from her. Okay.. I'm thinking this is a bit weird. I just had the best week of my life and I know she was enjoying herself as well, we hit it off like no one I'd ever been with before. 

The 3rd day rolls around and I decide I'm going to call her. I give the number she gave me a ring and this woman picks up with a thick ass eastern european accent. I ask for M and she goes and gets her. We get to talking a bit and I find out M barely remembers a few hour block from each day. She said on top of the opiates that we took together (that I supplied) she was also taking a shit ton of xanax, so she's super sorry but she was blacked out for the majority of the week. Holy shit.. all kinds of thoughts are going through my head. She didn't seem fucked up to me, I've been around benzo's for years and she wasn't slurring, she had no problems recollecting things at the time from what I remember. Anyway we decide to go get lunch and talk about the week. We sit down for lunch and she apologizes for not remembering. I was actually pretty hurt at the time, she said some really sweet things during the week and we BOTH decided to start seeing each other by the end of it. So to hear her say she doesn't remember anything but bits and pieces was horrible. She said she wanted us to be friends and take it from there. Fine. I guess I should put the last week out of my mind because it might as well not have happened. I don't really blame the girl for wanting to take it slow lol. She just had a 5 day blackout in which she spent it shacked up with a guy she barely knows doing a shit ton of drugs and getting fucked left and right.  So we take it slow for another week, still hung out quite a bit, I was still very much into her. So I supplied the both of us with opiates when she was around because I had a daily habit at this point and she enjoyed the drug. When we were both on it things just went perfect, we were both in a good mood, got along really well.. blah blah. So we finally start ""dating"" officially. I'm finding out more about her at this point, she's in the army reserve, has to go in once a month for a weekend but other than that doesn't deal with it much. She does NOT have a job, but she's ""looking"" for one (Wasn't actually looking for shit come to find out later). She lives at home with her parents, she's trying to become a writer and even has a screenplay that is 95% complete. Honestly she could have been a serial killer for all I cared because I was straight in LOVE with this chick. It was something about her being drop dead sexy, a mini-junkie just like me, and her actually showing feelings towards me that made me fall head over heels for her.  3 months go by and everything for the most part was alright. At the time I had a pretty good job and was making about $3k a month, but I was used to just supporting myself and MY habit. Now I have this woman who I love but doesn't work, and does almost as much drugs as I do. So I'm having to pay twice as much as I normally would for drugs, on top of taking us out to eat, and the usual shit. She kept saying she wants to get a job, good. I encourage it a little bit and she pushes back, ""You don't understand I'm appyling for places and no one is calling me back"". I've been in situations where it's hard to find a job so I understand. But I started to cut back on how much I spent on her a bit. I'd make excuses like I had some bills to pay and don't have very much extra cash this week or whatever. I end up quitting my stable, good paying IT job to go start my own business. At this point I'd lost my methadone contact and replaced her with a Heroin contact. Once my methadone connect dried up I went into panic mode and couldn't find a steady supply of opiates through my current connections. Fuck. So what do I do? I turn to the fucking internet, like a dumbass W/D'ing dude would do. I'm tech savvy, so why can't I find drugs online? I hear about people doing it all the time. So after a couple days of searching the bowels of the internet I come across a phone number and a name on an online board. I don't know if I'm about to text a cop or an actual Dboy but I need this drug more than I cared about being a free man apparently so I text them. I would rather have called but the instructions on the board were to text, so I setup a Google Voice number and sent the text.

I get a reply back with ""Whatcha need man? I've got white and tar."" I told him tar, told him how much I wanted and he gave me a price including delivery. Having never bought heroin before I didn't know if it was a good price or not, but I was sick and needed something so I paid. I was still expecting a cop at this point. I was at work at the time so I gave him that address, he texts me when he's outside. I go out and get into his car, he literally pats down my chest for a wire. That eased my anxiety a little bit but shit this was all so sketchy I didn't ease up much. We do the deal, he gives me the dope and I get out of the car and walk toward the office. Every step I'm waiting for the cop cars to swarm in. But they never did, I got inside and after 20 minutes passed I started to realize I just cold called a dude's number I found on the internet and had Heroin delivered straight to my door haha. I was so goddamn excited and relieved at the same time. So that began my H habit, I was smoking it at the time. My girlfriend and I together started spiraling out of fucking control. I was spending $300 for 2 days worth of drugs then we'd run out and I spend another $300. Next thing I know I've run through my entire checking and savings account. I've traded in my xbox one, my PS4, my ps3, my fucking Gameboy DS, EVERYTHING worth even a small amount of cash was sold to pay for dope. So now I'm broke, not only can I not pay rent or utilities but we're sick now to boot. On top of this my girlfriend refused to get a job, and just wanted to focus on finishing her screenplay. In her head, as soon as the screenplay was done all her problems would be solved. She'd sell it to some movie studio and make all kinds of money, be a published screenwriter, and her future would be set. In reality this couldnt' be further from the truth. I'd read the screenplay; it had no substance, no clear story arch, and too many plot holes. I'd never tell M this, she had it in her mind it was exactly how the story should be told and I wasn't going to argue with her. But the constant being sick and arguing over money took it's toll on the relationship. Her parents go out of town for a week and she's housesitting. Her parents place is closer to my office so we just decided I'd stay there with her for the 6 days her parents would be gone. It was an amazing week, we had the cash to stay well and stay high. It was like playing house. We got to sleep in a huge master bedroom of a nice 4200 sq. ft. house. I'd wake up and take a shower, she'd have coffee ready in her parents large kitchen, we'd sit out on the patio, she'd smoke a cigarette and I'd read the paper. In those 6 days we were the happiest we'd ever been. I felt like a real grown up haha, I had my girl in a big house living exactly how I imagined I would. Of course that shit wouldn't last. Her parents came home, I'd already gone back to my place; and were extremely upset with M. She was supposed to have gotten a job by now, they were paying for her to do everything and were sick of it. On top of that, she had failed a random drug test for the Army Reserve. Fucking weed of all things. She was about to be OUT and DONE with the reserve, she had 4 months left and she failed a fucking drug test. They wanted to kick her out, dishonerable and all. She could have fought it, I don't know what really happened with that because we were about to reach a breaking point. 

A few days after her parents came home I get a text from M's twin sister E's phone. It just said ""Hey this is M, I'm breaking up with you"". Before I could even respond the texts just kept coming ""You've never really cared about me... You're a junky... You'd rather spend money on drugs than on me... When's the last time you took me out?... You can't even get it up with me anymore..."" It was horrible, and it broke my heart. I had done so much for this girl, and cared about her more than anything. Either way, she said we were done. So I didn't respond. The next day I wake up to her calling my cell from her home phone. I let it go to voicemail. The VM consisted of her explaining (while crying her eyes out) that she got way too drunk last night and I didn't mean any of it, yadda yadda. She was clearly being sincere but this was my out. I could let this relationship die, and leave it all on her. I loved the girl but we were so goddamn self destructive together it would never have worked out long term. Yeah we may could have stayed together another few months but I needed to stop supporting this girl. Maybe if she didn't have me to turn to everytime she wanted or needed something she would get her act together. Maybe get a job, or at least own up to her Army Reserve responsiblities. So I never called her back. I let our 6 month relationship end right there. But I really loved that woman, and it was my first experience with someone as fucked up on the inside as I was. I'll never do it again though haha. 


After M and I broke up, 2 months later I went to treatment for the first time in my life. That was January 7th of 2016, and I've been off dope ever since. I take suboxone now though, so I guess I'm not really ""clean"". Although I see myself as clean, that's an argument for another time. I see my weed dealer from time to time, he's still dating M's twin sister T. T has always been really cool with me since her sister and I ended. She never really brought it up. I know that M isn't clean and sober, she's still fucking up and still doesn't have a steady job. I haven't spoken to her since November of 15' when she called to wish me happy birthday. But hey, I'm not going to let that hold me down.

If you actually read through this fucking novel then I'm super proud. I hope you enjoyed the story because I did NOT plan on it being this long winded. I just started typing and reliving it in my mind, so all these little details came into my head that I figure were important to the story but really they weren't.

I was friends with this girl D since we were in high school, she was a loyal, tough and spunky girl who was just fun to be around. She had some serious trauma when she was a kid and unfortunately the shadow followed her her whole life. 
D and me were running partners, she was from my old neighborhood and we'd score together all the time. She was fun to be around and made those dopesick car rides on cold days somewhat enjoyable with reminiscing on old memories and singing shitty pop songs from high school. 

I left New York to go to rehab in March and I've been clean since. I spoke to D a few times and it was her usual ups and downs and junkie boyfriends and what-not. Today j woke up to a text saying D had been killed. She was prostituting herself to support her habit and met a guy off CL. They argued about money and he beat her to death with
a hammer. I'm sick to my stomach. Nobody deserves that but especially not D. 

Please guys, don't let this happen to you. Be safe. I understand what we have to do for this habit, I've been in the game for a long time. Be protected if you must turn tricks, tell people where your going. Always follow harm reduction in every way, even beyond the usual things about IV usage. Be safe because out there someone does care about you and would be heartbroken, like I am, if you were killed or harmed.

I did some searching on the net and did not find anything that satisfactorily answered my question so I figured I would try on here.

A couple of things I noticed:

-I always smoke a little bit to gauge the strength of it before I shoot and I noticed it tasted a lot different. Definitely the taste of like burnt sugar. It also trailed kind of red.
-It is harder than tar usually is.
-When I first got it, it was not sticky at all but as several days have gone by it has gotten more sticky, It has, however, not completely melted.

I know some people will sell boiled coke extract as tar and I know it gets cut with burnt and brown sugar sometimes, but is there any way to tell the difference between real tar that is cut to shit and completely fake shit? I tried a little bit but I can't tell if it's placebo effect or if it is real. Also I went and got shit from my regular source so I can't use the whole ""see if you get well.""

I'm 45 days clean in a sober house in the Poconos. Im from the Midwest so I  won't be seeing any family today. I had overdosed early in October and it definitely was a wake up call to me. My parents were pretty freaked out obviously so a few days later I was on a plane to PA to find treatment and stay with my aunt in the meantime.

So here I am in my room typing this wishing I was with my family back home. It's strange though because if I was high and back home I would probably feel even lonelier. I am blessed to be here at least where I'm safe. And I'm in a house with a bunch of great people who are serious about recovery.  Sobriety is not all rainbows and unicorns but I like that I can experience emotions again like a normal person. I can laugh and smile again and for that alone I am thankful.

You can go cold cop but it's not a sure thing: You generally need a number as they are all very suspicious of undercovers. Now I have my rotation of dealers like any junkie of course but none are within. My immediate 5 block radius which is annoying because it means hoping on a train or bus when I need to go cop. 

Anyway I was outside a store smoking a cigarette actually just on my way back from meeting one of my regulars who's a couple train stops north of me. Long story short: Dude approaches me and says tells me he has weed, fishscale whatever.  I say how about boy and he says of course. Trade numbers real quick and it turns out he sells by the gram instead of bundles. I really can't believe my luck. It's pretty hard just stumbling upon dealers who serve weight around here. It's always buns. Also: I never, _ever_ get approached like that because dboys always tell me I look like a cop (whatever that means--when I meet someone new they always insist I snort some in front of them and all that nonesense as if they wouldn't already be in cuffs at that point if I were a goddamn police).

However, I noticed when I stopped working out, changed my diet (eating less), and lost weight (138Ibs) the high doesn't feel the same. It's almost not there for me, even after a tolerance break. Today, my weight is going up, I'm 144Ibs now, and that 10mg Oxy + 1mg Ativan combo is now doing its job this morning. I'm also working and constantly on my feet all day.

I started using heroin back in 2004, after graduation I got into pills, you know the story well eventually I tried heroin and I loved it. Back then you could get a gram for around 20 bucks or so in downtown, now listen this was terrible dope my tolerance before quitting was around a ball a day I never tried the stuff these kids are getting there hands on these days and I'm lucky. I would have probably ended up dead! It wasn't unusual to shoot a gram right after coppin.

I ended up in inpatient treatment 4 times, tried moving across state, went to state ran detox facilities 7 times, was In a 51/50 mental lock up once, I ran the gambent. After trying NA and all that and never making 60 days of being clean, I was in the suboxin program multiple times. I had finally made it, I thought, had a job, a car, was selling OxyContin in 09 and taking subs, had money,women, dope was never sick and after spending 5 hours trying to find a vein one day I just had enough and stopped. I shot the remaining half gram of dope that was mixed in my rig full of blood and frustration into a shoe box full of needles and decided to quit! I had 11 8mg subs, and 3100 dollars under my mattress, and a job still,but had enough of dull needles and endless nights alone. 

I had completely shut myself off from the world at that point no friends,no girl, hell I didn't even serve my customers I was in complete isolation. I was a junkie of the worse kind people, I loved dope I was the friend who everyone always thought took it to far. I had enough, had enough of the nasty feeling the lonely nights and dull needles. 

I was coming off almost a year habit of a ball a day and took those subs 4 of them the first night and 2 for a few days tell they were gone and the next thing I did was attended na meetings every fucking day.

Now do I still attend NA meetings? fuck no, I don't haven't for about 5 years...but let me feed you with a theory:  I needed it then, Na was the most familiar setting to the dope game without the dope that I could find. The crazy people the slutty women (sorry ladies) the drama,  I needed that to keep my mind going for a while. Got in a few relationships the women were crazy even survived a girl I felt I loved who lied,cheated, and stole from me and was high and on drugs in front of me numerous times but I refused to let her fuck my life up again. When she was gone I was heartbroken, found out she cheated on me, I wrecked my car and was fired from my job the same day still refused the life of heroin.

After my 4th day being dope sick I bumped into this homeless women I used to always break off when she was sick,she asked how I was doing I told her I was 4 days sober she asked if I wanted some I told her no, after that day I knew I was done but was tested many times. 

I still remember the obsession of not wanting to be a junkie anymore,but couldn't stop! Numerous times I went to detox, got out went to my parents and felt overwhelmed and that fucking depression sunk in that feeling that I was never going to enjoy life again and within a few hours a friend would be meeting me with a shot up the street, and it always was never that great and I always of coarse would tell myself you just had to get that out of the way, don't let yourself get a habit, and within a week I was stealing receipts out of the garbage at Home Depot and trying to get cash back from some customer service agent who I knew was about to call the cops.

I was once kicked out of a treatment center when I was 19 in Seattle for smoking crack in the treatment center. I was a die hard peeps! Anyways plenty of more stories I could share countless jail visits, dead friends, guns to my head etc....and today after 7 years I have a job that pays around 80k a year,own a home,have a nice car, and it's all almost a forgotten dream.

I remember it all sometimes, and as I sit up at night (can't sleep) I read the posts on here and think of you all! And want every single one of you to know if you want to stop you will I promise you that and if you don't,  do your thing I will never judge you. This is freedom, in this forum you are all real people and I love you all! If your in the PNW, and would like some stories or maybe some help you can PM me...look this isn't a plea to NA or nothing like this. Hell even if you don't want to quit hit me up I'll do what I can.
I'll listen won't judge, I just want to make a difference! I won't give you money to get dope sorry! You should be good enough at that (I was rarely sick when using and no I didn't have rich mommy and daddy) but seriously someone to talk to, Maybe a ride to a job interview?  I'm here I don't attend NA but I still want to help, Whatever I can do let me know, need a meal? Some cigarettes? Naloxone?

I need some help because I honestly feel like I am losing my mind...... thank you for reading this by the way. I don't have anyone I can talk to... for the past month I have been breaking down. A little bit of history on myself.... I have anxiety and have had it in varying degrees for the past ten years now. I am 30/f. I have been addicted to opiates for the past five years too with a nine month suboxone break last year. Dear god do I wish I would have never picked up the dope again. I'm a sniffer and have been relapsed now for eight months. I do about a point a day stretched out over the entire day. About three weeks ago I noticed a twitching in my shoulder blade. My mind immediately went to something horrible like als because it's a sensation I had never felt before and I tend to think the worst. I've been having some pretty bad depressed the last month too and a feeling of impending doom. The twitching has gotten worse over the last weeks and now I have this problem when I go to bed my body feels like it is vibrating. I mean.... it's like my body is vibrating from the inside. In my head and arm and leg... I can't sleep because of it. I have had pretty bad insomnia now for the past couple weeks. Ill lay down and the twitching feeling jusy feels overwhelming. I don't know if it's this bad all day or if it's this bad because I'm trying to sleep at night and that's all I can focus on. I have a history of going to my doctor and thinking I am dying (I will admit to being a hypochondriac) and I don't know what to do now. I don't know if it's the dope causing this or if I need to see a neurologist or anything anymore. I am so lost and I feel broken. And my mind feels so fragile and I know I need to detox off the dope to see if I still twitch without it but I am SO scared..... the dope is the only thing getting me through this like right now I am sitting up because i can't sleep and did some and feel a tiny bit better mentally... but is it aggravating the problem.... I am just lost. :'( it seems like a new place twitches every day. Oh, and I can press my fingers to different areas of my body and feel my pulse clear as day. Even in my ears as I try and put my head on a pillow. I can't actually see any of the twitching but I feel it. I'm just so tired and feel so broken so I am well aware this post is probably very disjointed and rambling... any advice would be very greatly appreciated.

Really have no reason to write this post except to blow off steam. Back in highschool it seemed like bars were starting to become as popular as weed. As a typical polydrug user back then, cool! Fun forgetful nights. However the dark side slowly but surely presented itself to me. I saw friends become complete rage-monsters in their barred out state that had no resemblance except physical to the people I knew before the alprazolam circus came to town. Of course it took me a while to see this because I was using them as well. Not as much as some of my other friends though. 


After highschool I mostly quit doing other drugs except weed and a decent blue/day pull habit. Of course the opiates weren't enough so I added Xanax to the mix. From then I eventually started taking Valium and Xanax all the time and mixing with various opiates. Never fell out, even though the odds were stacked against me. Eventually I found heroin and dropped all the pills completely, just using that brown with the occasional blunt mixed in. 

Just realized this is drawling on longer than I wanted to so I'll fast forward a bit. One evening I decided to see how nice clonazolam could be. 

Fast forward a beer and two blues later, I decide that I am in fact NOT high enough! Neighbor has fent patches? Sounds great!


I stopped breathing for a bit but after my friends throwing water and all sorts of junk, a few hours later I woke up extremely disoriented. 


Fuck benzos.

     Our Dboys stuff is always inconsistent, some days it's amazing, other days mediocre at best. But after holding in my first hit I could immediately feel the onset in my face and shoulders. Usually the rush takes about a minute for me with ""decent"" shit. 
   We finished that on our drive and then smoked a blue as well. I smoked a cigarette in the driveway then immediately threw up. I have a pretty high tolerance even when I haven't done anything for days. I can smoke a whole 100mcg patch in 30-45 minutes without nodding. That was 2 hours ago and I still have a pretty decent body high. I've only smoked heroin for about 6 months but I've been doing opiates for 15 years.
    In those years I've smoked a lot of patches and ate,snorted, and smoked plenty of blues,morph, and OC's. Just curious if it sounds like my dude had actual shit, or possibly a carfentynal cut. I'm in Florida and haven't heard of too much fent cut down here. Sorry for stupid ramblings but I am a bit high.

5exncn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5exncn/some_latenight_ramblings/,6,https://redd.it/5exncn,Hsniffer42,Some late-night ramblings,"In a weird mood tonight, maybe some of you can provide some insight.

So today I was out to lunch with some close friends and I overheard this (good looking, not that it matters) woman who was sitting at the table next to us. I heard her say, ""the problem I have with addicts is that they always blame others for their problem. Like it is no one's fault but your own, so quit bringing down everyone around you"". At first I was like wow what a fucking bitch! She doesn't know my life or my struggle and she can't even begin to comprehend the daily struggles I face.

Then I got to thinking.. whenever i'm sick i'm always ""oh woe, is me!"" and I think I have some real problems compared to everyone else in the world. Actually, I'm going through withdrawals from a drug that I take to make myself feel good. Literally the most selfish thing possible. 

I don't know, and maybe I''m talking to the wrong audience here, but you ever get the feeling that maybe we are just fucking assholes? Like there's the side of it that is all ""Addiction is a disease, the smarter you are the more likely you are to abuse drugs yada yada"". Like we take this drug to cover up some personal issues that, instead of learning to cope, we picked a way of coping that literally just gives us a full body orgasm so we aren't constantly reminded of our personal flaws.

What's the point? Maybe she's got a point.. I don't know. All I know is I've drained two of my bank accounts, broken my mother's heart, and still have the same problems that just get worse whenever i'm not high.. So I get high so i'm not constantly reminded of what a screw up I am.

At thanksgiving I puked before even eating any food from being so high. Later I did puke up the delicious food my mother slaved away in the kitchen making for 3 days. I've puked 3 times today. And here I am feeling all woe, is me because I feel sick because I couldn't deal with putting up with family. On the day that is literally about being thankful for those people i'm doing everything in my power to just tolerate. And they aren't even bad people. In fact I do love all of them very much. So why did I have to get high? Why do I have to get high every damn day and then the biggest problems in my life come from getting high. But I can't not get high (double negatives for daysssss lol).

Well thanks for listening.. Just reevaluating some things and trying to put my situation into a different perspective for myself. Like all i've done is gone black friday shopping and played Pokemon Sun high as shit all day. And when I vomit from being so high i'm all self-pitying. Like fuck I'm doing this to my fucking self. Who the fuck am I to feel self-pity for blowing all my money and time having a full body orgasm. I haven't even had a regular orgasm in literally a month. A change is needed... but it isn't happening tonight or tomorrow or the day after because I just don't want to be sick and I have finals coming up and this and that and a million other fucking excuses. And that is all they are. Excuses. I don't know anymore. Maybe we are just self-righteous jerks projecting our negativity on everyone else when we are sick because we choose to get high instead of deal with our problems. I keep saying ""we"" and ""our"" and ""us"". No it is fucking me, myself, and I and that is the only person I am speaking for. Damn.

Time to get high and continue this vicious cycle looking for a little happiness and confidence in this beautiful life that has been given to me. Why is it so damn hard to just appreciate being alive and the miracle that is the ability to experience and comprehend this experience.. What a life. I don't really expect any advice or pity, I guess i'm just getting my thoughts out to some like-minded individuals. I'm the only one who can fix my problem. And I know how to do it... Now I just have to fucking do it. But nope because *insert bullshit excuse here*

Well this pity train finally reached the end of the track. Hope you all are having a nice day/evening/night/life.

I am lucky to be in a position to experiment and this is just that - an experiment for me. 

So, now , the question: 
I'm opiate naive.

I've tried: 
Dihydrocodeine 90mg
Dihydrocodeine 120mg
Oxy (IR) 15mg

All as a separate experiment of course, not together.

During all I felt slightly 'nodding' for the 90mg DHC (i also had taken an antihistaminic just to be on the safe side as it was my first time, so it's probably that), not much at all during the 120mg, and quasi-nothing with the oxy IRs. 

So, question: I've read this stuff is meant to be hyper-pleasurable and make you feel nice and cosy, personally besides an opiate tension headache and some slight dizzyness I felt absolutely nothing. 

Am I part of the % of people that don't get affected that much by opiates, or am i just not taking enough for them to have an effect?

After 8+ years of casual Percocet use to roxy, Vicodin, heroin (#4 and BT off) and just about everything in between, I bought some China White off the DN. And I ""died"" for 34+ minutes.

I was on vacation to my family, about an hour left in my drive when my partner and I stopped at a McDonalds. I took out my bag from behind my cell phone case(only reason cops didn't find it), walked in the bathroom and poured some out. I remember distinctively going ""that's too much but fuck it"" and blowing a large key bump of what I assume is a fentanyl analogue.

I got in the car and I remember Frank Oceans album artwork blending into my hand, a void and 15 minutes later, shooting out of a hole, with EMT's saying ""You've just overdosed on opioids, you've been given 5mg of Naltrexone. Do you remember your name?""

I can trace my opiate use directly along with the ""opiod epidemic"" that DEA has declared. Percocet as a affluent, white suburban high schooler, roxys soon after, dope in college. After college, losing connections, so turning to the Darknet and ordering shit, comparing prices. Last week I ordered synthetic ""China White"", what I assume is fentanyl. I was dead for about a half an hour, apparently doing the death rattle to my girlfriend for a couple of minutes before the ambulance came.

There's no point to the post. I just needed to tell someone. I've been shitting, puking and cold sweats for 24+ hours now. Any questions? 

Edit: I also wanted to point out, when they told me I overdosed, I just kept saying, no I didn't, I don't do that. Fuck Fentanyl but more importantly fuck my brain for thinking any of my behavior over the past decade is okay. I'm sure Prince, if he had the chance would go, ""no I didn't, I don't do that.""

Edit 2: Sorry my phrasing bothered some of y'all. Waking up in ambulance after you recreational done dope for a decade is scary.  If the ambulance didn't come, I'd have died. My partner was counting the minutes from rattle breath to ambulance. ",1480117521.0

I've been lurking since before I even joined reddit. I used to use heroin and sometimes reading about people's struggles or watching documentaris helps me. 

Anyway, I had a really good friend, Dion. We were best buds though middle school and high school. After high school we'd chill and get drunk/do drugs in my apartment. He joined the Marines about a year after school ended and I didn't see him for about 4 years.

Fast forward to last summer... he cane and ate dinner with my gf (at the time) and I. He brought his wife (who we were in school with) and their little kid with them. I'd been clean for only a few months at that point. Dion had been clean for almost 3 years.

We talked and laughed and had a great time. He eventually moved back home and I moved away (a few states north). I came back home a few months ago and kept trying to make plans with my boy Dion. He kept dodging me for some reason.

I'd heard his marriage was falling apart from a mutual friend. He'd just had a second baby with his wife. Every couple of weeks I'd hit hin up to make plans. Every time it'd fall through.

This morning, I'm browsing facebook, and I see sad messages on Dions page. He died. Last night. Overdosed on heroin. Now I can't sleep and I don't wanna eat or anything. I wish I pushed harder to hang with my boy. But now it's too late. Now my friends and I are calling eachother and crying into our phones. This is so sad.

Euphoria is somewhat blocked but I wake up 12 hrs after last dose of oxy IR feeling barely any withdrawal. This is compared to waking up sick as shit unable to function until dosing. In a week I've demolished my dependence. I will follow this protocol to continue doing inverse titration to completely detox with minimal to zero withdrawal: 

 https://www.scribd.com/book/195139174


If you want NLTX to simply potentiate very effectively your dose, use only 1-5mcg. Always have enough opiates to rescue you from precipitated withdrawal just in case. You should be ok but be aware 1.35mcg on day 1 gave me precipitated withdrawal but only a small dose of heroin stopped it & got me very high. I could take 1/4 to 1/2 the size of line snorted to get me higher than my previous full dose. I would still wake up sick. As I raised the NLTX dose, euphoria and potentiation went down, painkilling effects are still apparent but since euphoria is a part of that, the opiates do feel less strong, but most important and apparent is withdrawals started getting less and less everyday, dramatically so. 


If you follow the inverse titration protocol you can get clean and then if you want to start using opiates again, you can dose your DOC once in morning and then take 1-4.5mg NLTX at night, indefinitely, without ever gaining dependence or feeling withdrawals. The NLTX clears your receptors and if you do this while dependent you will get precipitated withdrawal. If you do this from a non-dependent state, you will get all the benefits but no withdrawal. It takes some time to reach this point though. 

The milligram doses of NLTX will reverse PAWS and boost your immune system, give you up to 300% rebound increased natural endorphin production, as well as contribute to healing of autoimmune conditions and IBS/Chron's, reduce Hep C viral load and increase success of interferon/ribaviran etc drug regimen treatment, prolong health and lifespan of HIV/AIDS patients, reduce fibromyalgia and CFS pain, fight certain types of cancers, and relieve depression. There is also some claims it can keep your HPTA functioning normally during anabolic steroid use. This is all done due to upregulation of endorphin system, the opposite of what chronic opiate use does. These seem like wild claims but there is indeed much medical evidence and tons of anecdotal experiences supporting such. The people who say it doesn't work tend to stop trying only after a short time due to the difficulty of dose titration and finding a sweet spot. It takes alot of individual testing, and if you expect to just take a set dose and be helped you'll likely not succeed. However, if your goal isn't to get clean but to just make your dope go farther, just take 1-5mcg 30 min before your heroin or other drug dose. Take it orally.


Studies have shown ppl using as much as 0.125mg Naltrexone with methadone without getting precipitated withdrawal. The paper above says 0.5mg is ok, but it would take months to reach that stage, and euphoria would be greatly diminished. For some reason though, pain relieving doesn't get dramatically reduced. Probably because there are numerous different types of opiate receptors, and NLTX, in specific dose ranges, only antagonizes and blocks selectively. This could be the answer to addiction issues for pain patients who don't seek a euphoria high. There is lots of promise here, and some pharma company is going to capitalize on it. Oxytrex failed trials due to unrelated to efficacy issues, and I truly believe this is the best way for chronic pain patients to use opiates without getting addicted. For junkies chasing a high, 1-5mcg is an amazing potentiator. You must be very careful as it is easy to overdose. Please make note of distinction between mcg and mg in my post. There is a difference.

I'll make a website selling the solution in mcg and mg doses mixed in propylene glycol or another appropriate carrier. It will be cheap and much less money than any other ripoff source online. People are charging $40 for a little vial when it costs pennies to make. You can do it yourself too. 

I reccomend ULDN to any opiate user, from someone wanting to quit or someone wanting to save money by potentiating doses. It has an added benefit of reducing constipation too.

My question is in regard to snorting ecp. I am a chipper with absolutely no interest in shooting or plugging (no judgement on those who do, just isn't for me at this point in my usage). I just started coming down with some kind of head cold. My left nostril is completely stuffed, right is running away and I'm sneezing pretty often. Oh, and I have 2 buns just staring at me on my mirror. I tried to snort a little bit, almost puked with half a line, then very softly snorted 2 more lines. Then a bunch of heroin-tasting snot poured from my nose. Am I just wasting my stash by trying to snort it with a runny nose? Do you guys have any tips (save for plugging or shooting) that might help?

I tried explaining to him that methadone is made for heroin withdrawal , and its will blast up his tolerance, etc , mostly just trying to scare him to not take it but he is so stubborn he thinks its the same as every weaker opiate hes taken. I know he will be fine if he takes them, I just don't think he realizes what methadones are actually used for. I could use your guy's wisdom in this area to convince this kid (who's a very mild user) that methadone is not the best idea.

My mother's used to be online gambling but now she just plays backgammon. 

My sister however is like a cavalcade of substance abuse. Mixing Xanax and alcohol with her daily Vyvanse and the occasional roll on top (pokeball quadstacked alledgedly) what I'm getting at about her is that she gets kinda manic. 

And on Thanksgiving she was no exception. I personally don't think she did anything wrong or out of the ordinary for herself, jetting around trying to accommodate everyone in the house in a conversation. Which must have made everyone think she ways tweaking hard.

The next day though my mother told her that she was an alcoholic who needs to go to rehab right then and ultimatly that she ruined thanksgiving. Which the kicker really is that it was her birthday and my mother followed it up with ""I don't want to do this cause it's your birthday""

So now she's bawling to me about how I'm lucky that I just smoke weed and fly under the radar. She's just saying super depressing things about being lonely and how our family is so distant and that she's being singled out, and I feel like I should be like ""yo I'm not so great myself"" but I also feel like letting her know I have a heroin addiction won't play well in my favor.

Have any of you been upfront with your siblings?

Side note, my neice is in the ICU with Steven Johnsons disease which causes your epidermis to separate from your dermis and your retinas to scloose back into your head , so when we visited her on Thanksgiving she handed me her PCB?

What was your longest period of abstinence? Roughly how much time altogether have you spent opiate-free, since you started? What's your DOC? What opiate did you start with? 

Just a few conversation-starters that recently crossed my mind. I'm sure these questions have been asked here before, but it seems as though our community is growing/changing daily. Plus these are questions anyone can answer, hopefully bringing a few lurkers it from the shadows. 

My first opiate high came in the form of those fat ass Watson 525s. 
About 5.5 years ago, a close friend of mine had over 200 of those fuckers (5mg hydro, and a couple hundred mgs acetaminophen) and was happy to trade me 60 of them for a small amount of high quality marijuana. I fell in love instantly, but told myself I'd never do heroin and end up like my dead beat dad.
 
I'd toe the line of acetaminophen poisoning, eating as many at a time as Google/erowid deemed ""safe""-2 days on, then 3 days off so as to avoid dependence/withdrawal. In that respect I ""successfully"" used all 60, and another 50 or so without ever experiencing any ill effects. 

Fast forward a year or so later, my best friend made the jump from oxy to heroin. I was never interested in those little blue pills, but something about those neat-o $10 glassine bags with the morbidly funny stamps on them really piqued my curiosity. I asked my old pal to pick me up a few, and thus began the downward spiral that is my life. 

I still managed to snort heroin somewhat infrequently throughout the following year without experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, but it did occur to me on multiple occasions that I enjoyed this high a little too much. After eventually developing an every-day habit, tolerance started to build and money began to run out. My running-partner/using buddy at the time was an IV user, so when I only had enough $ for 2 bags one day, I asked him to show me the way of the needle. That was roughly 4 years ago. 

Less than 6 months later, I was detoxing in the county jail. After a 2 month stay, I was released to a residential drug treatment program where I stayed sober for a grand total of about 10 months, and another month or 2 opiate-free upon completion of said program. That was my longest period of continuous sobriety is my 5+ years of using. (almost one year)

Because life seems empty and not worth doing sometimes,"Even with respect to such street addicts, however, there are differences of opinion. The 1956 British Columbia report, for example, observes that the, typical street addict finds in heroin

a purpose in an otherwise purposeless life. The activities of the drug addict become a full-time job. Formerly living with no real objective, with indolence and unemployment perhaps intimately related, the addict now finds he has to hustle. If he is going to use drugs steadily he must End each day, by illegal means, the funds for the purchase of his drugs. This usually involves daily thieving, the sale to a ""fence"" or to beer parlor habitués of the goods he has stolen, the locating of a drug peddler, negotiating for his supply, then the actual securing of the drugs at a designated time and place, followed by the locating of a presumably secure place where be can inject his drugs and rest and relax for several hours after the injection. He may take his last injection of the day at midnight, having in reserve a supply for his first ""fix"" the following morning oil awakening. A program such as this keeps the addict busy all day. He has no time for boredom. He has barely time enough after each injection to enjoy the effects before he may have to start another phase of this cycle. In other words, the addict now has a job, a full-time job ... not governed by regular hours as is most legal employment. 20",1480305333.0

I made an account recently because I felt a connection to a specific post that led me to comment on it. /endscene

I found a new dboy today through an old employee who stopped in to say hi. I asked if he knew anyone who provided a service to sell benzodiazepines. he hooked me up with a guy, who was very weird, but in a heartwarming way. he was not sketchy, was not debating prices, just wanted to test the waters to see if I was legit or a piece of shit (I mean what is the difference, right?).

he delivered to my job and came through with exactly what he promised as well as hilarious commentary while my fiance waited for him to show up (he works with me part time) he seems legit, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to find a new plug. but...

ecp is my drug of choice. I'd choose heroin over benzos any god damn day. but with this fent fiasco, I'll admit I was scared. I was just scared to score the drug I wanted... but I wanted to let this dboy off easy, and acted a bit apprehensive to make a deal with someone new. ""yeah man, benzos sound great. thanks a lot!""

my question is... when do people become comfortable in asking their dealer for something more? something more ""hard."" I'm so torn right now. I don't want to scare him off, but I don't want to lose the business, y'know?

either give me a paragraph telling me to fuck off or slap me in the face and be real, I just need some advice on how quickly I can approach asking a dealer I met less than 24 hours ago for that good boy.

thanks for reading, and here is an obligatory thanks for reading, any advice will be greatly appreciated. nod on, friends!

EDIT: I usually get ecp 30 minutes driving from me, but the guy doesn't deliver. so before you say, ""just go to your original connect!"" just know that I have a moped restricted license, and can't necessarily drive my moped in the snow to get my fix. this is my first delivery boy available, so I want to make the best of it.",1480297966.0

I've never found a for sure answer as to if this is complications with the drugs? or if they overdosed? i plan on taking opiates for a while at least and i just don't want to keep going not knowing if i could just end up dead at any second.

**TL:DR my questions are** 

* When people die while on opiates, is it *ONLY* because of an overdose?

* Is it possible for me to just keel over one day while within safe limits of dosing?

* If i have no past medical issues involving Opiates, should i be safe using them on the weekends and only the weekends as long as i stay within reasonable limits?

So it started Friday, I was supposed to get two points from my dgirl and she drove to my place and was going to drop it off, however when she got here my dad was outside with me (I live at home because I'm going to university but also because I'm epileptic so I need rides and also, moving back home was part of the deal of my parents bailing me out of jail) so I told her she had to hold on a minute. She started getting mad because she had to wait. Anyway, we make the deal I go inside and am talking with my dad for a minute, grab a straw and go to the bathroom. I bust it open (where I live we don't get bth or China white but the other powder, I'm on mobile so I can't tell what # it is) and I see that it's greenish. Normally the shit she gets is rocked up H with a very light tan color so I already knew something was off. I start googling and found that H with a green tint is usually a fent mix and I start freaking out. So I text her and let her know. She says she wasn't paying attention and accidentally gave me a package of X meant for someone else and that she'll come by later and make it right and also toss a little extra on top. So I'm thinking she meant that night. Well, at this point I had already been without any opiates for 2 days and wasn't suffering too bad. Well, she left for Georgia and I was supposed to leave for a wedding yesterday with my dad. So I wake up and I'm suffering full withdrawals, mine are SUPER sniffly nose, diarrhea, etc. So I'm basically feeling like I have the flu, and me and my dad had already left and I realize I'm not going to be able to make it to this wedding so I get him to drop me off back at our house. I get there and realize I actually am suffering withdrawals because at this point I thought I was coming down sick. So I run to another boy I have to pick up something and he tells me all he has is Rs so I pick one up, immediately take it and within 15 minutes I'm already feeling loads better. Made me realize that I've gotten to a point that I've got to stop. Or at least seriously cut back.

Now I have a somewhat decent habit, and I went to drink and drank maybe 1/4 of glass before realizing what she had done.  I could taste the nastiness of the pill.  So not being a stranger to pw I sat back and waited for the show to start.  Went from a nice nod to sick.  Now the sickness wasnt too terrible.  It was not a full blown case of pw, but it was enough to make my stomach cramp horribly and vomit twice throughout the night.  Im guessing I ingested less than 10 mg.  The worst of the pw only lasted maybe 8 hours, major symptoms subsiding around 3 4 in morning.  I had one bag left and ,decided to save it till 12 pm today.  The bag had basically zero effect, maybe leveling me out just a little bit.  I just picked up again, used 1 bag then used 2 around 2pm.   No rush but I did actually catch a nod.  My question to you guys is, how long do you think it will take for full effects of naltrexone to subside.

I was treated for chronic pain since I was very young. Been smoking weed hard and slamming edibles since the first day I found it, always been helpful. I never know where to draw the line between use and abuse.    
  
After I tried absolutely every medical treatment under the sun with no improvement, I went to college with my first script of hydro and spent the entire time either running the bathroom throwing up or nodding out falling asleep on myself. After a nasty experience with a 25ug fentanyl patch which had me waking up vomiting and shaking, I was pretty sure this wasn't the right move to keep taking opiates. But I was moving better, so my family urged me to continue. I switched to oxy, high was worse, nausea was better. I totally lost myself on those pills, 24 hours a day on opiates really started to fuck with me. They settled on morphine and ramped up the dose to 90mg a day and I started to get more suicidal. It was bad how many times I told my family I was going to do it, swallow all the pills. I wanted desperately to be off those pills. The withdrawls were worse than anything, I would get so constipated i couldn't take them for a few days and just wanted to die the whole time.   
  
Finally my doctor told me to choose pot or pills. I chose pot, and I'm glad I did. Honestly I was relieved. Went through the withdrawls in their entirety, he gave me 10 days and i went off in 5. I was horribly suicidal and desperate for the pills back. But it ended in a week and half. After that ended I grabbed two bags of Kratom and used it spraringly up to today. There are some days when pot doesn't cut it. Or am I just addicted still? I feel like an ass. I never knew what it was like to be not fucked up all day. Since the beginning I would take days when I wouldn't take anything and force myself to keep going, and accomplished nothing but screaming. But now that 4/7days a week are without medicine, my life is miserable. I can't do anything I like, I hate everything I have to do, and it's just going to get harder. I wish desperately that I could die but I couldn't do that to my family and my girlfriend. I'm glad I don't have any opiates in my house or dorm, as killing myself would be harder, but I feel like those pills sucked the fucking life out of me. I don't know what I'm really saying, I just wish my life was different. I wish I could get to the gym every day and feel better, my muscles atrophy and die every day, but I can barely get out of bed most days. With those pills I was working out hard and feeling better, not mentally, I was fucked out of my gourd, but I was moving. I hate the pills, but I hate the pain.

It is now 2:38AM. I am still high. I took 5mg for my first dose, and will not and have not redosed because of the potential for OD when one does.

If you do this, take a small dose, 2.5mg or 5mg (for those with no active opiate tolerance), and wait a few hours. You get high around 2 hours after administration, and then at about 4 hours, you hit the peak of the high.

At this point I got very warm and had to step outside for a walk and a cigarette because it was a strong, disorienting high. Do not be alarmed. This passes really quickly, just make sure to keep yourself active whenever you feel the need to. I have a pretty late (almost tweakerish) sleeping schedule, so I decided to stay up and enjoy the heavy buzz, listening to the Velvet Underground and anything opiated I could imagine. Seems 'Heroin' really boosts the experience for you fellow degenerates in the crowd.

Sry just rambling. That's one good thing about this drug. It's a strong opiate downer but you also feel up. I have been smoking weed all evening and whenever I do, this seems to catapult the high a little bit.

I meet this one lady who was very open that she used to be a H addict and what not. I had not used a PK for the past 5 months. Her and I both smoked cig so we would always go out for a smoke together. Well today I had happened to have 6 xanax bars on me and I asked if I could trade a couple of bars for a couple of her Subutex. Me being the old user I am been straight away went to the bathroom at my work and smoked half a pill thinking I would be straight.

Man was I wrong. I had to force my head up and then convinced the lady next to me that I was not feeling well. I was nodding so hard mothafuckas wanted to fine me. The lady who gave me the Subutex was downstairs and when she saw my get an uber back home she smiled.

(x-post from /r/drugs),"**I am serious about this question, the only reply I got on /r/drugs was kind of silly. If I need to, I (or a moderator) can delete the one on the other subreddit! The question IS related to opiates. I am wondering if testing positive for methamphetamine will be an issue for me starting my Suboxone replacement therapy!

So while I knew that I was going to be requiring a urine sample a week or so before I go in for my first Suboxone meeting with the doctor, I had no idea that they would be testing for methamphetamines. I just recieved the paperwork to bring to the clinic (for both blood and urine sample) and it says that they are testing for meth as well.

Now, during my first assessment with the counsellor I stated that I had never done it before, but I was very adamant that one of the reason I haven't began a taper myself is that I was always uncertain of a)the quantity that I was getting, b)the quality, and c)what the hell I am actually am buying as ""heroin""/dope (I even made a point -pun not intended- that the bags i get have sometimes been different colors, and sometimes burn at different consistencies).

To sum it up, I've got two questions: (*note: I finished my last tiny bit of a $10 bag at 9PM today [Monday], and I should be taking the pee/blood test at 4:30-5pm on the 30th [Wednesday]). 

1) How long does it stay in your system for a very new user (total of maybe 10 times), and that i've been using only a $10 bag a day, for maybe 2-3 days in a row. I did read online that they say up to 72 hours, but my situation may be a bit more specific due to my low usage, my short amount of time used, and my incredibly fast tolerance (btw, i've got an incredibly fast tolerance). Obviously opiates are no worries if they come in the blood test, and its almost good to come up positive for all the (opiate) crap I've been taking.
    
2) What happens if it comes positive? Am I at risk of prolonging the induction phase? Honestly I don't feel as though I need it to continue, so any further tests here on afterwards would show negative. I was thinking that I could always play it off as ""oh I had no idea what is in the bags I buy... The powder is usually white and they say its 'China White', but I always thought its was some kind of fentanyl, given the transparent colour/opacity it creates when burned, and the lack of residue it leaves behind; good thing i didn't try and taper off myself guys, huh?!"" --> Would this be an acceptable answer? Im kind of freaking out, I honestly had no idea they would be testing for amphetamines otherwise I would not have bothered!

**TLDR: I am starting Suboxone therapy first by the 6th of December. They require a urine and a blood test 7 days prior (the 30th of Nov) and I found out they test for EVERYTHING. I used very tiny amount of meth Nov 25-28 ($10 a day), will it show up on a non habitual user (10 time total in past 5 months, no more then $20 a day), with really fast metabolism, that looks a lot younger then he is (if it matter?) What happens if it does appear?**

I have been on a maintenance program for 5-6 years now. Usually 8mg sub per day but last year I bumped up to zubsolve 8.6mg = 12mg sub for my daily dose.

In this time especially most recently I began using other hard drugs again (in some moderation). My two drugs of choice ATM are benzos (Valium and Xanax bars) and stims (crystal or Coke). I have found that my tolerance to other drugs has gone up two fold since starting on bupe program. Just recently I got into crystal, product was fire according to all who tried it but I could never get enough to tweak. Every ROA had this issues, I would IV 250mg doses and still want more while my buddy would do 100mg and tweak for days. I do firmly believe my high tolerance is due to long term use of bupe, And that taking bupe after dosing other drugs does reduce those drugs effect. In fact I take bupe and Xanax to come down off Coke binge and it's amazing how well it works to cut cravings and honestly the affects of the other drugs on me. 

IMO bupes one of the strongest drugs I have ever taken. I have used a 8.6mg zubs to kill an acid trip and fall to sleep within 2.5 hours of dosing, short of a extremely heavy Xanax dose idk much other drugs that would do the same and was surprised it worked.

My question is to any of those who have been on a long term bupe program have you found that it effected your tolerance to other drugs? I'm not even going get into THC, if it's not a dab I can't even fuck with that. There's no solid info on this out there and I'm only speaking on my own personal experiences and few other stories but I wanted to see if others in this community have had similar experiences?

It hurts deep in my heart
I've just watched everything dear to me fade away into the background, but I didn't feel it, I've been so numb
It has all faded to the point that I don't seem to care that these things are gone

People I used to want to see...
Things I used to love to do...
Dreams I used to want to see through...
And I sit here in tears, trying to pin-point the moment or event or reason all of it is no more
It's a pointless exercise, I know, but something inside me is convinced that identifying that reason/event/moment will somehow solve the problem, or if not, at least kick start the recovery of at least some of those things I so deeply desire to have back
It's not like I have nothing...
I traded my hobbies and talents for a mindless existence, social interaction for a dark room all the way in the back, that I ""jokingly"" refer to as 'the cave', and these material things? They were traded for embarrassingly low amounts of money that was immediately exchanged for the root of every problem I'm experiencing
Ultimately I traded ""living"" for a needle and an elusive powder, that seemingly disappears before my eyes, if it weren't for the 100;s of tiny balls of cotton all over, I'd be convinced I was a great magician 
So why the fuck am I still trying to find what and/or when it went wrong?

I have been on suboxone for three years. Before that it was oxy, hydro, methadone, etc. Basically whatever I could get. I settled on bupe because I am a functioning addict and by keeping my dose around 1mg/day I could get a mini buzz and feel the comfort of opiates while maintaining my life and job without any suspicious family or friends. One might say, "" Hahahahha 1mg/day is nothing!"" But after a few years quitting cold turkey is the pits. If it were just a few days or week of sore body, malaise, nausea, cold symptoms, depression, oh, and NO SLEEP, then it wouldn't be so bad, but the withdrawals from buprenorphine last over a month, some of the symptoms for longer... Those who have been down this road know. Anyways, my point is:

By switching to 25g of Kratom per day broken up into 5 doses one can escape all of the pain and suffering that comes from jumping off the ops. For suboxone one must do this for 3-4 weeks to get passed the withdrawal symptoms but after that you just start cutting back on kratom a little. Thats easy because it's a pain in the ass to swallow the stuff and it tastes like butt. As the symptoms diminish so does the urge to swallow a bunch of nasty plant powder, but look! All the symptoms of your old addiction are gone and you can BE FREE! 

Of course if you're me that means it's time to mess around with the subs again but now I know the secret, and so do you. They almost outlawed Kratom a month ago and I discovered it two days before that. I scored a kilo of some white leaf for $100 and it lasted a little over a month. I recommend picking up some kratom and stashing it in a dark dry place. One day you might find yourself in serious opiate withdrawal or perhaps you will be wanting to finally kick the habit. This is a safe a d reliable way to do it without going to hell and back. You might even find that the kratom gets you high! 

As always be safe when enjoying your favorite party favors and know that you make the rules, not the drugs. Peace.",1480383557.0

I wake up from a semi-peaceful slumber to the overpowering urge to score some dope (go figure.) Having been clean for two weeks prior to this day, it took an extra one second's hesitation before I started calling everyone I had ever met that even looked like they may have tried heroin at one point in their life. I was ""between connects"" if you will, as my main plug had dropped off the face of the earth. Cue the entrance of a middleman I hadn't spoke to in a while, but used to call quite often.

This event occurred during the suspension of my license (3 1/2 years ago) which is another story for another time. I was living about 45 minutes driving time from the nearest city, and that is where this middleman's contacts reside. My home at the time was in the middle of the woods (literally,) so I called up a friend of mine that I had middled for. I had already contacted my middle, and my friend picked me up a few minutes later. Around an hour later I had a ball of heroin in my hand, and a minute later I had a loaded rig. Before I searched for a vein, the middleman told me that a friend of his had overdosed a few days before this, and that this dope is strong. This middle always talked about how strong the dope he gets is, and the last few times I had picked up through him had been very lackluster. Assuming this dope was no different, I loaded up a quarter gram and got ready to blastoff. 

I was conscious for all of one minute after I hit the vein and shot. ""Wow this stuff is strong"" I exclaimed, while quickly ascending into the most powerful high I have ever felt. Then...darkness...and a tranquility with undertones of confusion. The next thing I saw was a collection of EMT's and LEO surrounding me. I felt a great pain at the top of my skull, and was given assistance in standing up. The middleman was in the position facing a brick wall right in front of me, despite my state's good samaritan laws. The LEO were pretty rude, but either the EMT's or one of the LEO saved my life, so I wasn't too salty about it. They asked me what the last thing I remembered was, and I said ""pushing down the plunger."" Everyone of them started laughing.

""How does your head feel?"" asked one of the LEOs. ""Alright I guess,"" I replied, despite a splitting headache. They informed me that my ""friend"" that was driving had pushed me out of the car after I had overdosed, and proceeded to take off. So there I was, laying on the curb, dying as fast as I possibly could. My middleman guardian angel called 911, swallowed the 1/2 gram he was holding, and assumed the position. Before this incident, I would only consider him an acquaintance, but now we are close friends. I never would have thought that this guy, who was only in the same car as me so he could get high himself, would put his own freedom at risk to save my life. Turns out this middleman was a real decent person, and the guy I thought was my friend turned out to be a piece of garbage.

""Wait a second Fitz, you only shot a 1/4 gram of that 8 ball,"" you may be thinking. ""I wonder what happened to the rest."" Well the driver took off and the dope ended up on the floor of his car (It was in my lap but bagged up.) Once I got to the hospital I realized the dope wasn't in my pocket. When I got out I called the driver multiple times, and got no response. I continued calling him throughout the night with no answer. Early in the morning he texted me saying that he did not see my bag anywhere. My middle informed me that he went through my pockets before the cops showed up, so I was pretty sure the driver was full of shit. Either way, he pushed me out of his car, which is something I would never do to anyone regardless of our relationship. Needless to say, I was fucking pissed.

I'm not sure if the driver just assumed I wouldn't try to recover my dope, or if he was planning on me dying/getting arrested. Either way, I was alive and sober, which is no way to live if you ask me. The driver must have been banking on me not having wheels/not remembering where he lived. Unfortunately for him, my middle (and new good friend,) picked me up, and you better believe I remembered where he lived. I forgot to mention that my phone was in my lap, and he tried to drive off before my middle could grab it (it had hit the floor at that point.) So even if my drugs were not in this asshole's car, I would still most definitely owe him a visit for leaving me to die. The two of us roll up to the driver's house, and I see his car in the driveway. I tell my buddy to park down the street, and I get out and walk towards the dude's house. His car is in the driveway, and its locked. Luckily for me I've got a skeleton key: my elbow. I smash the kid's passenger window (I was sitting in the front,) and it takes me all of 30 seconds to find the dope in his glovebox. I am ecstatic at this point, ready to get high, and about to book it back to my friend's car. The driver heard the window smash and ran outside.

At this point I am starting to get a bit worried as I am a little dope sick, which is not a good condition to be in for a fight. The driver comes out of his house with his arms thrown up in the air, sporting the classic ""what the fuck?"" look. I get ready to fight for my right to party, when I notice a flash in my peripheral vision. My friend had been watching the whole thing, and was barreling towards the driver that left me to die. Before I know it, my friend tackles the fucker, and they both end up grappling on the ground. I run over, the fight obviously turns in our favor, and we rough the dude up a bit. A minute or less later we are running back to my dude's car, geeking out. We both knew we were about to get high, and adrenaline was coursing through both of our veins at that point. I proceeded to split what was left of the dope with my buddy, as he not only helped me recover the dope, but saved my damn life the night before. I took it real easy on that bag, and after that I was always real careful anytime I picked up.

The moral of the story here is: Be careful, and always do test shots/lines. If this guy hadn't turned out to be the great person that he is, then I would not be here to tell this tale today. Oh wow I almost forgot the best part. My girlfriend at the time (ex now,) was in the hospital getting a fairly simple procedure done, but it required her to be there overnight. I was living in a pretty small state at the time, so there weren't all that many hospitals close to me. As ""luck"" would have it, we both ended up at the same hospital. I never told her about this, and we kept dating for a few years after. The hospital kept me there to monitor me for 3-4 hours, and during that time my gf sent me a ""hospital selfie."" During my brief stay at the hospital I was pretty freaked out that she was going to see me there, but luckily she did not. This is the first time I have said/written anything about this experience. Now, having been clean 8 months, I feel very guilty about the whole experience. I almost want to call her and tell her all about it, but obviously that isn't going to happen now that we aren't together. We dated for a little over 5 years, and were very close. She put up with my addiction for at least 4 years, and I can't believe she never broke up with me during that time. I hope that someone is able to learn something from my stupidity.

5foxhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5foxhj/question_for_heroin_addicts_who_have_truly_gotten/,25,https://redd.it/5foxhj,CrystalJihadi,Question for heroin addicts who have truly gotten clean,"Been doing a lot of thinking lately and wanted to ask those of you who have really got off the dope and stayed sober, what worked for you? Most addicts who I know who got off either became addicted to or obsessed with something else (meetings, or another drug, or god). For me, everytime I have tried the emptiness and depression never goes away. Yes it does get ""easier"" but I was always forcing myself to get up and do things like people are supposed to, but still was a ghost of a person. Tiny things like getting up and showering, going out, etc were always still difficult. Still no true motivation. 

I've come to have noticed that although all addicts end up in the same abyss, the way they got there seems to affect how much they are able to truly escape it. There are those addicts who ended up addicted because they tried it a few times with friends, did it more and more with the crowd, and then wake up one day in full withdrawal and have a problem without knowing they had one. Then there's those addicts who are addicted to anything as long as they have something. But then there's the ones who, for lack of a better description, live and die for heroin. For me, when I first tried it, it was like ""this is the feeling I've been searching for my entire life, everything is finally ok"". And I went down that slippery slope to hell fast, knowing what I was doing and not caring. Not caring thay rock bottom would most likely be jail and death. My friends who were addicts who weren't that way got clean and managed to stay clean. 

I've been through trying rehab, suboxone, methadone, cold turkey, NA, but nothing has ever stuck for me. At meetings I'd mostly just like to listen to people's stories. In rehab i would feel awful because there were all these people whose underlying reasons for using were very clearly abusive pasts and horrible events and extreme mental illness. But i grew up with a financially well off, loving and caring family, all my siblings are functioning adults who know what they wanted to do in life. Then there was me with seemingly no reason to be like this. Personally I have never been able to jump aboard the god or higher power train. And I know there's a lot of you out there who can't either. So I'm just wondering, how did you guys manage to stay sober? Did the emptiness and ridiculous effort and boredom of trying to function in normal reality ever really go away? 

I do not mean to offend anyone by this post or try to say any addict is better than any other. If the things i have mentioned did work for you then i am glad to hear it. These have just been things I have thought about and come to notice over the years. Would just love to have anyone's input.

I wander across the wet pavement, the wet grit under my shoes making an awful sound that scratches at my ears. But I go further.

Across the seas of concrete and asphalt Im alone at this hour, the cold rain pelting everything around my umbrella with a dull splatter that drowns out all other noise. 

As the rain falls harder around me, I feel the world is trying to wash the filth in this city away. Still, it persists, the reek of shit and urine wafting from doorways now void of anyone. Where humanity has left its mark remains.

Further I go, past the concrete to the green, lush slopes of the river. Down a dirt path, past tents and tarps obscuring faces that study me silently. Further even, down the mud path, the patter on the leaves and the large drops that tumble from them roaring in the silence. 

At the waters edge I sit on my culvert, my throne of contemplation. On this throne I fold up my umbrella and set it aside. The rain pours over me, soaking me to my very core as I close my eyes and relax. 

My thoughts slow, and eventually stop as my mind comes to peace with itself. I feel the water run down my face, my body, I feel it soak me. I feel it try to wash away the stink of my soul, I will it to erode the evil I've done and the hurt and hatred inside. 

But just like the piss and shit behind me, the rain will never cleanse it. As I feel my body cool and shiver in the deep night, I stand and turn to begin the walk home. As dirty as ever.

So anyways, several months ago, I went to a detox in my city that does a quick bupe taper. They do 4mgs morning and night for two days, then 2mgs morning and night for two days, then 2mgs once about midday on day five, have you skip a full day, and then a final dose of 2mgs on what would be day 7. 
Now, I can't afford to go back through a detox or anything, but I managed to get about 10mgs of suboxone (1 and 1/4 of the 8mg suboxone pills). I'm thinking I can get by with 2mg a day (will have to be snorted for maximum effect) for 4 days, skip a day, see how I feel, maybe take 1mg that following day, and gage it from there. I can't get anymore subs. And I am just overall done with this game.

My question is: has anyone had any luck with a similar quick taper sub/bupe plan like this? I know the mental part will be a bitch, but I'm pretty sure I can deal with it. I'm just ready to be done. So what do you think? I know that it won't be magically all better, but will it at least remedy the worst of my withdrawals? 

I know a lot of people say that once the subs wear off, I'll be back at square one, but after watching people go through this at the detox I was at, I just don't think that's the case. I mean, it's possible, but won't it at least cushion the vast majority of it all?

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to track down some xanax as I type this.

For the record, my tolerance is pretty high, but I have managed to wean it down quite a bit over the last few days, to the point where I think that I should be stable by day two on the subs.

Is this method actually reliable?,"Oxy and pst are my typical DOCs but I am trying to wean off the pst so I considered trying a cheap alternative I usually turn my nose up at. The idea of fucking with those gross apap/caffeine/whatever the fuck else pills always seemed sketchy to me and the possibility of aspirin/tylenol poisoning was not worth the limited codeine buzz (I have pretty low tolerance so would probably get something out of it). Normally I just stick to percs but I was in the pharmacy for something else the other day and I decided to get  a bottle of AC and C. Was no real trouble really, I did have to provide some info about my leg which is in legit pain which I could theoretically be buying these for. Tonight though it's cause I'm curious about trying it as an alternative to PST. I've drank CWE perc solution with pop before and had a good time.

Previously I'd never seen the point in fucking with this shit cause of the caffeine but I read about this method using an oral syringe and a folded paper towel as a filter. Basically load the crushed up pills into the syringe, add cold water, put the plunger in and squeeze the water out. The person who posted about this method claimed it removed the caffeine as well as the aspirin but I could find little in the way of an explanation of how that would be true. If there was a bit of a caffeine buzz still I could probably live with it but I am more concerned about how effective this would be for actually getting the aspirin out and how much of that shit I would be consuming if I used 20 pills like this method suggests (160mg of codeine, hardcore I know lol). 

Anyway just curious if anyone ever tried this in a state of desperation or to avoid withdrawal or just out of curiosity. How well does this syringe column extraction thing work for AC and C pills? Are there finer points of the process I'm missing? 

And yes, I know this is some weak ass shit I would be consuming. Just curious what my options are with a low tolerance and these things cheap and OTC here. Might as well take advantage. For $7 figured it would be worth a try. I know this wouldn't even get a lot of people here well, I say this to preempt the incoming posts notifying me of this. It's ok, I know you're cool :)

Medical Attention IS still Needed After Using Narcan !!IMPORTANT!!,"I have been noticing people talking about using Narcan after an OD and then not seeking medical attention... I posted this 2 months ago, time to reshare it. 
====================================
Hey Guys/Gals, this is a Public Safety Announcement.

A lot of people go with the misconception that after an Overdose, if you use Narcan on someone, they are good to go and safe. THIS IS WRONG! Someone who has overdosed and had Narcan administered by someone, needs to seek immediate medical attention afterwards to be monitored. 

**Half-Lifes:**
>>The Half-Life of Heroin = 3.6 Hours
>>>The Half-life of Narcan/Naloxone = 30 to 81 minutes.

If you do not know what half-life is, the half life is the amount of time for half of a drug to be eliminated from your system. The half life of Heroin 30 minutes, during which it breaks down into Morphine. Morphine's half-life  is 3.6 hours, meaning every 3.6 hours a half of the drug is excreted. 

So let's use a half gram of Heroin as an example.  3.6 hours after dosing, .25 is left in the system. At 7.2 hours, .12 is still in a user's system. 10.8 hours after dosing, .06 is left.  So on and so forth.

Narcan's Half-Life. Initial dose .4mg.  30-60min after dosing, .2mg is left in the system. At 60-120min, .1 is still in a user's system.  90-180min after dosing, .05 is left.  As you can see, Narcan/Naloxone's half-life is much shorter than Heroin/Morphine.

**Okay to break down how it would work with Heroin and getting Narcanned.**

You shoot up a half gram. You have gone over. Someone has administered Narcan to you. They bring you back. You are pissed, but scared, you do not do any more dope even though you feel like shit. But 30 minutes later you are starting to feel super high again. an hour after you were narcanned you are out again. You die, because Narcan is expensive. If you had gone to the hospital, they would of continued to administer Narcan every 30 minutes for 4 hours to make sure all the Heroin has reached a low enough level in your system, so it wont incapacitate you again.

*To explain it in TL;DR*
The legs on Narcan are much much shorter than the legs on Heroin, if you have overdosed and have been given Narcan, you still need to get medical attention.

**Another important note, with the popularity of Fentanyl and Carfentanil as a cut, the amount of Narcan you have on hand may not be effective in reversing an opioid overdose. Contact Emergency Services (911) immediately if suspected or Narcan is not bringing the person back.**

I've become really depressed and the only thing that helps is using. I have money for it but I usually go completely broke a few days before my paycheck is depositied and I end up eating Raman. I'm not in any debt so that's good it's not like I'm racking up credit card debt or anything like that. For those of you who have quit after having a decent sized habit, what made you stick with it? I think mine comes from boredom because there's nothing in life that makes me happy my job sucks and I'm all around just a cynical fucked up person but I don't want to keep up with this lifestyle. I have ppl that care about me and Want to see me succeed but I dont care about myself enough to stick to quitting. I did stop for about 2 months over the summer but I went thru some personal shit and jumped right back on the dope train. Anyone out there who has been in the same boat as me please help me out even with some kind words or something because I can't keep doin this to myself.

But Ive noticed after you finish the shot, DONT pull out immediately. Take your paper towel/shirt with isoproply on it and push down on the vein and needle, then pull out. 

Putting pressure on the vein before you pull out stops the blood from coming up and going through the skin. Then hold it tight for 30 seconds to a minute and, ta da, no noticeable mark. Or atleast way better than just pulling out then applying pressure.

I know you guys want to pull out and nod immediately, but just try it. Nod out with pressure applied even. 

The Isoproply dries it out along with all the safety measures it helps with. Then I hit it with aloe vera gell and vitamin E oil, sometimes Ill add a bandaid if Im feeling fancy.

When I first saw you I knew you were in serious trouble - you looked ill. We struggled to get IV access because you fucked your veins with years of IV drug abuse. We ended up having to put an IV in your neck. You were young but your body was old.


You had Hep C, and as a result your liver was totally fucked from it. You were bleeding from you gut. You were bleeding to death. We did the best we could but since you had Hep C and liver cirrhosis your ability to form clots was serioiusly impaired due to your cirrhosis. Despite our best efforts at stopping the bleeding you died and the only thing you were interested in was finding out if we could give you opiates for your withdrawal. I wouldn't wish your death on anyone.

I know it is hard to stop taking opiates but please remember that blood borne viruses like HIV and Hep C are 100% avoidable using safe practice. 

The odds are stacked against your survival already without needing to introduce another health risk like Hep C. If you beat your addiction you deserve a fresh start at life without HIV or Hep C.

Please use clean needles.

I didn't believer her. KEK. I was took monthly subboxxone injections for 6months, and stopped. I stayed clean for about 3 months and first big life letdown happens and I relapse. Fast forward 3months and I'm in the bedroom breaking the news to my girlfriend about how I just got suspended from my work for showing up fucked up (I had taken way too many benzos the night before trying to sleep while WD'ing). 

She was sympathetic and held me. . .


Then I told her that I had also relapsed for the past month (lie, I just told you it was 3). 


I have never seen somebody's body language change so quickly. She jumped up off of me and her normal warm relaxing smile had reverted to cold disdainful disgust. She basically told me that this was it and I had to leave, I spent the next few hours pitifully pleading with her until she went to bed. I couldn't sleep. I am devestated about my gf of 3 years breaking up with me, and feeling like a complete loser piece of shit. Two 1mg clonozopam and 2 caps of GABAPENTIN (fuck idk the 220 or 320's) later I'm still shivering, shaking, and bumping up like a fresh plucked goose. At this point I have lost it all. This is pretty rock bottom for me. No job, no girlfriend, I gave her all the cash I had because I owed for rent, just enough subboxxone to taper down for the next couple days. Plus, I stayed up watchhing 3Percent and smoking bowls of kind bud all night, for like the whole fucking season, and couldn't sleep a wink. Well I've lost it all, ***That's when i decided to bust out the DCK i had been sitting on forever and was rightfully wary of...*** I did reckless amounts, I was ready for the hole of oblivion. It came and it came fast. I wasn't sure if I was sleeping or dreaming, but it was awesome. I think I was like awake and dreaming, I was definitely induced lucid dreaming which was exactly the escape I needed from the hell I had created for myself. In all reality I probably did like .05g of the DCK. Then I woke up fine. . . seriously, I think this stuff is very efficactious for treating withdrawal symptoms. Staying with my brother tonight. I hope she forgives me. The pain of losing one you love is so much worse than the pain of withdrawal. I wish I had told her before it was too late and I had already lost my job.  . .

TLDR: GF broke up with me after I came clean about my heroin addiction, stayed up all night withdrawing and discovered DCK is a very effective tool for dealing with the general unpleasantness of withdrawal, well, at least combined with fucking GABA and benzos. . .",1480456891.0

Should I go to a walk in clinic? If it's a sterile abscess can they even do anything? Or should I just use a hot compress on the area every day and hope my body breaks down the lump over time?

I am not a regular IV user, I don't have any track marks, and I'm actually pretty muscular so I don't really fit the typical IV user profile so I think I could avoid embarrassment by not admitting to IV use, just say like I think I got an infected bug bite or something. 

Either way, this lump does cause me some anxiety. I've missed most shots I've ever taken, this fucking seals the deal. I wasn't meant to use needles.

So I unfortunately made a full-time job out of being a pincushion for myself over the past 4 or 5 months or so, and since then, duh... tolerance is getting stupid high.  A $20 sack of excellent quality dope from my favorite plug will rock my world all in one go, no doubt, but I go through about a g a day now, give or take, and it's insanely expensive.  I am resourceful enough to come up with the money to support this stupid, ridiculous habit, but it isn't fun or easy.

I had my main plug, but he went off the map a month ago, so I started fanning out and calling up my old contacts and a new one I had recently acquired.  One dealer I had rarely gone through always had good quality, I'd remembered, so I started hitting him up.  He was getting a feel for me, I was getting a feel for him, and we both realized we were dealing with people we actually wanted to be doing business with.  

Fast forward to this past 5 or 6 days.  He throws me fronts like no tomorrow, sometimes free testers, and he's just all around great.  I owed him $100 yesterday.  Came to him with $70, promising to get him back the other $30 ASAP.  He took my 70 and handed me a half g front, said something about ""don't want you getting sick, just get me back whenever, you're cool, I'm cool - we can keep it rolling like this for a while.""  On one hand it's awesome because I always get handed a fat sack when I'm just making a trip to pay him back, but on the other hand, it kinda sucks because his dope isn't quite what my dgirl's is (SOOOOOOO GOOOOOOD), so I always score from her in the same day.  This dude just has me running on a rolling tab, though, so even though it isn't great, it's hard to say no to fronted dope, and it's not bunk by any stretch of the imagination.  For instance, the other night I was worried about running out by morning.  He texted me and said he threw a 50 sack in the mailbox at a place we meet at sometimes and just added it to the tab.  Every time I try to pay him interest because it's taken a day or two to get back to him, he absolutely refuses to take extra.  What have I stumbled into?  Junkie heaven or hell?  I hate having the running tab on my back, but on the other hand, I feel like I never have to go sick, ever - he's so laid back about it and doesn't give a shit when (or how much at a time) I pay back, and he WON'T take tax!
