I still don't feel great but a hell of a lot better. Need advice on what to do, trying to get clean without detox or rehab (no insurance right now and already have been to rehab like 6 times) but it hasn't been easy.

&#x200B;

So I have a shitty dope habit (I do anywhere from .6-a gram a day, a gram being \~$100, IVing usually but sometimes I snort it if I need it to last longer) and I'm trying to stop. My boyfriend is on methadone but I really, really hate the idea of having to get up and go the methadone clinic every morning (I call it liquid handcuffs), almost as much as I hate tracking down the dope man every day. It's actually a hell of a lot easier for me to get ahold of my dopeman as he will deliver to me at this point, pretty much whenever. I feel great on methadone but the thought of being chained to a clinic forever, or trying to ween off methadone later in life, doesn't feel better to me than continuing to use. I have a love for travel, especially international travel, and being on methadone would more or less prevent me from doing this. It feels so limiting. At least if I continue to use I can still get high. 

&#x200B;

Anyway I tried being on methadone for 5 days and got up to 60mg when I decided this wasn't for me. My boyfriend was disappointed but it's my life. I figured I would just go back to subs, even though I was having a hard time making the switch to subs before this. I used to be on suboxone earlier this year, and had no issue with it for \~7 months. I was even totally clean on them for 5 months. Hanging out with people who were using is what got me to go back to using heroin. I also felt like the suboxone was starting to make me feel depressed, but anything and everything could have been causing that. 

&#x200B;

I used methadone, climbing from 40 to 60mg by increasing 5mg every day, over a period of 5 days. My last dose (60mg) was on Sunday at 9:45am. I did dope/fentanyl a couple times, about .6 on Monday and Tuesday, nothing Wednesday. To my surprise I felt really no withdrawal at all on Wednesday and was even out and about running errands. I had planned to take Subutex whenever withdrawal really started to hit. Finally on Thursday (earlier today), when it had been 90+ hours since I had taken any methadone and about 36 hours since I had done any short-acting opiates, I started to feel kind of blah and not great so I figured I could take the Subutex. I took 8mg sublingually. The only reason I did not wait until I was feeling more withdrawal symptoms is because I had not gone that long without anything or without feeling bad in a long time. I thought I may have accidentally detoxed myself. Stupid, I know.

&#x200B;

The PWDs were horrible... cold icy feeling in my veins, sweating like crazy, hot to cold flashes, goosebumps, couldn't sit still, felt like I was going out of my mind, crazy anxiety, irritability, depersonalization.... honestly it was horrible and at first as it was coming on I thought maybe it was all in my head until it got really bad. Somehow I was able to pass out and sleep for a bit and when I woke up my boyfriend was back from running errands (he knew what was going on) with .6 for me to shoot and that helped me feel better. I still don't feel 100% and I'm certainly not high.

&#x200B;

Was taking 8mg all at once my mistake? I had always been given this much at rehabs I've been at to medically detox from dope. Would waiting longer have helped me? I feel like I don't do that much dope that I should have to be in crazy withdrawal to take a sub. I never even get \*that\* physically dopesick.. Is it the methadone and (possibly) shitty metabolism that got me into this situation? I'm wondering if my body just wasn't rid of the methadone, which seems weird at 96+ hours when I had only taken it for 5 days.

&#x200B;

I never want to feel that again. We're going on a mini vacation (driving) for a couple days to Universal Studios this weekend. My plan is to do a little dope every 6 hours or so until we get back and then potentially try again with the subs or, begrudgingly go back to methadone. I REALLY DON'T want to do methadone but I am super scared of taking a sub ever again. I never want to experience PWD again, that was hell. Even though I never had a problem with subutex or suboxone in the past. Specifically I never had a problem with induction. I honestly don't know what to do and need advice. I want to get clean and be a normal person again.",1539315003.0

Well, this girl I ran around with a lot over the past year (she's always broke, sick, and asking for some when middling - but nonetheless a very chill, nice, reliable person) But now all of a sudden she is selling and has been keeping Opana stocked up 24/7. 

I called her today, and she needed a ride to go reup and was going to give me her price to take her. So obviously I did, and fast forward when she gets her shit she already has my 2, G74 Opana separated from hers.

Well, I've been noticing that these pills just aren't breaking down like they should be. Seems to be a lot less powder. We're pulled off in this empty parking lot shaving our Opanas down and once again my line looks much smaller than hers. 


I've never been overly concerned about getting fake Opana because they have an Orange coating and white interior powder so unlike the blue 30s which are uniformly blue throughout and much easier to press - I assume these would be much harder to ""Press"" given their 2 colors. 


But [This post has some really good, 2 color fakes](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ldwcr/strong_pressed_roxi_i_normally_do_80mg_and_half/?st=jn5cydpo&sh=df7270c4) has me concerned.

I have used vicodin and oxycodone in the past with no ill effects. I am strong willed and do not have an addictive personality. Please save the lecture. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I have come in to possession of a pill labeled “ABG 30” which translates to “Morphine Sulfate Extended Release 30mg”. I have two questions regarding this pill; typically I am good at finding these things online but I have been unable to find answers to these questions. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The first is can I turn these into instant release pills by scraping off the outside layer? Years and years ago I had some 40mg oxycodone extended release pills that were almost identical. I read online that the “extended release” part was located on the orange outside layer of the pills which I was easily able to scrape off with a razor blade. After that I cut the pill into 4 equal size pieces and they worked great. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The second question is regarding dosage. If I remember correctly with vicodin 15mg was my happy place and it was 10mg with oxycodone. For someone with no opiate tolerance what is a good, standard, starting dose? I plan on taking them orally but I am open to internasal consumption if necessary; I refuse to take them any other way (especially IV). Thanks!  ",1539306581.0

I've used drugs intravenously for around 4 years, opiates (pills/fent patch, never heroin, not common where I live) and meth.

I'm generally pretty clean with using... use clean needles each time, use alco wipes and keep my spoone spickk n span. (lol) I see other people who are sometimes downright filthy but they don't seem to have problem idk maybe my immune system is just weaksauce. whatever PLEASE be super duper careful and don't end up like me.

3 times in the past 2 years I've had to be admitted to hospital, once was a serious abscess where my arm grew three times the size (I've had abscesses before and drained them myself, tried to drain this one and it smelled weird so I went to hospital and was on IV antibiotics for a week)

&#x200B;

early this year I ended up with a massive infection in my chest cavity, (not in my lungs but the space inside my chest where the lungs inflate). Started off with a mild twinge of pain in my back, just beneath my left shoulder blade. Ended up being rushed to the city hospital (I live in a small town with a small hospital) in major agony, they ended up jamming tubes between my ribs connected to a chest drain... then surgery after a few days.. more chest drains after that, all up about 2-3 weeks in hospital on IV antibiotics.

They drained almost THREE LITRES of liquid out of my chest cavity. basically PUS.  gross. no idea how long that crap was building up inside me. And I had no clue.

&#x200B;

Recently I started feeling shittier than usual. I was pretty much bedridden for 2 weeks or so feeling really shit but not really able to pinpoint any reason why... didn't want to eat, or smoke, wanted to drink and drink and drink unquenchable thirst, sweaty, couldn't get out of bed even just going to the toilet was a mission. Started getting a cough

eventually gave up being stubborn and very reluctantly took my dumb ass to hospital.  After poking around a bit, they rushed me to the city hospital again, on a plane this time (city is approx 1 1/2 hrs away by road, too slow they said)

turn out i have an infection in my heart valve this time. Plus patches of infection all through my lungs.  spent a month in hospital (was sposed to be 2-4 weeks longer but I got kicked out for drug use, long story)

So yeah apparently one of my heart valves is now fucked, which causes my resting heart beat to sit at 115bpm. (used to be around 65). Infection had attached itself to the valve and has damaged it.  I used to use a heart rate monitor while exercising and with max effort hardcore cardio workout I'd get up to 160bpm.  Walking to the bathroom and back (20-30metres)  now I'm at 140. 

apparently they can replace the damaged valve with a prosthetic one. But obviously they aren't gonna do that while I'm still a drug user. Trying to get onto the suboxone program but they make all kinds of hoops to jump thru first.

I begrudgingly made the appointment. At the time I was in poor physical health, a bit strung out, and my eyes were red and puffy and hurt from wearing months old contacts and falling asleep in them every once in a while. I was a bit high on H when I showed up. 

My doctor was a dick and rushed through the exam. The pressure check was painful because of my dry puffy eyes and took a few tries to get right. 

At the end I was surprised to hear that my vision had apparently deteriorated in the last 18 months or so and I needed a new stronger script. A surprise because I’ve worn the same prescription for 15 years. 

Here’s the thing: I know being high on Opioids can sometimes cause double-vision, strabismus, lack of depth perception. Is it possible that my dependency or high affected the results of my eye exam?

Well, the point is i have a script for codeine, so i got the codeine legally, but pregabalin was bought without one (used to have it prescribed but the script expired so i just made up a story to the pharmacists and she gave me some) Will the codeine/pregabalin show up in my urine/blood tomorrow? Do they even search for it during the urine analysis? My countries health inspection and care isn't really that advanced as the one they have in the States, but i'm still afraid they might find it and ban me from the military.

I'm trying to avoid saying i have a script for anything, so i thought i should tell them i've taken some OTC codeine pills, but the problem is that i've taken a much, much bigger amount than i am prescribed via CWE (don't want to fuck up my liver with a constant influx of APAP) . Would it work if i told them i took a few OTC Codeine/paracetamol pills? How long does codeine stay in the system anyways? Or does the military usually search for the metabolites you get by injecting morphine/heroin?

What do I mean? Every time anyone posts about their Heroin use in this sub, some self-righteous soul comes along and starts to rattle off their list of anecdotes, telling them how bad Heroin is, like somehow they think that Heroin users may think Heroin is completely fine? SOME people DO use Heroin recreationally. Just because a lot of people can't, doesn't mean that nobody can. Aside from that, if every time someone mentions Heroin, a list of moralisers come along and cry about it, people aren't going to feel welcome to post about it any more. Every single time someone posts something about their Heroin use, someone's all like ""This is what I was like hur dur dur"" or ""All addicts started like this hur dur dur"". This type of attitude is not going to get you anywhere. Nobody who uses Heroin, whether and addict or a casual, gives a FUCK about what you have to say. Sorry if that seems rude, but people are going to stop posting about Heroin because of these arrogant douchy attitudes. I can see people may be trying to help, but when every single pro-Heroin comment is downvoted to oblivion, and the same generic anti-Heroin comments get a sea of upvotes, it really does just seem like Karma whoring. 

Acting in this way is also dangerous. People simply won't ask for help to do with Heroin. You're turning this place into somewhere people feel they can't discuss the topic. So people are going to stop. And when people do, that's damaging the cause of Harm reduction. That's not okay at all. 

I'm not trying to preach, but Yes I am a casual user. I use bi-weekly on Mondays and Fridays and then I do that for 3 months at a time, go cold for 2 months after. It's something I've just sort of trained myself to do. And for saying that, I got a swarm of people crying about it and downvoting me. It's just not okay anymore. Being so self-righteous that you're stopping people coming forward to ask for help or anything, because the atmosphere surrounding Heroin is so hostile, even in this OPIATE FUCKING SUB!!!

my boyfriend was addicted to opiates for 5 years (mainly methadone); i started dating him last october and officially in january. he told me about his addiction in december. i’ve been with him through every step of the process and he finally came clean with his parents in july and went to a detox center for 15 days. since then he has been clean of opiates and i’ve been so proud of him because of it. it’s something we’ve dreamed of — especially him — for so long. 

i found that he was being really distant with me and i figured it was because he is still going through the withdrawal process. even though he has kicked all of his physical withdrawals, i know the process lasts way longer than that for someone who has been addicted for as long as he has been. 

he’d be sitting next to me in bed and messaging someone on snapchat but trying to shield his phone away from me while doing that. i thought this was weird. it went on for a few days so finally i did the worst thing i could do, something i’ve never done and i never thought i would. i went through his phone while he was asleep.

sure enough he was messaging some girl on snap. calling her babe and all that, sending her songs, saying things like “be safe at the bars tonight luv” & responding to her pic at the bar with “i’ll take the blonde babe in the middle” (this especially hurt because he sent this to her while we were at my birthday party, lol). she asked if he had a gf and he said something about how we were probably going to break soon. (this is because i almost broke up with him a few days earlier over a fight we got into because i told him i was depressed and unhappy and he basically made fun of me for it so i got mad, and it led to an argument) he told her “i miss you” and she asked if he was in *our city* bc she lives in the next town over, and he said “i’ll be in *our city* for the next few days, come over some night and we can watch movies and mess each other’s hair up” lol


i was completely shattered and heartbroken. i always trusted him with my life and believed he’d never cheat on me because he was so mature and told me he didn’t understand how other guys were pigs because he already slept with a lot of girls in high school and got over that phase.

i woke him up (stupid of me because of course he was irritable then) and we got into an argument about it for like, 2 hours and naturally i wanted to break up with him but i didn’t. he said he’d change the way he has been acting (unaffectionate and distant with me). 

this was around 3 weeks ago, and last week he apologized again to me. but i’m still so heartbroken about it. i miss how sweet and crazy he used to be about me a few months ago, but every time i think that i remind myself that he was like that when he was on opiates. and that maybe now he’s acting this way because of withdrawals. i don’t know when i’ll finally meet the real version of my boyfriend but i’m willing to wait and see him. he told me yesterday he’s trying to figure who he is, too.

i don’t need advice, i want to stay with him and support him, it’s just so hard. i’m so sad and devastated over this, my self-esteem has really taken a plunge. i fucking hate addiction, i fucking hate opiates. ",1539231736.0

My habit was really bad about 2 years ago for a year straight, dumping all my money into this addiction with my gf at the time.

Within the past year I’ve been relatively good. Taking couple month breaks, saving money ect.

Just recently my boy told me about this girl and when I say she is MODEL material, I’ll never probably in my life be able to fuck a girl like this. Long story short, she fucks ppl to support her habit which is a serious fent tolerance habit. I’m 24, I never thought I would be paying for a girl to fuck, it’s not like I’m ugly just she’s way outta my league and i just moved into my own place. After talking to her she’s so nice and I just recently bought some Roxies to enjoy...spoke to her about getting High together bc no one knows i really do this and I don’t get high with anyone anymore since my last girlfriend, so it just sounds like a good time to enjoy with someone. 

I mentioned the roxy and she wasn’t even interested given the fact she said she wouldn’t even feel it.

IDK what to fucking do. The man side of me is saying fuck the hot girl and have a good time getting high together.

The other side is saying don’t be a moral scumbag and support a woman junkies habit who’s only fucking you bc you’re paying.

I'm not using a crazy amount(probably 0.25-0.35 bth a day smoking). So what I'm trying to do is sober up over the weekend. Unfortunately, I have no access to suboxone, the only thing I can get my hands on is methadone 10 mg pills. So any advice on the best way to get through withdrawals? I know I'm not going to be able to do this as painless as I did with subs but I want to get your advice. I know methadone withdrawals are crazy and I don't want to go that route, plus my dealer is charging a lot for these pills($10 but I don't know street value of methadone as I've never tried). 

Any idea on the best way to use these 10mg pills to get off dope? I'm trying to get over this fast and I don't want to be using methadone every day. What do you guys think about something like this:
day 1: nothing
day 2: 10 mg methadone
day 3: nothing
day 4: 10 mg methadone

Or something similiar? I know I'm definitely going to go through some(a lot) of physical discomfort, but do you guys have any recommendations on how to use methadone to at least ease my discomfort a bit so I can get some sleep and somewhat function?  ",1539217652.0

I'd like some advice from the other long-term injectors here. I'm currently getting to a stage where it's increasingly difficult to hit a vein, though I'm still managing. My remaining veins are very shallow and close to the surface and here in the UK they only do one size of needle at the exchanges which makes them very hard to hit since like 85% of the needle has to be out the skin and the tiniest movement knocks it out of place. 

I have done my hands, wrists, obviously my crook, forearms, both sides of my arms, found a few veins around my shoulders and have also done my feet & ankles. I have **never** been able to hit a vein in my legs at all. I haven't tried excessively, but I've given it a go many times and can never get blood except for the tiny tiny tiny veins on my knee and they are too small to hit. Since I've heard many people hit their legs, could anyone tell me where I might be going wrong? I know it's not the safest place to hit but I'm pretty certain it's safer than my femoral which is where I'm considering. 

I figure soon I'll have to start using my femoral, thus the questions. Preferably I will find some new veins before that - just a few months ago I realised I could turn the needle the ""wrong"" way so its pointed away from the heart and that allowed me to hit a bunch of veins on the far side of my arm that were at too awkward an angle when trying to hit them with the needle going in the correct direction, and that discovery gave me a few months of being able to hit my arms easily again, but those are in their death throes now. So, for the IV users:

1. How long have you been injecting, and at the moment where are you hitting?

2. For those of you who've had to resort to the femoral, how long was it until your other veins were fucked enough to make you do it?

3. How long has your femoral held out? I've heard some people say that it's so big & thick that you will always be able to hit it and get a flush of blood and it never becomes unhittable like the others, but I'm dubious.

I can totally delete this after someone answers if it is intrusive on the sub, but I looked in the search bar and didn't find anything really useful or pertaining to my situation.

I shot 30units of powder heroin into the vein below my thumb on my wrist. It was my biggest vein aside from my elbow, which I already shot and missed in. 

1. Is it normal for the site of injection to be really sore even 6 hours post shot? It throbs painfully when I walk with my hands by my side. My missed elbow shot doesn't even hurt that bad. Theres no redness, swelling or anything like that. Just hurts lol.

2. Is it normal for my pointer and thumb to be slightly tingly and numb at certain times and spots? I'm worried I blew the vein or fucked something up. I registered and then reregistered right at the end of the shot and it didn't look like I missed. I didn't remove the tie after I registered (I know dumb but I was afraid of falling out of the vein) but it was only 30 units so I didn't think it was that bad. There's also no bump like in my elbow. I got the rush etc, so I'm not sure what my wrist is doing, but it hurts lol. Maybe it was the cut?

3. Is it safe to shoot in the same vein even after I missed in it less than 24 hours ago (elbow) or in the vein in my wrist even though its acting funky?

Thanks for any help guys! I really appreciate it. :)

As I'm walking with her she tells me that she had just scored for the guy and he had promised to help her out if she got a couple of bags for him. But obviously his intention was just to dump her straight away and luckily they came across me just as I was getting dropped off. What a fucking arse hole. 
   
So we get to the dealers and he invites us in and he's out his nut nodding off every couple of minutes he had just returned from a funeral in the morning .I ask him for a couple if bags (£20) and he starts making them the first ones a normal bag 0.25 but the second one he's constantly nodding and weighs out to much 0.37 but he decides to give me it anyway as he cant be fucked mucking about with it. I ask him if it's alright to do it in the kitchen and he agrees so I do the bigger one with the girl and give her half of it. I stay for a little bit and then leave and tell the girl I need to go up town and I'll catch her later.

   Go up the town a walk and go to the Chemist and get more tools (syringes,spoons,citric etc) for through the week.

Just took a piss test for a new job. Drank a gallon of water, took multi vitamin (for color and specific gravity), took creatine + citric acid (byproduct is creatinine) and pissed mid stream. 

I haven’t done any opiates other than bupe for the last 3 days. 

Any thoughts on my process or input? I’ve used this several times before but I was worried this time because I took an at home piss test yesterday morning (when it was originally scheduled, but I begged off and got it rescheduled because it spooked me after I failed in my car). 

Can 6am be tested for specifically in hair? Wondering about metabolization. I have a rx for Vicodin. Don’t both H and Vicodin both ultimately end up at the same metabolite?

Any way to check for creatinine levels and specific gravity at home?

I just find it to cause really bad headaches and constant sweating than i wakeup suffering basically at 5am drenched in sweat. Ive only been dosing in the morning from about 6am to 1pm one tiny bump every 2 hours. I remember a week ago i had ran out of oxy and took clonazepam 8 hours later and it covered the withdrawals actually and i fell asleep about 2 hours after it worked well I went on 2 days without it. I think this is just fentanyl not some other rc? but who knows i just think that because i seem to go into withdrawal every 2 hours and everytime i dose it i feel worse and worse. So would this even be safe to take clonazepam after my last dose at 1130? I really have no experience with this stuff and want to just throw it out im scared the half life of fentanyl will interact with the clonazepam. I want to take it at around 330pm or 4pm? right now its been one hour im maintained but have a horrible headache and getting burning feeling on my skin sometimes and im very cold but hot.

I used a fairly large dose of morphine last week on friday, so five days ago. I drank a lot of water throughout the week and also before giving urine. Now, every single online source I've found, from acedemic studies, to the official stance of the national institute of drug abuse (NIDA), to rehab sites, everything on google all say morphine is quickly eliminated from the urine in 2-3 days max, so please dont tell me to just google it. if you have a credible source like a study that says otherwise that would help. The doctor sent it off to the lab and if it comes back positive there he'll send me straight to a inpatient detox. im doing a benzo taper too so if they test it for specifically what benzos im fucked because ive been doing it with something else than prescribed. this sucks hard because I just about kicked the benzos and the doctor says once i did that in a few weeks he'd switch me from methadone to morphine maintenance which will eliminate the need on my part to do morphine. 

TLDR
in every study and paper by the NIDA and other sources it says morphine is eliminated from urine after a max of 2-3 days. I took 100-200 mg of morphine 5 days ago on friday and was tested today wednesday. he said it was positive for opiates and hes sending it off to the lab. will the lab deliver a negative or will it likely be under the cutoff limit (1ng/ml)?

This is a really thorough discussion of how it works. 

I had poor results with magnesium oxide pills at rehab, and even expensive pills i bought at home, possibly because the opiate constipation, especially methadone, messed my intestines up over the years. So, I read some alt health sites and made up magnesium oil, a roughly 7 to 1 mixture of epsom salt (aka magnesium sulfate, or you can buy magnesium chloride online) and hot water (ie fully saturated and cannot dissolve anymore), in a coffee mug, and then took a shower with a loofah or nylon scrubber, and then rub the magnesium oil all over, and then do it again. Or, if im busy, ill just use the scrubber on my arms at the sink and then rub it on my arms.

It's amazing. It really is, and cheap as fuck to get epsom salt, especially since used this way a single bag lasts forever.

Re magnesium oil rubs after a shower, It's also a nice, cheap way to do something for your, perhaps, too often not cared for junkie body that is relaxing AND probably helps you get higher! I know it made me feel more human in a few ways, and this past month has been surprisingly easy, highly recommended. ",1539162440.0

Any advice, tips or tricks to make this as painless as possible?  It's been a 2 month IV habit of about .3 to .6 a day (not every day but fairly close). I'm planning to have my last dose on Sunday at 430pm. I have about 6 bags to stretch / taper until then. 

Do the WDs come on like H does? (For me it was always around the 18 hr mark where I'd start feeling real shitty) Can I expect a similar time line?

I mean when you're churning out MILLIONS of fake oxys, or supplying dope to nearly the entire eastern seaboard, you can't tell me using a proper industrial mixer would be a price issue. 

&#x200B;

I mean if everyone in this game is being rational killing customers with hot spots is bad for business, even the lowest seller on the totem pole should realize a dead junkie doesn't buy junk. Even if they don't give a shit about their customers on a personal level, they are still losing money.

It just seems like such a small and stupid issue that the producers don't seem to care about addressing, and not only is it removing existing customers it is also bringing down the legislative heat on all levels of the business.

I'm a person with ADHD that has had to switch to a different medication recently (Dexedrine) from Vyvanse. I had 0 issues sleeping on Vyvanse and while I have 0 issues getting to sleep on Dexedrine I can't stay asleep to save my life. I woke up around 15 times last night.

Told my doc this and I've been given scripts for both Clonidine and Seroquel. Basically try one see if it works, if it doesn't do the other. 6 tablets max for Clonidine, (It's 0.1 micrograms per tablet I think) and Seroquel is 25mg up to a max of 50mg.

I just did some research and I'm not going to lie folks Clonidine scares the fucking shit out of me and Seroquel looks better the more I read about it. All the side effects I see of Seroquel (weight gain, drowsiness, vivid dreams) don't bother me at all. Especially weight gain as I just started gym and am trying to gain weight. While Seroquel is used as an antispychotic which does scare the shit out of me I've read that at doses of 25-50mg theres not enough for it to ever attach to the receptors to give you any sort of issue with antipsychotic treatment. I'm 100% looking just for a sleeping pill.

As for Clonidine it reduces blood pressure, I don't have high blood pressure (got tested 3 days ago 120/70). I'm not sure how much you need to take of it in order for it to have any sort of big effort on your blood pressure so maybe that dose is completely fine.

I'm just looking for opinions on those of you that have used one or the other in doses around what I've said (I know some people take like 700mg Seroquel which isnt of much use to me) and how it has effected you from a sleeping perspective. I've got the Clonidine right now but I'm thinking of going back to the pharmacy for Seroquel.

I used to take 30's and methadone together as well as any other opiates I could get my hands on and snorted many together and when combining a few mgs of RC benzos that I would order. I know it was stupid to do. I would wake up sick and call in to be late to work quite often because the wd's started getting pretty bad after over the past 2 years of it all and I would go through a gram of 92% T.H.C terp oil every 2 days to fight the sickness when I didn't have anything. Mixing up flualprazolam, clonazolam and diclazepam propylene glycol solutions and making it super strong would have me blacking out and nodding out pretty hard after adding in the opiates. The shit show was, well shitty. I crashed my truck, stole from people even though I had plenty of money and just made an ass out of myself. Do I miss it, yeah sometimes but getting to the point of suicidal ideation because of how bad I felt about myself was my bottom. 

     I give kudos to those of you who can use or take your prescribed meds somewhat responsibly. I used to get prescribed 120 hydro 5's each month and they would be gone in 10-14 days on top of taking oxy 30's, perc 10's sometimes and the methadone. I feel lucky to have survived it all because I probably should have been dead on several occasions. I know my liver thanks me now lol. Reading the posts on this sub remind me of the good bad and ugly but also remind me of why I stopped. Kratom has been a godsend and helps anytime I have a craving as well.

So when I tell you this provides relief, I'm not some doc telling you this from the sidelines. I have lived this routine too many times, and this is how I have managed to reduce 70-90% of withdrawals each time I have kicked the habit, making it bearable enough to get through by allowing me to eat and get some sleep in that dreaded first week. I dont know if all of the items are necessary or if it would be just as effective without some of them, but each time I've kicked (at least 20 times, sadly) this is the routine I've used. It is expensive- overall around $300-400 for everything- but I'll mention some alternatives to reduce the cost at the bottom. Let's get started with a list of the things you'll need...

 • Kratom (preferably an extract, specifically OPMS Gold Liquid Vials or The original UEI Kratom or tincture made from it are the three most effective I have come across for opiate relief)

 • Loperamide (Immodium)

 • Xanax 

 • Cannabis

 • Restless legs tablets 

 • Clonidine

 • Unisom

 • Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid

* Mucinex

 • Food that is easy on the stomach (yogurt, apple sauce, peabut butter, bread, fruit)

The day before you start your kick start taking the Ascorbic acid in high doses. If you're starting your kick in the morning I highly recommend getting up, taking a shit, and getting a really good meal in your belly before the sickness takes a hold of you, youre also going to take more ascorbic acid in high dose and a mucinex. Idk about y'all but when I kick mucus seems to drain from my throat into my belly making me sick, mucinex will help you cough that shit up instead. It's likely the first thing you'll be taking after that is some Xanax when the anxiety starts, so take some Xanax and smoke some pot. If you can't afford these or you are being drug tested or something I recommend as an alternative getting some CBD oil and Valerian root extract instead, they're less expensive but don't work as well. Once you start to really feel sick, take 3-4 loperamide and take some kratom. For the kratom you will need to have enough to get you through at least 5 days, I prefer enough for 7. Each bottle of OPMS will keep you from being really sick for around 6 hours. Once bedtime rolls around you're going to: take Xanax, clonidine, restless legs tablets, kratom, unisom (fuck it i take 3) smoke pot, and meditate. Whether you believe meditation helps or not, just do it. Sit in silence for 5-10 minutes and focus on only your breathing. It gives time for everything to kick in, and for you to calm yourself. Then hit the hay for the night. The next day do the exact same things except you'll be taking kratom when you wake as well. Days 3-4 can be especially rough, I recommend having 3 kratom doses on hand for those days if you can afford it. If this list is too expensive to reduce the cost you can buy plain leaf Kratom which will help, but being honest it doesnt work nearly as well as the OPMS vials or UEI. You can also take Valerian root extract instead of Xanax & Clonidine, but again, it's not as effective. On my life, if you follow this regiment you will be able to DRASTICALLY reduce the effects of opiate withdrawal. If you can only afford a few things from the list the most important things I would say are the kratom, the loperamide, and then either the cannabis or the Xanax depending upon personal preference. I truly hope this is able to help some people, because I know before I figured this routine out I simply could not get through withdrawals. Sending love through the ether to all the addicts out there still suffering, y'all are not alone. Don't let this shit kill you.",1539148006.0

South Florida Fentanyl Presses,"First and foremost I’m sorry I cannot provide any pictures. I would like everyone to know it wouldn’t matter either way because these are all next to impossible to tell, whoever has been pressing them has become an expert. Over the past 3 months or so I have received fake M’s, fake k9, and fake V’s. Coloring for the pills has been spot on, light blueish white for the ms and k9s and the regular electric blue for the Vs. 

In my experiences recently, the only way to tell these apart are 3 fold. 1.) how easy they break, real ones should be hard to break with the fingers and should break cleanly, not crumble into pieces. 2.) once you break them open color should be consistent, in the fakes you can see little white specks spread throughout the pills (these are tiny specks of fent) 3. the taste when you snort them, should have the normal oxy taste to them. The fakes don’t really have a taste and you can tell the drip is different. 

Surprisingly when I licked these pills, they had a normal bitter taste to them making it even harder to tell. I started to use caution when I snorted one normally and was very close to OD’ing. Now when I receive them I do no more then a quarter of a pill to start. After receiving the third set of incredibly faked presses, I’ve switched to perc 10’s and luckily have not yet had any issues. I haven’t physically tested these pills but I assume they are fentanyl or carfentinal. If you’re in the South Florida, just be very careful. I have received fakes from 3 different sources now. This is really sad to see because the only reason I was doing pills was to know what I was getting and to curb my risk of overdose. Be safe all! 

Edit: In case you were wondering, I’ve been a regular user of all of these same pills for a period of 12 years or so. This is why it is very scary to me that they are so hard to tell apart. Unless you are getting them directly from the pharmacy, please be cautious and ease into them. ",1539139458.0

When cutting a bigger one into 2 smaller pieces, some dust was left on the plate, almost nothing. Yet, when I touched this dust it got me high. Wasn't really a big high, but I clearly did felt something - just from touching it. It felt like the last high I had when I snorted a piece, just less intense. also it stopped way faster and it had no ""after-effects"", meaning I didn't really get that warm feeling.

&#x200B;

This confused me, but I wanted to take some more. Now after this ""small high"" went over (just lasted a few seconds/mins) I took one of the pices I got from cutting (snorted) and it had almost no effect whatsoever. Which confused me even more.

It was less than I took last time (but even then I didn't take much), but this whole touching-high-thing got me a bit scared to take too much.

Now after a while I feel a bit dizzy, but not high. Also I'm hearing sounds out of my belly.

Maybe the dust I touched was just some good stuff (or maybe it was fentanyl?) and the piece I snorted was just bad stuff? I don't know. I've no idea about this. I also put pressure on the piece to transform it into dust, rather than sniffing up the piece. (didn't do this last time) Weirdly compared to last time when I felt nothing, this time I did feel it hitting the wall of my nose.

I know the first couple days are the worst, but god damn ive gotten clean for weeks before and went right back. It feels like a hopeless fight. Like im putting myself through resonless misery trying to get clean.

I got 3.5 gs of gas station kratom left. I need that just to get somewhat well but im trying to save it for the worst of it. I hate this lifestyle, i really do. But idk if i can escape this cycle.",1539133129.0

Also Sorry in advance for the wall of text, like I said, I just need to vent. I’m at a place in my life where my current close circle doesn’t truly understand all of this, my parents are sympathetic but tired of what we’re all going thru (I don’t blame them) and I can’t bring myself to dump this on my husband or kids. Definitely not my kids.

I just got home from the viewing for the 3rd close friend in 2 years. (I know that might not be “a lot,” but it hurts like it is) He overdosed this past Thursday night and was unable to be revived. He’d been clean for several years. At each of the last 2 funerals, he said “what’s it going to take for everyone to realize they’re killing themselves and one day it’s gonna be them we’re all looking at in a coffin?” And my heart is just so broken that he was so strong and fought it for SO LONG but it got him too.

I think what hits me the hardest is that these people were real people before their downfall. Beautiful, young, vibrant humans with the world at their feet - having an amazing time just loving life and exploring their talents... and it’s never a story of “started hanging around the wrong crowd” or whatever... it’s always been this core group, and when new people came to join the craziness - they didn’t leave, there weren’t “outsiders,” there were just friends. The guys were always shuffling through whatever bands and the girls went to every show. Break ups and make ups and everything in between. We’d lose touch for a while, then someone would have a party, someone would have an extra ticket to a concert, someone would be off at college and get lonely when their roommate went home for the weekend - a phone call was made and it was like there wasn’t any time passed at all. Like just today walking back out of the viewing, it took my brother-in-law (who was my friend in this same group of friends before he became my brother, actually) and I longer to get out the door than it did to get in the room because we stopped to hug and laugh and cry with just about everyone the whole way to the door. And all the moms were there, and they all hugged each of us so tight, but looked at us like they just saw us yesterday. One mom asked when I was going to have another bonfire at her house so she could get her bowl ready that she made everyone put their keys in. Except we all have this sadness hanging over us now. Because instead of a concert or a bonfire, we’re getting together at each other’s funerals... and our hearts are broken. 

We’ve all grown and evolved, as humans do. Some of us have families, some are in relationships or married, some are single and traveling everywhere they possibly can, some have been to rehab and moved away from home to start a life because that’s what they had to do to stay healthy.  Some of us are home still, clean and healthy and starting again here. Some of us are pretending like it isn’t a problem. Some of us are in denial that ours could be the next funeral we’re all at. 

Looking at one of your best friends of 20+ years laying in a casket from an overdose never gets easier. It gets harder. Every. Single. Time. It’s harder. It’s a different face. It never looks like the friend you love. Because it’s not them, it’s not their soul, it’s not who they are. It can’t be. Every time it happens, I refuse to believe it. They were just doing so well! They were clean for so long! Weren’t they? Wasn’t he? He was fine!! It’s not true! 

But it is. And it’s so morbid and heartbreaking and terrifying that when we’re all eating pizza and having a few beers and laughing about the good times after the funeral.. we’re all secretly wondering... Who’s next?

It just sucks.

Please be safe. Please be healthy. Please don’t be the next funeral. Please. 

Please.",1539131906.0

I think the title will give off a sort of negative impression that I'm against drugs. But I'm an enthusiast on what ever gives you your phix as long as it's used responsibly. I'm more of an uppers type of guy. 

&#x200B;

**Dose**

But I got my hands on some hydrocodone 5mg/325mg acetaminophen.  

&#x200B;

**Experience**

I took 2 just to start me out and see how it goes. These were those good old Watson's. I don't remember the pill imprint, but they had little red dots skewed across the pil as well as watson on the front.  About an hour later, I felt kind of tired and a bit sick. I ended up becoming extremely sick to my stomach.  But I did feel good, like a low wave of pleasureable feelings to my well being. Now, I have to admit that I've been on dependent on stimulants for a while now and was going through a slight withdrawal at the time. So I think my withdrawal could have affected the effects of the Vicodin moderately.  

About 2 hours later, I took 2 more. Totaling up to 20mg hydrocodone/1.3g of acetaminophen. I was feeling extremely itchy on my shoulders and back so hopped in the shower and it felt like R Kelly's golden shower! (Joke). It was really a pleasurable experience that I would like to have again some other day. Later that night, the itching increased and so did feeling sick to my stomach. 

**Pros:**

* Euphoria
* A very pleasurable shower
* Got good sleep
* Relieved some of my personal problems

**Cons:**

* Nodding off
* Very Itchy
* Sick to my stomach (Didn't puke)
* Bad For My Productivity 
* Can't get an erection. 

**Conclusion**

I personally feel like this drug shouldn't be abused/taken for people who have a productive lifestyle. I'm not sure if 20mg of hydrocodone is a strong dose for a first timer. But, 10mg was enough to knock me on my ass for a good/bad experience and 20mg was enough to make me feel out of this world. Getting rid of that sickness feeling, would have possibly gave me an up vote for Vicodin. Please enjoy responsibly. ",1539099323.0

So 5 years ago on Halloween, I fell out having a massive overdose from heroin (spooky right?) that made me come to my senses. I went to rehab and moved to Florida when I got out to get away from the junkie scene in my home town. But, y’all know how it goes. Always having a little itch in my brain telling me to take a shot. Sooo occasionally, I get too excited over the situation and take a couple perk 5s or smoke some opium about once a year. That settles my cravings for a while and I stop thinking about using....

So I found this sub a couple months ago and it set me OFF. Seeing those shots people post up is better than porn. As my mouth was watering reading this sub, I decided I’d order 2 grams of opium from the web.... so I bought the btc, went to make my order, and what do you know, I’m a couple dollars short if that sweet second gram... now I have some cash sitting on my dnm waiting to be spent... not enough for opium, and I’d hate to buy some weed stuff when I can go to my medical shop and get it in person.... but I have the perfect amount of BTC to buy my favorite thing in the world.... Dillaudid 8 mg... do you guys think I should buy it, or hold off? I’m just worried that I’ll be sucked in again, otherwise my mouth is absolutely watering. ",1539089039.0

Harm minimisation.","In the interests of harm reduction, I thought it important to clear up some misconceptions that I’ve heard repeated lately regarding Naloxone. 

The vast majority of us know how and when to use it & what needs to happen immediately after. 

But for those of us who are new to opiates, or who aren’t quite sure what it can or can’t do, (or what to expect if we ever have to use it) here is an important run down that could very well save your (or someone else’s) life. 

It’s important to note that if you’re considering using Narcan (naloxone) either as an injection into a muscle, IV or intra-nasally then this is a SHTF or worst case scenario. 

You’ll likely save the person you are about to Narcan’s life, but you may throw them into Precipitated Withdrawals if they’re physically dependent

• Naloxone is an opioid receptor antagonist. That means that when it’s used, it displaces (or kicks your DoC, which is an agonist) off your opioid receptors. 

• If you are OD’ing, this will reverse the OD and the user will generally regain their respiratory drive (start breathing again). 

• Depending on what drug they’ve taken, their tolerance and how they took their dose (orally, IV etc) multiple doses of Naloxone may be needed until the patient regains consciousness. 

• Further doses of Narcan (naloxone) may be administered every few minutes until desired response (consciousness & normal breathing), is obtained. You won’t do any harm by giving them too much naloxone & it’s better to give too much than not enough. 

• It is CRITICAL to understand this next point. Naloxone does NOT “cure” an opioid OD. It’s not like getting bitten by a snake, the doctor gives you the anti-venom and you’re better. 

• Naloxone has a limited duration of action. 
Generally 30 minutes to 1 hour. If the drug you have taken, has a longer duration of action (highly likely) then when the naloxone wears off, the opioids will flock back onto your receptors (getting you high again) and you may very well go back into OD & stop breathing again. 

• This is why it is vital to view Naloxone as something to buy you time to get to hospital or for the paramedics to arrive. It will keep you alive long enough for an ambulance or to get to a hospital. 

• This is the reason that when you OD and get to hospital, best practice is to put you on a Naloxone IV drip (to stop you falling back under again) while we observe you. 

• The *only* way that opioids are eliminated from your body, is by your body metabolising them, breaking them down & you passing them from your system. All the Naloxone does, is temporarily stop opioids reattaching to your receptors. 

• If you REALLY have a beef with hospitals or doctors, and if you have a stash of enough Naloxone, yes it’s possible to dose someone every 30-60 minutes for 12 hours to make sure they don’t fall back into OD again. There’s no difference between your OTC naloxone and the stuff we put in the drip in the ER. 

• People who have been given naloxone will often be confused or combative and not aware that they had overdosed. If this is the case, ensure your own safety and wait for the paramedics to arrive. 

• Do NOT make the mistake of thinking that because the person (or yourself) insists that they feel fine, that they are out of danger. Naloxone simply kicks the opioids off your receptors for an hour or so. They are still there and waiting to reattach and cause you to OD again. Get medical help ASAP. 

• I apologise if this seems overly simplified or paternalistic. But naloxone does not “dissolve” or “cure” an OD. It is a tool to buy you time. 

If you do not have access to Narcan, then you can absolutely save a life. Opioids are not toxic in and of themselves.

 If you can keep the blood pumping and oxygenated by CPR until the professionals arrive, that’s good enough. 

If the person has vomited, place them on their side in the “recovery position” (please Google to see illustrations of the position) & try to clear their mouth of any vomit. 

As an anecdote I have personally seen someone who overdosed, was brought to the ER & placed on Naloxone. This person was angry, but lucid, coherent and totally “with it”. He ripped the IV line from his arm. Against medical advice, he self discharged. 

He thought he was fine. We spent some time treating him for other issues and then he waltzed out of the ER. He was found by police OD’d on the pavement a few hundred metres away. 

He was brought back & placed in a coma while the naloxone drip was restarted. 

His toxicology came back, he had consumed a tremendous amount of methadone (which has a duration of action of approx 24 hours). 

He collapsed because the narcan wore off after approx 30 minutes. 

DON’T let someone you’ve narcanned, refuse medical assistance. If you have to, call the ambulance and leave. You’ll still have saved a life.",1539086063.0

Cravings are present, but less intense and less frequent (instead of every 5 minutes we are at like every hour now). Rls was lighter during the day, always ramps up at night. Insomnia fading, but my sleep schedule is fucked so I'm almost nocturnal now. I made a to do list and actually look forward to completing the tasks. I feel like my fiery self. And I've been planning on a family activity this weekend.

The bad? Well, there isn't any right now. A little rls and restlessness but, come on, that's NOTHING compared to what we all go through. I have to remind myself that these little discomforts are NORMAL. normal people feel this shit. I'm almost normal. Lol I need to say it a few times because it's like unreal.

But before that I was on a good 2-3 month stretch. Only occasional bouts of coke. I never really planned it until few days prior. I knew I had time, money, and was currently dealing with a  breakup/other external issues. I just needed to fall out of society and go full blown addict. Crystal/H/Coke/Oxy in any order for the whole two weeks. Insane how quickly all the good things you had going can roll down hill if you just let them. 


Also anyone know that feeling of doing drugs with someone that it makes you feel dead inside ? They are such good people who you know have talent and potential and It’s not entertaining watching someone else ruin there life with you. Especially when your around their parents and friends and you have to act like you weren’t smoking meth and snorting dope and coke for the past week straight with them listening when they lie over and over to their faces


Just looking back after a wild binge like that it’s just a blip of my life that I was completely out of touch with anything else in the world besides drug use. Honestly today I had some regrets about it and rightfully so but also what’s the point of doing all that crazy shit and blowing the money if your not gonna enjoy it? I’m cleaned up now just on a rapid taper after the opiates. (which might be more like 18 days straight now) don’t plan on having another rip like that for awhile but as I said earlier I never really do..that’s the thing about it for me. 

I’m just happy that nobody got hurt or anything i didn’t have to steal or rob this time to make it happen. I spent my own money. But still, I can’t keep building myself up just to break myself down. 

Throwaway account..long time lurker.... just decided to post. Really enjoy the love over here guys, plan to be a more active member to this sub in the future.

But i find it absurd that 90% of rehabs are affiliated with 12 step programs and that they say AA is the only way to get sober. First off, i dont want to be ""sober"", i want to live my life without having the obsession of using opiates and benzos. I still plan on using marijuana. 

People in 12 step programs instantly declare you ""not ready"" and say you will relapse. AA is so outdated i cant believe this shit is the most talked about way to stop using drugs. Every single meeting is exactally the same. People sharing the same thing saying you must work the program and get a sponsor blah blah blah. They say straight lies saying if you honestly complete the 12 steps you will stay sober. I know plently of people who took it seriously that have relapsed. Back when i gave AA a try, my sponsor relapsed.

Im currently in a rehab and the whole program is hand outs from 12 step groups and going to meetings at night. I tell everyone i just dont agree with what they say and instantly everyone thinks im going to relapse and think i dont care about getting better or im just ""not ready."" I have been to 12 step rehabs 6 times and it didnt do me any good. Its like giving someone the same medicine 6 times after it keeps not working. 

I have also heard someone say ""I feel empathy for all of you who do not have a sponsor, because YOU WILL DIE! 

They also say it doesnt have to do with god but just look at the 12 steps, it says god like 7 times. And you even say the our father at the end of some meetings. I think ""turning you life over to a higher power"" is bullshit and that we as addicts need to actually make progressive changes about ourselfs and not ""give it to god."" 

And the whole chip thing. Thats not right to make someone who has lets say a year clean, and they relapse to fucking start over and make them feel like a failure. They still got a fucking year clean and can get back to where they were. Making someone annouce how many days they have, i think hurts more than helps. 

Im about to go to a meeting now and im dreading listening to these fucking idiots praise god and talk about how shitty there life is and how much fun it was when they were using. Its like all they remeber is the ""good ol times."" I could go on and on about how much i hate 12 step programs but what do you guys think? I want to know how others feel and if im the only one who sees through the AA nonsense.",1539049158.0

I want to be supportive but, every time I give her a chance she messes up right away. She says I’m too controlling with the money but, I’m the only one working and want the bills paid. I thought by letting her be in control of the money she would see that I trust her again. 

She gave me her last two pills and I flushed em. I think I overreacted. I don’t know if those are the last two. I don’t know what to do. I was so proud of what we were accomplishing together, now I feel so alone. She’s the only one that I go to when I’m sad. She’s the only one that makes me happy.

This shit is fucking insane..so her sugar daddy is a very old man who has dimenshia and is clinically ill.  He can't keep his finances straight and forgets what is going on with his close family.  On top of that his daughters and even their lawyer has contacted this lady about keeping her hands off his money and stop abusing his old man any further.  But she will not listen and honestly feels she is entitled to his money.  She even told me she hasn't physically seen him in over 2 months.  It's really painful to hear how excited this scummbag is to financially ruin this decent old man.  I read a letter from his family begging her to stop stealing his money, to the point where his grand daughters had to stop going to college because he couldn't afford to support their tuition.  She was bragging that his family switched his credit card numbers but she went through his wallet and wrote down the new numbers.

I just can't believe this toothless lady can sit here smoking $200 worth of crack, and $200 worth of heroin.  In a hotel she charges on his credit card, eats food he pays for.  Then spends all day ordering clothes and other items online with his credit cards.  It would make anyone with half a heart sick to their stomach.  What would you do?

I respond that I can handle cold turkey and rehab isn't an option in the sense that I would be missing work and I don't need anyone else finding out about me relapsing especially considering the negative effect felt from just him finding out. My wife is getting induced on Saturday and I'll have 3 days off work to spend at the hospital and I can use that time to wisely cold turkey it out there. I'm just so upset at the fact that he just wants to ditch on me and expect me to tell my mom and wife and expect them not to freak out on me as well. It's just disappointing that you feel you have a supportive friend and they turn out to just dip out on you and basically he didn't even want to finish the car ride with me.

Around 2011 my hip was popped out but i thought it was just back pain. I bought roxis and dope off the street and never really figured out what was wrong until i got 100 % sober. august 10th i start a methadone clinic for a year exactly, then august 10th of 2017 i went to rehab for methadone coke and benzoes. Rehab was under insurance the clinic was not. I have moved out of state and started seeing a different doctor. He gave me kpins for 3 months then cut me off because he saod i was addicted. Once i started school, i was walking because it was pretty much across the street. I could feel something was wrong but wasnt sure. Well my leg has been hurting for awhile so i went to the dr and they said nothing in the hip is broken, but it does pop out of place.

My question is, since im going to this dr under insurance will he be able to see the psych ward visits for detox and rehab visits even though they were in a different state? Also will he be able to see the methadone clinic even though it wasnt under insurance? I would like to get pain pills, but if hell only give me suboxone, id rather go to my gp because hell allow me to smoke weed and i had to sign a paper for the bone dr saying i wont use illicit drugs. Also the bone dr who im now going to had me sign a paper saying i wont lie if i was addicted and if i do, they have the right to not treat me. 

So im asking this before i spend all my money to see him and if he asks and i lie, then get kicked out and be right back at square one. Just trying to figure out what i should do about this. ",1539027251.0

Last week I quit cold Turkey and had 3 days clean because I had no money but when Thursday came around, my paycheck cleared and i got high immediately.

I'm in a financial situation where I need to save as much money as I possibly can but working without getting high has proven to be one of my biggest obstacles. I have about half a subutex now and my buddy gets a script for them so on Thursday when I get paid instead of blowing all my money on dope I want to strategize how o can get clean without dealing with the withdrawal.

This morning was about 12 hours since my last fix and I was sweating, had a runny nose, and the shits was looming around the corner. I was gonna try to tough it out at work but I'm a baby when it comes to working sick so I got high.

On Thursday my order of 250g of kratom comes in and I get my paycheck so I want to get one or two more subs and some 1mg kpins from my buddy and ride this shit out so I can get clean and save my money. I only have like $70 to my name until then.

Nobody knows I've relapsed and I need to keep it that way. I can tell the withdrawal isn't nearly as bad as it was but I want to be smart about it this time. 

I'm in the dark right now so reddit is my only support system when it comes to trying to get sober at the moment.

9melmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9melmq/codeine_overdose/,15,https://redd.it/9melmq,keiayamada,Codeine Overdose,"Yes you read it right.


Well so yeah it happened.. First of all, let it be known that I live in a far east Asian country, Japan, where drugs are the biggest social taboo and regulated very strictly, hell nobody here knows the difference between meth and marijuana, most people here even refer marijuana as to a type of ""meth-like stimulant"". A gram of marijuana has a street value of over $60, which is still rare as fuck, and you could never dream of finding a heroin dealer unless you live in the center of Tokyo, and you can get arrested and be expected do ten years in jail for possessing like 0.01g of cannabis. For these reasons, codeine and dihydrocodeine are pretty much the only readily available drug here that can be obtained easily. Those two substances are OTC in Japan. I can just walk into a nearby drugstore (not even a legitimate pharmacy) and grab a bottle of DHC pills that costs less than 10 dollars. The only bad thing I'm getting is a suspicious look from the staffs but eh do I really care. Second of all, I'm 18 years of age, 160cm (5'3"") tall and weigh 55kg (120lbs), completely naive to opaites so you know I'm lightweight. 

It hasn't been so long since I started abusing dihydrocodeine pills (mixed with ephedrine). My DOC only have been OTC shit like DXM and alcohol and failed attempts to try natural psychedelics. One $10 bottle of dihydrocodeine pills contain 84 sugar-coated pills and each pill contains 2.5mg of DHC. When I first started, I started with a very low amount, around 50mg. It felt like heaven and I felt like a feather and I have been doing this every day for an entire month. My tolerance and dosage only went up every single day. It happened last night, I swallowed 50 pills of DHC which equates into 125mg of DHC, my stomach was full so it took a couple hours to kick in. When the codeine kicked in, I decided that I wanted to redose since my tolerance is building up and I wanted to feel like the first time once again. So as the codeine starts kicking in, I swallowed all the remaining pills in the bottle. 34 pills. So I was getting high on 210mg of DHC in total. My high started peaking and it felt amazing. It felt like my first time on codeine and I wondered how there can be stronger substances like heroin and fentanyl when even the weakest of opiates can deliver me excessive euphoria. It felt good... until after three hours. It's been around 8 hours since I dosed, and I was peaking for three hours that's where I started noticing there's something wrong. The peak would usually only last less than an hour and codeine should wear off typically four hours after kicking in. It wasn't. So I decided to turn off my phone and try to sleep. I closed my eyes and I was still feeling euphoric and extremely sedated. I was very tired at that time so I didn't have any doubt I would fall asleep instantly. Well that didn't happen. My high ended up peaking for six hours, SIX FUCKING HOURS and I couldn't fall asleep at all despite having my eyes closed for four hours , it was a very uncomfortable experience. I got up to get ready for school, was feeling like shit but still tried to go regardless. I got on the train and I was feeling extremely nauseous but I assumed that I wasn't feeling well because of the lack of sleep. Well I ended up vomitting... I puked in my mouth and had to swallow it back I know how disgusting it sounds but I had no other solutions. Got off at the next stop and asked the station staffs for help. I eventually got to school but I was bedridden at the nurse's office and got sent home. 

I would have never expected to overdose on a weak substance like Dihydrocodeine. I still can't believe my high was peaking for six hours straight. It really is far beyond my ability to comprehend, that there are many people out there shooting heroin non-stop to feel good, when a simple overdose on codeine makes me feel like I'm dying. How do people even manage stronger substances? Well I'm sure I'm never touching codeine again at least this week. I needed some tolerance break, after all.

I am indeed aware of all the negative stigma around the substance codeine on this sub, but it's still my drug of choice. I don't care if you call me a featherweight cunt or whatever, go take your opiate elitism somewhere else if that's what you're intending to do. ",1539003338.0

&#x200B;

any ideas on whats going on with this? my guesses are either i am missing a little maybe the needle doesnt fit in the vein perfectly so a little squirts out the side or something, but ive had pain where there was almost no signs of vein and skin irritation afterwards suggesting i missed none of it. plus it seems the force of injecting would force the vein off if it were already poorly inserted. 

&#x200B;

perhaps these veins run alongside/intertwine with nerves and the movement of liquid through them puts pressure on the nerves or something?

&#x200B;

ps i know its definitely not an artery, ive hit those. when i hear people say they willingly inject into arteries i think they either never actually hit an artery or they are lying to look hardcore, that shit sucks i would never willingly do that. painful veins arent even close, i dont mind using them as long as im not actually fucking osme shit up.",1539000491.0

Tonight I OD’d at a dinner party in front of my GF, her biz partner and her parents. I feel like such an idiot and terribly ashamed that her family had to witness that.

I’ve been casually using over the last few months.  I got my hands on 10 M30s and I’ve been taking them a quarter at a time since August.  I take such a small dose because I’m small (5”5 / 120 lbs) and because I don’t want to develop a habit or a tolerance.

Well tonight, I learned my lesson that there is no such thing as a casual user.  I’d searched this sub to gauge what other people’s experience was snorting instead of swallowing m30 pills.  They all seemed positive so I decided to try it.  I crushed and snorted 5 mgs to see what would happen.

I remember feeling really high really quickly.  Way too high.  When I swallow the pills, I don’t feel anything for almost an hour but this onset happened within 5 minutes.  I was able to hold it together for 15 minutes before I passed out on the couch.

2 hours later, my GF tried to wake me up but I wasn’t responding.  Her biz partner told her to call 911 immediately and he had to administer CPR because my breathing and heart rate slowed so much.  I now have a bruise on my chest from where he was doing the compressions.

Then suddenly, I was awake with EMTs and the fire dept. loading me onto a gurney and taking me to the hospital.  I started crying because I was scared and I was ashamed.  No one knows that I’ve been taking these roxys.  I hid it so well because I would space them out weeks apart and take such a dose as to feel amazing but not nod off.

The cat’s out of the bag now.  My GF had to call my parents and explain to them what happened.  I’m going to dinner with her parents tomorrow and i have to explain to them how their daughter’s gf almost died in front of them.  It’s 5am and I can’t sleep because my chest is in a lot of pain and I’m terrified of taking a Xanax to fall back asleep. 

I learned today that there is no such thing as a casual user of opioids.  I should be dead right now.  Had I taken this on my own, there would’ve been no one to save me in time.  I gave the remaining 7 pills to my GF and told her to get rid of them.  I’m done for good.  

TL:DR - I thought I was being slick by being a secret casual user and almost died trying to snort 5mgs of roxicodone.  ",1538912826.0

I used to be mostly a psychedelic guy with a side of RC stim use at occasional parties. 4-HO-MET was my first drug ever besides alcohol, and I fell in love at the first trip, over two years ago at this point. After that, I would trip every three or four months on 4-HO-MET—such a beautiful, colorful world. I still do. My thoughts run a mile a minute, but it’s a really fun and occasionally insightful change of pace. I was also lucky enough to try real synthetic mescaline once—it’s an incredibly gentle yet powerful guiding psychedelic. Still have a couple grams stashed.
		
I got a gram of O-DSMT out of curiosity alongside my usual psychedelic purchases, and enjoyed it enough to dose about once per week. Ran out, went three months without it until I found a way to get it again, and bought a gram and a half. Still working my way through that stash; I’ve been chipping O-DSMT for about a year now since the original purchase.

I won’t lie—I love this stuff, and look forward to my dose when a day off from work rolls around (I don’t have a “fixed” work week due to the nature of my job). I get a good five hours of warm, cozy bliss every five to ten days, snuggling up in bed, listening to music, and watching some streams. To resist the temptation to escalate my dose amount/frequency, I log every dose, try to keep busy with work and hobbies to ward off thoughts of dosing out of boredom, and try to use only as a reward and not a coping mechanism. I take longer, two to three week breaks from my use now and then. 

But even though I try to do everything right...on a bad day, I’m always aware of that nagging feeling in the back of my head, that a nice dose of O-DSMT would dispel those emotions. It worries me. I’m well aware that it only takes one crippling setback in life to “break” a chipper...but fuck me, I have an opportunity to buy five more grams. Can’t bring myself to buy it, can’t bring myself to turn the offer down either. I know it’s weak stuff compared to H and the stronger pharma opiates, but damn.

TLDR: Naive dude thinks he can use opioids in moderation, kinda succeeds for a year but is caught off guard by just how powerful they are.",1538960263.0

Long post, questions marked as *question* below if you'd just like to skip the wall of text and background info. Thank you!","I apologise about the wall of text I just wanted to be as specific and thorough as I could be so theres minimal confusion by vagueness.

So one of my best friends and I have found a Methadone Maintenance Clinic kinda close to us that take cash and is affordable, $17 per day for your Methadone Dosage and counselling which is totally affordable (in comparison to a daily dope habit) and almost unheard of from quite literally any other clinic in my area. The fee never changes unless you switch to Bupe or Subs, we've got a mutual friend who's been attending for what I would consider a long time, more than 8 years and is completely reliant on the MDone now, just like any dope habit however clearly cheaper and safer. And he is also up too 180mg(mL)? per day.
So, I've been researching MDone Maintenance as thoroughly as possible and I've still got some questions I hope anyone here can  help me understand a little better..

*(1)I want this to be temporary, and as temporary as possible not long term, is this possible Thoughts? I know this isn't ideal but the last thing I want is to be hook on another drug and from what I've read methadone WDs are some of the worst because of how long acting this drug specifically is.*

I would ideally like to start on the highest dose I need to at least have minimal discomfort, maybe even none but I don't wanna push it. Then I'd like to continually drop my dose everyday there after for two weeks at most, less is possible?

*How feasible is this or is this just not possible?*

The clinic and its employees are really cool and pretty down to earth people, includin the main Dr like honestly some of the coolest people I've ever personally dealt with in years. I was told, by main doctor, I can go one day(today) and never come back or we can come back for life as long as we're alive. They're willing to work with you on dosages but I'm just not thinking to the degree I'm wanting or hoping for like consistently dropping dosages especially so early on?

*(2) How long(as in once a day doses) can I expect to use this without just getting another habit on a different drug? The induction was 30mg(ml)? Of liquid MDone thats all they'll do, as long as your comfortable which Im ok my biggest thing is I'm at least not dying like normal H withdrawal, however they will up your dose on day two if need or you can stay at your current dose but they didn't say anything about lowering my dosage? I'd like to ask them if I can slowly lower the dosage day after day even if I have to lie and say that it's too much and I could do with less even though I know I could use more I just wanna use this to get this monkey off my back and been done with everything with a slow but steady daily reduction until it's as low as they'll allow me to go then just jump off if possible.*
*Is this a viable option to any of you, what are you thoughts?*

I apologise for the book, I've researched as thoroughly as I could and these were the last of my concerns that I couldn't find readily available online or I found conflicting answers which is bound to happen I'd just like opinions from real users and not some article . I apologise for any errors and the length, I'm on mobile and I'm honestly super excited to get this over with and move on with my life fibally. This my first real attempt at quitting and staying clean and I know relapse happens but I really am going to give it my all to move forward with sobriety, from all drugs actually, and start to improve my life and leave this shit in the past. I know it won't be easy, it's really fucking hard or I wouldn't be here asking these questions at another clinic trying another drug to get off this shit once and for all, for the fourth time in 2 years honestly. Suboxone just wasn't for me, straight bupe tablets by it's self may have worked but the sub clinics in my area won't let you use straight bupe longer than the induction and first week or so. Then suboxone is mandatory, obviously to deter potential drug abuse, which is totally understandable but that drug combo in particular just didn't sit well with me mentally or physically. The negative side effects both mentally and physically just made me uncomfortable in my own skin and in my own mind honesty. So bupe then subs are the first and generally the only drugs they offer around here that's why the MDone clinic is so huge for me, for whatever reason the vast majority of clinics won't even talk about methadone, it's like buprenorphine/nalaxone are the only viable options to them when if what I read was correct, methadone also has opiate/opioid blocking effects just not to the extent of bupe/subs?

Anyway tanks so much all. Any responses or opinions really are very much appreciated. I will listen to absolutely anything anyone has to input on my questions and first hand experience would be fantastic but not necessary as I know it took me personally two years to even find a methadone maintenance program anywhere near me that was also flexible and affordable.

I relapsed today after 6 months of suboxone maintenance. I've been feeling very down during my favorite month of the year. Halloween the leaves changing pumpkins and all things that used to make me the happiest didn't help. Finally after like 5 or 6 years found a girl that I real feelings for that i think is mutual. Since I've moved to the Midwest I work constantly and have very few friends to spend time with when i have free time. It's funny though when I was back home on Long Island I had a band, many groups of friends, and an awesome caring family. But all I wanted was to be left alone. I got what i wanted and now I want nothing more then to have companionship. Funny how those things happen.

Anyways because of that after meeting this gorgeous young girl, she brought back many amazing feelings I forgot that I even had. Yet those good feeling came along with the other terrible feeling I used to have. Like paranoia, jealousy and wearing my heart on my sleeve so my heart can just shatter at
Any moment. If this happens i know it's irrational and i may be a gigantic pussy but I'm done with it all I'm never putting myself out there again. Since i have not friends and family here I've grown very attached to this girl. I finally got the weekend off which I never get and we were suppose to have a really nice night to eat popcorn and watch scary movies something that really would've meant so much to me since I haven't gotten to
Do that with someone in a really long time. Which turned into I'm tired maybe I'll Just come over and talk to Im not comming over at all. She couldn't even just talk on the phone for like a little
Bit. I know it sounds small and stupid but it really would've meant so much to me. 

So all that combined with just being alone with my thoughts and a wallet of
Cash triggered something in my mind to make the hour drive to my plug that never told me his name bought a gram and threw away 6 months that i worked really hard to get.

Well now I have to tell my counselor at the clinic I relapsed and face the consequences of my failure. I almost stopped myself too. Sorry for the long shitty post but I needed to vent and you guys are the only people who get it. Thank you

They come in those [typical blister packs](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Cold_Form_Foil_blister_pack2.jpg/220px-Cold_Form_Foil_blister_pack2.jpg). I went to pop the first pill out...and it was just empty, absolutely nothing inside. I tried 3 more pill slots and they too were empty. I shook the strip against my ear to listen for a rattling sound, but didn't hear it. I checked the other box and that was fine and normal. I was baffled and perplexed. I left the last few slots unopened in case I had to prove it.

So I called up Boots to speak to the pharmacist that oversees my script. I explained to him the problem and he asked me to come in. When I got there, and he told me he had checked the rest of their stock of Buprenorphine, and half of the strips had the same problem. He said there must of been a massive manufacturing error and he would have to alert Boots HQ and the manufacturer immediately. He had a look at the half-opened strip I brought in, apologized and gave me the 7 pills that were missing.

In a way, I'm thankful half their stock had the same problem or he might not of believed me.

Sorry, might be kinda a pointless, maybe irrelevant post but I just thought it was funny and really weird",1538947315.0

I get all the common symptoms like the shakes, cold sweating, runny nose, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and especially insomnia. But one thing I always suffered from that I've never heard/read anybody ever experience is something I call the tingles. It's an extremely unpleasant tingling sensation that centralizes in my lower neck. It used to be closer to my back in days past, but for the past few years it's always my neck. Along the spine regardless. Imagine that feeling of nails on a chalkboard times ten. That's what it feels like. Like all the nerves in that area are screaming for help. The only way to make it go away is to move your body. Its usually only present if you're holding still. Makes if impossible to hold still, which also means it makes it impossible to sleep. It's not painful. It just makes you feel like you wanna run away and rip your skin off. Has anybody else experienced this or something similar? Recently I've been taking high doses of tianeptine sodium and getting hooked on that for a few days, then I'll take a break. Addiction comes fast which means withdrawal is pretty much guaranteed after just a couple days of usage. The withdrawal is pretty much the same as opiates, but the tingles and insomnia are the absolute worst. There's no rest until it's over. Or if you have kratom. Kratom makes it all go away like magic.

It was a normal day, except this time I fancied some Heroin. I don't consider myself an addict at all. I call up my plug, who's always hooked me with very strong pure dope. I've had a lot of it tested too. He called and said ""Hey, got some #4 Chong and some Tar, I've got some hard Fent going too.""

I asked for 3 bags. I usually buy a lot of stuff and then ration it out fiercely. I ordered a .5 of his Tar and 1.5g of his Chinese White, also ordered 3 Fent pills with it.

I met the guy and he brought me my stuff. I paid him £90 per G so £180 for 2, and then £15 each per pill because they're rare as fuck around where I live.

Day one, I shoot up a .1 of the White, and Jesus Christ. It was the strongest, dankest, warmest, best dope I've ever had in my life. I smoked some Tar later in the evening and I enjoyed that a lot. The next day, I wanted to not take more of my H, so instead I crushed and snorted one of my fent pills. It blew my fucking head off. I can't quite explain how fucking STRONG it was. It's, just beyond anything. After the fent had worn off, I just felt shook because of how strong it was. I shot up a .1 of tar after this to calm me down.

First time I chose to fuck with Fentanyl, and I'm gonna admit I'll probably do it again. It was goood but scary as fuck because it really blew my head off.

Yesterday night I dreamed I had a bit of coke left in my stash and started planning on buying some more to shoot a nice, phat speedball... I didn't get to shoot the speedball in my dream tho. 




After being on a more or less continuous speedball binge since last November, I'm now on my second whole week off coke. That was the first dream of that nature. I'm still using dope daily, but that doesn't incapacitate me nearly as much as speedballs.




When I took my morning shot of plain dope a couple of days ago, it felt unbelievably good. Just that sweet, warm way cinnamon and honey taste, but in my brain. The way it felt in the beginning. How am I ever supposed to cut this out of my life?



That hunger for a high made my tolerance grow out of control. In addition to the maintenance of 1000mg morphine daily I shoot between 0.6g and 2g of dope. 

I need to taper down soon. Neither an increase of my already high maintenance dose nor kicking my dope habit from one day to another are options that will do. If I want to stay functional I need to scrap all my self discipline together and taper down until it's sensible to ask my doc to raise my dose by 100 or 200mg.




  Idk what the maximum prescribable dosage of morphine is, but I fear that a doc assisted taper starting now will involve switching to methadone. And methadone turns me into a useless, nodding zombie.
 



My financial situation is another reason to get a grip. My paycheck is only growing from here on out, but that also means that my credit limit grows with it. I'm already about 3.5kEuro in debt. This isn't the world, but I'd really like to spend some of the money I earn on other things than the basics and drugs. Like new clothes or maybe a new laptop.  




Still, I just spend another 50 bucks on dope and feel a bit helpless about starting the taper. Has anyone experience with tapering down iv dope? I wouldn't mind some advice on how to do this right. Currently I shoot twice in the morning and after work 2 to 5 times. If I miss maintenance, I'll take my gear to work and shoot there 1 to 3 times over an 8hr work day.




Hope everyone is doing splendid! 




TLDR: I dreamt of speedballs after being 2 weeks off em. Still shooting between 0.6 and 2g of dope on top 1000mg morphine maintenance and looking for advice on how to taper the dope habit down to a point where a small raise of the maintenance dose can kill the wd's. ",1538914512.0

First off, I’d like to say that I hope whomever is reading this ends up having a great rest of their day! And takes the time to actually read this personal story I wish to share about myself and my struggles with heroin addiction. I hope I can save someone from slipping down the same tracks that I took. Serious post though, no trolls please. Anyways lol, so yea... as you can guess from the title, I’m a heroin addict. I am 24 years old and have been an opiate user since age 16, with daily use from age 18/19 onwards. I popped oxys mainly from age 16 to 17, and eventually got introduced to dilaudids and morphine, before eventually moving onto smoking/snorting heroin around age 18. I basically “chased the dragon” everyday and was introduced to my first IV usage when I was 19. I will never forget that day... Easily categorized amongst one of the best and worst days of my life until that point. The reason I described it as one of the best, as well as one of the worst days, was because I had never gotten so high in my young life from anything I’d ever done up until that point. It was so intense and amazing that it will forever be a memorable day, but was also the beginning of an unexpected turn to hell mainly due to the fact that my severe addiction to heroin basically stemmed from that incident... I had never injected any drug ever in my life up until the day I first tried IV heroin. From age 19 to 22, I’d spend the majority of my time scoring and banging H, with temporary mini stints in county jails, rehab centers, and halfway houses. I was put on probation for a year for possession of marijuana (3 OZ) and heroin (1.3 grams), but that obviously didn’t stop me from using. It wasn’t until halfway through the age of 22 that I would enroll into a suboxone maintenance therapy program. Suboxone was a wonder drug for me. I struggled  staying fully off heroin for a bit at first but eventually managed to almost make it to 5 months of not using heroin, or any opiate for that matter. That is the longest I’ve ever managed to stay off opiates since I began using opiates at the age of 16,.. and I was taking 8mg suboxone strips once a day everyday for those 4-5ish months. Without suboxone or methadone, the longest I’d ever managed to stay clean off opiates (not including my 60 day jail sentence) was literally 7 days, not even maybe... and that was still with the help of smoking massive amounts of kush and wax, with a Xanax bar every 4-6 hours. My life then consisted of short sobriety periods followed by a few days of relapsing with IV heroin, and repeat. That cycle went on and on, with my life actually showing signs of improvement, regardless of my reoccurring baby relapses... Then one day, my amazing lovely girlfriend of 14 months got tired of putting up with my shit (she only smoked pot and drank occasionally, nothing else) and left me... I’ve been in 4 ‘serious’ relationships in my whole life, and I truly thought this one might’ve been the one. Devastated, I picked up using daily again... And to this very moment of me sharing my story with you all, I have been banging heroin daily, and spending whatever extra money left on xanax, weed, and of course life necessities. Ive worked as a server part-time at many local and chain restaurants for most of my adult life, since dropping out of college at age 19. To fully support myself, as well as my fucking habit, ive had to resort to illegal activities on the side to fully meet my needs as a drug addict. Here I am now; turning 24 in a couple weeks, currently unemployed at this time, using heroin, xanax, drinking alcohol, smoking herb, and occasionally partaking in IV cocaine or IV meth, if it is offered. These last 3 weeks, I’ve actually been enjoying speedballs just about everyday. I am single as shit... My family wants basically nothing to do with me... I am running out of friends I can count on... I’m broke all the time... I mean I’ve honestly probably given all of my heroin dealers atleast $100,000 if I have to honestly make a guess... and that’s just heroin. Surprisingly, if you saw me in person though, you wouldn’t even suspect me of being a hardcore depressed junkie, or so I’ve been told by many. My arms are my only dead give away honestly, but its chilly where I live so sweatshirts ftw. Heroin ruined my life, and I know I might get blasted for only being 24, with a whole life ahead of me, but yo... I honestly feel like I fucked myself worse than the old timers who started late in life. I mean, I have a whole life ahead of me, and I’m literally going to have to live everyday of my life from now on craving heroin, regardless of how much it’s fucked my life up... this shit is fucked and i wish there was a way to somehow spread my personal struggle with this drug, because I believe anybody honestly considering trying out the junkie lifestyle should re-evaluate what they are deciding and realize that this shit really does end up with you being dead, in prison, or severely mentally ill to the point of no return. And you’re going to go through a lot of bullshit along the way until your fate eventually catches up to you. I just shot up 5 hours ago, but I am trying my best to get sober again, or at least gradually decrease my use over time. No suboxone, no methadone; I don’t want MAT (medical assisted treatment) this time. I want to get clean off everything without the help of another narcotic. But it’s hard. Thanks for reading my story, I hope whoever took the time to read all of this actually appreciated me sharing my struggle and would recommend it to anyone taking on the path of opiates for recreational use... because recreational opiate use does not exist... it may seem to exist for so long, but believe me. It eventually gets too expensive, or your supply goes dry leaving you sick, or whatever. Eventually heroin will cross paths with you, and as a pill popper struggling to maintain a good cheap high, you will consider giving it a try. And it will seem like the better alternative at first, due to it being pretty potent now days and readily available. Nobody intentionally wakes up out of nowhere and decides they want to ruin their life with heroin, it just happens... quicker than you may even notice. And when it’s too late, usually it’s too late. Heroin will literally grab you by the balls. Male or female, black or white, rich or poor, gay or straight, none of that matters. Heroin ruins all lives. I can’t even count how many friends of mine died from an overdose. I’ve even overdosed, multiple times actually, between 5 and 7 times. I am lucky to be here and typing this honestly. After even a single overdose, you risk death or irreversible damage... too much lack of oxygen can put you into a permanent vegetative state where you can’t do shit literally on your own. I say all of this true, negative shit about this drug, and am still using it because I can’t stop. That’s how addictive this shit is. Stay strong everybody. ",1538904163.0

What load of shit that is. I had spinal surgery on September 10th at 40ish days clean and then it was OK to accept the script from the doc so long as I took it as prescribed. I did that. I took it just as prescribed. Then, when I finally got into pain management I was honest with the doctor.

&#x200B;

My opioid abuse has primarily been my prescribed medication. There was a time for 7 days in 2017 where I attempted to IV Oxymorphone that was scripted to me, I went through 120 dilaudid tablets in 10 days and I told the doctor that as recently as July 24th-July 29th, 2018 that I did a major fuck it because of pain and snorted heroin for 4 days. My pain doctor won't prescribe, he's prepared me for W/Ds with clonidine and a steroid pack for inflammation. I'm just freaked the fuck out.

&#x200B;

I'm sitting here typing and shaking at a serious 9+ painscore. I called my neurosurgeon early this evening and he said that's normal for a patient 3 weeks out of the type of surgery I had. So I had some validation there. I just made a script that was supposed to be out on October 2nd be out about 18hrs ago. I mean it's not a high dosage but the pain, combined with rebound pain from the opiates, combined with withdrawal symptoms is something that becomes a real problem.

&#x200B;

So I just want to smoke marijuana and get to bed but if I do that I'll be taking a newcomers chip and fuck that. I might not return to the rooms at that point. I don't know, this kind of hurt is so inhumane.",1538900850.0

But for everyone else I'm a normie with sleep and headache issues...

I take ""legal pharma pills"" in front of friends and family, toss a codeine or two (it's OTC here in the UK) to those who need for period pains and headache, I can't stand the sight of anyone suffering, but don't thank me - thank the opiates flowing through my system - easing me into a smile, and making me stop suffering in its tracks with a *one time only* dose of comfort **[seriously the worst thing you can do is let someone else get addicted and drag with you... luckily everyone I try to surround myself with and family takes them very rarely and respects them as they have medical background/knowledge to know about tolerance and want to preserve the effect for when REALLY needed].** 

It's unbecoming to self proclaim JJ, but I try my bestest to give out some 5mg IR oxycodone capsules to those really in need and who take only once a month for occasional pain. I warn everyone **sternly**, and I don't know enough people/friends to help them, because I don't want to be treated differently just because I have a disease, I don't hurt anyone and I function, and only wish I could view myself highly enough that hurting myself (emotionally) is enough of a crime.

I keep getting the urge to leave an oxy with a homeless person, give them the warmth they need on a cold rainy day.... 

I don't know if I think their heroin tolerance is too high to feel oxy 5 mg or it's just I want to keep the money for myself/others, or is it that I don't want them to get addicted?? I can't even decide, but all are factors. Life is complicated, but it's easy to live by the law of common human decency, and the poppy helps me do that, and stops the pain and anger getting between my heart and the heart of another, stranger or friend.

But if I have a job and my emotions slowly fade, no one takes notice and my boss says do whatever you gotta do, mixing instant coffee with powdered milk as she walks out of her office to the meeting, clumps of undissolved brown and white agglutinations foat at the surface, barely visible.

I don't get trackmarks, and my bank account stays at a steady £58 from work, and I passed my exams, which lead to that big promotion.. and i have a doctor's note for sick days... but I could do so much more. I do honestly appreciate how AMAZING I have it and cringe at the fact that I want to boast because I'm high but please God tech me humility, don't let me get too close to the sun on wings of candle wax.

Okay I hope at least one person can relate, I've seen it posted on here about functional addicts that have jobs and families, some lose it all, a tenth of 1% maybe quit while they're ahead or manage to keep 2-3 years of a job before getting on subs.

PSA: SUBS HONESTLY CURE DEPRESSION

Okay it's a drug called [Buprenorphine/samidorphan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine/samidorphan) and it bascially reduces the hgh on the mu receptor (that has morphine like effects vs the oxy-like effects from kappa and delta opioid receptors), via the samidorphan which is like milder naltrexone that takes 80% of the high, leaving thre antidepressant effect! 

It's ""An adjunct to antidepressant therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). [2]"" So alongside it helps especially for those that had an opiate shaped hole in their heart/brain receptors needing to be chemically balanced in a way that doesn't get you high enough to abuse it and tos the balance back away from your favour. It's all about moderation and dosage. 

###[The Dose Makes the Poison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison)

[A 2016 study with 139 participants available free online to look at](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15070921) concludes ""The buprenorphine/samidorphan combination is a novel and promising candidate for treatment of major depressive disorder in patients who have an inadequate response to standard antidepressants.""

It's been known that subs help more than just withdrawal compared to methadone (which actually helps withdrawal but no antidepressant). I'd love to hear from people more experienced with subs as I've only used them 3x sessions and just over days and weeks. So someone who maybe had clinical depression symptoms and got incidentally cured when they quit their opioid of choice for subs detox/maintenance, and how it affected them positive/negative, and any other meds.

I'll post that PSA in a separate thread if anyone thinks it's helping them.

Here’s why I think Suboxone might get rid of opiates out of your system. When you take Suboxone the buprenorphine (and maybe the nalaxone) binds to your opiate receptors and knocks off any opiates that might still be in your system. Well my theory is that when this happens it speeds up the process of getting opiates out of your system.

I’ve been buying kilos and putting it downstairs on top of the fridge and my Kratom use was never a problem. Never made my mom worried and she never had an issue with my use.(I’m 19) She just doesn’t want me to use drugs that are illegal and I respect that.(I need clean pee for my career anyways) My grandma started using Kratom recently after years of chronic pain and failed surgery’s and she said she was getting depressed because of her pain and said that it works better than Percocet or tramadol which she can barely get because of the opioid crisis. If it becomes illegal in Ohio I’m sure other states will follow suit and and eventually it’ll be federally legal. But it’ll create a massive underground need for it and it’ll potentially be laced and way too over priced. It’s an amazing substance that makes my quality of life 10 times better and I’m sad to see that it might go away. I absolutely hate the corrupt government in the United States and I’m thinking about moving to Canada as soon as I can.

The more I want off them the more they seem to be accessible I remember looking for days trying to find pills and taking whatever I can get. Now I'm getting phone calls almost everyday from people who have them. 
I can afford them because I worked my ass off doing side jobs after work everyday (i do concrete) and I was saving the money to take my girlfriend and I on a big vacation. Well that idea is gone. 
The sad part is I'm not even taking it as much as some of the serious addicts. I take anywhere between 10-15  10mg hydrocodone a day.
Only this time it's different. I want them during the day where as I used to only take them after work. My sex drive is fucked. I am horny during the day but when I get home and take the pills sex is the last thing I want to do, we have sex maybe once a week.

Was watching some vice piece on how a dad who lost his daughter to heroin said he'd kill every heroin dealer, and some reporter put a camera in the face of some dealer being arrested yelling ""how does it feel knowing you're ruining families?"". 

These dealers did not come to my house in the middle of the night and force feed me heroin. WE hit up dealers to get our fix, and by blaming the dealers we're ignoring the plethora of societal, mental, and financial issues that contribute to drug addiction. The only possible way a dealer can be blamed is if he is providing product that is not legitimate: I know the risks associated with ordering Burger King, I would not blame them for my health, and I know the risks associated with heroin, so I do not go to the dealer and say ""well fuck! Why would you let me make a conscious decision as an adult!"".

Question about withdrawal/dosage/length of habit.,"After some bad experience with back pain, I ended up with a heroin habit I never meant to cop (though I suppose no one ever does.)

Its been about 2 years, and I've never used more than a gram a day. My average for the last 6 months is a half gram, 3/4ths of a gram *max*, and in the last month or so, I've been stretching my dosages out so that many of them are at least 12 hours apart. I know for a fact that as little as .10ish can keep me solid for about 12 hours and .20 holds me for *at least* anywhere from 10 to even 20 hours sometimes, which makes me wonder just how bad my withdrawals would be if I stopped cold turkey. Tapering seems to be a little difficult for me, as I tend to sometimes use just to relax every now and again, and it interferes with my dedication to tapering, not to mention, sometimes I need to use to get me through a work shift or a daily outing or routine. It would be much easier, I think, to just put my mind to quitting, so long as the wd isn't going to be too terrible.


Anyone have any experience in this area? Low dosage usage, I never get ""gacked"" to where I'm falling out all over the place. Only ever take enough to just kind of relax and calm my anxiety. Individual dosages are between .10 and .20, and they can keep me good for half a day at least. Usually do 3 or 4 shots a day, anywhere between .10 and .20, never more than 3/4ths of a gram a day (usually more like 1/2).

Almost wondering if maybe wds might be mild enough to cold kick.

Thoughts and advice thoroughly welcomed and much appreciated.

I hope I'm not violating rules by posting this here. I stupidly tried legal advice first. Ha. I suppose that shows exactly how naive and idiotic I can be. I'm a drug/alcohol counselor. Its my second career and one that will be ending very soon. I chose to enter this field years after I graduated with a B.S. in bio/chemistry and a nursing license. I'm in a part of the country with a terrible rate of overdoses. Just to be clear up front, I do not consider drugs to be evil and I have my doubts about how much 'good' our laws do. I believe our entire legal system just makes the situation worse and the current crusade against opiates is ruining lives. it isn't likely I would have been able to stay at my current job for long anyway but an incident occurred that clinched it for me. It was very unrealistic of me to ever believe that the facility I work for exists to help people. It does not. It exists to make money. They own multiple 'apartment complexes' that are supposedly for people in recovery. They cost 4 times as much as a normal apartment in this area and they bully people into taking leases there using the legal system. Thats pretty much their M.O. for everything. Use the legal system to bully people. 

&#x200B;

I have one client who is very likely going to be maxing out a sentence in state prison after she goes in front of the judge. She is the county jail right now. I am very upset because I believe the drug test that got her the violation was manipulated. I've been working with her for over a year and she has not had a dirty test for me in 13 months. She would have been finished with probation Monday if she hadn't been violated. She has had violations in the past and has been dealing with probation, jail, recovery cycles for years all dating from the same original charges. She just couldn't break out of it until she started methadone therapy, but she was doing very well on the methadone. I'm just going to quickly explain the situation. Maybe I am mistaken but I don't think so.

&#x200B;

She takes methadone and our closest clinic does not allow take-home for more than a weekend for people on probation. She had to go to the clinic and get her daily dose except saturday and sunday. She came to our facility on a Wednesday. I wasn't there because I was working as a nurse in inpatient due to staffing issues. Another counselor 'helped' her and gave her a random urine test. No big deal. She was clean, or so she thought. I didn't think it would be an issue either. I come to find out 2 days later on our normally scheduled appointment that the other counselor expedited the lab results of the test she gave and didn't use an instant strip. The lab results showed heroin and xanax. They did not show any methadone. None. The drug test I gave on her normal day to meet with me, 2 days later, showed just methadone in the instant test. When I received the lab results, 9 days later and my client was already sitting in jail, it was the same. There was nothing but her prescribed methadone. The results were very similar to the test I had given her the previous Friday. The time between the test friday and the test from the other counselor on a wednesday was 5 days, then another 2 days  after the 'positive' to the next test I gave her on the friday of that week.

&#x200B;

I'm aware people can fake drug tests but thats not easy to do on maintenance therapy. She would have to make sure the fake/stored urine had methadone in it. We do observed drug tests at our facility. So does the methadone clinic. So does probation. Thats a lot of places and a lot of drug tests to manage fake urine through observed tests. I don't think it could be done. No one is that good or that lucky, not to mention that sometimes the methadone clinic just does oral swabs. We have them too and I used one of them the day I obtained the last urine sample from her as well because I had already been told she had a dirty urine and I didn't believe it. The oral test also showed just methadone. 

&#x200B;

My question for anyone who cares to answer, is this: Is it possible for someone on methadone maintenance therapy to have a negative drug test (for methadone) in between two tests showing a positive for methadone in the span of 7 days? I don't think it is. I know methadone has a very long half-life and I just do not see any way that could be possible. She even had her dose of methadone the morning of the drug tests that supposedly contained xanax and heroin, but not methadone. Xanax can get iffy but I don't think a drug test Friday could have been negative for it when she had a fairly high amount show up Wednesday. The facility I work for forces people to sign consents for their counselors and supervisors to release information to probation/parole and even the police. The addition of the police to those forms is new. I find it all upsetting and completely worthless. I do not think people can actually benefit from therapy of any sort when counselors can't be trusted. I don't use the consents I have. They sit in a drawer and I do not call and turn people in. Most of my colleagues do, then they use probation/parole to get clients into longer treatment programs, force them to live in the insanely expensive apt complexes 'managed' by the facility, or force people into the long-term inpatient rehab located in a different part of the state. The counselor who called and informed my client's PO of the dirty urine didn't even have the authority to do that. One of my supervisors could have, but not another counselor. We're not allowed to access and disclose information on each other's clients. 

&#x200B;

 I think its all just a money-making scheme at this point but now someone who should have been a success story is looking at time in state prison and I don't know how to help her. I just dont think the drug test results could possibly have turned out like that. Am I wrong? Do I just have too much hope for my clients and I'm letting it cloud my judgment? That is what I'm being told at work and the people at the legal advice sub told me I was a complete fool and my client was lying. I searched that sub and found other posts from people along similar lines. All of them were told that it was ridiculous, addicts lie, don't be stupid, except one. The one they all piled on board with in shared outrage was posted by a lawyer whose wife was caught up in drug testing at a hospital maternity ward. Of course they believed him. He's a lawyer, of course his wife's drug test was a false positive. The husband noted a threat from a counselor in his post and just flat out stated that the counselor told him the test could turn out positive whether his wife used or not so he should really think about that. They believed him. I believe him too, but I find it very upsetting that he gets the benefit of the doubt simply for being a lawyer while everyone else is either lying or an idiot. ",1538850331.0

Constantly relapse or supplement and use on top of it. 

Recently went to detox and got out and within a few days had an overdose. 

Suboxone causes me major drug rashes/allergy that leaves red mark's all over my chest that seriously hurt and causes major nausea. That and for some reason I can use on top of the subs and get high off this fentanyl shit that's everywhere.    

As for methadone I generally puke everyday after taking my dose and if I do manage to hold it down I'm nauseous the whole day and have major dysphoria, totally lethargic and apathetic and my sleep cycles are just murdered. 

So I decided to change my maintenance clinic as the other methadone clinic I go to is not meeting my needs at all. Saw a new doctor at a new clinic and this clinic seems much more progressive and open to new alternatives for treatment. I saw an extremely thorough and intelligent Asian doctor who seemed incredibly interested in his job and what he was doing. This guy was more knowledgeable then any addiction doctor I have ever seen. Literally was asking me the consistency and colour of the fent/heroin I was using and could list off what was in each batch based on his patients and what type they were using since he asks them all and categorizes it. 

So after listening and realizing I don't do well on either of these drugs he switched my 90mg methadone dose to 360mg of kadian slow release morphine and also gave me clonidine and trazodone if the switch is rough at all. Will be going up 40mg a day until iam stable and settled. This was also because I have a history of chronic pain and he deemed this alot more suitable. The other good thing about this clinic is they actually have end game for tapering down unlike alot of methadone clinics. 

All I have to say is I have a new appreciation for canadian addiction doctors and clinics that are open to all means of maintenance and not just suboxone or methadone. One size does not always fit all.

Got myself into a little predicament and figured the good people on R/opiates would be the place for help.

I have been on and off opiates heavily my entire adult life ( going on 14 years). Once I started I hit the ground running and did not look back. I've pretty much always been either strung out on pills or in Suboxone/subutex maintenance. 

Around a year ago moved away from my hometown to a new city, away from all my accumulated plugs. Here the only thing available ive been able to find is shitty H or unbelievably good pressed Roxy's. Which I know for sure are fentanyl because have used a test kit on quite a few.

I have been using these daily for about 3 months. During which time my tolerance and dependence has skyrocketed. 

I just got my best friend from back home to hook me up with some Suboxone ( wish it was Subutex but Beggars can't be picky). It is time to kick the habit, it's a dangerous and very expensive one.

I have never been hooked on fent and have no clue how long to wait before taking a suboxone. So my question is how long to wait after the last dose of fent before I take the sub? 

I definitely do not want to end up in precipitated withdrawals..

I only have five 8 mg Subs and would also love some advice on best way to take / taper off with them.

I have Sunday off but work Monday through Friday next week and cannot be a useless mofo. 

Any advice would be awesome.

Summary : have been using fent Daily for 3 to 4 months. Got 5 Suboxone strips. How long to wait to take to avoid withdrawals, and any advice on correct / best taper ?

Thanks guys

Weve all been there take your whatever dose and an hour and a half later you want to take more, so you do and the high is non existent or underwhelming. Oxycodone needs at least 8 hours between doses to feel the effect, or wait till you get wd symtoms and the high will be even better. 

For Me aswell there is a ceiling dose of 80mg/day, if i use anymore than that i wont get high anymore.Everyone has this my friends and i call it the point of no return when you use to much and wont get high off your normal dose anymore.

Posting from a throwaway. I found 17 pills in a little ziploc baggie in between the trash can and the trash bag in a public restroom in the retail store I work at. Google tells me they're Purdue 2mg Dilaudid (hydromorphone). In accordance with the rules of this sub I removed the pictures and i am not asking anybody here to verify the pills that I have found. I will go a little deeper into the sidebar and pick up a more accurate scale before I make any decision. At the first sign of bootlegery they will be promptly destroyed. I am curious though about fake pills in general. I live within walking distance of one of the big big heroin/fent cities on the east coast, and have to deal with straight up fiends on a daily basis. From my kind of outsider point of view, heroin seems to be vastly more popular around here. In this kind of environment, are fake pills more common, or less common due to less demand? Once again this has no bearing on what i found today just curious. 

I dabbled with opiates in my teens and early 20s, mostly percs and lower mg oxy (or whatever was around in the mid 00s) and never developed a habit. Never did IV, mostly sniffed or chewed. Aside from 2 legit scrips for vicodin for dental work, I haven't done any opiates in a decade. When I got the scrips, I would take more than i needed on the first day or two, definitely beyond what the doc would have recommended,  but never had any withdrawal symptoms afterward. I like the high, but am very aware of the risks of getting hooked. Addiction runs in my family, I fought with alcoholism for years (3yrs sober). 

So here is my plan with these pills and I would like your opinion. I leave for vacation tomorrow. I am not taking them with me. That way I have a few days to look at your responses and be somewhat responsible. I got a few days off between vacation and work, so I will act then. I am going to give most of them away. I have somebody in mind but I don't know if giving him that much at once is too much. I'm pretty sure he's not a heavy user, and  he is experienced. I don't think it would be enough,  but that's why i'm asking you. I fairly certain he is not an IV user, I think that makes a big difference) 

I want to save 2-3 for the first aid kit. I also plan on saving one recreational dose, enough to keep me comfortably numb for the evening. Going to wait to party until after I give the others away, that way if I really do like them, I can't just blast through the whole pile. I know I said I live real close to a real big drug city but i don't know what block to go down or who or what to ask for. I haven't bought drugs on a street corner in a very long time. Unless I really overdo it I don't see this happening. I can handle being sick for a few days, I did it with alcohol on multiple occasions. Difference is i didn't know i was an alcoholic until it was too late.  

**TLDR/Questions**


1. Do you think dropping ~10 of these on my buddy's lap going to be too much of a good thing? Again, i think he'd be ok, he has a really good temperment and i never seen him nod or all whacked out... just looking for some opinions. 


4. Recommended recreational dose and ROA (no iv)? Enough for one night, . I'm 30s male 155lbs 5'8"" i have tried lower to mid strength opiates on many occasions in the past but never developed a habit. Daily cannabis, caffeine, nicotine user. no alcohol. I did read the sidebar, but it was a little too much for me to grasp with any confidence.


5. Street value?


6. Am I an idiot and this is all a bad idea? I found them in the trash ffs...


7. Actually, I found them *hidden* underneath the trash bag. What do you think that was about? Since i'm on vacation i won't be able to see if on of my fellow employees loses his mind or calls out sick, or if it was some paranoid customer hiding his shit then he forgot it. Maybe a dead drop and I fucked up somebody's pickup? terrible place to hide that much stuff. but i'm on vacation....😎🍍🌴

Sure we have great binges, it's what keeps us consumed in the darkness... And happily willing to risk it all for them. But, I have to overcome the slavery. The chains are becoming weaker and I'm getting stronger every day. It's possible.

Day #3 after a small week relapse. I was on day #11before that. It happens and honestly I needed the dopamine boost to overcome my paws depression I was sinking into. I went on walks today. I genuinely laughed. I was able to function, handle tasks, with patience and not give into the fire of overwhelming irritability that has been unleashing the wrath of hell on those around me. It's happening, and tbh I didn't even really want to quit, but I'm becoming more and more motivated with each milestone I hit. 

I'm not going to be blindsided by the depression and suicidal ideations from paws this time. I'm ready for it, and if I have to take another break then so be it. Don't beat yourselves up for making a mistake... Find the pros and fucking embrace the positives. It is all we have... Unless we decided to let that demon grab our leg and pull us right back to the hell we are all so comfortable in. Guess what? It fucking sucks down here. It's hot, we're all sweating our asses off, drying up from the inside out, our thoughts are engulfed by one thing and one thing only, and it's become our end goal. There is nothing else beyond our DOC when we are stuck in the viscous cycle. 

Are you even happy? I wasnt. I remember the natural dopamine. I remember waking up and my first thought being coffee... Not how the fuck am I going to score, Counting my pills, popping whatever I have in my safety stash to avoid being sick, counting the hours before I should dose next, attempting to taper and then getting to that time and popping more than I should, then the regret fucks my high and I'm left anxious. Ffs. I really hate the lifestyle. Love the high, but I'm not a fucking slave.

The warmth Ive come to love feeling is fake... I've been hunched over in the middle of a fucking blizzard with a box of matches... And I'm all out. I swear that little light I get a glimpse of is warmer than ever. I want it.

Longest I've been clean from oxy in over a year. I'm almost over the withdrawals, other then having a little bit of RLS, but if I take a bit of Kratom then that is gone.

When I take oxy I can usually get decent euphoria off of 25-30 mg of oxy. I was looking at the opioid dosing chart and see that Suboxone/Bupe is about 40 times as strong as hydrocodone and so itd make Bupe about 27 times as strong as Oxycodone. So in theory 1 mg of Sub would be as strong as 27 mg of Oxy.

I need to get off this shit and prior to my relapse I had stayed in s medical detox facility for 8 days and went through 6 days of straight insomnia afterwards before I felt better. 

I cant go back to detox. I dont have the financial means or health insurance. My buddy gets a prescription for 8mg subutex and I have 3 quarters of one already. I have no idea how I should taper myself with the subutex. I also use kratom daily when I'm not on an opiate binge. I can probably buy some Korean subutex from my friend. In detox they gave me 4mg the first 2 days morning and night then 2mg morning and night the next two days then I suffered for the following 4. I feel that taper was too quick and i need something that will make the insomnia less brutal. 

I feel like if i have a detox plan mapped out I'll be able to commit and get the fuck off this horrible shit again. I'm in a financial situation where I absolutely cannot be using everyday but here I am.

Basically, our society is too safe. In shaman based communities they regularly face epidemics and injury that we avoid. When 20,000 die to a particular cause and yet a couple barely survive, having come close to death, those people become the shamans. Having danced with death and returned against great odds is what qualifies one to shamanism. We don't have many analogous situations in the 1st world. But running the streets shooting dope / fentanyl seems pretty spot on to me. I found my way out of 23 yrs of addiction, 14 of them on the needle, through plant medicines among many other things. Dmt, mushrooms, Syrian rue, etc. Not only the way out of addiction but also a way into the best and only journey worth addressing. The journey inside. Where the real conflict exists and so too does the real and lasting resolution. Just food for thought. I did 12 steps very seriously for a year and a half, lots of spiritual seeking, meditation, etc. Plant medicines were a big part too though.

Just like in that experiment with the morphine and the rats. But anyway, today, as I watch T crumble as her daughter got arrested (she's already on parole so she is definitely going back to jail for any infraction or violation at this point), I grabbed onto T and told her it would be okay and that I loved her.  


And truthfully, I do love her. She and her husband do my dirty work for me basically. They take the bigger risk, selling to me than I do buying from them. Do I love her because I am using her? I don't think so. These are genuine feelings from a genuine person. I spend my TIME with these people, real time because we don't act like strangers. We all know what each other fixes on. We hang out and we live in that mucky house with each other because we *understand* each other. Now, I say mucky house, and I mean **mucky.** This place is never clean. The couple I buy from live there with two of three of T's children with another man. The kid(s) (now that B just got arrested again idk if I should really say it plural) but anyhow J & B (the kids of the house) did their share of dirty work to keep the place clean so they weren't so embarrassed to have friends over. J will continue to clean what he can, he's kind like that. He cares. He smokes pot, bless his little heart. He hasn't fucked with any of the shit we know now that we never shoulda fucked with, am I right? Anyway, I'm trying to paint a fucking picture of this trailer for you guys, do you see it yet?

&#x200B;

Okay.   


Anyway, we spend our fucking time together, doing what we do best, *together,* and is it a fucked up dynamic? You fucking  bet dude. It's unapologetic in there. We have no sorrow or regret, we all know that we love something more than each other and it's okay with us.... **WE KNOW.** We literally know each other's every move, dirty little secret, because we aren't afraid of hiding. And is that what we're all hiding from....? We are all hiding bits and pieces of our lives from the normies in our lives because we know that they usually have a lesser opinion of us. But I know so many people like me, who use drugs, and they are fucking brilliant, man. Brilliant. Some of the smartest people I know also have NEVER used drugs. Some have. The difference is that the people who have dipped their feet in the opipool, we already felt that hook. That pull to love something more than yourself. Holy shit I need to fix the way this sounds.... **(*****DISCLAIMER:*** *this is not to romanticize drugs, these are just my personal feelings written out, if you haven't done this drug do not turn anything I am saying as a reason to try opiates, I ruined my entire fucking life.***)** The difference is, we have felt it. And we can relate to one another. We can ACTUALLY relate to how the other feels. Because when it's gone, it makes you physically ill and most people cannot imagine what it feels like... to have something ripped away and when it is to so quickly turn violently ill. Most people have never endured it to the point where... they can't even IMAGINE it, they couldn't fathom the way that feels. But in that shitty fucking house we all help make sure that no one ever gets ill. We help each other. We do. I mean it's really that fucking simple. And I think that honestly the few times I've been robbed there are because for some reason they were afraid to ask. But I still go back. Because I understand those people. And I know what it's like to need. And I know they'd never get violent with me over it, but I just try to remind myself I would have helped them anyway, and just not get mad over it. When time comes, they will get me back. Hell, he's given me deals a few times which I am sure were just at cost really, but whatever. The point is, I can see why a person does some things wrong. I understand that humans re capable of being so passionate for something, that they'd do something crazy to get it. It's like pavlov's dogs. It's exactly the same. We are conditioned and it's that simple. We understand what it's like to feel like nothing but a machine, 1) get drugs 2) use drugs 3) function and act human through the day 4) nod the fuck out and destroy that reminder that you played pretend all day, and just like that *a well oiled machine.* 

&#x200B;

I thought I was referring to myself as an overfeeler and didn't want to romanticize drug use and now I'm referring to myself as a literal robot so idk where I was ever actually going with this. But my point is, I may be a robot, but I do still have feelings. I am not completely lost. None of us are. But we are lost. We are still walking aimlessly with nowhere to go right now. Because the traditional paycheck to paycheck user doesn't have a savings account. There's nowhere we can just ""pick up and pack our bags to"". There's nothing beyond the place we have now, in all it's mucky glory, and each other. So how do you get out? I mean really. Where can I go besides an expensive ass rehab that I'll never be able to afford? I mean the problem with addiction is that there aren't enough CHEAP resources for help. It's been hundreds of years since they used milk of the poppy for healing remedies. We've known for years what it can do to destroy you and no one has put anything in effort to make this stop? Instead of finding a way to rehabilitate people we find a cure. Idfk what I'm saying. I'm certain I'm talking nonsense now because I don't know what we could do. But maybe making people more socially aware and just not so judgemental and, you know, then we could ALL live our truths. I know that's bullshit. I know there will always be the negative people that can pick the side to look down on us as ""scum"", because I hear users referred to as this for the longest time, so I know that's what people think... but maybe it's not the same. Maybe since they don't know what it's like to need something so badly so they can't picture the alternative that it's just not possible for them to feel that deep of empathy for us either? I guess I can even understand that. 

&#x200B;

It's a weird fucking world out there today. A weird fucking world. And I wish I knew more every day. And I think I know a decent amount. But I learn every day. Being a user has not taken that from me. I still want to learn every day. I want to see more perspectives every day. I want to pay more attention to everyone's emotions and body language every day so I can be there, as a human. I want so much more and maybe when I do finally gain my sobriety, maybe before that time, I can understand others and read them so well that I can be there for them. My ultimate goal is to be there for others and help them through whatever phase of life they need it. I want the material stuff too, a home, a dog and a yard, love of my life, I want that shit too I mean, fuck yeah I do. I want the white picket fence and EVERYTHING. I want a nice place that's clean to call my own. And maybe I'll get there. I really fucking hope I get there. ",1538750365.0

Or is the DEA evil for cracking down on them? Seems kind of hypocritical.,"I brought this up before and got highly downvoted, I'd like to have a discussion on it. I can't be the only one that finds it incredibly hypocritical that there seems to be a big trend in online drug communities to hold two views: 

&#x200B;

1) That doctors/purdue/big pharma are all evil for pushing opiates in the late 90s/early 2000s so hard. Personally I think you could maybe describe it as predatory but I believe in personal responsibility. For a community that preaches personal responsibility with drugs so hard I think it's odd people hop on the victim-politics band wagon with this one. Adults should know that opiates are addicting. I'm no fucking genius but I remember knowing what addiction and dependence were when I was young, and that opium almost ruined china, etc. I don't understand people that get prescribed a medication and don't even research it. I think most people on this sub would agree with me on personal responsibility but suddenly when it comes to prescribing pills we're somehow no longer at fault. I personally blame treatment centers for pushing this ""iTz NoT uR FaulT\~\~"" narrative. 

&#x200B;

2. DEA is evil for cracking down on pain med prescriptions. Now I didn't agree with #1 but I do agree with this one. My point is that I don't see how 1 and 2 mesh. It seems like you if you believe that you just want to play both sides of the fence and not take responsibility for your own addiction.  


I'm not saying I'm right and everyone else is wrong, I'm just curious what other peoples views are on this. I personally started abusing opiates when I was 15 after being prescribed 30 days of hydro.

So I came across 2 full and 2 mostly empty blister packets of these tablets, which are go by the tradename ""Meptid"".  

There is next to no information about them on the internet, as far as I've found so far that is anyway. Oh! I just remembered that it's been suggested to search things on Bing now rather than Google isn't that right? Derp, will get on that after I post this and see what I can dig up over there!  

  

Anyway I was wondering whether any of my good fellows on this sub have any experience with these bad boys- well, you can bet your ass that I'm hoping that they're ""bad boys"" haha y'all know it!  

I came cross one old Reddit post last night discussing it and by all accounts, they sounded pretty lame in that discussion.  

But if they are the tablets my sister told me the doctor gave her when she messed up her Subutex prescription and went into WD's earlier this year- very weird situation am I right?- they might be good because she said they made her gouch; that is to say, they made her nod big time! So if they made her nod, surely they're going to be enjoyable right?  

They're 200mg, red and oval shaped hard pills which are white inside. I took one last night, but the results were negligible if anything because I'd done nearly a half a teenth of gear smoked and shot in the hours preceding it, so wasn't sure if anything I felt was that or the tablet I took. I knew it was pointless to bother but the fiend in me got his way and I took one.  

  

The gear alone made sure that I barely slept last night too, so now I'm pretty tired and could probably get straight to sleep if I go and try. I may just do that. I don't know when my opiate receptors will be sufficiently empty to be properly able to judge the effect of these tablets so yeah guys, over to you on this one!  

  

Cheers and stay safe and well! Thanks for your time.",1538733550.0

Yesterday I snorted 20mg of oxycodone and the day before too. I didn’t felt that high so I want to take it orally today because I heard that you get higher wen taking oral than snorting. I am planning on taking 30mg which I will remove the coating and crush it up and mix it in a small shot glass with some cola. I have original OC. Also I’ve done oxycodone just a few times in my life so I have no tolerance. 

On what kind of stomach should I take it and will 30mg be enough ? I want to get really high so hope that the dosage is fine. My experience with snorting was not intense at all so I hope that will change when taking it oral.

I have a diagnosis. I have MRIs that show my neck and jaw are fucked .

This motherfucker, 

I call him, and tell him, that the Tizanidine makes me vomit when i take it

He wont even change it for me

I tell him the Tramadol works, but only sometimes, and it does kill all of the pain, and he gives me LESS tramadol than last time?


Im just really sick of being treated like a fucking junkie because i take Suboxone. If i did have an opioid abuse problem, it was so fucking long ago that i dont even remember it. :|

Even if i was a junkie, hes not entitled to do this to me


His assistant, a younger woman, was much nicer to me, said i could have any muscle relaxer i wanted, and she gave me 90 of them. 

I am relly beginning to believe that these doctors just refer you to other people so they do not have to deal with you

I HAVE FOLLOWED MY DOCTORS INSTRUCTIONS AND CONTINUE TO FOLLOW HIS INSTRUCTIONS

but my point is that i cannot rely on this man for anything

i asked him for suppositories for my bleeding rectum and he wouldn't give them to me until i called him crying from all these fucking problems that i have because i dont know what to deal with first


So im doing as follows:

Pain management - Triggerpoint injections and whatver they have to offer

-

Chiropractor, Accupuncture, Phys therapy

I feel like i need a neurologist that specializes in facial pain. 


We have conclude that i may not actually have TMJ but imay have something stemming from a neck injury. Its very very hard 


I can barely even talk to people and these fucking people shrug it off and everytime is ee a doctor i am STRAINING myself to talk to them. i want to go to the fuckin gemergency room everyday and these people barely fucking listen to me 


So now i have gotten to the point where i may begin recording these doctor interactions and poting them online as this shouldn't happen to anyone whether they're a fucking junnkie or not this is just horrendous healthcare opioid bullshit

i didn't ask him for the tramadol btw

but i did tell him that i haven't used drugs in over 10 years . and that im very proud of it . but obviously he doesnt give a fucking shit

my dentist was more willing to prescribe something to relieve pain

these people are fucking assholes

only like maybe 2 out of 10 doctors were legitimately careing . and those doctors are not my personal doctors but people that i wound up seeing over the course of trying to treat whatever the fuck i got going on

Originally i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia

Then TMJ

and now...? Neck tumors? i have no fucking idea . the MRI was EXTREMELY painful. They removed any cushion available and stuck a rod in my mouth which i then had to open a very small amount everytime they took the photo . since then the pain has been off the charts and i wake up screaming and i am scaring my family

i even told the doctor this and he just doesnt give a fuck

i am considering changing my primary doctor to a suboxone doctor because atleast the suboxone doctor would fukcing listen to me

but i already have a great suboxone doctor , he just doesnt go into the areas of pain, he would give me lyrica, but its not covered by insurance, i do feel like lyrica could help me, just very expensive


i've spent over $1000 on ointments, ive spent over $900 on a piece of shit bite guard that doesnt work at all.

im wasting money 

could have probably bought 10 oxycontin and legitimately have felt better by actually taking the pain away. keep in mind i only type this because i feel as if i am actually legitimately beginning to get depressed . ive tried so hard to keep my head up but it is impossible when everyone is against you no matter waht you do in life!",1538709524.0

Ive been taking extremely low amounts of Suboxone.

In combination with a decent diet.

I am in extreme pain , as you may know.

But, my doseage has always gone down because i have been able to keep my anxiety down.

But within the past couple of days, my anxiety went crazy!

As i seem to be getting no help for my pain problem, as i am looked at like a junkie

TL;DR: I required more suboxone / bupe under stress than not being in stress. even taking two or three times as much did nothing. infact, it may be counterproductive

Please be aware that your stress and anxiety level will effect your doseages

Please.

I wish i knew this 10 years ago

That running around the house, fixing shit, while in pain, and having anxiety, thinking about 30 different things at once, you're not thinking about relaxing. you're not allowing yourself the relaxation so that your body can feel that drug that you're taking

I realize most people will be like ""THATS A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT""

Similar to my previous posts on health, diet, & doseage.

But maybe this will help 1 person that wants to lower their dose:

Keep a good diet, a great diet (if you're shitting bricks that is horrible. )

And take small amounts

And try to remain stress free or go into a zen mode!

Trust me that the meds will be far more effective

I do not have anything else to say other than, i have now seen Drs, whom have referred me to other doctors, each of which says something different is wrong with me . ive pretty much given up hope of doctors , as its too stressful to think about.


but yea. this is me. this is how i feel after  15 years of taking opiates and 11 years of ONLY suboxone . 

The only med other than Suboxone that i have touched, which was recently, was Tramadol , which was prescribed to me for extreme pain  .

Both my plugs randomly have just disappeared and won't pick up either phone.

Obviously since I'm not a constant user that calls them all the time I did not get a call for the new numbers. 

Went down by the safe injection site someone said they could do 4 bags for 100. I should have only bought like 25$-50$ that way it wouldnt have been such a big deal I was just desperate and not thinking. So the person even let me see the bag and it looked normal just more white which stuff goes around that is white like this that is buffed fent. Go and check it out and of course it's some vitamin shit like taurine. Made alot of sense afterwards why the person sealed the top of the bag so crazy. Obviously I was annoyed but I dunno I dont pay rent currently so it isn't the end of the world. Also thankfully after the fact I found the girl who had served me purple dope the other day and we went on adventure to go cop and the 50 I spent with her was actually a proper 2 points and decent quality stuff ( not purple or coloured seems less fenty) even though she said she didn't like this batch and usually gets better. 

At least I found a middle that's always downtown by the safe injection site. Doesnt have a phone but she should get one in a few days. Honestly maybe it was worth getting burned 100 to get a decent relationship with this connect considering she used my phone and had tons of dealers. I would call them but I can tell her dealers need a referral and I would get chewed out for calling and the middle might get told and then I'm screwed.

I had a drug test at my doctors office to make sure I didn't test for anything off the wall or illicit. They're sending the results to a lab for full evaluation. So, me being me, and being super paranoid about random drugs showing up tests herself with one of her dori instant tests at home.

I came up positive for exactly what I thought I would:

* THC - likely a low level of it since I rarely EVER smoke & am in a legal state
* Benzos - Duh, I've been on valium post op
* Opiates - Yes, I've been on those consistently, since surgery but will be out in a day or two. MmmmK.
* Suboxone was inconclusive .... my last dose was 45 days ago so likely a non issue.

Here's where I'm concerned:

Methadone. I tested fucking positive for methadone. I would fly to australia if someone put methadone in front of me so I KNOW it's a false positive. What I don't know is if lab testing will reveal that or ??? I've scoured the web looking for things that can cause a false methadone positive and so far the only thing that came up that it MIGHT be the benadryl. With that said, the only other thing i can think of is that it must've been in the heroin I tried 67 days ago but I highly doubt it would be THAT long lasting in my system?

To protect myself from the chance that my medical records were examined by the court I'd prefer that there was no mention of anything H related. 

If I do tell the dr. I am on MMT I wonder if he would give me more pain meds to break thru and actually relieve the pain or if he'd take the other route and assume the methadone would work for my post op pain and not want to risk prescribing an addict any more opiates than he had to

Not to mention I miss the warmth, even though the feelings aren't as amazing as they used to be.

Here's the backstory: introduced to percocet 15yrs ago, absolutely loved it. I felt energized, productive, happy, it was amazing. Ive been chasing this high for years, but haven't felt it in at least 5yrs. After 5 straight years of percocet, morphine and oxy I felt it took over my life and I decided I had to quit. Cold turkey quit, counting every hour and marking them down in a notebook (attempting to feel accomplished every hour I abstained) and felt like dying. I did use weed and lots of hot showers and music to get through. I did it, and stayed clean for probably a year.

After a year, my brain remebered the amazingness and I relapsed. Blah blah same shit until I couldn't get percs anymore and started with the oxys. I loved them. Used another year and quit again for 2 years. Started back up after an injury and haven't once had that energizing, productive, warm high ive been chasing. I've just been feeling so unmotivated, don't even want to get out of bed, just nod, wake up and medicate, only to nod more... All day.

So... My brain is stuck remembering how amazing it once was, I justify taking another because at this point I just want to sleep and feel happy/relaxed, but what's the point? I know I won't get that awesome high I used to, I know I won't feel motivated and generally ""better"" at all, I'll have to reset AGAIN, and I'm not even really happy when I take them anymore. So why the hell do I want to so bad? 

Also, I did a reset 2 weeks ago and went 11days before the depression and suicidal thoughts made me relapse. Scary shit. So I went a week taking 10mg a day and now I'm back to 2 days clean. Well, 40.5 hours clean.",1538688714.0

*Before that: On and Off Use of 10 to 15 Grams since November 17.*

To the question: Is this normal after prolonged period of opiate abuse? I abused before for long periods but always had at least tiny pupils as a side effect. Has someone else experienced this? Is this because of tolerance, or could there be something fucked organicaly?

I certainly did. In fact, when I went into substitution and they asked me for my family history followed by my personal history of drugs (first time trying weed, first time speed, coke, MDMA, etc) I realised for the first time properly just how much I fulfilled the classic pattern of an addict: exposed to drugs at an incredibly young age, tried each new one at a younger age than others around me, used other substances compulsively, genes inherited from a long line of addicts, abusive home life that included trauma I wasn't really able to handle on my own but for a long time didn't even truly understand or recognise...In fact, it's only recently that I realised that I was a poster child for addiction - a close family member was giving me amphetamines when I was fucking 10 years old, and I first had a line of coke aged 12. In that context, it's a miracle I only tried smack when I was 23 and after having graduated from university...

Anyway, apologies for the slightly drug-addled detour. The reason I'm posting is because having gone pretty much directly to heroin, the only withdrawals I know are from smack or substitution. I'm not sure which is worse; methadone is milder but it last forever compared to heroin and both turn me into a desperate insomniac for months. But I've never had to go cold turkey from fentanyl, dilaudid, oxycodone or any other pharmaceutical opiates.

Are they different from coming off heroin? Easier? Worse? I'd like to know. For what it's worth, I lived for a while in New York and took oxys there but not enough to get hooked on them specifically - I was taking ECP as well. When I binged on oxys (snorting them), I'd get a horrible headache that I never experienced from smack. The high, in general, felt artificial in a way that I'd never experienced before. I read a lot of posts here where people describe unpleasant symptoms that I associate with oxys but not heroin - headaches, neuralgia, migraines, troubled dreams...

So - right - what I'm wondering is: are withdrawals from synthetic opiates different from coming off heroin and, if so, in what way? If you had to (and I mean had to) choose one opiate to come off, which would it be? And, conversely, if you have one you never want to come off cold turkey, which is it?

(From what I've heard, coming off fentanyl addiction sounds especially hellish. It's just appearing where I live and I'm coming across fent addicts for the first time. From what they say, the high is intense but it doesn't hold as long as heroin so they're using 2-3 times as often and when they don't, they start clucking really fast, rather than the slow onset you get from smack...It sounds like a nightmare!)",1538680669.0

Well, as often is the case, I ran out of meds early. The kpin was first to go. I felt a bit nervous, but that was mainly my being nervous about the shit storm I thought I was heading into....but it never came!

About eleven years ago I had a decent (about a year) run with different pills. Mostly methadone and morphine.. occasionally codeine, oc, Vicodin, that sort of stuff. At the high point was doing about 20-30mg of 'done daily with the occasional 100mgs or so of morphine mixed in.

Since then I still dabble from time to time, but this past year I have been a dipping in a bit more again. Once a month I'll grab a dozen 'dones and and a dozen norcs (both 10mg). I generally try to keep my dosing limited to the weekends, but I'm not always successful at that. I don't do more than one of each at a time (if I do take some during the week it is usually half of each one), and to be honest my tolerance doesn't seem to grow much; these small doses have worked for me and continue to. Although I'm also one of those rarities that can catch a buzz from 50mg of tramadol.

I read through posts here, and I understand everyone is different, but it makes me question the true nature of my relationship with these substances.

(I also knew it was cut to an extent with something undetermined but inactive). I should add that I had taken a small (50mg) dose of ketamine the day before.

In total I snorted about 50mg of the powder. During a few hours I felt what I guess is a typical heroin high, nodding out a few times but always using my phone (I guess that means I didn’t OD). But instead of gently subsiding like I heard it should have, it seemed to have progressively intensified while the positive aspects disappeared. I was overwhelmed with intense nausea and vertigo every time I tried to move, until I had to throw up in a bucket at about midnight: this seems to have made things better but the symptoms didn’t subside. I managed to sleep for a few hours with some interruptions, but now, although I’m feeling better, I’m still feeling the nausea and vertigos. It’s 7:00 am now.

I’m thinking that maybe this is the result of the interaction between ketamine and heroin. Does somebody know what else it could be?

I know that ive completely ruined my life chasing this high, and nothing but negativity comes from it, but i'm still doing it. It's been almost 4 years since i got hooked. During one sober period i was so fucking determined to stop. I used to go by the thought that 'you have to want to quit more than you want to get high'... And i was so fucking sure that i reached that point. I was for sure that the life i was living was nothing but misery... & i turned it around and started putting the pieces back where they were supposed to be.

 Then life hit. 

One terrible mishap after another. I watched my cat slowly die, after the vets told me he would pull through. I was crushed, did everything i possibly could. I still kept clean. Had to pay extra money to keep my apartment, leaving me completely broke and hungry for weeks, still kept clean. Went through the worst heartbreak ive ever been through... Kept clean. Then one day the urge was just too much for me to handle. I broke. 

Started using again. Took me about 3 weeks to lose my apartment and move back to my moms, 500 miles away. Again i reached that point. That ""i want to get sober more than i want to get high"" thought. Went 3 weeks clean and then got hit with a court date back in the state i was living in. Worked things out with my dad and moved back in with him so i could get my court fines paid off & everything. I was so determined... Sooooo fucking determined that when i got back, i wouldnt go straight to my plug to get more dope. 

After the drive and sleeping it off, it took me about an hour to cave in and hit up the plug. Well.... Now 2 months later im still hooked. My dad kicked me out, i owe a good friend 350 dollars cause i tried to make a quick buck middlemanning and the buyer gave her fake hundreds. Once again, ive hit rock bottom.

Theres so much more to the story i can't fit in. I've done some things that make me want to kill myself just from the remorse it caused. I am such a fucking terrible person. I never was this total lowlife until i got hooked. I had everything going for me. I didnt know it at the time, but before i was hooked i was happy. Life was good. I would give everything to go back to the point where i was taking everything for granted. Yet i cant.

Im still stuck. Life has gotten far worse than i thought was even possible. Yet every... Fucking... Day... My first thought is how the fuck am i going to not be sick today? I don't feel like it's possible to get clean anymore because everytime i pick the pieces back up, i just go right back to the miserable lifestyle i was in.

I know it's all in my head. I know it's just urges that drive me. I know it's not near as glamorous as i lead myself to believe. So why? Why can't i escape? Why do i lead myself back to the path i was on? The answer to me is simple. My brain is wired to chase dopamine. No other thing in this world gives you dopamine like opiates do. Your sub-conscious doesnt care how bad it gets, it knows how much dopamine gets released when you get high.

Some people overcome this. How??? What the fuck? I dont get it? The only explanations i can come up with are that either they are only saying theyre clean to convince others to get clean or they arent nearly as predisposed to addiction as i am. Im sure both of those kinds of people exist in the world, but what about the people like me? 

I know i am strong. I have overcame things that normal people never could handle. Ive lived through things (before my addiction) that would have forced other people to opt the easy way out. Im a fucking survivor at heart. I know this to be a fact. Yet... I dont know if i can survive this hurdle. I don't know if i can get sober. I don't know if life is worth living. I thought i had it all figured out, time and time again... Yet i keep coming back. 

What the fuck am i supposed to do?


ps.

Ive been very vague about my life in this post just to save time, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

And i am drunk and hopeless right now. I might not even make sense, but im hoping the message i'm trying to convey does. Good luck guys. I hope you find happiness in this cruel, cruel world and i hope there really is a way to find a better life than this.",1538629242.0

I came to possess 3 vials of 2mg/mL of Lorazepam for IM or IV use (Ativan)
all the stuff about how to administer it results in clinical settings or nurse how to tutorials. I don't have luerlock or any catheters or saline flush or dilutant. What I do have readily is access to standard BD insulin 1cc 1/2 in syringes.

Again to spell out my question..
1. Will I be able to appropriately IM using 1cc 1/2 in syringe or will that result in a subcutaneous injection?
2. Instructions on the vial say to prep for injection by diluting the drug 1:1 but since my syringes are only 1cc its a bit tricky to have that much fluid. Is it ok to inject IM or IV ativan undiluted? Is it caustic? The fluid is slighty viscid when cooled.

Any other information that can warn/reduce my harm to self regarding IM/IV administration of Ativan will be appreciated also. 

Cheers 😊

My question is, if done under very sterile conditions could I successfully take care of this one with only a couple days worth of antibiotics? I understand it's dangerous to not finish an entire cycle of Antibiotics - so I'm wondering if I should even give her what we have left to begin with. (10 Cephalexin 500mg & 6 Bactrin DS 160mg).

I'm a snorter, i've never smoked or shot H. But essentially what happens these days is my heart rate drops dramatically compared to what it used to whenever I'd do H, i'm talking 40-50bpm here And this comes along with all the typical effects except for euphoria. I can nod, my pupils get pinned as fuck, i get itchy, the whole deal. all without euphoria. the strange thing is that this only happens with heroin. if I use oxy or another opioid, i get euphoria. what the fuck is going on here? did I manage to subconciously condition my body into not liking heroin anymore since I overdosed? also, i can confirm i'm using legitimate H. I've tried several different sources too, and I've tested every single one. all legit, no fent, no nothing. Just H. and yet here we are, me struggling to enjoy fucking heroin. 

I was thinking of trying to smoke it to see if it'd have a different effect but I'm not entirely sure what i wanna do yet. Does anybody here have any insight as to what might be going on here?

For the majority of the time, I simply took 10mg of Oxycodone 1-3 times a day depending on my pain.

&#x200B;

 I am a 21-year old male that weighs \~130lbs. Through my hospital stay and now out of the hospital, I have definitely felt the Oxycodone have less ""effects"" (although it still easily controls my pain). Overall, I've been taking the Oxycodone for maybe 2-3 weeks, daily. Dosage goes from 10 to 30mg per day, depending on how bad my pain was. On release from the hospital, they left me with a prescription for Oxycodone, listed as ""Oxycodone HCL 10mg Tab KVK-Tech"". I am to take these once every 6 hours at my own discretion. Since being discharged last Thursday (9/27), I have already used 6 up to today (10/3) - once a day, basically. I have 4 left.

&#x200B;

Basically, I'm worried about becoming addicted or dependent on Oxy. The doctors have told me that 10mg is a low dose and I should not worry about addiction, but I just want to check with experienced users to make sure. I've been experiencing a runny nose a lot of the time, which I know is a withdrawal symptom - especially since I haven't had a runny nose for years prior. Is this dose a danger for me (I know 10mg is tiny compared to what many others do), or should I just continue taking it as needed? Is it possible I'm technically addicted already, or am I just being paranoid?",1538615311.0

I know a great deal about designing analogs, reaction pathways and analysis techniques. I think my knowledge could be of service to drug users at risk. This is probably the wrong community, but the one I feel most connected to as an opiate user myself. 

If given a sample and description of expected contents, I could in most cases reasonably discern the most likely pathway of synth and thus the most likely containments, as well as cuts if I had reference standards. 

I am employed at a company and these could not work together, but with small startup cost (relative, I suppose) I could set up a small analysis facility. It would probably cost a few hundred thousand dollars for space, equipment, reagents and compliance/licensing. 

Is this of interest to the community? My aim would be to reduce the cost of getting high performance analysis from hundreds of dollars per sample to $10-30. If set up correctly as a non profit and maybe even with some outside funding, this could be doable given the cheap cost of running (solvents are cheap, the big stuff is the machines and the reference samples).

I've been pretty good about taking my daily buprenorphine but I've been getting a hankering for some heroin. Issue is, I've been out of active addiction for such a long time that I actually don't mind being alive so much these days, so was hoping someone could fill me in on how likely it is that any heroin I buy will have fentanyl in it. 

I saw a poster about fentanyl at my local CGL (which is something like a methadone clinic but for all substances), warning about the dangers, so I'm guessing it's definitely a thing here, and if that's the case I'll probably just stay away from heroin entirely. But I don't know maybe it's not as big of a problem here?

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I'm 100% gonna order some heroin off the darknet, I'm asking as much out of curiosity than any intent to use. My tolerance is so low that some codeine is enough for me these days, I just took just under 200mg and I'm feeling pretty good. Not nodding out, but nice, y'know, so heroin would probably be a bit much. Cheap tho.

Pills are way too expensive imo, so I was wondering if you could mix heroin with a filler to more accurately dose. Cap it, and take it orally. 

How much should I fill in the caps? 

Would it work?

I have a question regarding kratom use as a mode for getting clean. Through my research i have found that there are quite a few strains if kratom that each come with different effects and are used for different things. My question is, which strain of kratom is best for getting off heroin dependence and why is that strain the best. Which strain contains the most opiate alkaloids? And finally, what is the best dosage for that strain in order to curb withdrawals entirely in an individual with a high tolerance (using a bun of decent- strong H per day for 3 years and previously 5-10 oxycodone 30s for 8 years, 1 year overlap using blues and h together then strictly H alone). Thank you so much to anyone who answers, i appreciate your help very much. I have subs but i can't begin to list all the reasons i hate using them and i really really want to use kratom instead so please refrain from telling me to use subs because I'll dismiss it from the start, I'm strictly here for kratom advice, nothing more nothing less. Thank you so much again, in advance. God bless you all and i wish health and happiness to you all, members of the best subreddit going.

(TLDR, not a cotton shot, used a fresh q-tip to mix up, clean rig, etc🙄)

I ran to the bathroom and started projectile vomiting all over everything. My whole body felt hot and I started sweating uncontrollably. I threw up until there was nothing left and bile started coming up. I tried to lay down but couldn’t sleep, my body kept alternating between horrible sweats and chills. 

I got up to throw up again and decided to mix up another shot. I was shaking and sweating so badly that every time I got a register I fell out of the vein. I kept trying over and over again, finally got my hands steady and dry enough to push in the shot. 

I went to lay down in my room, brought a bucket because I was still throwing up. It didn’t help right away, but eventually the shot got me to the point where I could just fall asleep. I felt better after sleeping for a few hours.

I have over a year clean, again.  my tracks are just little white scars at this point, not noticeable.  I look kind of crazy \[tattoos and purple hair\] but I don't feel like I scream ""junkie"" in this moment.

I haven't been approached about drugs AT ALL since I got here.  not even once.  which is strange because this is a major metropolitan area and I'm all over it all the time and use public transit.

but TODAY:  it finally happened.  not once, not twice, but **three** times.

**first:**  some homeless guy sat down at the bus stop with me and just started talking about his heroin use out of nowhere, unprovoked.  nice guy, though.

**second:** some guy in the city park was actually advertising.  which like never happens here.  he hit me with a ""got clear and black"" as I was walking past.

**and third:** some guy I saw outside the needle exchange this morning ran into me at the train station, like 8 hours later on the other side of town, and chatted me up for a cigarette and offered to help me score.

like what the fuck?  nothing nothing and nothing for five months and then out of the blue it's like a triple whammy in one day.  like is this a sign that it's my time again?  why today?  I really don't know.  just wanted to talk about it.  I'm conflicted because I've been wanting to get high again really bad, but I also let all three opportunities go.

I've been subscribed to this sub for a little while, and I was doing dope when I first started lurking on here. I was doing opiates for 10 years before I did that shit. The pills weren't doing it for me anymore, plus dope was cheaper, blah blah blah same old story.

Anyway, I went in the hospital after being on it for almost 2 years, detoxed and got on some anxiety medication, then came home and relapsed. Went back in the hospital, got my meds changed up, and now I'm home again. I'm done with the withdrawals, feeling pretty decent, just still having some cravings. But I'm trying my best to resist because that shit was destroying my life and I want to rebuild and recover.

One of my problems is that I'm only about 2 weeks sober and I'm scared of relapsing. I know it's totally my choice and all, but it's just scary to think about going back to that. I'm about to get into a Suboxone clinic, but the issue with that is that they won't take a patient unless they have opiates in their system, so I'm worried about what to do.

I have to take some kind of opiate to get into the clinic, but I don't want to take anything. Would it count as a relapse to take something one time just to get into the clinic?? I'm really trying here, I'm just stuck in a hard spot. Any advice guys? Thanks for reading.",1538526483.0

I didn't ""start"" with anything else because my initial ambition was to end my life (I figured ODing was the best way to go). I bought 10 bags off the original Silk Road and got them in the mail (strangely, the guy I got them from was later part of the case built against the guy who ran the site). I snorted half a bag before I decided to ""pull the trigger"" and within 5 minutes knew that life wasn't \*nearly\* as bad as I thought and I wouldn't have to die (so I guess I have heroin to thank for saving my life).

But later I combined all the bags thinking I would make up some big solution that I could take bits from, I accidentally took too much MDMA (also from SR) and needed to ""calm down"". I was extremely spun out on MDMA so I took probably 6-7 bags worth of heroin and ""shot up"" (I had 0 experience shooting up at this time, so I probably didn't even hit a vein). Still, the only thing that happened was I puked a lot. I didn't pass out or anything.

Since then, I have never overdosed or come even close despite intentionally trying several times since, using dope that someone else ODed on, quitting and then coming back, etc. I live in California and soon after the silk road I started copping it off the streets of SF and SD, so with the exception of the stuff I got off the silk road, everything is tar if that makes a difference.

&#x200B;

I've read since then that almost everyone who ODs is actually taking Xanax or Alcohol along with their heroin but it seems like plenty of people OD ""normally"".  For those who have ODed - will I be able to feel it coming or will I just pass out immediately? Has anyone else been ""congenitally"" incapable of ODing?

No that isn't the lighting btw it is definitely bright purple. 

So neither of my plugs were responding today. Most likely because it's a blizzard up here in Canada currently. But I didn't feel like taking my usual daily dose of methadone and just wanted some opiate buzz whether it was heroin or fent. 

Proceeded to go downtown and walked by the homeless shelter because there is a bridge and under the overpass sometimes guys hang out to get picked up for construction job for cash jobs. But also corner boys hang out occasionally though in my city there isnt much of an open air market anywhere at all. Asked a few people and there was weed, benzo presses, crack and coke but no down ( I usually find down can be the hardest to find and acquire). 

Next I went by city hall because people sometimes deal around there but also only tek/meth. This is where I remembered I have been to the safe injection site once or twice before. So I headed over there and there was a group of people sitting down on the stairs at the church or like community center across from it that looked sort of rough. 

I asked the first girl I saw that looked probably the roughest out of the guys and girls in the group. Immediately ahead said she had some but I would have to trust her to go around the corner with a plug that was on the other side of the street. At this point I was obviously a little hesitant because I never let the money walk with anyone or trust anyone in this kind of circumstance on the street because I have been burnt for a few hundred a couple times for doing this. So I just said to her hey I will trust you but I'm only going to do 50 dollars not the 100 I originally stated which she was cool with and understood. I also gave her 60 throwing her 10$ because I could tell she had a rough life on the streets and probabaly needed it alot more then me and was helping me out. Also I could afford to get burned for 60$ if it happened. I also threw her a hoot to have on some foil as a measure of appreciation since she got it instantly and it was a fat couple bags. Was definitely the barney the dinosaur purple fent that is going around but thankfully for fent this stuff actually has reasonably long legs and doesnt only last an hour or two which is what makes fent so unappealing.",1538520037.0

It is pretty consistent which I like, almost the same thing every time or close, but its also the only opiate I can get and it's take a fucking taking a toll on my nasal cavities!!

The problem is because the bags are huge and I've grown a tolerance, 4-5 bags is equal to like 10 thirties in powder probably, and that's what I am at now (at first I was only doing 2 bags a day).  I try as hard as I can to do without nasal spray, so my nose is ALWAYS clogged and I can barely sniff it up my nose, its a mess and its annoying but its life as an addict I guess.   Up until a week ago my nose would be able to be blown out completely to the point where the mornings were the best sniff bc it went right up and by night it would be fully clogged but now its always clogged.  From the second week and on, there's been various nights with blowing out blood.  Since a few days ago it is now not clearing up enough to snort easily in the morning, and my nose is basically clogged the entire day.  I shined my phone light up there today for the first time and it is all scabbed and yellow and weird looking, I hope its not infected.  One side is worse than the other but both sides are fucked up.  Needless to say I am still trying to get it up there because I have bags left.  This shit DEF cant be smoked and I don't shoot so that out of the question, so are there any other ways to take it?
