A lot of bickering, name calling, accusations, alt accounts, and just general bullshit. I'm tired of this shit, and I know the other mods are too. If you have a problem with someone, block them in your preferences. If someone is harassing you report their messages, and send a PM to /r/reddit.com and explain you are being harassed. The mod's here can only do so much (meaning very little) if you are being harassed or doxxed, that is something the admins have to deal with.

All of this drama and infighting has taken the focus of what this sub is here for, and that is to provide harm reduction and support. This sub hasn't seemed all that supportive lately and honestly that makes me sad. I volunteer my time to mod here, as well as the other mods, and we do it because we love this sub, and want to make sure it's here to help people. But I've personally had to devote a ton of time lately to all this drama, and so have the other mods. So please everyone, can we all act like the adults we are and stop with the trolling and the harassing and the general dumb shit, and bring the focus of this sub back to harm reduction and support? Upvote positive content, downvote negative content, and report posts that break the rules. If your having a problem please send us a modmail and we will do our best to help you.

Anyway since October one of my previous on point dboys has had some crazy ""dope"" off and on. This stuff has a real weird smell, it's greyish white and doesn't taste like dope at all. The feeling it gives you is EXTREMELY unpleasant. The first time I did it I was seconds away from calling 911 because I thought I was dying. The only way I can explain it is it feels like ketamine/synthetic canabanoid/some disassociative but not it a good way. Like it puts you in this awful head space and feels nothing like an opiate. My heart started racing and I thought I was gonna die. I think that part may have been my anxiety cause I knew I just took some crazy chemical and had no idea how long it was gonna last or if it was gonna get worse. Luckily it only last about 45 minutes. And it didn't touch my dope sickness at all.

Trying to get a clue as to what it was I looked to see if my pupils dilated or constricted or if they got all red. None of that happened. I've talked to a few other of his customers and they said it did it to them too. Like it gave them massive social anxiety and they just felt all weird. 

I have no clue how this guy has been selling this shit for almost three months. Who keeps coming back for it? 

Anyway, any of you guys had anything like this?",1514621935.0

Sure, someone might power through it and become a minority in doing so, but when the sickness becomes too overbearing and you are lying in your own sweat, vomit, tears and shit you finally feel well enough to maybe eat and drink something from your damp bed sheets; you will only get the strength back to go out and cop again.  Seriously.  My time in Boston and again on New Year's '11, '12, '13, '14 and '15.  

I've been addicted to opiates since 2010 and have been an addict since 2001.  I'm 32 now and jobless living with my rents hoping to see 2018.  Sure, I've been lucky enough to find myself in a clinic since 2015 with a stint of relapses on occasion and I feel as if I'm the living dead.  I'm past due for my expiration date. I've been spoon fed 
pharmaceuticals from antidepressants to antipsychotics and won't take it unless it's got a black label notice.  Quacks; being in and out of rehabs, jail, and mental facilities I finally find some solace in being ok with myself knowing I should have been dead a long time ago.  

May god rest her soul, but seeing my friends sister dead in a coffin laying there peaceful in her eternal slumber made my bones envious more so than upset.  Knowing if you are reading this now then you are at least able to know that you are breathing, and feeling ok enough to think that being alive isn't fun unless you are being put on some kind of narcotic.  I am more than jaded and paranoid looking over my shoulder since I can remember and it's finally to the point that even drugs don't even give me a form of escape that I yearn for.  

I've tried suicide more times than I can count and a 10 bag shot of fire dope can't cut through my 100mg methadone daily dose to black me out of this hell we call life.  I know in death there is where we find true peace and love.  The love here is temporary and fleeting.  It's uncontrollable and unpredictable.  I know this is sounding morbid and dark, but is it where we fret and shy away from the bad things we call horrors just the only thing that we all will face eventually.  

I've been giving a ""nickel ride"" in 2015 around the time of Freddie Grey's death. Put handcuffs on your wrists as tight as you can behind your back and sit in a squatting position for 2-3 hours and then you can feel the torture I've been through.  I've been legally kidnapped and beaten by the people swore to protect us, but because I use a substance deemed illegal by sheltered minds, I deserve being pulled out of my running car, by plain clothed ""officers"" not knowing if they really are the ""good guys' and manhandled until I rat on my friends whereabouts.  Of course I wasn't going to put him through what I've been through and so without drugs or reason they are allowed to just kidnap you because they have this thing called ""probable cause""...  Those are just a couple of injustices everyone on this board may and can face in the U.S. or Philadelphia.  (Fuck philly it's overrated and too hot for this shit)

I hope all of you have a great New Years and hope your resolutions are to find a middle ground for your habits and get into a maintenance program or long term treatment facility, because cold turkey and self abstinence will NOT work.  I wish you luck, but don't kid yourself.  Here's to a New Year and new beginnings.  Here is too the loved ones and people we know who died from their battles with opiate addiction and too the boys in blue who get hard ons putting people like you and I though hell to give themselves a sense of accomplishment.

Actually, down to 1.5 mg subs/day (I know some people say that's not clean, but I don't get high, which in my book, that's what sober means and it's a huge fucking improvement).

My question is this: I see all these happy people. They're getting married, going on vacations, having kids, spending time with family, doing whatever normal life shit that's fulfilling. And I try to imagine myself being in those situations. I could have all of that. But honestly, all I can think about is how meaningless it would all feel without dope. Like I'm envisioning standing next to the love of my life (assuming I can even still feel that shit) on a perfect day, and it feels empty. And in that imaginary moment, all I can think about is how the only thing that would make this moment feel magical is dope. I'm seriously fucking terrified this is how I'll always feel from now on. Does pleasure from normal life ever come back? And how long does it take? Is this the pink cloud shit people talk about? Is that common after 7 months of abstinence?

Should I do a CWE?,"I've seen a LOT of different information on the internet from people saying to stay under 1000mg to websites saying usually single doses under 7000mg aren't toxic... Although I have found practically nothing that described a single dose limit except for FDA guidelines, so I am curious what y'all consider a ""safe"" SINGLE dosage of acetaminophen for you? 

I've ALWAYS stayed under the 3,000 mg limit, but have never once stayed under the 1,000 mg single dose limit (Usually I'll go 1600mg APAP in one dose. Maybe twice a week) 

So do you think I'm doing any damage to my liver? What is YOUR limit? 

Now I read from a chart called ""Recommendation For Referral To Emergency Department (ED)"" that says Acute, Single, Unintentional Ingestion of Acetaminophen"" which says ""Refer to ED if estimated acute ingestion is: Unknown OR at least 10 grams or 200 mg/kg"" 

Link for that is here: https://www.uspharmacist.com/article/acetaminophen-toxicity-what-pharmacists-need-to-know

From the above quote, would you assume that a single, one time dose on a healthy individual is not usually a cause for emergency unless it is 10 g or 200mg/kg? That would seem like a LOT. 

Is it possible that one time use of a high dose (4g and up) is not as dangerous as the accumulative effects of 4g's every day? ",1514579757.0

I have an ok family, few close friends and a woman I love dearly. 

The reason why I‚Äôm telling all this is that I‚Äôd like yall to know that I‚Äôm not depressed, suicidal or whatever it is that makes people wanna do heroin but ever since my father was diagnosed with ALS, I lost faith in God and started hurting people that I care about the most, especially my mother and my future fiancee. Then I started smoking cannabis on weekends because a friend of mine said it would help me relax but all it ever did for me was giving me anxiety and shitty thoughts even tho I kinda liked the high. 

A few days ago I went to this barber and I kinda just let it all out and told him about my life for some reason. Guess I just had to vent or whatever and he was like I know a guy who has what you need but you gotta think long and hard if you really wanna do it or not. I asked what could it possibly mean and he was like ‚Äúyou ever done h?‚Äù I said i ll think about it and looked it up online and all I ever got was prejudiced websites telling people only about the risks and side effects and saying shit like ‚Äúnot even once‚Äù or whatever so I wanted to ask about unprejudiced opinions about this substance to people who actively do it on the regular and could give me the best advice.

So in all seriousness, is it ok to do it a couple of times to.. let s say go on a spiritual journey and find peace even for a couple of days?

I really really just wanna get away for a while.

Had major shoulder surgery, and even though they gave me hydros and percs that didn‚Äôt do shit, I used it as my reasoning for using. Of course it also helped with the mundaneness (that a word? Fuck it) of being in grad school and hours of PowerPoints, studying, etc. 

But I digress. Fuck it. I‚Äôm ready to be clean. I tapered to where 1.5 lasted basically 10 days over holidays, waking up to wet dreams and all that shit but still managed to be normal during that time. I‚Äôm going in two days to die for hopefully only 3-5 days of hell. Part of me wants to barely have anything, to embrace the pain and withdrawals as punishment. But there‚Äôs the other side of me that‚Äôs a little bitch, and wants it to be as smooth as possible to ensure I stick to the plan. 

My question for you guys- I‚Äôm going to get bars, herb, and I already have two halves of sub for when I failed earlier. Is this going to be enough you think? My bro says to not worry about subs, for it‚Äôs going to prolong the suck a bit, and the offchance I get stuck on those. I don‚Äôt want to be dependent on shit anymore, and just become a stoner again. How many totem poles should I get? I‚Äôll prob get some soft just for shits too, to give me something to look forward to? 

I plan to have fun today, I should‚Äôve just jumped off yesterday after the taper I basically did but fuck it. I still have some at home that I don‚Äôt want to just throw out or give away. I worked for that shit dammit! Lol

I plan to also use this as a diary of sorts. I 100% am ready, and if this can help one other person who is in the same boat I am then that‚Äôs worth it to me, fuck you haters! 

So TLDR- definitely herb and nerves will be utilized. Yay or nay to subs? I have gotten sick off of them prior to my habit so I doubt I‚Äôll continue to use them, but could that be an issue? Has it been for anyone?

**Why do you think most people OD?** By 'why' I mean what is the common scenario - is it usually overestimating tolerance after a clean period? Accidentally buying fakes cut with fentanyl? Just the progression of addiction and ever higher tolerance? What else?

I'm especially curious about fentanyl - do people mostly do fentanyl on purpose or by accident? I was talking to an ER nurse in Portland last night and she didn't think fentanyl fakes were that big a deal...her patients just OD because they buy fent to save money and then just take more and more until they end up in the ER.

Got clean over 30 days then started chipping for a couple more months.  As we all know how that goes it started getting out of hand where I was using more days than not.

Anyways I am clean again now for 25 days today.  Long story short I've found 15 oxy 10/325s.  40-50mg used to hit the spot when I was using daily.  So I'm sure 20-30mg would work now.

Question is what kind of price am I going to pay for this WD-wise.  Let's say I use 20-30mg twice a day for 2.5 days.  Are my withdrawals back at square 1?  Bad hangover for a couple days?

Sidenote:  Believe me I know the dangers of relapse but all my sources are gone at this point.  This just happened to be a lucky find (that's why they're free).  So this will really be a one time deal.",1514730550.0

- Started using Oxy about 2.5 years ago. 20mg would have me in heaven.
- Would go weeks or months between uses at first. 
- Over time this progressed to 4-5 day binges once a month, every month. The reason I didn't use more is because I'm out of the UK a lot and have no access then.
- 20mg doesn't do anything for me now, even with weeks off. 40mg is what I need to feel good but there are many days I've taken 120mg in a day. 
- I don't know if I've ever been physically addicted. I've felt absolutely terrible at the end of binges but not sure if that's just from binging on oxy and coke. That said, a couple of days after binges I've felt terrible, then taken an Oxy and magically felt completely better. so it seems likely I was in withdrawal. 
- I think about Oxy every day, for multiple hours every day. I'm about 70 days clean at the moment. My thoughts are still, 'Maybe if I just go back to using once a month I can get the lovely effects without the downsides'.
- Work couldn't be going better, have a good marriage and am in great physical shape. 
- I visit this sub every day. Almost salivate when I see some of the pill porn.

I should never use opiates again, right?",1514721199.0

been getting a bunch of bullshit lately. it sucks. i got beat for 80 fuckin dollars tonight while i was sick, ended up with a dub of very low quality tar. some sad shit. i'm not really doing anything special tomorrow night but i wanna have a nice time w my girl and that's not gonna be so easy if i'm as sick as i was earlier today. i managed to save about 4 puffs of this garbage for the morning, but that won't hold me for long. i should be able to get ripped off and end up with a miniscule amount of dope that can sort of keep me off sick for a few hours tomorrow. i really don't see myself not getting fucked in the ass by the universe like usual tho. 

so, i'd like to try to get a little bit high tomorrow night. i have a few T3's laying around. think that's my best chance at getting a little buzz on tbh. so, 330mg codeine phosphate, approx. equivalent to 45mg morphine (possibly as much as 75mg actually tho? i'm seeing diff info). i have ~100mg dxm, bunch of dph, and two boxes of lope. i've never used dxm for potentiation. is it actually worth bothering? i'll prob skip the dph, makes me too drowsy. i do also have a few grams of some red vein kratom as well. even if i get some dope, i'll need all the help i can get.

*****************************************************
so i guess my questions are...

any problems with kratom + codeine? i'm hoping the combo of the two super light highs might produce one mild high. god i'm desperate lmao.


i'm a heroin addict. am i gonna feel this shit at all? thing is, my tolerance really isn't that high rn. the tar i've been getting is such low quality, i might make a G last me 2 days or more, but there's no way there's more than like 50mg of any actual dope in there. i swear. so if i've been dosing like 10mg diamorphine at a time and getting some relief, maybe even a little buzz, maybe 330mg codeine will get me somewhere.

is there any place for the lope here? will the effects ""stack"", will it block the effects, will it do nothing at all? 

boofing codeine is a dumb idea, right? i've never boofed anything but i'd totally start now if it was worth it. 

thanks for reading lmao, hopefully i can actually get a slight buzz going tomorrow night, we'll see.",1514715976.0

7n7ezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7n7ezi/my_story/,33,https://redd.it/7n7ezi,nopulseoflife77,My story...,"It started when I was 18. I grew up with a very liberal but very anti drug family. The first hard drug I ever tried was ecstasy. It was amazing and I thought what else is everyone lying to me about. I felt like drugs were keys to doors to feelings and thoughts that you can‚Äôt experience any other way and I wanted to try and experience everything. Coke was the next thing I tried and I loved it. But my mom found out and put me into rehab. 

When I got out I went down to FL to live with my dad and immediately went looking for coke. I found it and then one day the guy I was getting it from said that he couldn‚Äôt get anymore blow that day but asked me would I like to try some oxys, they were cheaper and felt amazing, I was in love . That got me on opiates. Back then in FL they still had the pill mills so my guy set me up with a fake MRI and script history. I went to two mills and each one wrote me 250 oxy 30s. It got really bad when I would run out of my scripts before I could get more the next month. Then one day they passed a law that everyone had to check all the patients history‚Äôs and I was cut off. 

So I decided to leave and move in with my sister in Baltimore. That‚Äôs when I was introduced to heroin. If you have ever seen The Wire then you know what my life was like in Baltimore. That show is 100% accurate. This whole time I am not shooting up just sniffing my dope which I think saved me. That lasted 2 years and then my sister found out and kicked me out. 

I got lucky and got offered a job out west at a ski resort.  A friend let me crash on his couch and and detox. Then I moved out west. I couldn‚Äôt find  coke or heroin out there so I started using mushrooms, LSD and DMT. I wasn‚Äôt using psychedelics to expand my consciousness, I was using them to get fucked up as much as could. I took so many shrooms one night that I broke my ankle and didn‚Äôt even feel it till I got to the hospital over an hour away. The paramedics were in shock how calm I was. I then got a connect in CA and started moving blow back and forth making a good amount of money. I must have stepped on the wrong toes because I only made a few trips before I got robbed at gunpoint. 

I decided to cut my losses and moved to Key West where I started using lots of coke again. I only lived in the Keys for a few months before my mom offered me a job in her company as a sales rep in AL. I got completely clean. I started exercising and really started making the right choices.  I met the love of my life and prepared to ask her to marry me. With in a couple months my girl dumped me, my grandmother died and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. 

It was just too much and so I started using heroin again and I quickly turned from snorting to shooting. Didn‚Äôt take long for my mom to find out and fire me. So that‚Äôs my story, I am going into rehab next week and hopefully I finally get my addiction under control. But for the first time In my life I don‚Äôt have any hope. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll make it and I don‚Äôt care if I do. Sorry to end on such a depressing note. I hope someone reads this and decides not to go down this awful path. ",1514707625.0

[(https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7n3xr2/everett_wa_needle_cleanup_behind_a_home_depot/drzew10/?context=10000)]

**I'm giving you all fair warning now, it's a bit of a wall of text, so if you don't like reading - turn around now.**

Sorry for the wall of text - you don't need to read any of this if you don't want. It was cathartic just to be able to type it all out.

I speak from experience and one of the big problems I've had is the fact that drug use (especially harder drugs like heroin or meth) is (or seems to be) looked down upon. People tell you ""Why don't you just quit?"" (can't count how many times I've heard that). You feel (or at least I do) so guilty about your choice to use drugs and you feel afraid to tell people because of what you think they might say or that they won't understand.

I will say, the one time I went to detox, I felt very welcomed and understood. None of the nurses seemed to be judging me, they all seemed to want the best for me (genuinely). A lot of the nurses I talked to had kids or loved ones who battled with or were still battling with addiction and it gave them an inside look at what it's like. I think that really helps, parents with kids who battle addiction I think is the closest you can get to experiencing withdrawal without actually going through it. I remember when I was trying to quit cold turkey one time at my Dad's house and he came into my room on day 2 and he was beside himself... he kept telling me he just wished he could take all the pain away from me and let him take the burden. I know he would if he could too... that's just my Dad. I love him to death.

So many times when I'm talking to people about addiction, specifically opiate (heroin) addiction, they bring up ""just quitting"". I've always wished so badly that I could give them a day of what I feel like on day 2 or 3 of intense withdrawal. I've never experienced anything like it, it's hell on earth. People can try and compare it to the flu x 10 or whatever, but unless you've FELT it.... it just isn't the same. I would take any flu over bad heroin withdrawal.

I will say, in detox the process was the most comfortable I've ever been when detoxing. I was able to eat and even sleep due to the meds they were giving me. I've been wanting to go back because I need to give it another try... lest I end up dead from complications from IV use, broke and homeless, or worse. I'm just nervous, I know this is a totally paranoid thought, but coming back to detox I'd feel like a failure in their eyes. Like they tried their best with me once and I fucked it up.  I know this is irrational because I knew guys in there that were on their 10th+ times.

I don't think it helps that I'm already social anxious to begin with, so when you couple that with heroin use... well, it's not pretty. I'm already super high strung and up in my head about a lot of things. I always have been. Anxiety and depression run in my mom's family and I'm sure I've got a bit of that.

Then, once detox is over, I feel great for a week or two while the drugs slowly come out of my system and then it's back to boredom, restless legs, inability to get any good sleep. Boredom mainly. I've been using for so long, it's all I find fun anymore. When I was a kid I used to play PC games religiously (it was an addiction of it's own, no doubt) but when I try to go back to them when I'm sober, the interest just isn't there.

I'm not sure what the answer is for me or others, but I hope someone finds some kind of miracle cure. Wishful thinking, I know. I'll keep thinking of ways to help and if I ever get clean, I want to make it a mission in life to help other addicts. I know the pain all too well and if I could help just one other addict get and stay clean, it would make me so immensely happy.  In order to do any of that, I need to get clean first myself, I know this.  I'm just not sure when or how it will happen.  I've only been to detox once and after that I went to a rehab, which I promptly left after 4 or 5 days.  It just didn't feel like it was for me.  I'm shy by nature and that environment doesn't benefit people who are shy or timid. 

I'm not a bad person, I'm really not... I've done things I'm not proud of, but I still try my best to make the world a better place - even while in the throes of addiction.  I do believe I still have a moral compass and it leads to me getting scammed, ripped off, betrayed by so called friends.  Even strangers I see that are struggling, maybe sick, I've broken them off pieces in the past expecting nothing in return... just because I know that feeling all too well.  Granted, this isn't something I do all the time and I have to have extra, but still.  How many other junkies can say the same?  I tend to believe 99.9% of addicts are only out for themselves but there are the rare few I've run into that surprise me.  For how long, I'm not sure.  But that's why I want to get clean - if I was clean and had my desire under control, I think I could help these people.  I'm sure they've had much worse lives than I have and if I can be a friend to them without the constant idea of heroin lingering in both of our brains, I think I could help.  Obviously, this is much further down the road, if ever.  Just wishful thinking on my part.

Try not to tear me apart too much - I know some of these ideas are a bit loony and I'll get shit about more than a few things.  I guess I just wanted to say exactly what's on my mind.",1514705760.0

Are you guys operating under the idea that less water = hit you harder? Unfortunately, when you push it in, it's diluted in liters of blood so that can't be true other than placebo (which can be strong to be fair.

Perhaps under the idea that the less in the rig, the less likely you are to miss some of the shot? Fair enough, but the reason I use as much water as possible for how many shots i want to do is so that even if I miss a little bit, it won't be much due to dilution as well as adding all that water makes it MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ABSCESS!!

Anyway, I just wanted to share my 0.02c regarding this issue in the name of Harm Reduction. Using more water to get to 80-100 units instead of 20-40 won't kill your buzz, but it'll make life a lot easier on your veins. Please share your thoughts.",1514693406.0

Ive done this once before without issue, im wondering other than the risk of infection from tap water and non sterile fitering, if the binders and fillers in the pill can still harm my lungs and heart etc? I know never to IV pills without micron filtering, but is subq safer?

I believe since it isnt directly into a vein, that the drug is absorbed and the filler powders get left behind. Is that right? And if so what happens to that material? Does it get broken down or absorbed?

Coming off a 200mg/day or more habit, oxy.

Soooo.....couple questions. What dosage of kpins? I have 1mg pills, plenty of them. Moderate tolerance. Was thinking 2mg every morning? Gonna be 2mg Xanax for sleep.

And if I can mask the physical symptoms of withdrawal, will that eliminate the stress that it puts on your heart?

I've gone through many times, but not at this heavy a dosage. And trying to be more calculated this time. Last dose was 10am this morning, and I'll be dry at LEAST 2 weeks til refill.

Thanks all!

Thank you","The title pretty much says it all. I have a Thc/Cbd ""oil"" vape pen, the kind with a disposable cartridge and rechargeable battery. An actual pen not those big ass vapes people get at vape shops or anything like that. I can post photos if necessary.  I want to refine black/BTH and then mix it in a cartridge or put it in an empty cartridge and smoke it out of the pen. 

Is it possible for someone to do this? I'm guessing in order to do so you'd have to melt it down and/or refine it to some degree. Which is cool because that'd be removing some of the impurities out and create a more potent substance. To melt it down Would it be similar to prepping a shot before shooting up? (I don't use needles and never have so I'm not too familiar with this)

Has anyone tried this before?


Some other questions If this is possible:
-So once it's melted down/refined and ready to be put in the cartridge would I need to mix it with the Thc/Cbd oil for it to properly work and smoke correctly? Or can it be a empty cartridge?

-is there any reason this shouldn't be done? 

I feel like it could be a good idea if you're a smoker considering you're melting it down and refining it getting a lot of the impurities removed so It could be a more potent substance and more discreet to smoke. And if mixed with the Thc/Cbd oil could be a hell of a combination lol

Would it be wasting any product or ineffective to go this route? If so, why/how?

If anyone has done this, has experience doing this, or other knowledge related to the subject please let us know your thoughts, experiences, instructions, etc please.

I‚Äôve tried a forum search on this topic but have not found anything relevant - sorry if this is asked often!

I‚Äôm sitting on a long term, prescribed dose of 4mg of oral bupe (subutex) p/d as part of a substitution therapy scheme. While this has declined from 16mg p/d and I am shooting for 0, you might understand why I am reluctant to rush a 4-0 taper prior to leaving!

Does anybody else here have experience with travelling internationally - ideally into Columbia or other areas of South Central America - with a legal bupe prescription?

It‚Äôs an oddly specific question to google, but if anyone knows of any info sites out there that cover the rules for different counties or something like that, that would also be awesome.

I have no one else to spill it to so figured id spill it here. A little over a week ago I had over 8 months of sobriety under my belt. Everything was great and being sober and away from the madness was amazing. I don't know why I slipped up there was no reason to do so, but I did and unfortunately addiction won me over once again. So I picked up a couple packs and a few more packs as the week went on I was still flying under the radar. As Friday came around I decided might as well get some coke and go all out since ive already lost all that I worked for the past 8 months. So between coke and h, I had and up and down weekend, no harm done. Christmas came around coke is gone but still doing h. I got my hands on some xans. Christmas night I was feeling great had some xans in me and was going to pick up some more h with an old ""friend"". while picking up the h the dealer had some crack so I said fuck it lets get that rolling as well. between the h, xans and crack I was on top of the world and bound to fall off. I made it home that night. and last thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital with my family around me in tears explaining to me that without my sister finding me at 4 in the morning gargling in my own vomit I wouldn't be alive.....Just like that 8 months clean and sober and within a week addiction almost took my life. Now sitting here typing this a few days later I'm still using just h. my family looks at me like I'm an alien and I cant just see the disgust in their eyes. I'm alone and feel worse than I ever have in my life. But I guess I can be thankful I'm still alive... Thanks for listening.

I have real chronic pain. I was in pain management. I left on my own .. just felt it was hurting more than helping me. My oxycodone dose worked it‚Äôs way up to about 360MG daily. I just felt sick all the time. I usually took 90mg 4x daily. I decided to go the sub route to get off and hoping that I would get some pain relief from the sub. To my surprise it actually has been working well. I am RX‚Äôd 16 mg daily. I have never taken more than 6mg at one time and never more than 12mg in a day. I took my last Oxy on 10/28/17 after being on opiates for 8 years. I am going to start cutting the sub down. I figure the quicker I can get off , the better. 

So now that you have the background ... I want that warm feeling .. that oxy heaven feeling. I know I am doing well and I know it‚Äôs dumb .. but if I break down how would it work. I want to be able to take some oxy in between some sub doses. Reduce it a little , take some oxy for 1/2 a day and go back to the sub. I do not want to risk any precipitated WD so there is that. I‚Äôm not gonna lie .. I have real pain .. but you and I know that‚Äôs not why I want the oxy. Any suggestions?

And opiates. Gonna smoke 2 cigarettes at midnight to ring in the new year, should be right at the peak of the hydro by then. Gonna stop using cigs at all 2018. Of all the drugs to start using at 25, cigarettes are the most stupid. You start smoking young, not a quarter of the way through your life. Gonna focus on getting a new job this upcoming year. I hate where I‚Äôm at with my current one. I‚Äôm a cashier/server at a burger place. Really nice place, cool company that runs it and cool coworkers and it‚Äôs actually a really fun job that I like a lot, I just hate that I feel stuck in it. My social anxiety and mood swings (probably undiagnosed bipolar disorder, we‚Äôll find out on Friday for sure) prohibit me from becoming a bartender let alone a manager which I would like to do.

Some days are great though and I love everyone who comes through the door but I‚Äôm gonna be 25 next month and I have a college degree that‚Äôs gonna be a year old come summer in something I don‚Äôt even want to do anymore. I live at home with my parents and hardly have any ‚Äòreal ‚Äô bills (weird complaint I know) or responsibilities. I have almost no friends outside of work save one and she‚Äôs really the only person I hang out with outside of work but of course I‚Äôve gone and fallen head over heals hopelessly, helplessly and haplessly in love with her.  She was the first person in forever who had gone out of her way to be my friend back in a time when I had no business having friends cause I was such an angry, pissed off jerk. She‚Äôs beautiful and sweet and lovely and good hearted and likes me and wants to spend time with me (baffles my mind that she does but lol) and is everything I want in a woman. I‚Äôve known her for years; but she‚Äôs married. Happily. With a kid. And he‚Äôs good for her.  (despite the occasional difficulties she‚Äôll tell me about). I can never have her. And fantasizing about calling her mine involves wishing something terrible to happen to him or their relationship which I would never want to see and so makes me a bad person for wanting her. Im stuck in a rut and I don‚Äôt know how to move on with my life. I love her. If I get a new job we won‚Äôt be able to bae as close as we are now. I feel stuck. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs driving me insane lately. I‚Äôve been experimenting with drugs and shit, especially opiates and I‚Äôm running steroids all because I can‚Äôt cope with where I‚Äôm at right now. I don‚Äôt love myself at all and so I don‚Äôt see myself with a future or anything. The funny thing is that despite that, i steadfastly believe in god and that he is good, that he is love. That he is all powerful, infinite and eternal.  But I don‚Äôt know where he is in all this. I don‚Äôt know what his divine plan is for me. I have a loving family who care about me and pray for me. They do everything in their power to help me but I go nowhere and I feel like I‚Äôm failing them, disappointing them.  Tonight I just want to feel good and forget about all of that. I don‚Äôt know that 50mg is gonna do very much though. My tolerance has gone up some which sucks.

My friend and I were only able to pull together about $25 to get right to enjoy new years with our respective friends and families. He told me to come get him and we drove to the area to meet his dude. His dude called and told us he left to re-up and we missed him by 20 minutes. After waiting over an hour for him to come back, we started getting nervous. I remembered that the best dboy I ever had lived about a quarter mile down the road from where we were but he went to jail and I hadn't done business with him for over a year. I mentioned to my buddy that I had a dude I used to see out that way and I was going to drive past his house. His car was there! I slowed down to try to remember which door was his, and wouldn't you know it he walks out the front door. I was so excited I stopped the car and yelled his name. After turning around and pulling in, he gave me his new cell phone number and hooked us up with twice as much as we would have got from my friends connect. He even asked us if we wanted brown dope or a fent mix. It was a million to one shot he would have been at his moms house or that he would have walked out at a time where I could get his new number and get my favorite plug back. Junkie Jesus definitely paid us a visit today. I am blown away at the fact that I randomly decided to drive past his house, that he was home, and walking out just as I was there.

You know when you can't pee? Here are some tips to get flowing.,"Any time I've had trouble peeing there has been a psychological component, especially before I discovered opiates. Sometimes it's just being in the same bathroom as someone you are uncomfortable being around, having to pee without a door or someone outright talking to you while you try to pee.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I just have to think about happy things. That new graphics card you bought... fixate on it mentally. That girl you hooked up with last month that you stopped talking to on good terms but gave great head... evoke that thought. 

That time you took command of the fleet and subdued the empire? Yeah, that can work.

The time you went to the soup kitchen and felt really pious about your actions, sure you can use that too if you're a smug prick who's prick won't pee. To each his/her own.

&nbsp;


Aside from successful past sexual experiences, recent financial successes, recent acquisitions of material posessions and memorable ""good energy"" moments being recalled there are other tricks to get peeing. 

&nbsp;

Before we continue, just last week I was visiting my friend and his wife and for some reason they did not have the TV on for the entire evening. We just sat there and talked and worked on our respective tasks. 

When it came time to use the bathroom there was no background noise except for their conversation and I just couldn't pee. I tried three times but just wasn't happening. Surely the suboxone I consumed that morning was contributing. 

Finally after leaving, I went down the block and behind a bank or insurance broker's building and found a nice cold yet cozy corner to offload my fluidic waste. In that case it was evident that it was mostly psychological but it is possible the at the cold air helped the process along.

&nbsp;


Finally, another more recent time when I was visiting my friend and his wife with the TV off I did do something else to get the flow started. Didn't bother blocking my ears shut... simply put on a movie and skipped to a favorite scene. Shortly thereafter the flow started.

* Sc-Fi series scenes work

* Anime--- all the cool shit that happens in any given Gundamverse.

* Stand-up comedy

* Even scrolling through instagram (doesn't always work).

* Letting the phone generate background noise of any kind from videos or music.


&nbsp;


I've tried sitting with a low success rate. The aforementioned tricks have worked best for me and even when we blame our opioids we can still leverage the psychological element of the issue to get pissed off (pun intended).",1514754159.0

I'd tried heroin once or twice about a year ago and enjoyed it but only bought it a few times as I was trying to get better (still am). I'm on methadone now and I rarely use but when I do it's almost always heroin. Just for the past two months or so. I had been dealing with only one connect for a month and a half, but recently met another one that I'd much rather deal with (always on time, friendly, gives deals when I buy in bulk, etc). For the first two weeks she actually had the same, if not similar dope to my last connect. It was a very dark brown, almost purpley when you looked at it under the light. It wasnt cut at all, and it was so good. But this week, her dope has been a different color and I notice when I hear my spoon and mix the shot there are small black specks on it sometimes. Whatever that is, it gets filtered out. But with the old dope it always free up brown, usually so dark it was almost opaque in the needle and it was hard to see the blood come into it. Now with this new dope, it draws up almost clear even when the shot knocks me right on my ass. It has a brown tint but the product itself is a lot lighter, doesn't seem to be cut more by her after she gets it from her guy, I usually meet her at her house as she gets home from picking up and she takes it right out of her own and weighs it out, and it's more of a tan colour. Once it's in the rig it looks like a light kinda murky brown, sometimes I can hardly see the brown and it looks almost clear. Now my question is regarding fentanyl. I know for a fact that the stuff she was selling before this didn't have fent in it, but I'm starting to think that this does and that it may be a lot. I meant to take pictures but woke up and did my last shot without remembering to take it. But based of my poor description would you assume that it's fent? If so, would it just be laced or would it be more fent than dope at this point? I'm beginning to think that it's mostly fent just because I've never seen any dope draw up into this colour.

So what do you guys think? Your input is highly appreciated lmao",1514744553.0

Just have a question regarding the extended release version of Nucynta (Tapentadol). 

My father has chronic Lyme Disease and is on a TON of meds for it. For those of you that don't know, it's a crippling illness that makes everyday activities next to impossible due to pain, cognitive issues, and other symptoms. That's a little besides the point, but he's the reason I have access to Nucynta. He doesn't like them and is about to switch meds, but he has a ton left... so before he flushes them, I grabbed one 200mg Nucynta ER for myself to try.

Now I'm by no means a frequent opiate user, but have tried some different ones throughout the past couple of years. Besides already trying my dad's Tramadol and initial release Nucynta, I've also tried Vicodin when my friend offered me some (he had them for a bad back injury), and I think I tried Percocet maybe once. They made me feel pretty good. If I had to compare, I think I liked the Vicodin the most, but its effects didn't last long. I did however also really enjoy the effects of the immediate release version of Nucynta (think it was 100mg). 

So anyways, today I have the opportunity to take a 200mg Extended Release Nucynta, and after plenty of research of safety and interactions with my other medicine (I also take 100mg of Wellbutrin for my (thankfully) fleeting depression and 30mg/day of Propranolol for anxiety). There were a few interactions, but nothing I was concerned about. Does anybody have any experience with the extended release version of this Nucynta medication? Is it a similar high to the immediate release version? I know it lasts longer obviously, but just looking to see what effects I'd get from this. 

Looking forward to taking this and am curious to hear your opinions about it. 

Thanks everyone and enjoy your opiates responsibly!  ",1514744085.0

Once the wormy thing comes out the infection seems to come out really quickly and easily, and it seems to clear up and start to heal right after that. This has happened twice now.

i am also curious how it will feel for me. my usual dose of oxy is 30mgs and that feels very nice three times a day. sometimes i might double the dose and that has me very very noddy like its almost too much. sometimes makes me sick to my stomach. i would probably try to ween down for a day or two to get my oxy dose down and lowered so i could enjoy the morhphine better.

7nkbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nkbpc/my_story/,6,https://redd.it/7nkbpc,pillsonpillsonpills,My Story,"Bored outta my mind, figured it couldn‚Äôt hurt to write something down. The following is my story with opiates. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, my best friend introduces me to roxy 30s, this is 6 years ago. I pop one, we chill at his place, didn‚Äôt feel nothing and thought it was the biggest waste of $25 and would of much rather a ‚Äúdub‚Äù (this is when I was starting to get big into maryjane). My background is white upper middle class I would suggest and my friends family had a lot more money. I get my wisdom teeth out, I get a script of Perc 5s. Same day I got them out my mom gave me 3 of the perc 5s and a xanax. That was the first time I ever got high off percs and right away could tell why people got addicted and liked them. Thinking about it, my mom easily finished half the script. That was my first ever taste, I wouldn‚Äôt do oxy again until my third year in college. I had a party  for my high school graduation and that same best friend before asked if I wanted to get some roxys for my grad party And i said sure. Gave him the money, never saw him again. Was only ($50) but he just kinda threw away our 6 year friendship over some stupid petty shit. As you might be able to tell, he was in the deeper stages of addiction. Third year of college comes and one of my coworkers brings up roxy, talks about how he has a connect and he loves them. I threw college parties often and he was kinda nerdy so I would always invite him to them, he would always ask if I wanted to get roxy with him and I said yes. This is where my first ever trips to go to a dealer would begin. They‚Äôre $$30 a piece..fuckk but ok buying 2 cya later. This small but consistent dosage of 2 a week would just increase maybe to 4 a week. Idk how but I told my mom I had this roxy connect( I didn‚Äôt have him directly I had to hit up my coworker who always made me front him) I didn‚Äôt mind fronting him, I liked him, he helped me out, and he always paid back on time. This connect had roxy all the time, and I have no idea how but I never had to worry about fakes with him either. He was 24 white male. I started picking up more like 15, most were for my mom who at the time had ‚Äúback pain‚Äù and back surgery so I felt like I was helping her out. And she loved me!! Of course she did right. My coworker one night gets arrested for possession of heroin. What I think he was doing was getting me to front him, he would get me pills and use his money on dope. Anyway, he gave me the connects number and the connect saw me enough to the point he was cool meeting me alone. I started slowly spending every dollar ever on them, and my mom too. My mom has a very upstanding career as well as my dad, but we were quickly spending a combined $1000 a pickup. When I started running out of money my mom would say you going to see him? ‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt have money for them, but if you get me 2 I‚Äôll go‚Äù (I said 2 because this was kind of a hassle, the guy lived like 45mins-1hr away depending on traffic. My mom gave me 2 every time and that year I got the best grades I ever got. Going into ever night class every day of the week, snorted 60mg of roxy before every class and got As and Bs, first time ever in college(before I partied hard and smoked weed all the time and never went to class) but I somehow learned like a champ bc I was totally ok getting high at school and learning. Whatever it worked. I get a gf, and she‚Äôs so straight edge, never seen pot before yada yada does good in school nerd type girl. I really loved her, but kept my love for roxy a secret. Only my friends knew but all of us hanging out she started to hear stories of me snorting pills and crazy shit happening. One dAy she wanted to try some. She was TINY. 5 foot, maybe 90 pounds. I was hesitant on letting her try it  bc I was starting to learn the bad path it could lead you on. I let her know that these aren‚Äôt a joke and they‚Äôre dangerous, like probably all of us, she took on the challenge. Oh yes, the beautiful drug relationship requiem of a dream shit began. As any normal human she loved it. Started buying some with me, she would stay a lot lower in dosage tho, maybe 15mg for her when at this point I was idling around 45-60mg. The good thing about pills is that they‚Äôre so expensive it kinda limits you out. My dosage never really went beyond 60mg bc they were so expensive and couldn‚Äôt afford a more expensive habit. My gf, my mom, and I are buying pills people. I‚Äôm keeping this dealer dude in fucking business. Paying across the board $30 a pill...

One day, hm dude doesn‚Äôt answer me. Again no answer later on in the day, next thing you know, I am experiencing withdraw for the first time. Wow this is actually ass haha. Come to find out dude got arrested, and the guy who he was with narc‚Äôd on him. He gets out like in 7 days, hits me up immediately. I‚Äôm his money maker yanno. Boom, like clockwork we get this train rolling again. Maybe a few months go buy, life‚Äôs great, my mom, gf, and I are all high and happy, we‚Äôre both getting good grades, working making money...the good life. 

Again, one day no answer from dudey. Immediately I‚Äôm like ugh not again, and yes it was again. He gets arrested and I would never talk to him again even still. I only found out bc I searched and found him in the jails database. I am curious whatever happened to him and where he‚Äôs at. I no longer have a connect, withdrawals again, lil rough patch no big deal.

How fast did you guys break your new years resolution haha 

So last night a couple close friends and I had a get to gether to end the year off with good times.
Having a few beers, plenty of whiskey sours and enough bud to go around, we had a blast. Singing punk and folk songs around the camp fire, conversation filling the air. 

Starting to get a bit drunk, I decited to ask my friend if she could get me a 100mg Morphine. 
She hosted the party, and I know her mom has the motherload of medicine cabinets. 
Iv barked up this tree for years and its almost a joke now. As usual she doent comply lol

Being a bit drunk and confident, i took it upon my self to ask her mom. 
Im really close to the family and felt i could do it with out much repercussions. 

At first she was a bit shocked I even knew she had any opiates to begin with. But after a bit of sweet talking a making a shit load of popcorn she said ""ill see you inna sec"" and sent me on my way.

Out side for about 5 minutes, her mom comes out and stands away from everyone by the table. I get up and proceed to throw away my beer. 
""Come inside"" she whispered. 
I followed her into the kitchen and she explained ""I dont want to give you a 100mg because they are too strong, but I have this 30mg roxi and 30mg ir morph"" I couldint thank her enough. I offerd to pay, but she laughed and said to just wash her car...Fuckin DEAL! 

I get home and the drunk is wearing off as im preping both the roxi and morphine for IV. 
Iv never iv'd morphine but always wanted to. (I always plug) and dont think oxycodone is all that great iv unless you have alot imho. 

I figured this combo would be great since I love it so much with other ROAs
As soon as im swabbing my injection site my roomate comes home. 
Hes a opiphile aswell but doesnt iv, soo im lowkey about it. 
He brings home a half grizzy of blow. So i hold off on the nodd to enjoy some slopes with him;)

Today i wake up with a preloaded rigg 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morph. :):):)
I wake up with a ear to ear grin. 
Make coffe, take shower, play some vidya and call family. Now im ready...

Swabb site. And were off to the races. 
I push slow and steady and by time im half way through i start to feel eye pressure.
Befor i pull out the needle the pins and needles flood the lower half of my body and my legs are melting. 
Wow..... Just.. Wow
Iv never experienced a sensation like this. 
I have iv'd dilaudid and that was all a head rush with no legs. 

This, this was a new beast. 
Slowly the oxy began to take effect giving a pleasent euphoria to add but the morphine really stole the show. Great combo i might add. 

I melt in my seat, take a rip out the bole, spark a cigg and feel the eye pressure take over to a semi nodd state. 
Im in heaven. But do not take it for granted, i bask in the opiate soaked blanket that was once my skin.... Beautiful just beautiful. 

Though my tolerance was super low, and i could have enjoyed a bit stronger of a dose. All in all I enjoyed the hell out of it. Probably exactly the dose i needed since i had family dinner a few hours after and didint want to be all doped out...



Thanking the opiate gods for blessing me with this gift. These only come around so often... So thank you. 

Peace...

I got clean one year and two months ago. I was laying on a mattress in my living room, just staring at the wall and fucking hating myself. I did a massive line of dope and realized that self-loathing never went away...it was just was hiding under an opiate haze. I had an absolute moment of clarity and realized that I was going to die if I kept going--I checked myself into rehab the next day and never looked back.

My only real point is this: Being clean actually stops fucking sucking. It was really hard for the first few months...if for no other reason than having to re-remember how to be person and talk to people about things that weren't horror stories and really fucked up drug jokes. Having feelings again was super awkward; I honestly stumbled through a period of time where I felt like a robot learning to act human. I met some great people and some terrible ones. *But* my brain settled down and it didn't feel so weird anymore. I don't think about wanting heroin at all. I have a great job, an apartment, a boyfriend and I can actually afford nice things when I want them.

I'm not here to brag, or to tell you you should get clean--do your drugs if that's what you want to do--but if you want to quit and feel like you can't, I'm here to tell you that it's totally possible. It's a new year, people are making some bullshit resolutions...but it wouldn't be the worst to follow through with getting off your DOC this year, if you feel like it's eating away at you.

And if you're going to keep getting high, FFS get some Narcan and be smart about it. I've lost *so* many good people over the past few years and this subreddit has lost even more. Nod as safely as you can and stay on this Earth longer.

Well, I basically became addicted to loperomide, and I was taking about 150 of them a day, constantly fucked up from them, never got back on my sub dose, and eventually started using heroin heroin again on top of the lope. So all of this has been going on in the last few months, and between the anxiety, the lope, and heroin and cocaine I realized that I hadn't shit in AT LEAST 10 days. I couldn't even remember when the last time I shit was, but normally I'd give myself  enough time each morning to shit  before I took all my drugs for the the day but with a lot on my mind recently it  just slipped from my thoughts. Well I realized this and freaked out, started reading about bowel compaction and getting even more scared. So I told myself I wouldn't take any opiates until I got this shit out, waited a day, nothing, day 2 nothing and the anxiety is really getting up there, plus I can't eat or drink anything without throwing it back up almost immediately. Day three which was yesterday, I spent literally the whole day sitting on the toilet trying to force myself to go, and nothing. I drank a whole damn bottle of milk of magnesia, and even gave myself a fucking enema with no luck. So basically last night I said if I couldn't shit by the morning I was gonna get gloves and pull that shit out with my hand, and by this time I was three days into full blow withdrawals with piles of opiates sitting in my drawer calling my name, but I stuck to my word, and FINALLY early this morning after three entire sleepless days of withdrawals, and spending my whole New Years completely alone and freaking out I got up and sat on my toilette and over the course of an hour and a half gave birth to what had to be at least 6 pounds of shit. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life, that even dopesickness couldn't chock itself up to, but I didn't care because the amount of relief I felt after that was practically enlightening. And on top of that I had myself a nice little 3 day tolerance break, and you can bet your ass that I ran straight to my stash and banged, sniffed and smoked everything I could immediately after I took that shit, and cried from the euphoria of it all. Anyway this was my first post and I read through the rules but let me know if I did anything wrong. Hope y'all had a better New Year's Eve than me but I guess I'll spend today getting fucked up in celebration instead. ",1514823213.0

So I've tried Sub Maintenance a few times and each and every time I always take more than I'm prescribed and each month I tell myself that ""this month will be different"" because running out like even three days short is just miserable but I'm not sure if their is much of a tolerance potential on subs but some days I just don't feel ""right"" and I end up taking more than I should. Also note I don't have anyone close to me that I would trust with holding my script and even then  I think I would just feel more shitty more often. I don't know but if anyone has any input on this or any experience? Does anyone on Sub Maintenance take it exactly as prescribed?

Raids and heavy crackdowns in the area have made getting our usual favorite dope a pretty big hassle. Yesterday we ended up with shit that was half assed packaged and wasn't up to the normal standard. Today we hit up his makn dude and he had us come a bit further than where we usually go to him. We also had to wait a bit in a shit part of the city. He had the same stuff as yesterday which at first was disappointing but then he surprised us by handing over not 5 but 16 bundles. He explained this is what's currently going around and while he'd normally not hook us up to that extent, we'd now be getting more for our money as these bundles are less potent and have less in them than the standard. So even with that in mind , him giving us 16 instead of 5 more than made up for the drop in quality and quantity.

I held my boyfriends glock while he was at work. I googled & found how to aim for your brain stem. Then I suddenly decided to take a nap.,"I searched and found that like idk something like 5% end up mentally retarded and vegetative instead of dead. So I made sure I knew where to aim and where to put the gun in your mouth to hit your brain stem. I fixed a noose again that I had made earlier this summer after I got out of rehab, out of an exercise band. I tied it around my neck and figured if I shot myself and didn‚Äôt die, I‚Äôd at least be unconscious enough to still hang myself. I had the gun cocked and in my mouth. 

Then I suddenly got really tired. I had spent the last 7 or so months with no job after a shitty experience making me hate what I love best. I felt like a waste of heroin money sucking life. I figured I was better off dead to everyone than the burden I can be on and finding drugs. I thought it would make my boyfriend of 5 years less stressed. He calls me from work to make sure I‚Äôm not dead, a lot of times. 

I woke up to a phone call from a man I‚Äôve been stopping in to see since April. I went to him for a job. He came looking for me... physically drove to my boyfriends workplace to ask if I‚Äôd work for him... bc I was so depressed I wouldn‚Äôt answer my phone. I ended up going away to a 40 day rehab and missing my opportunity. I felt worthless, coming home sober and jobless. I relapsed a few weeks later. So I get this call, it‚Äôs John. He needs someone to fill in tomorrow. Can I come? It was seriously like one of those moments where you don‚Äôt know what to do but just sob.

I got on methadone the following week. I haven‚Äôt held a gun or exercise band in my hand since. My boyfriend hasn‚Äôt found paintings of nooses in my sketchbook. I hope 2018 can look 2017 in the eye and say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. 

My life has gotten infinitely better, though internally I feel infinitely worse‚Äî yet at least useful. That‚Äôs really all I wanted to say tonight. At least I‚Äôm here to say it, I suppose. ",1514938627.0

I am coming up on a BENZO ONLY induced euphoria.,"I know this isnt the benzo sub but im active here and know many of you dabble.

So I used the last of my opiates last night, and given my abundance of benzos (no massive tolerance but been using them the last 10 days or so), I thought I would give a bit of a cocktail a go.


T - 2 hours: 20mg omeprazole (inhibits CYP3A4, enzyme that breaks down many benzos, and also great with morphine, tramadol and codeine)


T - 1 hour: 200mg cimetidine (another CYP3A4 inhibitor but also inhibits CYP2D6 so dont use this one with your opiates)


T - 30 minutes: Two double expressos.


T = 0: 200mg Tetrazepam (a rarer, weakish benzo lacking hypnotic properties but has some anxiolytic and significant muscle relaxant action)


T + 10 minutes: 0.5mg alprazolam (xanax)


T + 15 minutes: 6mg Bromazepam (The god benzo) **and** 1.25mg lorazepam.


T + 30 Minutes: Climbing body warmth and everything feels cozy, significant anxiolysis, **cognitive euphoria** (that fuzzy, penetrating euphoria you get in like the basal center of your head, which I associate strongly with opiates, not quite as wholesome but its there).

Will be sublingualling 3mg bromazepam at the predicted peak and sipping on a half shot of rum+ iced tea. Will update.

*EDIT: T + 1 hour: 3mg Bromazepam + 0.5mg alprazolam sublingual.*

*T + 1.5 hours: wow I'm feeling as good if not better than 40mg of plugged morphine (low/mild tolerance).*",1514926865.0

I'm in Day 3 (more like 3.5) of withdrawal, and I'm hurting. Mentally a wreck. In 10 days I have a refill. And I'm debating going on this week and asking for an increase in dose, potentially fucking the whole thing up.

Do I risk it? Or just suffer through. 10 days seems like a fucking eternity. I'll get a bunch then.

I know the answer. Kratom is helping. Kpins too. Sleep is easy. Xanax is great for that.

When will the withdrawals stop so I can just be ok waiting a few days?

Also, question 2. I've gone to same doctor for 2 years. Never asked for an increase. Always same dose. I am on these meds long term. Could I have an honest talk and ask for a small increase? Explain that tolerance after 2 years has taken a toll and the pain is building. I take 3x10 a day. Would asking for 4, after never asking, never missing a pee test etc, set off any red flags?

Thanks community. Just need a little help. Had to step out to my car, had a little emotional breakdown. 

TLDR - just tell me that time is gonna go quick. And is asking for a small bump in dosage after 2 years a bad thing?

So I have been using off and on for about 8 or 9 years. I have gotten clean several times, the longest being a 2-3 year stretch. This last go round I had been using opium for about 2 years before switching back to H (my DOC). I have been on the H again since September, so about 3 months now.




Here's the odd bit. I've been going through 1 g of pretty decent #4 H every 2-3 days. I have been trying to cut back so I have been doing *slighhhtttly*, and I mean just slightly smaller shots. When I do these shots I will get the rush and the nods, but the euphoria is lacking and immediatly following the rush I get a wave a of anxiety and depression that lasts about 15 min. After it fades it's business as usual. It doesn't happen when I take a proper sized shot.  This kind of thing has never happened and seems quite odd. Anyone else have experience with this?

7nnzsk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nnzsk/resolution_less_cliffposts/,13,https://redd.it/7nnzsk,sloan_fitch,Resolution: Less Cliffposts.,"New Year's Resolution: To avoid forging new tribulations with Cliff. I still look forward to sharing past tales about Cliff but I do not want to forge any new experiences. Last year I learned how is easy it was to get burned. I've come out of this year having better protected my interests but there is folly in hanging out someone like Cliff. I shouldn't have to always be on high alert when doing business with a ""friend"" in order to ensure he doesn't get one-up on me. I'd be so much better off if I just cut Cliff out of my life like so many suggest upon reading my tales.

&nbsp;

On odd weeks Cliff gets a benzo script. His hustle is to trade them up for dope. It seldom works out and in the past I used to pick up his benzo script from the pharmacy. One time he said ""would you pick it up if there was a good chance you'd have something before work?"" At the time I was nearly dope-sick so I was like hell yeah... Instead in that scenario Cliff consumed a bunch of benzos, was in and out of consciousness and mumbled through any conversations.


Most recently, I covered my ass. Bought subs and did not go through Cliff to get them because he's super unreliable for that. He did offer to get subs and I told him that's great, and that I would be happy to give him the money the minute I saw those subs in front of my face. He stopped mentining that sub connect a day later and re-focused on his hustle to get dope.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I was off from work but told Cliff I was working because I didn't want him calling my house phone or kocking on my door. He eventually texted ""text me back asap"" but none of his messages indicated why he was messaging me. Maybe I'd jump if there was a guarantee that he would give me some money he owes me but in all likelyhood he'd ask me to bike to the ATM to get his money because he's fat and lazy. 


Bottom line, I'm to run errands for him when it's 15 degrees outside. Plus there is a codependency thing going on here and it needs to be broken. I've taken steps in the right direction because I was sick of going into withdrawal. We all know that counting on Cliff's word to stay well often ends in me writing sad tales.

&nbsp;

Can I just keep avoiding him? Probably not and will have to confront him soon. I left an old MacBook at his house, I'd like to maintain pretenses long enough to get that back so for these days where I avoid him... perhaps I'll just make up a story like he usually does. ""I was sick"" or ""some bullshit came up""... 


I dunno.. I'm just glad I took steps to keep myself well and held on to my cash for my own purposes as it should be. Worst case hte old.

&nbsp;

In the future I'll maintain a ratio of non-cliffposts to cliffposts.",1514915344.0

Recently i've got access to buy few 200mg MST Continus (3 of them) for ~35 dollars.  
My tolerance is low - 240-390mg of codeine(to get pretty nice high) and i've never tried any other opiate.
oral bioavailability of morphine is around 25-30% (as i know) so hwow much i need to take to feel.. you know, great?
i could sniff that, but not sure if it's possible with these pills, and IV isnt for me, yet.  
so questions are:
- is it worth the price compared to 3$ for 150mg of codeine?
- how to dose it with my low tolerance, to get this opiate happiness that a lot of people are talking abouut?
- oral or sniff?
I wrote this on high so sorry for mistakes if there are, have a nice dayyy!

no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.

no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. thanks, and hope to see you there! don't use alone.",1515044388.0

A lot of places I call like hospitals and stuff say they can't confirm or deny. His mom reached out to me and she filed a missing persons but nothing yet. 
I feel like complete shit because I ignored his last few messages because he was asking me for money and I thought maybe he was using again.

It looks like I could probably salvage a shot out of it, which I'm *well aware* is desperate, ""carpet crawling"" level junkiedom, but what can I say? I'm a frugal junkie, and sometimes you find yourself in desperate times with no dope. 

So, my question to you, dear reader, is if anyone has any ideas on how I can possibly put together a shot from these disparate little bits of dope on the top of a table, I'd be much obliged (and no, scraping them off the table isn't an option, they're like little dried droplets or melted microchunks of tar). 

I've had a similar quandary with bags of tar in powder form where the sticky powder has dried all over the inside of the bag, and Im sure there's a decent little shot there somewhere, but collecting it all together into a shot has proven difficult to engineer.

I'm posting here because I really don't know who to talk to or where else to turn. I'm a heroin addict and have been for a few years now, I went in and out of rehab a few times and the last time I got clean I was living in a sober house. Long story short I ended up getting kicked out, and I had to move back to my old city. As this happened I also got cut off by my Suboxone doctor. I started getting sick and I remember hearing about how loperomide helped with withdrawals so I started taking it. My plan was to just take it until I could get set up with a new Suboxone doctor but I basically ended up getting addicted to immodium. I'm really scared honestly, because I don't want to be on it at all, and I know about the damage that it can do to the heart, the stomach and the body. I've been living in constant fear and anxiety because no matter what I do I can't seem to wean myself off of it. I have a few Suboxone strips but they don't seem to fully suppress the withdrawal from immodium so I always end up going back to it. I'm not getting high on it at all, I'm purely doing it to keep myself from being sick. It's been about a month since I started using it daily in large doses. I can't do this anymore. I did not come this far to die from a heart attack from fucking loperomide. I don't know what my options are, I don't know who to turn to. I have a doctor and insurance but I haven't gone to them yet because I thought maybe I could wean myself off alone. Please if anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, I need help. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to die. I just want to be clean and living my life and I'm terrified. Any help or advice at all would be helpful.  And again I'm aware of the effects this stuff will have on the body, so I'm not really looking to be scolded or made more scared than I already am. Just please help me figure out how I can get off this shit ",1515032404.0

Anyway, he called this morning. I told him I still haven't got it together and I was pretty sick so chances of me going out to hustle were slim. He says it's cool. He's just keeping updated.

Calls me again at about 3. I'm thinking, ""Jesus dude, you know what's up."" I answer anyway and he said ""get your ass outside.""

I've been clean for 70 days or so. The cravings have been really intense. Today I bought four OC40s. Funnily enough today some Kratom I ordered arrived. 

Been taking the Kratom all day, haven't touched the OC40s yet. By the way I'm not counting the Kratom as the relapse although I know some might.

I don't really have strong cravings to take the Oxys while I'm on the Kratom. I mean of course the Kratom isn't as good as Oxy but it's better than I thought it would be.

But the Oxys are just there. I regret buying them but I can't bring myself to flush them. I'm leaving the country in a few days and won't be back for a couple of months at least and will have no access while I'm away. Guess that helps me justify using them.

Feeling very disappointed in myself right now (although I haven't yet relapsed) and wondering if I have the strength to flush the things.

Sorry - I know my 'problems' are so pathetically minor compared to what a lot of you guys are going through. 

I should flush them right? ",1515014975.0

Usually it takes about 30 minutes to kick in for me, but I didn't get a rush at all during this, literally no come up what so ever... I did feel a little bit high after about an hour, but no come up what so ever. I know the pills weren't bunk (they're prescription) so what could it have been? Here are some variables... 

- I took them at 7pm, and I did eat something small at about 4pm... Is it possible I ate too soon? 

- I did do Kratom that day, about 9 hours before, and it was a longer lasting Kratom than usual... Could that have affected it? 

- My lowest dose IS 22.5mg, and I started with 20mg and added 5mg about 15 minutes later... Could the staggering of the dose be why I didn't feel a come up or rush? 

I'm going to try again tonight. What do you suggest? Not eating for 4 hours beforehand? Waiting longer than 9 hours after Kratom? (It would be 11 hours by the time I'm planning) Would taking the whole dose at once help?

Its okay to fail a few times, if you're failing you're trying. Just be careful with the dose when relapsing because your tolerance will be lower and shit can get dangerous.

Think of something to do with your free time instead of getting high, i would recommend something outside the house but i didn't had many options and instead opted for gaming.

Years ago when the company I worked for changed health insurance, we were stuck with an HMO that seemed to be against young-ish patients treating chronicle pain with narcotics, so I was cut off cold turkey. I panicked, had no clue what to do. I grovelled at the feet of my doctors, begged, then got pissed and decided to figure out how to treat my own pain. I had heard about online pharmacies so I just started scouring the internet and eventually found the forums. Anyhow, that was my start of online drug communities.

So anyhow, how I came to find this place was just me missing my online friends and the comradery of the old forums. 

I quickly realized this place was different than what I was used to in an online forum geared around pharms. Here folks are doing heroin and talking about it openly. I hate to say this but being honest I had a preconceived notions about heroin addicts because I had never been around it. Society had me scared of heroin addicts and homeless people. I was even freaked out about giving folks flying signs any money because they'd have to come near me. That was before RO 

Y'all, let me tell you how being here (mostly reading, commenting occasionally and posting a couple times when I needed your insight) has done for me as a person...

I see you and by that I mean I understand you. My struggles may not be anywhere close to what you have to go thru but I get it now. I'm no longer afraid. I no longer see homelessness and/or people holding signs as something to be afraid of. Being here has truly opened my eyes and heart in such a good way üíõ

I've seen so much compassion flowing around here and a general caring for each other that I've not seen before. Sure there's the occasional burst of troublemakers (trolls) but I've seen folks try to give even the most belligerent/rude folks benefit of the doubt and a chance to change their behavior. But for the most part the level of caring and helpfulness overrides the negetive that creeps in occasionally. 

Just wanted to share how being part of this community has enriched my soul.

So i tried this per 10 and had a good experience, i really enjoyed the high it gave me but i didn't really have a desire to do it again. 
months later, the same friend who introduced me to the perc 10, offered me to split the price with him on a blue 30mg roxy. I was nervous about trying it because its basically medical grade heroin but we still got a hold of it.
We split it in half and i broke a tiny chunk off of my half and crushed it up and snorted it. WOW. AMAZING. I LOVE THIS.
The high i got from sniffing an very small chunk of a 30mg roxy was one of the best feelings I've ever had, up there with sex, and tripping on acid/shrooms, except this shit is addicting.
fast forward a few months and here i am buying my own roxys. i went from doing a quarter of a quarter of the pill to sniffing half of it, to sniffing the whole thing, to sniffing 5 in one day, (5 was the most i did in one day) 
HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART
i have been doing at least one blue a day since august, maybe only a few sober days here and there but for the most part i have been addicted to roxys since the summer and i want to stop.
I am expecting withdrawal symptoms of course but i was wondering if anyone can predict how bad they are going to be/ how long they will last if i quit cold turkey. I spent at least $3000 on these pills and i just want to be done with them. I told myself that i would quit on jan 1st but that went out the window. I still have 4 blues left to try to taper myself off of them. anyone got any advice for me?
I cannot let my parents know about this, they are extremely closed minded and strict about me even smoking weed, so they would have a meltdown if they found out i am addicted to Roxy
I just don't want anything bad to happen to me. Thanks for reading this ramble jamble of words that describes my down falling life.i just wanna be happy without using hard drugs !

I have been taking 10mg norco for a while now. Norco is 10mg hydrocodone and 325mg acetaminophen. I take 3 to 4 per day. I know it's an issue, not here for it.

Anyway, sometimes when I can't get Norco, I will buy Oxycodone 30mg. I'll take a 4th of the pill at a time: 7.5mg oxycodone. I do get happy and high when I take them, but I notice I am not as carefree as I am with Norco. I almost WANT to be mad. I almost WANT to complain, I WANT to find things about people that are wrong in my eyes and then berate them about them. Of course, I don't do this. But this is no where near the kind of person I am. 

Sometimes when I take too much Norco, if I take one then forget and take another, taking double my dose (20mg), I do get a little irritated because I feel like I am overwhelmed with the high and I can't focus on what's going on around me, so I get flustered. This is much different than the irritability that oxycodone makes me feel. 


TLDR; Hydrocodone makes me happy while Oxycodone makes me angry. 10mg Hydro, and 7.5mg Oxy taken at a time. Anyone else experience this?

Am shooting a film this year with the opioid situation as the films backdrop. In particular drug store robberies. (The moderators have approved this post)

Wanted to come on here and connect with some people who might be interested in sharing their knowledge or thoughts on the subject!

The film is about a kid who's coerced to rob a pharmacy. 90% takes place in the drug store, real time, and things don't go to plan.

Please message me. Would love to share more about the project and get your opinion, thoughts and advice on it.

Size of problem - up to 3-400 mg per day

Duration - ~16 months

More context - on SSRIs for anxiety and depression already, so I know where I‚Äôm about to get kicked. 

Prior to quitting, I was able to switch to kratom for a month or two (or three, who knows), which is every bit as addictive. I think it should remain legal, since it‚Äôs pretty much impossible to OD on it and I‚Äôm more of a choose-your-own-adventure kinda guy, but the K advocates arguing it‚Äôs not addictive should tell that to my toilet.  Kratom is extremely addictive and withdrawals will be hell, kid (I‚Äôm talking to a kid now). 

Nonetheless, I tapered for about two weeks prior to quitting.  I officially logged Dec. 28 as Day 1 & I‚Äôm going to be clean for 2018. 

Day 1 & 2 weren‚Äôt bad, with the help of some pregbalin.

Day 3 is when shit hit the fan (& everywhere else). Despite flying myself to a beach before doing this, I didn‚Äôt crawl out of my room starting here until Day 6 (even then it‚Äôs hard). RLS was the worst and most persistent symptom. Tylenol, Xanax, and loperamide helped with the rest. 

Day 4 & 5 were the peak but same symptoms as Day 3.   Yes, I wanted to die. But you‚Äôll get through it. My advice is to take what you need, within reason, to get past this point.  2 dose of NyQuil, OR Lyrica, OR benzos.  Just don‚Äôt mix meds that do the same thing in the same day.   I wish i had clonodine, too. Just be careful- that shit affects your heart rate and you don‚Äôt realize how much you‚Äôve had until your hands are cold. 

Day 6 was my first day where my head almost felt normal but I was overwhelmed by the butterflies seeming to start at my belly and taking over the rest of me. Pregbalin helped a lot with this (& this is the first day where I imagined how easy it would be to have a Lyrica problem). 

Day 7 I was able to stay off the benzos & I went for a full body massage. The RLS lessened But was still bad enough to keep me up at night, to an extent.  This was the first day that beta blockers were enough to help with my anxiety. Before, they couldn‚Äôt cut through at all. 

Day 8 was more of the same but the butterflies have reduced each morning since Day 5. I went almost the entire day with nothing but knew I‚Äôd need the pregbalin to sleep. Reduced my dosage to 75 mg from a peak of ~6-900 mg. 

Day 9 was almost almost close to normal outside of the sometimes bad anxiety but I popped a 150 mg pregbalin anyway. I shouldn‚Äôt have. Not taking this shit tomorrow (it‚Äôs now Day 9).  I don‚Äôt want to trade addictions. 

The amount of crying I‚Äôve done over television story arcs today is a testament to the amount of suppressed emotion I‚Äôve had over the past year and change. It‚Äôs not the worst thing, by any stretch. Legs are still kicking but it‚Äôs manageable. 

I‚Äôve worked out most days, somehow. It hasn‚Äôt helped give me any kind of relief yet but a lot of others have found it useful. It does keep my mind occupied for an hour though. 

I have not had any problems eating. I have, however, had problems keeping it in me. 


Updates::

Day 10 - So far so good. I have more moments of clarity and less anxiety. I know I‚Äôm passed the worst of it. Popped some loperamide but nothing else, so far. That may change tonight if I have trouble sleeping. I need to get off the Lyrica. It‚Äôs already stopped being effective, which I can recognize intellectually, but i can see a future where I‚Äôm popping it anyway. Besides, it‚Äôd be nice to preserve these for episodes, etc.  I have to go to a giant social thing in New Orleans, of all places, for a few days next week and even the thought of it gives me anxiety. Going to head to the beach and try to focus on the now for a bit. Main symptoms are moderate anxiety, bathroom stuff, and a lot of random emotional bursts, which have only really served to get my gf to stop returning my texts. 



Postscript From Original::

I also have zero support system. One person knows what I‚Äôm doing and she doesn‚Äôt seem much interested in the process. Hoping this writing helps myself, at the least. When I get back from the beach in a few days, I‚Äôm going to look up meetings or something. 

Happy to post updates or answer any Qs if anyone is interested. 

Answering my main question prior to starting ‚Äî Day 6 was the first day I could see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

My second question was when I‚Äôd feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. My hope is it‚Äôs Day 10. Wish me luck :)

I'm looking to start my detox from oxycodone either today or tomorrow. I've been on and off oxycodone for about a year, so I've done this a few times- not proud.

Anyway I have 1.5 Subs (the pill form). I also have xanax and kpins to help- I never take either really, just not for me.  Anyone have the best way to go about this?  My main concern is possibly having seizure and possibly ending up in the hospital. I am definitely scared about this possibility. Should I stay away from the xanax and hope I'm good with just a sub? I usually prefer the sub strips as I think the pill form sucks. Will the xanax put me at  risk?

I was thinking about most likely starting Saturday morning. Waking up, taking a quarter xanax, and see how long I could make it without a sub. Is this a bad idea? I am aware of taking subs too soon about precipitated WD but intend  to only need 12 hours for subs. Seriously just want to do this safely and ensure I don't end up having a seizure or end up in the hospital, or worse case dead.


I'm taking anywhere between 180-240mg a day to give you an idea. In the past, once I make it to day 3 I usually turn the corner and feel much much better.

I realize you've already gone through both sides of the vein. But if the syringe fills with blood as you pull out, and you push down, is there a chance it'll work? Or is it destined to fail at that point no matter what since you already poked a hole in the other side of the vein?

hello everyone first post been lurking daily for a few months and love the discussion/content. anyway i created this account to ask this question. i have the typical story took percs here and there from a teenager til about a year ago when my son was born. that makes me sound like a scumbag i know and i kinda am but ive been an alcoholic daily drinker since 16 and knew i couldn‚Äôt be drunk all the time with a newborn (im late 20s now btw). So I drank rarely but started taking percs more often at first, justifying that i didnt like to nod and i only like the energetic euphoric side to opiates and i wasnt addicted to them because my problem was alcohol. i still didnt think i was ‚Äúfully‚Äù addicted until i tried to quit on January 1st for 30 days (no alcohol included) and only take kratom, after 2 months of both opiates everyday and alcohol almost everyday. on the 2nd (about 36 hours in) i woke up in a pool of sweat after a rough nights sleep.  yesterday was the same and i realized i was in withdrawal. today i woke up about the same but not quite as bad and was feeling optimistic. i hung out with my son and started making breakfast for my wife who was out getting groceries and felt ok, and just feeling ok made me feel happy. then she came home and freaked on me a little bit because i left her credit card in my wallet and she couldn‚Äôt pay for the groceries at checkout, which she was justified in doing but it triggered this insane manic episode in me. i turned off the eye of stove i was heating up, put the eggs and shit back in the fridge and said i was sorry and started heading upstairs and she got a little more pissed because she thought i was being a dick. i collapsed on our bed and started crying, then sobbing. i started hyperventilating and shaking and thinking about how much of a worthless pile of shit i was. what a weak pussy i was, how i couldn‚Äôt do anything right, how she didnt want to fuck me anymore and why would she im disgusting (we have sex everyday) how my son didn‚Äôt need me no one did and i should kill myself. how i never tried to accomplish any of my dreams and how i never would, and just let everyone down. how i secretly did heroin on christmas while hanging out with them, on my baby‚Äôs first christmas. and if i hadn‚Äôt i wouldn‚Äôt have enjoyed it. how the only reason i enjoyed watching a Charlie Brown christmas with my little baby and my wife was cuz i was high and that made the memory worthless anyway. i punched myself repeatedly in the head and face telling myself i wasn‚Äôt strong enough to leave a mark or protect my family (Now face covered in bruises). she tried to come upstairs and apologize even though it really had nothing to do with her or what she said. i called my guy and got him to front me five 20mg percs. 85 dollars gone before pay day. she picked them up for me, i told her she didnt have to and i could call him back and cancel. she said she was over it/me and got them. 

we talked for awhile and we‚Äôre good again. she‚Äôs asleep on the couch, baby‚Äôs asleep upstairs. i am scared for my future and don‚Äôt want to be this person, i wasn‚Äôt like this before. my baby deserves a good dad. i dont want my wife to tell them someday i killed myself or overdosed. i have now almost fully come down from the hundred millis and don‚Äôt ever wanna be in that mental state again. I need to be happy for my family, and not a fucking junkie or an alcoholic. 

For those that have stopped and powered through that depression from such, how did you do it? what did you change? or do u just have to be insanely sad for awhile and hope it goes away? maybe if i had kratom that morning it wouldnt have happened, but that would have just prolonged the inevitable right? im sorry for rambling and if this doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Im mentally exhausted and feel pathetic for making it not even 4 days in. and just to clarify I don‚Äôt think I would ever really hurt myself intentionally besides the punching thing I did today.",1515125957.0

I don't & haven't been taking it daily but today I needed it and was out of it and due for a refill.

So, my Dr called it in and I picked it up. I got home and took what I thought was a 5mg tablet because I had been having muscle spasms and needed a little sleep. However, I slept for 5hours so when I woke up I grabbed the script and checked it out. 

Turns out the pharmacy prescribed me WAYYYY more than they should have. They did THIRTY 10mg diazepam tablets!!! I was shocked. It's like Junkie Jesus is trying to drag me back into hell.

So, I called my doctor and was like, ""uhhhh yah I have way more pills than I should"" He advised I take 5 out for the month, and give the rest to my parents to give me 5 tablets every 30 days for the next 6 months. Since I now basically have a 6 month supply of it. 

The instruction now is to break them in half to make them 5mg tablets. Knowing me I'll probably make 2.5mg tablets by breaking them into 4ths.

Anyway, my dilemma now is that even though I've been honest about it with my doctor IDK if I really want my parents holding onto them. In the past, they've denied me access to medications (opiates) that I've needed and its always a fight. I don't want to get back into counting pills with them either. So, dunno.

I remember there was one guy on here from Ireland who found a bag with like 3 ounces in it.

I ordered 14g of gunpowder on the DNMs last week for $800, and when the vendor didn't ship it out before the weekend, I opened a dispute, because the world revolves around me and I found it wholly unacceptable for him not to structure his life around feeding my drug habit.

I wasn't even looking to get a refund, I was just pitching an e-tantrum because I am a dopesick brat, but a day or two after I had opened the dispute the vendor sends a message to the effect of ""I can't find your tracking number, so here's your money back.""  My dope arrived today, and it is fire.  So I got half an ounce for free by being a spoiled cunt.

Other than that, the best I can think of was when I ordered a ball of ECP from a vendor and he accidentally shipped me the same order twice.  I actually handled this one in an honorable fashion and told the vendor what happened, and I was getting ready to send him $300 for the extra dope, but before I could do it he got banned for scamming people.  So I don't feel bad about that one.

Has anyone else ever had a ridiculous amount of free drugs fall into their lap?  I'm not talking about finding a couple loose bags on the sidewalk while you're sick, or discovering dope you hid in a benzo blackout. I mean real JJ-comes-down-from-heaven-to-blow-you finds",1515116721.0

- xanax solubility in water is around 0.04 mg/mL. Therefore if I use 20mL that will give a dose of 0.8mg (decent dose at my tolerance) in that 20mL (which can be injected using a 20ml barrel and butterfly iv slowly).

- **note a pill filter will be used**

- as all the impurities are siphoned out via the filter, this leaves 0.8mg xanax in a 20ml solution.

- if this injected slowly, should there be any complications? I mean they use basically all benzos in pure form in hospitals for iv use (ofc in PG instead of water due to volume discrepencies), so im assuming pure xanax being injected shouldnt cause a problem? (problems only arising if pill additives enter blood from not using a filter

is this correct? cheers guys :)

**Entry 28** - Friday, 4:58 PM

Relieved to say we survived the storage closet. Chloe, Ben, Spooner, and I made it to the nurse‚Äôs office in the detox ward. I really thought we were goners there for a minute. I was actually praying, which is not something I do. It sounded like the people were piling up outside the door, finally about to break through. Out of nowhere, we hear a lot of commotion, things breaking, lots of grunting. Slowly the noise volume got lower and lower, until all that remained was a fragile silence. 

We cracked the door open as quietly as possible. There was Ben, in all his glory, standing in the middle of the hallway. He looked at us excitedly through his messy hair. Bruised and bloodied, he fell to his knees with a metal pipe in his right hand and Spooner, unmoving, slumped over his left shoulder. 

He had seen us go into the storage closet but was busy trying to wake up the unconscious Spooner so they could come rescue us. Spooner wouldn't wake up so he just bludgeoned his way to us on his own, with Spooner in one arm and a 3ft. cast-iron pipe in the other. 

After the rescue, we began to hear more bodies coming from the stairwell so we quickly darted past the double doors into the detox ward only to find about 30 of them in the next hallway. They all stopped and slowly turned to look at us in unison. We made a dash for the first door which happened to be the nurse‚Äôs office, which is where we are now.


**Entry 29** - Friday, 5:37 PM

It feels like we will be safe for the time being. We have in front of us the strongest door in the building with double deadbolt locks and a steel reinforced window. The walls are made of cinderblocks, with tile flooring all around. So, the entry point is heavily secured and is the only way in. But, it‚Äôs also the only way out. There is no food in here, and the only water is a nearly empty water dispenser used when people take their meds.

Ben hung up a cloth behind the windows to prevent the things out there from looking in. They seem to get more agitated when they can see us. The doctor and one of the orderlies that had harassed Chloe were out there, along with Joey and a few other familiar faces. It's a mix of residents and staff, and couple people I have never seen before.

Chloe is working on getting Spooner to come to. He is hardly breathing and his lips are turning blue. We are pretty sure he overdosed.


**Entry 30** - Friday, 6:16 PM

Still in the nurse‚Äôs room. We splashed the rest of the water on Spooner‚Äôs face to try and get him to wake up, but it did nothing. We will keep trying anything we can.

It‚Äôs probably starting to get dark outside, and the emergency lights in here are beginning to dim. We have been discussing whether or not what‚Äôs going on in here is also going on out in the city.

Before he rescued us, Ben was in a room that had a window facing across the street. He said it looked like a hurricane had come through the town. Windows busted out, debris all over the street, no cars driving in the street, and no people walking around. 

What Ben had seen plus all the eerie signs in the previous few days--police/ambulance sirens, tense staff, mom not answering phone, no visitors--leads me to believe this may be going out there as well. 


**Entry 31** - Friday, 7:02 PM

Spooner is finally awake. Ben broke through the lock on the med cabinet and Chloe found narcan within it. She must not have ever had to administer narcan before because she did it Pulp Fiction style. She jabbed that damn needle in his neck and he rocketed upright, eyes wide. I told her if she ever needs to do that to me, if she‚Äôd politely stick it in my thy instead.

Once Spooner got his bearings, he started freaking out once he realized where we are. He claims the ‚Äújunkies‚Äù are attracted to the opiates. That‚Äôs why they are accumulating outside, from all the opiate medication in here. He says that even if it‚Äôs in your system, they can smell it.

I write this as the bitter orange taste of the suboxone still lingers under my tongue. I couldn‚Äôt help myself after Ben opened up the med cabinet and I saw boxes upon boxes of 8mg strips. I also threw a few bottles of 1mg alprazolam in my backpack for good measure. In the midst of the situation, I didn't think this was timely to be coming off meds completely. Although, if Spooner is correct, I will come to regret that decision while the suboxone remains in my system.

Oh, and Spooner *did* overdose--on carfentanil that he had snuck in on the back of postage stamps. Which, apparently, means that it was not the Narcan that brought him out of his OD because, ‚ÄúNaloxone isn‚Äôt strong enough to push carfent off the receptors you idiot.‚Äù

So I guess it was just the lucky neck punch chloe delivered that shook him out of it.


**Entry 32** - Friday,  8:40 PM

From what I can see by peeking through the makeshift curtains, there are more of them amassing outside the door. It‚Äôs hard to say for sure, because the smoke doesn‚Äôt allow me to see very far, but I would guess that there are at least 40 out there. It‚Äôs clear they know we are in here. 

They all seem have similar attributes: enormously dilated pupils, rough skin covered in goosebumps, stiffly raised body hair, plenty of sweat, and an awkward  gait.

Chloe's is calling them zombies.

Spooner has dubbed them either simply ‚ÄúJunkies,‚Äù or, my favorite, ‚ÄúStringers,‚Äù because that‚Äôs what he calls people who don't care about looking strung out.

Ben just calls them crackheads.


**Entry 33** - Friday, 10:04 PM

We are preparing to leave the room, we‚Äôve been trapped in here for about 5 hours and the crowd outside is only getting bigger. The smoke is in the room with us now. It must be a large fire but no one has seen any flames yet. Ben is removing the tiles to the roof so we can escape that way. A few days ago, I had stolen a diagram of the building layout from Doug‚Äôs office to aid my escape. So, if we get up above the ceiling I believe I can lead us out.

I‚Äôve packed everything that could be of use to us--a few first aid kits, some sharp tools, all kinds of meds, and a couple of granola bars. Our goal right now is to make our way to the dinning hall, so we can have food and water if we need to wait this out. Or, at worst, we can steal some car keys from one of the offices over there and get off the property all together. We are just going to have to play it by ear once we get out there and asses the situation. That is, if we make it that far.

Once I got back into doing blow and opiates on the regular though, I noticed that I couldn‚Äôt trip like I used to at all, and could barely even handle two tabs without taking at least a klonopin before and after. I had a series of really bad trips and only drop L a couple times a year these days.

I stopped doing blow regularly too in the past year or so cause my comedowns were getting way too harsh. I also see shadow people and get really bad brain zaps whenever I do more than like 1 cap of molly so I only do that on special occasions as well.

I know for sure that my issues with blow are a result of my lacking dopamine, but could that also be the reason why I can‚Äôt trip like I used to?

Update from yesterday,"A sincere thank you to everybody who offered assistance or kind words to me yesterday, it really meant a lot to me after not having anyone answer a call or text all day to have complete strangers offer to get me there by any means. Seriously, thank you.

 IM SO FED UP WITH THIS SYSTEM! So after freezing my ass off and a two and a half hour journey with no money, in 12 degree weather, i arrived at the assessment center. Ostensibly, to sign the one release THEY FORGOT TO HAVE ME SIGN DAYS AGO when i got the assessment done. Simple right? nah of course not, r/opiates knows how its goes!! Anything that can go wrong will.

 To give a little backround to set the stage, Im 24. been doing heroin since 16 but didnt get really bad until my mom died at 20. I've been through the wringer with this addiction. Rehabs,halfway houses, recovery houses, outpatients,cold turkey in jail, you know how it goes. I'm on probation right now. Anyway, I've been home from jail and living with my dad since July, got a new PO who is honestly pretty great (as far as cops go) she seems to be sympathetic to the cause and wants to help me and not lock me up. Great! The day after Xmas she calls me in. FUCK! hot urine for sure. i was high when she called me, BUT I decided to go against ALL my junkie instincts this time. i didnt run, or lie, or fake the piss test. I walked into her office and admitted that I was using and I needed help. Was expecting to go right to jail, she says you need to go get an assessment and be in rehab tomorrow.(Last wednesday)So that's what i do (prolly the 5th time ive been through the process at this assessment center) they say we will call you when we get a bed for you. Normal stuff so far. HERES WHERE THE FUCKERY BEGINS.

Last friday my dad comes in snapping ""why arent you in rehab yet"" ""youre lying"" ""you prolly never got the assessment"". So i called my insurance company to see when I would have a bed. they said ""We're just waiting on your paperwork to get faxed over from the assessment center SHOULD BE LESS THAN AN HOUR"". Well, the never sent it over and left for the weekend. My PO and My dad are flipping out thinking I'm playing games and stalling for time (not true but I understand their POV) Monday comes and they call me and tell me they messed up and forgot to have me sign some bullshit release form and to come in wednesday(yesterday) and they're very sorry for the mistake but its just as simple as I sign the paper, and the rehab would pick me up......Obviously you guys know what i went through yesterday to get there. I WAS SO HAPPY TO MAKE IT THERE against all my junkie thoughts, and shitty weather and logistical problems. I was proud. Anyway, I ask to see the woman who did my assessment but she refused to see me and had me sign the paper at the front desk. Weird but w.e. I sign the paper and ask when i can expect the rehab to pick me up. She gives me a side eyed look and closes the partition in my face and eventually sends out some other lady who said ""we're sorry but they no longer have a bed for you BECAUSE YOU TOOK TO LONG!!!"" (I'm mildly dopesick at this point and exhausted) I kinda snapped a little and asked for the supervisor or whoever was in charge and sat my ass down, explained the situation and told him I wasn't going to leave unless it was to the rehab lol Had him call My PO and my Dad and explain that I'm doing everything humanly possible to do the right thing and THEY were the ones causing the delays and bullshit. and that if they did what they were supposed to, that i would have gotten into rehab a week ago....Eventually They tell me to go home and they'll call me when the next bed opens up..... So I went home, now fully dopesick... AND WAKE UP THIS MORNING TO SIX INCHES OF SNOW AND NO UPDATE ABOUT REHAB. This got way longer than i wanted it to be but i just had to get it off my chest. IM SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED IVE BEEN FUCKING BEGGING FOR HELP, DOING WHATEVER THE FUCK IT TAKES. they've wasted a fucking week of my life, almost my freedom, a full fucking trek through the artic blast. AND treated me like someone who doesnt matter, who doesn't deserve respect. IM SICK OF GETTING JERKED AROUND BY THESE PEOPLE.

 ""(hEy KeNZo MaYbE YOu ShOULdnT bE A DoPEfIEnD tHeN YoU DoNT hAVe To DeaL WiTH tHIs) ""... Fair point. This situation is 100% my fault, I relapsed, THAT is the root cause of all of this bullshit. I take full responsibility for that. Accepted the consequences, and made the effort to get help. My point is, WHEN SOMEONE BEGS FOR HELP, WHEN ITS FUCKING LIFE OR DEATH. and I PROMISE you it is very much life or death for me right now, the system NEEDS to be better than this. I feel like im in the twilight zone! My dboy never gave me the run around for 8 fucking days, but my county did. I know i sound like a whiny bitch and that this is an absurdly long rant at this point, but this is my life. And if i fucking die before I get help, nobody will lose their job or even bat an eye, or remember my fucking name. WE DESERVE BETTER. I love you guys, thanks for the support.

The events I'm about to describe happened several days ago now, but the effects still have me in a much worse position than before. How I lost my cash and product is going to sound pretty fucking insane and astronomical in its occurance, but that's only because it is. Still 100% bitter, still no chance of getting any of it back from that tweaker ass hoe.

So basically I was runnin around in the skanky city just over the highway doin my thing. At this point I have a horrible predisposition to this city, definitely experienced more trauma than wonder here. It's notorious for immense trap houses and car thievery. Like everyone there is a car thief and there was this big multi-car-jacking case like 9-10 months ago that my homies were involved with and it was fucking nuts, so I'm considering telling that one from for the most part an outside perspective, we'll see. Anyway. I was just going to trap houses, going to people's houses, meeting at 7/11, selling meth, making calls, getting people in touch so I didn't have to do the work, making trades, etc etc. It was very busy at this point, and I was powering through with no sleep on the past 60 hours and maybe 700 calories. I was very light headed, my lips and hands kept going kinda numb, and at one point I thought it safe to assume I was going to pass out. Before going into a trap house I made the connection that these people don't give a singular fuck about me, just my drugs. That's fine by me, but if I do have the misfortune of passing out then these goons are going to run my pockets and throw me out the door. So I stuff my cash and my product in my sock. I've never done this before in my life, but I've seen plenty of people do it. So I go about my excursions and don't pass out. 

After a couple hours I get a text and am being invited to dinner by this family I know. I mainly know the daughter and her cousin who's in town for holiday, her cousin and I go way back and she's leaving town tomorrow. I would like to see her and a change of environment is always nice. So here's the thing about this family... they're like a house whose frame is rotted. Looks great when you're walking up to the door step, step inside still wonderful, but so much as dig a measly fingerpoke in the wall and you see the rot and smell the stench of what it really is. At first glance they look drug free, middle class and happy, but look longer than a first glance can hold and their facade crumbles, and they get angry about it. It's kind of heart breaking honestly. The reality and truth of it is that they all do hella meth, their actions and reactions are entirely based on off the wall, unstable emotions and a construed sense of instinct. They are entirely unstable and unpredictable which can often lead to pointless arguments getting physical. There are two boys who the youngest, the rest are girls. With that context laid out, naturally it's one of those houses where you have to take your shoes off and shit, even though they have hard wood floors so wtf? Not gonna get into that. 

I walk in, hug people, talk loudly to greet whoever isn't in the entry way, and take my shoes off. Well oh fuck wait there's a wad of cash and a bunch of fucking meth sticking out of my sock like the best tumor you could ask for. I have one arm that I can use efficiently and people looking at me, so as subtly as I could I slip those valuable into my shoe while I'm bent down taking them off and moving them, my pocket would have been much too obvious. So we get to the table, eating and bullshitting, mom is runnin around being a Flail-Bot 3000, she's fuckin everywhere clearly gacked out of her mind. Whatever though it's dinner, what do you expect? She leaves the dining room a few times, her constant changing of locations and tasks to not fully complete are beginning to be a background focus to the rest of us. About 45 minutes we hear her call to us from the entry way, she informs she has to go to a bumfuck city in a different county and it's a little over an hour away. It's about 10 at night and she suddenly needs to go this fucking instant. Before anyone even has a chance to respond we hear the door shut and she's in her car. Uuuuuhhhhh. Okay. Right. Sure. What the fuck? 

Now I know this is a fatty wall of text, and I promise I'm sober as I'm writing this, but up in the beginning I used the phrase, ""astromical in occurance."" This is what I mean. The rest of us begin brainstorming/joking about why she would have to leave so suddenly and to that place. The daughter I know best says, ""maybe she found a spider when she was doing her shaking and didn't want to walk past it, so she turned around and went out the door."" I don't know what the hell that means so I ask for elaboration. It turns out when momma gets gacked she starts shaking people's jackets and shoes for fucking spiders. Not even kidding. She doesn't want any in the house and goes to extreme efforts to make sure it is that way. She shakes people's shoes for spiders. I fucking repeat, SHE SHAKES PEOPLE'S SHOES FOR SPIDERS. THAT'S WHERE MY GOD DAMN MONEY AND METH IS. My cash and my Meth is quite literally my lifeline, you can't fuck with that, but she took it all and dipped. I don't even know if I believe what I was told, maybe she knew I had something in my shoe, I don't know, but my god what an unlikely misfortune. Like are you fucking kidding me with that. Yes, it all should have been on my person, that's on me, but this consequence is just overkill. Lesson learned I suppose. She actually has yet to come back to town is what I've been told. I've driven by a few times and her car is never there. 

So yeah there's the spider story. For those who were present for the conversation in which this story was requested, I'm happy to share that my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo is in fact together again, they just needed an adjustment of living arrangement. Which they got. 3 times in one day actually, I didn't help unpack at the new living quarters at the end of the day because at that point it was just excessive.",1515092742.0

These aren't days in a row, but just different days.) 

Day 1: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 8 hours, take five 5mg Hydro. Feel nothing. I assume I didn't wait long enough. 

Day 2 AND 3: Take Kratom at 9am, but instead wait 10 hours. Take five 5mg hydro's. Works perfectly. 

Day 4: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 9 hours, take two and a half 10mg hydro's, feel nothing.

Day 5: Same thing as Day 4. 

So clearly there is SOME antagonist effect of Kratom, but what exactly can I do tonight if I am planning on using the same dose of Hydrocodone, but I took Kratom this morning? Should I wait longer? Is there anything I can do to clear out the antagonists and lower my tolerance? (Magnesium, tumeric, tagament, etc.) 

Should I add a potentiater to the hydrocodone? Should I try crushing up the 10mg hydro's? Should I try fasting before taking the hydro? 

I realize Kratom has antagonists, but as you can see on Day 2 and 3 the hydro worked fine and I took the kratom in the morning, but I took 5mg tablets instead of 10mg ones. So could that have something to do with it? 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to get rid of the Kratom in my system for when I plan to take my hydro tonight?

I went on this big oxy binge last year in like october-november, for like almost 30 days i bought at least one Roxi 30 and just straight ate it no snorting no bullshit. but towards the end i‚Äôd buy like 2 cause one was still getting me high but not high enough. and towards the very very end i‚Äôd buy half an OP 80 just to not be sick for the whole day which would also somehow get me high. at this point i had final projects and shit so i wasn‚Äôt too worried about catching big nods and stuff like that cause i had shit to do also. 

But at the end the roxi man ran out and i literally had to stop cold turkey against my will. So for like 4 days i kept throwing up bile (i‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs bile or stomach acid it was yellow) and i was dry heaving like a motherfucker nonstop. Also i felt like it would never stop. I had cold sweats and I would be hot and cold at the same time.

Thankfully my girl took care of me or i might have tried to jump out my window but this shit was so fucking painful. There was like a long rectangle down the front of my stomach that also would not stop hurting and i could barely stop breathing fast and shallow the whole time, it felt like i could never catch my breath. When i went to take a shit it was damn near liquid each time. I couldn‚Äôt even keep down water and I didn‚Äôt feel like eating shit. but the MOST confusing part is that I didn‚Äôt think eating a roxi would fix anything, if anything i thought i‚Äôd probably yak that up too. 

So my question to you fellas is, how the fuck do i know this was withdrawals or not? Was that just some fucking Flu? Have I still not experienced withdrawals? What the fuck could possibly be worse than that? Just give it to me straight , doc.. 

Naw fr tho that was fucking tough but I can rest 100x easier knowing that that‚Äôs what withdrawals are and that I‚Äôve already experienced them.
