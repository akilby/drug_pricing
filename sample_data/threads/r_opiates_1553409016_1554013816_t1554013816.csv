b7khji,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b7khji/the_army_saved_me/,1,https://redd.it/b7khji,Linkdownc,The Army saved me,"So i have been a lurker on this sub for quite some time. I love everyone's positive attitude and openness and being able to express yourself on a very deep level in something we share so in common with. Its something so much more than surface level and I believe we all relate to that. I have never commented on much or if at all honestly and I dont know why but today I kinda feel like telling my story. (Its way longer than i thought I would type but if your interested go for it)

&#x200B;

I first got introduced to opiates in 2009 as a junior in high, I slammed my face on a box rail snowboarding, went to the ski patrol and they told me I needed to go the hospital cause my pupils were un-equal and that I had a concussion. I denied an ambulance cause of the price and had a friend I went with drive me to the hospital. Well the ER doc was a super chill young guy who snowboarded as well so we got to talking alot about it and to this day I think its the reason he wrote me a script for 90 10/325 norcs lol. I was a huge stoner at the time and hadn't done much other drugs at the time but I was always open to anything. Well little did i know the magic he gave me in that bottle. Holy $hit did I love them. That feeling being wrapped in that opiate blanket is freaking magical. We all know ;\]

&#x200B;

Well I finished that bottle and being a huge stoner I naturally hung out with other herb connoisseurs and open minded friends. I quickly became good friends with a guy, who in my perspective, moved massive amounts of norcos, oxies, roxys, xans, talking like 500-1000 pill deals at a time. We were really good friends and so was a our group. There was a solid ten of us and we all did everything together it wasn't like we were hanging out cause of the drugs. But yea I could get 5 norcs for 10$ back then. God damn that was the golden era, such a great time. Even being so easily accessible I never let myself get too deep with them, I really was a weekend warrior with them. When i did take them I loved them. This was from 2010 to about 2014. 

&#x200B;

Being that opiates are such a strong substance, some of us naturally ventured down the road of heroin. At first I didn't want to do it, I still hung out with the homies that would do it in front of me and we would still just be chillin shooting the shit. This went on for a couple months until one day I got fired from a restaurant job that I didnt even like at all but was still pissed off about it and said fuck it ill try heroin with the homies. I chased the dragon and was a changed person after.  That rush of instant bliss is un like anything else. That part of my brain was unlocked and for the rest of my life it will never be locked. Once you know that feeling there is no not knowing. Well for the next 4 years or so it was like one of my main focuses. I was a pretty good functioning addict. I held a good job for awhile and lived on my own and had my own car and just smoked a little heroin on the side lol. 

&#x200B;

Of course, maintaining that lifestyle of functioning and smoking heroin can only hold up for so long. It takes extreme will power. This past year of 2018 it really went downhill fast. I would start missing work to drive 4 hours one way to pick up dope from the old connect I had in high school. Lieing to an awesome girlfriend I had, going behind her back all the time to smoke. Stealing from her and friends I had made. Never wanting to be social and hang out and party like I used to. Always missing work to pick up, wasted all my money on dope barely affording rent. Basically the same story you hear of someone spiraling out of control and loosing everything. Of course the girl friend found out, came clean to her about it all but it was pretty much too late for all that. I quit my job and moved back in with my parents. 25 at this time btw. Well of course moving back home meant I was close to the plug, so, it all continued, stealing credit cards from my parents, siblings, not being social, not wanting to do anything and just being a huge piece of shit at life. 

&#x200B;

From my perspective I was at rock bottom. I had to find a way out. My dad had wanted me to join the military after highschool but I always said fuck that. At this point I felt like I had no other option. It was either military or end up being kicked out of my parents and everyone abandoning me. So I went to the closest recruiting office and joined the Army. The process of joining is a long one and it took about two months for everything to clear and all the paperwork bullshit that you have to do. I was high on heroin the entire process knowing that itll be the last few months of being able to smoke lol. Of course they have to ask you if you've done any drugs and you have to say no or else get a waiver to join. I said no but little do they know I just hit some foil with heroin in my car 5 minutes before coming in lol. Jokes on them, I was going to enjoy my last few weeks of freedom. Well I got in and shipped off to fort Jackson South Carolina. The first week of reception was absolute fucking HELL. I smoked until the day I left and just cold turkeyd it all through reception. It was fucking hell. No other way to describe it. Started feeling good after a week and it was good timeng cause thats when I started basic training. I gotta say it was one of the hardest most fun things I have experienced. I got through that and now I am in AIT and about to graduate that. For those that dont know AIT is where you are taught how to do the job you chose for the Army. Im a vehicle mechanic so I just finished mechanic school. I got assigned to Hawaii and in 3 days im moving to Hawaii! 

&#x200B;

All in all I really owe my life being turned around by the Army and if I can do it, withdrawing and all, ANYONE can do it. You just gotta have the will power. 

P.S. a buddy of mine got his wisdom teeth and didnt want his script of percocet and gave them to me. Talk about a score. This was about a month ago lol. 

Opiates and heroin especially will always hold a deep spot in my mind and heart. Ill always have a love for them. Happy nodz!!!

My problem is, I don't really know much about this problem I have some background info but I have to frame this controversy as a question and pick a position. I don't know what I want to make as a question?

I was thinking about maybe talking about kratom and saying ""should we use kratom for ..."" and maybe focus on the effects that it can have, but my teacher really likes objective scientific evidence backing behind stuff and I don't know how much of Kratom's healing is backed behind it. My teacher did read michael pollan's how to change your mind, so she is open-minded about drugs to a certain extent.

Anyways, I came to this sub to ask you guys about what you would focus on and what kind of question you would make?

Opioids are an amazing tool, but since the majority of mankind is highly undereducated by way of the intentionally underfunded educational systems all over the globe, that tool ends up being the only way of even feeling accepted by yourself.

From a health and safety perspective, opioids are exceptionally effective and very safe drugs, given the user has been properly instructed.

But if all you're chasing is just an easy escape from constantly being made to feel like you're a loser and nobody wants anything else but your money and your lifeblood, it's quite simple to see how you possibly willfully ignore even the most basic safety measures when using such substances.

You can tell a lot about the state of a society by way of the drugs that its members prefer.

However, I work in the oil patch, in the Appalachian basin. I began to run low on my medicine last night, and figured it wouldn’t be hard to get a script filled somewhere else. Boy, was I wrong two pharmacies told me they “were out of stock” and one mom and pop place told me he wouldn’t fill it because “he was tired of oil field trash like my self ruining his town with our drug addictions”. Anyway, the only place that would fill it was Walmart, they had no discount cards and the ones I found on my phone wouldn’t work. I had to pay completely out of pocket. $167.13 for 30 pills. I got back to the rig and took one, and about 5 minutes later I was in good old precipitated withdrawals, a feeling I haven’t felt in over two years!! The Walmart brand are made by Klerner Urban Pharmaceuticals, and are hexagonal with only a number 8 on them. I had no opiates in my system aside from the CVS suboxone. WTF caused this?? Does the Walmart brand have more naloxone, or does its bupe have a higher affinity for the opioid receptor than the CVS brand? Also, can I return a script? I have another script so I’m not worried if I can’t get the script back, but I would like my money back. I’d like to tell the pharmacist what happened, but I know she wouldn’t believe me.

so today i grabbed a 10 pack of of blues for $300 (i know it’s expensive my state is the one in the US that’s the most concerned about the epidemic i’d say because everyone is on opioids up here) like i always do after a long week of work (56 hours) and i pulled over a little bit down the road to sniff one and i take one out and put the rest back in my sock.. mean while they were wrapped up in a napkin they weren’t in a bag or anything and i didn’t count them because my plug is my best friends dad so i never have to worry/even think about it being short and when i got home i pulled them out to switch them into a bag there was 11 in there!! so i got 12 instead of 10 (: (: (: 

so i get home and this kid calls me and says he needs 2 so i tell him i paid extra this time i have to charge him $50 for one or $90 for two.. hesitantly he agreed lol and came thru and grabbed the 2 for $90.. 

then another guy called and he wanted 3 and i told him i was doing them for $50 a piece but i would do the 3 for $130 ($43 a pop) and once again: reluctantly agreed, came through and copped them for $130 lmfao 

P.S!!! : when i was walking home from meeting the second kid i found a $20 on the ground!!!!! talk about great fucking luck  

so long story short i paid $300 for 10; sold 5 for $220 & found a 20 bill omw home from doing that so i basically sold 5 for $240; i’ve done 2 (e8s my favorite!) and still have 5 left (: 

so i basically paid $80 for 5 blues!!!! (3 e8s & 2 ALGs)

solid ass day if you ask me! happy and safe nods my opi brothers & sisters enjoy your Saturday nights my friends! shoot it sniff it eat it smoke it boof it!! LOL

Lupus patient Hydromorphone and Morphine question,"First off thank you all. I have learned a lot and continue to do so from the members of this forum.   


I am an old guy compared to many of you and have been dealing with Lupus and other Chronic Illnesses that cause a lot of pain for almost 30 years.   


My old doctor moved out of state and my new one is just moving in so I have had a couple of dry spells here and was forced to look elsewhere to make up the difference as I am in the middle of a Lupus flare so I am taking more than my prescription on top of having the two delays. One last month and one this week.   


I was no angel growing up and have no issue with people getting fucked up on whatever they choose, but I find it pretty disgusting that anyone would make fake medicine.   


Luckily for me there are the test strips to check and I had one batch that almost fooled me!  


And again l got lucky when I told a friend of mine who also deals with chronic pain about what happened with the fake pills and she sent me a care package.   


1. I dont do needles. I have done just about every drug under the heavens that did not require a needle other than Heroin and that is probably why I never did Heroin. 
2. There are mornings when I do snort an Oxy. Sometimes I wake up in so much pain I cant wait for it to kick in orally.   


She sent me some ER 10MG Morphine, along with some 4 mg hydrophone and some percocets.   


My normal is 3-4 Oxy a day and usually I dont take it to get fucked up but I have been known to pop one and snort one and just chill on the couch for the afternoon/evening.   


So is there a way to make the 10mg Morphine actually put me on the couch for a while? I have never done the Dillys before, and have read about boofing or snorting.   


About the Dillys 4 mg. Should I just start with 2 mg? I dont want a headache, as I have enough aches already. I have read extensively about boofing them and I never even knew that was a real thing.   


Sure I had some buddies that liked to give drugs to their girls that way but I thought it was just a fetish thing but now it all  makes sense.   


From what I gather on this board it is only necessary to get it in 1 cm rectally before I depress the plunger. Anything I need to watch out for?  


Is it really that much more effective than snorting or orally?  


Thank You for helping an old guy out.

Val could tear me to shreds or be something from a dream. Being across from her always made my muscles tense, ready to run, but, not sure where. As usual, tonight was no different.


It was trivia night at the Alehouse and we huddled close together over our answer sheet. Neither of us knew any of the answers, but it didn't matter. We were both drunk and more importantly, I was high.


A few nights ago I saw my dealer, the Mechanic. I parked at the usual gas station, popped the hood, and acted like I was trying to fix my car. When  he came up to help I slid over $160 and he dropped 10 20mg Roxys in my cup holder. 


By tonight I was down to 4 pills but that was good enough with my mix. 60mg ephedrine, 10mg Adderall, 2mg Klonopin, four drinks, and 60mg of Oxycodone induced bliss. It was needless to say, I was having an amazing time. 


Everything was just right, the uppers had me engaged, laughing and talking. The GABAergics freed me from my doubt and worry about tomorrow's problems, and the Oxy washed over me in immaculate feeling of confidence and euphoria.


Val knew but she didn't care, she knew I loved being high, and I loved her when I was high.


When I got up to go get us more drinks, Val grabbed me gently to pull me in for a kiss. We had our own language, a quick peck meant more drinks. Deep and passionate was our let's get out of here signal, but this was just a peck.


Coming back with another Red Oak and Val's mixed drink, she watched me ready to pounce. I traded her drink for a kiss with a playful bite chaser.


“You wanna go outside for a smoke?” I asked, while unconsciously feeling for my last pill.


“Yeah let's go out” she said, casting her spell over me.



Outside I opened my pill container breaking my last Roxy in two. I gave half to Val and chewed the other.


“So how's life been?” I asked pointing to her with my cigarette.


“Well after Johnathan left I kinda shut down, but I'm doing better now.  Working for my family isn't that bad… Life's just hard, ya know?”


“Oh I know Val, life's hard and nobody makes it out alive.” I said, placing my hand on her thigh.


“But you know I'm always here for you right?”


“I know you are” she replied gently grabbing my hand and looking in my eyes.


After we finishing our drinks I could see the opiate euphoria growing inside her. Gentle touches and conversation morphed into double entendres and deep biting kisses.


With constricted pupils and wearing a subtle grin she whispered. “I don't have neighbors anymore, wanna come over?”


“Lead the way” I said exhaling one last breath of nicotine into the spring air.


Val laughed as I tried to be a gentleman opening her door, “you do know you're already gonna get laid right?”


I laughed saying, “yeah, well it never hurts”.


“No, no it doesn't” 



Two hours later I basked in the glow of my own high, while Val traced her fingertips across my chest in a V. She always did mark her concurred prey...

By 19 I was shooting up because I couldn't afford my smoking habit anymore and my lungs were getting destroyed. At 21 I got on suboxone and it actually worked for me and I got two years clean off of heroin. I felt amazing and honestly after a couple months I hardly ever even got cravings anymore. Well I'm 23 now and I went to inpatient in February to finally get off the subs because I just didn't have the willpower to quit on my own. Something happened in treatment though and my urge to do heroin came back, hard. It was all I could think about. So I relapsed. First when I got out I met up with a guy I met in treatment and I started smoking those pressed fentanyl 30's. I became frustrated though because the high didn't last long and it made me feel really sick after. So I met up with another gentleman I met in treatment and I started slamming heroin again. So I basically went on a month long dope binge and spent all of my money, I'm unemployed now, I sold one of my favorite guns, I've stolen a few hundred bucks from my girlfriends bank account, and now I'm in a different city with my girlfriend's family where I don't know anybody and I'm sick as fuck. I got some Kratom to help with the withdrawals but it's not doing much. I'm just so frustrated that I had so much clean time and I've pissed it away and I'm right back where I started. I seriously just want to grab one of my guns and blow my brains out I don't want to live like this and I don't want to struggle anymore.

We've known each other for a few years. I've been in love with her for a long time, one of those deals where you think you've got the world by the balls, you're finally catching a break. But she is bipolar as fuck.

She lives next door to a couple who she used to be in a kind of weird three-way relationship with. The girl just got knocked up recently and has been doing all kinds of drugs and drinking in an attempt to have a miscarriage on purpose we're pretty sure. Fucking scumbag but I digress. 

My girl has been distant the past week, constantly ""not feeling good"" and just acting weird. I'm pretty positive she's just using me as a stepping stone because I've got a car, a job, etc. Not to mention the fact that I keep her well with subs, and help take care of her three kids who she does not take care of like she should. Her apartment was a wreck before I came along and helped her clean, and then trained her dog for her. 

Last night she was over doing adds with the weird ass neighbors and came over and started cutting her 5 yr olds hair at 930 at night with her eyes bugging tf out. The kid was crying because she just wanted to go to sleep. Then she puts hair dye in her hair and leaves again for another hour without telling me where she's even going which she does constantly. She came back at like 11 and woke the kid up to wash the dye out of her hair that should have been washed out 45 minutes ago. 

Then she runs back out the door again and doesn't come back. I went over and knocked on the door and the chick over there said yeah shes in the back getting a tattoo done. I said thanks and shut the door and went back to the apartment. Woke up this morning and she still hadn't come back. 

I don't know what the fuck to do. I do love this girl but she's a fucking mess. Her kids are starting to resent her and are constantly worried the state's going to step in and take them away again. They were in foster care for more than a year while she went away to a long term program. 

I'm not looking for advice really, the only smart advice would be to gtfo of here. I just don't know. I love her kids and they love me but I'm not going to be disrespected like that. Sorry for the long ass post but I needed to get this off my chest. To anyone who read the whole thing, I love you and hope you are atleast well on this shit rainy day. Peace. ",1553958063.0

You cannot make this shit up. Unbelievable that I wasted all this money.  Still grabbing the dillys today, as they are 100% real and safer than these fent pressed pills. I am not sure what to do with the 30s as I spent a nice chunk of change on them. I could keep them for myself for a long time or I can throw away a couple of thousand dollars and destroy them to ensure nobody ever gets hurt from these pieces of garbage. 

There is no excuse for my ignorance in purchasing them, and it is all my own fault. I am disappointed in my plug for trying to sell them to me as real as we did have a sort of good business relationship, but the only person I can truly blame is myself. 

Again, just wanted to say thank you to all of         /r/opiates  for commenting on my original post. It most definitely prevented a tragedy and for that I thank each and every one of you.

It’s almost 7 am where I’m at. I’m 18 and live at home with my parents. 

I’m lying in bed when my Dad comes bursting through my bedroom door yelling at me, saying he had 20 pills of hydrocodone left in his pill bottle when he went to bed, and now he’s woken up and there’s only 2 left. His go to is to accuse me of stealing them. I will be completely honest and say I did not take them. In fact I didn’t even know he had them. I’ve never touched his shit but he’s absolutely sure it was me, even though I have two people to vouch for me and say I wasn’t even out of bed when this allegedly happened. Long story short he keeps bitching at me, threatening to kick me out if I don’t hand them over. I repeatedly tell him “I’m sorry but I didn’t touch them. You probably misplaced them.” 

Apparently that wasn’t enough. He’s called the police and is filing a report against me for shit I didn’t do. What the fuck do I do now? I mean, if we’re being honest here, both of my parents buy hydrocodone illegally, so I don’t know wtf he was thinking when he got the fucking police involved. Obviously if I get drug tested, I will fail, but the drugs in my system weren’t obtained from him or his prescription. I’ve never stolen a damn thing from the dude. I guess I’m just venting because I have no idea what the fuck is going to happen. I’ll see y’all in a holding cell, I guess. Fucking hell. ",1553953668.0

I had a year of clean time and I fucked it by going back to the codeine. It sucks, but there we are.

So I had tried countless times in the past 10 months to taper but of course I was never successful because Bad Aileen (yes, I’ve named the addict in me) had total control. 

But I have exciting shit coming up. I’m getting married in 3 months. My partner and I want to start a family. I need to be healthy and clean so I can be a present participant in my own damn life. 

I was watching Gilmore Girls the other day and Taylor (of all characters) said something that resonated. He said, on discussing pain killers, that ‘Pain is just your body’s way of saying I am not okay now, but I will be later. You don’t want your body to be too closed down. Because then you’re just dead’. 

And holy shit that just struck a chord! So I went to my GP, got prescribed gabapentin to help with the rls, and I just...stopped.

Seriously, I owe a lot of this to the gaba. I have been going in to work, shaky and uncomfortable, but no where near as bad as I would have been without the gaba. I even had left over codeine in my bag and I didn’t even look at it once. I’ve never had self control like it. 

Here is my issue though. Last night, on day 4, I felt massively worse. This is weird because usually day 3 is the hardest. I had to put my gloves on and fight with Aileen the entire night, I was so desperate for relief. I was having rls despite the gaba and felt unbelievably cold and sweaty.

This morning on day 5 I woke up the same. Any clues? Why it the timeline of this a little off?

I am praying I don’t slip up today. I will be devastated if I do. Just clinging on by the finger tips right now.

Fast forward almost 7 years of near constant pain, inability to do so much as even jog a quarter mile without it popping out of place and having me on the ground writhing in pain, I’m finally in the process of getting the 
surgery.

I’m beyond stoked to be at 100% again, but this poses a question.
Now, I’m just over 15 months clean off dope, and about 7 months off suboxone. 
According to my father, who’s had both acl’s reconstructed from various sporting injuries, the pain after will be quite immense for at least a few weeks.

But, this is 2019, and I’m unsure if the office I’m seeing knows of my drug addict past (I decided to lie on the new patient forms and say no about that), but I don’t know how medical records work.

Do y’all think they’ll give me anything worthwhile for the pain?
My dad says I’ll most likely get a script of 40 perc 10’s with a single refill.
I’ve never gotten anything better than 800mg motrin aside from twice in my life, the original acl tear, and a dislocated shoulder when I was 12.

Sorry for the typos, I shake from arthritis so I mess up some of the spelling. 
  


So, I'm just going to say this (her name deleted) , you have really hurt my feelings. I felt like we were getting to be close friends, I really smiled when you said we were girlfriends because I don't have many friends and I try to cherish the ones I do have but getting ghosted is the most disrespectful way to end a friendship. I can deal with friends owing me money, but now I feel like you just stole from me and decided to say fuck heather. Hell, telling me to fuck off would have been better than nothing because I was worried maybe you didn't get home safely, then after 3 days of nothing I kinda felt like maybe you just really didn't care about being friends with me at all. I am so stupid and naive to think I could have been friends with another user who just took advantage of me so I've learned my lesson. Please contact (my hubbys name) about the money you owe to work something out. I really do hope you are successful with the suboxone. I will miss being friends with you because we did have a lot of laughs together and your kiddos are awesome. Good luck and good bye.

We didn’t see each other much after that and then lost all contact for years.   When I saw her yesterday I had her get in my car and was hoping she could just middle for me.   Instead she said just buy me a 50 bag of hard and I’ll give you my plug.      This gal used to be married to a Mexican importer and she has legit connects.      I am on mmt and having a good plug is interesting.  I wonder if I can just use my new source to make a little money to pay off my medical bills that have gone to collections and court and now garnishing my paychecks.    

What do you guys think, should I burn the number or try and manage to pay off my debt??

UPDATE:   Omg I hit the jackpot!!!    Got introduced to a New Mexican plug for black and white.  I only had to buy the middle a 40 of hard and some cash for a pack of smokes.        Dealer is super chill, prices are excellent and the gunpowder bth is so light and “fluffy” and this ecp tan color.     Got a ball of legit high quality product for an amazing price.

b6su8s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b6su8s/fuck_my_life/,8,https://redd.it/b6su8s,kasualkruelty,Fuck my life,"So I’ve been using opiates on and off for around 10 years. I went to treatment last March (not the first time by far), but things seemed somewhat different after this time. I made several good friends, and was in a very relaxed sober house where the only rule was basically “don’t get high”. I ended up getting a girl pregnant who, after three months, decided to go MIA and was found after three days shooting dope with her ex and soon after got an abortion. I had been sober for about the last four months after a brief run due to that incident.
     

Fast forward to now, was with a girl the last four months, who I told from the jump I didn’t want to be serious with, and just didn’t have those type of feelings for, and it wasn’t fair to her, but she continued to want to “hang out”.  Me not wanting to be boyfriend/girlfriend finally got to her, she also caught me relapsing and this combination caused her to snap. 
     

She told me I would never see her again, i said ok, then she took “her” tv (she gave it to me for helping her move apartments), and told me I couldn’t have any of my belongings in her car or house. Being a little annoyed I said “ok then I’m taking your shoe”. And took the shoe out of her bag to be a jerk. 
     

Upon taking the shoe she snapped and ran at me clawing and slapping me, I brushed her off, not even a shove, and she immediately started screaming that i hit her. She also happens to be “best friends” with what was my only real friend around here. I have had a hard time making guy friends after my best friend died and he truly was my best friend, but they were friends first and for longer and apparently he was more loyal to her.
     

So he calls me five minutes after she leaves screaming at me that i hit said girl, and he is going to beat my ass, and get me fired (we also work together and he is the main reason I still have a job after my relapse) etc etc. I tried to explain I didn’t touch her and would never hit her, but since I “lied to him about using and she has never lied to him” he believes her. She has also called several other “friends” of mine after the incident in an attempt to turn them against me.
     

He still believes I hit her and will no longer speak to me. It just really sucks because I have a problem with isolating and many years of drug use and self isolation have led to me not having very many friends. This was the first time I had normal friends who we would do normal things together and it feels like it all just came crashing down. I’m not sure if I’m looking for advice or just to rant, but I’m pretty sad right now, and it makes me want to just isolate again and that theres no point in even having friends. It’s all just so discouraging, today I was replaced for tennis me and friend in question and two other friends would be weekly for example. Thanks for listening.",1553833015.0

TLDR: I kinda got in a tiff w a friend who is a gay Male about 40 who lost his partner to dope q couple years ago - they were together for a while...6+ years? Idk, I guess I thought he would click better w what I was trying to say bc hes expressed how coworkers of 10+ yrs still treat him diff bc hes openly gay (not trying to say that sexuality is something you can condition [wtf technically isnt that what the drugs do as per re-wiring?!] ) but obvi it's not innate bc the drugs are supplemented to enhance/downplay chemical where as feelings are more nature....(?) (Holy fuck I'm on a roll stop me now... time to go back to school)

***TLDRx2 - me apologizing to my gay buddy about yelling at him bc he doesnt truly understand why us as addicts continue to spiral (his partner ODd n he cant accept why his love couldnt pull him out) 




I would rather say this in person... however, I am sorry that I yelled at you... but there is something that people who arent in or have not experienced a ""full addiction "" dont understand that when someone is in it - they will choose the drug x292848ru390woeu807 times over anything else - it's just what it does when one is engulfed in it - regardless if they have a soul mate or children or others to live for ---- the brain rewired itself to pick the reward center of the instant 

(**immediate & comfortable constant & full knowledge of outcome ---- an instant high or death -- and at an addicts current *mental health* we happily choose either bc they are numbing and we do not want to feel failure, less than, etc etc so we choose an entire upper/downer high OR eternal darkness - the latter often is more appealing bc it will not drag others thru years [or ourselves] of torment)

 chemical rather than the natural ones (slow process - ups and downs - uncomfortable- unknown of what the future is - with addiction we know the outcome - constant disappointment n regret , failure / death -- and to us at that time it is EASY. it's a fucking cheap way out.... it really is. We are afraid to grow,  we are afraid to fail so we'd rather condemn ourselves to do so bc that way we have ""control "" or ""power"" over it.... at some point in time people who turn towards drugs have gotten lost and no longer believe that they are in control of their own lives bc someone told them that or a traumatic event that has caused a stopping point in development--- our voice, our power, our strength has been stripped...... and then we dig..dig..dig...digggggggg --- until we no longer believe we can climb out alone OR with help bc the hands trying to lift us often have not been in the same holes... yes similar ones but as addicts we like to think we are special and NO ONE is like us (when in reality we are all the same,  just flesh n blood tryna figure this thing called life out n we are all delt different hands, it's just how we play em). OMGG I'm sorry for writing a fucking novel it's just.... it's hard to grow when you fake a smile n cant let it out for fear of judgement for who you are or what you've been thru... an I'll get super fuckin emotional bc like we said outside we are either always smiling at work (if we are able) n then just frowning the rest of the time.... ugh fuck.

 So it's like be a robot n be ""loved"" or be an emotional 'psycho ' & be ""that person"". Its like I was tryin to tell Carrie's husband.... it does not matter about the political parties in control (he was like ""yeah vote Republican n I was like f.u. I do side w them more than u think) --- it comes down to big pharma n them selling us ALLLLLLLLLLL this shit to ""fix us"" or ""better us"" or to ""improve us""  ----- when really  we have majority of the control  (but again... we all have our issues n ailments but isnt it kinda ironic how those who 'believe' they will do/get better end up doing so bc they thought it an thus it turned into an action n a forward moving of matter rather than someone who just sat waiting for the inevitable?).  





And then I wrapped up the text with I'm tired etc etc --- I'm proud tho bc I ALWAYS go back an re-write things so that I sound better or people will agree more... fuck that, that's how I felt, I gotta let that shit out or else it will consume me.

1 week clean of dope. On 1mg sub per day. Shootin coke bc the needle stole my sole. About to sell this last g n block the kids # I middle for.

My life is worthy.

On top of that, I just moved back in with my rents after living on my own for 5 years.

I kept telling myself I’d do it, but then I would still use. I tapered down over the last 8 days and for 24 hours I’ve been completely opiate-free. 

What really helped was reading a comment someone made on a post here. It was something to the effect of, “you have to stop thinking about it all the time - stop fantasizing about using.”  I realized that I was using at times that I didn’t even need it. I just did it because I was in the habit of doing it and had access to it. Even as my tolerance went up and I wasn’t getting the rush that I once did. 

The hardest part was tapering.  Using, but feeling absolutely nothing from it. I knew I needed to do it so my body/mind didn’t go into ultra-pain mode, but that was the hardest. 

The past 24 hours have been surprisingly easy.  Every time I felt like using, I just remember that comment, “don’t think about it!”  A big part of my use was just constantly obsessing about it or using during moments of boredom. Instead I did some deep breathing, and thought about how healthy I will be with a break. 

Every time I’ve stopped using, all the color comes back to my face, I have energy through the roof, and my testosterone comes back giving super boners.

I know it’s not going to always be easy, but I’m really trying to ride this positive momentum I’ve got. When it’s rough, I’ll do the following...

-Remeber how good I’ll look & feel as I get myself more & more clean. 
-Do deep breathing and meditate on my goals... not obsess on “not using,” but instead focus on how good things are going to be. 
-Do stretching, push-ups, flex & releases for if/when my body feels agitated. 
-Hydrate like crazy. 
-Keep treats in the house as rewards for being clean. I’ve been drinking kombucha, having little cookies & cakes on hand as a “reward” for being clean. 
-Know that being able to face my problems (big or small) sober is a HUGE accomplishment for me and each one I conquer I feel like my own personal Superman. 
-Keeping melatonin & chamomile on hand for moments of insomnia should they arise. 

I don’t intend on stopping permanently, but my goal is to take a 30 day tolerance break. If I get there, and feel like I can keep going... maybe I will?  I hope if you’re in the same boat, that you can do it too. If you have any tips that helped you, I’d be happy to hear them. ",1553800978.0

b6m9uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b6m9uq/addiction_rant/,14,https://redd.it/b6m9uq,liverdamage176,Addiction rant,"Sometime during the previous semester of community college I kind of moved in with my friend and he was taking me to class everyday. We started using opiates, Vicodin, Tramadol, Codeine, Oxy, as well as a slew of other pills when we couldn’t get painkillers, and I went overboard with it and used way more than he even knew about. I took pills from someone who really needed them, I always tried to justify it because he is physically abusive to his kids but at the same time I took so many that he ran out and had horrible withdrawals where he had to stay home from work and basically lie in bed all day. At first I was still going to school, albeit I would wake up and eat pills before leaving for class, but then I just dropped out.

After the semester was over I moved back in with my parents, I’m 18, and my parents never knew that I dropped out or that I was abusing drugs. Every like three or four weeks now I take opiates but the only reason I don’t take them as much any more is because I don’t have as much access to them.

Now this semester started, in January or something and I’ve been going like normal with no one the wiser that I dropped out of all my classes last semester. My parents are very supportive of me and all the lying to them really destroyed me. I always blamed the fact that I fucked off all my classes on the heavy opiate usage but now I’ve just been dropped from my Spanish class because I missed so much and, like I said, I only use once or twice a month now.

So now I don’t have addiction to blame for my fuckups and am realizing I’m a spineless loser, literally every day though I crave oxy and hydro and would honestly take anything over being sober. No real point to this post I just have no one to talk to about it and the guilt is killing me.

At least I’m getting like 15 Vicodin 10s tomorrow. ",1553797041.0

My back up plan if that doesn’t work will be going to urgent care afterwards claiming the dental procedure pain is too much, or claiming I might have a kidney stone.

So last time I tried 15 mg oxycodone with more tha a liter of grapfruit juice and felt nothing but nausea. So I was wondering if all those endorphins increased my tolerance because they too bind to opioid receptors.

TL:DR: do endorphins released by physical activity and pain might increase opioid tolerance ?

San Francisco has tried to do supervised injection, but politically it is infeasible - no neighborhood wants to attract bunch of addicts potentially committing petty crime to buy their drugs. Land is also very expensive in the city so it is hard to efficiently help a lot of people.

I was wondering that if it was put in a cheaper place outside of the city, would people sign up to live there if they provided heroin. Putting it somewhere else would mean that we could help more people, and avoid the same political gridlock preventing them from being built in the city (could bribe whatever place we put it in).

I was considering taking one owards the end of my shift but thought it would be wiser to take it later at home.  Got me thinking though...should I even take the whole tab?

But what I was wondering about is what about people in the hospital who are hooked up to iv fluids all day? Like wouldn't their arm be basically numb after that much fluid going into their arm, if mine is only aching after banging like 8 times in one day?

The second thing I'm confused about is I recently had an endocarditis scare, I had a couple of the symptoms which really scared me but it only lasted a couple days and Im feeling fine now. I was pretty confused about it though because I practice pretty good harm reduction. Always use a fresh needle, make sure the iv site is clean, ECT. But what got me wondering was, what about the junkies in the late 19th, early 20th centuries? I've read that there was a pretty big heroin epidemic at that time, and I mean wasn't that before people even knew what germs and bacteria was? Wouldn't junkies be dying off from Endo and other infections left and right?

I cut contact with every single person who knows me and moved across the country.
     
In the last few months I have gone through alot of serious changes to put it nicely. I thought that where I was in life a year ago was essentially on top of the world. If you would have asked me I would have said that I had everything I ever wanted and more.

     I got a hard reality check when my closest friend got killed right in front of my face and I barely escaped the situation with my own life. After a few months of running and hiding in hotels and on the road, I went to rehab for 3 months to combat the crippling heroin addiction I had acquired almost without even thinking about it. Coming to terms with reality and the facing the facts that I was a piece of shit and completely out of touch with reality was the most challenging thing I have ever experienced  

     Afterwards I got a real job making good money and tried to live a normal “American dream” style of life.  Within a few months of this I fell into a deep depression and started doing heroin again once or twice a week to “decompress”. Within the last 2 weeks I took a step back and realized I was quickly regressing into the way I was before I decided to get my life together. 

     I decided to get a new job doing something I enjoy and started maintaining a strict diet and exercise routine to occupy my mind.  Since then I have never felt better about myself. I know it has only been a few weeks but I am beyond excited to start this new chapter of my life.  It feels like I have finally moved on.",1553735517.0

But a few weeks ago, I purchased a bunch of oxy 40s and crushed em all and snorted them using a pestle and mortar. But the problem with my pestle and mortar is that it's quite rocky so sometimes there's residue from pills that I simply cannot get back.

&#x200B;

Now today I felt very shitty from a coke all-nighter with a friend and needed something to take the edge off and I thought to myself, ‘‘Oh, maybe there's a way I can get high from the residue from the oxy I got 2 weeks ago’’. The very simple solution to get access to the residue was to wash it with water and scratch as hard as I could with a spoon to make sure all the residue powder from the oxy goes in the water. And then guess what, I drank it (it was disgusting by the way) and now I'm high as a kite.

I have read a few posts suggesting different methods so I decided to combine a few to see if it does anything. I have a decent tolerance to oxycodone IR already (40-50mg) but I only used 27 mg of xtampza and it had my nose itching like I used to get when I first started opiates, way stronger high. So much so, that I am only going to do 18 mg nxt time.
Here is my method that worked:
Empty capsules into gingerale lemonade, heat in microwave for 1 min 30 sec. Put in freezer for 10 min and then moved to the fridge for 2 hours. At this time it had a solid block of substance on the top, I broke this up in the gingerale and SWALLOWED it. It works great. I tried just putting it in coke for 12 hours before this and it only worked slightly, so I think I've really caught on to something.

Long story short, I am in my mid-30s and have 1 herniated and 2 bulging discs in my lower back likely stemming from a bad deadlift 4 years ago and prolonged sitting at a desk. I am a teacher during the school year and work in the trades during the summers. 

&#x200B;

I basically got through it the first three years with half-assed exercise/PT, moderate discomfort, epidural injections, ibuprofen, and about 60 5mg hydrocodone (doctor) and 30 5 mg oxycodone (stepfather, given not stolen) **annually**. 95% I never took over 5mg in a day and the longest stretch where I took it daily was around 20 days. I have never had any symptoms of withdrawal besides some mild irritability for a day after a longer stretch. These very tight restrictions were to stave off potential dependency and a pragmatic approach to spacing out the limited access.  Not to mention the fact that I enjoy the mild high over the strong ones. I took 10mg at once only one time and absolutely hated it.   


Like many, the 60 5mg of hydrocodone was at first lessened to 30 annually a year ago and then completely cut off the last time I visited the doctor in December. Lo and behold, a winter of increased sitting, I throw my back out shoveling snow and then again 2 weeks later pulling my pants on. As such, most of the 5mg oxycodone was used up. 

&#x200B;

Now, being a loner and being someone in my 30s, I really didn't know where to look for a dealer, but I found one and paid a pretty penny for a bunch of 30 mg ""blue"" oxycodones. Although seemingly very well known to the people on this sub, these were 100% foreign to me. Concerned about the MGs and unable to really break up a tiny pill into 6 equal parts, I ground 2 up very fine, added it to 6 grams of powdered lion's mane mushrooms/corn starch, mixed as best I could, and have been taking .5 g of the mixture with the same restrictions as before.   


Now, the ""high"" and relief from this is very similar to my experience with the 5mg hydrocodone/oxycodone. Decent pain relief, mild euphoria for a bit 3 hours, mild fog and sleepiness for about 3 more. But my god the next day is fucking awful. Even with a prescription to Vyvanse, it takes me HOURS to break through the fog. I feel irritable and ""rushed"" through my morning routine.   


**TL:DR: So my question is; is there something different about the contents, effects, delivery system, whatever of the 30 mg ""blues"" vs the 5mg whites?** ",1553694325.0

It’s like “this didn’t happen, you’re gonna feel alright all by yourself, you didn’t just take a pill” and all that and I even get up to go piss in the middle of the night and pop pills without thinking about it.

I had codeine cough syrup when I was young (8-12). I started smoking weed around 12, stopped that, and was sober until around 15 were I had my first experiences with diverted oxy, norcos, Vicodin etc. 

I always idolized and loved Kurt Cobain, and I felt a connection because of being a musician who is also severely depressed. By 16 I had done a lot of different drugs and I was itching to try heroin.
 I ran with an older crowd, so it wasn’t hard to find (not easy either). I did h once a year until I was 19 in my sophomore year at uni when I caught a habit using #3 from the DNM. I kicked after a month and only used kratom and pills for a couple years. 

Here I am now in the one of the worst times of my life (past 6 months) in chronic pain and severe depression/bipolar. I’ve been sniffing and shooting #4 and tar on and off since January to keep me from wanting to kill myself. Ironic huh?

My buddy used to shoot up fentanyl and still slams coke every weekend.

So I'm kicking and super irritable and I'm basically cut off til I pay the 200 back to my plug.

We make our way to the tunnel to fix...

My buddy thinks he knows everything, he pours out half of his 40 sack of fent which is about 0.2. He hasn't done ANY opiates in years. I told him that is not a good idea, of course his dumb ass doesn't listen (he had been drinking all night as well and was still drunk) he fixed and slammed. He smiles and his back slams against the wall and he say's ""there is is,"" while falling on his ass, still sitting up... I ask if he's ok, of course he's not ok he just slammed fentanyl and is basically opiate naive, and has alcohol in his system. He completely falls out, He's a big cornfed whiteboy, and I'm not too small myself (6' 200lb) and I started dragging his ass by his arms out of the tunnel. He was just too heavy and by that point, when the light hit his face after coming half way out of the tunnel, I noticed he was already turning purple.  I checked his pulse.. he had a pulse but he wasnt breathing. I did chest compressions. Nothing. I had no choice but to call 911.

Is it normal to get what feels like Jolts through your body at any given time? 

Also my blood pressure has been pretty low since taking the Oxycodone. I didn’t know if it was the medicine causing my blood pressure to be low or just having surgery recently.

But the scariest thing is the Jolts through the body suddenly. Also if something loud on TV or in my room happens it makes me jump. Which stuff like that has never bothered me.  


Also a side note I take benzos with my pain medication.

My spine doc gave me a small script for tylenol with codeine (30 mg) and told me to cut them in half and see how it goes. My concern is the mixing of an opiate, benzo, and barbiturate. My pharmacist said it's perfectly fine but I'm still too afraid to take them all together because everything I read just talks about CNS depression and death. I'm not going to abuse any of my medications and I'm using them for legit reasons. If taken at the prescribed doses will I have any side effects other than being extra drowsy?

It’s been a few months now, I started in the fall.  He decided to “start with low dose Norco” so I’ve had 5mg for a few months.  I want to increase the dosage but not sure how to broach it best.

Specifically - I hate the appointments because they ask me to rate myself from 1-10 for pain at the moment, the worst it was this month, how much the medicine helps (more or less than half the pain, etc.) and I always feel like I didn’t communicate myself well.

Like if I say my pain is a 7 and the medicine takes it down to a 3 is that better or worse than saying 7 to 5? Better meaning more conducive to a slight increased dose.

I know I should just be honest but I have such a hard time explaining my pain that way.  Stubbing your toe really hurts but only for a few seconds while my pain fluctuates and is mostly constant.  I feel like I have to play the game at pain management and I overthink it maybe.  I always feel very aware that I could say something wrong or that they could stop prescribing at any time so it’s bad for my anxiety.

My dosages for other opiates are as follows. 4-8mg of IV Hydromorphone. 80mg IV oxy. .2-.3 IV black tar depending on purity. 

I shot 5mg of opana and got an AMAZING rush, but literally no high. It is just like dilaudid there is only a rush no nod or buzz afterwards. I shot 8mg today and same thing. No high, but an INTENSE rush. I am scared to go any higher with the dosage because all of the calculators and conversions I do tells me that 5mg should be plenty to get me high. 5mg should be equivelant to about 100mg of oxy. 

So why cant i catch a nod off these? Are they not as strong as the conversion calculators say they are?

For those that've tried it/know more about it, what's the duration? Can it be vaporized/smoked? Are oral and insufflated worth while ROA'S? 


Info on the drug:


Etonitazene is a potent analgesic drug first reported in 1957[1] which has been shown to have approximately 1000–1500 times the potency of morphine in animal models, but only 60 times in man. [1]


It has been suggested that etonitazene is the most addictive substance on the planet. As an opioid, it exhibits 1,500 times the potency of morphine, but it’s also a stimulant on par with ecstasy. Basically, it’s a molecular speedball. Although etonitazene has appeared as a street drug on a few occasions, the vast majority of the world’s supply is consumed by mice and monkeys in addiction studies. Scientists know that rhesus monkeys lick their little furry lips with delight when you spike their water dish with etonitazene, but monkeys like a lot of shit, and as the old saying goes, never send a rhesus monkey to do a man’s job.


Thomas Highsmith worked at a prestigious laboratory in Salt Lake City designing low-friction laminates for high-performance skis. In 2003, he started spending long nights in his lab secretly manufacturing a personal supply of etonitazene. Shortly after completing the synthesis, he became hopelessly addicted. He would show up for work clutching a 12-ounce spray bottle of etonitazene and fiendishly snort it throughout the day. Over the course of a couple of months, his tolerance escalated to the point where he was taking 300 times his starting dose. A coworker became suspicious of Highsmith’s odd behavior and reported him to the police. His etonitazene supply was seized, and he was prescribed methadone to combat the withdrawal. At that point, his addiction equated to 500 bags of heroin a day, and the methadone umbrella did nothing to deflect the 10,000-pound etonitazene anvil hurtling toward his head. Highsmith never received a criminal sentence because he was found dead in his home before his first court date. The withdrawals were so severe that he had killed himself to escape the pain.

Please forgive, as this is my first ever post here. 

Let's get to the meat. 

I've been in pain management since 2015 for psoriatic arthritis, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, foramenal stenosis, and a few other physical pains/situations. I began with hydrocodone 10mg x 3 times a day and stayed there for a very long time without issues, the opioids were working wonders, and I was able to actually go to work and enjoy my job again. 

Suddenly, I noticed the hydro wasn't working as well anymore, and I had anticipated this, knowing all about tolerance, as I've dealt with it in using other meds. After graduating to 20mg 3x day, my doctor then switched me to oxycodone at the same dose. 

Again, this worked very well, and I was back at work and able to handle 14 hour days without issue as long as I had my opes. 

Suddenly, out of seemingly nowhere, about three weeks ago, the opes stopped working. At first, I thought it was an issue of tolerance again, so I upped the dose to 25mg. Nothing. 30mg. Nothing, except fatigue, which does not happen to me with opes. 

I'm simply not willing to go any higher of a dose than that, it feels stupid and dangerous. 

But, after thinking maybe it was hormonal or related to neurotransmitters, I've taken a host of nootropics and supplements to no avail. My dose remains 20mg 3x day, oxycodone. 

Here are the details: 

- I'm 40 years old, white Latina. 
- I'm 5'4"" and weigh 170lbs.
- I've had two children, both by c-section. 
- I've had one episode of brief psychotic break, which occurred in December of 2016 and lasted five days -- interestingly, during the psychosis, I experienced ZERO pain, until I got home and back in my routine, and back to work. 

Here's what I've been taking in the past three weeks in an effort to somehow kickstart my brain and/or the opes: 

Ashwagandha - 900mg/day
Rhodiola - 1500mg/day
Agmatine - 1000mg/day (every third day off)
DMSO - 1/2 teaspoon per day
DLPA - 2000mg/day
Tryptophan - 1750mg/day
Black seed oil - 2000mg/day
Hordenine - 50mg/day

Diet: 

Dark chocolate
Red wine
Beef
Turkey
Cheese
Yogurt
Walnuts, almonds, cashews, pecans
Garbanzo beans
Broccoli
Hot peppers of every variety

April 15th, 1906
My dearest Cynthia, 

Things here in China have been going splendid. The government is having me inspect crop fields where the grow their precious poppies. “The next wheat crop” they keep telling me. Indeed, the locals seem to be cultivating the plant for themselves. Given all the hubbub, I fancied myself to try some. Oh…my darling, words fail to describe the feeling. 

I felt a pleasant tingling in my stomach as my muscles began to relax. This pleasantness persisted for quite some time…I say twenty or thirty minutes or so. My colleague walked away with a stern and ashamed look on his face when he found me laying here some ten minutes ago. I can understand why many choose to “chase the dragon” as they say. It’s quite the beast to wrangle with. 

I lay here, sleepy and warm. As warm as the fur’s a tiger cub’s mother when she is embraced. As light as a feather that falls from the dove’s wings. No plant I have come across in my studies has yielded such pleasure like this one. Oh my darling…how I wish you were here, for my heart aches for you. The only solace my loneliness has in the absence of your loving arms is the wonderful latex that emerged from the poppy. It’s juice renders me weak, as weak as I am when I smell your perfume and caress your soft, silky red hair. 

My love, I hope we may be reunited soon. The poppy’s latex is wonderful, but this orgasmic feeling shall only be eclipsed in memory when once more I can embrace your loving arms and kiss your lips. Until our reunion, I hope all is well on the home front. I continue to wish your mother well through her illness. She was always a tough old bird. The estate remains pleasant I hope, desperately hoping you stayed stocked on my favorite tea. I hope this letter will reach you in time for your Sunday lunch, when you play cards and billiards with the other street wives. I breathe each day here without you so that one day I may make the house a home once more. 

-Your love, Miles 

P.S. I hope you have space left in your garden. I have a new plant I’m brining home with me.

However, I wanted to spread the word about this drug with a slight warning. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with CRPS and it absolutely sucks. Fortunately, I have found a PM doctor and the first drug they put me on is Nucynta.  I was prescribed a combination of IR 100 mg x 4/day and ER 100 mg x2/day. I took the medication as prescribed and after about a month, I developed SEVERE anxiety/panic attacks. This is unfortunate for me because it really does help with nerve pain. However, upon telling her this, she revealed to me this is a relatively common side effect due to the amount of serotonin in the drug. 

The reason I make this post is because, as it was explained to me, this drug is set to me more readily available as we move forward during the “epidemic”. Somehow, the pharmaceutical companies have sold doctors on there being no withdrawals (total lie - I’ve been switched to oxy and the first few days were absolute hell). With it becoming more prescribed, I imagine more will be diverted and some of you may begin to come across it more often and I wanted to take the opportunity to warn you of the potential side effects should you choose to take it. While I know it’s better than nothing in a pinch, it’s better served as a maintenance drug rather to avoid w/d rather than something to “nod” to. 

Best wishes to you all and I apologize again if this is inappropriate. ",1553640943.0

What makes you feel a buzz off of Buprenorphine is the fluctuation in your blood levels, that's why you don't feel anything if you're on daily maintenance on this drug (blood levels are too stable). With faster metabolism; Shouldn't it allow for more often and bigger fluctuations in your blood levels = being able to feel a slight buzz more often (yes, it would obviously make the effects shorter and you'd run through more of your product). Simply put: In theory it should lower the half-life?

Questionmarks:- I think i read somewhere also that you have to use the SJW regularly, for a couple days or so at least in order for it to actually to ""interfere"" with buprenorphine.- I remember hearing that it blocks buprenorphine and allows for more nor-buprenorphine (which is a full agonist)?

Experiences? Any of this true?

Beware though if you try this. Experimenting with opiates could kill you!

I'm new here, 1 day to be exact lol. I've been lurking around the posts and commenting here and there so o figured I'd introduce myself. My name is ""MiMi"" I'm earlly 30s female. 

Anywho! 

I've been about 6months into I'd like to say ""active addiction"" where I have known I'm addicted to my pain meds. Oxy 10mg (as I call em little pink dots of bliss) 

I've been in pain management for about 10ish years due to chronic pain and illness.. yay me :/ we started small, Tylenol 3 with codeine and muscle relaxers, tramadol...  Slowly moved up to where I'm at today plus gabapentin 400mg two a day and two at night... My oxy dose just got moved up to 3 10mg per day but now I take anywhere between 5-10 a day so I tend to burn through my script pretty fast.  Oh, I'm also on effexor 75mg yay for depression (caused by my most recent surgeries) 
I won't go into details of my pain issues and such as it's a lotttttt. 

Rewind to prior notice of actual addiction... I was very ignorant to withdrawal, dependency and the works. 

I remember my appointment was moved back 2 days and I was now out of my meds, I thought I had the flu, I was insanely sick and I felt like my body was on fire but I was cold, I needed someone or something to squeeze my legs as they felt like they each had IVs of insane amounts of caffeine... Also felt like o had no energy for anything, I didn't even have enough energy to fake a smile. 
I went to the doctors and explained that I thought I had the worst flu of my life and she told me ""you are going through a little bit of withdrawal"" I immediately started crying and said over and over "" how? O thought only addicts went through this"" and that's where she explained everything. I felt like an idiot for NOT KNOWING this information. 
O was only taking the 2 a day like I was told and that was oxy 5mg (it didn't take much to knock me on my behind with any meds like that) 

Now... Well now I can't function on the 3 a day I'm told to take. 
Now... Now I buy from friends when I'm out and sometimes they only have higher doses. And holy crap are these things expensive. Only able to afford it bc I have a really good paying job, if not is be SOL since I have my daughter who I make sure is top priority in my life and has her needs and wants taken care of and has has me present not just physically but mentally and emotionally as well....  And also bills and such which I make sure are paid first as well before I can indulge and not feel guilty but I feel guilty if that makes sense... Like I try and justify spending money on it bc I've taken care of everything else. 


Anyway, I'm scared, angry, embarrassed and disappointed in myself that I let it get this bad. 

I used to not understand how people could become addicted to pills and dope. But now I see it. 
My twin brother was an active addict for yearssssss and I was so annoyed with him bc I though we'll, just quit, use your will power and do it. He tried to explain and o didn't listen. 
He's on methadone and clean from the ""street drugs"" for a few years now, I 100% believe medically assisted programs to help addicts are amazing! 

What I guess I'm trying to say is, I'm sorry... I'm sorry to everyone who is an addict for my lack of knowledge about this and that o should have listened and been more open and understanding bc now I fully how it happens. 

I also apologized to my brother and he has been great while I go through this, and he knows I really enjoy the pills and doesn't give me shit for it. 

Thanks for letting me rant.

I’ve known about him for a while but he only does bulk amounts, 28 OC 20s is the smallest he will sell and the price per mg is kinda shitty considering the long wait, I was just grabbing them locally instead but I saved up enough to buy the good priced 80s and will continue to buy these only since I will have enough saved to re up by the time these are all used up. 



Edit:My history of opiate use I guess. Idk why I wrote this. This always happens when I do methylphenidate I always write a shit ton of paragraphs on Reddit.

Guess this turned into story time aswell, I was high af off methylphenidate and typed all this up.

When I first started using oxy I used it frequently at high doses which is what caused my tolerance to be pretty high for the area I’m living in where the average joe who uses oxy as their opiate of choice just does 1 or even half a 5mg perc, occasionally some people around here do more than one and if you don’t snort them you get weird looks even though percs are much better when taken orally. 

I’m the only one in the area that has access to oxy other than 5mg percs which are the only form of oxy here after the ban on all forms of oxycodone other than 5mg Percocet (yep, highest dose of oxy around here is 5mg Percocet and they go for 9$ USD, 12$ CAD but you can occasionally score some for 10$ CAD a pop). Everyone is too naive to go to the fields and don’t even realize how much they are paying for oxy. People won’t even do oxy 80s when I offer to sell them for much less per mg than percs here because they were banned in my province about a decade ago so people don’t trust them. 

The irresponsible beginning to my oxy habit led to my oxy tolerance building up to around 80mg snorted (call me dumb ik popping is generally better overall and the best ROA in the longterm, atleast I ain’t smokin them tho) with xans since late 2018 when I first started using oxy habitually (yes it’s a death wish but I know my pills test negative for fent which makes it a bit safer and I never do benzo-opiate mixes without a tripsitter watching closely with narcan) to have an ok nod and 100-120mg with xans to have a really nice nod.

First time doing oxy was pretty great. I frequented Reddit, mainly r/stims and was aware of tripsit so I knew higher doses were a thing while idiots here think 2 percs or 3 is a ridiculous amount to do in one sitting. So for my first time i tried 4 5mg percs which tripsit listed as a “strong” high, which I prefer compared to weak highs and that’s for any drug I do (prior to this I’ve only used alcohol for a short period of time, ritalin, weed, and tobacco. It’s pretty dumb how common low dose highs are around here, people were doing lines of a 36mg ER Ritalin and acting like it’s fun, while low doses are appealing to some, everyone does drugs in low doses here it wasn’t just the odd person). So a bit off track but I did 20mg oxy for my first time (I’ve never seen someone do more than 2 percs at once here it’s dumb, and they only snort them). I snorted most of them and popped a little bit since tripsit dosage says that a strong high orally actually requires a bit more oxy compared to snorting. That’s probably because of the quick contact with ur bloodstream which causes a more intense initial high so not as much oxy is needed to have a “strong” high. I didn’t know at the time that the tylonal makes tripsits listed doses for snorted oxy negligible because of the slowed down absorption, making it closer to an oral onset and high since most is swallowed anyways when u snort percs. Pretty quickly I was nodding harder than I ever have to this day, also I took a bit of benedryll 1 hour prior to try and add the antihistamine effects because at the time I enjoyed the high I got from drinking lean which is an antihistamine opiate high so I thought it would be a good idea and I knew that some antihistamines can potentiate opiate highs, DPH being one of them. So I thought I’d probably be able to get some homework done after doing the oxy but the intense nods made it pretty much pointless to even try, and I was getting nothing done. I figured I’d rather just enjoy this crazy high rather than attempt to do homework which was the plan for the day but quickly realized that plan wasn’t gonna work as well as i imagined. So I went and laid down for a bit and relax to some videos on my phone. For the life of me I couldn’t hold my phone up in view while laying down for more than 30 seconds it seemed before me and my hand slowly nodded away until it laid down on my chest and my eyes shut entering a heavenly nod. The funny part was I was scared to fall asleep because I thought I’d OD so every time I realized “oh shit my phones now on my chest” I raised my arm back up and in front of my view to continue watching whatever I was watching to keep myself awake. I’m pretty sure there was a few moments when I just wanted to put the phone away because it got annoying or boring after a while of adjusting my phone back in front of my eyes every minute, and I was enjoying the high and wasn’t really interested in my phone anyways. But I kept the videos on in fear of falling asleep if I didn’t have something to keep me busy.

I’ve only ever gotten close to that nod once and that was from doing a dumb amount of fent pressed percs that were sold as the regular old 5mg percs we see everywhere around here but instead were shitty pressed pills. 

Pressies are very rare in my area and I’ve never seen them before this. It’s probably because there’s only one formula of Percocet people buy around here (There’s two I’ve seen but people will only buy the “TEC” ones and everyone hates the “numbers”). People wouldn’t be able to get away with selling presses around here it just wouldn’t work out since no one can be fooled into buying a crappy looking version of the only Percocet brand I see which has a TEC imprint on one side and a score on the other. People here are so familiar with them as it’s the only print you’ll ever see here, the second a pressed one is attempted to be sold, 95% of users would instantly notice and most likely not buy it because presses are unheard of here and the media has scared people away from them. Pressies aren’t a thing here like they are in the US. 

Back to the story, a friend messaged me asking if I would buy some percs, I said I might depending on the price. I talked for a bit and she seemed pretty desperate to sell them and I ended up getting her down to a price that seemed to good to be true (and it was but I didn’t expect pressed pills cuz I’ve never seen them here in my life) when she could of easily sold them for more elsewhere. 

I took the risk and they looked ok in the dark car where I received and observed them. I’ve never seen or even heard of pressed percs in my area so I assumed that they must have just been a bit beat up or damaged by water when I noticed they looked a bit odd and roughed up. The pills being pressed didn’t really cross my mind but I had a slight suspicion and I could tell something was up. 

The seller was a bit sketchy and told me some long ass story which set off some red flags but I bought them anyways because I didn’t think pressed pills were a thing here. She told some story after we exchanged cash and pills about how her boyfriend had almost 4000 percs seized and was arrested that night but she had these on her at the time and said that she was mad her boyfriend brought cops around and this and that blabbering on about shes selling what she happened to have left over laying around from the large amount that was recently seized because “she was mad at him”, and saying she’s leaving town and needs to get rid of them tonight so that’s why she let them go for a bit cheaper than normal. 

I then knew they had to have been presses since having 4000 pharm percs is a pretty damn unlikely scenario or she was talking out her ass. So then I thought there still might be a chance that these are real percs but just a bit beat up (I now know that chalkyness pretty much confirms a pressed pill instantly and I kinda knew that at the time but was too in the moment to try and ask for my money back although it did cross my mind to try to since I didn’t want to waste the only money I had on garbage since I know presses can be inactive sometimes but I never heard or pressed percs in my whole life of living here so I thought it couldn’t be too much of a risk and they looked alright to re sell to someone if they turned out to be bunk and at the price I ended up getting them for I could even turn a small profit. I even asked at one point “are these fake percs” which she kinda gave me an indirect yes by saying “idk man, my boyfriend had like almost 4000 of them, I did some and they got me high” I tried getting a closer look and said “they don’t look like the fake percs ive seen a few times on the news” they even kinda fooled me because of the dim lighting and also the fact that I hadn’t boughten percs in a little while and couldn’t see the difference at first glance, I stopped buying percs in my city because they were too expensive and only bought them if I happened to have extra money and was desperate enough to not wait the 4 days for my usual OC oxy 80s. 

I lowered the initial price of 1$ per mg before we met up by mentioning that my oxy dealer was charging half of that for oxy without tylonal which was about 50 cents CAD/mg at the time which caused me to decline the initial price of 1$/mg. She seemed desperate to sell them and I kinda wanted to do some oxy that night and knew id have to wait a few days to get the cheap oxy so it was a bit tempting. 

After bargaining and explaining that I get them much cheaper elsewhere (I had to explain to her they were out of town to make the bargain believable since oxy for less than 1$ CAD/mg is pretty much unheard of around here unless it’s bought in bulk, she was clearly desperate and quickly lowered the price to 8$ per pill after only a little bit of smart bargaining (leaving time between replies to make it seem like I wasn’t as interested as I actually was, declining the offer and low balling saying if she doesn’t take the offer within an hour I would be busy blah blah). 

If I didn’t get them for cheap it wasn’t a big issue for me to lose the deal since I’d rather get almost double the amount from my other guy but with a few days wait which didn’t bother me much since I’d have a lot more drugs if I only waited a few more days. 

I played a pretty convincing bargain since I didn’t really mind waiting a few days in exchange for a much better deal as I wasn’t dependent on opiates. 

I was kinda bored at the time and had a little bit of extra cash to throw so I paid a bit over what I usually buy off the fields. We eventually agreed on around 6$ a pill if I recall correctly or it may have been 6.50. 

At the time I thought there was a solid chance that they could indeed be reaI if she was just talking out her ass about the ridiculous quantity she had. It wasn’t until I got inside that i took a closer look and searched online to compare and then knew for sure they were pressies. 

I felt frustrated and ashamed when I discovered I didn’t get what I thought I was buying, and made a post on here saying I got ripped off and was sold fake percs which I thought probably had no oxycodone in it at all since I was familiar with pressed opiates after seeing them all over this sub and concluded they most likely contained fentanyl or some fentalog since that’s what people always relate pressies with on this sub. I searched “fake pressed Percocet Canada” on google images and found an image of pressies identical to mine that led me to an article about fake percocets being seized by police around the eastern part of Canada where I’m also located and having a matching description of the pill, which said thinner letters on the TEC imprint and the pill itself being thinner than real percs. The article also claimed that the fake percs tested positive for fentanyl. 

So now I was stuck with clearly pressed pills that possibly contained fentanyl. I commented on my post I made on this sub about getting fake percs asking what would be the safest way to dose these, because I now had pills which I had no way of properly dosing to get high since there was no way to know the strength of them. 

There was still that chance that they contained nothing and I was still kinda pissed off about being ripped off even tho I made the dumb decision even after multiple red flags, so it was my fault, I ripped myself off pretty much. 

I was kinda curious and thought I’d give them a try since it was a rare occurrence and I read quite a few posts on this sub where quite a few people actually prefer pressies over legit pills so I thought what the hell and waited for someone to answer my question about dosing pressies. 

I quickly received a response from u/spinderella69 who is the head mod here which I knew I could trust with a potentially deadly decision, and IFIRC she said “take half and then wait (pretty sure she said an hour or something) and then take another half to dose my high with these pills of an unknown and potentially deadly strength until I reached desired effects. I’m pretty sure I stated that I would have someone experienced who I trusted to watch me with narcan if I decided to go through with my plan on trying out potential fent presses for my first time which was also my first time trying any opiate stronger than oxy so I was a bit nervous but i thought what the heck I’ll probably never see fent pressies again and decided I was going to do it if I got proper instructions that seemed reasonable from someone on this thread. 

I knew fent presses always have the risk of instant OD even from the smallest amount due to fentanyl and fentalogs insanely high potency and also hot spots being a thing. I think the only reason she suggested I even attempt to do a potentially fatal pill in the first place was because I said I’d do it while someone watches me with Narcan, otherwise I don’t think she would tell someone to try something that can potentially kill you. Even with the narcan it can still be risky as I’ve read stories of people ODing off fent and even multiple doses of Narcan didn’t stop the OD. 

I trusted her advice as she must be experienced with opiates and such to have given me such advice. I thought of a better idea, I would find some dumb ass to do them and test them for me (of course telling them their fent pressies). 

I knew just the guys to try my plan on, these guys would do pretty much anything and I was going to offer them a decent price and claim that they were super good and felt like doing 2 or 3 percs and I told them I’ve done a bunch. 

So they all bought it and took the price I asked for which was 8 bucks a pill, knowing that was a deal they couldn’t turn down as they regularly paid 12 bucks for a regular perc and I claimed these were pretty much the same as doing 2-3 percs so it sounded like an amazing deal. 

I ended up selling a few and didn’t tell them to do half I told them try a full one and see how it is but take it easy and I said I’d be watching with Narcan so there’s no worries. 

The first guy we’ll call him joe, did his slowly and did half of the pile of crushed up pill. He had to run somewhere quickly to grab some weed (which I guess was more important than life itself since I told him he could possibly OD off them but he would be fine if I had Narcan, also it was about a 25 minute walk there and back which is easily enough time to OD). I also made sure they were aware fent doesn’t last as long as regular oxys and has a duration of about 1-4 hours just so I can get a more accurate idea of the strength of these crazy pills I bought, that duration was found on the tripsit website but was only relevant if it was the actual pharmaceutical opioid fentanyl and not some fentalog which can vary heavily in duration between different fentalogs (which I didn’t bring up because I didn’t wanna scare away my potential testers to determine the approx strength of these pills). 

Joe went for the walk and I told him he should stay so I could watch him with the narcan and I made him aware of the potential slim chance of a hot spot before he bought them, which he surely wouldn’t survive the walk if he happened to get one with a hot spot, but he left anyways cause weed is more important than life I guess lol. 

I waited a little bit and then he returned (alive) and I asked him how he liked them and asked him how strong he thought they were, he said they were pretty good and that he liked them and then proceeded to do the other half of the pile he left earlier. The other person at the house bought half of one off me for 5$ and he didn’t seem that high at all and he had a low opiate tolerance. 

At this point I thought it would be safe to try a little line or two, since he didn’t appear to be nodding out of his mind leading me to believe they weren’t too strong since his opiate tolerance is low and mine was decently high at the time (5 5mg percs to feel nice and nod a lil) so I thought I’d be fine if I tested a line or two (spinderella told me to take them orally but I read that the bioavailability for fent taken orally was a lot lower than snorting, which is probably why she recommended since it’s the safer route for testing myself, but I already got these idiots to test them for me through the ROA I wanted to try.) because always see people snort fent pressies on this sub so that was the way I wanted to experience them since it’s the ROA I see most frequently other than smoking which I didn’t trust and it was a big pill to smoke anyways. 

I did the few lines and felt pretty good, my pupils constricted to pinpoints which I observed in my tester as well allowing me to conclude some sort of active ingredient atleast and not some sort of placebo effect which my tester was perceiving, I also experienced some euphoria and was pretty talkative like a very low dose of oxy so I did a few more lines and went for short walk down the block to my good friend who I always go to when I need someone to watch me with Narcan. 

I frequently did oxy mixed with benzos and he’s watched me many times and he’s good at keeping a close eye on me, I toss him a bit of cash whenever I get him to do this because I feel bad asking someone to take responsibility for my life in the first place so offering a bit of cash made it better for both of us as it can require a bit of focusing and it can be a bit of a hard task to keep a close eye on someone for multiple hours and he was the best person I knew for this and the person I trusted most. He’d constantly ask me “u good” throughout the duration of my high and that’s exactly he should be doing. This friend is also aware of the signs of an opiate overdose and keeps an eye out for any potential signs/symptoms. This is where I really gave these pills a go.

I did them one at a time for a little while and then two at a time and went through about 6 of them not including the half I did before coming to his house. 

After doing a few I was feeling really nice and each one was stronger than one perc so I got my money’s worth I guess after I thought I got ripped off and was scared to try them and didn’t even know what I was going to do with them, I thought I’d have to rip someone off and sell them to get my money back, and I say rip someone off because that’s what it’s called here if you try and sell fake pills. It’s nothing like I see in the US where people prefer and willingly buy pressies. If I tried to sell them as pressed pills no one would be interested as they are unheard of here and people are scared of them. However I luckily sold some for a profit to those guys who tested them, probably because I claimed they were amazing and gave them a “bro deal” saying they are new in town and going for 10$ easily when I paid 6$ each, making a quick buck and getting some of my money back to probably spend on my actual DOC oxy as I didn’t feel too good about doing fentanyl, I feel like that’s taking things a bit too far when it comes to drugs for me as oxy is the “worst” drug I’ve done, and don’t ever plan on doing any harder drugs like coke  or H which I’ve seen ruin many close peoples lives. 

I’m currently in school to become a doctor and wouldn’t ever wanna go down that path of addiction. I feel ok with oxy and i admit I’m addicted but I’m getting much better at controlling it and I like to consider myself a functional addict, which is much harder to achieve whilst being addicted to much harder drugs.

This part of Canada sucks for opiates mainly oxy, so restricted here and the price is stupid high. We do have some crazy hydromorphine here tho that are 30mgs (Be jealous Americans it’s true, as ridiculous as it sounds) which come in the form of capsules that contain beads and are hydromorph contin so like a OxyContin. It’s the only injectable form of prescription opiate other than fent patches you can get around here I think. People who want to IV opiates have to resort to either H or hydros since there’s no injectable forms of oxy available although I heard they brought back IR oxycodone up to 20mg max dose but I haven’t seen any around so I’m not sure. Stronger opiates such as oxy/hydro/fent are prescribed here strictly for cancer pain and rarely for other issues, u might get 5mg percs if you are lucky but usually they just give u tylonal with codeine and send u on ur way.(Another cool Canadian fact, it’s not as cool as the 30mg hydros but we can get tylonal 1s over the counter here which means codeine for everyone! As long as you know how to CWE)

So, IV bupe is a more suitable drug for people who still need to enjoy their opioids compulsively vs sublingual bupe.

My thoughts are that it equals out in the end (cheap+lower quality ≈ expensive+high quality) but in reality that's probably not the case, and one is superior. 

What are your thoughts on this? I'm so fed up with the varying quality of tar around here. It takes such a large amount for me to actually feel high instead of just baseline normal.

I was on methadone for two years after using heroin for four years. Now that most of the physical symptoms are gone I find myself extremely depressed. 

All the things I did while I was using are coming to surface and I am facing all of it. The fact I choose to lose every one of my friends over drugs. All the damage I did to my family. All the people I screwed over to get high. All the opportunities i ruined for drugs. 

I had gone on antidepressants before using opiates when I was maybe fourteen but didn’t like the way they made me feel like a zombie. However now with my current mental state I am more and more thinking going on something might be a good idea. Has anyone had a good experience with any medications or supplements to help with depression after getting clean. Any help is greatly appreciated. ",1553619187.0

I needed 9 doses of narcan to bring me back. But even more shockingly, and disgustingly I overdosed while my children were in the next room. They are 11 and 6.  And for those of you who didn't read my post, and  will assume that I did not fully grasp the weight of that awful decision please know that I absolutely hate myself more than anyone could fathom, and I will carry this guilt as long as I live and if my children never forgive me, I wouldn't blame them one bit. 
 But anyway I have been going through the most painful self inflicted situation I could possibly imagine, and as many junkies do, I have completely boxed myself into complete isolation.  I was in an abusive relationship for the last 4 years, during which I relapsed with dope after over 10 years clean. When I OD'd I didn't even have anyone to call from the hospital.  And after I checked myself out and the guy I had been living with, relapsed with, and had been my only constant besides my children the last 4 years left for treatment Saturday, this sub and a few people I have met from it have been my ONLY support system whatsoever throughout this entire ordeal. 
In a situation where literally everyone would have the right to tell me that I deserve every bit of misfortune that comes my way, in a world where most people would tell me how glad they are that protective services took my children from me and that they hope I never get them back, this is the world and the internet that we have today. 
 But this sub hasn't done any of that. I recieved almost 50 comments of encouragement, of well wishes, of positivity, and of love from complete strangers. I'm just blown away by the compassion on this sub. In a world where so many of us are jaded, so stuck in our own heads, a lot of us in viscous cycles, and even the many chippers, and the people who casually flirt with addiction. Everybody shows love and support when one of us needs it. And I just needed to say thank you for that. Without you guys I would have had NOT A SOUL to talk to or share this with over the last few days. And who knows maybe that guilt and shame and bottled up shit may have led me to take another fatal dose because this time nobody would have found me. I would have been lucky to have been found as I started to smell, that's how alone I am right now... 
So thank you opiates, you have no idea how truly grateful I am for this community. 
And when I leave for treatment today, I hope everyone stays safe and hugs their children a little tighter today. Well today and every day because you really have no idea when that may be taken from you. ",1553612673.0

&#x200B;

here's some context:

I currently live with my older brother, it's just the two of us in our flat. He's been on a methadone programme for 9 years and I am almost certain he has relapsed again. I would say it happened/has been happening about a month-6 weeks ago.

I don't have evidence that he's relapsed but all the tell tale signs are there. e.g. Incredibly reclusive and avoidant, going out at strange times, incredibly anxious about not being able to use the car (that we share) when he wants to, he earns more than 3 x my salary but has had to rely on me to spot him money. We went abroad for 4 days this last weekend and he was noticeably struggling and reclusive. My other brother and his girlfriend, who were with us on this trip, said they were concerned he'd relapsed too. He was only happy and chipper on the way home and as soon as we got in he made a phone-call and left the house and came back very late.

I've been through this with him before when we were teenagers and it was an absolute shit show to be honest - my parents were so inept at helping him in almost every way. Therefore I took on way too much and had no support myself. It was a really awful time.. He's done so incredibly well to overcome his addiction and to start fulfilling his potential again. Over the years I've been trying to build and maintain a relationship with him that reassures him of how proud I am of him for overcoming his past and keeps the door open in case he needs someone to talk to.

Now we're adults (both 30+). He's a grown man and he knows better than to put his finances, career and health at this type of risk. I'm resentful/hesistant to do anything at all because the memory of how awful and stressful my teenage years were still haunt me, but I don't seem to have a choice. He's my brother, he has barely any friends and I live with him.

I spoke to his support worker last week to share my concerns about his recent behaviour and I asked what their protocol is if he was to fail a drugs test. It's up to him to disclose to me if he's failed or passed, and the clinic wouldn't call me to notify me either. I know he was tested yesterday as I had asked them to give him a surprise test the next time they see him but when I asked how his appointment with this support worker went he didn't mention the test to me but he did seem a bit down...

&#x200B;

So -

\- Does any one have any advice or tactics for me of how I could I try to help to curb how far this relapse could go?

\- Is that even possible for anyone to do other than him??

I personally would like him to be on subutex rather than methodone for example, but I don't know who to ask about whether this could be an option for him.

\- Is it a bad move if I call the clinic to ask for the results of his test? He wouldn't expect me to do this..but I doubt he'll tell me himself. i want to know whether my suspicions are correct so I know what I'm dealing with, but I don't want to go behind his back..

\- Can anyone relate to my brother's situation?

\- Do you have some insight for me of how you would've liked your family to approach you if you were relapsing?

\- If you wanted help, what help would you want?

\- What sort of questions can I ask, or how can I phrase ""Are you back on heroin"" without ruining my living situation with him if he genuinely wasn't using again and he felt wrongly accused?

&#x200B;

Honestly, any insight would be helpful for me right now. I feel very alone with this.

Recently, out of curiosity and pure stupidity, I have attempted to RoboTrip, as I find weed (because I smoke that frequently) to be boring most of the time. 
Where as, I know, I could just space out the days that I smoke weed, but it's one of the only stress relievers there really is where I live. The most effective at least. 
But, again, out of curiosity and stupidity, I attempted it a few times. Even in front of my family, mind you. 
I truly felt that it was fun at the time, even if I only reached the 2nd plateau, and I even felt more passionate towards others, especially in the way that they spoke to me.

This is long, I'm aware, but I'm in need of comfort. 
I'm mildly enthusiastic about drugs and their effects, particularly those with psychedelic properties. That is also why I decided to try this. 
I do not want to be shamed in my family for doing this sort of stuff. Even if they know I have done many other drugs in the past, cough syrup doesn't exactly appeal to most, if that even makes sense... I'm just, paranoid.

so in the last 2 weeks I did some oxycodone, before that I had about a month or two long Subutex (bupre) habit. At the moment I take 80-100mg per day. I decided I definetly need to stop and I'm determined to do so. However I'm not 100% sure how long that will take and what I can do to ease wd. I will definetly wait at least till this weekend bc I could never wd at work. I got enough Oxys to last till Friday. The next week I got Wednesday till Sunday off. So 5 days in a row. I'm wondering if this is enough to get through the worst and if I should maybe buy enough Oxys to last exactly until my vacation?
I also think about what I can get to make wd easier. At the moment I got 20 x 1mg Xanax, 4 x 2mg Kpins and 13 x 75mg pregabalin. I wonder how much pregabalin you gotta take? Pregabalin is quite expensive where I live but it has helped before. But back then I only had very mild wds.

Thank you in advance!

Edit: I just realized I'd have to pay quite some money just to keep the wd away till my vacation. Maybe I should use the rest and then call in sick to work...

I didn't reword any of this post, it's just a response to a guy, he posted in this sub asking ""Is twice a week too much?"" Said thread is now deleted.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

You asking indicates a problem off the bat. You say you limit to 2 days a week. You say youre now using Thursday. This is addiction 101; you set restraints, stick with em for a while, then start bending them just a tad and justify it because it was just one time or whatever the case is (Thursday).

Then you start getting sick, and get comfortable in body and mind using an average dose every day. Its okay though, you're only using enough to stay well and have everything under control. Then you're not getting high though so you start using more. Gradually your tolerance is getting out of hand and you hadn't realized. Then you think about using the needle. You might toss and turn with the idea, it could be a couple days a couple months or even a couple years, but very few people don't move on to IV. After your $100 a day habit is too much to handle, you decide to try it just *one* time. Refer to first paragraph to find out what happens.

Now you're great, for a while. Tolerance is slowly but definitely rising from shooting and money's beginning to become an issue *again*, so you start sellin shit. Just little things at first. You know, the things you justify in your head that you're never going to use, that old cell phone, those vintage baseball cards your pops gave you when you were young. You know, just, superfluous shit. As tolerance rises so does the money you must acquire.

So you start selling bigger shit; more valuable shit. Old cars, electronics, the car you're driving, the car your significant other is driving, (*was*) after you lied to them and said when you were borrowing his / her car because your car was stolen, the same thing happened and you know that they know it's a bunch of shit but you don't give a damn.*yourself*. Trust, respect, self worth, family relationships, work, crumble, right before your half open pinned eyes; it's ok though, after walking a mile and a half and catching an hour bus trip to cop, you're currently in the midst of preppin a shot.

Alone. In your car. Cold. Lonely. Broke. Broken. Freezing. Cold outside, freezing regarding something else. Your spirit and soul shook to the core with an unfathomable sensation of darkness and despair knowing that at this point in time your will to live has ceased to exist other than the liquid that was in your syringe, now coursing through your bloodstream.

Its empty now. Like yourself.",1553600492.0

Maybe you don't steal but it's harder not to lie. Is it stealing if you lie about why you need money and get it? 

What about manipulating people? I definitely don't think you can keep it secret long if you don't manipulate people, at least a little. 

I have a vegan friend who won't buy eggs on the principle that it might contribute to torturing a chicken. Yet I'll buy from someone who's cutting with fent if I'm in wd and can't get anything better.

I used to steal candy when I was a kid and I stopped cause I felt so bad about it. I told myself I'd never steal again but then I was homeless and hungry and in withdrawal. I used to care about bands selling out cause there's more to life than money but now I wish I was a girl so I could fuck for cash. I used to try to be ethical. I even rationalized using as a big fuck you to a society I didn't want to be a part of but lately I think being an addict is unpunk af cause you can't stand for anything when you're in withdrawal.

I felt the need to share this story with someone. I'm a male sexual assault survivor and it's rough. I've never told anyone this because I fear they won't believe me, or call me a pussy ect.

So, I used to use very occasionally. When this story started, I hadn't used in like 4 months.

I was sitting downtown in my city, in the late afternoon eating outside of a local pizza place.

2 girls who were friends with my friends came up to me. They seemed nice enough. After we got to talking, they asked me if I knew where to get dark. I said ""Sure. I got you.""

Now they'd seemed like decent people up until this point, and I knew them from high school and through some friends so I thought ""What the hell"", we all ended up going back to my apartment so I could help them pick up and give them a safe place to use.

We wait around for a while for my dealer, she gets to my house, and I hand her the $150 we'd pooled together. They get their dark, and ask me to use with them. I got a weird feeling, and said ""Before I do this, I want you to know that I'm really not interested in sex right now, please don't try to do anything with me.""

I know that seems like a weird thing to say, but it really felt like I needed to. I should've taken this as a sign to tell them to fuck off, but I'm generally socially anxious and couldn't bring myself to do it.

We started using. I used a fair amount, we were pretty high. I cut myself off. They kept going, and eventually managed to pressure me into doing more. And more. And more, until I was basically incapacitated.

My memory is hazy from this point forward, so detail will be sparse, but this is what I remember. I threw up a few times and went and closed myself in my room to be alone. I'd snorted it, so I was even more incapacitated than I was. I couldn't walk.

One of those two girls comes in my room, and gets on top of me. I tell her to stop, and make an effort to resist, but I'm too weak.

She tells me that they'd been ""planning this since they saw me downtown"", and proceeds to have violent sex with me. She hits me, and scratches me, and generally physically hurts me the whole time.

She eventually stops, and leaves the room. I'm a mess, but I'm thankful that it's over.

She then sends her friend in, and her friend does the same fucking thing, for even longer.

This rotates, like 4 times. By then it's the morning, and I text my girlfriend and tell her I need to go over to her house, desperately.

I leave, telling the 2 girls I'm going to work, and I stay with my girlfriend for like 2 days, come back to my house, and they're gone.

Now I use every day. If I'm sober for a minute, this memory kills me. This was a year ago today, if I remember the day correctly. I'm a mess.",1553567314.0

Well I have noticed lately specially today, that it isnt the case anymore. If any of you know anything about painting, you know how frustrating and irritating it is when you go to spray your primer before you flake, and all your primer wants to do is bubble up and wrinkle up. You got to scrape it all off and re-whip it down with lacquer and clean it again then lacquer again and try to primer it again. 

Well after the first time, i walk to the bathroom and hit a line and smoke a cig. Then tried again. It wrinkles up. So I'm pretty hot at this point because so far nothing in this unit is going right nor the unit before. So I take another break and hit the rest of that pack n try again. Fucks again. So im really pissed now. Then I look down and noticed I have stepped on one of thr wet primer pieces I scrape off and there are marks every where on the floor. I unplug my gun and throw my shit down. Clean up the marks i tracked everywhere so it didnt stain shit and packed my shit and left for the day. I had 3 units i was suppose to do. Only finished 1 lol. 

So with all that being said. Do you remember when dope used to help you out? Because im thinking now it only makes things worst. When im already pissed and stressed that is. It sucks i can't even enjoy it really anymore. Only thing I enjoy about it now is that im not curled up in the bed sick af feeling like I'm dieing.

Have not used in four days besides a tiny bit of Suboxone and although I am so ready to go I am still struggling with wanting to use once more. It's not really an option at the moment without begging or doing something that could land me in jail. With a court case hanging over my head I am not willing to go that route.

So, as I do with any pills I get, I do a taste test. These tasted like very little to nothing, and they were a bit chalky. Is that possible that some pills just have no taste?
The nibbles I had knocked me out last night though, which slightly concerned me.

I am nodding like a bitch and it's funny because nobody can say shit about it, since they all know about my disability and why I am taking all those drugs for. 

Obviously they don't know I am doing H but whatever.

**Follow-up:**

Okay I need to add few clarifications here as I have already been accused of being a liar and allegedly taking advantage of my workplace.

The people in the company I work for have seen it all from the very beginning, and they know what I have been going through for the past 6 years.

This disability has ruined my life. Can you imagine a life where you cannot seat, cannot stand for too long, have to count the time you can stay in bed and anytime you go to the bathroom is a gang rape? Knowing that only few thousands people worldwide are affected and is kinda unknown? Well this is my life currently.

I moved area twice during the past 2 years, and the GPs I have seen have always been reluctant in prescribing any seriously potent opioids such as Oxycodone or Fentanyl, that due to the opioid crisis propaganda on the TV.

This very last GP I got is a total noob and nightmare, to the point that on our very first appointment she suggested I should come off Tramadol lol, and that I should give the regular pain medications another try. 
She obviously had no idea of what **Pudendal Neuralgia** was, and I recommended her to do some study on it. She later called me back apologizing...

You may say, why don't you find another GP than? Unfortunately that is not possible as she is the only GP within 20 miles. I live in a very small village. I tried getting a GP in the city but apparently it is too far away from my home's post code and they wont sign me up.

As far as work is concerned, I am not really taking advantage of anything nor anyone using my disability as excuse. I am among the most trusted Unix System Administrator in this office, and I have been here almost 6 years. They know very well what my face looks like before and after going to the bathroom.

They allow me to work from home 2 days per week, and take more home office days whenever I need, no questions asked. However, I try to come to the office at least 3 times per week as otherwise it would be unfair for the other guys there. I have the fortune of working for a very good company in a very relaxed environment. They know the medications I take are heavy, and that I double, and sometimes triple up the amount during crisis. 

Regarding me doing heroin.. Do you seriously think I like locking myself into a train station bathroom to smoke it? Or having to hide it from the wife and anyone else? Knowing that it might screw up my life even more than it is already? No, I really don't like it. But currently I have no other alternatives, not until a proper Pain Management Specialist sees me, and in the UK this might be several months.

After 6 years of drawing in silence from the pain, night and days non stop, no movie out, no pizza out,, not a walk, nothing, I literally had enough. 

Lastly I wanted to say, this was intended to be a sarcastic post, but perhaps I failed to transmit the right vibes. I don't quite care if you donwvote me, be my guest. But calling me a liar, especially when you know nothing about me? Nah. That I won't take it. 

I am not seeking compassion nor anything, and expect nothing in return.",1553513258.0

But im really hoping hoping some of u have had this happen before. Which I'm sure it has. 

Ok so short background on me. I started using oxy off and on for about 3 yrs and that last yr or so I switched from about 40-50mg of oxy to H which by the time I got clean I was smoking about a gram or so a day of bth. Well that ended in 2017 i decided I'm done and i got clean after being sober for awhile I started to use again but it would be like a dub or so once every other month maybe? Then about a month ago when I was injured and was given tylenol #3 for pain and eventually given norco for a bit only to have to switch back to the #3s.  So after about 2 weeks or so of using the pills I started buying dub sacks here and there maybe twice a week or so. Mostly because I hated the #3 pills as they would help me for about 2hrs or so before I'd wake up in alot of pain so I got frustrated of not sleeping so I would get bth to take the pain away. 

So ever since I had been clean for awhile and would use a little bit once in awhile I started to get very itchy when I would use and I had never really got that way when I used a lot more and more often. Also another thing started happening I would get nausea out of no where and more often then not I'd puke usually once then I was fine. That never happened when I was really using at all. I could never even now obviously figure out why. 

Just for reference I had the same plug from when I was really using the entire time until recently since I moved out of state.  But still different state different plug same thing keeps happening.

Solution: On many computers there's a setting where you can press your control key and it will draw a circle around your mouse about an inch and a half in diameter, and the circle will quickly go from big to small, enclosing your mouse. 

&#x200B;

How to turn it on: 

1. Search on your computer for ""Mouse Settings"" and pull it up.
2.  Next, at the bottom (usually at the bottom but may be in other places on the window you pulled up) click on ""Additional Mouse Settings"" (For others this could be called something like advanced settings, etc.)
3. Next click on the tab called ""Pointer Options""
4. Click the box called ""Show the location of pointer when I press the CTRL key""
5. Click the ""Apply"" key in the bottom right, followed by the ""Ok"" key

I just wrote it cause i feel weird and Idk wanted to share for some peculiar reason. Enjoy, maybe idk.

&#x200B;

Guess we start when I was young,

my dad leaves, i still have fun.

My mum did great, she raised me well,

she thought this too, no one can tell.

the years pass, the pain it fades

getting stronger for later days.

Mum finds another a decent man

I call him ""dad"" I am a fan.

&#x200B;

in grade 6 now hes gone too

I scare them off, am I the flu?

Again they leave mum is alone

I spend my days on the phone

Talking, chatting, to my friend so dear

Always happy, to lend an ear.

Mum finds another, from a different state

I follow here, a delayed blate

&#x200B;

New town, new school, new friends I see

Maybe this isnt too bad for me

15 now, and I start to seek

an altered state, escape the bleak

I tell myself its just for fun

I take the tabs, i swallow its done

the next few hours are amazing and bliss

why would people keep me from this

&#x200B;

I realise then that media lies

drugs are fun they don't ruin lives

I order more, I feel so great

I tell some people, share with a mate

Now this is where i slip and fall

down that white rabbits fucking hole

""Hey man come round, got XTC""

I find a lift ""Just you and me?""

&#x200B;

We lick the bag and laugh like mad

Rolling, falling, how could this be bad

the come down hits its pretty rough

I soldier through i can be tough

I look online and there I see

A magnificent drug, surely for me!

You get so high, warm and content

they had me there my money is spent

&#x200B;

I try the opiate, warm bliss and glee

No damn comedown, i feel so free

codiene codiene i wish i knew

the propoganda for you was true

this is great how bout oxy

""Even better, you shall see""

grab a pill, down it goes

put a little up my nose

&#x200B;

HOLY SHIT FUCK THIS IS GREAT

I Want to live, in this state

Now come on man, just once a week

felt so easy, future was bleak

I lose my foot, and down i fall

down further the rabbits hole

&#x200B;

I don't know why I still do choose

I take the oxy for fun not blues

The lie manifests deep within

Was it my father, begins with him?

Am I just weak, faint of heart

Atleast no heroin I shall start

&#x200B;

My heart goes out to you alone

Suffering struggling trapped by a stone

deeper than me within the hole

that damn white rabbit, it took my soul.

Really a good question, imo. If you think opiate addiction is a disease, I guess you are off the hook, more or less.

I don’t know what it is. A learning disorder, moral weakness, character flaw, genetic disposition, dkdc. Doesn’t matter to me.

18 year old me put a needle in his arm. 18 year old me thought that older people were power hungry control freaks and prudes, or just ignorant while leading their fake hypocritical lives with their fake friends. 

So their opinions did not really count.

Part of me had always felt like the entire high school experience was stupid. Learning stuff I would never need with people whose games I did not understand, taught by teachers who didn’t respect the kids and did not trust them. 

Something in my brain was profoundly uncomfortable with this scenario. It was a problem I could not solve. I wanted it to go away and drugs did that for me. 

Perfect solution, right?

What teenage me didn’t figure out was that drugs did nothing to actually solve the problem. All it did was sedate me so I didn’t worry about it.

Adult me looks back at it and thinks, realcat you ignorant slut. Why didn’t you get off your ass and figure it out? It really was not all that complicated. 

I guess I can handle things as an adult that baffled me when I was really young. Of course, at this point it did not matter, because I got strung out, then needed money to get my drugs, which led me down a bad path of criminal activity, which got me hooked up with really bad people, which affected my own ethical values, which basically allowed me to fuck everything up beyond all recognition.

If I had looked at it logically, and had the ability to deal with the pieces of the puzzle, maybe things would be different. But there were no classes for emotional control back then and I was in no mood to think that maybe it was me.

End result, I was pretty much asleep for eleven years. Other people told me I had fun, though. Don’t know, can’t remember.",1553468852.0

(ResearchGate),"This study suggests: BEVEL DOWN ([ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280075771_Investigation_of_Needle_Bevel_Face_Up_and_Down_Orientation_on_Pediatric_Intravenous_Access)).

Should you inject bevel up or bevel down? [This graph](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-measured-force-of-the-bevel-up-and-down-insertion-procedures_fig3_280075771) indicates that you need to use more force if you inject bevel up, something that I've always done because I've seen medical staff do when they draw up blood.

However, if you inject bevel down you do not need as much force to achieve a greater insertion distance, therefore, the action of the needle is less likely to damage or roll your veins away.

[This graph](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Deformation-of-the-mimicked-blood-vessel-before-the-needle-entering-into-the-lumen-of-the_fig5_280075771) describes the deformation of a blood vessel measured against the number of times it has been accessed via a needle (Deformation v. Number of Pricks).

You can see clearly that the blood vessel deforms much faster (width shrinkage) - becoming less accessible over time if you inject BEVEL UP.

[This](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-whole-deformation-process-of-the-IV-access-with-a-bevel-down-and-b-bevel-up_fig4_280075771) is what happens to your vein if you inject BEVEL UP... if I am to believe this study I am never going to inject this way again. Is there any reason why the current harm reduction philosophy dictates that we inject bevel up?

Anyone want to contest this philosophy going around IV circles?",1553462874.0

Also is the cartel pressing these? I was told the lighter m30 presses are just fentanyl where as the real dark blue m30 presses are carfentanil which is much much stronger.

Nothing special.,"Well after 4 long years of using behind literally everybody's back it all finally caught up to me. Last Friday (March 15) I was with my dude and we were on our way to go cop a little something before we picked up our paychecks for the weekend. Oddly enough something told me to hug my kids a little tighter before taking them to school, I made sure to grab their little faces and look them dead in the eyes as I told them with every ounce of my being that I loved them more than all the stars in the sky and all the fishies in the sea. The same as I have always told them since they were little bundles of meat carefully wrapped up in their favorite blankies back when I had years of clean time under my belt. But even though I never thought for a second I wouldn't be tucking them in that night for the first time in 10 years. Our tire went flat so I made the decision to turn right heading towards a township known for being dicks. But fuck it. I wasn't doing anything wrong. I just wanted air and cigarettes. And then we'd be on our way. I didn't get a quarter mile before he threw the cherries on. My nose was running, and nausea was setting in but still I was confident that we'd be on our way in no time. I gave him my license, registration, and insurance he walked back to his car. 15 minutes passed and just as we were noticing no other cars were turning up and we were thinking we were golden... 3 fucking cars pulled in behind us. This cannot be good. It was 9am. And I was still okay because even if this turned into some bullshit I should still have been home in time for my kids to get home from school. Then all I would have to do is have someone go for me. I would be feeling like hell but I'd be home with my kids and that's all that matters. 
He pulls me from the vehicle and begins to ask me if I'm aware of my dudes violent history. 9 years for voluntary manslaughter and 4 years for aggravated assault. Of course I'm aware but also the last time he committed a violent crime was over 8 years ago so...  at least as long as we had been together that was no longer a thing. Then he asked if I knew he had been arrested on dope related charges over the last year. We all have our demons I say, but still it doesn't make someone unlovable. The cop asks me again and again where we came from, what we were doing, and where we were going from there. He goes back to my dude and I can see him asking him the same repetitive questions over and over. I'm not worried because I'm old enough to know whether I'm doing anything illegal or not, whenever you get pulled over the first thing you discuss is exactly the who what when where and why you're out and about together. That way no one trips up and no one causes any alarm. Neither of us are strangers to the law so I won't even consider the possibility that our stories will be inconsistent. The cop comes back to me a 4th time and once again we go over the fact that I was getting air and cigarettes at wawa and then heading to the city to pick up our checks. Only this time he says our stories aren't matching up and he thinks we have dope in the car. I couldn't help but roll my eyes because I know there's no dope in the car. And I also know neither of us are confusing our stories because well, we weren't telling any. There's now 5 officers on the scene and I'm beginning to think there's more going on than just a search. A female comes up to pat me down and as she finishes she tells me to turn around and put my hands behind my back. I ask why I'm being detained and she says a bench warrant came up for a traffic ticket that's not even a month old. Fuck. Life has been crazy and that completely slipped my mind. Now that I can take on the chin. I'm still thinking to myself okay, no big deal, they'll take me to the station, I'll get RORd and get a new court date. I'm not a career criminal, I've never skipped court before there's no way this can turn into a stay in county. 
How many times can I be dead ass wrong before 10am?!!?!
Well now the cop that's been with my dude comes over and says he has a warrant from the next town over and my heart sinks because now I KNOW I will have no chance of being bailed out should it come to that. And just in time for the cop to tell me that he spoke to the township my warrant is out of and they wont even consider me going anywhere but straight to county to sit until the 27th. For a fucking traffic ticket... And to drive that last little nail through my heart... I need to get in touch with someone who can get my kids from school since I wont be going home to them anytime soon. 
I wont go into the next few days I spent in jail because I am fully aware that there are millions of Americans who are truly tortured and abused within the system every day of their lives, and they have no way out. So my pity party of kicking a 30 bag a day fentanyl habit is truly nothing compared to their plight. And purely based on the fact that miraculously I was bailed out by a man who hates my guts I refuse to complain about the condition I left in because many many many women just like me never get the opportunity to leave as I did that day. I had no voice whatsoever being that I had done nothing but vomited straight blood and bile the entire time I was inside. The ride home although awkward, I was humbled and apologetic. I stumbled through my front door, flipped the heat on full blast and fell into my bed fully clothed, 1/2 dead and not even slightly motivated to find a way to spend this 40 bucks I still had that I was going to cop those days prior. I was just too weak. And all i wanted was my kids. I managed to find a few cottons that would give me just enough to make my kids some lunch, get them set up for the day, cuddle them for a bit and listen to them tell on each other for all the things they tried to get away with while they were staying at their favorite aunt and uncles. 
And so I did. It was the best feeling I've felt in a very long time. How fucking pathetic. I spent the next 2 days laying in bed vomiting blood and bile still only getting up to help my kids eat, drink, or bathe. A couple times I asked my neighbor to borrow their phone to send an SOS text to a fellow junkie friend begging their mercy to bring me a get well only to hear nothing back and never feel that sweet relief of hearing a familiar sound of someone pulling in my driveway. 
But of course the sickness just got worse and worse and I had to at least try to make the next move.. I somehow got extremely lucky and managed to catch a guy I middle for who was lovely enough to bring me a few bags to get well. I could not have been happier... this was it guys! This is all I needed to get back on track. So my savior comes to my door in a little over an hour and I do 2/3 bags knowing I'm probably going to need that 3rd before I'm able to cop my usual stamp which is a lovely 8/10 which is pretty fucking good for north east fentynal. As I'm coming out of my bathroom my buddy says he just received a text from my dude who just got released from custody at a hospital about an hour away asking if he could please get in touch with me so I could come pick him up. Talk about wild man... that was extremely lucky. But he doesn't realize that the van was taken and I have been told by family it is no longer left in the parking lot where we were pulled over and I have no means to get it out of a tow yard where I imagine it has been for at least two  days at this point. And with another stroke of luck my buddy offers to go pick him up. I get to crawl.in bed for another couple hours but at least I know at this point I will be getting well at some point today. 
I dont really remember the specifics of this day other than my dude coming home and handing me a few bags which is 150% exactly how it goes down every single time I'm in this kind of condition. Only this is the first time in my entire 4 year run that I have gone this many days without using. (This was day 4 or 5 I'm not really sure) 
I mix my shot and stammer into my bathroom. The rig I'm using is so fucking dull i had to switch it out after attempting twice in my neck to no avail. On the fourth try i finally register, I take a deep breath as I await that blanketing feeling of relief. I walk out of my bathroom about 20 feet to my bed, I dont even remember if I made it the entire way. 
Suddenly I'm hearing my name coming from every direction. Its getting louder and louder like I'm under water. I'm absolutely freezing cold. I'm soaking wet. I'm laid out on my hardwood floor and everything is just so loud but so muffled and there's 15 people in my little room. They keep telling me I need to get up, they keep saying we gotta get you to the ER, and I hear them saying they've never used that much narcan before.  All I can think is THIS CANNOT BE REAL. THEY CANNOT BE TALKING ABOUT ME. I keep trying to speak but nothing is coming out. An emt kneels in front of me and tells me he knows how much I love my kids, which means he knows I dont want to leave them with the image of their mother being wheeled out on a gurnee. That's enough to get me the fuck up. I took 2 steps and everything went black. Once again I wake up only this time I swear I'm on a Space ship. The loud ass sirens, all the lights, and it's like still flashes. I hear 2 guys say they've never seen this type of reaction before. I spent the next 24 hours in ICU in and out of seizures due to the tranq in the fentanyl. It's a really fucked up feeling knowing you're covered in your own vomit but unless someone comes around with a suction tube its gonna stay there. But none of that compares to the feeling of child services coming to ICU to tell me that my kids are no longer in my care. I spent the next 4 days in the hospital until I checked myself out the day before yesterday. 
Now I'm not looking for sympathy or compassion whatsoever. I violated the most precious thing this world has to offer and that is the bond between mother and child.  I deserve to feel every bit of this pain and if my kids never forgive me then that is their right and I deserve to feel every bit of it until the day I die. But I tell my story because I was the functional addict that no one had any idea I had needles in my arms every single day and night. My children were never subjected to the junkie life, they never wanted for anything and are both in talented and gifted programs. I NEVER thought this could happen to me. I thought I could successfully hide it and keep it under control because well I had been a 15 year veteran of the dope game. 
I was clean for years before I got pregnant with both my kids. Their infancy's were the happiest times of my life. It got so much harder as they got older because they didn't need me as much anymore, and I'm so fucking damaged that instead of realizing that I was raising healthy independent human beings I took it personal somehow that they didn't need me every second of every day. At least now I get to go back to making every second of every day all about them. Everything I do will be to get them back. I am praying to get into treatment today. No ones making me go, I just know I dont need a DYFS judge to tell me I need treatment to get my kids back. I'll do everything of my own accord. 
So please to all of you with children at home... please consider treatment before shit hits the fan. Please hug them tightly and spend some extra time with them. You really dont know if the opportunity will be taken from you. 
My apologies for the length of this post. 
I pray everyone stays safe today. ",1553440183.0

So I have noticed that when I am on kratom and sort of nodding, I will get auditory hallucinations. It sounds like a faint voice, rarely manifesting as any full words but I can hear them and they sound like voices. Is this normal in people who are healthy? I am worried about this being a sign that I am schizophrenic. Does anyone else get these auditory hallucinations? Also if I nod out far enough I get dreamy visions and scenes in my head.

I was strung out on dope and they put me on methadone then proceeded to slowly taper me off it. Right when I got clean I discovered kratom  used and then abused that till Christmas. Then I started with the dope again. Now I’ve got a fully blown 2 bundle a day habit and I’m still in a program as an ‘upper peer’. I’ve been there two years so they trust me and rarely urine test me. When they did I used someone else’s piss. Now almost 4 months have gone by. I’ve spent all the money I saved while working in the program. And I’m back on subs as of two days ago. And I hate subs. But I need to travel so can’t go on meth. I’m not sick but I don’t feel good. Still got the cold turkey shivers and sneezes and haven’t slept. Fml. 

Now to the point. The program (not the one I’m living in) that prescribes me the subsolv also gave me gabapentin, clonidin and some other bullshit. Knowing that I was going to suffer for 24 hours I took all 21 gabas and 10 x 1 mg clonidines. While it definitely helped with most all symptoms. I was so fuckin dizzy, shaking and light headed when I got up. At one point I forced my self to get some food in me and collapsed on the kitchen floor. My wife who thinks I’m still clean and just ‘sick’ right now was like wtf.

I've tried heroin in every other way, so basically the reason I'm asking is somewhat recently I came upon a decent amount of coke for cheap. Remembering the fact people drink coca tea, curiosity got the best of me and I brewed some regular tea and threw about a half gram of coke in there. I had a nice numb mouth and throat, slowly came up into a really smooth and clean coke high for about 3 hours, then slowly chilled without any real come down. 


It was a good experience, I was impressed especially by duration and smoothness, kinda got me wondering what oral heroin is like, anyone got some experiences? I've always found the different ROAs of a lot of drugs, especially meth, coke and heroin are all slightly different highs. It's more pronounced in something like coke than heroin, for example crack vs snorting coke has a lot more of a difference in high than smoking black vs snorting monkey water but they still kinda have a difference, atleast I feel so.


If anyone has done oral heroin is the body high better, worse? How long did it last? Length of come up and any other things about the experience you remember differed or you held onto?

edit: Also forgot to add I don't do heroin very often so my tolerance is fairly low. For example I currently have a decent opiate buzz off of kratom and a tall boy.",1553413802.0

I’ve been having this issue for a couple weeks now.

Anyway, I’ve recently gained access to some opana 10mg IR’s and the nods have been great besides the times where I can’t sleep because of the damn itching. I’ve tried various antihistamines, such as around 1 ml of promethazine, around 50 mg of diphenhydramine, and 20 mg of Loratadine. None of these have helped with the itching very much and I haven’t noticed a stronger high either. Does anyone have any suggestions on doses or in what manner I should be taking the antihistamines so that they can do their job and help me not scratch my balls off?

Do you think it would be necessarily dangerous to use some oxy every 3 (or more) days, meaning 2 break days in between dosing? I’m talking about a very low dose, 5 mg, which I would take orally just before work. While I do work with machinery, all I really do is walk around and sit down to complete monotonous mind-numbing tasks. As you can imagine, this is often very boring and tedious. I really love the oxy body high, but honestly I don’t love it enough to do it aaaaall the time (psychs are my favorite, although due to how lengthy trips tend to I’ve only been able to trip 17 times in the past 10 months). I currently smoke weed and vape nic every day which is the only thing I do daily, with every other drug I like it space it out by at least a day or two. For example, I’ll do oxy one day after work, then dxm + weed and nitrous the next day, then take a bar the next day, then do shrooms, etc. so I keep my tolerance for every drug low and as a result spend much less for a variety of different highs every week. Anyway, I mainly wanted to ask if anyone believes I shouldn’t be operating machinery at all on only 5 mg or if you think this is a recipe for disaster and will ultimately lead to opiate addiction.

b4t2fv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/b4t2fv/iv_questions/,7,https://redd.it/b4t2fv,InnocentOJwithPulp,IV questions,"Alright, so this is not my first time IV'ing but I have some questions as I am generally having some serious issues prepping my shot and end up wasting at least 3 syringes in the process. Someone help me with my process and tell me what I'm doing wrong. I have some ideas though. 

So I'm shooting meth and heroin. Sometimes seperate, sometimes together. I'm using a 31g, 0.5 cc, 5/16 inch bought off Amazon. Before this I was trying to use way too big of a guage (22g) which for a newbie was extremely rough. So with the whole Amazon inventory at my disposal I knew the higher number gauge the smaller the point so I just went with 31. 

So, my issues today. I tried to do a .3g shot of straight meth (I've done this amount before, nothing to worry about) and it was getting clogged, I guess? So Im assuming its either the 0.5cc capacity or the 31 guage was just not able to handle that shot? Probably both contributing cause after my 3rd wasted syringe, plenty of wasted dope. I finally just backloaded another clean syringe with far less product maybe .15g used all 50 units and shot fine. 

Which brings me to me next question: filters. Those first couple I messed up I was trying to filter the shots. I know people say its not necessary with meth but I would rather do it. I guess I just dont know how and I dont know if that was contributing to the clogged rig. I would use a brand new cotton swab. Dip it into my solution spin it around to soak most of it up and then push the tip of the needle into the center and draw back. Sometimes this causes little air bubbles  in the barrel that look too much like tiny strands from the cotton and freak me out. So, second question is.....I guess, how should I be filtering. More specifically where in the cotton should I be putting the point....and yeah, the first question too. Please suggest some rig specs that would be more suitable for my next purchase. Thanks fam I know I mainly asked about meth here but I had just as much trouble preparing a goofball tonight as well. And you guys are my favored sub anyways.

They're honestly everything I thought
IV heroin would be. I remember my first time shooting heroin and being like wow... really? This is it ? 

Then i remember getting sold dillies when i was dopesick once. Did a shot and thought I had overdosed. Now THATS an opiate rush.

All I do now is dillies for the most part. They're everywhere in my city, dirt cheap. 

You gotta space out shots though, and theyre more about the rush than the high. I only do 2x8mg dillies a day. One in the morning after breakfast (around 10am) and one in the evening after dinner (around 8pm). Any less time than that and I am left disappointed to say the least. 

I've tried doing 2 8mg dillies in one shot and honestly it didn't make the rush that much better. Defs got me higher but meh. 

What im saying is IV dilaudid is legit the bees knees. The other day I had about half a point of some decent h and an 8mg dilly shot and it was bliss. If i was at a point in my life where I could tweak out for any amount of time I would have added some meth or coke and really would have danced with Jesus.

And a lot of the same questions get asked all the time.

**IMPORTANT** Determine what kind of dope you got. In the US, you will almost always have BTH (tar/gunpowder) or ECP (powder). These are both heroin #4. If you live anywhere else, you will most likely have heroin #3.


Heroin #4 dissolves readily in water. #3 needs citric acid to be water soluble. This only matters if you’re shooting or plugging.


**INSUFFLATION**


*What you need: heroin, razor, tube (optional)*


Heroin is almost never hard to break, the razor just makes it easy to make bumps. A card would work too. If you have never done heroin before, 10mg or a match head sized bump is a good place to start. Sniff it – don’t snort it – you don’t want to be tasting a ton of it. You can chase this with a little bit of water or saline. Keep adding a bump every 20 minutes until you’re satisfied.


**INTRAVENOUS**


*What you need: heroin, cooker, sterile water, cotton, needle, tie*


Draw up approx. 30 units of sterile water, squirt into cooker. Put your dose in your cooker. If you have #3, add citric and cook. Mix with syringe plunger. Draw up through small cotton. Tie off and insert needle towards you (bevel up). Pull back on the plunger a little to register. Depress plunger.


Noobs should NEVER start here. If you insist on starting here, you’re doing 1 mg. Take your insufflated dose, cut it in half 3 times. Cut it in half again if it still seems too big. This is safe. Remember, **you can always do more, you can never do less.**

**PLUGGING**


*What you need: heroin, cooker, sterile water, oral syringe*


Repeat cooking process above. Draw up and insert rectally. Start with 5mg. It’s nearly as strong as Iving. Not quite, but has a similar rush. The rush may make you nauseous, remember.


**SMOKING**

*What you need: tar heroin or #3, foil, tube, lighter*

Bend piece of foil to have a V shape. Put piece of dope at the beginning of the V and tilt the furthest end down. Like eating a foil hotdog. Chase the dope down the slope with the lighter. The flame should not touch the foil. Inhale with the tooter in your mouth, chasing the smoke. You can smoke #3 in an oil burner (aka meth pipe). Half a pea sized dose.

# 160 Days Clean

Since a falling out with my sponsor around 90 Days Clean, I haven't been attending Narcotics Anonymous very much. However, I'm happy to report that I am still 160 Days Clean. I'm really excited about it. I'm almost 6 months clean and that's a big deal for me. My current support network is my Fiance, family, select friends, & my therapist.

# Employment

I used to be roommates with one of my friends and we had a falling out. However, after our falling out I offered an olive branch and acted as a reference for her so she could at least find employment after I had to kick her out of our apartment.

I've seen her a few times at functions with friends and have always been  ~~corgel~~ cordial  with her. To be fair when she left the apartment I had paid 3 months worth of her rent, so she owed me big time.

Well, sure enough 3 weeks ago I found out she was looking for someone to replace her at the non-profit she was working at. Despite knowing nothing about Accounts Payable, my friend talked me up to her boss as well to the CEO of the non-profit. I interviewed on a Monday and started that Wednesday.

So, my old roommate actually came through on her word that she'd make it up to me. She really out did herself. This is my first grown up job and while the work is NOTHING I'm passionate about, it's an easy job that I love. Especially with the down time I get. Today I was so caught up on everything, I got paid to just hang out and play on my phone.

Oh & my job pays in money. So, i'm slowly digging myself out of debt from my gambling and drug addictions.

# My Health

It's been 35 days since I last went to the ER which, is really excellent for me. Sure there have been days where i could've gone into the ER, but overall, I'm doing tons and tons better. I'm pushing through the distress of my vomiting too. Like my first day at work I vomited in the work bathroom 5-7 times. I seriously should've gone to the ER, I normally would've gone, but not messing up on my first day was really important to me. My friend was training me and covered for me - so no one but her knew i was sick that day.

Anyway, I'm excited things are getting better.

Just wondering what you would do.

I want to thank you all in advance. This board has been so helpful. I for one really appreciate it.

I am older and have dealt with chronic illness for almost 30 years. (Lupus and Rheum Arthritis as well as Connective Tissue disorder. Without my pain meds my lung function is 52%, with them I am fine, (connective tissie in ribcage).

After all these years I am obviously dependent and I dont mind. The second they find the cure and can keep me functional without pain meds I will go to rehab immediately.


My dose is not very high compared to others in my conditin. 3 30mg oxy and some Attivan and valium when needed. It is usually enough, unless I have a flare up.

This month has been unusually rough with a worse than usual flare and the pain has been excruciating.

I took an extra pill to 1.5 pills per day to cope and now I am going to be out 9 days before i can refill.

My old pain dr moved and i have not been with the new one long enough to be able to ask for an early refill.

The Govt agencies have doctors terrified to help with opiates right now anyway.

So my choice is to cop from dealers and risk getting a fake pill not to mention the huge expense OR
cut up a fent patch and gum the squares trying to get the dose close to the same. 

How does Fent patch feel compared to oxy?

I have seen the milligram calculator but is the pain killing effect the same?

The patch is too strong for me. ",1553378949.0

I'm Kiwi, and I wanted to share my story with you all...","For starters, I must tell you that my husband and I used to post on this sub a few years ago, and gradually became lurkers. When you spend so much time fucked up, it's easy to just forget about the little things when the only thing on your mind is getting more fent. 

So anyway, it's really just a standard story. It was April of 2009. At this time, we really only smoked weed, did blow occasionally, and would dabble here and there with some pain killers. Nothing too outrageous, we were in a good place. He is a union ironworker, I was a stay at home mom, and we had our shit together, had a place to live, two cars, and paid our bills. 

My husband went to the store one day, like I said, April 2009. When he got there, he pulled up a few parking spots away from a man in a truck, and another car pulled up on the other side of the truck. My husband had already got out of the car and was heading to the door, and he watched as the guy in the other car just casually walked up and shot the guy in the truck right behind the ear in the head with a pistol at point blank range. The shooter immediately turned the gun on my husband. At the time, we were told 97% of people flee and 3% fight back. My hubby was one of the 3% and fought off the shooter, but in the process, he took a bullet through his hand that shattered the metacarpal bones in his hand and destroyed most of the nerves in his pinky. The hand surgeon was able to do a pretty damn good job of fixing him up, but because of his line of work and constant use of his hands to tie rebar and pack it out...

Guess what, y'all? He was prescribed an endless flow of Lortab 10s, 180 a month at first. We partied down on those for a week or so, when hubby decided they weren't cutting it for the pain. A trip back to the doctor got him... 30mg morphine, 60 per month... ON TOP of the 180 Lortab 10s! Hurray for us, we were in heaven! Who prescribes two narcotics and that many at that dose for a hand surgery?!

After about three months of constant use, the hubby decided it was time to step up our game. We were going to sell those weak ass painers and go harder. The hubby found a plug who was selling those sweet, sweet Oxycontins for a too-good-to-be true price.... And we dove right in to smoking 80s like they were going out of style. At least 6 a.day, for months. Then they literally went out of style for us with the formula change. That very day, hubby got ahold of a plug for heroin. 

I'm going to skip ahead here to about 2014, and by then, we were smoking no less than a gram of dog a day, but still managed to have a roof over our heads and cars. One day, hubby came home from work and said, ""He got this new white shit in that is absolute fire!"" Say hello to fentanyl, baby, this shit is gonna rock your fucking world!

And it did. By 2016, 2017... We had lost everything, had signed temporary guardianship of our two sons over to my parents due to CPS involvement, and were living in cheap motels, or sleeping in our car. We were pathetic, destroyed, and had no will to live. We did this shit until literally this month... March 1st, my husband was arrested by state police and charged with two counts each of dealing in meth and cocaine and possession of both as well. In this state, I don't know why, it's cocaine instead of fentanyl. Either way, he's facing some time. The only thing he has going for him is that his only other felony in his life was from when he was 19, and he's 36 now. 

And that, you guys, was all it took for me to get ahold of a sub and wean myself slowly to nothing in a week. So I am clean and sober from that shit that took everything from me. I am starting completely from scratch, living with my parents, no car... But I can honestly say that I feel fucking amazing! I have never felt better, looked better, or been more determined to get on my grind and be what I know I can be... a better woman, a better mother, a better provider... I am on track to have a normal life again, free of that bitch called addiction. I hope maybe some of you active users can kick this shit yourselves. As good as getting fucked up may feel, it really doesn't compare to sobriety. Stick to chronic, y'all!!

UK,"So yesterday I went to see my GP to get my regular prescriptions and he gave me (probably by mistake) a blank prescription on my name.

All the details are there, aside from medicine requested, prescriber and date.

I was wondering if I could fill it up with a pen and use it to get some oxycodone? I actually really need it for chronic pain, but GP doesn't feel like prescribing it yet.

Do you think the pharmacist will buy it? Here in the UK prescriptions are normally filled electronically. Personally I have never seen one filled by hand.

I mean what's the worst case scenario? That the pharmacist says I am sorry I can't take this prescription?

Do they have a database where to check if the prescription was actually issued and by whom?

Thanks

Added: Thanks for the information guys. As far as I can see it looks like a big risk and I can't take up no croma charges nor I can fuck up my GP's trust. I'll just trash it I guess. Thanks ",1553365280.0

Longtime lurker but I thought I'd make a post here since I've seen a lot of kids getting into this thinking this is a fun game or believe they won't get stuck in this bullshit mess. Odds are you will so listen up. Here are a few rules or tips you should follow or you will end up like me. If you use hard drugs and/or mix you will end up in one of three places: JAIL,INSTITUTION, or DEATH. That is the most important thing you NEED to know before getting into this. A lot of kids are coming on here trying these substances and thinking they will not get stuck. IF you do opiates and/or mix drugs enough times, you will develop a dependence and become addicted. I am not here thinking I am holier than thou or glorifying this shit because it's stupid. Just thought I'd come on here and speak some truths as I abuse multiple substances and need to follow own advice, as I am in the midst of this. There's nothing cool about this crap. Some may have a legitimate reason to using but there is a sad truth to taking opiates regularly. Some chronic pain patients who actually need this are hopelessly suffering from a dependence. There is nothing cool about this crap. Taking people's meds, having a little party out with the friends, or even using alone will get you stuck and push you back/ hinder your goals and progress. BELIEVE me. You are hurting the people around you whether they tell you or not and you will lose family/friends.  Here are a couple of rules and/or tips you need to know to soften the blow of the people around you:

&#x200B;

1. GET A JOB. If you are going to do this and play around fund your own habit. No one likes a bum who has to free load for their shit. There are a lot of functioning addicts that people fail to talk about. This is partly because there is so few of them and/or the shame that comes with this game as a whole.
2. GET YOUR OWN SPOT. No one likes an addict living at home that doesn't provide in one shape or form. If you live at your folks' house, make sure you hold your ground and do some dishes/wash your laundry.
3. BE CLEAN. Make sure you keep clean with hygiene but also try to keep what you are doing on the low. Out of sight, out of mind works here even though it's a bit of a catch 22. No one wants to find your supplies and drugs that you left out. This is just a reminder that you are an addict and a fuck up in their eyes. 
4. BE HONEST. No one likes a liar but I know it comes with being an addict. Be as honest to people as you can be. Also, be brutally honest with yourself about where you are with your habit/addiction.
5. BE SAFE. If you're going to mix drugs, do it as safely as you can be and avoid messing up. Practice harm reduction and read up on the things you are taking. Bad combos include: alcohol with benzos, alcohol with opiates, opiates and benzos, alcohol with benzos and opiates. I call these death combos. If you are going to mix these use extra caution and less of the substances to achieve your high. Mixing these is a math equation. Get it wrong and you overdose or die. 
6. GET HELP. Addiction is a disease we need to treat it as such. Even though you think you have it under control, chances are you are teeter tottering with a habit that leads to addiction. If you are using to escape try to find someone that may help you overcome your demons or any underlying mental illnesses you may have.
7. BE HEALTHY. If you are using and mixing drugs, you are manipulating the chemicals in your brain so take extra caution. Work out and practice meditation for healthy physical and mental health.

This is all I have for now but will edit this post if I come up with more things to watch out for. If you are playing with opiates, you are playing with fire. Mixing substances is also frowned upon but we continue to do so. Might as well do it  properly. The people around you have/will notice. This road only leads to the three mentioned above. Be safe and be an honest person. This community is good because it is non judgemental and helpful. Listen to your peers because it is more serious than you think. If you have any questions or tips to add on, mention them in the comments below. Refer back to this post at any time. It is relevant as long as you are using and mixing.",1553363929.0

I'm 23. I first tried opiates when I was 15. I took 10mg and I was hig has hell. I did opiates a few times over the years but didn't pick up a habit until last year.

Starting in 2017 I started doing drugs heavilly. I dated a girl who was a full blown alcoholic and took adderall & klonopin everyday. I got into mixing addy and benzos everyday. Then I took a break, then eventually resumed taking addy, benzos, alcohol, and marijuana daily. Ended up just going on a year long adderall binge till last year. Then I got a plug for opiates, and ended up getting into opiates around November last year. From November until January I took around 10MG of percocet daily.

Around January I began taking 15mg daily. I would take 10mg percocet around late morning/early afternoon then redose 5mg percocet in the evening. I did this until February. Then I started taking 20mg everyday, and 5mg in the evening to redose. 

I lurk this sub all the time and I can't relate to any of the posts. I've read lots of posts about people who take 30-150mg of oxy a day. Me personally the largest amount of oxy I've ever taken at once was 30mg and that's only a few rare occassions like my birthday. Also people seem to redose large amounts, I usually take  my biggest dose in the morning ie 20mg then I'll take another 5mg in the afternoon, then finish off with another 5mg in the evening. Does anyone else do that take their biggest dose, then take smaller doses to redose i find it brings back the 20mg. Also I don't like nodding out I just like the eupohria and energy from percocet, and it removes my anxiety, and allows me to function in society since I use to be a massive alcoholic.

Also I forgot since February I've been taking adderall daily. I usually make a 30mg pill of adderall last me 3-5 days. I break the pill and snort lines. I snort about 5mg of adderall daily as well as 20-25mg of percocet. Sometimes I'll snort 7mg addy, most I've ever snorted is 10mg of addy.

When I don't have any drug tests upcoming I dab high quality wax damn near all day. Also I'm heavill addicted to nicotine use to smoke 2-4 black n milds as well as 5-7 cigaretts a day. Now I hit my vape all day, and bum cigs whenever I can even offer to pay I hate buying a whole back I'd rather pay a dollar a cig so I don't hve the whole pack as I'll smoke it all then buy another. 

My friend who introduced me to opiates, has been addicted for 3 years and takes about 10-25mg daily. Most he's ever taken in the past 3 years is 30mg. Is there anyone else who takes low amounts of opiates only? I make decent money, but I have lots of bills, and two business I'm involved in so I can't afford to divulge too much money on drugs my current habit is crazy to me as is, costing me about $400-$500 a month sometimes it sucks but it helps me.

TLDR: Trying to figure out if anyone has a similar opiate addiction to me. I indulge every day but only take 15mg-30mg daily along with 5mg of addy daily.  Former Chronic Alcoholic, and use to consume 15-20mg addy xr, 1mg kpin, and 10-15 shots daily. ",1553359292.0

I took a 10mg percocet, and about half of a blue or what was left. So the most I've consumed is about 20-25mg I'm guessing.

I've got some 0.5 klonopin, and about 10 milligrams of adderall. I want to know if I can pop/snort a .5 kpin or half a .5 kpin. As well as snorting 5mg-10mg addy.

Then If I can find a dealer I'll probably take another 5mg-10 oxy.

My pain doc had me on morphine ER 30mg 2x/day (I took my first one around 9am, second around 4 or 5pm.m) along with Oxy (IR) 15mg 2x/day for about 10 months and upon receiving a genetic test that shows which pain meds my body metabolizes best, it showed that I metabolize Morphine ultra fast and hence would need a higher dose to get pain relief so he essentially said fuck that and instead upped my Oxy IR 15mg to 3x/day and didn’t write another script for Morphine. 

The past few days on just the Oxy I have felt like an utter train wreck / incredibly sick involving virtually every body system / raging insomnia, clocking in about 2 hours of sleep night. 

Is it possible that even though my opiate receptors are still being fulfilled that I could be experiencing withdrawal symptoms from cold turkeying the Morphine? (Of which I barely felt shit from but am now realizing  maybe it at least helped me sleep and mildly controlled my pain; my pain is much worse now). 

Orrrr could this be a fluke / coincidence and I have some acute viral thing happening?

I have severe premature ejaculation issues.like 30 seconds max when I’m 100% sober. I’ve been trying to only have sex on opiates for the past 5+ years, primarily oxycodone because it seems most effective at delaying ejaculation and it gives me a good 4-8 hour window to have sex and last 20-40 minutes while being rock hard with zero loss in sex drive. It’s a godsend in my opinion. Occasionally I run through my script in 10-15 days and then forced to have sober sex with my gf which reverts back to 30 seconds and she thinks something is wrong every time cuz she has no clue for the past 5 years that I use opiates lmao. But honestly I’ve tried all the little tricks, numb creams, masturbate earlier in the day, viagra, squeezing PC muscles and all that BS that never works at all. Hydrocodone is okkk (better than nothing), H is pretty effective but I sometimes get too drowsy and last almost an hour which pisses off my gf. But something about pure oxy just is completely perfect. Can anyone shed any light on why it chemically works so well or do others feel the same way as I do? My doctor is considering taking me off my script since it’s been a few years of being on it and thinking about switching me to gabapentin which in NO way helps with sex. I’ve bought some just to try it out so see if it would help and it was maybe 35 seconds instead of 30 lmao. No way am I switching to that without a fight. But I’m overall trying to find a logical route to last a long time because it’s important to me and my relationship. ",1553331505.0

So my DOC is pharmaceuticals (specifically opiates) and I had lots in my possession, I started the on a few clonazepam I haven’t had morphine or opiates in so long that I tricked myself into letting it happen 

so I took morphine and in my benzo’d out mind I was “okay” took a lot more benzos and as any benzo user knows/slurrs “I don’t feel enough” I took at least 1-2mg more did not even let them kick in hardly took a shitload more morphine felt amazing... theeeen the full dose of clonazepam hit me and yikes...

I blacked out completely after that so this is all what I have been told/ascertained at this point: I took another 50mg morphine at least, possibly another 0.25mg clonazepam, then apparently went downstairs for water or food or sum shit. My girlfriend was rightfully worried when it took me 2 hours, when she came down i was completely slumped out in a chair she almost couldn’t wake me up, and basically had to carry me upstairs. I then slept like a rock for 9 hours. And to top it off I apparently puked in the fridge. 

I need to learn to be more careful if i end up relapsing in the future (hopefully not but im just being real) I don’t even think my girlfriend realized how close I was to dying. She said at first glance it looked like i just drunk fell asleep in a chair or something. 

I feel ashamed that I scared my girlfriend like that and I’m a little happy I do cause that’s one more negative I can attach to opiates

Stay safe everyone I almost died in my sleep and the only ones who know are you guys.

I got a paraphernalia charge a while back. I had my arraignment a few weeks ago and I signed some paper that said I'd abstain from alcohol and drugs.. but I haven't been convicted of anything yet.

I'm going to rehab the 29th and Monday I have a court date to extend my case so I can do rehab/outpatient.

I had 6 days clean until 6 days ago & then I was a dumbass and used again tonight (smoked .2-.3)

I've never dealt with any of this before so idk what to expect. It's my first drug charge would they likely still give me UA's? If so would they give me one on Monday after court? If I failed it, what would they do? Do I go to jail? Lol

A line in the morning to get through the work day, once at night cuz at that point i just wanna fucking sleep. it was fine cuz at least i was in control of my emotions. Sure i was miserable when it all wore off, but i was miserable before i started using and at least now i had a way to make it all better. At this point im still fine with being a junkie. Im not getting sober for myself. I always hear about how selfish addiction is, and at this point I really don't care about anyone else. All I really wanna do is snort dope and die, but I still gotta try. If I don't then I'm just a liar whenever I say i care about other people. 

Ive been trying off and on to get sober. Im at my longest streak right now with over 2 weeks. The vomiting and diarrhea have stopped, but I'm still a fucking wreck. I'm tired all the time, getting out of bed horrifies me, and as soon as I get to work I just wanna say “fuck you all, I'm out” quit, go home, wrap myself in a blanket and cry. My brain is fried and I feel like it's not gonna get better.

I got into a fight with my girlfriend on the phone about some mondaine bs the other day. I don't know if it was a combination of being at my soul crushing office job and getting yelled at for something I really didn't understand, but something just snapped and I went to the bathroom and just threw up. I told my job I had food poisoning and drove home as fast as I could and just cried. I pounded kratom hoping that could help, but that stuff does pretty much nothing for me. I've almost broke down and bought dope multiple times this week, and it's probably an act of God that I haven't. 

I dunno, I just gotta vent to someone and it's not like I can talk to anyone of my friends or family. I'm not gonna be known as the junkie in the group. And what can they do anyway? Im not gonna be a burden on anyone. I know everyone is gonna just tell me “it gets better”, cuz that's what everyone says about everything.

And a lil more info i only done 4 40mg oxys (cut em in half) over like 2 weeks a few months ago and i have 0 tolerence to any opiate. The first half 40 i took had me nodding pretty damn hard but only that 1st one - but now i have not a tiny bit of tolerence

&#x200B;

Has anybody had any experience of a prickling sensation on the skin of your lower face/jaw when doing dihydrocoideine?

&#x200B;

Im doing 30mgs at a time, one an hour for like 4 hours, and then i wont do any for 5ish hours. I dont feel much respiratory depression at all from this, just a tiny bit.

&#x200B;

Is it possible i am compensating for the slight respiratory depression by overbreathing and causing the prickling that way?  The prickling only comes sometimes when i do DHC alone, but when i mix it with weed it comes every time.

&#x200B;

Or is this some other problem i should be aware of?

I explain below why and would love for others to talk about how they’ve handled short/ medium term pain management issues. I’ve recently had an MRI regarding bad pain in my right knee and it was discovered I had a meniscal tear in the posterior horn of medial meniscus. Primary doctor recommended pain management because OTC and RX strength ibuprofen/ naproxen/ acetaminophen weren’t working and seem to exacerbate a pre-existing IBS-D diagnosis because I’ve had to take them often with very limited relief. I also have an orthopedic surgeon from a previous left knee meniscal tear/ subsequent meniscal repair via an arthroscopy. Her assistant gave me a cortisone injection on the knee a day ago with no decrease in pain so far. That’s a brief background to what I’m asking now: if everyone knows about my short term pain management plans for the next 2-3 months regarding physical therapy/ pain meds as needed/ monthly follow ups w/ primary care doctor and quarterly follow ups with orthopedics, am I covering all bases correctly. I’m someone only using the med (Roxicodone 5mg IR) as needed before PT/ work because the pain has increased exponentially in the past few weeks/ months and it doesn’t get me “high” at all but was concerned because of the severe restrictions everywhere, people may be quick to judgment, despite my daily life suffering greatly due to this new pain after left knee surgery 4 months ago. I should mention I’m very transparent and responsible spacing all the meds out properly so nothing bad happens and my whole team knows exactly what I’m taking. (Roxicodone, clonazepam, temazepam, lomotil, hyoscyamine, vitamin D, ibuprofen, pantopeazole aka I’m a spoon or fighting through several issues so sorry to go on. Just trying to get perspectives from others battling through severe pain in the short term. Any feedback would be very much appreciated!",1553288223.0
