 * Heroin - $50/gram of amazing tar, $80/gram of dry brown powder (decent)
 * Hydromorphone - $40 got a redditor 8 x 4mg M4 tablets and five B&D 1cc syringes
 * Morphine - generally around $0.20 / mg at any amount, from 100mg to multiple grams
 * Oxycodone - $0.30/mg here, sometimes up to $0.50/mg for brand name (Oxycontin 80mg would be $40)
 * Hydrocodone - 10mg tabs for $4 all day
