I decided to keep this account for now. For some reason.

I wrote this while very high 3 days ago, planning to post it here:

**Background Info**

I've been using heroin on and off for about a year and a half. Plugging mostly. I've tried snorting and it had very little effect, and I don't have the equipment or the right kind of H to smoke it (I still did once try to smoke it off foil - unsuccessfully).

I've had a codeine habit for many years now. It started with lower doses and once or twice a week, then it gradually developed. I cycled between taking it every second day, taking it every day, and going through withdrawals. 

When I started using heroin I alternated the two. Soon I realised I did not have the money for a heroin habit, and had to rely on codeine again.

After a period of regularly taking very large doses of codeine and getting sick from it, I limited my dosages. But I still continued using it as much as I could.

I also bought small amounts of heroin whenever I could afford it. I would plug it a few times a day and it would last me 2-3 days, then I'd go back to codeine. I have weaned off opiates completely a few times.

I decided to try shooting up - to see what it's like and hopefully get the same effects as plugging while using less (saving money) and having it last longer. 

I got all the supplies I needed last week, and I did a successful test run with just water. I'm grateful for all the online resources and redditors who gave me advice.

I got the package of H delivered yesterday and I successfully injected heroin for the first time. I waited an hour or so and did another shot. 

I did the same thing today, had one shot, waited to see how it went, and then emptied the rest of the bag to make another shot.

I got through 100mg of apparently pure #4 in two days. I don't know if this is a lot, but guides I've read say 5-15mg is a usual dose for someone with no tolerance.

**Observed Effects**

- I didn't get an instant rush like in the movies - at first I thought I must have done it wrong and it wasn't gonna work.
- Initial rush built up over a few minutes - it was probably 30 seconds or less before I felt the initial effects and then it peaked after a few minutes.
- Caused flushing/redness on the face and neck and feeling hot.
- The rush was not as intense or euphoric as I expected. It did feel good, but it took a few minutes to peak so it happened while I was putting away all my equipment and I felt a little incapacitated, but the feeling didn't last long. It was, however, intense enough to make me worry that I'd had too much. Then once it wore off I realised I wasn't really all that high.
- Other than the initial effects, very similar to plugging, except less is needed and it lasts longer.
- Nodding hard and feeling like I might pass out but can still lie awake for hours just enjoying the comfort/calm.
- Strong desire to fight the urge to sleep.
- Can't focus vision for reading or writing - must close one eye to focus (could be side effects from meds and/or vision problems I have, both exacerbated by heroin).
- No nausea.
- Itchiness - I enjoy scratching - doesn't happen every time though.
- Hard to keep eyes open / open eyes once they are closed.
- Mind keeps drifting - hard to focus.
- I can function and act normally when I get up to make food/interact with people.
- No noticeable effects on coordination like with benzos.
- Also no apparent memory loss.
- Doesn't take all depression away - just takes the edge off.
- Helps my anxiety - calm, relaxed, more confident.
- Different kind of sedation / relaxation than benzos. Sometimes I don't notice much effect from benzos unless I'm treating high anxiety, and if I take a huge dose I get very sleepy and feel no desire to fight the urge to fall asleep, and so I just sleep.
- Definitely gives me more of a high than benzos.
- Soothes any irritation or agitation.
- Increases my interest in things and also reduces my ability to hold my attention so my ADHD worsens and I try to do several things at once and keep forgetting what I was doing.
- Losing my train of thought a lot but I worry less about forgetting things - this is usually a source of anxiety for me.
- Everything seems easier - more motivation, mundane tasks can be fun.
- A lot of mental imagery - vivid visual and sound imagery, and dream like thoughts and images.
- Being lost in thoughts that make no sense.
- I ""wake"" from these dream like states and think how weird and nonsensical the thoughts/images were.
- Not exactly euphoric, but I rarely experience euphoria - codeine is possibly more euphoric for me but it's very short lived.
- Reduction in negative thoughts - more neutral / reflective thinking.
- Some mild closed eye visuals.
- I don't get munchies but I feel like eating because the pleasure is enhanced.
- I rarely get nauseous from H, even when I've been nodding hard. But I have thrown up a few times from taking large numbers of codeine pills (not CWE - just swallowing the pills).
- I don't get hiccups like I do with codeine.
- All my physical ailments feel better.

In some ways plugging is better - hard to explain - but it's worth it to get better value out of the bag.

At first I felt guilt and shame about my first time shooting up ... then I realised this is because of the stigma, negative stereotypes, and myths.

Now I feel good about doing it. Now I know it's an option, and now I know I can master injecting myself and it makes me feel in control.

I've fantasised about shooting up heroin for years (mostly as escapism, but I'm also fascinated with needles), but kept telling myself I would never do it, because I don't even know how, and people say that the instant rush gets you hooked and after that nothing will ever compare. 

Well now I can say that's not true for me, at least. I would definitely still prefer plugging or taking codeine at times. And there are many situations I prefer other drugs. Opiates aren't to me very social drugs; I only ever do them at home by myself. And benzos are much more of a necessity for me than opiates.

I also still think LSD is my favourite recreational drug. And Ketamine is a very different kind of drug but I would prefer it over shooting up heroin. It's even more expensive, but provides way more escapism (so much so that, depending on the dose, it's not the best drug to take if you want to be able to function).

*(I think I wrote this part as a sort of response to the people who reacted negatively to my post about planning to try injecting)*

I wouldn't encourage anyone to try any drug. But instead of trying to influence someone's decision, I would listen to what they have to say, and answer any questions, focusing on harm reduction, and refer them to resources, since I have limited knowledge. I would also share personal experiences but emphasise that it's different for everyone. 

I believe in bodily autonomy and personal freedom, so people being able to do what they want with their own bodies fits with my values.

But I also respect the seriousness of drug addiction as a mental illness, but this post will be too long if I get into that.

*Prologue*

Firstly, I wouldn't recommend injecting heroin. It's not that great. Movies make it seem way more fun than it is. I've had way better times on LSD. Opiates as a whole are very addictive regardless of whether they are any fun or not. For me, they are less fun and more a coping mechanism. The addiction can develop very gradually. The pleasure of using is heightened exponentially when I'm going through withdrawal. Once I'm out of the withdrawal phase, I don't crave it as much and if I relapse it's usually because I'm trying to suppress emotions. I think maybe as an addict I'll always want it even though I know it's not that good. When I'm using a lot I can't imagine life having any meaning without it. But a lot of that has to do with depression too.

I think the message I really wanna get out is harm reduction and part of that is ending the stigma. Another huge part is access to mental health care, safe injection clinics, free access to sterile needles and other supplies, decriminilisation, and I'll go even further to say (regulated) access to pure, pharmaceutical grade heroin, so you know what dose you're getting, you can taper using heroin under the supervision of a doctor if that's how you choose to get off it, the street market becomes mostly redundant, users are less stigmatised, maybe users don't have to spend as much money to support their addiction if it's sold in a regulated rather than a totally free market, and maybe their lives aren't totally ruined by what is a treatable mental illness.

But most of that is my utopian dream world.

*Here's what I did right*

- I did a lot of research. 
- I followed https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Safer_injection_guide.
- I asked for advice here (some gave very helpful advice, others told me I'm a disgrace). 
- I went to the chemist and got sterile needles (as part of a needle exchange program), alcohol wipes, cotton buds, and sterile containers for mixing.
- I used heroin from a trusted vendor that I'd used before (I also should have tested the batch using a different ROA before injecting).
- I got distilled water to dissolve it in. The pharmacist said it would be in the laundry section at the supermarket, and that's where I found it. 
- I poured the heroin into the sterile container, then I filled the syringe about halfway with distilled water, which I squirted onto the heroin. Then I used a cotton bud to mix it and used the same cotton as a filter (should have used a better mixing tool and a better filter). I drew the solution up through the cotton, then got rid of all air bubbles.
- I made sure to keep everything sterile that was going to touch my skin.
- I used alcohol wipes on the area before and after injection (should have also applied bandaids).
- I started with a small dosage (should have been even smaller tbh).
- I was very careful about making sure I knew where the vein was, injecting at the correct angle and being sure I was in the vein (except for one incident below), then only injecting the smallest amounts in increments. 

*Here's what I did wrong*

- I didn't tell anyone I was shooting up heroin. 
- I did it alone, in the bathroom.
- I didn't acquire any form of naloxone in case of overdose.
- I didn't write a note to say what I'd taken in case of overdose.
- I didn't go to a safe injection clinic, which is available where I live.
- I tried injecting when I wasn't in a vein (need to see blood in the barrel to be sure). Luckily the liquid just seeped out of the hole I'd injected it into. A lot worse can happen.
- I tried to inject in through the same hole twice at a different angle to get into a vein. It was ultimately successful but led to a lot of bleeding.
- I didn't weigh the powder to get the right dosage (must get better mg scales).
- I forgot to untie the tourniquet before injecting (it is pretty difficult to do all this with two hands). Probably lead to increased bleeding, but worse can happen.
- Again, I did this alone, but also wrong for a different reason. This was my first time self injecting. I should have been with someone who knew what they were doing and could guide me. (I don't know anyone who uses heroin, which is probably a good thing overall).

I also decided to do this after I'd gone 3 weeks without opiates (purely due to lack of money and the 1 Feb change to make codeine prescription only), and then had two relapses with prescribed codeine, but not enough to cause any withdrawals. 

Now, after injecting heroin two days in a row and having no withdrawals, it's been 3 days, and I could keep it going, but I still want to do it again...",1520661474.0

To give you an idea, I harvested some #4 from my onion patch and snorted 50mg. For the first hour or more, I was sky high, but for the next 3, I was throwing up lunch, breakfast, and yesterday's dinner. I now keep my doses to around 20-35mg.

I gave my friend, who I've seen shoot a gram of some fire obsidian black and just be sorta chillin, little nod here and there, 200mg. He proceeded to shoot it all and couldn't complete coherent sentences. So strong stuff you know? I wouldn't say it's absolutely pure, those are only in hospitLs, but pretty up there.

Now my question is, how much oxycodone would I need to snort and/or eat to achieve the 20-35mg high? I like oxys more cuz I'm a stim guy, I like to get things done. Oxy provides a stimulating opioid experience that I refuse to adulterate with anything (except my beloved cLam). From my own experience, it seems they're pretty much 1:1.

What about you guys? Heroin or oxy? Also dose equivalency?",1520660758.0

I’ve found that if you take smaller does of subs (.2-.3) during the peak of ur addiction it won’t give you any PWD symptoms at all. I’ve been taking that much the last couple of days, and was wondering, once I finally run out of dope and plan on getting on the subs, can I take .15-.25 of subs every hour or 2 until I’m on a full dose of suboxone to avoid any kind of withdrawal? 

I don’t want to add any confusion with all the other shit I wanna say, so I’ll just leave it at that. Does anyone have any clue about this or any suggestions/websites/advice/etc to give me?? Withdrawals are completely hindering me from finally getting in subs. I get this weird withdrawal symptom to where I have these seizure-like-spaz-outs every 10 minutes that completely fuck me up. I hate them so much and they scare the shit out of me, so I’m deathly afraid to get sick (I’ve had enough money and live in a city where I haven’t had to worry about getting sick in a long, long, time) and the dope I do have legs of Olympic bikers. I can stay well for like 16-20 hours before I’m sick enough to take subs, but I’ll have the anxiety/stomach aches/depression for 8-10 hours of that time which really gets to me.

The two main ones I'm using are grapefruit juice and agmatine, and so for brevity I suppose this post will just involve these. What I'd like to know is, A., how much one should be taking to induce peak potentiation, and most importantly, B., the dose scheduling AKA the timing of potentiation. WHEN and HOW MANY TIMES do you use the potentiators? Do you take it:

* before dosing (how long before)

* when you dose

* after the dose kicks in

and do you repeatedly take it? 

Alright so it's just this: long story short, what are the exact instructions for exactly how much, when, and how often one is supposed to use the potentiator? I'm tired of having no idea if I'm wasting my potentiators or not or if there's just a way better way I should be doing it. Again, I'm seeking answers for grapefruit juice and agmatine. Unless there's another one that you swear by as being better (that is easily available and not sketchy), then I'd like to hear about that too.

NOT OD. I've got some hydro IR 15mg and some that are 20mg but have a protective coating making it harder for people to snort the drug. I've snorted 30mg and taken 20mg orally and also taken 4mg of ativan(I have a EXTREMELY high benzo tolerance, so that dose is nothing to me) over the past 11:30 hours. I'm pretty high and am nodding out if I'm not focused on something specific. I feel like I'm breathing fine. And am having very minimal trouble coordinating myself around the house. No slurred speech.
 My question is do you think it would be safe to break apart another 15mg and snort it at 5mg periods throughout the rest of the night. I have cool water, my albuterol inhaler, and my phone on my nightstand.

  I've taken 4mg of ativan(with a EXTREMELY high benzo tolerance), 20mg oxycodone orally, and snorted 2, 15mg oxys over the last 11.5 hours.

&nbsp;

A couple of days ago I bought dope with my buddy Tim and told Cliff I couldn't buy dope with him because I needed a tech certification. It was nice getting high without spending double. It was nice not paying a massive middler fee. It was nice not having to share and split the order after paying so much. 


Sure, I always got paid back for the dope I bought him but I can't put roxies into my bank account. Ever try paying a phone bill with roxies? Most carriers don't accept that form of payment. Also, if I have to wait two or three days for a potential buyer to get paid, by then I usually end up consuming those roxies.


&nbsp;


**I'm so happy** that I saved and have so much money left over from pay day.


Highlights of things I spent my money on:


* A low cost drone by recommendation of a member of this community.

* Stargate Command Membership.

* Some subs for myself.

* Tools for my bike.





**Attention Stargate fans**: Pay $20 for a SGC membership. Not only will you be able to stream every Stargate movie and TV episode but you will get a tee shirt!

I can't wait to get my Stargate tee shirt! 

Also streaming, new episodes of the new show, Stargate Origins. Sadly, the last three episodes just came out for streaming. Ten episodes total, I feel like it barely started and it's already over. The format is that of a bunch of short webisodes. Combined they equal a two part episode in length. 



&nbsp;

A Stargate Command membership enables to you view the episodes via the web and a mobile app. The app is available for both iOS and Android. 



Now, to shop for furniture for my turtles and that mercury vapor lamp. It's nice being not spending ever last dollar on dope and subs.


&nbsp;


I got the subs on D-day but I kept them for myself. I picked up a couple more that Cliff paid me for today and let him have those. From here on out, I'll be well. **Cliff gets paid mid week, if or when when he offers me free dope to borrow until I get paid, I MUST decline.** If I owe him for the dope, then I gotta pay for that + any dope that he wants on loan. Two weeks from now when I get paid again I must at least do as I've done this past week. 


I must not make any more of my money available to Cliff for dope. I'm very satisfied with the outcome of my most recent pay day and want things to go like that in the future as well.


&nbsp;


I don't know if I'll buy dope next pay day but I'm planning on not buying any dope. If I do, I'm definitely not getting it through Cliff because I never want to split an order with him again. I'm not responsible for his ability to get high and if he tries to offer me a loan this week I'll decline. It'll be that much more dope for him. 


Plus, I've already gone above and beyond to help him get subs and if he wants to pay for more in the not too distant future, I'd be happy to help him get more if it's not terribly inconvenient for me.

&nbsp;


I enjoyed getting high the past couple of days but I don't know if the high outweighs the negatives. Just two noticeable negatives. The skin around eyes gets itchy. I try to resist rubbing my eyes and I still end up rubbing them. This time I did an okay job of resisting but I still crossed the line with rubbing as is evident under my left eye 

I've been told that the dryness around my eyes was solely due to dehydration. Although it may be a factor, I do believe whatever the cause, I do exasperate it by rubbing around my eyes. The dryness/damage coupled with sleep deprivation causes me to get literal crows feet below my eyes. I know normal crows feet are different but I do get very distinct lines below my eyes.

&nbsp;


The lines go away after a few days of proper care and hydration once I stop taking dope and stop rubbing. Sometimes I put lotion on but I've learned that the skin ends up looking **way worse if you put lotion on damaged skin.** Skin must be allowed to heal before applying any moisturizing lotions.

&nbsp;


What I learned and experienced in concise points:



* The skin below my eyes get fucked up wen I rub them every single time I binge on dope.


* The brain feels weird during the first stage of withdrawal. Dreams too.


* I was able to take a sub just under 12 hours after my last dose. I always start with 2mg. 


* The 2mg of subs helped do the trick. Took a couple of hours to be able tell if it took effect but I felt psychologically well and good before I was done with my second cup of coffee.


* Probably didn't need to take 2mg more. Did anyway. 


* The itchy eyes and the negative mental state when running dry are my primary reasons to no buy dope in the future.


&nbsp;

I'm really glad that I saved so much money that I was able to spend money to invest in the future of the Stargate franchise. I'm also glad that I didn't have to experience full blown dope-sickness and enjoyed keeping my money.",1520651600.0

Did you have any problems? (not talking about tolerance or blockade really. but put that in if you want to. my tolerance is nil)

Was your pain controlled?


Did you encounter any problems with doctors or pharmacists?

Whenever I pressed the drip button, I felt a cool rush of fluid going into my arm. I could feel the fentanyl going through my shoulder and toward my heart. Then the sensation faded as the injection reached my body temperature. I had a pavlovian effect that made me feel high while the fentanyl was first penetrating my arm. Then came the rush. It was smooth and soothing as the narcotic invaded my willing mind. Pain flew away, and the room brightened. At night I saw colored dots swirling around the small TV. I couldn’t follow the programs that were on, and I mostly watched Cops and Forensic Files. Crimes were interrupted by commercials as often as by police. Little people crossed the little screen in little cars. Some were dragged off to tiny jails in the television that was smaller than a microwave oven. I had a remote control, but it kept falling off the bed, because my mattress was inflated and sloped down on the sides.

But in the matter of a week (I usually only use once a week) I started feeling little to nothing from it. At first I thought it was because of a few times I took subs (only twice) and I’m sure that was part of it. But last Saturday I took sub (4mg) and today I took 60mg hydrocodone and 100mg of IV benadryl and felt only a tiny buzz. What gives? The only thing I can think of is that around this same time I started taking duloxetine which is an SNRI for depression after my best friend basically broke up with me. It’s 20mg everyday. I have to take a temporary tolerance break since I can’t get anything for a minute cause my connect went to jail for for trespassing? It’s weird, but my psychiatrist doesn’t plan on keeping me on this medicine forever, it’s just temporary to help get over this loss. When I’m done with it, if opiates seem to work as great as they used to again then I’ll know it had something to do with SNRIs.  The only reason I think it might be something other than tolerance is because it was so dramatic and abrupt. Anyone else have experiences like this? With SNRIs and opiates and their interaction?

They are making opiods harder to get prescribed in the first place. i started using heroin at 17 because no doctor would prescribe me anymore than paracetamol for a herniated disc (where i live u dont get opiates unless ur terminal). what alot of people dont realize is that inadequate pain management is just as damaging as throwing around painkillers like skittles as they used to.

as much as i hate the pharma industry for purposefully promoting opiate prescriptions, the end result of cracking down on these pharma quality meds means people will increasingly resort to heroin-- where they dont know the dosage, purity or even the active ingredients. if people are going to do drugs, it was at least a form of harm reduction when people knew their doses, and werent being sold fentanyl in place of heroin. another consequence will be more overdoses.

by making drug laws harsher and restricting supply, price goes up. consequently more dealers are attracted to the market by higher profit margins, increasing supply and availability (it is in fact easier for teens in the US to acquire cocaine/heroin than it is to obtain alchohol!).

most health consequences stem from prohibition. opiates are non-toxic unless you overdose. only now people must resort to IV use to cope with artificially inflated black-market prices (a gram by the way costs 10 cents to produce), injecting god knows what cuts and increasing the risk of OD exponentially. even IV use of pharma grade diacetylmorphine poses little long-term health consequences, at least far less than a glass of wine a day.

if we were tasked with creating a system that made addiction worse-- we would design the same system currently in place.

what makes me sick is how the average person actually supports prohibition and a 'tough on drugs' mentality-- when that same mentality has increased drug use, addiction rates, overdoses and availability EXPONENTIALLY over the past century with no signs of improvement.

the only country with falling addiction rates is Portugal (where all drugs are decriminalized). In Canada, where trials have been introduced where addicts are increasingly prescribed diacetylmorphine (heroin), they are soon able to hold down jobs and support a family.

even in the philippines were drug use receives the death sentance, addiction rates rise.",1520642799.0

http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/911-good-samaritan-fatal-overdose-prevention-law

*From the link: 20 states & the District of Columbia have enacted policies to provide limited immunity from arrest or prosecution for minor drug law violations for people who summon help at the scene of an overdose. New Mexico was the first state to pass such a policy and has been joined in recent years by Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
Good Samaritan laws do not protect people from arrest for other offenses, such as selling or trafficking drugs, or driving while drugged. These policies protect only the caller and overdose victim from arrest and/or prosecution for simple drug possession, possession of paraphernalia, and/or being under the influence.*

So while those states do have laws to protect people who summon help to overdose scenes, other states may have laws called “Good Samaritan laws” but those are basically for underage drinking. 

I’m not saying abandon your friends to die. But if you live in certain states like Indiana you would be smart to call 911 and run if you have drugs or paraphernalia on you. It’s also smart to not mention drugs and say “they stopped breathing” because the 1st responders will have narcan anyways. 

 I have a friend who got charged with dealing H because they found his weed scale when he OD’d. I have another friend who got slapped with a felony charge (later downgraded) for possession of a syringe. So be careful out there and know the laws of where you live.

In the building you can use whatever drugs however you want be it injection, snorting, smoke, or even oral use (I think). Oh except for plugging. No butt stuff allowed. 

I went there yesterday as I had some hydromorphone already loaded in a rig and was too sketch to shoot in public like a washroom. I realized that the safe injection site was just a few blocks away so I figured might as well go there instead of trying to shoot in an alley or public bathroom.

I go to the site, introduce myself and basically said why I was there and what I was using. They read me their terms and conditions ect, and after signing a paper one of the workers there brought me into the room for iv use. There was 8 or so booths no one was in there except for another one of the workers. The guy in the injection room gave me a little tray with everything I needed, fresh rig, water, cooker, alcohol wipes and even a Band-Aid too. At this time I was starting to really feel my wd kick in so I decided to add more hydro to the premade shot I made that morning.

So mix, filter, bang, and then sweet oh so sweet relief. Talked to the one of the workers there for a couple minutes then said I had to go cause I was in a bit of a hurry at the time. Went back out to the front desk and they told me they're giving out $5 gift cards for everyone's first time coming to the place.

I also left with some clean supplies too, got some rigs, cookers, water, ect. Overall I thought it was really awesome. The staff there were super friendly too. It was a good experience and I'm glad I decided to check it out instead of shooting in public.

I picked up a passenger and it was a slow day so he was the only person on a 15 passenger vehicle. I wouldn't do this normally but the only connect I had was about 2, 2/12 hours away and my work required me to go to the city so sometimes I would try to meet a connect while going to the city from the mountains.

I needed to drop the person off near the airport but I ended up taking a 20 minute de tour in the city saying that we had to pick someone up before I dropped them off because it was the only way I was gonna be able to pick up. He was probably around 16 or so, I feel ashamed so don't tell me what a scumbag I was or possibly still am. 

Either way as I arrived to our ""destination"" I told him to hold on for one second as I try to reach the passenger as he is not answering the phone. I walk around the corner from where we are, score, get right back on the bus and make it in time for his drop with no suspicion all while putting my job on the line. I was pleased with myself at the time but looking back at it I regret it.

tl;dr daughter got really interested in the opioid crisis and researches the dangers of continuous opioid use and she loves talking to my family and I about it. Recently I have noticed signs that she might be using. Many more key details in full post.

Hi everyone. I just decided to create a reddit account because I feel that you all could be helpful in figuring out some things about my daughter. Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated so thank you in advance :)

I would like to quickly add that I am not the type of parent to be close minded that all drug use is inherently evil just because it is a drug. I have no problem with certain drugs such as marijuana or some psychedelics. Of course, I would prefer if my children would not do it. 

Here is the situation: I am the mother of 2 boys (22 and 19) and 1 girl (16 years old). My daughter has recently (past few months) taken a huge interest in the opioid crisis. She is one to research for hours on end about something she is interested in. She has no problem talking to my husband or I about it. She is generally a pretty closed off person and is very independent, but she loves talking to us about her new research topics and she loves to inform us and hear our opinions on it. I know every parent would say this, but she is so not the type to do drugs. She is very committed to school, she is very spiritual, she has many goals, and she knows what excessive drug use can do to a person. As far as I know, she has never drank, smoked, or done anything drug related.

When she first started talking about the opioid crisis to us, I was initially a little bit worried because she is such a curious person, so I decided to research signs of opioid use.

Over these past 30 days, she never hesitates to mention when speaking with us how bad continuous opioid use is harmful for the neurons in your brain and how she would never do them. She always mentions how she believes people get addicted and dependent because they are ignorant on how the drug works and how easily it is to get addicted. She says that the doctors need to inform patients better or people need to educate themselves like she is doing. She also likes to joke around with her brothers because they always mention how they could easily see her doing opioids because she talks about them so much. She has gotten super offended when she learned that one of her brothers was actually serious when he said that he could see her taking them.

Anyway, on to why I am writing this post in the first place. Since I researched how to recognize signs of opioid use, I have been more attentive to her actions and her looks. In the past two weeks, I have noticed some days where she is super tired and she does what you would call ""nodding"" occasionally. She also gets really happy sometimes. She is generally a super happy girl, so this might not be anything special. But what drove me to write this post was something that I saw tonight. She wasn't tired at all, she was energetic and super happy, but her pupils were completely pinpoint, even in the dark. Another thing, she also has recently been getting anxiety, which she hasn't really had before.

If you think she is using, how should I approach this situation? I don't know how to react if she is using. I don't want to get mad because I understand she is a curious girl. I would just be in shock and I would have no clue on how to approach talking to her about it.

I would love to hear your thoughts. Again, anything is appreciated! Thank you and have a great day.

Mathew Davis was an artist and writer who lived through the mass exodus from Detroit and before the Cass Corridor’s gentrification occurred. 

He was probably known to most as the guy who stacked stones on Belle Isle but he was also an inspired writer, photographer, as well as a dedicated harm reduction activist. 

He experienced some harrowing tragedies during his time as a homeless junkie, some poignant moments as well, and he wrote a lot of them down. You can read them by following the link below.  

I became an addict in part due to my curiosity which was piqued by artists who were addicts and people like Mathew Loflin Davis have always inspired me so I feel obligated to share his story and keep his memory alive.

1. The time I was in withdrawls and got hit by a car doing 40 mph. Jumped into the windshield and was sick in the hospital getting wounds flushed stitched and skin cut off untill the 3rd morphine shot. Took six weeks to get all the glass out of my back.

2. Getting sent to a mental ward by the police after they made me climb down out of a tree. Hospital staff stole my shoes then discharged me shoeless in Brooklyn after I got high in the bathroom. Blacked out and woke up on a bench outside the projects. Sunglasses and keys gone but wallet still there. Wierd. Couldnt find my car for 4 days. Amphetamine psychosis was my diagnosis. Laaaaaame.

So going to ""the city"" or anything like is no longer an option. Especially since i dont drive anymore (got my license suspended for 3 years). It is borderline impossible to find dope around my area, or pills for that matter.  
So, since i had already been quite familiar with the DN...i decided to order a few weeks ago. Ordered a half gram of BTH with overnight express shipping. Paid $60 for the half, and $35 for the shipping (outrageous i know, but im desperate) It got here in 36 hours and weighed 0.95g. I was stoked. Stayed high for a few days. I then decided to order another half gram, but also ordered a half gram of some fishscale the vendor offers...because, well because speedball. A week has gone by and no package...im pissed, opened a dispute to get my money back but that takes a week at least. So i placed another thursday morning since i had a bad feeling about the BTH and coke and bam today i get blessed with some firrrrre ECP...

My experience,"A couple of people have asked me to post this here, so i am. Please note I am not a doctor or expert.  Below is my experience, but I was amazed that i was able to kick H with one 8mg Suboxone strip.  I learned this method from others on this sub, so i have them to thank a million times for this.

I recently went on a 3 week run with heroin. I know it doesn't sound long, but it was IV use and I was taking 3-4 shots per day. Also, the people who taught me this used the same method to kick much larger/longer habits. I did it with one 8mg sub, but if you had two it might be better.

First, you need to wait at least 24 hours after you last use Heroin/Oxy use before taking the sub or you go into precipitated withdrawal, which sounds like complete hell. It actually has more to do with how you're feeling than the time, but I've been told 24 hrs is pretty safe.  If you're not familiar with precipitated withdrawal, google it. Also google COWS worksheet to test how far into withdrawal you are.  Basically you need the full agonist (heroin) out of your system before taking the sub. So you will have to deal with being sick for part of a day.

Once you're ready to induce, take the smallest amount needed to make you well. Take the 8mg strip and cut it into 8 equal slivers. Take one or two of those slivers and cut them in half. So you have a few .5mg slivers. Take one under the tongue and wait half hour. if nothing, take another, etc until you feel well. This part was a little stressful for me. Once i took the first bit i swear i felt worse so thought i was going into precipitated wd, but i wasnt. It took 2 mg to get me well that day. subs is a strong drug and you dont need as much as people think. so here was my daily use day by day:

2mg 1mg 1mg 1mg 1mg .5mg .5mg .5mg .25mg .25mg

I'm not saying I felt 100% well the whole time. But i would say i felt an average of 80% well throughout. Sometimes better sometimes worse.  When i dropped doses i felt it a bit, but it was manageable. I went to work everyday and participated in family events.  The worst day for me was the first day totally off the sub. but now I'm 3 days off and actually feel great. Also, i had ""comfort meds"" to help me on days when i felt kinda bad. these were xanax and pregabalin (lyrica).

If your use was heavier than mine, and if you have more subs, you might stretch it out a bit longer. But the idea is to get off quickly before you really get addicted to the subs.

I always went cold turkey before, but this method was really advantageous, particularly if you need to continue living your life while kicking.  Biggest potential drawback is that it relatively painless and relatively quick, so potential for relapse is high.  

I'm sure there are many opinions and other experiences about this, like I said I'm no expert.  but it totally worked for me.  I'm happy to answer any more questions if i can.  ",1520728875.0

Never got scripted by a doctor.. Only went to a clinic once and said fuck it not for me...

A close friend of mine gets strips and sells them.

My brother who I bought a house with gets subutex every month and had been giving them to me...
At first he got the orange ones.. One pill I could make last a week at least snorting small lines in the morning.. At lunch and at night..
This went on for awhile..

Then he got a different pill.. The fucking small 8ball subs all the sudden the lines I was snorting were stronger much stronger..
Before I know it a pill is lasting me two days..
And then it becomes a problem because he is running out of his medicine at the end of the month just trying to keep me and him from getting sick..

Now during this time I also would have moments where I'd take breaks and snort dilaudid.. Get a script for hydrocodone every month that I just sell..

Anyways after a year and a half of this he decided he wasn't going to give them to mee anymore..
I never was the type of addict to sell my stuff or let my life get out of control.
He basically put me on subs because we were getting a house together and he and his wife are both recovering addicts with a kid and he didn't want me bringing any kind of dope in the house I cant even have beer and stuff here. Working on finding a room to rent somewhere else right now..
But back to my original question....

I been off subs for two week..
I waited one week or a little less and got some dilaudid spent a week snorting about 16mg a day.. Didn't feel shit.. Got my hydro script...week 2 off subs.. Took 10.. 10s for a few days didn't feel shit..
The past few days I've only taken maybe 2 or 3 a day combined with gabapentin and Valium which I have a ton of both.. I'm down to my last 5mg of hydrocodone.. I've only taken 20mg combined today and that's about what i took yesterday too.. I expected to be sick by now but I think ice weaned myself off decently..
Tomorrow will be the first day with nothing..
Well.. I do have two tramadol but they might be gone before the nights over..

But shit I expected to get a feeling both times being it had been a week then two weeks off subs.

Those 8ball subs really fucked me.

When can I get high again? I feel like if I went and bought a roxie 30 tonight I might... But I don't want to risk it..
I just don't understand why i can't get high anymore.

Before subs I could make a roxie 30 last me a day... I was never that bad..

Now I'm considering snorting or smoking H for the first time just cause I want to get high again.

Even tho sub has saved my family members lives..
I was just a recreational user and it fucked me up. =(",1520723698.0

Long story, TL;DR

I know not many of y’all know me, but I been here for a while lurking and recently making post. Just need to rant.

So if y’all saw my post last night I was insanely fucked up and wanting to die, but luckily I made it back to my motel room, which I lose on Monday. 

Anyway I’ve been fooling around with this girl and last night she stole from me. I buy her food everyday, Roxie’s everyday, and drive her like a taxi. I rarely ever get any puss from her either. By no mean am I rich or have ever been rich. So not only am I financially unstable from my habit I’m now homless because of her. 

So back to the story, we had been doing 30s all day long and I usually don’t nod unless I shoot like 3 at once. Well yesterday I had went and gotten 2 Roxie’s for me and 2 for her at lunch time. Then I get call from a Friend of mine saying he wants me to middle. So I go pick him up and I get two more and her two more and my other boy and his wife 5. Well as we’re waiting for my dude to roll up, my girl pulls out like 30 xans and hands me 8. Me being a fucking idiot I take all 8.

So I thought cool I might get alittle high. Well next thing I know the person riding with that I’m middling for also hands me another 30 and 6 more xans after my dude showed up(all xan mentioned are .5).

Well I take those 6 xans as well because I wasn’t feeling the ones I took hours ago. So I shoot my 30 that was given to me and next thing I know I’m lights out cold. I wake up couple mins later and my girl is just straight gone and the husband to the girl I am middling for is sitting in the seat beside me where my girl was sitting. He woke me up and tells me she just got out of the car and said “I can’t fucking do this!” and straight left. She also got 130$ that was in my cup holder. Now every time I try to call her my number goes to voicemail and I have no way to get in touch with her. 

Why do the shitting things happen to good people? I mean I know I’m not a good person by any means, and no one is for that matter. But I’ve always been a caretaker of the ones I care about. My mother always told me that if someone was hungry to feed them and always do for other when you are able. Not sure if that really applies to this situation by you get the gist. 

So this morning, well afternoon I wake up and see I have 40$ in my wallet. No gas cigs or food. But of course getting high always comes first. So I call everyone of my connects for roxys and nobody has it. I call everyone for h and nobody has it. Well I had forgotten about one last guy I get 30s from and go to his house. He is also out, but this well know hooker is there. She tells me she has “ice cream” if I want some. I told her I’ve smoked it in the past and snorted and eaten it but I’ve never shot it.(anyone who shoots up knows once you shoot up once you will never do another drug a different way.) So me being desperate and wanting to get high I buy a 20 bag and do half of it. 

Oh My God. I am going a mile a minute. The rush was so fucking intense and I can’t stop moving. I know this is an opiate sub but I thought I would share the crazy story.

Also question for you meff guys out there. Does it help with your opiate withdrawals? The hooker I got it from says that i shouldn’t have withdrawals at all. 

TL;DR nodded out, girl left me, stole my money, I’m high on meth now. Fuck it🤷🏻‍♂️

But what's virtually never included in any of this is potentiation **instructions**. 

The two main ones I'm using are grapefruit juice and agmatine, and so for brevity I suppose this post will just involve these. What I'd like to know is, A., how much one should be taking to induce peak potentiation, and most importantly, B., the dose scheduling AKA the timing of potentiation. WHEN and HOW MANY TIMES do you use the potentiators? Do you take it:

* before dosing (how long before)

* when you dose

* after the dose kicks in

and do you repeatedly take it? 

Alright so it's just this: long story short, what are the exact instructions for exactly how much, when, and how often one is supposed to use the potentiator? I'm tired of having no idea if I'm wasting my potentiators or not or if there's just a way better way I should be doing it. Again, I'm seeking answers for grapefruit juice and agmatine. Unless there's another one that you swear by as being better (that is easily available and not sketchy), then I'd like to hear about that too.

---

No one in my family knows I use dope. My success at keeping the secret is due to what I've termed my ""dope bubble"". I use my dope bubble to keep up the charade. The rules of the dope bubble are: 1. Don't go on benders 2. Don't let anyone into my apartment 3. Only see non-user friends and family if you're well but not high. 4. Don't let your guard down. Be vigilant about what you say and how you say it. This is the story about the day I broke all these rules.

I did my morning shot but it didn't touch my withdrawals. I guess what I saved was the antithesis of a hot spot. Still sick I started texting whoever I could. Then my sickness started to turn into something different, something new. I realize now it was cotton fever but I didn't know it at the time. I'd never had cotton fever before. I crawled to my bed and buried myself under the sheets, this was the end.

My heart was pounding out of my chest so vigorously I didn't realize there was also a pounding on my door. I feebly dragged myself to the front and could hear my moms voice. ""Peter! Peter, open the door!"" I wasn't going to open the door, not like this. I sat beside it waiting for her to go away. ""PETER!"" She started sobbing. I started to think it was an emergency. My mom never visited me unannounced, and she never pounded on my door. Against my better judgment I stood up and turned the lock. The door swung open and I instantly regretted it, my mom fell into my dope bubble.

""Peter you're alive!"", ""Where have you been, you had us all worried"", ""I love you so much"", ""Dave said you haven't been to work"", ""I thought I was going to have to report you missing"". . . I typically visit my parents every week. I didn't visit last week because I was sick. The week before I was starting a new job. I was wearing a t-shirt the last time I saw my family. I had my winter coat out now. How long has it been? I remember reading a text from my mom. I nodded out before I could respond. Did I ever respond? Did I read the last text she sent?

My mom stopped talking and the silence broke my train of thought. I needed to stop shaking. I needed to act normal. She looked me up and down and I knew I couldn't hide it. ""Are you O.K?"". I should have said I was sick with the flu. That would explain why I hadn't answered their messages. That would give me an excuse to make her leave. What came out of my mouth instead was incoherent mumbles and the word ""sick"". Perhaps it was the most honest answer I ever gave her. She grabbed my hand and started leading me to the door, ""I'm taking you to the doctor, you don't look good"". I followed because I wanted to look normal, and that's what a normal person would do if they were this sick, right? It's hard to act normal when you don't know what normal is anymore.

My moms car smelled like my moms car. It was the same car she drove my siblings and I to highschool in. The same car I learned to drive in. I laid down in the backseat. The shaking stopped but I still felt sick and weak. I started thinking about the smell of my moms car, my parents reporting me missing, my mom falling into my dope bubble. I could feel my facade of sobriety collapsing around me, I could hear a ringing in my ears, and I started crying. Not gentle crying but violent, viseral, sobs. The kind of cry where your snot sticks your face to the car seat. My mom reached back and patted my shoulder ""It's ok hunnie"", it made me cry more.

My phone vibrated in my pocket and I remembered the messages I sent earlier. I opened the text, ""30 minutes good?"". This will fix everything. ""Mom I'm feeling better, I forgot I need to go to work"", ""I really think you should see the doctor"", ""I'll go after work, I really need you to take me to work"", ""Peter, it's Sunday"", ""Mom let me out!"", ""You're still in your pajamas"", ""LET ME OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR"", ""I'll drop you off at home"".

I mixed up a shot and pushed it into my crippled veins. The sickness melted away to be replaced by a comforting warmth. Everything was a-ok. I was going to fix everything. I would start by sending my mom an apology text. I had an excuse planned. I had a good story. I turned my phone on and caught up to a backlog of texts.

""I made lasagna, your favorite. Come to dinner tonight""

""How are you?""

""Peter your dad and I are worried. Get back to me""

""Peter I'm coming to visit after work today, really worried about you""

""We need to talk""

There was no way to reconstruct the bubble.

It's been since July of last year, that was my first time. I remember the day and all of it's details. I wish I could go back to that day, where everything was fine and we were happy and not struggling. Since that day everything has gone down hill. We've lost both of our cars, lost our apartment, all of our belongings, just had what we could fit into a couple suitcases. We thankfully came into another car, but not for long. We slept in that car together for months, and him by himself for a month or two as well. We both were lucky enough to go back to our parents, but today my dad took back the plates off the car because of unpaid tickets. Tickets that I had no clue of.

And also how I'm going to get to work... But my main concern is how I'm going to get well. Do I drive the car with out plates?

Yesterday I was putting all my stuff in storage, and messed my back up. The entire reason I originally got into pain management was because of spinal stenosis and bulging discs. I always deal with some pain. But right now it's horrible. It's excruciating.  

I have to do something. I can either spend $60 on a massage and hope it helps. Or spend $50 on 100 mcghr fent patch. It wouldn't make me high, but it'll probably help with the pain .  I only have about 10 minutes to make this decision.  So please give me your thoughts and opinions. 

Edit: well the response is pretty clear. So I'm at the spot right now, she says 6 minutes and she'll be here. I'll update again in an hour or so, to let you know if it's working.

83e50t,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/83e50t/all_walks_of_life/,6,https://redd.it/83e50t,BoftheEnd,All walks of life.,"Sorry for the wall of text in advance. I grew up very privileged. Silver spoon and then some. After secondary school I knew any additional schooling would be 100% paid for by my parents. That alone is a huge luxury in this country. My father wanted me to get a job and work through university though. Learn the value of a dollar, and show a little ambition. Have structure.

That was when I discovered the power of drugs. I was working as a bank teller, hating it. A conversation between a dealer buddy and I started out half joking, and then got serious. It led to me getting blow cheap to sell. I made $500 the first Friday I had anything.

You know that stereotypical anti-drug advertising, where you better not try anything once or it'll hook you in forever? Blow wasn't like that for me at all. Even with a ton of it around I never had the urge to do it. I quit my job and kept selling drugs, telling my dad everything was going well at the bank. Paid for a few of my own things to keep up the lies. 

A girl I was seeing and fell head over heels for was a major party girl. She was like a vacuum cleaner, and she was the one who introduced me to my first oxy. Now THAT first time was a major woah experience. I liked it so much I knew I had to stay away from it. But I liked this girl and she did it often, so I tried to do it maybe once a week. And then it was on weekends. This went on for a few months, when things got worse. I was doing oxy every day, and when my connects all ran dry, I went to a friends junkie uncle to help me out. He was a super nice guy who would charge you a premium, or take a bit of whatever you bought. I didn't mind obviously, it was his connect. 

After 6 months I burnt out. I was doing oxy every god damn day, and not selling nearly enough blow to warrant it. And then oxy wasn't doing anything for me. So I started smoking it. That lasted a while before I craved more. I asked my friends uncle if shooting it was worth it. 

He told me if a drug isn't doing ""enough"" for you, and you want to switch your method on how you do it, it is time to cut back. If a line of blow isn't enough and you want to start smoking crack, turn back. He said it's the same way with oxys/down, anything. 

This whole time in my deluded mind I wasn't a junkie. I just did oxy. It's not like I was on that dreaded H-word. Well two weeks ago was my first time doing actual H. Pure bliss again, a feeling I missed. Last night was my first night shooting it. I convinced my friends uncle to do it or I was going to find someone else who would. I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on. 

When the feeling was over I had never felt so depressed in my entire life. My schooling is a joke, I have told endless lies to my parents for money. Making up all kinds of excuses about school, even faking documents. I feel like the biggest fuck up on earth. I bet none of this makes sense, I felt so depressed yesterday after shooting up for the first time all I wanted to do was drink. And pick up more h. I bet none of this makes sense but I have no one to turn to and I feel like I fucked up my entire life for good. When I think about it for too long all I do is text my buddies uncle asking him to pick up for me. ",1520672860.0

He's like a 50 year old heavy set white guy. I walked up to his door and he let me in to hand it to me inside real quick. After he handed me the bag and I handed him the cash he says, so how often do you do this? I'm 23 but I look like an upper middle class suburban white high schooler so I think most people assume I don't know what I'm talking about when it comes to drugs or that I just started using since most people say they would never be able to guess that I use drugs at all even though I've been smoking H for 5 and a half year now lol. I tell him that I do it everyday but I just recently took a week break to try and get clean and ended up relapsing a few days ago. He says, ""well if you ever want to get off this shit, I've got Fentanyl pills. They're a little expensive but they absolutely fuckin work.""


WTF? Fent pills to get off H? When he said if you ever want to get off this shit I expected him to say hit him up for subs but fent pills? WTF? And why did he say they're pricey? Fent is cheap compared to street H. What do you guys think his reasoning to try and get me to ""get off"" H by starting to take fent pills? I'm not gonna do it obviously, I'm just curious as to his reasoning for saying that. You think he wants to get me to switch to fent and charge me more for it than black even though it's supposed to be cheaper so he can make even more money and he just thinks I don't know what I'm talking about? Or do you think he just really doesn't know what fent is and believes what he says that fent can help get you clean? He kinda does strike me as the type of dude that would believe what people tell him easily and someone might've sold him fent after they got it for cheap and made him believe that it's expensive.


I just think it's fucked up if he does know what fent is that that means he's trying to fuck up who he sees as a kid's life by getting them to switch to fent after telling them that fent can get them clean. The kid wants to get clean but ends up even more fucked than he was before. Why not just say by the way I have fent pills for sale if you want that instead ever because I know some people genuinely would pick fent over dope given the choice.


What's even more strange is that his dope doesn't have any fent in it that I can tell. Obviously I can't be 100% sure just by looking and smoking it but from experience I'm pretty sure it doesn't have any fent in it.

I sent him a text back asking why he is not selling to me, he didn't respond at first so I sent him a couple more. Then he sent one back saying that it's because I'm not his main guy and he only sells to people who always to buy from him because he doesn't want to be someones back-up dealer. I wanted to send him a text back saying that he sounded like a jealous girlfriend but I didn't, maybe I need him in the future, maybe he might be in a better mood and is willing to sell to me then.


My main guy still hadn't texted me back so I opened my container of cottons and decided to do a cottonshot. 

I got cottonfever from the cottonshot and  just stayed in bed for the rest of the evening...

Both of them can go to hell.. But I need them..

-Started smoking heroin at 17.
-Got clean for the first time at 21 in a rehab not by choice (they gave me Darvon for a week and cut me down daily til I didn’t take anymore.)
-Shortly after I started using once in awhile until it became daily again. This time I was in another state and only found 30mg roxi pills which I snorted.
-I used suboxone sometimes w no issues of precip. W/d until I started using heroin again. (I looked for it for months until I found it in a new place but always was very determined)
-After a couple years of heroin again I went to the methadone clinic. And spent two years there until I slowly weened down and got to 30mg. Then I waited a few days using heroin and did the switch over to subs. It was crazy I threw myself into precep. W/d and would take a sub in the morning, within an hour I would freak out and run to the mans house and get dope but for the next few days I would still take subs in the morning. I kept with it and within a couple days I stopped running to the dope man and went to my clinic and got subs from them everyday. Around 14mg is what I started and then eventually got myself down to one 8mg pill over a three week period....(my last few weeks of subs I barely took any)  I would smash up and use a tiny speck (sublingually) and then I jumped off after 9 months of subs.
-This was April 2015. I stayed clean off of EVERYTHING except weed of course but all opiates and I was craving but I was enjoying life then it was my BFs birthday 
-June 21 2015 I fucked around and did dope again. Of course you guys know the story it was easy I could use for a day or a weekend and have a bad Monday or something but get back on track. So when I relocated back to my home state in Dec 2015 I ended up just taking subs and making then four day trip across the country.
-I got back to my home state, started hanging out w old friends and eventually got wrapped up again and started smoking heroin. 
-In sept 2016 I got myself back into the clinic. I tried to jump off in Oct 2016 and went into precip w/d with the subs and ran back to the clinic. 
-I’ve been there the whole time and occasionally smoking dope sometimes w my dose. I got myself back down to 35mg methadone and Monday March 5 was my last day going there.
-I lightly smoked heroin to get by the last few days and this morning was the first day I was to take my subs. Yesterday I used half of the normal amount I had been throughout the week, had a toss and turny night and this morning it has been between 13-14hours since I had smoked last and thought I could take my subs. 
-My eyes were watering, my body was sore, I was yawning, I had stomach upset. I put 8mg under my tongue got in the shower and within an hour I was freakin out, my heart was racing, my legs and arms were achey like 100x more than before and I couldn’t really keep my legs still, my pupils were huge, I was gagging a little and my stomach was roaring and moving like crazy.
-I tried to take 4mg more of subutex under my tongue and it didn’t really help. I ended up getting heroin and smoked it. After 12 years of never using a needle in my addiction, not once I did because I wasn’t getting any relief smoking. I ended up getting a little relief to where I could go to sleep and my arms and legs weren’t as heavy and I could actually hold my head up and get out of the shower, but I have a rockin’ headache, don’t wanna do more dope cause I wanna try the sub again tomorrow but I just want relief too.

My question is, 
who is a longtime heroin user here that has ever put themselves into precip. W/D and then used but took subs the next day as well. 

I can’t go back to the clinic. Yes the money thing is good because it’s $55 a week vs daily but it doesn’t last the 24 hours (I won’t go to a high dose because I sleep all day) and I am unhappy on it.
I had the best success that 9 months on subs and had saved up a bunch of money and was working way harder, doing more hobbies and seeing my family and doing things w my sober friends.

Also my family and friends have no idea I’ve been struggling with this for years.
They knew when I went to rehab 8 years ago and paid for it but didn’t know the entire four years before it that I was using and also would prob be pretty upset if they had found out I had been doing it behind their backs again. I am a functioning addict and keep a job, I pay for my condo, I own a car and take care of four animals. I can’t really just check out and asking my family to send me to rehab again after they think I’ve been clean since 2010 is NOT an option. I have lots of subutex and suboxone. I’ve been saving these up for a couple years now....

I tried to be as safe as possible testing small amounts before eventually snorting the whole baggy. Was pretty nice but given that it felt only about as good as a few perc 10s, I’m pretty sure it was fent analogue and cut with other shit to make it substantially weaker. Bought some more from the guy yesterday so I could enjoy more yesterday and today.

About three weeks ago I was doubting if I could continue on this journey to detox Norco.  Well, I've made it out alive.  I still have some funky gastro issues, but they're very tolerable.  I have some dicyclomine(10mg) that helps out quite a lot with cramping.    Restless leg syndrome and anxiety at night time(usually when I would take my meds) are still something I'm having issues with completely sober.  I've tried both gabapentin and weed; I prefer weed because it helps a few issues all at once.

The cravings are still there.  If this was not my decision, I would have already been right back at it.  I need to move my pill bottles off of the counter.  Brushing my teeth, washing my hands, going to the bathroom, or just passing through all make me glance over onto my countertop.  I feel as though if it was out of mind, out of sight, it wouldn't be an issue at all.  I almost grabbed my Norco bottle when packing, with the mindset of just in case I need it for pain.  There is no just in case.  I just need to deal with it.  I'm done.  But it was almost that easy.

I know my overall outcome is nothing compared to H and fent.  This is probably child's play, but to me it was like moving mountains.  There was a very real moment where if things got worse, I was going to re-attack it when I was more prepared.  I can't even imagine how I would react when faced with that fent withdrawal.  My only advice would be to find something that helps you focus on your goal, no matter how shitty you feel.  If you want it that bad, you'll get it.",1520796963.0

So I have been sniffing dope lately and decided to make my endeavours more efficient at work by getting some of those [acrylic snuffer things](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0794RCL95/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8).

So I ordered these and they arrived and after work I wanted to load it up and make sure it worked properly and wasn't going to spill. So I look over them and open it and twist the knob and everything looks good. I take a few big sniffs with the knob in different configurations to get comfortable with it. Then I load it up with about 100mg of dope and start messing with it. Powder keeps falling out the holes so I continue to sniff on it and test it out, tryin to make it work right. After a few minutes of testing I decide maybe it's just this one that's broken, so I dump the dope from the first one to the second of 4 of these acrylic fuckers. Try to make it not spill etc. Decide these cheap fuckers are exactly that and dump my dope back out onto my mirror.

That's when I see it, a bunch of tiny and a few larger pieces of red and black acrylic plastic mixed in with my dope. Then it hits me, I've got a shitload of tiny plastic shards all up in my nasal passage.  I go to the sink and do a quick nasal water flush. Yesterday morning I woke up with a horrible dry mouth and completely clogged nasan passages. Couldn't taste or smell a thing. My uvula felt like the times my brother would hold me down and tickle me and I would scream but mum and dad weren't home so it didn't help. Raw but still itching terribly. I get light headed and feel like I'm going to pass out every time I stand up. I took some sudafed today and stood in a fully hot shower until the hot water ran out. I got my nasal passages cleaned out a good bit. I can breathe thru my nose again and I'm just trying to keep it that way.

Am I going to die? Can I just wait it out? What's the worst thing you've inhaled without realizing inb4 asbestos? ",1520794251.0

I did a shot in the bathroom (boyfriend doesn’t like seeing me IVing). I always yell out “GOT THE VEIN” and if I’m not out of the bathroom or have opened the door in 30 seconds, he comes in with some Narcan.

Anyways, all was good and I came out to watch a movie with him. My eyes kept shutting, I was nodding and started having mini-dreams, like you’re half asleep and half awake. I closed my eyes for many two minutes and had this “dream”, or at least I thought that I was at the dance club playing monopoly (don’t ask) and a creepy guy was my opponent. He kept hitting on me so I screamed at him I AM ACTUALLY A LESBIAN. Turns out I screamed it outloud, in real life.

My boyfriend thought I was serious and immediately stormed off yelling “So this entire relationship was just a LIE? I’m so so done” and shut the door before I could say anything other than “wait please thats not what-“

I called him and he picked up 10 mins later and told him to come home so I could explain. Still upset, he accepted.

In the end, it was all good, he believed me.

But WTF, has this ever happened to anyone else? Nodding and then saying something completely random? If so, any stories?

man btw it took me 60 mins to write this and spellcheck because I kept closing my eyes and starting to write gibberish. I swear that closing one eye helps

Edit: to the people thinking my boyfriend doesn’t use and has to babysit me constantly - He uses too. He just doesn’t like seeing me shoot up. He snorts and smokes it. I’m there with Narcan for him too. We both love each other. It’s sad, but we have to be there for each other",1520793495.0

Back in 2015 I went to mexico for ibogaine treatment when I was on methadone. The treatment facility I went to was amazing. In a gated community on the beach, always nurses/people on staff to help, you get your own master bedroom, They give you a short acting opiate such as morphine or oxycodone in the days leading up to the treatment, as well as xanax, if needed for sleep. 


The ibogaine trip itself was also an amazing experience, About 1 hour after ingesting the ibogaine I felt relief from all WD's. Then an intense psychedlic trip that I can't compare to anything else, for about 12 hours or so, and then recovery. But after the ibogaine treatment, about 90% of the acute WD was gone, and this was methadone.


The hard part is staying clean, which is why an aftercare plan is very important.


I wish ibogaine was more mainstream and legal, it really can work wonders for WD and getting off of various drugs.


Not to mention, it also seems to 'reset' your tolerance as well, and I am considering doing it again just for this purpose. not to mention just the overall experience the trip, the whole thing was enjoyable, was like a vacation. During treatment I was hooked up to an EKG and a dr had to be on staff the whole time as well as nurses.


I really want to do it again, just for the experience and to maybe try and lower my tolerance to kratom. But its pretty expensive.

The first time I tried to go cold turkey and that did not end pretty. I caved at around 48 hours because I just couldn't take it. So after that I opted for the good ole suboxone taper. And it worked!! I took suboxone for about 8 days slowly tapering off and at around day 15 or 16 I was totally fine. Checkmate, dope, I win.  Right? Nope. At day 17 I had the tiniest little resurgence of withdrawal craving pangs and I immediately called my dealer and caved within 20 minutes. I am the weakest willed person on earth, yeah, I know. One day of dope turned into two, and then three.  But here's the thing: now the drug test is truly upon me as the drug test can be any time next week so I absolutely CANNOT use anything, as I cannot risk not getting this job in any way whatsoever, the shame of facing my family for failing a drug test would be too much to bear and would ruin my relationship with my parents forever. 

But here's the point of my post: The physics of addiction are fucking bullshit. After using dope for a measly 3 days after being clean for 17 I am back to square one in terms of withdrawal. And now I REALLY have to pay the piper, as I MUST NOT use anything under any circumstance. Now I'm in my own little hell of withdrawal that I've designed myself, and cannot escape even though I want to and have the means, with thousands of dollars in the bank and plenty of connects. I am currently 48 hours into WD's and purely miserable. I absolutely cannot take suboxone as I'm terrified it will register on the test due to its extremely long half life.

While true, we pirates think fondly of the Rrrrr, but truly our hearts belong in the C.

Ok this one is a little more simple, but also since I'm making the contest, I naturally have to make it as convoluted as possible. No BTC right now to giveaway, but the fent strips did come in.


I have chosen 3 numbers by sacrificing 3 children to Cthulu'. He expressed great joy by reciting these three numbers.  

Unforutantly for me, this has led me unable to get high. Everytime I doin heroinfentsadeine, I feel more sober.


I am cursed.


So I need your help to break this curse! Each of you can guess 3 numbers. Be warned! The goal isn't to guess the numbers, is to avoid the Mad One's number! For one accidental guess with make you automatically lose, and on top of that, you will be punished.


The punishment for reciting the Number of the Danmed (any of them)....is ~~death~~, you must say a nice, and positive thing about every single person who has posted before you, do this, and you will be spared, and receive the consolation prize of one test kit).

The winner will be the one whose 3 numbers are furthest away on the integer numbering system. (i.e. if the number is 25, 88, 198), a possible winning guess can be 120, 121, 122, if no one has a ""farther guess"", like (123, 124, 125). They're closer to 198, but they moved away 1 more then 88, and are still the farthest


3 guesses per person, you can guess one at a time. You CAN guess the same number as the others, but you CANNOT use the same numbers someone else did. Example:

If BoofyMcBoof uses 4,15,23

and 
AnalMcAdams uses 62, 123, 199

And you:

SourSmegma wants  can use [4, 15, 100] or [62, 123, 15] but not direct copies.


I've screencaptered the numbers so no one can say I changed them ahead of time for lulz (which is something I would totally do).

IF someone mentions one of the demon numbers, that number will be announced, and naturally, you can only guess 2 numbers, then 1.


**TLDR: The point of this one is to be as precisely inaccurate as one can be. You lose by guessing any of the 3 numbers, and they will make you mad. To cure this madness, you must say a positive compliment to every poster above you. Upon doing so, your curse will fade, Cthullu will be lulled, and you will find the hidden Treasure of Consolation, 1 fent test kit.***


There are no second, or runner ups this time. Contest will run till about the time I wake up tomorrow (this time, whatever its now, noon eastern). 5 strips to the winner. (8 strips given away total, planning to order far more next week!).


Eventually, my goal is to have enough money  to just give these fents away to anyone who PMs me, so if you REALLY need a fent test kit and can't afford it, something will be done. (DON'T DO THIS NOW, I R NOT A MONIES YET, I really don't have the means to operating something like that). 


Let this experiment into the insanity begin! (Sorry for those waiting till around 11-midnight tonight, as I said last week, I run on Lana time, and Lana time is NOW). 

I'll check periducaly, but I feel I'm gonna have to lots of maths to figure out who wins, so I'll have to lock it tomorrow morning when I wake up, if I havn't calculated the closest.

Collapsed veins, endocarditis, abscess 
The decorations of your disease 
As if infected with all your mumbled pleas.

Thump thump thump....
you feel your heart about to shatter your rib cage 
Even though you’ve been here since a young age
It didn’t start out like this
But Eventually you became addicted to deaths kiss
Down to the underworld you crawled
To get to this place you did not fall.

Ahhhhhhh....
Relief, if only just momentary
You can tell yourself it isn’t monetary 
Nothing in this life is free
You know you were just on your knees 
Sucking dicks for a fix
Showing your tits for a hit
Shit, this got serious quick
You sold your dignity for a price
There’s just some things you can’t get back in life.

.........
Silence
Your favorite sound
What you would imagine it’s like underground
Minus the maggots chewing your decaying flesh 
A sick mind ticked into thinking it’s their best bet
That is the nature of the beast 
On your hopes and love it will feast 
Until there is nothing left to take
Unless there’s a new victim at your wake.

It was my usual “alarm clock” that awakened me from an uneasy sleep: The early pangs of opiate withdrawal. Restless legs. Vivid dreams during the rare few minutes of REM sleep that actually found me. Hot/cold sweats. Severe anxiety. It’s impossible to truly be comfortable while being dopesick. It was the anxiety that bothered me the most that morning. I had an afternoon shift at the bar where I was employed and I knew there was absolutely no way I could work while being two days into dopesickness. At that point in my addiction, I could fake being well during the first day, but the second day wasn’t so easy. My addiction was obviously a secret from most of the people I worked with and I had to keep it that way. I looked at my wallet and pulled out my last $50, wondering if spending it on drugs and feeling normal for a few hours was worth not eating. I don’t know why I even pretended to myself that I would ever choose food. 

With my mind made up, I picked up my phone and sent the usual text to my usual people. “You know anything?” It was early in the morning, so I didn’t expect to receive a response as quickly as I did, but a response I did receive in less than a minute. 

It was from another addict who’s nickname was “Noble.” According to him, he earned the nickname because of how well he treated the people he dealt with but so far I had had the opposite experience. He was the type of person you could tell had once had a good head resting on his shoulders. Remnants of lost intelligence. Years of hard intravenous drug use had changed that, however. I’d met him in trying to procure suboxone strips, of which he got once a month from a doctor, but his body betrayed his true drug of choice. Crystal methamphetamine. Noble was about my height, around six foot, but easily 30 pounds lighter. His head looked like a bug-eyed skull tacked on to an emaciated corpse. He reminded me of the dead eyed holocaust victims you see in old World War II movies and documentaries. His cold blue eyes were always opened wide and glassy, constantly darting around, looking at his surroundings but not truly seeing what was there. 

“Yeah man, I know where something is. ABG morphine 60s. But they’re $25 apiece...and I need you to buy me one. I’ll get you back with a strip on the first but me and my girl need to get well.”

“Fuck” was all I could think as i repeatedly read his response. I looked back at my last $50, painfully aware that one morphine 60 wouldn’t even make me well with my current habit. I usually ate 180 milligrams of morphine just to catch a nod... 60 milligrams orally would keep me from puking at best. 

“I have $50 but one isn’t enough for me...it wouldn’t even be worth the drive out there” I texted back. 

“Well, if you’d finally do it right, it would keep you well all day.” He responded. By “do it right” he meant break the pill down into a solution with heat and water and inject it intravenously. Shoot it up. Something this guy has hinted I should do before. “Eating them is just such a waste, man. It breaks my junkie heart.” Yes, I was addicted to pain pills. Yes, I ate them every day. Yes, my tolerance was ridiculously out of control. But shooting up was a line I’d always told myself I would never, under no circumstances, ever cross. It was as if not using a needle separated me from the “real” junkies. If I finally shot up, it would somehow make my addiction a serious problem instead of just a bad habit. Of course I was lying to myself and deep down I knew that I was already a junky, but at least I could still say I had never shot up. 

I didn’t respond immediately. I waited half an hour, hoping that someone else would come through. Checking my phone every thirty seconds...mindful of the time slowly running out for me to be able to get that (essentially) $50 pill and be back in time for work. He texted me again, “so what’s up?.” The withdrawals had started to feel worse from the moment I found out I could possibly get that sweet, sweet relief, as they tend to do. I was mentally talking myself into getting the pill... the angel on my shoulder telling me I could go get the pill, eat it, and make it through the upcoming shift...not quite well but not throwing up every time I smelled food cooking either. The devil on the other shoulder sat there quietly...the both of us knowing what he wanted me to do without need of an argument. The both of us already aware that he had already won this silent exchange. I grabbed my keys and texted Noble “OMW.”

As I was driving down the highway, I thought about how my choices had lead to this situation. Me, in my early 20s, decent looking, a smart veteran student breezing through school on my Post 9/11 GI Bill and slowly losing control to a pill addiction that I refused to admit was truly serious. At this point I’d been an addict for two years. My active duty contract had ended in April 2013 and I moved back to my hometown for school. I’d been stationed in California and while I loved it there and truly would have been happy staying, school was much cheaper in my home state. Plus my family, whom I’d neglected my whole enlistment, were all in Mississippi. But I don’t really “fit in” in my home state. I was covered in tattoos that weren’t done in “uncle scooters tool shed”...they were full color and done by a professional with good ink and packed in with a tattoo machine, not shoplifted Indian ink amateurishly packed by a tattoo “gun.” I hated country music and most rap (I love a lot of rap now though, oddly enough). I especially hated the awful mix of the two genres that was becoming increasingly popular around here. My high school sweetheart and I were not married with 3 kids like 70 percent of the kids I graduated with. I didn’t like to drink shitty light beer in a field around a bonfire every other night. Not that there’s anything inherently wrong with any of that (except the scratched tattoos, for sure. Don’t fucking do that), it just wasn’t me. I was bored. I regretted moving back during these few months before classes started. 

My mother, being a severe addict herself, had handed me a handful of hydrocodone on one of those boring nights and I’d fell in love. They made me feel “10 foot tall and bullet proof” in a way that being a Marine never truly made me feel. They “turned all my bad feelings into good feelings.” I didn’t think about how lonely I felt in California while all my high school friends were in college having fun and how they were bored of it by the time I moved back. I didn’t think about how fucked my self-esteem was because of the 5 years of abuse I endured at the hands of my step mother (a story fit for a novel itself). I didn’t think about how hurt I was that my “high school sweet heart” didn’t come running back to me the second I got home like I always came running back to her (figuratively thanks to the distance) throughout my enlistment. Like she and I always planned. None of that shit mattered. It was just me and that amazing, warm euphoria. 

All of that to say...I fucking loved opiates. I was fresh out of the Marines with thousands in my bank account in a state with enough pill prescriptions for each man, woman, and child to have 5 pills a day all year (citation needed). I bought them up at every chance I got. I talked my mom into giving me a substantial amount of hers. I was high for months. I didn’t even realize I was addicted...I had no concept of what that truly meant. Hell, the first time I’d went through withdrawals I never even realized that’s what it was. It never even crossed my mind as a possibility. I spent the next two years in this opiate-induced stupor, nodding my way through college, somehow managing a decent GPA. Further neglecting my family. Not caring about the beautiful pretty young things trying to make a boyfriend out of me, something I pined for while alone in California thinking about my “high school sweetheart” but couldn’t care less about now. I was oblivious to anything that wasn’t related to pain pills. 

Two years. By this time, even though I was in denial about the seriousness of it all, I had been addicted for two years. The people that truly mattered to me... the people I still gave enough of a shit about to make an effort to keep in my life... knew about my addiction and were worried about me. One of these friends in particular had experience with opiate addiction herself and knew that I had a long, tough road ahead of me. But of course, “she didn’t know what she was talking about. I’m different, I’m strong, I can stop whenever I want to.” All or this is what was going through my mind as I drove towards that line I promised myself I would never cross. I guess a part of me honestly believed I was driving to just take a peak at the line, to gaze over the edge into the abyss, but not to actually take the plunge. Ascend to the next level of junkiedom. I remember sitting there, driving along and lying to myself and “Down in a Hole” came up on my playlist. Hearing Layne Staley belt “down in a hole and I don’t know if I can be saved” was too much for me to listen to and I had to turn it off.

The drive took over an hour. Somehow my area of the country had been spared by the opiate epidemic currently ravaging the rest of the country and it wasn’t unusual to drive that far for pills. You’d need to drive even further for heroin...it just wasn’t around. I pulled up to Noble’s house and out he walked with his “baby momma” trailing behind... a half white, half black toddler that was very obviously not Noble’s on her hip. Meth was also very obviously her drug of choice. I had known her in high school, not even a decade ago, but even at that current distance from my car to their front door it was obvious the years had not been kind to her. She had the same wide open, darting, glassy eyes as Noble. Her teeth were yellow and lips chapped and cracking. Sores from meth-fueled picking dotted her face amongst ordinary acne. Tangled, damaged blonde hair. She was skinny, but somehow looked fat at the same time. I was immediately reminded of a character from a show I watched that went as a “sumo wrestler after he lost the weight” for Halloween. Her body wasn’t quite that extreme, but the skin and fat clung loosely to her bones. When she got to my car, she acted as though we hadn’t seen each other in years even though I’d seen her not even a week ago. In her defense, she had been drooling all over herself after taking two Xanax bars that day, so I guess remembering me would be too much to ask. 

There was another person walking toward the car that I didn’t know. He was short...about five foot tall. He wasn’t as emaciated as Noble and his “baby momma” but it was still obvious that he “dabbled” in using amphetamines. He was wearing sandals that showcased his dirty toes and crusty nails, an even more filthy pair of white (I think they should have been white) cargo shorts that had brown blood stains on top of the thigh, and a blue tank top covered in specks of paint. His shoulder had one of those shitty home-made “tattoos” that I mentioned despising, and underneath it was a large pit of a scar. At the time I didn’t realize it, but looking back it was obviously remnants of an abscess from missing a shot. 

“Hey this is [Name withheld because I don’t want to piss these people off in the off chance they actually read anything], he’s straight, I’ve known him awhile. He’s sick too and I told him it was cool to tag along. Is that cool?” Noble did this purposefully. He knew I was sick, knew that at this point I would agree to anything to get to that pill. Knew that I would agree to stuffing my car full of more people than I had seats. “Sure, let’s get going,” I said without revealing my disapproval in my voice.

“Thanks man, I’m sure you know how it is...I appreciate it,” said [REDACTED] as he hopped into my back seat with Baby Momma and Obviously Not Noble’s Toddler. 

We drove along, me trying to ignore the dumb junkie meth head bullshit my party was talking about that I was totally still above. Noble asked me to slowdown at one point, assuring that the pills weren’t going anywhere. I was running out of time and acutely aware of how meth heads like to promise they know how to find exactly what you want, knowing full well they’re lying in order to get a free ride to get to a gram of shard. [REDACTED] had a voice that sounded like a frog was nesting in his throat in place of an Adam’s Apple. Maybe it was the withdrawals, maybe it was the nervousness of knowing The Line was inching ever nearer, but every single thing about these people annoyed the ever-living fuck out of me. Their feint smell of body odor, their shitty choice of music playing through my AUX cable (Limp Bizkit...seriously?). The poor kid crying in the back seat, probably hungry or wet. What had I gotten myself in to? 

15 minutes later, we finally arrived at the location of the pills. A trailer surrounded by red dirt, pine trees, rusted immobile cars, and burn piles full of blackened beer cans. Inside lived a man dying of a liver disease I’ve forgotten the name of and his red headed, meth-eyed adult son. The poor guy could barely walk. He seemed happy to see my passengers, surprising me that anyone could be happy to see such shitty people. Me still oblivious to the fact that I was just like them. Well, almost. I haven’t crossed the line yet. But it is coming. 

I hand Noble the $50 and he goes to the back room with Dying Man. He claims Dying Man doesn’t like to “do business” in front of strangers but it was probably because I was getting ripped off over the price of the pills. They come back to the kitchen, one of those cheap 70s mobile home kitchens with particle board cabinets and a decrepit counter jutting from the wall, establishing the boundary between the kitchen and living room. Noble shows me the pills and asks the rhetorical question: “Are you shooting yours?” The withdrawals are in full swing at this point, whether it’s all in my head or truly that bad I can never really tell right before I know I’m about to get well. I give the expected answer. The angel on my shoulder weeps and flutters away, never to be seen again. 

Noble goes to the kitchen and gets to work fixing the shots as I make my way to the living room couch. I sit and look around the room. There isn’t much...another chair and a box TV accompanied by a cheap DVD player and sporadically placed discs. There’s nothing of real value anywhere in sight. A true drug addict house. Baby Momma makes her way towards the couch and sits entirely too close to me. 

“It’s been a minute, hasn’t it?” She asks me. No, it hasn’t, I think to myself. Not nearly long enough. 

“Yeah it has. I see you have another kid?” I say inquisitively. 

“Oh yeah...this is Stormy Grace. My third...I have another you ain’t seen. I assure you she was a mistake,” she said rather harshly. But I knew what she was getting at... as I said before, the child obviously had a black father. Baby Momma was ashamed. “You know, back in school I woulda never fucked no nigger. But I was at a party one night and her daddy drugged my drink and raped me. I don’t even remember it...I wasn’t sure it even happened until I failed that pregnancy test” she explained in her exceptionally thick southern drawl. I was thankful Stormy wasn’t old enough to hear the insane bullshit currently coming out of her “mother’s” disgusting, cracked and yellow mouth. Her tongue had a white film covering most of it. I suddenly had a sick taste in my mouth. 

“You’re up, [My Last Name],” declared Noble. People always call me by my last name for some reason. “Just stay right there,” he continued as he walked towards the couch with a loaded syringe. Letting someone else make my shot is something I would never do later on in my addiction, but that day was a learning experience. He held out an old leather belt towards me. “Wrap that around your upper arm, strap going away from you.” I did as I was instructed. The belt cinched around my upper arm and my veins began to bulge and pulse as I clenched and unclenched my fist. It almost felt like I was at a routine doctors appointment, about to draw blood for tests. Almost. 

“Damn son, you got some monster veins” proclaimed [REDACTED]. “You could park a fire truck in those fuckers.” 

“This is his first time,” Noble told him as he flicked the syringe, watching the bubble of air float up towards the needle and pushing the plunger up to release the excess air. He squatted down on one knee, moving closer to my outstretched arm. 

[REDACTED] has a look on his face that shows he obviously didn’t know I had virgin veins. “Man, you sure about this?” He asked me in his froggy voice. “This is the next level. After this, eating em just won’t cut it. You think being dopesick is bad now, just wait and see what it’s like after a healthy IV habit.”

“I’ve been addicted for years...I can eat 180 milligrams of morphine at a time...100 milligrams of oxycodone...I mean, I get sick off all the Tylenol before I even get well from eating those pills. This has been a long time coming. If I didn’t go through with this now, it’d be just a matter of time before I did it with someone else anyway.” I was rationalizing this idiotic decision to myself as much as I was to him. 

“Alright man...it’s your life.” said the Frog Man. 

“Here it goes...” Noble found the big ropy vein in the crook of my arm and slid the long needle through the skin. I felt it pop into the vein, saw the quick spurt of blood shoot into the syringe as Noble pulled the plunger back to make sure he’d hit his mark. He pushed the plunger all the way forward quickly, much more quickly than a nurse or doctor would do. “Let the belt go,” he instructed and I abided. 

“Mother fucka you are HIGH” croaked the Frog Man.

But I wasn’t. Not yet. It wasn’t like the movies, where the actor’s eyes roll into the back of his head before the belt is even loose. It took awhile, long enough for me to question if 60 milligrams was enough or if Noble had stolen my pill. But just as those doubts were getting comfortable in my mind, the morphine molecules pushed the doubts away as they attached themselves to the receptors in my brain. I felt it first in my legs. They felt like they had magically become one hundred pounds heavier. Then it moved to my chest...the cheap tile pulling my torso towards the floor like a strong magnet. Next were what my addict friends and I call “pins and needles.” With a good morphine shot, you feel it inside your colon first. Yes, needles in your asshole. And you enjoy it. Then it started in my head and moved down my shoulders and arms. My teeth felt as if they were about to shatter. I had become extremely hot, my face as red as the tattooed flowers on my arm. Most importantly, I was no longer dopesick. No more stomach pain, no more sweating while simultaneously freezing. No more anxiety. Not even any guilt over crossing the line so easily. 

“Daaamn...that was a good un...your face is red as fuck!” exclaimed Baby Momma as she handed me Stormy. “My turn.” Noble took the other loaded rig out from behind his ear, the doctor of this appointment pulling out his pen to write her a prescription for euphoria, and administered the shot. “I hope you don’t think less of me,” she said lazily to me as the hit took effect. I wondered why she thought I’d think less of her after doing something I’d just done myself. Then I realized she was talking about Stormy. I already assumed that the rape story was a lie... that in reality she’d let her drug dealer fuck her raw and cum inside her in exchange for half a gram of meth. I remember thinking how fucked up it was that she was more ashamed of fucking a black dude instead of the years of drug abuse. Good ole Mississippi. And they say racism is dead. She stood up and dropped her needle into the cheap tile floor. The Red Head Meth Head, who I had forgotten was lurking in a corner, stared at Baby Momma’s flabby skinny-fat ass as she bent over to retrieve her rig. “Whoops,” she said as I snapped out of the pleasure dream from the shot and became keenly aware of where I was. A wave of shame crashed over me along with a sudden urge to run to my car and speed away.

“Alright man, it’s time to go,” I announced to no one in particular. “I have to work in about two hours and I still have to drive you guys back and make that hour drive.” 

“Alright, lets go then. [REDACTED], cmon we gotta go. Thanks (Dying Man) for letting us make ourselves at home.” I guess even meth heads practice Southern Hospitality. 

45 minutes later, the meth heads (I keep saying that...they were more like ‘table’ junkies...they’d do whatever was on the table. Meth was just more prevalent in our area) long dropped off at their house, me driving along to work. Layne Staley singing “look at a man who won’t let himself be,” the song no longer bothering me. I’d crossed that line. I had ascended to the next level. I had done what I’d promised myself I’d never do. I was well, however, and I stayed well for about 24 hours. “It wasn’t that bad,” I thought to myself. I didn’t grasp that I’d just took the first step down a path of true pain, true heartache, true loneliness. I had jumped into that abyss head first. 

“Down in a hole...losing my soul,” Layne and Jerry harmonizing the anthem of my addiction.

I've been coming to this sub and reading all of your stories for about a year now.  I've done opiates a few times, but I'm one of the rare people with a fucked up brain that has some kind of issue with the receptors that opiates bond to, and so I get absolutely zero effect (positive or negative) from opiate use.  That being said, I've been continually fascinated with the whole opiate scene and culture that seems to have sprung up around it.

For example, I LOVE seeing all the different stamps that people post here.  It tickles the same interest area that graffiti does for me - it's a unique symbol that usually only has meaning to people on the inside.  I'm also fascinated with the regional differences, like how the West Coast has black tar but the East Coast is more powder.  Why is that?

It's things like this that I want to learn more about.  Does anyone here know of any websites, books, blogs, etc where I can find more information on this?  All I've seen lately is the overload of news about the epidemic and how it's destroying everything and while that is definitely a major thing, I feel like there's a whole other side of the story that isn't getting told.

If I can find enough information, I'm considering writing a social history of opiate use in the US, because there's more to this whole thing than a bunch of junkies looking to score their next hit.  Maybe if more people understood what your community is BEYOND an addiction, there could be some actual progress made on how to help those that need it.",1520919665.0

I have some opinions from my own experiences but I'd like to hear some of yours as well. Here's the prompt:

There is a widespread belief that substance abuse treatment is often ineffective. Are there effective treatments for substance abuse? How is effectiveness defined? What factors influence the effectiveness of treatment? If this widespread belief that treatments are generally ineffective is true, then is it appropriate for society to emphasize the “punishment” of those who abuse drugs over treatment/prevention? Discuss the issues involved.

What do you guys think? If you have an opinion on any of the above questions, I'd love to hear it!",1520911970.0

I exclusively snort dope (don’t IV or smoke), but snorting makes it so difficult for me to breath, that I’ve decided NOT to buy it anymore moving forward. I am an asthmatic, so I have sensitive lungs as is... but when I snort dope, it makes it so difficult for me to breath that it is honestly not even worth it for me. I’d honestly rather ride out some mild WDs until I’m able to score some oxys.

My question: does anyone else get such bad breathing from snorting dope that they’ll forgo it? Now that I’ve put it in writing I’m almost positive that no one will agree with me lol. Any recommendations? The dope I get is ECP, and doesn’t seem to be cut with fent, as it’s not all that strong (another reason why it’s not so difficult to go without it, even in desperate times). I’ve seen posts here on best methods for snorting that reduce the lung issues I’m describing, but any additional info y’all could share would be greatly appreciated, even if it’s tips/tricks on how best to SMOKE ECP.

One of my backup dealers tried to kill me today.,"Ok, soo let me start this with a lil background.   All of my dealers, Ive known and dealt with for years now. They all are either plugs or dealers. None of them do dope. Some of them drink, some smoke weed, an some do both. But thats about it. Now the dude that I saw today, I havent known him for years. Been dealing with him for a little over a year now. The real operation belongs to my boy in the DR. He got deported cuz he got popped selling dope too many times. And now his ass can't come back to the states. Which sucks cause he was awesome. So now he always has a cousin or friend of his run shit up here. And that's who I saw today. 

So I go through lil phases. Like whoever has the best shit is who I only see for a lil while. Until their shit turns to crap. Now this dude i saw literally for almost all of 2017. But right around xmas time, he fell off bad (long story) , and I started seeing someone who had better shit. 

Well ever since then, he hits me up a few times a week with samples. Since he's been trying to find something like he used to have. But their always garbage like 1 out of 20 times its straight fire. Well today he hit me up with a sample. 

So I grab it and it was light tan powder. And LITERALLY the second I open the bag, I smell a very familliar smell. It smelled like strong ass garlic. Now im italian, and put garlic on everything, so I know it very well. At first I thought it smelt like seasoning because I know some dealers either ship their shit in it, or store it there. But it wasn't just the bag that smelt like it, so did the powder. So I taste some of it dry and mixed with water to make sure I wasnt losing it. And sure enough, I had like garlic breath linger afterwards. My fucking finger even smelt like it from touching it. This mother fucker cut this shit with fucking GARLIC FUCKING POWDER!!! I was beyond livid. And I was sick as a mofo but I was so sketched I just threw it all out. Then blocked his number. 

I 100% wouldve died if I injected that shit. And he knows I fucking shoot it. And we've been on good terms so its not like I did anything to him to warrent him trying to kill me. I don't think he did it on purpose (meaning he was trying to take me out). But hes a dumb ass mother fucker. One of those who just cuts it with w.e powder he can find. And im always super careful whenever I get anything from anyone. But I've never had anything close like this happen to me before. 

So yea moral of the story is... Besides doing testers. Always smell and taste your shit before hand. Incase you stumble upon a fucking idiot dealer that doesnt know his ass from his elbow. And just cuts his shit with any powder that he can match it up with the best. Ugh. ",1520909841.0

I glance in and sure enough they look familiar. I look around, then stuff them into my pocket and walk briskly towards my apartment. I got hella paranoid thinking someone was following me, so I speed-walked right into my apartment, couldn’t have punched the number code faster!

25 5mg Roxicet oxycodone/APAP tablets! I just popped 6, (30 mg), not very much but I haven’t taken oxycodone in literally years! I may have to take more actually, but I am gonna take it slow because they could be fent bombs I guess.

Anyways just wanted to share my good fortune. May JJ bless you all as well!

Edit: I can’t tell for sure if these are real or not. I feel something, but not necessarily what i would expect for 50 mg of oxy. I am only slightly itchy and I did redose 20 mg more about 20 minutes ago so maybe it is coming soon.

Actually I am feelin higher since I started this edit so maybe it is legit, went and got some soda. I think just maybe my tolerance is higher than I thought. 30 mg of roxi snorted used to do me quite well.

This goes beyond just kissing ass to have a good rapport. I mean, even after we pick up, these people would continue conversations with the dealers for like 10 minutes more than we needed (all while in hot areas), or offered (and then did) babysit their kid for free, etc. Just weird stuff you normally wouldn't do with just a random person.

I've heard that people addicted to shopping have a weird relationship with the sales associates.  They have a feeling that they need to impress them or something. I wonder if there is something similar to drug addicts with drug dealers?

It was actually his mom's script day. Whereas Cliff's script only costs $1, his mom's script costs just under $40. 


So first he comes barking up my tree and on that week I didn't have money to spare to pay for his cab and copay. However, Tim likes oxy's and he was always willing to drive Cliff to the doctor and to the pharmacy for some oxy's. 

&nbsp;


On that particular script day, it was actually Cliff's mom's script day but it's important to Cliff because he shares some of his script with is mom and she shares some of her script with him. He wouldn't need to share his script with him mom if she didn't share with him but many of you already know he has worked a scheme which ensures that he comes out ahead.


&nbsp;

The other day I was talking to Tim about how Cliff goes over budget any time you agree to help him buy food whether in person or ordering a delivery.


In Tim's case, Cliff really needed a ride to the doctor that day because his mom is has arthritic knees and unlike Cliff there is absolutely no way she's walking to the doctor. So Tim came right to Cliff's door, picked up him and his mom and drove to the doctor. After that he took them to McDonalds to buy breakfast in order to earn a couple more pills, maybe a little more than two. Then after dropping Cliff's mom off at home he drove Cliff to the nearest pharmacy. The pills were not in stock so they had to go to a second place across town in the end so it's a good thing that he had Tim for the ride.

&nbsp;

In the past Cliff's brother remaarked at how he hates going into a store with Cliff. He awlays adds shit to the check-out counter, ""I'll pay you back later."" It's just mad annoying and moochy even if i'ts not too expensive and you're willing.


&nbsp;

I was telling Tim how Cliff somehow spends $40 on breakfast partly because he gets food for him and his mom for later in the day.

&nbsp;

Regarding his experience at the McDonalds drivethrew, Tim described the situation to me like so just the other day:

&nbsp;

Tim said,

""He asked me to order hm and his mother McDonald's for breakfast""
""Who spends $45 on food for 2 people?""
""He said it would cost $25-$30 the most""
""but he kept adding food to the order""
""pancakes, big macs""

Then I said, that I bet he said ""oh that's fod lunch later today.""


Tim acknowledged, ""yeah, exactly what he said""


""He got a big ass breakfast and and then added lunch like that's for later and I'm like omg.""


&nbsp;

Tim concluded, 

""who eats a burger 5 hours old from anywhere?""

In the past Cliff would often pay me back in pills when I bought him dope. 


Specifically, I want a ratio, like a currency exchange for conversion from 15mg oxy to bundled ECP. A bundle in this case is divided into ten individual bags.


**Let's say someone buys two buns of dope for someone. How many 15mg oxy's would to take to pay the lender back?**


In my experiences with Cliff, I believe I've gotten 10 pills per bun but he might've dropped it to 8 bags. Suddenly I don't remember. I always got the pills a week after buying the dope so and sometimes I miss the details of any given scheme.


&nbsp;

There have been times where Cliff got his script before my pay day. So he'd give me some extra oxys to bridge the gap and it was never a 1 to 1 ratio. 


He'd give me 2 oxy's for every three bags of H and since he was trying to hold on to his script, the pre pay day, post script day trades were  always kept small. 



**3 bags of ECP/heroin for 2 oxys (15mge each).** That was the typical small trade. So if I'm luckly I could've gotten 7-8 bags per a bun if Cliff was being generous. I'm certainly not gonna ask him tonight what the conversion is because I'm not interested in doing business with him anymore anyway.

apparently some nosy meddling busybody cunt customer made some complaint that somehow involved weed (the  shift runner was kinda vague, I wouldn't be surprised if it was bullshit anyway and the boss is just looking for excuses to fire people) so all the staff on shift got their bags searched.

At first I refused on principle because fuck them, what right do they have to go through my personal shit? but they said if I did that they would call the police to do the search and suspend me so I was like, sure whatever, there's nothing in there so go nuts.

Only thing is they found a ropey, knackered old syringe (I have had just this one bag for like 10 years and it has been used for everything in that time)with a bent needle on it and a dirty old metal cup thing that you use to cook up a shot in, so now I'm suspended pending a disciplinary because apparently having old bits of paraphernalia in the bottom of an old bag in a locker in the staff room of a KFC is a serious health and safety risk/violation because we work with food.

I'm already being fucked financially because of the hours I lost when the company fucked up and had to close all its UK stores a few weeks ago (it was a whole thing, in the news and everything) which has set off a spiral of bank charges and overdraft fees and other extortionate shit that was going to take months to pull out of even working the full 45 hours a week, but with this bullshit on top of the two fucking jerkoffs who work tuesday and wednesday 8am to midnight every week deciding to take a bunch of shifts off of me and the Romanian guy I work with (the sneaky little piece of shit manager gave them our Friday shifts this past week and didn't even tell us, he just crossed it out and wrote them in on the rota and I only found out because I went to take a photo of the rota for someone else who works there) 
AND I'm still not fully recovered from the week and a half I booked off at the end of January/start of Feb which I was told I had 5 valid holiuday days to use on only to find out come payday that I only had 1 because the conniving little shitbird boss has been putting people's holiday pay days in with their regular paycheck every week without telling anyone so when it came time to take holiday I didn't get paid for it

this specific KFC is absolutely the worst run business I have ever seen, both in terms as its efficacy as a smoothly run capitalist entity and as an egregious violator of employee rights but they have me over a fuckjing barrel n account of no one else hiring and i have severely hamstrung myself by never learning to drive meaning I am limited to jobs within walking distance or on a bus route during buss operating hours

The stuff was alright, I have a retarded tolerance cause of the methadone, used that for 2 days, then a dose on the 3rd and 4th day to hold me over. Last night I was restless as fuck, feeling sick. Decided to go to dude I did last time, that's when bullshit hit as usual. The dope game there is always shit like this, and we had been driving and waiting around for 3 hours. He ended up contacting someone else in his apartment. I had 55 to my name I gave him 5 and 50 to cop, the other guy got the cash and found some one. Came back with 3 bags and said I only gave him 30.. of course. He pulled out some cash and there was 10 from the 50 I gave him and said it was his, which it wasn't, 5 of it was an old bill I decided to spend cause I collected them. Ended up walking away. The dope was fire as fuck though, for sure had fent in it. Which is what I need to get high. Anyways went to the clinic this morning cause I barrowed the cash from family members right when I get to town.. looks lovely of me doesn't it.. Anyways get there and they said they can't dose me until I contact my old clinic and get a doctor to send something over because it's been too many days without medicating.. Which is just bullshit.

1. Should I take the 120mg now? I' not not sure I'll feel it much, if at all. I have already taken about 1.25mg ativan and 6mg promethazine as ""potentiators"", but really I'm hoping the just extend the buzz I've already got for a little.
2. Should I save it and take a larger than normal dose and finish off with a bang (and hopefully none of the ol' reverse-peristalses.

3. Should I use them to taper, even though I've got plenty of subs to help with that. This option seems like the least likely. I honest believe I'll either eat them tomorrow or end up scoring more to balance it out haha.

After the first 24 hours off it I got really sick I think I had a flu coming on so I slept away a day and thought may as well try and kick the oxy. So I went another day without it then got really sick extremely high fevers. I had a 18 hour fever dream that My cat and I had invented a new product and It was gonna be the biggest thing ever. I felt so hopeful and was really disappointed when I snapped out of it. 

I feel perfectly fine now after 5 days with only some weird feelings. I feel really nostalgic and emotional. I used to be able to ""feel"" every year of my life with a smell, a taste or a feeling not sure how to describe it. The years I was on oxy I don't have those feelings for those years. 

Being off oxy is going to get really expensive when I was using I really didn't care about much consumer goods or fancy things or even trips where I couldn't bring large amounts of pills. I can for see spending 100s of thousands of dollars in the next months on things. I don't even feel a craving for them what so ever.

On a nice little vibe this morning; got a halfway decent headspace although unfortunately some physical discomfort is causing me anxiety. Had to inject in my DVT ridden veins in my wrists yet again - shit blew up like a fucking balloon. Ran a towel under some warm water and winged it out, now it's wrapped around my right forearm and wrist, which should hopefully ease the veins back to normal, or whatever passes for normal these days at least.

Going to phone the Dr and book an emergency appointment. I think I should get my Xarelto dose raised - my blood thinners - to combat this. The situation definitely hasn't been helped by the fact that, due to needle exchange issues, I've been using the same needle that's barbed from overuse for like 9 days straight. Shit looks like a motherfucking zig zaggy torture device at this point...but, alas, enough of my rambling.

As I said before I went off on that tangent, I'm feeling pretty good right now for once. Even though it's a Monday morning I have a busy enough day planned out, which first and foremost includes going to 4 different needle exchanges. So what about you guys? Stupidly I popped 50mg DPH about 75 minutes ago and, considering that I have not yet slept and it's 07:51, was in retrospect probably not the best decision. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.

But still I'm motivated. So I wanna know what all the homies out there are doing today. Anything special planned? Motivated? Dope sick? High on dope? What's your drug of choice today?

Also any advice on dealing with the DVT I mentioned earlier would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time out of your day so far to read my dumb little shit post lol. I'd love anyone who's up for a chat to shoot a PM my way.

Happy nodding, nuff love to ya all :)

I'm looking for user experiences & different ROA, such as volumetric dosing with water, & either making a nasal spray or attempt IV (only with absolutely small & accurately dosed amounts) but I'm aware that's Russian roulette 😵 🔫 

Thinking ill be sticking with vaping powder or BF water off foil incrementally or using my RDA, with the h2o solution or would a propylene glycol + BF mix work better on the RDA coils & cotton? I assume so..  Would the vapors + steam from H2O solution work as well as pure powder vapors?

•Legalization could add average citizens to the poverty statistic.

84amyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/84amyo/could_this_be_withdrawal/,14,https://redd.it/84amyo,poetryisgood,Could this be withdrawal?,"So. I tried opiates for the first time around six months ago. It started with codeine, which I went on binges for 1-3 days once or twice each month. I did the same with morphine one time, just a couple day binge and haven't done that since. Overral I've done codeine around 14-15 times. Sometime in February, I realised that I had developed a psychological addiction. 

I wasn't withdrawing physically, however, gotta say, the ridiculously intense craving driven panic attacks really were--are--something.

Due to this, I decided I would turn to heroin because, in all fairness, I find that stuff tremendously easier to get and also much kinder on my wallet in terms of price and unit ratio.

From the 6th of March to the 7th, I smoked most of what was a gram of heroin. I likely wasted a lot. What happened between then and now is, admittedly, quite hazy for me and I honestly can't remember how many days I tried to smoke on to see if there was still some heroin I could get, but what I do know is that on either the 10th or 11th, I definitely smoked some heroin and, even if in small quantities, I feel that unless it was placebo, it was enough to give me a slight recreational and also obvious pain relieving effect (in this instance of use, my main motive was actually to alieve my chronic pain).

So around 12 hours after that last use, I was eating when I suddenly noticed that I felt quite nauseous. Gradually, my symptoms started building up and I had goosebumps and raised hairs all over, hot and cold flashes and, possibly most alarming to me of all, major dizziness. Was just real weak, lightheaded. All of these symptoms brought on a lot of emotional distress, and in the end I would say that it's possible some of them were psychosomatically accentuated because I may have ended up with a panic attack.

Flash forward to the next morning, I woke up with a moderately sore headache, only on my left side, (mind you, it is worth noting that the day before this I also woke up with a pain on my left temple, but it could only be felt when pressed), which gradually progressed into the most horrible damn thing. This was especially strange to me because, personally, I barely ever get headaches. I took acetaminophen, that didn't work at all, I ate, I drank water, and yet the headache only went away by it's own hours later, only after the same damn symtoms I had the night before came about. I checked my heart rate a few times during all this and usually it was normal, but at one point it went up to a 108 although, I don't think that exceeds the normal range by too much.

Because I worried I may have a concussion or something of that sort, I went to the doctor today and alas, I don't have a concussion. He did, however, mention that my headache was likely joint pain, which made me think, man, could I really be in withdrawal?

Few hours after that the same freakin thing happened as earlier, it was probably the worst this time and although I had no fever, I was burning up like mad, and soon the drug cravings were too and literally everything was crumbling. Inside of me, anyway. Just goddamn debilating honestly, had to go out and seek out another connect to buy from because I just couldn't darn take it.

It probably matters so I'll mention it, my pupils aren't (or at least don't seem to be to me) dilated, I did have a fuck ton of diarrhoea in the past few days, and I've been sweating a load at night but I'm not sure if it can be attributed to this.

I used to use psychedelics fairly regularly when I was younger, and I've always found that with me they tend to have healthy effects, mentally/emotionally, due to the fact they both make me introspective and seem to get rid of my stubbornness/defense mechanisms.

Long story short, I havent used any psychedelics at all since I first started using heroin 9 years ago (which pretty much ruined my life), largely because I was afraid of dealing with my baggage- I'm finally going to bite the bullet and take some LSD tomorrow, trying to focus on taking inventory of my life etc... Tomorrow not tonight because of course I picked a bag up for one last hurrah (I've barely been using at all past year due to living situation), as a junkie is prone to doing.

It's been a hot minute and there are tons of new people here so I figured I'd start with a couple of old ones... so i'm sorry if you've read these before. I'll have some fresh stories here before long.

So there I was, sitting in the Marsh parking lot, waiting on dude to roll through with the gram I had ordered.  While I was sitting there fucking around on my phone a white Malibu rolled up and parked a few spaces away from me.  I glanced over but didn’t think anything of it.  After a couple of minutes I roll down my window to smoke a cigarette and I make eye contact with the dude in the driver seat.  After a few seconds of confused looks, recognition dawned on both of our faces at the same time.  It was Danny.  He was a year ahead of me in high school – star running back of the football team, and one of only a handful of black kids in a rural Midwestern town.  Well half black, anyway.  We didn’t exactly run with the same crowd back then, but we partied together every once in a while through mutual acquaintances.  He was actually the first person I ever bought an oxy from, but that’s a different story.  

He starts shaking his head, laughing to himself while he whips his car around and pulls up right next to me.

“The fuck are you doing here?” he asked, a knowing grin on his face.

“Uhh, the fuck are you doing here?” I asked back, an equally sheepish grin on my face.

“No fucking way. What the odds we run into each other up here in the city at the same time, same place and everything? I mean we an hour away from home. Who you here for, you seeing MC?”

“Yup. Grabbing a g. Damn dude, how long have you been going to MC?”

“Damn near a year now. Hold up lemme hop in right quick,” he said while jumping out of his Malibu, clicking it locked as he jogged over to my passenger side and hopped in.

“It’s been a minute man, how you been?” he said as we shook up.

“Good dude, still doing this shit obviously, but I’m back in school now, so we’ll see how that goes.”

“Oh word? That’s cool man. You remember Michelle? Yeah well she’s pregnant now, I’m gonna have a little girl here in about 3 months,” he said, nervously twisting his hat around his head.

“Damn that’s cra-“ 

“Hold up, he’s calling me.  Hello? Yup, yup. A ball. Yeah.”

“Tell him I’m with you,” I whispered.

“Oh hey, yeah I’m with Freddy. Freddy. Uhh, green explorer. Yup that’s him. He tryin for a g. alright.”

Danny hung up, glancing toward the entrance of the parking lot. “He should be pulling up any second now,” he said while taking a wad of cash out from his wallet.

“There he is,” I said, pointing toward a brand new escalade, bumping their system loud as fuck being conspicuous as shit.  “Here, can you just grab mine for me too?” I said, offering him my cash.

“Alright for sure,” Danny said, hopping out of the car.  He exchanged a few words with the driver then jumped back in.  “Here’s you,” he said, handing me a large single rock of speckled dope. 

“Damn dude, did he get new shit?  This looks different,” I said, holding the bag up for inspection. 

“Yeah man, have you not had it? It’s straight fire, it’s at least… like, twice as good.  Go easy on it if you’ve not done this batch yet, for real.”

“What are you trying to do right now, are you about to get right?” I said while glancing around the parking lot, checking for cops or security.

“Yeah I was gonna run in and grab a bag of points from the pharmacy right quick. You doing yours too? Actually just pull up front and drop me off out front so I can grab those, I’ll throw you a new one and we can do our thing in the parking lot.”

“For sure,” I said.

About ten minutes later he comes walking back out with a small bag and a bottle of water.  I was a little surprised, most grocery store pharmacies I’ve tried won’t sell me needles, so I took a mental note.

We got to work cooking up our shots, glancing around every few seconds to make sure nobody could see us.  I’m sure if anybody had been paying attention, the fact that we were looking around so much was in and of itself more obviously sketchy than anything we were doing.  Fuck it though, the last thing I need is to get walked up on while I have everything out in my lap.  By the time I got everything drawn up and was ready to go, Danny had already registered and was pushing in.

“Fuck you,” I said, gingerly prodding my wrists.  “Sometimes it takes me half an hour to find a fucking vein.”

“Haha, come on now bro, get with it you gotta step up your game.  This ain’t JV no more this here varsity level, you can’t be sitting there taking forever and shit,” he said, scratching at his neck.  

“Still talking just as much shit as always I see,” I said, sliding the needle into my hand.  To my gleeful surprise I registered on my first attempt.  “Thank Christ for new rigs,"" I said, pushing down the plunger on my normal dose of around .2 grams.  

“You got that one right,” Danny chuckled to himself.  After a few seconds of silence, he looked over at me and asked what I thought about it.  I remember trying to mumble an answer, before shutting my eyes for what only felt like a few seconds.

The next time I open my eyes I’m in the passenger seat of a car that isn’t mine, driving down a two lane highway – and somebody is yelling my name over and over again.  

“What the fuck?” I managed to say, sitting up and finally taking stock of my environment. 

“Dude, what the fuck. You fell out on me bro.  You’ve been out this whole fucking time.  We’re over halfway back home.  I didn’t know what the fuck to do man, you were still breathing ok so I just dragged you over to my car and got the fuck out of there.  People were already on their phones and shit man, I couldn’t leave you there,” Danny said with a notable frantic edge to his voice.  

“What the fuck?” is still the only thing I can manage to say.  

“Are you alright man? What’s your name? Who am I? What year is it?” he said, snapping his fingers in front of my eyes a couple of times before taking back hold of the steering wheel.

“Jesus Christ. I fell out? What time is it? How is it already fucking nighttime?” I weakly yelled as it finally dawned on me that hours must have passed.  It was only four in the afternoon when I pulled up to Marsh.

“Yeah dude. It’s almost 9:30. I didn’t know what to do man so I just drove to St. Vincent’s and sat in the parking lot, praying that you were gonna wake up.  I kept checking your pulse and your breathing – you seemed to be alright you just wouldn’t wake the fuck up.  I figured if something went bad it would be best to be close by to a hospital… but I wasn’t gonna take you in if you didn’t really need it. I mean I would have, don’t get me wrong. But this way neither one of us gets in trouble. “

“Holy shit, dude I am so fucking sorry.  I don’t know what the fuck happened.  Shit… shit dude, my bad yo… this sucks – the first time we even see each other in years and I fall the fuck out on you.  How long were we at the hospital?”

“Pshh... I mean, we just left there like maybe thirty minutes ago. We was there most of the night dawg, from like 4:00 until just half an hour ago.  I noticed you starting to wake up a little so I dipped outta there.  I figured you can just crash at my place and I’ll take you back to your car tomorrow when I go reup,” he said, finally seeming to calm down a little bit.

“Fuck, thanks man… I really appreciate you looking out for me like that. Not everybody would do that for someone, for real,” I said while digging out a cigarette. 

“Of course bro, I got you.  But for real though, this is a fucked up way to start a friendship dawg.”

No tolerance with no withdrawals PLUS not having to be sober all the time is a beautiful thing.

But DAMN, the opi-rage is fucking intense!  Ten minutes ago, I was on top of the fucking world, nodding, really feeling good.  I can’t find my remote and all of a sudden, every single little thing I notice that’s not perfect is RUINING my day!  I’m watching a let’s play on YouTube of a game I know, and while I usually love this guy and watching him fuck up and get confused it great, but right now every little wrong turn has me practically shouting “What the fuck is wrong with you, it’s right fucking there!” at my screen.

I’m not new to opi-rage: I was an addict for 2 years and a heavy user for almost 10 years before that,  but this is on a whole new fucking level.  Every mistake is a transgression against fucking mankind and every typo I make wants me to send my phone across the room.

I’m autistic as well, and it always seems like when I get bad opi-rage, the itching gets 100x worse.  I’ve always loved the itchiness when I’m feeling good, but being itchy while I’m raging (because of the whole sensory thing) makes me want to live up to all of the stereotypes and go into full-blown screeching mode (which never happens, stereotypes fucking blow).  This shit feels almost as bad as feeling sober does.

Does anybody know of a way to stop this shit so that it doesn’t ruin my whole fucking evening?  I don’t know if it’s this intense for everyone or if it’s just one more thing to add on to the laundry list of things having autism shits all over.  And don’t tell me to just not use opiates.  We all know the answer to that one.  When this shit doesn’t happen, opiates make me feel almost like a normal person.  Like, I can talk to people, it’s fucking great.

I have a couple of people in my life who are struggling with heroin addiction, and while I want to be there for them, I don't know that I know how. I've never done heroin, and while I have experience with opiates and experience with addiction, I know that I am severely lacking when it comes to truly understanding what it is like. They want to get clean, but that want is not necessarily enough. They live a couple of states away from me, and while I am always there to talk and listen and try to give advice, I know there is not a lot I can do. 

I guess what I'm getting at, is what is some actual valuable advice I can give these people? I can't just tell them to stop using, it's not that simple, and I understand that. I tell them that I love them and that I am there for them, but trying to walk that line between feeling like an enabler and having them shut me out entirely is really difficult.

The only opioid that can bitchslap bupe from the receptors is fent, so I proceeded to eat another 100ug patch (17 mg of fent total) which took care of that shit for a few hours.

I proceed to take 4mg, start getting the precips bad...and thankfully have a fistful of benzos to keep me semi-sane.

I am frickin *retarded* apparently, had a very rough morning:

I had done my last dose of h (smoking) around 1030 AM yesterday. It was only a couple puffs, I had had my usual morning dose (prob .1 - .15) that morning around 9 AM. So it had been almost 24 hours when I took 4 mg of Suboxone at 8 AM. Before I took it, I made sure that i was in wd's - I was def flu-like - but not super uncomfortable. I had wanted to sleep through the worst of it, so I had taken Seroquel ~ 7 PM and slept all the way through, and actually wasn't quite sure how sick I was. 

Well I guess I should have waited longer, since I'm pretty sure I put myself into PWD's. I got WAY worse, instead of any better, and somehow in my agony thought to hit up one of my dealers. Then I fell asleep for about an hour, and woke up actually feeling actually ok, somewhat normal?? Yet, I still went and picked up a dub. I'm at a loss as to why, but I did it and can't take it back now. Yes, I know the the sub is supposed to block any opiates. Out of impulse I guess I just did it anyway, and I think i actually did get a bit high. But I was already feeling OK!! 

Sooo NOW... since I was a dumbass, am I going to be going through it allll over again tomorrow morning? I will def wait till I'm in deeper WD's to take the sub this time. I was so sick I could barely type or read this morning, but I just read that since I had used after taking the sub, I could very well have to go through the whole process again...fml. I'm surprised I found a way to sabotage my own withdrawl...sigh.

I was waiting for the plug and there's a car in the same area as me. I usually play a little game of ""spot the junky"" to make the ""five minutes, papi"" 25 minute wait easier to deal with. Pegged the car as another person waiting. Just then, a young girl, maybe 16 hops out with who I assume is her brother. We had some time to waste, so we drove around the lot and I see an old couple in the front seat. Just your stereotypical grandma and grandpa. Well, I pinned them correctly and the young girl hops out, picks up, and then runs back to the car.

I can't even imagine picking up with any member of my family, let alone my poor, innocent grandparents. Part of me wants to believe she lied to them and said she needed to grab something from a friend, but this epidemic is so bad I am more convinced they know.

My father was addicted to opiates when I was born and long before, my childhood was hell for my mother as a result (he would disappear, cheated on her, etc. Totaled her car a week after I was born then tried to make her take the fall) and the recovery process was hard. He went on methadone, got hooked, and used alcohol to cope when he started tapering a couple years back. Almost died two months back because he blacked out drinking and driving and totaled his truck. Its been horrible, and hard to watch. But anyways. I've got family working/previously working for the state surrounding the opiate epidemic in my state as the death rate is quite high. I may be able to speak out against some of the actions being taken by the state with the clinics that are making treatment a grueling process, and while I have done extensive research surrounding the subject (namely effects it has on the brain) I am beginning to realize how few really have any knowledge of it, and are so dehumanizing. Its frustrating, and kind of upsetting to read just from my standpoint, and i'm sorry to anyone directly affected. People suck. With that said, I want to build a way to educate people. I've found it hard to find resources that are organized to surround every aspect, most are statistic-based or strongly biased, and I want to provide that and, maybe, an outreach like this one where people effected can talk or get help if they choose to. My question was; is there a way for this to be done where people effected wouldn't feel pushed out or over analyzed? I want it to feel ""safe"" but also provide education for people related to, married to or friends with addicts; or even trying to better the local systems. My apologies if this is in any way offensive, I don't mean for it to be, I just want advice on how to do this without doing more harm than good. ",1520967595.0

He had cheeks pressed with sallow flesh. and his hairline was not receding but ravaged by radiation. Although he appears to aged more than his thirty years, there's are still signs in his face of a younger, less cynical Lenar Hoyt. It has become abundantly clear to a friend of mine that he appeared to be extremely ill.


&nbsp;

What kind of illness could affect a man living in this day and age, seven-hundred years after the death of Old Earth, with all the medical technology and resources of the Hegemony and the Worldweb which spans over two-hundred worlds. Medical help from the best hospitals and institutions is often just a few footsteps away by Farcaster no mater how many light years away.


&nbsp;


Well, conventional medicine has helped Hoyt. As he explained to me in his room on the tree ship Ygrdrassil, ever since he left Hyperion he has been in great pain. Alcohol stopped working log ago, just about nothing works except for pure IV ultramorph. When I went to speak to him he was on his knees, med kit strewn across the floor with the faulty ultramorphine injector in his hand. His undershirt was ripped down the middle, soaked in sweat with the pulsing Cruciform on his chest.


I grabbed a new ultra-morphine ampule and placed it in the injector. As Hoyt anticipated, I told him I won't give him the injection until he tells me what really happened on Hyperion.


&nbsp;


""Well,” said Father Hoyt, obviously recovered from the heavy dose of ultramorph and teetering on the delicate balance between pain and sedation, “what do we do next?”


(This previous paragraph is an excerpt from: Dan Simmons. “Hyperion Cantos [01] - Hyperion."")



&nbsp;


If you want to read more, I recommend the afformentioned book. It's available in print, electronic and audio and the audiobook presentation is quite fantastic. The first time I read this book I was pulled wanting to see where things go with the opioid addicted priest but was immersed by the authors use of prose and just the sheer concept of a motherfucking tree ship! 


A ship that had various spheres around it and on it, containment fields of various types are the chief means of maintaining atmosphere but also augment structural integrity. The ship is a Kilometer long and derives 1/6th Earth gravity from a singularity imprisoned at it's base. It's FTL capable via the use of a Hawking drive which still causes the traveler to incur time debt which is Simmons' choice term for time dilation.

&nbsp;

Typically a tree ship will make short scenic journeys for affluent passengers and avoid incurring more than six months of time debt. For the journey to Hyperion however, the travelers incur three years time debt while spending less than six months sleeping in cryogenic fugue couches.


&nbsp;


If you want a good book series and like a little sci-fi combined with philosophy, adventure, war and a little politics then I recommend the four books of The Hyperion Cantos. Hyperion, and Fall of Hyperion stand together. Endymion and Rise of Endymion are set further in the future but those two books also stand together.


There were rumors that it was gonna be made into a TV movie but it's not happening. So if you see any optimistic articles about a movie rendition of Hyperion, double check the date and origin of the news.",1520966790.0

I started Subs 5 weeks ago with no major issues (anxiety mostly), but yesterday I woke up at 5am with a terrible sore throat and had been feeling like crap the past couple days, lethargic etc. Took some NyQuil thinking I was getting sick. Woke up at 9am and got approved to work from home. Around noon I looked in the mirror to look at throat and noticed my tongue had waves all around the edges, and was very swollen, more than my throat. The whole underside is ballooning out (to the point where I can see large purple veins) but is not impeding breathing. Took an antihistamine just in case and waited. Still swollen hours later, Aleve as well.

I went to an urgent care after work, and they gave me a cortisone shot in my arm, Benadryl, swabbed for strep, and a prednisone script and antibiotics. I am shocked if it’s an allergic reaction since it’s been 5 weeks.
The swelling hasn’t gone down much at all since yesterday, tho my throat seems to feel much better. I guess my question is, what could this be? Doc seems convinced it’s allergic but seems weird to me! I also don’t have a Suboxone doctor and only a couple Subs left- don’t know if I will be able to get any Subtex in case it is allergy related.

Basically, with Discover, I opened a card last year and maxed it out over time. I made payments on it I think for 8 or 9 months straight before hitting a snag and now I'm at 3 months of no payments. I did speak to someone from collections after the 1st month missed and told them I had no job at that time, even though they kept pushing and pushing to schedule a payment, in the end nothing happened and that was that. I told them I'd make a payment as soon as I have a job. So now after 3 months, getting more serious calls. People leaving messages, like ""Mr. Smith, you are in some serious trouble, this is not a sales call, please call me back at XXXX concerning your Discover card, this is very very serious"".

They call it ""rebujao, rebujina, revuelto"" or a variation thereof, and it translates as 'scramble' (I saw someone us this word for the first time on this subreddit, so I thought it might be the same thing).

It consists of #3 heroin plus base cocaine powder, usually in a 3/1 or 4/1 ratio, and in many places you can only get H prepared in this way, as the majority of consumers there chase on foil, and don't shoot up after our huge heroin/AIDS epidemic in the 80. 

I'm not complaining because my ROA was also smoking, and on the occasions in which I just bought heroin base, it sizzled a lot on the foil and burnt very quickly, leaving huge black tracks like the ones I see on pictures of foil used for BTH, whereas with this method you can smoke the whole beetle and leave (almost) nothing on the foil, depending on how experienced you are with chasing.

This is the main reason I've heard for the addition of cocaine base, as you can easily get 20-30 hits out of it if you do it properly, so in my opinion it is more relaxing because of the longer duration.

In some of the slum areas of the city where I lived they would sell you a point of cocaine base and another one of H for a very small price, so you could mix at your leisure.

(Also, an embedded mini-question. About this cocaine base I mentioned, which was simply called 'base' by users, I had been told that it was crack, or very similar. It definitely isn't the south american cocaine paste, because this stuff is fine white powder, not rocks nor pasty stuff.

I have seen people preparing it with ammonia or bicarbonate on a spoon, heating it and scraping it off when dry, which makes me think crack, but then again, when they smoke it they use the same method as with heroin-chasing, and it turns into a translucent blob or beetle. So the mini-question is, do you know what this is exactly? Can crack also be vapourised on foil, or does it always need direct flame? Also, I though crack was usually in rock form.)

Sorry for the length, and thank you in advance. I have been living for a few months in a distant, freezing land where anything is really expensive and they don't even sell proper H, just substitutes, so all I have left is vintage wine and memories.",1520953982.0

Anyway, long story still long, I meet him and he hands me a hands me a bag full of 30 yellow pills. Again, I was like, “shit.” Cause these weren’t 15’s. So while we’re there I google them. Have you guys ever heard of t188’s?? First time I’ve ever had them and they are so bomb! They hit you in like 10 minutes just from chewing them up!

So I chewed up 5 of them and am laying on my couch watching Crashing. A nice little 3 week tolerance break does the body good!

***SWEEPING GENERALIZATIONS***

***BROAD STATEMENTS***

***OPINION***




Sometimes it's hard to put a finger on, and other times: not so much. It also will surely vary from person to person, and opinion to opinion, but to me it's this: 


Reddit, originally, and to this day, is a pretty nerdy place. Lots of talk of code, gaming, cryptos, math, science, intense DIY projects, engineering, photography, music; basically a melting pot of people coming together to nerd out on whatever it is they nerd out on. 

Then there is us. Then there is r/opiates. 

A place where some thousands of people come together to nerd out on a epidemic that's killing us, killing a part of a generation, and causing ripples of destruction that leave no lives untouched. 

Sure, you can spin it; and yes, I have spun it. Harm reduction, and helping people learn how to shoot up the right way, and they are going to do it anyway. I get it.

 All I'm saying is that I find it weird that there are so many of us nerding out on, and basically celebrating death. And it becomes glaringly obvious when the sub catches the eye of the national media, and for three days straight you see headlines like: ""a dark place on Reddit where addicts Etc"".  


I see the strangeness most in what I call 'the spill over users'. Normal nerdy kids who probably got on Reddit to nerd out on normal nerdy things, found their way in to this sub, and have become daily users. I know that's what a lot of people on here are from IRL encounters. I also chalk up most the people in their 'functioning’ phase up to spill over. Nerding out on opiates while it might still be 'fun'. 

But the thing I've learned on this path, in this life, is that no matter what, it never stays fun for long. It's not a “normal” thing to do, even if it's “under control”, and most importantly: it's not a game. Like so many sub topics on reddit, it's not a game. Everyday we die. People in this sub die. The people you meet when you make it to recovery die; and those are the lucky ones. There's also the countless others reduce to life behind bars, losing years of the only life they'll ever get, all for our topic of choice to nerd out on. 

I'm sure this will get all kinds of backlash, that's cool bros and broettes. If you aren't getting backlash on the web, then you aren't doing it right. I mean, what's the point of having a platform, on which you're completely anonymous, speaking to others who are anonymous, if you're not going to use it?  


I do hope that this post won't catch a mod though. That would make me sad. I'm just expressing my own opinion based off of years of observation, and I'm more than open to hearing the opinions of others. 

***TO SUM IT UP***

I'm not hating on this sub, or saying if should be changed in anyway at all. I've been on this sub off and on for a long time, and this is me coming back from a long time without, and I just felt able to put into words what I've always felt so strange about this sub. 


No matter what: please be safe out there. It's a mad, mad world for our kind.",1520933215.0

I am using the speech to text tool on my phone so it's going to be off. Recently I started reading about the cops ability to pose as drug dealers rather than drug buyers and that they are allowed to actually sell drugs to customers. This is supposedly done to either scare customers away from a certain area because the customers start to believe that all the dealers are cops. Or the cops just completely take over the area driving out other dealers and then stop selling there and kill the area. However I was curious with them selling drugs can they sell real drugs? Where do they get the real drugs? And if the police officer sell a user real drugs are they liable if the user dies from the drugs? Can these officers be prosecuted? Some of these questions I ask because I know a lot of the laws to do with selling and buying drugs and how it's not entrapment or illegal for the cops to do so is based on intent so that is to take into consideration I guess. There just isn't I haven't found that much information on the subject and if anyone could point me in the direction to find more information or know the information themselves or certain cases that would be awesome thanks.

This would have me lit AF, it was the most euphoric feeling I’ve ever felt. Of course I haven’t tried dillies or pandas or H but this was the best thing since sliced bread in my experience. It was very intense too and it stayed that way for at least 1 1/2 months, maybe 2, only using weekly.

Then all of a sudden out of nowhere, I take 60/100mg of hydro/DPH respectively one Sunday to get even more lit, and it did almost nothing. Like literally a week ago less then that had gotten me fucked up. This was dramatic, and it was the same way a few more times over the next week or two. 

At first I thought it was just tolerance, but then I remembered that during this period of time I had used a small amount of subboxone on two occasions (cause why not). Both times I fucked up the ROA mostly and thought I got nothing since I didn’t feel anything, but that would explain the loss of potency if I did get any In my system right? Well even 96 hours out from the subb I still felt only the smallest of buzzes. Something else had to be at play here. 

Then I remembered something else; during this time frame I had just started a new psych med, cymbalta aka ‘duloxetine’ which is an SNRI. I’d never experienced any inhibiting effects from any of my other meds but this seemed to coincidental. I decided to experiment and stopped taking it for a few days. This isn’t advised at all but I was on the lowest dose once a day and didn’t notice any w/d effects coming off. Sure enough, tonight after three days without I got a STRONG buzz going. I used 60/100mg hydro/DPH cause I know my tolerance is up in the short term, but I even took it on a ~ half full stomach and it still hit like a truck. 

There must be something up with the way SNRIs effect dopamine in the brain that explains this, or maybe it’s effects on serotonin and norepinephrine are responsible. Either way I just wanted to share this experience with everyone, if thats not at all how SNRIs work and I have no idea what I’m talking about please chime in and let me know what you know about the subject. Whatever the case, I’m not gonna be on cymbalta long term, just a few weeks to deal with a severe bout of acute depression. If it is blocking opiates effects effects then I guess everything will go back to normal after that, assuming I keep my tolly low lol.

84ivr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/84ivr6/a221_tramadol/,2,https://redd.it/84ivr6,needtopass00,A221 Tramadol,"So it's been a rough night and I can't find shit but tramadol.  I found 10 of these A221 tramadols and they are 100 mg.  I took 4 and don't really feel a fuckin thing.  Typically about 150 mgs of tram will give me noticeable effects.

Anyways.. I went back and looked online and these motherfuckers say extended release and I just swallowed them straight up.. did I fuck myself out of a high? (If u can even call tramadol buzz a high lol)...  


I have 5 more should I chew one up to kick it off?   that'd be 500 mgs of tram tho..  I can NOT have a seizure.  I'm here with my beautiful, awesome wife who I do not deserve and my two year old boy who I can not put through that drama.  I also took 2/3 of a 2mg hulk Xanax (daily dose, once per day and it's usually 1/3 of the bar, not 2/3).

Just for the record I am not fucked up AT ALL lol.  I do not get wrecked around the fam.  There's weekends they go out of town for that.  I wouldn't hop in the vehicle and start cruising around just bc that's not right at any level of enebriation but I'm good to chill with the fam. 

Tolerance right now is 100 mgs of oxy for a decent high orally and 130 would put me in borderline sick territory (if taken all at once).   Lemme know what you think homies!!

Oh.. and I gotta work at 6:30am and it's almost 9 so that's a factor too!

Im always lookin for new plugs(we can NEVER have too many, am I right?) So about a week ago while I was sittin in my court ordered substance abuse program, I noticed one of my fellow classmates was texting on two different phones, one was a regular smart phone, but the other was an old school flip phone(the kind that you have to push a numeric key multiple times when texting) and immediately my junkie senses started tingling and i knew it had to be a burner phone. So after the class I asked dude(btw he is much younger than I am...prob very early 20's) if he knew ""where dat work at?"" And he said nah...so fast forward to yesterday and during class young blood legit slipped me a folded up note that said ""I got what u wanted last week...you still need that? Y/N? I almost laughed out loud just bc of the situation itself. So I circled the Y and put ""but low on $"", slipped it back to him and a few min later I get another not saying ""Dont Worry..Gotchu...tlk after class""
Once class was over me and dude went outfront...i told him I only had like $7 on me and I had to leave like ATM bc my wife was waitin for me in the parkin lot...dude took the $7 and told me to just go to the Bodega thats right next to where we have our group...I asked how long it would take, how far, etc and he assured me that he would be back b4 i finished a cig.....shore enough he pulled up right as i was about to flick my butt and head to the parking lot to go home. He threw me 2 stamps and gave me his # told me to let him know how it was. Did both bags and the quality was pretty weak...still got me high but creeped up...the good feedback I gave him was that they were pretty phat bags and it was def only dope and no fent. So we texted a bit back n forth about prices and shit..and i told him that i middle for a lot of people, some who get decent sized orders once in awhile..and that if he can deliver its a plus and i would do my best to start sending him some fresh business.
☆☆☆THE FOLLOWING IS THE PART IN MY STORY WHEN I ACTUALLY FOOLED THE DBOY INTO GIVING ME FREE BAGS☆☆☆☆

SO SORRY about preceeding wall of text/backstory...but i did warn you that I tend to do that when im high!
So based off the convo/interaction I had last night with this younger, Latiner, reincarnation of Frank Lucas I was able to pick up on the fact that he must be new to the Dope hustle. Im positive he has hustled drugs before though bc he was on probation for selling tree, and he may have also dabbled in buying/flippin some yay bc that was brought up during our conversation, but ask any experienced OG dopeboy and they will tell you that serving dope heads is completely different, you gotta go by an entirely different code when dealin with a fiend and I could tell that my new friend El Chapo Jr. Wasn't hip to that yet.
So today I tell the young entrepreneur that i have like 3-4 ""friends"" who have fairly steady habits and buy regularly, but they aint beat on plugs. I say ""they got plenty of connects so its not like they need you, but what their plugs lack in is convenience"" I start tellin Jr. That my boys are constantly bitchin that they gotta make a 2hr round trip out to some shady ass hood to pick up, and they hate drivin long distances dirty, the plugs they do have will make them be at the spot at a specific time then end up making them wait on hot blocks for 45min or longer sometimes, and they are always tellin me that the shit out in the open air markets is getting tainted with fent more n more and they aint bout that. The one thing that is always consistent about them buyin from the corner boys is the prices cant be beat and this new kid def cant match what they are payin( we are talkin a $20 difference between buns & $100 diff on a brick). So I tell the self proclaimed ""trap star""  that we he lacks on the price he makes up for with convenience...He is a lot closer, he is mobil and willing to deliver, and has nice quality work that is fent free and phat bags...""BUT"" I then say ""They aren't going to want to switch to some new shit without at least trying out a sample""...""yeah, no doubt i could give them a sample or 2 each"" he says...""Where they at though? They out your way now?.. (Here is when I take advantage, manipulate, and go in for the kil) I start feeding him professional grade BS by saying shit like ""nah they arent around at the moment...they either workin or still asleep...but im plannin on getting up with them later today or tomorrow and could throw them each some sample if you wanna leave it with me""...He was hesitant with that and was like ""i can bring it out your way just hmu when they around and ill bring it over...i wanna make sure they get it ya know""...i was like ""Bro they gonna get it...i want them to start getting from you instead of the city boys bc theyll have to hmu when they need it and ill profit off whatever they pick up from you......YADDA YADDA....so we do the back n forth a bit until i finally convince him that they gonna get the samples and im probably gonna see the one dude on his lunch break...but im gonna be leavin soon to run errands and go to some appts so i need him to come drop them off to me asap (hes only a 10min drive)....and SUCCESS! homeboy COMES TO ME! to deliver the samples and he gives me 2 bags for each of my 3 homies plus an additional 3 to me for helpin him get new business...and tells me he got my back if i bring him repeat business! Sooo i got myself 9 bags of some decent shit....and i actually do have friends i middle for that i will easily be able to use to bring him business without having to give them ""samples""...BITCH WHAT I LOOK LIKE? A FUCKIN COSTCO

On Saturday I had to take my oldest cat (who I’ve had since I was 18) to the vet. She wasn’t eating/drinking and was on death’s door. They were able to stabilize her and adjust her thyroid medication. She still isn’t eating enough but she has been eating/drinking some. She’s on a few other medications for now and I have to bring her back to the vet next Wednesday. She has the onset of kidney problems and I know that she will may not live much longer. 

I took today off work because it is the three year anniversary of my suicide attempt. (Pi Day=Die Day!) It’s become somewhat of a holiday for me- like an anti-birthday? I like to be alone, get high on the same drugs I used that fateful day (Xanax, heroin, sleep aids) but in a much lower, non-lethal dose. I’ve spent this afternoon playing with my cats and pampering myself. So much has changed in the last 3 years, I feel like I’ve grown in some areas and stagnated in others. My depression is now managed with therapy and last February I received IV ketamine treatments which have basically cured my suicidal ideations/major depression. I still get down but it is not anywhere near what it used to be. 

Three years ago today I was in and out of consciousness which forced my best friend to call an ambulance on my ass when I proceeded to eat a whole box of sleeping pills in my Xanax/heroin haze. He saved my life and I put him in a really unfair position. We are still best friends after all that and are even now able to joke about it. 

Sorry for the shit post. This doesn’t really have much of a point. I would like to thank r/opiates for being a group I can always talk openly about my depression and drug use.

The rare times an artery was hit the only way I knew was the pain and lack of rush.  Generally a vein used a bunch seems to get brighter in color after being dark at first.  I'm guessing this is due to the vein being 'leaky'? Which I've also heard is one reason why a rush will be less intense and also another reason to rotate sites.

Iit’s real interesting how it all started for me. I met a guy and had been talking to him for about a month before we started hanging out. The last time we hung out, I smoked my last gram in secrecy. The reason I say “last time we hung out” is because as of today, we still haven’t left each other’s side. I quit cold turkey when I wasnt even expecting to. I had physical withdrawals but I was so mentally headstrong that I didnt care or worry about it. 

I am free. 

I have since cut off all ties with my old dboys and I moved. I also filed for my LLC and in the process of starting up my own business.

Don’t get me wrong...I’m still broke lol but being broke and having a full fridge, rent and all the bills paid is a LOT different than being broke, not caring about food only dope and being months behind on bills.

There are days where I feel the pains in my spine and crave the pain warm feeling of an opiate to ease it but I remind myself that’s what started this in the first place and I’ll smoke some weed and play Overwatch instead.

So if anyone wants to talk I’m here.
If anyone wants to get in on some Overwatch (ps4 or Xbox) hmu with your gamer tag and I’ll add you.

My boyfriend will never know what he has done for me and I’m not sure I ever want to tell him because I don’t want him to look at me differently or judge me.

So a few weeks ago i copped a few bags to not feel like shit and i got fucked up like i havent been in ages. Serious euphoria and heavy. heavy nod. So ive been copping buns basically on the daily now but most stamps just take away the w/d and only certain stamps actually get me fucked up, and i havent tried snorting it because of all the shitty experiences doing that has brought me. SO if you've read this far anyone have any clue whats going on here?",1521052413.0

Like the time I was lead blindfolded into the bathroom of a trap house after midnight in nap town.

It was around midnight and I was starting to get sick.  I had already resigned myself to a sleepless night of cold sweats and restless legs when my phone rang.  It was the plug.

“Yo mayne, get yoself over to da spot. Bring yo works witchu.”

“Alright bet, I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”

Shit, he didn’t have to ask me twice. I had just moved to the city from a small town about an hour away, so I was able to convince the guy who used to score for me to introduce me to the plug; and living closer to the plug than most of his customers, which were almost exclusively white kids from the country or the suburbs, had its perks.  He had mentioned he might hit me up to try a new batch for him, but I never expected him to actually follow through with it.  I had my shoes on and was out the door in ten seconds flat.  

I had only been to this particular spot during daylight hours.  It was this ghetto fucking apartment complex across from a wal-mart.  The place was at the very back of the complex which were these single story shithole apartments on either side of a pot-hole strewn road.  One way in, one way out… a trap in every sense of the word.  I remember thinking in the back of my head, “what the fuck are you doing? This is a bad idea.” But the sickness was in control and pushed those thoughts back in favor of getting well.  Fuck it, I know this dude.  I see him damn near every day, he has no reason to rob me or beat me down. I pulled up and called him to let him know I was there.  I pocketed my spoon and rig and got out of the car, waiting for him to come out. After a few minutes I hear a door open and some guy I’d never seen before came over to me.

“Yo, you freddy?”

“Yeah man, MC told me to come out here.”

“Yeah, you gonna try out some new shit for us.”

“Fine by me. I’ll just go to that Walmart over there and try it out.”

“Nah man, you gotta come inside. Come on, follow me.”

Alarm bells starting ringing in my head, but fuck it, I’ve already come this far.  No way I’m going back home empty handed.  I followed him to the apartment door, but before he opened the door he took his jacket off and told me to put it over my head so I couldn’t see anything.  I did as instructed, and was lead inside.  The second I stepped in a cloud of weed smoke hit me head on, dank as fuck.  I said something stupid like, “damn, smells good in here fellas,” while the dude lead me across the room and into a hallway.  He opened a bathroom door and took the jacket off my head and handed me two small rocks before closing the door behind him.

I cooked up my shot and blasted off.  Knocked on the bathroom door when I was done and got lead back out to my car.

“So watchu think mayne?”

“It’s good man.  Not any better than the regular shit, but certainly not any worse.”

“Alright alright, that’s what’s up. Come through tomorrow, I’ll hook you up fat.”

“Hell yeah man, I appreciate it. If you ever need a tester, you know where to find me.”

And that is why it’s not always a bad thing for a white guy to be lead blindfolded into a trap house full of drug dealers in the ghetto.

So I turn to my boy laughing and said ""Did Andy really just barge in here and run in your room like we didn't see him?""

""Uhhhh yeah, that definately was him.""

We both go into his room where my buddy is like, ""Andy?! What the fuck are you doing?""

Andy, "" Dude, they kicked me out of the methadone clinic, for pissing dirty for xanax and I feel like shit, and I just pissed my bed. I JUST REALLY NEED YOUR COMPANY BRO. I NEED A FRIEND.""

My buddy responds, ""You came about it the wrong way bro. Get the fuck out of my bed before I beat the shit out of you.""

I am still laughing in the background.

Funniest thing that has happened to me in a while. He was on like 200+ mg of methadone and was warned that if benzos show up on his tox screen that they have to discharge him. So I really dont feel bad for him.

I was also told this could be PAWS, but I only used for about 6 months. I don’t even know if that’s long enough to have any long term damage.

But recently I’ve been very curious, I hear how much better it is people saying it’s the god mother of all opiates. 

I wanna ask would you guys think snorting or eating heroin is much safer than IV’ing it? I know it’s dangerous either way but a honest question I have is, can heroin be safe if you control your dosage and don’t actually get careless or reckless with it? I hear about people OD’ing all the time but I hear it’s mainly from IV’ing it. Don’t these people OD because they get careless and think they can do more than they can handle? As dumb as it may sound I honestly think heroin can be safe if you can control what amount you snort or don’t snort as much. I understand addiction is very difficult thing and hard to control but let’s say hypothetical speaking if you can control your doses then heroin can be a safe drug? Basically you control heroin don’t let it control you respect the drug. 

Anyways back to me. Like I said I’m very curious in trying it. I do have rules for myself and I absolutely hate needles I can’t stand them. I have always vowed to myself that I will never IV any opiates regardless of the hype or how good it may feel, it’s just not my cup of tea and I don’t wanna go down a dark road I can’t escape. Anyways I don’t think I wouldn’t mind trying to snort a little bit just to see what the hype is about. I feel like even if I did start doing heroin I would only snort/eat it only never needles. I also feel like I could always measure out the amount I snort and not get careless with it trying to chase a bigger high/rush. So far being on oxy’s I have controlled myself well not going overboard just sticking to oxy 15’s and 20’s sometimes 30’s. I feel like I have enough self control over my body to try heroin. I also believe family, friends, and bills would always come first before a Heroin rush. Life is so much more important then chasing a rush for just a few hours. 

But anyways give me your guys advice and opinions of what you think. Do you guys think heroin can be a safe drug if controlled and just snorted only. ",1521029672.0

84stp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/84stp6/my_experience_getting_prescribed_an_obscene/,11,https://redd.it/84stp6,Dillydude8487,My experience getting prescribed an obscene amount of dilaudid after a major surgery,"About a year ago I had to have a relatively major surgery to correct a dent in my chest, they gave me lots of painkillers. It was really fun until it wasn’t. 

About 6 months out of the surgery I was taking maybe 2-6 mg of Xanax a day to help cope with the anxiety of what I knew would be a very painful and long recovery. I was buying off the street so doses are hard to pinpoint. Leading up to the surgery I cut down to a bar or less per day and I didn’t take any about 24 hours prior to hopefully prevent any complications with the anesthesia.

When I woke up I had an epidural so pain wasn’t really an issue. They transitioned me to a fentanyl IV drip with one of those fun buttons for extra dosing as needed. Of course I pressed it as often as allowed cause might as well take advantage of a powerful IV drip while I had the chance. They then transitioned me to a less intense IV drip which I think was morphine or dilaudid I’m not sure. 

I should also mention I was getting Valium every few hours to prevent muscle spasms and such.

In order to go home I had to be off IV so they started me on dilaudid pills and would check my pain level every so often to see if they needed to increase the dose. Because I’m a degenerate and I knew they’d increase the dose if I played it right I told them my pain level was 8or9/10 every time they asked. This was pretty accurate but also I just wanted a bigger script so I could stockpile the dilly for later enjoyment. 

Eventually they had me on the max dose allowable for my size which was 8mg dilaudid and 5mg of Valium every four hours. Shortly after I was able to get myself out of bed and walk i was sent home. I then started this wonderful cycle of meds, it went a little something like this:

1. Take 8mg dilaudid, be in pain for 30 minutes waiting for it to kick in.

2. 30 min-1hr it starts to kick in and I begin to nod, this was the most fun part cause I was still vaguely conscious and my pain level was beginning to lower.

3. Hour 1-2 continue to nod off. My buddy who helped watch over me told me that I would fall asleep mid-sentence or fall asleep holding my phone up and it was relatively funny to watch. It was also relatively fun to experience.

4. Hour 2 take dose of Valium and pass out again for about an hour.

5. Hour 3-4 start to regain consciousness as the dilly wore off slightly and start to get really pissed off and generally act like an asshole to anyone around me.

6. 4 hours after last dose of dilaudid I take another and repeat this wonderful cycle.


During this time I was dabbing a lot and would also take maybe a bar a day in addition to the prescribed meds.

My mom (bless her) would wake me up day and night to give me my doses until a week in she was tired with my bullshit and refused to wake me up in the middle of the night to give me my medicine. She set my doses out next to me but I was too out of it to be able to wake myself up when I needed so I ended up waking up the next morning in the middle of withdrawal. 

That was complete ass.

I tried to take some as soon as I realized I was in withdrawal but it was too late the nausea/puking had already started so anytime I attempted to take a pill I would throw it back up almost immediately. To add insult to injury since they had to cut through chest muscle and muscle on the sides of my body every puke/dry heave was incredibly painful. Dabbing helped but it was still hell. 

I got so pissed off that my parents allowed me to go into withdrawal (my dad’s a surgeon so he should’ve known what would happen if I missed a dose) that I intentionally ate a bunch of fruit snacks knowing I would puke them up shortly after hoping that it would be in a room that they would have to clean up. My plan didn’t work out and I just ended up puking in a trash can in my own room. 

I don’t know if withdrawal is the same for everyone but I was almost constantly dry heaving, sweating and feeling hot/cold at the same time, and just a general horrible feeling that I can’t describe very well. 

18 or so hours later of wreaking havoc in my house I finally caved and my parents took me to the hospital. As you may know withdrawal patients are a relatively low priority so I was stuck in the waiting room for 3 hours. Once I got a room I then had to wait another hour or so for a doctor to actually treat me. They gave me IV fluids to re-hydrate me and some powerful anti-nausea medication that helped tremendously. The IV fluids were quite cold and I think helped with the feeling of swapping between feverish and freezing, it kept me at the freezing feeling which I guess is better than continuously swapping back and forth every minute or so.

After I was relatively stable they did a chest x-ray to make sure I didn’t knock the metal bars out of place and I was put back in the same hospital room I had occupied just a week prior. They gave me some kind of sleeping med and I woke up in that room alone still withdrawing. The only thing keeping me going was knowing that once I got home even if I wasn’t going to take the painkillers again (I decided that I was done with narcotics to treat my pain as the withdrawal was literal hell and they caused me to treat people I really care about like shit) I would at least be able to dab and keep my spirits up. 

Unfortunately I was deemed a risk to myself as somewhere in the middle of that day of hell I had mentioned I didn’t want to be alive anymore... real surprise there. So I had to have a nurse in the same room make shitty conversation with me as I waited for psychiatrists to either decide to commit me to the psych ward or clear me to go home. Let me tell you the last thing I wanted to do while withdrawing was make friendly small talk. At least she was kind of hot lol.

I told them everything they wanted to hear and they cleared me to go home. My next task before I was allowed to go home was to eat a full meal to prove I wasn’t nauseous anymore so I wasn’t at risk of messing up my surgery. I did that with relative ease and was cleared to go home. Once I was cleared to leave a nurse came in and asked me if I would like any narcotics for the pain. I’m pretty sure I said “fuck no” but I may have been more polite, either way that’s the message I sent.

When I got home I immediately went to my room to dab but my parents had cleared out all of my shit. ~100 xans, a big bong, a dab rig, some pipes, some weed, a few grams of dabs, the absolute works. I had been buying weed stuff for 3-4 years at this point and it was all gone. They let me have stuff in the house just as long as I didn’t smoke inside they were just unaware of how extensive my collection actually was.

The next 3-6 months were hell as I dealt with the pain with no chemical help. I couldn’t drive to pick up anything and I didn’t have any way to make money even if I had the ability to purchase anything. Normally people stay on narcotics for at least 3 months sometimes up to a year or even the entire duration that the bars are in place.

The silver lining is the pain from the surgery masked the suckiness of withdrawal so I wasn’t too focused on that. Unfortunately (probably fortunately) my parents also got rid of the 100s of 8mg dilaudid and 5mg Valium pills that I was planning to stockpile. 

1 year and a few months later I’m lurking this subreddit drooling over the dope porn posts wishing I could relive that feeling. I think the only thing that could come close to or beat it would be straight up H and that scares the shit out of me. I never thought I would legitimately consider trying to find some but I can’t get the memory of that overload of dopamine and not giving a shit about anything out of my head.

Oh well. I don’t think I’ll do it but who knows. I have athletics to distract me for now I just hope things continue to go well or I’ll probably end up using. 

Fuck prescriptions. If I only used weed for pain management during that time I know I wouldn’t even consider using. I hate that I got a preview of what hard opiates are like. It’s very tempting especially living in the H capital of the U.S. I could probably find some easily if I really tried.

The guy I bought my dope from stopped selling dope and could only get some sort of fentanyl analog. It is cut a ton but the thing is I have no idea how much I am using or where my tolerance is at really. 

I took .5mg of suboxone, but either I took it too early, or my tolerance is so high and this fentanyl shit is so strong that suboxone is ineffective. I began to get super duper sick. Kicking around in bed sweating, shitting, the works. I ate over 60mg of diazepam trying to get myself to calm down and feel better. The next day I didnt feel better either but continued taking subs. All in all I took about 12mg but felt totally sick and not normal at all. Do you think this was PWD? How long do PWD last? Am I totally fucked and incapable of getting onto subs without getting super sick for days? I really want out of this and I dont know what to do. I picked up some fent the next night and felt okay again.

In the past, I have used suboxone to combat WD and just felt normal. I was able to function and whatever it was relatively painless. Now I really really want to switch to subs, but the other day was so strange and painful that I am absolutely terrified I will never be okay again.

Whatever fent analog I have been taking has a pretty short half life, within 4 or 5 hours I can feel WD creeping in, and I always have to wake up in the middle of the night to dose or I will not get back to sleep and just get sick. 

I guess my main question is, does anyone have experience kicking fent analogs with subs? Any advice? How do I get out of this I want nothing more than just be normal again",1521172510.0

“Smells like fucking coke dude. This isn’t dope, I’m telling you.  Call him up, I can’t do a fucking thing with a ball of hard bro,” I snapped back at him.  I had been sick all morning, and finally now after rounding up everyone’s money and making the hour drive up here, I get sold a bunch of fucking crack.

“Goddammit,” Cory said to himself as he dialed the number and held the phone up to his ear.

The phone must have rung about a dozen times – and right before I was sure that bitch was about to say, “you have reached the voicemail box of…” I heard a click and a gruff voice say, “Yeah.”

“Dude, what the fuck.  I told you we needed that boi.  No dude.  No this is straight up crack.  Well I don’t know what to tell you man; it’s white and hard and smells faintly like gas.  Alright.  Yeah.  Alright, okay.  Yup, alright let me know.”

“Let’s just drive over to 38th street and park at a safeway or a gas station and ask some people.  It’s worked for me a couple of times,” Cory said.

“I’m not asking random fucking people for dope dude.  If you want to you can, but I’m not about to get my ass beat trying to score.”

“You gonna break me off?”

“If you can find it.”

And with that, two dopesick white boys headed off to the sketchiest part of the city in search of their fix.  I’m always really grateful not to have to drive when I’m sick – I’ve almost gotten in more than one accident just from the sheer carelessness that comes with withdrawal.  At least the weather was alright, not too hot, not too cold… not that it made much of a difference – even if it were the dead of winter I’d still be covered in sweat.  I tried passing the time on my phone, texting just about anybody on my contact list who could theoretically find something.  We spent most of the ride in silence, listening to some woman on NPR drone on about tiger moms or some shit.  I sometimes feel bad about how antisocial I get when I’m sick – it’s not that the people I’m with are annoying me per say, it’s just that I can never think of anything worthwhile to say.  On dope I just don’t give a fuck and will chat about anything under the sun, but once that sweet diacetyl slides back off of its receptors in my brain, all of that anxiousness and self-doubt come creeping back in.  After about a thirty minute drive through the city, Cory pulls off into a Safeway parking lot.

“Alright man, here goes nothing.  Let me see your pack of cigs, I’m just gonna stand out front smoking and wait for somebody to try and bum one,” Cory said as he looked around the parking lot nervously.

“Good luck I guess; I’ll be chillin right here.  Here’s the fifty, don’t forget the rules – this is all we got left in the world right now.  The money never walks, no matter what.  I’d rather stay sick than get ripped off again,” I said, handing over the fifty and my pack of smokes after taking a few out for myself.

I watched him stand out there, smoking and nervously pacing back and forth, for what seemed like an eternity, but in reality was only two full cigarettes worth of time.  After his third cigarette which he flicked onto the curb, when I was sure he was about to give up and start walking back toward my car, an older black dude appeared seemingly out of nowhere.  I was too far away to hear anything they were saying, but after a few seconds Cory points toward me and the car, nodding his head. 

“No fucking way,” I said aloud as they both started walking toward me.  “Not a fucking chance I’m this lucky.”

“Yo man, so this guy says he can get it just right down the road, he just needs a ride over there,” Cory said through the driver’s window.

“Well fuck man, let’s go!” I replied, trying not to let my excitement show.

They both hopped in the car and after getting directions from the old man we pulled out onto the main drag, headed back the way we came.

“So… uh, just to make sure, we’ll be able to see it before we hand the money over, right?”  I asked, twisting back in my seat to face him.  “It’s nothing against you, we just got ripped off for like 300 bucks a little while ago… so I’m just not trying to let my money walk twice in one day without seeing what I’m getting.”

“Yea, yea, I gotchu fam I gotchu.  Damn son, somebody gotchu for 300 already? What the fuck happen, you just gave him the money and watched him walk off?”

“Not exactly.  We got something for it, just not what we were looking for,” I said, still craning my neck around to talk.

“Well watchu get?”

“Just a bunch of fuckin' hard.""

“Oh word? What's the matter, you white boys don’t like crack no more?”

“I mean, it’s just not what I was trying for today.""

“So y’all don’t even want it?”

“Apparently the dude is planning on making it right, but I don’t trust it.""

“Shiiiit, just trade that shit to me then fool, get what you was tryin to in the first place.”

Cory and I exchanged hopeful glances with each other, his eyes darting back and forth in a way that very specifically said, “Play it cool man, we don’t want to let him know how desperate we are to get either the money or the product – if he senses even the slightest hesitation or weakness we’ll end up with a pennies on the dollar trade.”  After a few years of almost daily trips to the city and back, our body language and silent communication skills were on point.

“I mean, we might could work something out,” I said.  “Just need to see what we’re working with first, then we can talk business.

About a minute later we pulled up to what looked like an abandoned house.  Broken windows, overgrown yard, boarded up doors, the works.

“Aight, you two just stay put, I’ma run inside and grab it right quick,” the old man said as he hopped out of the car with a surprising amount of speed for his age.

So we sat.  And we sat.  And we sat.  Finally, after we had nearly killed the pack of smokes from chain-smoking over the last 45 minutes, the old man reappeared from out behind the house. 

“Holy shit, he actually came back,” I said, finally allowing myself a little bit of hope.  “I’d have put money on it that he was never gonna show back up.”

He hopped back in my car and pulled out a ziplock that was filled with what looked to be full g and half g rocks.  He handed me one of the halves and said, “Aight young bloods here it be. Take a look.”

I opened the bag and took a quick whiff.  Yep, that’s definitely dope. 
 
Cory handed him the fifty and said, “Alright so what are you trying to do for this hard?” holding up the bag of rocks for him to see. 

“Lemme see one of them bitches,” he said, holding out his hand palm up.

Cory took out one of the rocks and handed it back to him, which he promptly shoved into a crack pipe which had seemingly appeared out of thin air.  Before I could say anything, he had already lit up and was taking a fat rip.  “Fuck it,” I thought, glancing around and hoping to god nobody was paying us any attention.

After a full twenty seconds of silence, the old man smiled broadly and said, “Shiiiit, that’s what’s up my niggas.  How bout dis.  How bout, seein as how I’m doin ya’ll  a favor here, I give you a quarter gram for every gram of hard you got.”

“Fuuuck, dude.  You’re killing us here,” Cory said, feigning shock.  “I was thinking more like a half g for every g of hard.""

“Naaaahhh man, I can’t do that, I can’t do that.  How much you got there total? Fuck it, here, just throw it on this scale,” the old man said, yet again summoning an object out of thin air.  

“It’s 5g with the bag,” Cory said, moving the bag on and off the scale to double check the numbers.

“Hm... aight, aight here’s what I'ma do for ya'll niggas.  I’ll do 2.0 for all of it, and just cause I like you two niggas I’ll even throw in an extra half.  So you got two and a half total.""

Cory and I glanced at each other, coming to the silent understanding that this was an acceptable trade after a quick mental calculation.  Anticipation was rising steadily in my chest, and I wanted nothing more in the world than to just get the fuck out of there to do a shot.  

“Alright man, we can do that,” Cory said as he turned around to make the exchange.
  
“Aight, aight, cool. Pleasure doing business with ya’ll niggas.”

And with that, the old black man stepped back out of my car and walked off into the night.  We pulled out and made a b-line for the closest fast food parking lot so we could finally get well.  

After we had both done our shots and lit the last two cigarettes we had saved, I looked over at Cory and said, “Gotta give you credit where credit is due, you came through clutch bro, that was tight.  You got his number, right?”

“Uhh……”

It explains why I didn’t get as high as I intended the day before , because the handful I had and smashed into my open mouth must of missed 3 and I didn’t even notice.

Well fuck me im in a bit of a pickle, I really want to take those Oxys but fuck, I got suboxone dissolving in my mouth..

Me being super impatient and spastic, I say, You know what fuck it I’ll just snort a 60mg like and enjoy the 10 minute short buzz I might get from it .

So away I go, snort a big fat line and all of a sudden the taste of the oxy combined with the suboxone and instantly I wanna throw up. I try my best to let it all sit there and resist but the urge is too strong

Boom. The most vomit I have ever ever vomited in my whole life. All my drugs most likely gone although as I’m typing this I have a slight buzz. Not sure from what.

Well my girl was pregnant so I didn't want to lose the damn money so I took the transfer 

Been here 6 months and I literally couldn't find a damn thing .. Fucking nothing .. it's not like I can go out to bars and Shit because ya know the whole family life. 

The one place I do go every Week is the barber shop .. now where I'm from I have never seen a girl barber but here the shop close to my house is all girls. 

The last couple months I have been seeing the same girl every Friday .. she's like 38 .. lots of tattooes .. really pale .. totally sexy in my book .. it started off her starting to bitch about her husband and talk about how he always cheats and shit like that bla bla bla .. she has been hitting on me quite a bit recently. 

Today after work I smoked with a guy I work with .. smelled a little skunky when I went in there .. she mentions something about liking to smoke weed ... I said meh it's all right not really my favorite thing though. After some talking and what not about that type of shit she said she can score me some vicodin 750s for 6 bucks a piece .. I told her I would take 25 of them. 

Ran to the ATM and pulled her out 150$ and I let my money walk .. she said I could go with her but I had to beat my wife home so it wasn't an option. 

So I broke one of the cardinal sins but after 6 months of nothing but a little weed and some beer ... thankfully there's good ass craft beer here in the Midwest though .. but anyways at this point I figured fuck it anythings worth a shot. 

Hopefully I'll have good news tomorrow .. I just want to play some fucking switch while being warm and fuzzy. ",1521160616.0

I've woken up feeling okay and ready for the day for the first time in years.

Pills cross my mind but the thought leaves and quickly as it comes. 

I'm wondering about a few side effects, and a few other thoughts I've been having. 

-Mad dehydration. I already drink a gallon a day and it's never enough. My face is HOT all the time and I'm constantly flushed red. Tolerable, just wondering if common. 

-Constant headache. Easily managed with ibuprofen, but even then it is always there. 

-Constipation. Although just recently got some relief after TWO WEEKS of no BM. I took 6 oz. of Milk of Magnesia. After 6 hours, still nothing so I decided to get up and moving to see if it helped. Went to plug the vacuum in, shocked myself and subsequently shit my pants. My insides have been liquefied but it is strangely relieving and cleansing. TMI, sorry dudes. 

-I feel like 4 mg is doing the trick. I have a good amount of energy and lesser side effects at this dose. My Dr. has told me to stay at the prescribed dose, but I'd personally like to take just the 4 mg and squirrel away the rest. Opinions? 

I am having a complete hysterectomy (very uncommon for age 25) on Tuesday, my sub doctor has given me the okay to stop the subs tomorrow and take Percocet as prescribed following the surgery. We'll see how it goes.

I feel like it’s the most practical way, painless way. I would just worry about it not killing me, and just becoming terribly disabled after. I would want it to be on the side of the parkway because I love my car and would want to die in my car.

Don't have much opi tolerance atm but used to fuck with heroin and acetyl fentanyl so I feel like my tolerance has risen more quickly than it should have

Looking for answers,"Alrighty, I made an account just to post here. I've been using black tar since late 2015 off and on. Lately I feel like I don't shoot black as often as I once did back in my hay day. Often I get this 'China white' and I don't shoot, I smoke it. I have self control when it comes to black because it doesn't feel as good as it used to back in 2016. But I keep going on these benders with the white.
Anyway, it had been 2 days since I had any. I got some yesterday and I went overboard. Kept smoking little bits throughout the day, until evening. I took a break for about 2 hrs and decide to smoke 2 small bits to end my night. Well, 15 min later my blood pressure shot up to 195/90 or something to that effect. I freaked out. I've been taking vitamin supplements (fish oil, daily multi and garlic pills) and I took an Advil when I saw my numbers. I went walking for 10 min trying to bring my pressure back down. I felt like it wasn't working. The soonest chance I had, I rushed to emergency with my own blood pressure machine. Took about 20 min. When I got there, I went to check my pressure again. It finally came back down to 146/something. I finally relaxed, waited and went home without checking in. 
Does your blood pressure get dangerously high with black or white? I'm trying hard not to risk doing this drug anymore but you know how that goes. I wanna test it, try a tiny bit today. But it could be the end for me. I'm just looking for ideas",1521139005.0

I've made art pieces for friends of mine in exchange for the amount of powder it took to make the piece.

Me and a friend of mine (he's a peasant without a reddit account) have been debating putting on an art show at a local bar. They don't really give a shit that it's dope foils, and we would obviously use aliases and have someone who doesn't use/didn't participate in the purchase, usage or possession of any narcotics or paraphernalia, and was not present for the creation of the pieces represent us at the first night of the show (essentially this bar hangs new art every first friday and it stays up all month, but they do the ""unveiling"" party on first friday), and collect all the money from the sales.
 
My questions to you guys are:

How interested would you be in purchasing foil art? each part of the design is on a 3 inch x 3 inch foil and costs $25 to make. for example; my  piece titled ""Sorry Dad"" has 8 parts and cost $200 to make minus the time, the foil, the footer and the lighter.

this leads into my second question, how should I go about pricing these things? should I stick to charging what the dope cost me? Keep in mind, I also get high while making them, so the supply cost isn't a total loss.

Let me know what you think!!!

Two days and two hospital visits later, I finally crack. I convince my doc to write me another oxy script, bamboozling him with a story about my pills being confiscated in customs.

My question is, considering the length I've been on subs for and the dose I've been taking, is it likely ill experience any major withdrawal or should the half-life of this medication carry me pretty close to my next appointment? if its a day or two I don't mind, but I can't sit around in WD for 5 days prior to my appointment because fuck that. My last dose (I take at night because I feel exhausted if I take in the morning) was last night around 8PM.

D was a kind of goofy dboy and the image forever imprinted in my brain is these oversized square shape diamond (or most likely diamond look a like) earrings he always wore. He worked for a player who went by a large two letter USA city and around this time (summer of 16) a certain notoriously nasty Midwest city had this blue dope going around.  We called it blue smurf and for anyone else whos in the know and experience the smurf, you know it was the bomb for a minute in town. Promptly ripped off in the weeks do follow but the business for a bit.  Happy thoughts to happy nods passed.  Anyways so if you hit up Mr XX city and you got him or his partner who another two letter moniker this time ripped off from a rapper,  you were golden.  Fat sack, not a super sketch spot (all things considered where we were), and fairly prompt.  But if you were dealt by Big earring B you were likely sitting at a populated bus stop in no synch with the routes waiting for a less than fat bag of dope. But for the smurf it was worth the gamble.  AnywYs to cut to the chase B gets in my car and I'm getting three 20s he plops two in my hand I remind him I need one more and he goes for another bag but fumbles that little blue bitch and pink,  plank,  plop,  right into the crack under my emergency brake.  I say ""ah Yo!"" and he kinda shrugs says you'll find it and bounces from my car. Of course my ass gets high on the 2 bags I don't have to go mining my car for first,  and latter in the day do a number on the plastic housing around my gear shift with a screw driver.  No dope.  Fuck.... But I'm high and I get high for a succession afterwards and by the time I'm at a point where I'm desperately sick without end insight I've forgotten about the bastard. Lotta things going on back then Lotta drugs easier to forget then you might imagine.  Anyways one night months latter I'm talking months I'm sick and all of a sudden I remember there's a bag of smurf in my car. Gotta be where could it have gone right.  Cut the floor lining under both my seats and found that motjerfucker hiding under the carpet that lined underneath my passenger! Fucking SCORE!

Hopefully it wasn’t a fluke and you guys enjoy this one too.","I put the car in park and peered around at my surroundings. I’d driven to a brick and wood panel house, one of those houses that was obviously designed and built in the 70s. It lay under an ancient oak tree, it’s long and twisted branches reaching out over the house and front yard with their shadows giving a false sense of comfort in the midday heat. One fallen branch would easily destroy the house. A rough looking dog house was nestled at the base of the tree housing an equally rough looking mangy Siberian husky. 

The husky was not the only animal I saw. In fact, the yard was infested with pets and strays alike. The house sat down the road from a low income trailer park, where parents would gift puppies to their children, not understanding how much dedication and money raising a dog truly takes. Some of these neglected and forgotten pets inevitably migrated to this house, where the owner set out food every day for all of the unwanted dogs as well as her pets. 

I turned off the ignition and opened my door, stepping out into the sweltering Mississippi summer heat. The smell of dog feces immediately met my nostrils. I stared at my feet as I cautiously made my way to the front door, stepping carefully to avoid the numerous mounds of shit. The smell of extreme neglect joined the smell of feces once I reached the front door. A pungent potpourri of waste and decay. 

Knock knock, shuffling inside, then an open door. The smell of urine joining the fecal rot. Standing before me was a nice enough older lady. She was extremely sweet, to the point it sometimes felt disingenuous. She wore a purple sweatsuit despite the heat, stained with sweat and food and dirt (I hoped it was dirt, at least.). Slightly overweight, her jowls had a habit of jiggling violently when she spoke. I always found myself focusing on it while listening to her speak and there was no change to this routine as she said “hello.” 

“Hey Miss Paula, how are you doing? Hiding from this heat?” I asked. 

“Oh ya know, I’m just makin’ it. Scrappy, hush!” A small dog was yapping at me from between her feet. I never found out the breed, probably a mutt, but it was a dog I classified as an “ankle biter.” The words of Ron Swanson snuck into my thoughts...”any dog under 50 pounds is a cat and cats are pointless.” My mind had a habit of drifting to some pop culture reference that few people ever got when I’d speak them aloud. “Why don’t ya come on inside with the AC. You look like you’re burnin’ up.” Her southern accent was as thick as the humidity. 

She stepped to the side and held open the door as I passed the threshold. The aroma outside was undeniably bad but it simply did not compare to the wall of stink that crashed into my face as I entered. The house was a mess in every sense of the word. Hell, “mess” was an extreme understatement. The living room furniture, if the room even actually contained any furniture, was piled with laundry and trash to the point of invisibility. I could see in some spots that the floor was originally white, but most of it now was piss yellow. More dogs began barking at me as Scrappy nipped at my heals. The inside of the house told a tale of a lonely woman, one who’s children no longer came around and a husband long gone. A tale of a woman who cared more for the stray dogs she took care of more than she cared for herself. A tale of a woman that hoarded useless things to try and fill a hole left in her life after raising her family. Not caring about ourselves was one of the few things Miss Paula and I had in common. “Sorry about the mess, she apologized.” 

“Oh it’s fine, I hardly noticed,” I lied as I searched for a decent place to lean my aching body against.

“So...how’s your momma?” The beginning of a barrage of questions I couldn’t care less to answer. A pointless formality to maintain the facade of southern hospitality. I answered each one respectfully, patiently waiting for us to arrive to the point of my visit. “...and those damned doctors have found more junk supposedly wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like they’re just yankin’ my chain for insurance money, I swear.” Miss Paula was riddled with medical issues. Thinking about how little time she had remaining would give me an existential crisis.

“Yeah I can’t imagine what you’re going through. It’s obviously tough,” I replied, wondering if she ever noticed how captivated I was by her chubby, rippling cheeks. Maybe I focused on them so as not to become overwhelmed by the putrid stink of this house and thoughts of death. 

“Yeah it’s tough, but The Lord will guide me through it. I have no doubt about that.” I couldn’t help but wonder why a loving god would put his creation through such pain. “Anyway, how many did you say you wanted again?” 

Finally, to the fucking point. “Well, I have like $120 so I guess 12? If you can spare them.” Pointless politeness. Of course this unemployable lady living in squalor would sell me her morphine pills. My habit bought her groceries every week. 

“The doctor gave me some new ones this last time. These are 60 milligrams instead of 30. I don’t know how much these usually go for...”

“Well I guess it makes sense to double the price for double the milligram, you think?” I asked. The price was fair. (Some of you will doubt this, but heroin was non existent in my area so pain pills were relatively cheap. No ‘dollar a mg’ bullshit, here) I was a junkie with a serious habit, but I couldn’t bring myself to be dishonest to this poor lady. The least I could do was pay her right. 

“You sure that ain’t too much? That’s an awful lot...are these really worth $20? I don’t think I’d pay that but I sure am thankful you know people that do.” She punctuated her statement with a hearty laugh. “So it’ll be 6 then, right?” 

“Yup, 6.” I replied anxiously. I was giddy with the anticipation of getting back to my car with the pills. I was on the third day of withdrawal and had been waiting on “refill day” all week. Miss Paula poured 8 little white ovals into my outstretched palm. 

“Here’s two extra for you sellin’ ‘em for me. I know you wouldn’t tell me but I bet it’s a lotta trouble findin’ people to pay $10 or $20 a pill.” Miss Paula believed that I was an innocent college kid just helping a poor old lady make some money. She had no idea I’d be cooking two of these pills in her driveway five minutes from now, shielded from her view by a large holly bush. 

“Thank you, it’s not a big deal. They’re easy to sell, especially at school, ya know. Those kids would rather buy drugs than food.” I joked, Miss Paula unaware of that jab I was making at myself. I’d chose to buy her groceries instead of my own. 

“Well, I sure do appreciate it. You be safe now, ya hear? You want a coke or somethin’?” I said sure and she moseyed over to her filthy fridge, stepping barefoot into puddles of lukewarm dog piss. She came back with a Dr. Pepper... Southerners called any soda “coke.” I thanked her and walked outside, trying not to sprint to my car door and thankful for the shit-smelling air in comparison to the pungent mess that was the inside of Paula’s house. 

I sat in my driver’s seat, shut the door, and reversed down the driveway past the holly bush near the old country road, stopping once I was sure the nose of my car wasn’t visible from Miss Paula’s front door. I was acutely feeling every symptom of my withdrawals... it always seems to get worse when you know you’re just a few steps from getting better. My AC was off despite the sweltering heat, amplified by my closed car windows. An ant trapped under the magnified beam of sunlight aimed by an uncaring bully of a god. I opened my center console, gathered my supplies, and began to work. 

First, you had to wipe the coating off the pills. Sometimes I would skip this step out of impatience, but that day I methodically smeared every bit of white off both of the pills I selected. With both pills free of their coating, I dropped them in my spoon. The amount of water one needs to successfully make a solution of morphine from a pill depends on a few things... the brand of the pill (different brands require different steps to break down), the depth of the spoon (a deep spoon wouldn’t evaporate water as quickly as a shallow one), the strength of your source of heat (the weak flame of a Bic, the red hot heat of an oven eye). I had a fairly deep spoon that I’d shoplifted (how pathetic is it to shoplift a .99 cent spoon?) and one of those small torches sold at convenience stores, so I didn’t require much water. Torches have the added benefit of not leaving behind any smut. A “good rule of thumb” (a phrase with extremely fucked origins, by the way) I used was “one syringe cap (the cap protecting the plunger on diabetic needles) per pill.” I dumped the water in the spoon and put the torch to its bottom. 

Breaking down pills isn’t like fixing a shot of heroin. It takes a bit of time. I sat there for about a minute, waiting for the water to boil and trying to ignore the school bus coming up the street. The pills swelled and I smashed them into the water as the bus dropped my niece off a few houses down, oblivious to her uncle preparing a shot within eyesight. With each smash, a white cloud spread out from the round edge of the plunger until nothing was left of the pills but two oval husks with a faint “60” imprint. I dropped a piece of balled up cotton into the water and drew up exactly 100 units of solution. I’d done this so often that I filled the syringe completely the first try, using just the right amount of water. My deviant chemistry lab experiment was complete. If only I did that well in my actual chemistry class. Oh well, time to get well. 

I was drenched in sweat and my veins were popping. I didn’t even need to tie off. The needle tore a hole through the top of my hand and I began to dig under my flesh in search of a vein. After a few seconds, I felt the familiar “pop” as the vein gave up its flight from the needle, bouncing back into place as I pushed the needle deeper into the vein, insuring it didn’t pop back out. I pulled the plunger back, mesmerized by the majestic swirl of blood shooting into the morphine solution...I always appreciated that part of the ritual the most. I pushed the plunger all the way in until it expelled a sucking sound as the last bit of solution entered my circulatory system. I pulled the needle out, placed a thumb on the wound to mitigate bruising, sat back, and waited. 

Morphine sneaks up on you just like heroin (I feel like I need to explain because I know most people here shoot heroin). In my experience, just as I become disappointed in how “good” my shot was, it creeps up on me. That day was no different. Being 3 days into withdrawal, the shot showed me no mercy. It started with a sensation I can only describe as “needles in your teeth.” It was so strong that it felt like my head would shatter, each tooth exploding like a kernel of popcorn in response to the heat swelling in my chest. The familiar sinking feeling reached my legs and stomach, as if a force were pulling me by an invisible rope through the bottom of my car. It felt like I gained 200 pounds in seconds. The pins and needles spread to the rest of my body, pricking and prodding in an unexpectedly pleasant way. Twenty seconds in, the rush continued to become more intense. My head drooped as a black shadow formed around my vision. The thought of me overdosing crossed my mind, though I wasn’t sure if it was actually happening. I imagined my innocent niece seeing my car from her house, walking over excitedly and discovering her selfish uncle cold and blue and covered in vomit. Her innocence ruined, the image of my corpse forever seared into her memory. I fought the shadows back...huddles of demonic beings retreating from the light. I couldn’t let myself overdose there. 

The rush finally let up. My heart was pounding into my skull, skin beat read and hot as if I had an extreme fever. I felt a mild headache forming in my temples. The lingering memory of the pins and needles creating an unbearable itch in my feet. Yet I was alive and I was well, the beast of opiate withdrawal temporarily placated yet again. I sat there for a moment, trying to erase the image of my imagined death and discovery. Eventually I started the ignition and drove to my sisters house.

My niece greeted me at the back door of my sister’s house. It opened into their kitchen and she was preparing an after school snack. A pang of guilt shot through my body. 

“Hey, how was school? I was just driving by and figured I’d come say ‘hey’. Do you wanna go play Minecraft?” Like any elementary aged child at the time, she was absolutely obsessed with the game. She said yes and I followed her to the living room, waving to my sister as I walked. My niece sat cross legged in the floor and I joined her in front of the TV, picking up a controller.

“Hey Uncle, what’s that? Did you get hurt?” My niece asked as I crossed my legs. She was pointing to my hand. 

I looked down and saw a streak of blood left over from my shot, another pang of guilt shooting through out my body. “Oh, I don’t know what that is. I must have gotten bit by a mosquito.” 

At least I wouldn’t have to live with such guilt if I had overdosed, I selfishly thought. ",1521103003.0

Anyway, today, you turned yourself into police for an outstanding warrant you had. I know you're going to suffer some really hardcore withdrawals, and it's going to fucking suck ass. Guess what though? I'll be writing you soon. I'll send you mail, might even throw some money on your commissary.

It's scary going to jail. It's TERRIFYING to withdraw in jail. I hope all goes well for you. I hope you get out sooner than later, but we don't know. & for the record, I don't think you're an awful person. I think drugs just fuck us all up. 

Even me, they even fucked me up too. I'm hoping for nothing but the best for you.

Even though you can't see this I want to send you warm hugs, well wishes, and lotsa love.  What you did today was super ballsy.
