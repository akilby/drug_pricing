I have a bottle of Norcos (10/325). When I first started (once or twice a month) I did about 3 at once and would have a great time. That progressed in dosages and frequency and about 1-2 months in, just last week I've started 5 at once and 3 days in a row. I thought that was still okay since I was under the maximum dosages before I'd have to CWE (Hard to be discrete smashing pills with roommates). But when the effects are at it's plateau or so, I got very sick and nauseous and threw up at lot and turned red and itchy (More like an allergic itchy than opiate because this is a dose I've had before and did not have nearly the same effect). I also couldn't eat. Should I be worried about my liver? I'm 115 pounds... Even though it's much less than the max tylenol dose, is it still too much? Thank you for helping me be safe guys...

I had to return home for serious family business. I moved out of state to cut ties with all my hookups. Well I'm back. Dealers have better prices and shit is everywhere (hence why all the recent pill porn).

Anyway, shit has been terrible for my mother ( step father for 18 years up and left). I came back for her. I'm using again, and I'm terribly depressed. Very scary for me, seeing as I have an endless supply of oxy and xanax. I can literally reach in my night stand and pull out grams of oxy and xanax (30mg and 1mg respectively)

I have no one to talk to, as I weeded out friends cause I moved in Nov.  I've been eating the fuck out of footballs and must have snorted 34 30s today.  I don't know how to cope. This isn't a woe is me post, I just literally have no one but my mother to reach out to.

Now I'm at the point of barely feeling 100mg hydro (last thing I took), and this seems to be a PERMANENT tolerance. About a month ago I OD'd on fentanyl. I had read all the forum posts about peoples' friends dying, only smoke a BB size amount of fent, etc. but after a while of using considerable amounts of fentanyl and nothing going awry I started to get into the mind set that I was ""above"" that danger. Then I went to hang with my girlfriend a couple of hours away, rubbed some gel from a 75mcg patch on my gums and went to lunch. After lunch, girlfriend went to the bathroom for a sec, I pulled the remaining patch from my pocket, couldn't find any scissors in my car and determined that I had taken enough of the gel so that sucking on the last of the patch would be safe. I was wrong. I remember nodding out BAD while she was driving from the restaurant, saying we should go home for a nap, then BOOM woke up in the ambulance. It was the most terrifying fucking experience of my life, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. Having paramedics screaming ""WHAT DID YOU TAKE? WHAT DID YOU TAKE MAN? IF YOU ANSWER IT'LL SAVE US A LOT OF TIME"" and then, after halfway realizing where the fuck I am gaining the composure to barely mutter the word ""fentanyl!, I took some fentanyl!"". I later learned that I passed out in the passengers seat, started convulsing, my girlfriend called 911 and when asked if I used drugs she replied ""he smoked weed a couple of years ago."" Needless to say I'd been keeping some secrets from her, among many others. Had I not been able to miraculously tell them I had taken an opiate (which prompted them to administer Narcan), I wouldn't be here right now.

(hopefully my final update about this fucktard),"alright you may remember the stories i posted last week about the [guy that overdosed in my bedroom](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1gzrcv/some_dumb_shit_just_overdosed_in_my_bedroom/) who i sort of accidentally but not really accidentally [ripped off](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1h9w4p/stupid_stupid_stupid/) the next day along with making a shit ton of stupid mistakes.

So i subscribe to a group on facebook that posts the mugshots of all the arrests in the tri-county i live in(you know where this is going).  and about 30 minutes ago i see dude's face posted up.  Apparently he got picked up for shoplifting and has a ""no bail"" thing next to the charge.  i'm assuming he had warrants.  so yea.  that guy is really having an awful week i guess.  overdosed, got ripped off by my dumbass, then gets picked up for shoplifting.  i almost feel bad for him.

so hopefully this will be the last i hear from/about that asshat.  anways after all that shit went down last week i decided to/was forced to (for the greater good imo) stop doing dope.  my connects were all arrested, pissed as fuck at me, or i lost their numbers when i idiotically handed my phone over as collateral to winner of the best week ever.  so it's been a week since i've done any heroin!  i'm pretty proud of myself.  i have been doing pieces of sub strips here and there.  not quite everyday.  between saturday night and this morning i didn't do any opiates at all.  didn't get too sick.  mostly just couldn't sleep.  so yea, there's that.  but hopefully i will be posting a picture of some fine ass BTH that i'm expecting from SR tomorrow.  i am like a kid on christmas eve right now.  

dealing with all this craziness and my own stupidity was a pretty big wake up call for me.  i was a good chipper for a few years after i stopped going to the methadone clinic but between october and now i have gotten out of control.  thankfully i have an amazing girlfriend supporting me every step of the way and a great sub connect to make sure i'm not in too much discomfort.  

tl;dr - this dude overdosed in my house, then i sort of accidentally ripped him off the next day, a week later he gets arrested for shoplifting.  what a shitty week.  also the events forced/inspired me to get cleaner than i've been in close to a year.",1372820085.0

After an hour my muscles all started aching and I had to lay down, it felt like I had run a marathon the day before, it was verging on painful. Now 8 hours later I feel a bit nauseous and dizzy. So I was wondering why I reacted this way? 

Google says it could be hyperalgesia (increased sensitivity to pain from the morphine) or an overdose or cancer haha. Or maybe I got screwed over and the pill wasn't actually morphine? I divided a 100mg pill and it looks normal.

(This is probably a stupid q but I'm feeling pretty sick and google is very contradictory)

IDK, help my nervous ass out guys.

i've done a lot of opiates, but not usually more than once or twice a week. after a long break I did one roxy per day, for four days, with two days break inbetween. i found on those break days that i felt kind of like i was coming down with something. like i had a lump in my throat and a lot of mucous. but nothing otherwise.

yesterday (the last day of the four using days), i started feeling really nauseous and just ""off"" about halfway through the day. did some oxy, i could still notice the symptoms for awhile and then they went away.

today i have the same symptoms. they came on kind of spontaneously. got weirdly moody, then nauseous, and i have this uncomfortable ""off"" feeling that i can only describe as the opposite of an opiate high. it's like an uncomfortable crawly kind of feeling on my skin. 

what doesn't make sense to me is that i don't have a lot of symptoms that most people do during WD's (no sweats, runny nose, diarrhea, muscle pain, etc.) and like...it's four days. i've never heard of anyone getting WD's from only doing opiates for four days.

i heard that people can get WD's really quickly if they've had WD before. i *think* i had a day of withdrawal once before: would that count? I was popping pills on and off for a week or week and a half and i had one long, miserable day of this ""uncomfortable"" feeling but it was really overwhelming and i basically couldn't do anything. generally felt awful. everything made me feel miserable. no nausea or other symptoms. i'm not 100% that this was even WD, but I'm just throwing it out there. 

i know this is probably nothing compared to what a lot of you guys go through so i feel kind of dumb for even posting this, but if it's my first time i don't know what the fuck to do. how long is this going to last after only 4 days of use, if it is WD's? i'm going on a trip in a few days and the people i'll be with have no idea of my ""hobby"" so it's going to suck on many levels if I'm obviously WD'ing. 

it's also kind of hard to concentrate. ",1372803843.0

So anyway here i am back in rehab, this time i know i need to get in a long term program afterwards not go back to my apartment. Well after a week you sitdown in front of your treatment team and discuss your plans. i sit down and immediately put it on the table that i need to get in one of the 2 on campus programs when i finish rehab. i am shot down, you have to be homeless to get into their programs and even though there is an eviction notice on my door, that isn't good enough. ok, so backup plan, i let my team know i need to get on sub maintenance. BANG shot down again. because of the eviction notice, my housing is not stable enough to be in their maintenance program. So I'm pretty pissed at this point, i bring up another issue, my medication. i put it to them like this my medications are not helping me, in fact they may as well be sugar pills for all the good they are doing me. i explain that all mydiagnoses say that my drug use is due to these mental illnesses that i am dealing with, and if i leave here without an effective medication regimen then my chances of staying clean are very slim. they say i may be able to talk to a psyche dr in 2 weeks. quick math, a week into a 21 day program and you are told you might see a dr in 2 weeks. hmmm so basically I'm not gonna get to see a dr. so i look at this treatment team meeting as them not trying to help me. so i make up my mind that i am leaving, binging for a week or so and hopping on an amtrak to california and ill see what the veterans hospitals out there can do for me. so i leave with another patient. he's from camden but was staying in a shelter before he went to rehab. so we stop in camden grab some D and he grabs his DOC, crack and head to my place in delaware. we get fucked up for 2 days, at some point i buy a amtrak ticket. and he leaves and heads back to the shelter he was staying at. the day after he leaves i get a call from him, he asks me if I'm home, no but i will be in less than an hour, he explains some guys from hbo want to talk, they are doing a documentary on veterans dealing with addiction and are willing to pay just to talk. i kinda don't believe him so i tell him ill give him a call when i get home. 2 hours later he calls, he's outside with this hbo guy. so i think wow maybe this is for real. we get high and talk for 2-3 hours. hbo dude buys dinner and pays me 80 bucks. at the end of the night the hbo guy tells me he really likes my story and would it be ok to bring a film crew and would i be ok talking about my use on camera. I tell him that i am cool with it but like i told him earlier I'm going to cali in 5 days. he says they can probably get the crew down tomorrow or the day after. i tell him cool we talk money and that's that. the next day the film crew comes down me and my rehab buddy talk about combat, drugs, dealing with the veterans healthcare system, and a bunch of everyday shit.  at the end of filming we grab a bite to eat and the hbo dude says he thinks my story is really cool and would it be ok to come on the train and film my journey, i tell him no problem, we talk money and that's that.

the day comes when its time to get on the train. I'm well stocked with enough oxymorphone to last 5 days and 4 bundles of dope. of course i run out of pills in a day and a half. so i go on an adventure to the westside during a layover in chicago. it works out and i have enough to get to cali comfortably. everything goes pretty good, we do little check ins on camera, where we are, how I'm feeling etc. when we get to cali I'm out of dope withdrawals start kicking in. hbo dude films it. he has a rented car at the hotel we are at. i beg him to take me down to skid row to find something. he tells me to stick to the plan and not to make any contacts out there. he's a good dude tries to distract me and promises to get me to the va first thing in the AM. the next morning i head over to the va hospital and am admitted.


I detox at the VA and tbe wds are not bad at all compared to past experiences. time comes to figure out where to go from her. apparently they don't have an inpatient VA dehab out here. they refer me to a rehab ran by salvation army, doesn't sound half bad. until i talk to another patient who just got back from there. he tells me there is a lot of drug use there. the facility is a converted warehouse, and sleeping quarters are cubicled off but he says it is loud at night which is a big problem for me. i have terrible nightmarea and rarely get more than 4 hours of sleep. i express my concerns with staff at the detox and they assure me it'll be ok, give it a try, knowing that beggars cannot be choosers i head over to the program. my first night i spend in the shelter half. the facility has a shelter and a rehab unbeknownest to me. so day 2 i start going to groups. not too bad although i didn't sleep much my first night. I was told hygeine items were provided, they weren't. i didn't. even have a towel. luckily i stole sheets and a blanket from someone's bed. it was very unorganized and no one told me the rules or anything. day 3 i had a drs appt so when i heard the intercom call for anyone going to the va to be outside at 7am i headed outside and rode the bus the 2 houRs to the va. my appt was a simple mental health checkin after leaving the detox. The social worker whom i was speaking with was worried as i apparently looked like i was losing it. so he had me talk to a psyche who wanted to give me klonipin but upon investigation it wasn't allowed at the rehab so he prescribed a high dose gabapentin and penciled me in for the next day. i headed to the pharmacy and picked em up and went to wait for the bus. i get back and hit the last few groups. day 4 again didn't sleep much and the gabapentin doesnt seem to help. around 645 i head out to wait on the bus, but am called back in. i go see what's up. i get bitched at for not seeing some lady to do an intake. no one told me anything about this so she tells me we'll do it now i tell her i gotta take the bus. she tells me i can take a city bus, i ask her for bus tokens, they don't have any so angerily she tells me to go. fast forward to day 5 i again have an appointment this secretary lady again bitches at me, tells me i should have taken care of this before i got there. she asks me about any other appts i tell her about my monday and tuesday appts and she flips. Tells me to pack my stuff. so i do and head back to the VA, they talk to the program director and he says to come back. this is the first communication i see between the program and the VA even though i was assured that they talk to the va ans will make sure i make all appts. whatever. so i head back that evening. i guess fridays are when they party cuz i notive someone shooting up in a stall, and another person smoking crack out back. weekends are dull. i get reprimanded for going to the store to get cigs, you can't go off grounds your first month there, of course no one told me this. monday finally rolls around and the same lady bitches at me again for not doing my intake. i brush her off and head to my appt which is a dental appt. They script me vicodin 5s. my tooth is hurting bad but i make sure to only take them exactly as prescribed. On tuesday i see my friend the intake lady she again bitches at me. i tell her about what i was scripted and she gets pissed, apparently you are not allowed to hold your own meds. i am booted from the program bc i had my scripts in my locker. 

I go to the VA with my bags and they send me to another program which promptly boots me for having dirty urine (you are supposed to detox before going to their program.) at this point I'm fed up. fuck it, i relapse hard, shooting mscontins andw hotel hop for a week before amtraking it back east and staying with a friend until i got back out on my own.


This whole journey sucked. only upside is that the hbo guys, they work for a little company called vice and they recently got a show on hbo. so keep your eyes open for me. i should be in the second season. last time i talked to them asking what was going on with my episode and they were still trying to get someone from the VA to talk on camera about my specific experience. but this has been a long not too eventful post but hopefully anyone who read this will be looking for me.",1372917768.0
1hma90,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1hma90/not_to_be_a_downer/,52,https://redd.it/1hma90,dopef123,Not to be a downer,"I got addicted to opiates about a year ago. Iv'ed heroin for about 4 months straight. I've been clean for a little over a month. It's such a good fucking feeling. I still have to wear makeup to cover my tracks but I think in a month or two I'll be good to go.

I realized one day that opiates made life amazing for the short-term but fucked you over in the long run. Since quitting I got a high paying job, a girlfriend (after having absolutely no luck with women until my mid 20's), and am the happiest I've ever been. I used to post here a lot and I know you guys don't want to hear this shit... but you're at best wasting your time.. at worst you're dying for a chemical. Just think about it. 

Honestly I think doing heroin made me a better person in some fucked up way. It really made me appreciate not being sick and being able to have some sort of savings. I'm way happier after kicking the habit than I've been in my entire life. 

I romanticized it for a while thinking I was a character in train spotting or Stza from Leftover Crack. I got some good stories out of it, but I can't share them with anyone because of the stigma attached with heroin. 

I guess I wrote this to really cement in the fact that I'm done with heroin. I hope I didn't make any of you feel bad or anything. If you want to keep doing heroin then I will continue fighting for you and needle exchange programs because I think they are important. But remember no junkie who cleaned up their act looks back at their addiction as a fun time. There is some SERIOUS cognitive dissonance that goes on with this drug. It's a real mind fuck and you're brain legitimately gets taken over by a random chemical. 

Maybe I wasn't as deep as some of you but I'm a month clean and have no cravings after using for about half a year off and on with 3 months IV no breaks. If I can do it you can do it. You just have to replace heroin with something else. I replaced it with my health and happiness. Heroin gave me neither in the long run. It felt amazing to shoot up, but there was a lot of other dark shit that went with it. Like how did I end up here? Am I going to be ok? Does my family know? Questions I never want to ask myself again.

I'm sure it was easier for me than many people. My family (maybe they did?) didn't know. I got an engineering degree from a top school, and I had a lot of shit going for me. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just being honest. I'm sure many of you don't think you have much to look forward to in life... but you can honestly go anywhere you want. So many options, especially if you're in the West. You could all replace heroin with something bigger that'll make you happy for decades. It'll be hard but I guarantee it'll pay off. You just need to concentrate as hard if not harder on your goals than you did on scoring. Induce that sick/withdrawal feeling when you become weak willed. No one remembers the weak.

So goodluck. Have fun. And goodbye.",1372917047.0

After some time on my own I was in a bad place so I came home and asked them to help me. They let me move back in on the condition that I quit H and get the vivitrol shot. I WD'ed at home, and was clean for over a week.

Then today I fucked up and used again. The problem is that the appointment with the doctor for the vivitrol shot is Friday morning. I'm pretty sure that they drug test you before they give the shot because of possible precipitated withdrawals. If they do, then my parents will find out that I used. I can't have them find out, this was my last chance. If they find out they will kick me out indefinitely, and I don't have anywhere else to go. 

Am I completely fucked, or is there a way around this? I've never gotten the shot before so I don't know how this all works. Do they drug test you? Can the doctor tell my parents that I failed the test? I know there is patient confidentiality and all that, but they are paying for the visit. Is there a way that I can move this appointment without looking too suspicious? Or is there a valid excuse for a false positive? Sorry if these questions are stupid, I'm panicking about this.

I'll try to keep this short, and leave out all the philosophy and the whys.


I started smoking when i was 15, and using opiates around the same time. After five years of smoking weed erryday and chipping, i succumbed to addiction. I had a reasonable sized savings. So for an entire summer and winter I was noddin my ass off on that sweet ass chicago #4. This time is mostly a blur of trying to detox, making trips to illinois, sitting outside smoking/nodding for an hour at a time, and spending all my goddamn money. Eventually in the spring time, i managed to deplete my savings and even the secret stashes of my parents. Between paychecks i would get sick, and eventually i quit my job (pulled a no call no show during wds).

This is when things started getting rough for me, most of the time i'd wake up sick and start scheming to get high. I moved out of my moms to use freely and privately. I felt like a fucking con artist, pulling 60 to 240 dollars out of my ass every day. One day my friend od'd on the car ride home from picking up. Foolishly he snorted 1.5 times as much as i would shoot (my tolerance required me to inject a quarter gram at the time to feel anything). When i couldnt rouse him in the vehicle i called for help. Of fucking course when we arrived at my moms house he woke up. I was pissed that the ambulance was already on their way but glad he was alive. This is when i got my liscense suspended and decided to get on suboxone. I took it as prescribed for about a week and then started selling it. When i couldnt rip someone off, all i had to do was sell enough for a g and id be good for the day. About two months later i started pulling money off my moms atm card. It took hundreds of dollars but eventually i got the card taken away and to save face i went to detox. The day i was released, i called my girl for a ride home and of course we went straight down to cop. I pretended i was clean but could only support my addiction for a month or two on my own.

Things got really bumpy when we got evicted from our low income housing (landlord paid us due to 0 income). I lived in a campground for a week even though i could've moved back home. I still had the family car and a few good junkie friends to combine resources with. When that was over i pulled one last scheme, i stole the atm card and pulled 120 off of it. Before i went to cop i sold some bunk acid for another 120 (pennies compared to the grand or two i made off of that blank sheet that week). I made my last trip to illinois, got 2 gs, and nodded for the first time in weeks. I returned to town with my secret stash to a sick girlfriend and a bunch of cops waiting at the motel to take my moms car back. I had burned all bridges with my family and every non-user i knew in that town.

With no car, no home, no resources, and just enough money for a train ticket; i skipped town with my girlfriend and made it to her aunts house in ohio. They helped us detox and we planned on moving to north carolina together with her other aunt. Things changed when she was caught stealing benzos, she was removed from the home and taken to a hotel. I did not accompany her because secretly i hadnt wanted to be with her for months. When she realized i wasnt coming to the hotel she walked back to her aunts house and was arrested for trespassing. The family was suddenly mine, i was inducted as the new nephew, and taken down to north carolina to start a new life.

So here i sit, 20 days without a connect, in this humid ass state. I work with boat upholstery and now that i have money all i want is to go back to wisco and get high! Sorry this is so long, but ive had an interesting year and it didnt seem right to paraphrase too much.",1372984863.0

My one homie pukes so much. Once we smoked some heroin at my house before going to the airport for a flight to Mexico.
He was going to the bathroom to puke every ten minutes in the airport.

I remember a few other times his night was ruined when he did a line of H because he just started to puke every ten minutes or so.

And most of my other friends, some heavy users and some quite naive will have problems with throwing up a least once during a night of getting high.

**A little backstory:** I've been able to quit using opiates several times with a fair amount of success, but quite the opposite with cigarettes. I've been smoking daily for the past 7 years, while my opiate struggle has been a bit less consistent but has still lasted the better part of 4 years. 

Personally, I've found that when I don't have the means to acquire opiates for a day, a few days or a week-plus my mind comes to terms with it much quicker. I somehow arrive at acceptance faster than one might expect.

With cigarettes, if I can't smoke for let's say a day or a few days (for whatever reason) I immediately have a relatively minor, yet very real, panic attack. My heart begins racing and I start thinking very irrationally. It's almost like a more pronounced feeling of *needing* more coke/crack and becoming quite panicky and uncomfortable. 

I guess what I'd like to know from you guys/gals is how you react to not being able to smoke cigarettes vs. the same situation with opiates.

The reason I've been thinking about this a lot lately is because it seems somewhat unreasonable to me. With cigarettes, you generally don't run the risk of severe physical withdrawal, and there is a much less noticeable ""high"" or effect from smoking (sure, there is a level of relief, but it's much more subtle) which to me equates to less severe side-effects.

TL;DR: Noticed I have a much harder time going without cigarettes than opiates despite being addicted to both. Much more anxiety/stress/mental symptoms when I don't have cigs than with opiates & it seems counter-intuitive to me. Can you all compare/contrast your experiences with both substances? 

Thanks all.

I like in NJ and my gf recently moved about an hour away to PA for grad school. So I stopped home after work to pack a bag of some clothes to come up for the weekend. I live in a shitty neighborhood (we're literally the only white residents in the neighborhood, not that it matters just saying.) 

My next door neighbor is a junkie ""I've got a habit"" was the phrase he repeated constantly when I first told him I use dope while trying to be friendly when we first moved in and giving him a ride to 711. Anyway, after being home for 5 mins he must've seen me driving away and called to see if I was leaving town for the weekend, as usual, probably because he wanted a ride to pick up. He's unemployed and doesn't have a car, so I always drive when I wanna score because I have no connects so when I score it's always by having him middle for me.

I said yeah I was leaving town and he was just ""all right, have a good weekend."" About twenty seconds later I called him back to ask if anything was actually right in town and I could score without having to drive anywhere to pickup. He said yeah, so I immediately hit the atm and went back to town. Of course, when I get there I find out it wasn't actually on our block like he implied, but fortunately I only hadda take us a few blocks away, just a five minute right.

I give him my $50 for the 5 stamps I wanted, realizing as I circle the block he was gonna throw down $20 and get a full bundle and keep 5 for himself, instead of at least throwing me a 6th for free like would've been the decent thing to do. I shug, fuck it, least I'm getting what I want all within 15 mins. I pick him back up, get my 5 and drop him back off on the street next to ours (I don't ever want my roommates to see us together, cause they'd immediately figure out why we were together.

I stop at my moms house 5 minutes away to give her a few bucks to help out, like I always do the weeks I get paid (bi-weekly.) I go in the bathroom after cutting a straw and dump one out to blow, just to see the size. A fucking bump is literally all this first stamp was. I only wanted to do one stamp before the drive up to PA, but seeing how scummily small they were, I did two and ate a mg of Xanax to give it a boost.

Felt it, but not so much. Make the drive up to my girls, about an hour ride, barely feeling it. So I got here about 45 minutes ago, went to the bathroom and dumped out my other three bags on the counter, tearing apart the stamps and scraping out every last grain of the tan powder. I blew it all up and popped two more .5 mgs Xanax, washing them down with the rum and coke I'm drinking now. 

So now, as I write this, 5 stamps, 2 mgs of Xanax, and my tasty Captain cocktail, I'm actually feeling pretty fucking great. Not full uncontrollably nodding kinda high, but the step right before that. Hugged by invisible puppy clouds, itchy, warm and content.

And for the record, my gf who is sitting two feet away from me as I write this does not know I'm still using, but she's very drug naïve and can't tell. So now I'm content to enjoy a nice relaxing night, feeling my love and hanging out with my human love.

I know this was a very uneventful story, I just felt like sharing todays tale of acquiring and enjoying my favorite substance. Happy nods all, may you score bigger bags than I did today (but hey, at least I'm high).

I have a bunch of hydrocodone 7.5/750mg, so yesterday I took 8 of them, and performed a cwe (crushed pills, shook up in pill bottle w/ about 50-75ml of water, but bottle in ice bath for a bit, then strained through one coffee filter, threw that in the freezer for a bit, then strained through two more filters).

What I'm getting at is...how much APAP do you think could still be in there? I just really REALLY do not want to hurt myself. I'm doing this for harm reduction. I figured, since the water solubility of acetaminophen is 12.78mg/ml (according to wiki)...let's say I used upwards of 100ml of water, and let's pretend the water wasn't cold enough. AT MOST, the extraction should contain 1,278 mg of APAP, right?

Also, I'm assuming coffee filters aren't that full-proof, so I'd guess there's some acetaminophen that slipped by. What can I approximately count on the extraction containing? The substance is a little cloudy but I believe I did everything right. I made it for two doses of hydro (30mg), and I'd really like to stop being a baby and drink it, but I just wanna make sure that before I do I couldn't possibly end up drinking a ton of apap. I've been taking it for surgery, so it's built up in my system and I don't want to over-do it. Like I said, with about 75ml of water tops, and seemingly doing the whole process right, there should only be about 1,000 mg of APAP in the whole extraction, riiiight?

EDIT: For anyone interested, I drank probably 40mg worth of it and close to nothing happened. I just decided to eat some pills instead. I have no idea what I did wrong, but I must have done a horrible job dissolving the pills or lost a lot of the spiked water elsewhere, because my tolerance definitely isn't that high. Probably the last time I do that, unfortunately. lol",1373044340.0

Background real quick: i'm a young adult male, about 200lbs. I have been doing opiates on and off for about 5 years(i've done tramadol, codeine hydrocodone, oxycodone, suboxone once, and smoked tar once). I have never been addicted(cliche, I know) but I really have not. I've gone on 1 -5 week long hydro and oxy binges multiple times and quit cold turkey the next day with 0 side effects besides being a tiny bit moody for a day or two. I'm not too sure of my tolerance as of right now(2 weeks ago I took a decent amount of tramadol over 2 days, nothing too crazy though, no other opiates since mid May), but typically if I go on a month or longer break, I take about 40mg oxy and it gets me nice, 70mg would have me nodding super hard.

I tried H for the first(second?) time tonight. It was powdered, kinda ""cream"" colored(as if someone took the color white and added a lil bit of brown to it). I'm in NY(not gonna say where but not in the city) and the stamps had ""big apple"" on them, with the apple being the Apple company logo. Anyone know anything about these, and if they're ""fire"" or not? I railed .1, felt great for 30 mins, railed another .1 and same thing. I've done good coke once, and it was not close at all to the burn, and it was kinda rough compared to roxi's. Is this normal for most H? At about an hour after the second dose(so about 2 hrs) most of the feeling was gone. I was still itchy(noticeably itchier than hydro or oxy), still had some euphoria/good feelings, but not anything to brag about. Is this normal? Or is this stuff just not that good? I was with my GF watching a movie, and the only time I nodded off was when she was on top when we were having sex(she thought I was trying to picture her being someone else lol). Also, would it be better to rail or parachute this stuff? I'm not looking to IV it(just not my thing).

Thanks guys! appreciate it. Also, any tips or anything experienced people wished they knew, please feel free to let me know.",1373176726.0

I've had an Oxy addiction for the past few years, usually doing 1-2 a day. I have a few hookups, and everything usually goes just peachy. Today I bought ten, from one of my regular guys. Actually, I got them from his hookup. His hookup doesn't do Roxys, but claims he got them from people with actual prescriptions.. 

Three of these looks like the imprint wasn't printed deep enough, and the other look pretty straight. I did notice that the color was a bit deeper blue than the A215's that my mother is scripted. 

[Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/vh6bPlH.jpg)
In this picture the one on the far left is from my mom. The one in the middle and right are from the ones I bought today. Notice how the imprint is barely visible on the one on the right.

[Picture 2](http://i.imgur.com/4zxPjP7.jpg)
The group on the left is from my mom, and the ground on the right is from my guy. You can see how two of them look strange. The one that has a piece missing out of it was for a taste test, they did taste fine.

I'm a bit sketched out with all of the fake Roxy stories I've heard lately.. Although I haven't heard of any fake 215's.

What I'm thinking is that due to small manufacturing differences they might have come out a bit differently. The only other differences are a slight darker color on the batch I bought. When I say slight, I really do maybe 1/5th of a millimeter shorter. 

I think I'm just being a bit too paranoid.. I usually get the ""V cuts,"" but have done plenty of Roxys in the past without even looking at them. Has anyone gotten a legit prescription where some of the pills looked different than others? What about just getting fake A215's that you could tell were fake?

Thanks guys!

Immediately, I had a panic attack (which I believe did me good), my heart started beating quite fastly and I was forcing myself to breath. I didn't notice that I been been breathing less and less, however after my panic attack was over came to, and felt much better. I was with my family and I was quite worried that my lips or skin might start turning blue and that they'd notice. However I also knew that no matter what happened, I'd be safe with them.

I'm a fucking retard.,"So I got kicked out of my house and left my girlfriend a week ago and basically have just been stealing and doing stupid shit so I can get my two favorite drugs, heroin and coke. And I have been doing a lot of both. I'm getting high almost every hour. 

So this morning I needed my wake up speedball. I walk to burger King (I don't usually hang out in here, my spot has been McDonald's the past week)   and accidentally pour out two or three times my normal dose of coke but think nothing of it, I just want to get high, and I throw in one bag of dope (running low). So I hit and I get the ear ring. It's so intense. Beyond anything I have ever felt. It was almost like nitrous only with a speed high instead of a dissociative high. I wake up twenty minutes later In a puddle of blood and puke. I walk out and ask the lady who is working If I could have a glass if water. I get it and leave like nothing happened. 

10-20 minutes ago I walk back into the same burger King so I can do a small speedball. I get everything ready, it's a normal to smaller dose and I shoot it. 

Fuck. I missed. Lovely, I have 4 fucking bags of dope left and that has to last me till noon tomorrow. Oh but I have plenty of coke... One more small shot won't kill me. Once again I pour out a little too much. Oh well. I hit and stand up, I don't have to puke which is nice but my entire body Is shaking. I walk over to the toilet and boom. I wake up a few minutes later once again in a puddle of blood and puke. 

My ears are still fucking ringing and I'll probably do another fucking speedball when I end up leaving this establishment. I'm sick of this disease. I hate who I'm becoming. And I'll probably be dead in a week at the rate I going.

After starting heroin more seriously last year i've noticed how to shit my health has gone. I've lost a pretty significant amount of weight, not that I was large to begin with. I want to quit so damn bad because I feel terrible, but when I look in the mirror I see the skeleton of my former self I have become and immediately want to get high to do with the massive anxiety that's exacerbated by my gaunt appearance. 

It seems like what's the damn point? I'm already pretty fucked, bad trackmarks from compulsively shooting coke and heroin, thin ass face that people are starting to mention ""have you lost weight recently?"". i've been putting as much weight as possible in to my veins, but overall i'm suffering.

Any fellow brewers out that want to help me perfect my recipe?,"So I've been making poppy tea now for over a year and I've got my personal recipe down pretty well. There are still a few unanswered questions I have and would like some help. I'd also like to help answer anyone else's questions they have in regard to making this glorious drink.

My Recipe:
I start with 2 poppies about a little smaller than my fist each, maybe 3 to 4 inches in diameter. I cut them in half to empty the seeds. (save your seeds and grow some poppy's as it is legal to grow them in the US btw) I grind up all 4 hemispheres in a coffee grinder until half is about powder and half is a little large bits. Then I heat up about a pint of grapefruit juice. I use grapefruit juice because it has a really good acidity level to extract the opiates and because the grapefruit juice has a weak MAOI inhibitor in it, (the MAOI should keep the opiates from breaking down in your system as fast, it should keep you higher longer, albeit I am not sure how strong the MAOI is in a glass of grapefruit juice, could do nothing at all, I don't know) and also I just use grapefruit juice because it makes it taste good. USE 100% GRAPEFRUIT JUICE, NOT FROM CONCENTRATE. Add about 3 tablespoons of water so that the process of boiling doesn't boil down your grapefruit juice into a kind of concentration, it gets kinda sweet and thick if you don't. I let the ""pukelike"" mixture boil for about 5 to 10 minutes. Then I strain it as many times as I can to get as much shit out of it as it is disgusting to drink the little bits of poppy. Add a couple ice cubes and voilà! you have your self a pretty damn good day ahead of you.

My questions are these:
1. I heard that heat can destroy some of the opiates. Am I letting it boil too long if I boil it for 10 minutes.
2. Does the MAOI inhibitor in the grapefruit juice have any benefit?
3. Does anybody have any suggestions how to get a better yield on the opiates in the tea? Or any suggestions at all?

Thank you.",1373322748.0

Opiates consumed my life for 7 years. Took a few rehab trips and tried to get clean but never made it more than 6 months without getting high. Everything I did revolved around them. 

Now I am 25 years old and a United States Marine going on 2.5 years time in service. I have been clean ever sense I joined and I love what I do But I know you guys will understand when I say I miss it... Opiates had such a impact on my life at an age when I was ""Growing up"" I know it will be embedded in my mind forever.

I can only assume that this isn't healthy for me. guess I am just venting.

I was able to get pretty high the first day, and more so the next day.

I didn't see this in the FAQ (it should be, imo), but here's my question:

If I dosed some buprenorphine today (another 6 mg), and since buprenorphine has such a high binding affinity to all three receptors, it wouldn't matter how much dope I take, I couldn't knock the bupe off the receptors, right?

Even if I bought a bun and blew (intranasal, 40-60% BA) through it?

I'd have to wait for the bupe to halve at least once so the dope could at least bind to *some* receptors?

Bonus question (note: I don't plan on trying this):  If one used narcan to clear the receptors, could one just dose some dope right after and balance out the precipitated withdrawal?

Or does the narcan stay on the receptor for a while (essentially fucking one over for a while if one were to try this)?

So I hatched a plan to get clean. I went out and copped a single 8mg strip of suboxone. The way I do the sub treatment is to induce with a .25mg dose. Every 2 hours after that, I take another .25mg until all the pain is gone. A single strip can last my junky ass about 4-6 days like this. So one strip does me justice.

The first week comes and goes. I don't start using the sub yet, I'm still busy hooking up friends and of course getting a cut of their sacks. It's what I've always done and partially what's always kept me in the game - other people needing, not me.

Anyways, I continue blowing my dope for the first week. Week 2 rolls around. By now I'm getting serious about trying to quit. I turned off my phone, hid in my basement on the computer for the first 24 hours and finally, lord God finally, took my first dose of the sub.

But, ive never really 'nodded' for a long period of time, i much prefer high doses of opiates but ive never really had a situation or dose high enough to let me sit there and nod in and out and let the waves of euphoria rush over me.

I mean id eat 100mg oxy IR, or snort that much in a night and i still wouldnt, because i always dosed high but not quite enough to nod, i did alot of poppy pod tea as well which fucks your tollerence way too much for how high it gets you.

That changes tonight thanks to silk road.

i have half a gram of 85% #4 in front of me, an 8mg sub tablet and everyones out for the night. 

Snorted roughly 10mg of it a few days ago and i was feeling pretty cruisey at work for about 4-5 hours.

I don't really mean to brag(honest) im actually EXTREMELY excited right now. Does anyone else wanna share a story of when they were really fucking excited about getting high? hah

Wish me luck!


Update - 22 minutes, probobly snorted about 40mg now, really itchy, and put on my onesie and grabbed some munchies!! Any ideas of what to do online? Would love to chat in tinychat too im on there now

-update- lol well i ended up snorting about 150mg all up before i nodded out on my keyboard for20 minutes and woke up with a sore neck, it was fucking fun, so euphoric. Felt a bit sick after the high though haha guess that happens when you havent got fucked up for a while, i kept snorting 20mg every 30 minutes or so, still got 340mg left, stashing that until next time (i dont use often).

I tried to clean it for like 30 minutes with soap hydrogen peroxide, water , boiled it and then  even put a lighter to the needle
the clog seemed to get worse.

Against all rational judgement I decided to use it anyway.  I guess I didn't use enough citric because after I drew up the solution thickened in the syringe. I pushed it back into my cooker and heated it again with more citric and dre it up again. I got in a vein but I couldn't pull the plunger back to register .... I missed. Tried again on a differ vein and no luck.  

Tried a third vein and missed due to the amount of force I had to use to depress the plunger. Was bleeding a lot and and I could see soot from the needle because I put a lighter too it. I ended up just squirting the solution up my nostril.

After wards I noticed the gunk that was in the syringe was gone, and that it was no longer clogged. Hoping that stuff didn't get in my vein.

I have used it before I started the Effexor, and I actually find it very recreational and pleasurable, which contradicts many other opiate user's opinions, as people claim that it is not recreational at all.

Personally, I'm not an everyday smoker, but having a pack around when I get pills is a requirement.  So what's your brand? I like to switch it up once and a while but my two favorites are Camel Menthols and Newport 85's. 


The first cigarettes I truly enjoyed were Camel Turkish Golds. After a night of snorting coke and bumming smokes I found myself craving the cigarettes rather than the cocaine the next day. I smoked those for a few years. Camel also used to make flavored cigarettes that came in metal tins, flavors such as citrus(Twists) and chocolate(chocolate mint maybe?). I think they had to give up making those as they were deemed to be aimed at getting kids, or at least the younger crowd, to start smoking. Oh Joe Camel, when will you learn to leave the children alone!?


I got turned on to smoking Menthols after a six month stay in rehab. My friend smoked Pall Mall menthol 100s and we would split packs. After leaving rehab I stated smoking Camel Crushes. I loved the novelty of being able to choose whether I wanted a regular or menthol cigarette, and the oh so satisfying *POP!* of crushing the menthol bead in the filter. I found myself crushing them after 2 or 3 drags every time though so I just switched over to Camel Menthols. I've always had an affinity toward Camels for some reason. 


Most recently a friend introduced me to electronic cigarettes. She has this cool little setup that she got in Dallas. You can buy all different flavored nicotine laced ""juices"", her flavor of choice is a mixture of Atomic Fireball and Twinkie. Nothing more manly then pulling a mean cloud of a fat kid's wet-dream flavored vapor out of her hot pink e-cig. Other e-cigs left something to be desired but this one hits hard, leaves me feeling satisfied. I think I may invest in one, the allure of flavors such as Dr Pepper and cheesecake are tempting.

But for now I'll stick with my cancer sticks. So what chu smoking on these days?



Edit: a little late, but if any of you smokers out there would like to quit by going to an electronic cigarette, I highly recommend the [Joyetech eGo-C](http://www.joyetech.com/product/eGoC.php) 
I've tried other e-cigs including the popular Blu and nothing is quite as satisfying or adjustable as this one. With a huge amount of flavored juices and the ability to mix and create your own flavor, this one takes the Cake; which I'm sure is a flavor you could get for this bad boy. My girl turned me onto this e-cig and I'd have no problem dropping $80-100 on one when I get a little extra money.",1373695335.0

Anyway, here's a question for you bros.  Let's talk about pills and cigarettes.  Are cigarettes (normal tobacco) a potentiator for opiates?  For example, when I take a handful of oxys, the high is good but once I smoke a cigarette it takes it to the next level.  Then I can't stop smoking because the more I do, the longer I'm flying.

This goes for everyday pills also - like just plain old Tylenol 3 - I could take six or ten and not feel a thing but when I smoke it finally gets me high.  Does smoking do this for you guys?

What is it in the cigarette that makes this happen?  I'm asking because I'm trying to quit smoking but I can't because I need it to get high.  Is there anything else I can use to make this happen?  Do electronic cigarettes do this?

I would love to hear Any experiences with smoking on opiates

1i6dd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1i6dd8/first_time_plugging/,11,https://redd.it/1i6dd8,LivinTheWetDream,First Time Plugging,"So this is really just an open ended account of the experience, I'm not usually one to clinically document my drug use on any platform, so ill apologize if this is all over the place. But I felt like sharing this one upon reflection on how ridiculous situations that would repulse 95% of the world at large (drug users included) are completely taken in stride if you have an itch to scratch. It's very nearly a vindicating realization, in some way that Im having trouble articulating, but one that is tempered by the fact that I have never been this plugged up in my life of drug abuse and am starting to fear that a return to the scene of the crime to personally rectify (..) the situation with some sort of geriatric suppository laxative is going to be necessary.

Ah but anyway the whole situation was completely unplanned and at the time felt like some sort of reptilian brain base reaction, I have never put anything in my ass, never even entertained the notion, (have had a couple girls offer to mix it into the usual drug-numbed routine and turned it down even). So needless to say it was surprising to say the least when I looked down at the broken fucked up jammed rig and realized exactly what I had to do. 

And also, to explain it a little further before I break down how it felt and everything, I had already taken a shot of something flying under one of the usual generic banners (diesel flame etc) these ghetto bastards have the audacity to peddle their milk sugar/insert-corrosive-adulterant-here/heroin under on occasion. Ill never understand it, most often they dont even fucking do some quality control and personally make sure they arent putting a lethal bag in someones hand, or a complete bunk let down. its some kind of a unique capitalistic sociopathy that can only really flourish in unregulated drug markets, but that I believe illustrates a vivid facet of humanity and the free market. Anyway, This turned out to be the latter, but in the interest of (somewhat paradoxical) self preservation, I decided to do a shot on the smaller side just in case. Mainly because it was the first time I bought from the guy and am a solitary drug user, chipping at that, and the luxury of being dumped unconscious in an alley while your ""friends"" call an ambulance from a payphone in the event of an OD is not one I have. So I usually play it safe and choose the possible underwhelming shot over dying alone in my car or wherever, just redose as soon as possible and get a good glow going. I went to do that this time, with my 6 week old one shot veterinary syringe, and the damn point broke off right at the base. At first I was not unduly concerned, I had a (supremely disappointing) dose of dope making the rounds of my circulatory system and thinking with the usual coolness, figured I'd just pull the plunger out of the tool and dump the shit out, maybe sniff it since by that point the rush wasnt going to happen anyway and I was just hoping to quickly supplement the buzz i had. But by some goddamned cruel magic of the physical universe the dope was somehow vacuum sealed into the rig, couldnt shake it out, couldnt suck it out, I still cant work out why honestly and im sure someone will explain an easy fix to me (if anyone even reads all this shit) but at the time it stumped me and i panicked. with my glow rapidly fading into moderate sedation, i started viciously gnawing at the base holding the remains of the needle assuming that it was the source of my trouble, completely transcendentally oblivious to my surroundings, for a good 10 minutes until i produced a workable ragged hole to pump the dope through. 

and finally at that point some minimum level of cognition returned to me and i realized that too much time had passed, sniffing the liquid would be a complete waste, the only option I had was to plug the mangled plastic remains of the syringe gingerly into my ass if I wanted a chance at salvaging the night. gingerly so as not to spill the drugs mind you, the sharp abrasive plastic tip penetrating my ass and the pain resulting hadnt yet been realized, my dope fiend instinct brain completely bypassed the thoughtful and meticulous brain and without even going somewhere private (or finding some kind of lubricant) i just turned to the side and went for it.

And so now that I explained the circumstances, it wasnt all that good at all. I would say that it was better than a blown shot or something,(and not as painful) but with a comparable amount of raw powder I wouldve preferred just sniffing it I think. Even with the seal broken by a low dose back to back shots are always apparent for me, I assumed it would be sort of similar with maybe a slower burn, but still a pretty rapid come up. It was interesting that the warmth i usually can feel from a shot was concentrated in my ass,albeit barely tangible, and with a lot more I could see it being pretty intense and nice, but cant imagine why anyone would ever do that rather than shoot. in terms of social stigma, jamming drugs up your ass to get high has to be on par with IVing, and it seems like itd be a rare person to strike that balance of ""too hesitant to IV but receptive to plugging"" in order to get high.


and a couple footnotes, I know I inserted it deep enough, at least 1.5 inches if not more, i stayed still for a while so it wouldnt just leak out, did all that. So if anyone has a similar experience and either liked it or hated it id like to read them, or has some insight into why it sucked so much, it might reduce some of the post insertion shame im feeling.

I've been planning it for a while now and tonight all the stars were in alignment. The rigs I'm using are 27g x 1/2. I loaded up the rig and after much nervousness, I put the needle to my skin. I was pushing down pretty hard and the needle wasn't puncturing the vein in the crook of my elbow. I am pretty fit and my veins are pretty visible so it seems like I would only need to push in a little bit to hit the vein.  I was getting a little worried cause I felt like if I pushed too hard it would suddenly just push all the way through. After pushing harder and harder I think I got it in a little bit but I got scared, when i pulled it out and there was a little mark. Can anyone help me or give any advice, I would like to shoot this before the night is over.",1373871775.0
1ibnb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ibnb7/2013/,44,https://redd.it/1ibnb7,SurfinCow,2013,"So my year started off great. I started talking to my teenage dream again in December and we hit it off right away. She was holding something back and I couldn't figure out what the fuck it was. I was completely oblivious as to what was going on outside of my room. I had been self medicating with alcohol for some time and I couldn't even tell you why..Maybe because I'm a drop-out, burnout, fuckout? I'm just an emotional sonofabitch. So about a week after she chats me up on Facebook, we connect. She had flaked out on me a time or two but then she hits me up to go on an ""adventure"" with her. Mind you, I've hardly eaten or slept all week because I'm madly in love with this girl. Also, It's December ( I live in NJ ) cold as fuck, bundled as fuck, walk out to her car and see her for the first time in years. I make her get out of her car and she gives me a huge hug. I felt like I was being squeezed by a thousand Angels. I think to myself, ""This is as close as I'll ever get to Heaven.""

She has me drive, whatever, I dig. I drive us to a park with a beach within walking distance. We lept onto swings, seesaws, pirate ships, It all meant the same. We smoked cigarettes and danced with the cold nights breeze. I felt alive for the first time in what seemed an eternity. I acted half my age and I didn't give a hoot. We walked down to the beach and watched the sunrise and that's where she laid it on me. She was a recovering heroin addict. I didn't think much of it.. I didn't know anything about it. I was completely uneducated on the subject. She told me she's been clean for 5 months, I believed her. I mean, she looked healthy, she conquered the affliction known as addiction, and I believe she was clean for those 5 months to this day. We hung out a bunch after that but then I stopped hearing from her towards the end of January. Early February she Od's and dies.

At this point I'm fucked beyond belief. I wanted to feel what she felt before she met her maker. I started mixing Blues, Benzos and alcohol. I had a fucking deathwith. This went on for months, me waking up not knowing what the fuck just happened and repeating it, over, and over, and over. I'm glad I'm alive, and that my body never stopped pumping blood and breathing, and that I managed to wake up day after fuckless day.This went on for a few months. During that time I got a taste of Heroin. The day I put that shit up my nose was the most tranquil day of my life. The connect wasn't stable, but I was going to make sure I found someone who was. I got desperate, after weeks of contemplating whether to cold cop or not I decided to hit up everyone within 50 miles that I thought was affiliated with drugs, clean or not, I felt like shit but It's just what I had to do. I got a connect. Driving up top with a bunch of junkies multiple times week to score. I blew the shit for like 2 months and I started bangin' it like 2 weeks ago. Oh yeah, during my reckless stint with death I burned bridges left and right, fucking my friends girlfriends and the like. Fuck, man..

Right about when I started bangin' the shit I get hit up by the girls best friend. ( I tried copping from her friends after her passing, I know, I'm a piece of shit. ) She's been in the game for 6 years and wants to get high, but I know she's been clean for 2 months. I hesitate all day but figure ""Why the fuck not, better me she's getting high with than some scumbag fuck."" So she starts coming over and getting high and we get down. I don't ask her for a dime, I just like seeing people happy even though it always leads to my downfall. I'm far too kind and that'll probably never change. We're getting high in my room at my parents house all day. I don't think much of it, I mean, It's awesome. Getting high and fucked.. Living.. this must be it. So I don't see her for a day then I go get her and we inevitably walk into my room and load our guns.

Her: Was I doing half a bag or a bag and a half?

Me: I'm pretty sure you were doing a half babe.

( Remember she's been 2 months clean until she decided to get loaded with me. The dope I get is pretty good too considering the people I go cop with have been in the game for 15 years. )

So she loads up a bag and a half and the rest is history. The last thing she said while falling out was ""I've got double vision."" She goes limp, I start freaking the fuck out. I remember the dude I go cop with be like ""Yo if someone falls out don't be afraid to get physical with em'."" So I start slapping the shit out of this cunt. Shaking her. Trying to get her to walk. Ice down her panties. Limp. I calm down a bit and check her vitals. She has a heart beat but hasn't been breathing, not even faintly. I start giving her mouth to mouth and that goes on for about 10 minutes. Between slapping her, shaking her and breathing for her she came to twice, only for a moment though, trying to take huge breaths while her eyes open up wide but then she falls out again. Limp, eyes in the back of her head, gone. She finally comes to and it holds. I'm so fucking relieved and rattled at this point the first thing I do is light a cigarette and ponder on what the fuck just happened. This happened for 2 weeks and she fell out 3 more times with her not breathing and me having to breath for her. Scary shit, man. I eventually ran out of dope and money and have been clean for 37 hours, the latter half being fucking hell. I hadn't been sober since the beginning of the year and had only heard of what WD's were like. I kind of wanted to finally feel it as sick as that sounds. I love this drug but I hate it at the same time. I get a shit eating grin just thinking about a needle now, It's fucked. My relations with this fine lady definitely haven't ended. I'll be back, killing time, killing pain, killing myself. Because It's worth it. It's just fucking worth it.

I found a recipe for Laudanum and thought I would give it a try. I am a once every week/2weeks PST user. Trying to find some stuff for pod tea, as I hear its better in almost every way. However being unable to find pods and having to order them off the SR. From the SR buyer I found a link to a DIY recipe for Laudanum, I have posted it below.

>
Hello my fellow connoisseurs!

>Today I bring to you a step-by-step guide on a simple and crude guide for the lazy layman that just wants to drink his opiates, dammit! ;P

>Things you will require:

>-A 1 liter bottle of some sort (can be nalgene or glass)

>-Ground poppy pods (approx. 10 g for this recipe)

>-At least .5 L of Hard liquor (I used Hendrick's gin)

>-Cinnamon

>-Sugar

>-Coffee filters

>Optional Ingredients (I will explain these later):
>-Etizolam
>-Cetirizine tablets (aka Zyrtec)

>Step 1: Put the dried poppy pod material into your bottle. I eyeballed it, but I would venture to say I used about 10 grams of the ground pods from High Carts.

>Step 2: Put about 2-3 tablespoons of sugar into bottle.

>Step 3: Put as much cinnamon as you think you would like. I used ground, but you may use sticks (in this case, I suggest 2).

>Step 4: Pour in the gin! I poured in 500 mL.
*Optional* Step 4a: Add 2 mg etizolam for added nod and hypnotic properties.
*Optional* Step 4b: Add 20 mg cetirizine to counteract possible itchy side-effects.

>Step 5: Close the bottle tightly and shake, shake, shake that baby up!

>Step 6: Put the bottle in a cool, dark place and shake it every once in a while. Wait for at least 24 hours >before opening.

>**At the 24 hour mark I only took out a portion at a time so that it would keep brewing, but you can strain >the whole thing and be done with it already**

>Step 7: Once 24 hours have passed and many shakings of the bottle have occurred, it is time to open up that bottle of wonder. First prepare another container that will hold your Zipstylaudanum ;) lol. Secure a coffee filter over a second container with a rubber band so you can just pour into it. POUR SLOWLY. You will most likely need to use SEVERAL coffee filters throughout the course of your filtering process. The next step will explain why.

>Step 8: You will notice that there will be chunks of poppy pods in your filter, and soon enough of them will accumulate to the point where not much liquid will filter through anymore. At this point, you need to take the filter off the top, scrunch it at the top, and squeeze (carefully, you don't wanna rip your filter!) those pod chunks. I believe this is where most of the opiates are! Use those strong muscles ;)

>Step 9: You should now have a very dark brown if not darker liquid, which I call the crude laudanum. BE VERY CAREFUL AND RESPECTFUL OF THIS SUBSTANCE. You are mixing several very potent and potentially dangerous drugs together. Overdose is DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. Also take into consideration that the opiates can take a while to kick in, so only dose 1 shot every hour or so until you become familiar and experienced with the effects. All of the drugs in this concoction are depressants, so keep that in mind please.

>Step 10: Take a shot (NOT THE IV KIND! lol), lay down, and ENJOY! If you were successful, you will be drifting off into nodland and morphine dream world within the next 30 minutes :)

>I hope this is helpful to those interested in an easy do-it-yourself laudanum guide.
>Do enjoy responsibly and post back your results!
>You may also want to add some lemon or orange juice and see if that helps.



The thing is 10G seems really low for that amount of liquid, but I could be wrong as I've never played with Poppy pods before.

I told them I don't consent and they closed my car door. Then, a cop came up to me and said they saw a needle in my car and if it tested to anything, it would get bad for me.

After the cops left, I got back in my car and saw that a needle (i'm assuming it was the one he was talking about, I can't be sure there wasn't another one somewhere) in my car door.

There was one cop left and I asked him if they were going to take the needle ( had washed it out at that point). He told me that the cop didn't do anything, and looked kind of dejected.

Is a needle something that they would have tested on site? If he did take another needle, how long does it take to test? Would the cop have collected all the needles in my car to see if any of them had residue in them?

Also, FYI, I am diabetic and told them this. the EMS checked my blood sugar and it was out of normal range.

It's just a very confusing situation, and I don't know if I should be super worried or not.

Any insight would be great. Thanks.

edit: would they have to tell me and make me sign something or whatever if they were collecting evidence? How does that work?",1373859608.0

I tried the suboxone thing on & off, but it never sticks, because I have chronic pain & it just doesn't help with that. 

But today, it just kinda fell into my lap, and my habit's been leaving me broke & sick more and more frequently, so here I am. I don't prefer it to dope or oxy when it comes to the high, but for maintenance, it's my pick. It's still a love/hate relationship though.

First he tells me that when you snort heroin it drains into your esophagus and you get just as high as when it's absorbing through the blood vessels in your sinus cavity cause it's absorbing through blood vessels in your esophagus. But I say that it's gonna go into your stomach and you're gonna get less high cause it's in your stomach and you are absorbing it that way and you only get like 30% of the drug. And the other thing he tried to tell me was that your tolerance doesn't matter if you try different varities of heroin. Not varieties like ECP compared to black tar but like different powders that you get from different dudes that are nearly the same in strength but they are just coming from a different source. I don't even know his reasoning behind that but it's gotta be bullshit cause it just doesn't make a lick of sense to me.

my marriage has been in a failing state for nearly two years. we are seperated now. and between that and all the emotional baggage i've been carrying around for years, i just couldn't cope anymore. i've tried to take myself out of the picture completely, twice in the past year. i apparently can't even do that correctly. i was found both times. i see a counselor and a shrink these days, but i got tired of being a lab rat. i hate ssri medications, so, i self medicate. that's getting hard to do, though. money has become tighter than ever and h has become scarce in my area. i've been using the road, but it's so damn expensive!

anyway. when you've already got a lot of emotional shit going on, every little thing starts to eat at you. for me, it's the constantly being let down by people and being bailed on. in all of my use, i've never *quit* on someone. i've always been honest and i continued to be a constant source of support for anyone who was going through a bad time. i have a huge heart, so i've been told. but then it's just so fucking easy to just leave me when i'm going through some hard times myself. it's not fucking fair.

With tar, unless you purposefully and patiently suck your cottons dry, you're left with a decent amount in each and every cotton.

Right now, I have about .3-.4 left, and I have some more coming later, but I wanted to conserve in case my buddy who owes me a bit can't score before work-so I threw 4 cottons into a spoon, (nearly) boiled some water, drew up 50 units and drenched the cottons.  Immediately, the water turned a lovely brown, and I was able to get a halfway decent shot out of it.

Two quick questions:

1)  I always put my tar AND my cottons into the freezer as soon as I get back from copping/finishing a shot.  First off, as anyone who has worked with tar can attest, that shit will melt quicker than you can say ""I heart dope"" and get all up in the plastic.  Secondly,  I feel like this will inhibit the growth of bacteria in cottons and lower my chance of the dreaded cotton fever. I have done about 8 cotton shots thus far (been here abt a month-I don't use daily, just when I have a bit of extra dosh), and *knocks on wood* I haven't gotten the fever yet.  Back in my pow pow days, I feel like I got the fever about one in ten cotton shots-but then again, my shit never went anywhere near a freezer-I would just throw it in a ciggy pack or something, and throw it in my drawer. 
OH-and I never once got high off a powder cotton shot, even if I was using 2 dozen cottons. Not fucking once. Maybe it would ward off w.d. a couple of hours, but twas NOT worth the fucking risk.
Is there ANY scientific backing behind this, or am I just fooling myself?

2) WHEN the tar does melt a bit into the plastic, what is the most effective way to extract it?  What I've been doing is just throwing the little pieces of tarred plastic (my guy just rips off a bit of a plastic baggie/and or cellophane and throws it in that) into a spoon, dousing it with near (but not fully) boiling water, swirling it around a few times, then gently lifting it out and squeezing it dry.
Is this my best bet to get the most out of my tar, or is there some super technique I am missing? I'm assuming you want to make sure a flame gets no where NEAR that spoon, because I don't fancy a vein full of plastic baggie.

I've been on about 8mg of Suboxone for that time, but I decided to stop taking it cold turkey, and have been off of it for three weeks now. After a year I am finally starting to come back to my old self and remembering who I was before this garbage took over and ruined my life. I don't know what came over me, maybe it was that little voice inside of my head, maybe it was my natural curiosity, but whatever it was, I could NOT stop it.

I found out that my main dealer who went to jail a little while ago is out, and he always came through and delivered the fire Bushwick diesel. He didn't remember who I was since it was so long, and was acting all sketched out. I called him a few times and he said he was coming. He took a while more than usual so I called him again and he said that something came up and he couldn't help me but would call me back in the morning in a few hours. I figured fuck it, he probably thinks I'm a cop or some shit, and that it was meant to be. I gave up on the idea of copping and although I was really pissed that he got me so excited, I was able to fall asleep some how.

For the next few days I thought about copping more than usual, and that I just needed one more time and just wanted to try to slam it and move up to the big leagues. I somehow thought I deserved the high after being clean for so long, and for stopping Suboxone cold turkey, which I was really proud of myself for. I started to get overconfident and began to think that I could finally control myself, because I've been clean for so long, I wasn't about to start going down that dark, cold, miserable road again. 

I remembered my college days, when I was hustling the blues and some fire fishscale. I made almost 2grand a week, so smoking 20 blues a day was the norm, and the withdrawals that came with it. I would pick up 100 blues and a oz of christina a week, but I ended up doing most of my blues instead of selling them. I drove 3 hours and paid 12 a pop and flipped em for 30, but near the end I kept them all for myself. It was a good feeling, knowing that I didn't have to rely on anyone but myself to stay well. Inevitably, my connect ran dry one weekend and I was panicking. I could get them for 30-35 a pop but I didn't feel like getting robbed. In the end I paid whatever anyone asked, I knew I could make my money back. But even with my local connect, eventually he dried up and I didn't have anything.

Laying in my bed pathetically, 30lbs lighter than I've ever been, hot and cold at the same time, wishing I could just be put out of my misery, but not having the energy or will to do it. My skin felt like I had 1000 scarabs crawling through it, and my body was so restless that I couldn't escape it. The whole time I had the antidote less than 5 feet away from me, but I would NOT dare entertain the option of taking some subs, because my connect kept telling me that something would come through soon, and I knew the second I took the subs, he would call me saying we were good to go. I went through this cycle more times than I would like to admit, and at the end of it all, I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.

I'll try not to diverge any more, but I feel like you guys don't know me that well yet, and a little background will help you understand my position and where I'm coming from. Blues and dope ruined my life, and here I was a year clean, finally starting to feel like a real human being again, and something came over me, telling me to go back to the very thing that I regretted starting more than anything. Addiction truly is a disease, and I don't think we will ever fully understand it. It really does change the structure of our brains, and we will never quite be the same as before we started. There will always be that monster deep inside of us, just waiting to come back stronger than ever, but it is our job to keep it under control and to not feed it.

After not hearing from my dealer for a week, I finally gave up on the idea of getting high. But lo and behold, the universe had other plans for me. I get a call from a random number that night, and I never pick up numbers that I don't recognize. Something inside of me told me to pick up, and I did. I recognized his voice instantly, it the was the dope man, telling me that he would be around my hood shortly. My heart rate almost doubled, and I started salivating. Even though I knew how bad of a decision I was making, everything in my body told me to say yes. I met him half an hour later and everything went smoothly. Fat and fire bags just like I remembered. I used for two nights and nodded really hard. But I still wanted more, I wanted to feel something more. I was going to finish up the bundle, but momma dukes ended up catching me, and that was a huge debacle. I kept trying to lie my way out of it, but I was cornered, and came clean, promising them I made a mistake and wouldn't do it again. I had to deal with a lot of lectures and almost getting kicked out of my house, understandably so.

I had one bag left, and I had two syringes stashed away for a rainy day. I was so upset with my mom catching me and that fueled my flame to justify the idea of shooting up. I was thinking about it for a week now, and read up on a lot of information on how to do it properly. Last night I mixed up the shot, sucked it up through a little cotton, and had a beautiful concoction all ready to go. I was really nervous and it took me a few hours and a little weed to build up the courage. I took a giant bowl hit, and decided fuck it, it is now or never. I took an alcohol wipe and wiped down the crook of my arm. I popped the orange cap off the needle after practicing the angle a few times, and was ready to go. I put the needle to my arm and said this is it, no turning back now. I'm not scared of needles, but the needle wasn't really going in, and I was pushing pretty hard and got scared. I couldn't get the needle to go in and finally it broke the skin, but it wouldn't go much deeper. I didn't want to dig around too much and bruise my arm up so I decided fuck it and pulled it out. I was disappointed, but at the same time happy that I saved myself from opening pandora's box.

I decided that tonight was the tonight. Tonight I was going in and there was no turning back. I decided to backload that shit into a new syringe and lost a bit in the process. I wasn't gonna make the same mistake as the night before, so I pumped up with some pushups first, and then fashioned a tourniquet using a piece of rope. I knew that things would be right this time, something inside of me told me that. I finally popped the cap off, exposing the sharp, thin, beautiful needle. I put it in the crook of my arm again, and went for broke. The needle broke the skin this time, and I was really excited. I didn't want to go too deep cause I figured the vein was right there, but I kept pulling back and no blood came out. I went deeper and deeper and something told me to stop. I slowly pulled back on the plunger and my eyes lit up when I saw that beautiful plume of red pull up into the syringe. No going back now I thought to myself, and I pulled down on the plunger, letting god's nectar flow into my bloodstream. All in all I was underwhelmed, maybe I should've used more than half a bag I kept telling myself. I knew right then and there that I needed to do it again, to feel it for real this time. Since then its all I've been thinking about, and I already called my connect to meet him tomorrow with money I don't have. I immediately regret my decision, and I know I'm doing the completely wrong thing. I went down the rabbit hole,  and now I am going to see how deep it really goes.",1374041287.0

The IR's are great fun to bang but today I finally encountered the dark side of shooting pills. I picked up a new pack of rigs and realized I must not be filtering  as much as I should be. I've been pulling up particulants so that the rig is slightly cloudy and as a result I think I might've damaged my veins to a small extent. I usually hit on the first or second time but today I couldn't hit that golden elbow crook so I tried my hands which have always been very easy to hit and also apparently a place I've been hitting too much. I couldn't get it to register at all I literally tried 5 news rigs because I was poking myself so many times the needles were getting dull, it wasn't that I was missing the vein but it almost seemed as if my veins were clogged because after I'd pull out there'd be blood oozing out afterward. I literally started to wonder if my veins are backed up with pill residue because after leaving a prepped rig out I noticed how the cloudy solution would thicken and when I did get my vein to register the blood coagulated with the powder in my solution. Long story short I now have hands that look like they've been cut with razor blades from poking them so much and 7 rigs later plus a hematoma from missing on the inside of my arm. I decided to quit IV'ing and stick to insufflating, but I'm none the less embarrassed because now I have horrendous track marks and after a good 50 stabs only had one succesful shot, fuckcing A I'm an idiot.

So yesterday I asked my neighbor (I live in a bad neighborhood) if he had any stamps on him he'd wanna throw me (he's ""got a habit"" as he always tells me, so daily user in other words, meaning he cops every day).

He had nothing yesterday, but texted me today while I was at working asking if I still wanted a few. I said sure, he asked if I could come to a downtown dope spot but I told him I was at work and couldn't meet up. ""No problem"" he tells me, ""I'll bring it back to the neighborhood and have it for you when you get home."" Okay, I thought, didn't intend to use today but if he's making it easy for me, right on.

Coming home from work, I pass my neighbor on the street walking home and pull over to give him a ride. ""I didn't get it yet."" Of course not, I'm sure whatever you copped earlier you finished off promptly. No problem, he says he's getting a ride soon to go to another dope spot. He asked if I'd drive him then, but I said I had a lot of work to do at the house (I lied) because I fucking hate having to go into the hood. I figured, fuck it, wait for him to go get it.

Three hours later, after a text asking if he made it out there yet he replied ""Sorry, I'll be there in an hour."" Well ..does that mean back to our neighborhood in an hour, or he wont even get to the dope spot (around 15 - 20 mins away) for another hour? I didn't bother to ask so as not to be annoying.

Anyway, that last text was 20 mins ago, (it's 9:20 now) so I'll be lucky to get my stamps by 10:00pm. I was hoping to go to bed early tonight, since I was up for I don't know how long black out drunk and rolling my fucking face off last night. But, fuck it. Once I get my shit I'll stay up as long as the legs keep running. Wouldn't waste good dope by going to sleep before it's worn off.

Sorry for the wall of text, just needed to vent my frustrations on the wait we all know and hate. Should've just taken him myself when I had the chance. Balls.

Update: He delivered at 10:30. The dude in the local ghetto didn't have time to wait around, so they ended up going down to Newark. So I got much fuller stamps than what we would've got locally of much better quality than local as well. So it was worth the wait, and I'm where I want to be. Hope you're all enjoying your own nods.

So, I'm pretty damn happy about that, Turns out it was just swelling from missing. It's been receding in size daily.





I also finally got my own connect, WOOHOO! Now I don't have to worry about finding a  hook up and breaking off the middleman and driver. I just give my buddy, who doesn't use, some gas money and head up the road to meet my new favorite person. He's one of the best dealers I've had in a long time. He;s about the money, so I don't have to sit around waiting. He's always right there after I call him and always hooks it up. He kicks me down a free bag for every 10 I buy or help him sell. Plus, I get the benefits of being a middleman (woman?).





I also had a meet up with two other bropes and it went super smooth. This weekend one of them invited me to come crash a few nights on his couch and show him around the city, and another brope who I have yet to meet lives out there and wants to kick it. He seems really cool, so I'm going to give him a holler when I get there.



So all around, I've had a solid week and am stoked on how my luck's been going lately.

My best friend and myself have been shooting up heroin consistently since 09, it's been a big part of our lives since high school and I love it oh so dearly. Our girlfriends do not. They like drinking and smoking weed, the occasional meth, but never heroin.

Well, last night they decided to try heroin. It was really fucking weird, hearing that they wanted to try something that I've had to hide for years. 

While my friend was out getting some (dog)food me and the broads discussed it and they were genuinely excited, they wanted to feel what made us love it more than them. Kind of a backhanded insult to us, but I understood, I love heroin more than my broad, not really a secret. 

Well, my friend showed up at my house, heroin in hand, and we proceeded to the basement, a place of solitude, away from the parents ever snooping ears. Side note: My parents had an idea that I was into drugs, but only thought it was weed and drinking, never h dog.

We commenced the shooting of the dope, the girls loved it. But, good times were not had by all. We hear steps coming from upstairs to the basement, fuck. Hide everything. It was to no avail, as my father watched everything through the small windows that line my basements wall, he watched my girl, my bestfriend, his girl and myself using intravenous drugs. He was in fucking tears while kicking all of them out. I was left to stay.

He is/has call(ed)(ing) all of their parents, I'm under strict watch, and about to slip into withdrawals. Fuck all of this. I have no clue what to do. I'm probably about to lose my babe, my bro and the love of my life. Fuck.

I've been posting comments here for about a year now and I can genuinely say that this is one of my favorite subreddits. Everyone here is just so helpful and nice to each other. It's just wonderful. If someone is in a really bad mood or suffering from depression I see you guys offer guidance and most importantly friendship, someone to talk to. I've always been a bit of a shy person, but I feel I can completely and 100% be myself here with no judgement. I'm not sure how many people are in the same boat as me but I take opiates everyday now, normally oxycodone with hydrocodone and I am honestly completely happy with my life, I don't steal, or lie to get my drugs, I earn an honest living working as a assistant marine biologist as a local aquarium and I'm proud of the lifestyle I live now. Of course opiates aren't for everyone and they can ruin some people's lives. But this sub has taught me that being an opiate addict isn't always a death sentence, it's a lifestyle choice and some of us are completely happy with our lives :)




Sorry of this is a bit of a ramble but I really wanted to show my appreciate to everyone here, your stories and pictures have given me many laughs and helped me through many hard times.


I would also like to give a shout out to a couple users on here who I see CONSTANTLY helping others and just all around improving this subreddit; /u/fat_loser_junkie        /u/heroinking    /u/Orange_Uncle_Monkey   /u/OxyJay   /u/Peer_Pressure-er


Thanks for making this place great and listening to my ramble! These fuckers should be mods ;)



Anyways happy nodding everyone and have a great day! :)





EDIT: I know there's tons of other people who also help this sub and comment all the time but these people are the ones I could think of off the top of my head, so is I missed you I apologize!

I started out with pain (and the pain is still there, the opioids just don't control it nearly as well anymore) and I'll probably need something for that for life. That's not what I'm talking about though. It's the recreational side, the side of making life a little more bright. 

Don't get me wrong, I've seen the bad. I know it's not ""glamorous."" I've been sick. Dropped from 75mcg/h fentanyl to nothing for a tolerance break. It sucks, but it's not the end of the world. The sickness doesn't bother me nearly as much as the crushing pain of being sober.

My first 2 dope connects ended up being scumbags and in my attempt to quit I decided to lose their numbers just to make sure I would never have to deal with them again. Later on however, I got a number from my buddy that ended up turning me back onto the day to day grind. It was good, he was always on, and I waited no more than 10 minutes on him at any given time. And he dropped his price after only a week of consistent business. This worked out until a couple weeks ago, when I got an 8 ball of his low grade and found it was heavily cut with antihistamine, leaving next to no room for actual heroin. I took it on family vacation and ran out 2 days early. Needless to say I was taken aback, I couldn't even conserve my stash because of how much I had to use to fix. Since then it's been all down hill. This past week he's been unreachable, until today I got a hold of his brother and grabbed a little something, $150 g shit, and it's garbage. Cut with Benadryl or something again. Unsmokable, wet, and has a strong chemical burn when snorted. I don't think ill be fucking with him any time soon.

Luckily (sort of,) I came upon 2 new guys recently too. I tried their shit, which rotates a lot as far as batches go, and varied a lot in quality. Nothing's been all that great so far. In fact, I ran into more unsmokable, near completely impure, diphenhydramine ""enhanced"" shit. Dirty and ineffective seems to be the word of the day everywhere I look right now. And everyone who refers me to these people say its fire. Fucking idiots don't know what their buying. And I take their word for it and pay top dollar to give the shit a taste. Dissappointment every time.

I just want a good solid connect again. Whose product won't change, and is priced according to quality. I don't mind paying extra for good shit. And I'm sure this is a ""no shit"" statement and we all share this sentiment, but what the fuck? What is going on? Does anyone think this sort of thing happens in waves and that spells of shit quality brown are normal? There's got to be somebody out there with real dope, I just wish it wasn't so hard to find.

**Saviorself**


Dark have been my dreams of late, and few have been my friends

But comfortably the fiend relates, For the sinners have their dins

In my realm I swim gracefully, how sharp I keep my fins

In a God’s helm I think Faithfully, how to do it all again

“There’s a hole in daddy’s arm, where all the money goes”

But that does little in the way of charm, for the broken poet’s prose

He searches daily for a magic fount, from which magic potion flows

And balancing his own account, he assuages all his woes


But woe indeed this man who needs -I guess- to buy his happiness

But don’t we all in our own way bleed, and seek to kill that stress

Distain in eyes and painful lies, follows him even at his best

But damn them all, the junkie dies, following his own quest


I’m sorry if you disagree, with my method or with my mind

I’d let you all be free of me, the worst that you could find

But honestly, the honest me, has some concepts to remind

If you think that the rest are free, then you, like them, are blind


Because what are we friend, if not moles tunneling the earth

You say your will would never bend, but what’s that even worth

Even if you were born a king, to rule the air, the land and surf

It’s shackles that you wear, sad thing, a slave from very birth

I, sadly, was born with eyes, to see what some refuse

I, madly, seek to devise, a way to skip the damning dues

But we’re due to suffer needlessly, as our bodies are torn and used

Until death descends egregiously, Afraid, and quite confused

So, dear decider, what’s the harm, in seeking some relief

The pain denier, don’t be alarmed, the needle prick is brief

Different paths we choose to walk, we swim in different reef

But choose your words when next you speak, Go friend, find your own grief

My grief will be that of my own, and so will the means to my ends

Though it’s no relief to stand alone, and it’s true that my will bends

But if ever you undid my wrongs, without pause, I’d do them all again

Dark have been my dreams of late, and few have been my friends

(sorry about the methamphetamine fueled ramble),"BTH first started coming to my area in the southeast US about 9 months ago.  compared to the hit and miss ECP i've been fucking with for 10 years, this shit was pretty top notch, but hard to find.  at least it was until a good old friend hooked me up with this really awesome dboy with whom i share a first name, which is fun.  he also lived in the suburbs, doesn't fuck around with times(30 minutes is 30 minutes and 2 hours is 2 hours. 95% of the time), and his dope was usually quality gear.  Every once in a while he'd have to resort to getting some of the shitty local ECP just to tide the customers over between the amazing tar he pretty consistently supplied.

Usually i'd go hang at his place in the nice neighborhood but sometimes he'd have me meet him in hotel parking lots/hotel rooms where he would have like 8-12 people all crammed in there getting fucked up/fucking/whatever (lots of ice going around in this group, too.  what is it with black tar/ice dealers?  even on SR it's like that.)  It was usually pretty sketch and i'd be quick to leave unless there was promise of more dope.

So one night he calls me around 2 or 3 in the morning(another weird thing about tweaker dealers;  their hours are really different than most dealers i've had.  instead of 8am ish- 9pm ish this guys was more like 2pm ish -6am ish) and tells me he will give me a fat bag if i come to his hotel room with a gas can because his girlfriend's car had run out of gas.  fuck yea, i got me one o' dem!  

So i fly over to the hotel, let them borrow the gas tank and hit up my fat bag in the room while waiting on the gas can to return.  In the room with me and my dboy are about 5 pretty decent looking girls(they were on the verge of faces of meth though, they were probably pretty beautiful before the hardcore tweaking... whatever.  it ain't my place to judge them.  i like to throw a tiny shard into my shot every once in a while my self.  just saying.) and 3 or 4 dudes.  they were all pretty bro.  visors and tribal tats.  but strung the fuck out.  there was lots of obvious tension going on as i'm sure they had all been up for a few days and were all cranky and on the verge of psychosis and sick of being around each other.  I've noticed that about meth houses...

Anyways the shot is done, the gas can returned, and i go home to enjoy a peaceful sunrise.  As i recall it was part of my weekend(sun,mon) and i didn't have anything to do but enjoy my nods.  I eventually fell asleep, woke up, and needed more dope.  I go to call my buddy and get no answer.  by now it's 5 pm or so but him not answering is no biggie.  he'll call back or answer sometime in the next hour... only he doesn't.  ever.  4 days later i finally get to hear the story.

The night i brought him the gas tank, a few short hours after i left, everyone in the hotel room had passed out.  I guess they had run out of meth which i guess is another reason why tension was so high when i had been there earlier that morning.  For some retarded reason, lots of drug paraphernalia was left out in the open and for another even more retarded reason, no one hung a do not disturb sign on the door.  You know what happens next.  I lost my favorite hookup.  It was devastating.

You may have read my other two stories i've posted to this sub.  If not you should [read(1)](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1gzrcv/some_dumb_shit_just_overdosed_in_my_bedroom/) [them(2)](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1h9w4p/stupid_stupid_stupid/).  They're pretty hilarious and stupid if i do say so myself.  All this stuff happened shortly after the best dboy ever got busted.  No phone, No dope dealer at all.  Just the subs i get a couple times a week.  Enough to tide me over and keep me well, but i didn't really get high for nearly a month except for one package i got from SR that lasted me all of a day and a half(it was still fucking awesome though).  I was pretty proud of myself for getting back to chipping but i still talked to my one good friend(the guy who introduced me to the hotel room bandit) on fb chat and he told me soon he'd have a new connect.  I was excited but didn't get my hopes up too high.

Last night i get the call around 2 am.  We have a new dboy, he has some solid ECP, here's his number he's expecting your call.  I call him and we chat for a minute about our mutual friend and then get down to business.  ""so can you do 40?"" ""yea i got you man"" ""where you at?"" ""*apartment complex less than 2 miles from where i've been staying, in the suburbs, not in the fucking ghetto*"" ""ohfuckjesusyes!  i will be there in 2 minutes.""

1 minute and 15 seconds later i pull up in front of his building.  He and his girlfriend come outside to meet me, and of course, in this small city, his girlfriend and i used to work together in some restaurant or another.  We chat for a minute(i guess it was him making sure i'm cool) and he invites me upstairs into their apartment.  They seem like a nice couple and i'm expecting a quiet transaction and a nice little chat.  Not so.

We walk upstairs and into the apartment.  The setting is quite familiar.  It reminds me a lot of those tweaker hotel rooms where i used to hook up with my Black Tar Buddy.  I walk into the living room and look around the living room and who the fuck else do i see sitting on the couch?  MY FAVORITE FUCKING OUTLAW!  FUCK YES!

I walk straight to him and the first words out of his mouth are ""You been cheatin on me, ouch?"" We laugh and the guy who is supposed to be serving me gets a real nervous look on his face and invites me to come back into his room with his girlfriend.  I'm more interested in talking to **my** dude and getting his number.  It's pretty fucking obvious he's supplying the guy i just met.  Right off the fucking rip and i'm already going over my dude's head.  HA!  

But i'm a polite guy.  So i let new guy serve me.  It was legit and I was happy.  He invited me to chill and hangout with him and his girlfriend and i ain't got shit else to do at 4 in the morning so yea.  we chilled.  He whipped out a roxi, a twenty bag of ice(i don't know how that shit's weighed/sold.  2-4 times a year and ONLY. IF. IT'S. FREE!) and the last of his ECP... about .1.

Wanna throw this all one spoon and split it three ways?

Fuck yes sir.  Let's do that!

So we commence to jigglin.  Clenched jaws, talking incessantly, smoking incessantly, all with a mellow opi buzz keeping the edge off.  At one point during all this my favorite dealer ever comes in the room and says to me, in front of the new guy, ""You know he's gettin this shit from me, just get my new number and come straight to me from now on."" 

*awkward*

Of course, I give him my number and get his.  but hey, if one doesn't have it, maybe the other will?  one and a half dudes is better than no dudes, right?  

Ugh it's been nearly 24 hours since i did not that much meth and i'm still pretty high.  Rambly as fuck.  Also don't really feel like finishing this story because i'm feeling pretty spacy.  So here's a recap of the rest of it.

Went home to my girlfriend from new dude's apartment around 6am (work at 1030, but it's a short shift... whatevs).  Wake my girlfriend and sexually harass her for 2 or 3 hours(that shit was fun, and i came.  first time i ever had my prostate milked.  i reckon it's what girls feel when they squirt.  pretty fucking awesome.  pretty awesome fucking.)  One of my coworkers calls me an hour before my shift starts and asks me if i will go get him a box of 24 hour sudafed from wal mart(he fronted me a bunch of fentanyl patches a few months ago and i took forever to pay him back so i feel obligated, plus i was awake already so it was whatever.)  

Since I was geeked(i know this isn't /r/methamphetamines.  but hey, fuck you), I decided to ask the guy i was getting the box for if he'd give me a bump from his ""shake and bake"" after he made it.  ""no problem dude, i'll bring it in at 3 when i come in (which is right when i'm leaving).  So work went by super quick and i was super productive and since i work in a restaurant my user friends there were all making fun of me for being so obviously geeked out.  

I need more fucking dope, man.  I need to come down.  So i call both dudes(fav guy first, no answer.  new guy second ""come on over now!"") right before I leave work right after sudafed dude hands me a baggy with this wet, scary looking powder in it.  

I head back over to the apartment.  It's the exact same scene, but a little more tense than before.  People looked cranky and pissy.  God i couldn't imagine dealing with all the drama that goes on in a meth/crack house.  And of course bth dude is there, too.  ""why didn't you call me, man?"".... blah blah.

I hand new guy 40 bucks and literally watch him walk over to my dude and hand it to him and get the bags from him.  seriously, dude?  but it was quality, brought me down some.  but i'm still fucking soaring.  enough so that i decide to just give up the shake and bake wet meth i had received to new guy as a gift(later on he told me it was fire, oh well  i'm not interested in fire meth.  i'm interested in fire heroin.).   

I get back to my girlfriends and spend the next 6 hours cleaning.  Upon realizing i had wasted the best part of my buzz i call old dude up.  of. fucking. course. he's out.  2 hours.  he says.  2 hours later he calls.  ""this shit is fire. afghan.  blah blah"" whatever dude just serve it up.  I drive the few miles down the street to another apartment he's crashing in and cop a single bag.  I came home and did it.  I swear to god it was some of the best fucking dope i've touched around here in all my 10-12 years of fucking around.

that is what it's fucking about, folks.  I don't know how long he'll be back.  I may lose him again and it might be soon because he's obviously up to the same shit that got him busted.  

But i'm going to enjoy it while it lasts.

there's lots of meth in my town, man.  I wish there was lots of smack instead but oh well.  i'm gonna stick to my 2-4 times a year and only if it's free rule.  i've been awake for 37 hours straight now and the only sign of slowing was brought to me by that lovely lovely bag of powder.  fuck i want to go buy 5 more.  but i'm just going to drink some beer and eat a cheeseburger and go to sleep.  

tl;dr:  methamphetamine fueled rambles about a junkie and his favorite dope dealer reuniting and other things.  

if you read the whole thing, you fucking rock. this took me forever to write in between nods and zoning out and king of the hill.

i love you guys!

1iqktk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1iqktk/wrote_this_out_in_a_comment_thread_decided_it/,53,https://redd.it/1iqktk,Face_first,"Wrote this out in a comment thread, decided it needed its on post. ""The czarist experience I had coping in Baltimore"" Please share yours as well.","There are so many! This one is one of my favorites but I am not proud of it because its pretty fucked up, but hey we all do fucked up shit when were in the grips, am I right?

Me and my 2 friends were about 18, broke and in this midst of full blown heroin addiction. We were all sitting outside smoking and trying to figure out the score for the day. My one friend, we call him ""Marky"" had a brilliant Idea, an Ice Cream truck, and fully loaded up fridge with Ice Cream and a bad ass jingle that blared over the intercom was all sitting 10 years away from us in a garage. The kids house that we were hanging out at, who's name is ""Pancho"" for this story, his parent inherited the truck and used it on the weekends around the neighborhood to make the kiddy's happy. At first Puncho was saying ""Hell no...fuck that shit...my Dad will kill me...blah blah blah"" He also said ""I don't even know where the keys are."" So I said, lets just go in, see whats in it an look around.

Once we got into the truck, witch was roomy as shit l'd like to add, I noticed something, the keys, sitting right in the fucking ignition! Score. So as Pancho goes into his house to grab more smokes, me and Marky decide we are doing this shit, its hot as fuck out and we can slang the shit out of some Rocket Pop's. Pancho comes back out and me and Mark outline the plan for him. It was currently 10:00AM, by the time we get all the ice cream out of the freezers in the garage, gas up and get on 95 it would be around 11AM. We lived north of Baltimore, about 25-30 min away, but we were going to the west side so It was going to take a little longer, maybe 45 min. So we could expect to arrive in the city and start selling ice cream and pops at around 12pm, sell ice cream for about 3 hours or as long as it takes to get enough to fulfill out habits and then get back an hour before Pancho's parents return so we can make it look like the truck never left.

I'm guessing by this time Pancho is feeling the middle to late stage or withdraw, and says fuck it lets load up! OH YA ITS ON, WE FINNA SLANG SOME MAH'FUKIN SPIDERMAN POPS!

So we hit the road, 95 to 695 to Norther Parkway into the Jungle. We ride around until we find a small project building hit the tunes and drive around it 5 or 6 times....nothing, not one person. I had the bright Idea to put on some Lil John (it was the only CD in the truck) and play that instead of the ""Ice cream song"". So with the Master of Crunk ready to get Jiggy we head about 2 miles down the road, im not sure of the roads or neighborhood but it was rows and rows of houses. We crank up LJ and start to hit the strip slow....

SUCCESS!!! Kids start running out from there house 3 or 4 at a time, kids riding there bikes as fast as they could to get to the truck (I guess they don't see to many Ice cream trucks in the hood) It kinda made me happy to see all these happy faces waiting for Ice cream, but then I remember what the bottom line of this operation was, to get some Ma fuckin Herion.... So we sell 23 ice cream pops, witch equates to about 35 dollars. That's barely enough to get one of us well. We need at least $60 each to makes this trip worth while and then some gas money to put back in the truck, so at least like, $200.00. Fuck it was getting to look like this was a waist of time and resources...UNTIL my partner in crime Markey saves the day with an Ingenious Junky Idea.

When the kids on the bikes pulled up they all, everyone of them, left there bike at the back of the truck, atleast 15 to 20 bikes piled up last time. Markey's idea was for two of us to keep the little fuckers busy infront of the truck while the other guy opend the back door and throw all the bikes in a drives off! Holy shit, that was a crazy ass idea, but its only getting later so why the fuck not. We go over about 10 blocks to hopefully get all new kids, turn on YEA! OKKKKKKKKKKKK and it starts to look like ground hogs day. Me and Pancho are all fucking with the kids infront of the truck and Marky was humping bikes up into the back of the truck. Mind you these kids are ages 5 to 13 and there is not an adult in sight.... Makes sense. Soon as Marky says go, I jump into the drivers seat, Pancho slams shut the side door, Marky slams the back door and I gun it. That beast goes 0 to 60 in like 29 seconds so for the first couple of seconds I had kids pounding on the side of the truck, I was really beginning to think that they could push the truck over, I was also always the pussy in the group. So I had to keep gunning it thru a red light. As soon as we went thru the red light we all heard !PING! It was a fucking bullet whole thru the back of the truck!!! HOLY FUCK, I have no idea how Pancho explained that to his Parentals.

So there we are in the west side of Baltimore with I think 17 bikes in the back of our frekin' ICE CREAM TRUCK?!?!??!! Now it was time to unload them, but where. I wasnt trying to take them to a pawn shop, they were all in pretty rought condition. Again, Marky had a great Idea. He was pretty close, like he shot this shit with one of the D-boys on the west side, and he knows that they buy there toughts and look outs bikes. His idea was to run over to his corner, and ask if he wants to do a trade. Long story short, we take the bikes over to the East Side, Rose St. to be exact, meet up with a D-boy name Fatz and trade 13 bikes for 20 scramble pills(20 gel caps filled with Raw and quinine). The Quinine apparently give the D a stronger rush but the verdict is still out on that one. Also the scramble pills are really made for shooting, you can sort it but the white fluffy quinine mixed with the raw is really really nasty on the way down.

So there it is, one of the craziest story's of my use out in Body-More Murda-land. Be safe. What are your crazy come up/copping storys?

The links are at the end of the post.

I have free healthcare through the VA. I was medically discharged from the Marines because of a rare genetic skin disease on my foot which has no cure. My whole family has it. It can get gross. This has information on it: http://www.dermnetnz.org/scaly/diffuse-keratoderma.html

I was medically discharged because my feet were causing me a lot of pain due to cracks and bleeding. I've been seeing the same doctor for 3 years now. The only time he's ever prescribed me medicine was 90 600mg Ibuprofen pills from two years ago, of which I still have over half. I've been taking them this past week, but they haven't helped. The only time I've ever been prescribed painkillers was during wisdom teeth removal and a knee surgery.

I went from working 20 hours a week to working 48+ hours per week at a job where I walk an average of 10 miles per day. On top of that, I run 3 miles, 4 days per week. The extra time spent being on my feet is causing the pain --- not the running.

The pain is deep in my foot. It makes it difficult to walk. There is nothing I can do to make the skin condition on my foot better. The best I can do is use a pumice stone to shave the dry skin off, but the splits and cracks run deep and never disappear. Lotions and other recommended treatments only soften the skin temporarily and may help remove some of the callus, but not the cracks.

My mother gave me a few Hydrocodone pills the other day and they worked wonderfully. Obviously I enjoyed the feeling, but they actually made the pain go away while I was working. I need something like this. At the same time, I don't want to seem like I'm drug seeking. I'm very naive at this. If I tell him that I took Hydrocodone, and that it helped, would that hurt my efforts or help?

Any advice on how I can maximize my chances at getting a good pain killer?

Background story to help explain my question,"I will try to make this post as straightforward as possible without being overly emotional: I am not here to preach about not doing drugs or seek emotional support but if anyone has had a similar experience with overdose/suicide I would be grateful for their help. 

About three years ago I started a relationship with someone who I eventually learned was a heroin addict. It was not hard for him to hide this because I have never done opiates nor did I know anything about heroin at the time. After I realized what was going on I decided to stay in the relationship and help him as gently as I could. (I thought I was doing the right thing by accepting his flaws and not forcing him into recovery). 

Once I realized that he had a severe addiction, I used to come to this subreddit to try and understand his mindset and learn more about heroin than google could tell me. In the past year he had racked up a number of criminal charges and faced jail time again or possible deportation (He was born in Russia and came to America when he was 5 but never got citizenship). We decided it was time to try rehab again even though he had tried and failed more times than I can remember. We tried one place in OK, then several in Boston but he never made it past 3 o 4 days. The last place he went was in PA but about three nights ago I got a call from him saying he had left and begged his way to NY and needed money to get back to Boston. I would always give him money in situations like this but this time his mother had contacted me in advance saying to NOT give him money. We had never turned him down before but we thought it was the best because he would 100% spend the money on drugs like he always had and boston was an extremely dangerous city for him to be in because of his ability to constantly use. He finaly agreed to go back to PA but he never made it there and must have stayed in NY using drugs.

Last night I got a call from the police saying that my boyfriend had died from an overdose and was found dead in a bathroom. I was his emergency contact but not the next of kin so I could not get any more information from the hospital about exactly what happened other than he was DOA. I just don't understand how someone with his experience and tolerance could have overdosed.  He had been using heroin for 10 years and injecting for I think about 7 or 8. When I was with him in this past year he would use  about 4 to 6 of the gram sized bags a day plus some other little smaller bags. I think that the smaller ones may have been cocaine but he also injected them. (That is just what I know he was using, I think that it may have actually been more because he would meet people outside all night long). Also, the amount that he was using was extremely expensive and he had been cut off from everyone.

Basically I want to know how it could be possible for someone to overdose in that situation. I have been tormented by the thought that he might have intentionally killed himself - he was probably heading to jail, we were in a bad spot relationship wise, he was cut off, he had no where to go and right before he left for PA he off handedly said if he cant make it through rehab he was going to ""give up"". I know that I can never really know if he did something to kill himself or really did overdose but I just thought that someone might be able to give me an idea of how easy/difficult it would be for someone with his tolerance to accidentally overdose.

So, I have a credit card with plenty of room on it. I have a checking account with cash in it, too, but it's a joint account with my girlfriend..like the credit card. So, if I take cash out, she will want to know what for, and she knows all the obvious tricks. (Cash advance, western union).

She doesn't  knows I use currently, and yes I do feel shitty about that, but that's a discussion for another time. I'm on a bit of a run,  and I was planning on stopping tomorrow. Then, a restaurant I was supposed to interview at on Wednesday (which would've been enough time to go through my own personal hell and then hop over tip sub.........it usually takes a solid to days to  feel like a human being again.) called me at nine O'cock on Sunday night, right after I did my last shot, to ask if I can make it around four tomorrow.

I had been using some cash that I won at a casino..I've gone thru five hundred bucks in a week, which I feel terrible about. 

I wish you could just buy one of those visa cards that you can use at an ATM, but of course those are cash only. (Ever wonder why? It's so people like  me can't avoid the astronomical interest rates on cash advances.)

So, what would you guys do? It has to be something I can explain fairly easily. Like if I got the visa gift card, I could just say it was a friends birthday and I already mailed it out. Basically, whatever it is has to be something that I doesn't look like I did just to turn it it into cash.

A friend suggested getting a kindle or something, showing it to her, and saying it was a gift for a friend..and then sell it on crafts list.  The problem with that is that I only wanna get like fifty bucks worth, just enough to get thru the day.

So, two questions...1) anyone know some easy ways to get cash? And 2) what should I buy to sell on craigslist?",1374491898.0

What do I do?,"First a little background. Yesterday life fine. I have a lovley wife and a son - whom I love very much - in college (not really in college since I don't live in the US, but you get the point).

No one in out family has ever been doing very well in school, and neither did my son but he until yesterday I thought he did okay. However, now I don't know what to think.

Yesterday I was helping him doing some paperwork and went to his room to look for some bank papers. Instead I found a drawer full of what I think was heroin. I'm not sure on the excat drug but there was syringes and drugs.

This basiclly made my world fall apart. I smoked my fair share of marijuana in my youth but that it. I belive hard drugs are just as bad as any other parent without any exposiour to them would. Now I have honestly no idea what to do. This is obviously a huge violation of trust, but since it's such a serious thing I needed some time to think about how to react. Since I found serveral syringes I figured this has been going on for a while (If it was me I would be extremly carefull to get rid of all evidence for the first long period of time - it takes confidence to get sloppy). I went on a ""bussiness trip"" to the nearest hotel to think for some time. That's were I am now.

I think I read every single ""help, my kid is doing drugs"" page on the internet. A few hours ago I found this subreddit and have also read every single post for the last month of so.

What worries me the most is that most of you seem to like what you are doing and doesn't want to stop. I guess this means I have every reason to believe my son doesn't want to stop either.

I am obviously going to contact the local help centers for parents like me very soon but I would like to get your views on it as well. What do a confused dad like me do?

I obviously **do not want** my son do you these kinds of drugs. I have not talked to *anyone* yet - not even my wife. The reason for this is that she would definitly not be able to wait a few days thinking the situation through.

Som facts:

* My son is 20 years old
* He currently lives at home (for free) but are looking for his own place.

Again. I am devastated, sad, confused and angry. I read that some of you have been kicked out, and while I obviously do not want to be a part of this and support his habbits also have a hard time seing how kicking him out should help anything. Some of you have been pulled out of college and into rehab but it also seems like rehap is diffecult enough when you truly are motivated to quit - and pointless if you do not want to.

Otherwise, I think my girl is going to convince her to just stay there while we look into some sub clinics around the area. The bottom line is she wants to get help no matter what and is sick of the lifestyle.

I have no idea what's going to happen in terms of us being together. She might have to go back to CT for a bit but I don't know yet. She does want to get help so I'm going to support her the best I can, but I also don't know what's going to happen to me. I'm probably going to end up getting clean, or I'm just going to get worse especially if we split up. I don't want my family to know so I'm prob just going to have to stop cold turkey which I've done a couple of times. She however can't face the w/ds w/o help.

This girl literally is the love of my life and I plan on spending the rest of my life with her. We have both been there for each other during our darkest times and supported each other no matter what. She really refuses to separate regardless of what her family thinks. I don't want her to lose her family and really just want to help her be happy with herself. I'm even willing to get clean with her so she won't be around a negative environment when she's clean.

I don't steal anything from anyone, I have a good job that I perform well at, and I'm pretty certain that I'm a very nice and well-liked guy.

It's really a bummer that I have to have this ""dirty little secret,"" that I love heroin. I've been an addict on and off for 4 or 5 years and out of all my friends, I could count on hands the ones who know about my addiction.

And I say ""addiction,"" because yes- I am physically dependent on heroin to get through the day... but I also really just plain ol' like heroin, so truly I prefer the word the word ""habit.""

That's what it is to me. A habit. A hobby. I like getting high. It's fun. I'm not a bad person. But of course there are bad people who do this shit, and they give the rest of us a bad name, but even most of them wouldn't be so bad off if they didn't feel so rejected by society for chasing that feeling we all love so much. If we could just accept the fact that certain people are going to do drugs, and be addicted, and we as a society don't need to bed over backwards and accommodate them, nor do we need to do so in trying to stop it either. It's wasteful, hateful, harmful and ultimately futile. Every person deserves to be happy. I think a lot of the negative repercussions of drug addiction are caused by our society's view towards it. (Though obviously not all negative repercussions, and I don't mean to oversimplify as much as I seem to be)

Heroin should be legal. Imagine a world where heroin addicts could go live together on a commune somewhere and be cared for and work just for heroin and the most basic food, shelter, love and community they need. How many of you would work eight or even ten hours a day producing something just for that?  Why not?

Last Monday my mom and stepdad (with whom I've been living since my 6 week stint in rehab a few months ago) do a thorough search of my shit and find a spoon and a few rigs. A shitstorm ensued. I was kicked outta his house and had to go back to my old place we moved out of that has no furniture or tv or anything. I'd been outta state at school the last 5 years and my abrupt almost kidnapping to go to rehab ensured I lost all my shit at WVU. So, 3 days of withdrawal, sleeping on a floor with no ac or anything, until I hid my paycheck and cashed it and got high Friday, mom called my workplace to see if I got paid, more shitstorm, then 3 more days of gut churning, leg raping withdraws until today. 

I left work early as I was sick, and my old white trash chick I've been copping from swings by and picks me up before she made her run to pick up. I give her my last
20 bucks, and tell her my story. This amazing bitch is giving me .4 of fire tar for 20 bucks!! Which is a deal where I'm from. And to top it off and tide me over, this toothless angel throws me her last 4 mg dillie and a rig for free, to get me right until she gets back from her run. The last week has been hell. But, that little pill, first dillie I've had in almost a year, floored me and enabled me to hold out for a few hours Til she gets back. This game sucks sometimes, I need to get out but I don't plan on it quite yet, and little things like this just seem to make the last week of hell almost seem worth it. You guys are the shit, too, by the way. This sub has kept me from losing my fucking mind a few times. Shine on you awesome fucking people. Sorry for rambling a bit, I'm high and actually happy today, you kids have fun out there.

About two weeks ago my old connect from like 3 years ago called me up out of nowhere and asks me for Norcos, but I couldnt find any, so I thought that was it.
The next day he calls back and tells me he can get 80mg Oxys and asks if I want to grab some. Now, I haven't seen those around in years (heroin chick now) so I tell him I'm good for as many as he can get. He tells me we're all set and that he'll call me the following Monday. I'm super excited at this point.
Monday comes and goes, and he starts pulling the whole ""tomorrow for sure, tomorrow for SURE!"" BS, and I assume he's full of crap. A week goes by. I console myself with a gram of tar from my regular guy.
Then this last Sunday he calls again and tells me that I can come down and see him anytime after noon Monday and he'll have them for SURE. Great! I can barely sleep because I'm so excited..
Naturally, Monday morning arrives and I get about 7 texts from him explaining some BS story, and of course he can't come through. 
So at this point I make peace with the fact that I'm not getting my Oxys. By that point I'm pretty much over it, and THEN I get ""the call"". On Tuesday around 10am he calls and tells me to head down at 12 and we can pick them up. I'm there on the dot and he lags 4 HOURS! I was so annoyed.. I had to sit and wait for four hours in Los Angeles traffic like a moron, waiting for his call. I was really worried that he was going to flake on me. You know that awful feeling..
FINALLY I get a text from him. It simply reads: ""I got em"". YAAY. After that it was 10 minutes of yip-yap to catch up on each others lives and a 20 minute drive home. 
Now I have a nice handful of 80s and smile. 
So sorry for the wall of text- I had to tell someone <3

This is my first post on this forum and really first post in general. I lurked reddit for a while created an account and never did much but upvote and browse untill now. My favorite subreddit would have to be you guys i feel such good energy, there is incredible positive reinforcement, and help, and most of all a place to go when no one else is there. With that being said ive mustered up the courage to post about my life as of lately.

After starting at heroin at 14 i used untill now, im 18 now, yes im still young. i remained a sort of functioning addict which does not say much. I managed to graduate high school and fuck my first year at college up losing my financial aid. However i have been employed since fifteen to support my habit. 

 Towards the end of my 4 year run i was once again confronted by my parents for missing jewelry, i lied (even though i knew i was fucked), parents searched room found my needles, dope, spoons, everything. Basically thats was it for them like most parents. I was forced to give them the keys to my car, or the police were going to be involved, i already had problems with that so i could not go again, i had to give them my wallet as well as my cell phone, all of which i pay for, and they kicked me out. I stayed with my dealer for 2 days  and got high and just didnt have to worry about anything (hes a good friend so i didnt have to pay) .  

 I had one more day off and then i knew i had to work but didn't know what time. I used my guys phone to call,  when i called my manager said i had been terminated because my father called them and told them i was doing heroin and drug use is grounds for termination (since he said i used on the clock..... which is true im am addict fuck lol.). So at this point i had basically lost the most important thing (not my family of course, funny how i think as an addict) my cash flow. 

I basically looked around and said ...fuuuuuuuuuucccccckkkkk.... and just about broke down. Not quite ready to accept rock bottom but realizing i had hit a pretty deep low i spent the next day doing a mass of different drugs; coke, meth, and heroin of course. As i was coming down i knew i had to stop, i told my friend and he said i could stay and detox but i knew that wouldnt work seeing as it would be 5 feet in front of me at all times. I didnt quite know what to do at this point so i called the only person i knew who might help my grandma. I prayed she would answer as it was was ringing. She picked up and i explained to her what happened, by the grace of my higher power she told me if i promise to clean up and didnt bring any shit up to her house i could come live with her to detox, about 30 miled outside my town.I agreed and for about the next 2 weeks i endured the most grueling physical withdrawals that i never hoped i would have had to deal with. You all know about that i know some have been using a lot longer than me :] . 

After about 8 days my grandma offered me to go to NA and told me that one of my moms friends ( she was into NA for a long time, no longer goes but is still clean) had called her and told her i should really go. I was still pretty out of it and still could not sit for an hour without needing to hit the bathroom i decided not to go. At ten days my grandma told me we were going somewhere, i didnt really have any other choice and said ok and crawled into her car and she drove me into town and sure enough to an NA meeting. I went into the rooms extremely nervous and was welcomed by everyone in there with hugs and greetings, telling me i had found the right place, it really was an incredible experience i was not used to hearing anything like that in a long time.  During the meeting i listened to a lot of different people sharing similar stories specifically some people my age and people 50 years older with the same situations. It was an incredible experience for me. I have never been a strong beleiver of a 'god' but i do beleive in a higher power or much but ive opened up to the idea lately which was hard for me. Anyway i started reading the book and working my stepss and i accumulated 20 days of clean time and have just been starting to feel a bit better. 

Recently some old friends contacted me online (found out my grandmas wii u has internet since i have no acess to computers) and  somehow they had heard about what happened, they asked how i was doing and i dont know why but i told them i just wantedto get high. They offered to drive to me and help me out but i said not that day because i was scared my grandma would find out and i was actually proud of my 20 days. The next day i logged on here for the first time in 20 days and started reading countless posts, drooling over some, and sad about others. I made it three more days doing meetings and just looking at posts trying to decide what i wanted and ultimately messaged a friend and said to come up that night, he agreed but ended up falling through half an hour before henwas supposed to show up leading to some massive anxiety, depression, and restlessness i did not fall asleep at all. I still have a very hard time sleeping since kicking. 

This brings us to today day 24 i woke up amnd messaged my friend asking to meet up during the day he agreed and i went to my 12 o clock i got out at 1 and and home at 1:30. I Messaged him amd he ssaid he was right up the street i wasnt sure what to say to my grandma since i basically have no freedoms here, i ended up asking to go for a walk she was suspicious but agreed. Bingo. I ran out the house up the street and sure enough he was parked there. I jumped in the car greeted and handed .2 of some fire BTH on some foil (he refused to bring me needles) I smoked it all and was so fucking high i practically was right back on that old cloud nine, i nodded out amd had forgotten what time it was, i had been gone about two hours . i told him i had to go i hadbeen gone an hour more than she said and i knew shed be pissed, he understood and gave me 5 instant pink tens for coming down WOOOOO!  I ran back to the house and to my suprise she wasnt mad at all i went to my room and nodded in and out all day. 

At around6 o clock my grandma was going up to the lake for the night with her friends she came in i would be with my grandpa only and to make dinner for myself, i barely heard her as i was so high and just agreed. I checked checked my messages and my guy had messaged me saying some friends wanted to hang out and they would come tngt i agreed aand just told myself i would walk out the fron door when he fell asleep. i waited till about 9 my guy messaged me same spot and my grandpa was asleep. Ran up the street to be greeted by three friends missed like hell tbey brought a two foot bong and a half gram of BTH we smoked 2 grams of some Fire and split the H as well as sniffing 2 pink oxy tens. We hung out for a little got me super high and sneaked back inside. 

I got back to my room and immediately knew what i needed to do, i needed to tell you guys my story. I am sorry for the long post and any grammar or spelling mistakes i am on my grandmas wii u. If you read the whole thing thank you very much honestly i just wanted to say how god damn high i am and how good it fucking feels. i am not sure what i will do moving forward now but im going to try and not do this tomorrow. i will still be going NA and listening to the other members but im not going to share this. I love all of you fell bropiates and i guess bropiettes ? if thats right. I hope my story will help some or just touch you guys in someway (;]) but seriously i could use some replies from this great community. -M_sweezy

It inspired me to get very high and write a rap song about it.

I also have been listening to a lot of Eminem lately, who I actually like a lot despite liking no other rap and the only other music I like really being Simon and Garfunkel and Nirvana.

So, anyway, the situation - and how high I got afterwards - inspired me to write my very first ""rap.""

It has a really weird flow, and uses slant rhymes, so to those who don't really know either poetry or rap, it may not even look like it rhymes or makes sense structurally, but it does if you do it right. (not to toot my own horn. Just sayin...) 

It's only one rapid-fire verse that theoretically would be led into by a chorus, which I have not come up with. But if there are any other wordsmiths out there, we should totally crowdsource this shit, and maybe you guys could ad your own verses and we could all put it to a beat. But, also, I'm really high, so that's just maybe silly talk.

Anyway, I call it ""*sunset cop*""

So, without further adieu... **BEGIN RAP:**


I placed a call to my dude/ to let him know what was up
and that the shit that I got earlier/ just wasn't enough

he don't answer, though/ so I am pretty much fucked
'less I can get to the spot/ before the sun isn't up

racin' outta work/ cuz I hate coppin' at dusk
I place my foot on the gas/ soon as I hopped in the truck

I went as fast I could, quickly/ try'na get to the hood
baby, before I get sickly/ gotta get myself good

I pull to Lander and Campbell,
park it and stand at a standstill,

hopin' they notice this white boy
and baby, they sure do damn well

I can tell

These brothers must think it's weird
to see a cracker roun' here

but they just check, coast is clear

signal over to dude,
He says just pull back aroun' here
be there as soon as my car can

an' I smack 'er in gear

then I pull up the block
to where the dude is just hangin'
an' he's from whom I'ma cop

Takes the cash an' say ""here,""

an' my dude makes the drop
No bullshit or haranguein'
must not assume I'm a cop

Mission accomplished
now I'm ready to leave
pull out I'm hopin' it's bomb shit
either way I'm relieved

get to the corner an' kiss it
tell it how much I missed it
I see myself in the mirror
an' just realize I'm a dipshit

I sniff it

Like I could somehow smell through em
In their white little baggies each labeled ""hotel room""

Want it to bad I could taste it
I'm racin' home ta get wasted
so I could rhyme in your face shit
tasteless as a pic on [r/spacedicks](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacedicks)

figured I got what I copped
from the spot
time to see if this shit hit or not

I just say screw it and do it
lay out five in a line
try'na get high on dope
I need it so bad I just
I'm hopin I can do it

Hope to tingle
roll that last single I got,
to let it mingle with snot
in one nostril,
the other side my finger will clot,

door is shut
in the bathroom
suck it up
like vacuum
soon as I feel it like ""what""
I just lay back and just laugh dude

now, man, it wasn't the best
but I ain't got no regrets

I just go back to my bedroom
time to take li'l rest

Pop open the laptop
lay it right on my chest

Open up a new word doc,
baby you know the rest...

Yesterday I came into possession of a couple of opiates. Some 7.5 mg pills and a bottle of Tussionex. Here are my questions:

-I took three of the pills(22.5 mg) last night. I doubt it made me develop even the slightest tolerance, but is there any amount of time i should wait so that the next time is just as great?

-The bottle of Tussionex was filled in 2007, and expired in 2008. I got it for free, so im not going to be mad if its bad or anything. But should this stuff still work?

-Whats a good dose for the Tussionex? The bottle says ""Tussionex Pennkinetic Susp MPI"" with a quantity listing of 60. It just says ""Take 1 teaspoon every twelve hours as needed for cough"". There are no other measurements.

Before that I was prescribed and subsequently addicted to xanax. Once I realized I was addicted to benzos and got myself through WD's with multiple seizures, I checked myself in to a 28 day program.

I thought that I had kicked the urge for all drugs, But within three months I had picked up heroin, which developed in to a daily habit that I've been feeding for about a year.

I came clean to my parents a few days ago and told them I needed to do *something* about it. I kicked the idea around about doing rehab again, but decided against it for a couple reasons. I'm not going to go in to that unless anyone is really interested in why I don't think rehab is the right choice, which brings me to the main point of this post.

Starting a week from tomorrow, I will be living and working on an organic farm for 6 months. I will get room, board, food, and a $100 a week stipend. The farm I am going to is totally isolated  and I won't have a car or any other mode of transportation.

I think that manual labor, learning about organic processes, interacting with a lot of different types of animals and taking care of them is the best thing I can do to turn the corner in my life, and finally tackle this thing. I'm pretty scared, and I know the first couple weeks are going to be very hard physically and psychologically.

Has anyone here every done anything like this in lieu of a rehab program? What about other alternatives that have worked for you?

I read and reread guides on the proper way to get high via my bhole while waiting anxious and dope sick for my old lady to leave. Finally she did, and I got to it. 5 ml of water and .3 g of #4 in a shot glass. Sucked up the murky drink and violated myself. Not comfortable. And I waited. On my side. And waited. Absolutely nothing. 10 minutes went by. Maybe it just needed more time. Still nothing. After a half hour I got up, sickness amplified now by soul crushing frustration.

So here I am. Still sick. I have .2 left for the morning and am doing everything in my power to avoid blowing it tonight. What went wrong? I did everything I was told. Took a shit prior and everything. Did it leak out? I didn't feel it leak out. So what the fuck. I'm supposed to be blasted right now. DAE simply not have the ability to get high this way?

I made a post here not too long ago regarding some questions i had about two prescriptions i obtained recently. One of which was some Tussionex. I'd never heard of it before. I know hydrocodone is generally looked down upon being a weaker opiate(at least its not codeine!), but I try to use infrequently and only use the ""lower level"" chemicals due to a very addictive personality.

I was amazed at how thoroughly some of you answered my questions, and also how nice this sub is in general. Its a needed break from quite a few of the others I visit.

With the information you all supplied to me, I decided to consume 3 teaspoons(~10 mg per 5 ml) over the course of an hour in a drink someone recommended called a ""Suburban Speedball"", which was just Sprite, Redbull, and Tussionex. I am about to finish the last little bit of it and can already feel it slowly creeping upon me.

I just wanted to say how much i appreciated the replies i received, especially those with quality links. I may or may not update this with how I am doing, depending on whether or not anyone is interested. I also really enjoy having conversations with people when i am on opiates, so if anyone wants to talk, just say something! Haha.

There's been a lot of dope-related activity for me recently and at this moment I have literally no one IRL who I can release all this steam to. You guys are it, right now. 

So I was going to hook someone up today who lives a couple hours away from me (David, we'll say). My other friend (Sam, lets call him) was going to get a bundle from his guy and then David was going to pay him for it when he got here. But Sam was dicking around for hours, not sure if he was going to pick it up for David or not, so I couldn't tell David to make the 2 hour drive here if Sam wasn't going to get it. Sam was sketched out and couldn't decide whether to do it for a while and we talked back and forth about that. 

Then, a little while ago David says that it's too late to come and get it. No big deal--it's getting late, and it's a long drive here and back. I text Sam and tell him the deal is off. Sam asks me to see if David wants to pick it up tomorrow, because if he does then Sam will get it anyway. 

Here is the timeline: 

8:30-- I tell Sam that my friend isn't going to make the drive tonight, so he shouldn't get anything.

8:51--Sam texts and asks if he'll want to come up tomorrow for it. 

8:51-- Sam says ""I'm getting it now.""

8:53-- I ask David if he's coming up tomorrow, and he says no.

8:54--I text Sam and say that my friend can't get it tomorrow either.

9:10-- Sam calls me, yelling about how he now has an extra bundle that he spent all this money on and it's my fault because I didn't tell him not to get it. He said that I roped him into doing this and now he's out the money and he's really pissed off at me. 

He must have texted me as the money changed hands, because in my town there are no deals that take place within a 3 minute time period. He went ahead and got it without waiting for confirmation from me after I specifically told him that David wasn't going to get it tonight--he assumed that he would come up tomorrow and didn't give me time to respond. And now I'm the bad guy who dicked Sam around all night. 

What the fuck. I'm so angry right now. I hate not being able to talk sense to people. All he has to do is look at our texts and he'll see that he went ahead with something after I told him not to, but now he's mad at me and I'm not even getting to get high after all of this.

Thanx!,"TL;DR: need to use my credit card to get 700 cash..either through western union, which charges a 65 dollar fee, or via a cash advance, which would be around 23.9% interest. The other important factor is that if I go through W.U., I wouldn't have to pay interest on the 765 for six months. Thanx all you smarty pants!

So, I'm a little annoyed with my insurance company right now. Actually, not really, they gave me about six thousand over blue book value for a car that was recently totaled. They did fuck one thing up..I asked them to send it to my personal bank account instead of the joint account I share with my wifey so she wouldn't know how much they gave me.

Here's the issue: I already have a ""date"" set up with my dealer to pick up a ""Mexican quarter"" (6.2g) for five hundred tomorrow, and I'm getting an ounce of beasters for 200..so 700 total. I was just going to take it out at the ATM, but since that is no longer an option, I have to use a new (private) credit card I just got so wifey won't find out. I have a zero percent APR for the first six months with this card, but of course that doesn't apply to cash advances..with those you begin accruing interest immediately at an outrageous 23%. 

My other option is to western union the money to myself, but that will cost 65 bucks for same day pickup.

Assuming it takes me about four to six months to pay off the cash advance without wifey noticing, which works out to be the more economically find decision? 

This is slightly time sensitive..I am meeting my guy around 9 to 10 am tomorrow..so if you stumble upon this post and can figure it out, I'd really appreciate it. I think I must've been baked the day they explained how to calculate interest in high school.

I only do 2-5 shots a day right now. Ill usually go through my supply in 2-3 shots during any given day, and then in the morning, when I wake up, I'll do the leftover cottons from the day before. It's a dirty hit, but it will usually buy me from 2-5 hrs. This morning I followed my normal routine. I hit the cephalic vein every time. Right now my right cephalic is closed(or as I call it ""under construction"") entirely, at the crutch(crook of the arm). My left is open, but is also simultaneously collapsed; however, I can hit the top side of the closed tunnel, if you will. I was hitting the right side forever too, but it finally closed.

Now, I try to rotate as much as humanly possible, but unless I have someone help me(like my fiance, who, as a a body piercer, is a fucking dead-on shot). So 9/10 out of 10 I'll fix myself. 

Anyhow, I started at my left ""crutch"" in the crook of my left arm, and since I'm trying to minimize damage, I've chased the thing all the way up my arm. So far, the track is only a little over two inches and right now, my latest injection site is maybe used 3 times a day at most. Right now it's sitting right on top of my left bicep. I can hit it first try every time(cuz Im cool like that), but usually if it's fully collapsed, no amount of registering draws anything. So right now it's open, and I plan on doing a shot again in about an hour, but just about 2 hrs ago I noticed that the skin near the injection site is warm, red, and very taut. I know this is a sign of infection, but could it also be a sign of a future abscess? I've been at this for only a few weeks now, after taking off over 3 and a half years, so there's a lot I could be forgetting. I never had an abscess before, and hopefully never will, but is this a harbinger of an abscess to come? Could it be the dirty cotton hit I did this morning? Maybe yesterdays or the day before's?  About 4 days ago the BTH I was getting was the dirtiest I've ever received(boys), but 3 days ago it changed again and was miraculously clean, so I don't know what the fuck do think.

I wasn't getting enough pain relief taking them orally like I had been for almost three years, but my Doctor doesn't want to up my dosage due to my ""age"" (30). I don't really have any other options for Pain Clinic Doctors and I know I'm lucky that I'm getting what I am from reading so many horror stories from Chronic Pain patients.

So I read about snorting Opana and I decided to start doing just that about six months ago. The first three months I could get away with only taking about 3 Opana IR 10s instead of 4 per day, but after that point I needed to take all 4 per day again. Now I'm starting to run into various problems with snorting.

Snorting that much filler over such a long period of time on an every single day basis has really started to clog my nasal passages despite my incessant cleaning of them. I use a neti-pot once or twice a day and I use saline nasal spray about ten minutes after each dosage. Still, I can tell that some of those back passages have filler residue stuck in them and it's affecting the bioavailability. **So my first question is: Do you have any other advice on cleaning the sinuses? Especially those hard to get at smaller passages around the sinuses?** Another thing I should mention is that instead of snorting lines I now cut a bendy soda straw so that both ends are the same length and then load that up with some crushed pill. I put one end in my nose and one in my mouth and blow the crushed pill in that way. I picked up this trick on this site around month two of snorting and it works much better than the normal snorting method for me.

I've also started to experiment with shooting up the Opana now, but I'm a complete drug noob (the only ever drug I ever did was to smoke pot about a dozen times in college). I acquired some 30 gauge 1ml Insulin needles from a diabetic friend (since in my state you can buy needles without a Rx, but you have to write your name and Drivers Lisence number in a register in order to do so). I followed various directions online that I found with regards to preparing Opana IR to shoot up (luckily it seems to be much, much easier to prepare than Opana ER). I screwed up the first couple times due to not letting the crushed powder sit in the distilled water long enough and although I got a mild opiate rush when injecting I completely didn't understand why people say they love shooting up Opana so much. The last two times I let the solution/powder sit for about twenty minutes before filtering and shooting it and I got a *much* greater opiate feeling. Still, it wasn't this crazy feeling that people claim they get from shooting Opana so I feel I must still be doing something wrong.

So here is my current method:

I have two shotglasses, a small stainless steel container with a tight lid that I found that holds about 10ml, 30 gauge 1ml Insulin needles, a larger syringe (3ml), and some dental cotton balls.

I put some distilled water in one of the shotglasses and heat it up in the microwave till it's steaming hot. I already have the pill crushed up quite well into powder (I've gotten quite good at this and have several devices to help out and I'm getting really good powder so that certainly isn't the problem). I use my 3ml syringe to pull out 1 or 2 ml of water (1 if I'm mixing in half a 10mg pill, 2 if I'm mixing in a whole 10mg pill) and put it in the stainless steel container. I add the powder and close the lid. I twirl it around for awhile and let it sit for about 20 minutes with occasional twirling. I take about 0.3ml of additional water in a syringe and squirt it down the sides of the stainless steel container to get anything that stuck on the walls.

I take some of the dental cotton and break off a smaller piece and dip it in the microwaved water from the shotglass to get it saturated first. Then I stick it in the stainless steel container. I take my 3ml Syringe, stick it into the cotton, and slowly filter out the liquid and then put it in the second shotglass. Usually I only filter once. I then load up one or two Insulin syringes with that and inject it (which I also screwed up early, but haven't the last two times).

**So my second question is: What, if anything, am I doing wrong with preparing Opana IR for shooting up? Should I be applying more heat than just heating up the water beforehand? Should I be using room temperature water? Am I losing alot of the drug in the cotton and I really need to get one of those Micron filters?**

**My last question is: I've read that the halflife for Opana is actually slightly higher when snorting than when taken orally, but that the halflife when injected is less than when taken orally. How true are these statements and can anyone take an educated guess as to how much the halflife is changed by snorting and shooting?**

a lot of people like to shit on IV bupe, either suboxone or subutuex, because they associated IV highs with better rushes (dilaudid, dope, morph).  theres been multiple threads on benedryl loading (oral or IVd), but i believe the best potentiatiors in terms of bupe patients who are longing for a buzz but do not want to relapse into other opiates would be promethazine.  benzos are preferable but have their own demons.

i get scripted promethazine for nausea and i have taken 250 mg 30 min prior to a 6 mg shot of asuboxone pill and experienced a high more along the lines of a solid 2-3 bag of ECP.  not the pinz n needlez, but a drawn out rush that didnt start for a minute but ended up lasting over 5 minutes and eventually i nodded out.

so for all you sub users who are tired of the monotony and tend to IV yours, search for promethazine as a potentiator if the benzos are harder to obtain.  a lot better than eating 10 benedryl or trying to get those to fit in a rig, although the benedryl def does potentiate but not as well",1374868941.0

So I recently had the good fortune of coming across five 100mcg/hr fentanyl patches manufactured by Watson, meaning that one can smoke the gel contained within the patch. Now, I recognize how dangerous fentanyl is, so I'd much rather sell these things to someone that knows what they're doing with them as opposed to consuming them myself. I smoked very, very small dabs of the gel this morning and felt good, but in my view the risks are not worth the rewards. 

So, my question is, how much would one of these 100mcg/hr patches run over on the west coast? Any help would be very much appreciated.

I've been twice now. I'm an all around addict-alcoholic but my drug of choice is opiates. I had developed a pretty bad habit, spending every penny on oxymorphone and oxycodone, fucking up friendships and my life in general. So with the help of my family, I decided to give rehab a shot. My first one was a fucked up old school ghetto ""behavior modification"" type place. It was made to make money off the clients, keep you in there and paying them a long as possible. It was an ""inmates running the prison"" type thing too. I got to be the van driver after a month. It got me out of groups, which we had alllll day long, and it was nice to just get out of the house. I spent 6 months there before getting kicked out for getting drunk after I got off work. That was my first rehab experience. I met my best friend there, and we thought of making a ""The Office"" type sitcom based on our experience, and call it Serenity Granted, a play on the Serenity Prayer. That's where I get my username. 


After getting kicked out, I spent the next few months homeless, being an alcoholic. Finally broke down and called my Mom to come save my butt. Spent a month with her andher boyfriend. They had hydro and oxy in the house, and being the addict I am I ended up stealing pills. Got kicked out, spent a few more weeks homeless. Talked to my Mom about getting back into rehab. I didn't want to go back to the first place, so after reading up on a few other places, I decided on the one I thought would be best. This was a 30 day inpatient place, followed by intensive outpatient if you wanted to continue the program. This place was better, more of a classroom type setting and my councilor was awesome. I learned a lot in those 30 days. I went on to the IOP phase of the program. Relapsed within the first month I was there. Eventually I got caught drinking, left and went to stay at a homeless shelter with my best friend who I had meet at the first rehab.


It was good for me. I like the recovery scene, lot of good people that give me hope that one day I can get clean. But for now, I want to get high. I'll go to an AA or NA meeting occasionally still. I stayed sober for about 3 months during my stay at the first place. That's the longest I've been clean since I was 16. I'm 28 now. I may give rehab another shot but I kinda feel like I've learned all I can about the 12 Steps and recovery in general. If I want to get clean I just need to attend meetings and get a sponsor.


Tl;dr: Been to rehab twice, glad I went but it didn't keep me sober for long but that's my fault. It works I'd you work it, believe that. ",1374978066.0

I have noticed when you heat it up in water with not enough acid or none at all; when the mixture cools the solution starts to look like water just before it turns to ice....kind of 'slushy'


I'm actually kind of freaked out. I decided to do another shot and found the cooker and filter I had used earlier. 

I decided to re use them as they both had lots of residue and were like 45 minutes old. After cooking it up I dropped the filter in. I was having some trouble drawing up so I looked at the filter and was clearly gooped up with partially dissolved heroin.

Now that I think of it when I did that first shot I knew something wasn't right. I had a very strange in my stomach and throat. Almost like nausea but more intense. I've never felt anything like it.
Also I have done a few shots afterwards ad I have been getting intense pins and needles in my hands mainly my right

I'm not one to worry but goddamn I'm a little concerned. What are my potential scenarios?

TL;DR Injected Heroin #3 that wasn't dissolved. Am I gonna die? lol


Now I am wondering what would happen if I heated the Heroin #3, water, and not enough acid and then injected it while still hot, not giving it enough time to solidify....

I have a lot of prior experience with opiates, starting with pills in high school then eventually moving on to black tar. At the height of my addiction I was injecting multiple grams a day and quickly burning through the thousands of dollars I had saved at my high paying job. Then, in one of many time of sickness because the dealer man was temporarily out of stock, I said fuck it and bailed on that job, probably the worst decision of my life. HEROIN is a hell of a drug, I used cocaine and got drunk practically every day for long stretches of time and it didn't have nearly the impact that several solid months of dope usage did on me.

Enough of my sob story, I'm high as a kite and rambling. I went ahead and converted some cash, placed a 10 bag order with Maestro, and a couple days later had 14 bags of ECP in my pocket. Unfortunately I haven't got any rigs yet, so up the nose it goes. Due to where I was living previously, I was paying more for tar that was good, but not nearly as good as this.  Being able to chop it up and snort is awesome, and no where near as painful as tar. I never really liked smoking either, no loss there.

Now I have a far shitier job in a place I hate, but I'm not gonna spend too much longer here; moving back ""home"" soon to try and get everything back on track. I love drugs too much to say I'm gonna quit them entirely, just gonna try and moderate my use.

I used to snort a very small amount of the orange subs and just nod off a few hours later. I never liked the sub very much. 

This feels similar. I snorted it. It is powder. Also it makes my tongue numb when I tasted it. My teeth are numb too. I keep doing more but I haven't even done half a bag yet. I'm just kinda gradually taking it slow. My hands shake after I snort it. Then my head feels kinda heavy. It doesn't particularly taste like anything but then again i'm not snorting for the drip. 

My pupils were still kinda normal sized. I think I should do more..but i'm scared. 

For anyone interested in the psychology of yours truly. I live in a large city, and simply have no friends. I bought some oxys a couple months ago and it felt like a hug, which I don't get very often anymore :( ... 

So, the oxys are dumb expensive, and I had access to this. I know I shouldn't have done this. I smoked reefer last night and said to myself NO NO NO NO do NOT DO THAT DO NOT TAKE THAT STEP ... but here I am, feeling a bit underwhelmed. Mostly tired. 

I guess I should just keep doing a bit more? Almost there it feels like but with a pill I just take half a 15 really and have a bit of a mood lift. 15 really makes me feel great. Never took an entire 30 before. I feel fiendish going back to the glass and straw every 30 minutes.

Stop at the end of the TL; DR if you don't feel like reading a novella.

TL; DR:  My dealer unwittingly sold me garbage on my largest drug purchase of my life-$500-and I'd like to ask him for some kind of reimbursement.  Is there any tactful way to do this, or should I just grin and bear it?

So, I've got two hook-ups down here in ATX-one is a user herself, and it's always decent quality, and sometimes it's great (for tar). However, it's $50 for about .45, and she doesn't do any breaks on price, no matter how many get.

My other hook up is a real chill Mexican dude who has definitely never used. His stuff is usually pretty solid, he charges $10 a point (minimum order of $40), he delivers if you get $150 or more, and he gives pretty decent price breaks once you get over 3 grams. 

I recently decided to buy in bulk and try and make it last so I wouldn't always be stressing about my next fix. I spent $500 and he gave me a ""Mexican quarter""-6.2g.

The problem with him not being a user is that he genuinely has no idea how his product is if you're the first to pick up a new batch.  Also, he was  apparently pretty reckless when he was younger, so he did a fairly long stint in jail, and he's a daddy now-so to be safe, he generally only buys enough to get him through a couple of days at time so he's never sitting on serious quantity. 

He only had about .5 left when I asked for the quarter-so he went to one of his many suppliers (I'm assuming he just went through his phone and went to the first person who was up and ready to roll at 9am) and just got whatever he could.  When I picked it up, I specifically asked him ""how is this shit?"" and he said ""you tell me.""

So, I run upstairs, giddy with the excitement of having a hope diamond sized chunk of tar, and fixed up a pretty massive shot-probably about .5, which is .15 more than I usually do for a ""guaranteed rush"" shot. Amazingly, I registered first try, and threw the plunger down..and waited..and waited..nothing. OK, I thought, I did just take a sub 48 hours ago (but only 1.5mg)..it's probably blocking things up stairs.  So I patiently waited about 6 hours and fixed up a slightly smaller shot (.3).
This time, as is usually the case, it took me about 20 minutes to register, but when I finally saw the red, I took the plunge and..again, nothing.

Convinced the sub was ruining my fun, I put it aside for a while, went about my night, passed out-in all,  waited a full 12 hours before my next shot.  I woke up, in the beginning stages of WD, my sheets soaked in sweat, ready for that sweet relief..and again, nothing.  Sure, my sickness receded, but I felt 100% sober.

I needed some feedback to make sure it wasn't just me, so I visited my neighbor down the hall who I recently discovered enjoyed the occasional tar smoke session.  5 days before this, I had given her about .15 of the girls tar, and she smoked it over about half an hour-and was nodding for about 6 hours. (She only uses about 1-2 times a month, so her tolerance is fairly low.) So, I ask how much she'd like, only asking that she pays me back in dope when she can (I know she's good for it), and she asks for .5. 
I oblige, and she giddily goes about setting up her foil.  

She does a point..nothing. Another point..nothing. Maybe her tolerance had gone up a bit from the smoke session last week? We watch a few episodes of arrested development, then she breaks the remainder up and puts it on 3 seperate foils, and smokes em back to back to back....nothing.  Her eyes barely got pinned.

Finally, the nail in the coffin, I did a favor to the girl who hooked me up with this dude (who I met on a certain website I frequent) and throw her .5-she had a friend visiting from out of town so she couldn't make it down to our boy without arousing suspicion, but I lived close enough that she could get away with saying she had to drop something off at the post office, and she came through.  She's a heavy user, but she's also super thin, so she regularly nods off of .2 of our girl's stuff, or .3 of our boy's stuff. I told her it was fairly weak, so she fixes up a .4 shot, blasts off, and...nothing.

At this point I KNOW it's not just me-this stuff is garbage.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was under 5% dope.  It's hard as a rock, even after being left out on the counter for hours-I've heard that's a sign of a heavy lactose cut.

I hit up my dealer and let him know that this stuff is bunk, and that our mutual friend can confirm it.  I ask if he'd be willing to exchange what he gave me for equal weight (edit #2-equal weight of WHAT I HAVE LEFT, not of the whole quarter-I know that's asking too much!) of whatever he get's next, and to my surprise, he agrees.  The problem is, for once, he picked up a good amount.  Apparently, he had another large order for later that day that fell through.  So, he has no idea when he's going to re-up again.  

Meanwhile,my girl is dry, and says she's taking a couple of days off and won't be good til Monday (this is on saturday afternoon.) I'm going through a dry spell with veins, and I refused to poke myself dozens of times only to not feel shit, so I decide I'm going to either plug or smoke this shit to stay well until I can get something better.  The problem is, it's so weak, I had to smoke about .5 every 6 hours just to keep from getting sick.  I'm a huge pussy, and I hate w.d.'s...if I have dope, any dope, I'm going to do it instead of being sick. (The only reason I managed to go 12 hours the first day I had it is because I took a tamezepam at bedtime and slept for 10 hours.)

I  weighed out how much I have left last night around 11-.8! Now, I gave .5 to my friend from here, and probably about 1.2 to my friend down the hall, and they are both going to repay me with better quality gear. So, I really have about 2.5 left.  Still, that means I basically went through 3.7g from 6pm Friday to 11pm Sunday-that's 53 hours-meaning I went through .06 g an hour.  Usually, I can make a G of the girls stuff last 36 hours-or .02 an hour.  Using my algebra skills, that means that if I had spent my $500 on 4.5g of the girls stuff, it would've lasted me 225 hours. With my boys stuff, 6.2g would last me about 103 hours. That's a huge difference!

(On a side note, figuring out stuff like this is a great way to determine whether dropping a bunch of coin on uber potent, mega expensive silk road stuff is worth it-apparently it definitely is.)

 Regardless of how good of a deal I seemingly got, this was far and away the most I've ever spent if you calculate cost per high-especially because I never even caught a buzz!  Not a single rush, not a single nod. All it did for me was avoid the sickness.

Now, my dude is good on his word, so I'm betting he will replace the .8 I have left with something better.  But part of me wants to ask him for a little something else-maybe half a point on my next purchase.  It's not so much about the money, it's the principle of the matter.  I know for a fact he did not set out to rip me off on purpose-he doesn't even like touching the stuff, so I know he doesn't add cut himself-he buys it ready made.
But still, for all the good this shit did, I might as well have just chugged some headshop kratom.

Is there any diplomatic way to go about asking for this?  He definitely already knows I'm not happy with it, and my friend who introduced me to him (who has been buying from him for over 2 years and can count on one hand the number of times she's complained) also made it a point to text him and let him know that it was complete garbage and to steer clear of buying anymore.

Or should I just chalk it up to the game, and move on?  

I know it's just money, but 500 bills is a big chunk o change for me, and I can't help but actually cringe when I think of what I could've better spent it on-an amazing flat screen, pre-ordered a ps4 and some games, or hell, how about 2 grams of some fire silk road stuff!

If you made it this far, I hope you enjoyed my little saga, and I'd appreciate any input you have.

Edit- I know I was not clear about this at first, but I actually contacted my dude twice-once about an hour after pick up, to ask him if it was a new supplier, and to tell him it seemed weak.  I didn't tell him that it was for sure garbage until 2 other people who have zero bupe in their system confirmed it was worthless-because I was worried that perhaps the small amount of bupe in my system was ruining what could have been otherwise decent dope.  So no, I did not ""eat my entire meal and then complain there was a fly in my soup.""

Edit 2- Just to be super clear so y'all don't think I'm living in a fantasy world-I kind of phrased it wrong initially-I asked him if he would replace WHATEVER I HAVE LEFT WHEN HE RE-UPS with an equal amount. Of course I don't expect him to reimburse me for the whole quarter after I've done  put most of it in my dope tubes-that would be ridiculous.

This shit does not happen to me. Ever.

YAHTZEE motherfuckers.

Seriously the best things I've ever found before this were one or two dollar winning scratch offs that I'd pickup when I was homeless. Also I once picked up a business card for a pawnshop that looked like a hundred dollar bill. I was already planning how to spend it before i knew it was fake. Also found 4x$10 bags of crack wrapped in a sandwich bag. Turned out to be soap under furthet inspection and smell. Found a perc 10 along with nail clippers, a few pennies, and chapstick on the sidewalk. Guessing someone emptyed their pockets under pursuit. Found a roxy 30 in my couch while scrounging for change to get cigs. Low tolerance at the time allowed me to sell my brother a $5 bump for cig money and catch a nice buzz off the remaining quarter. Funny thing is i remember when I lost it, was buying an odd number of 30's. It was 17 or something for about $12.50 a pop and i dropped em after my dude had left. Thought I found em all at the time but the timing of finding that one was as clutch as possible.

But now I've already spent all the money and used all the drugs, can't be responsible with money you find (but I'm feeling damn good).

 I think we had a thread on this already but what kinda luck do you guys and gals have?
Are you the type to find money or drop money more ofter?  (I'm  sure most will say drop money but be honest, someone has to find all these lost bills)

And if you have found money, what's the most you ever came up on?

 (My old roommate found $180 outside of the food stamp office which is where he works. He also found an envelope containing 2 hundred something dollars outside his old job at a supermarket. Supposedly people were kicking it or just walking past it. Shit, if i see an envelope on the ground, I'm scooping it up, no matter how bummy it looks, but like I said earlier i used to pickup scratchoffs on the ground, even found some winners in 7-11 in the trash next to the lotto counter. It only had scratch offs in it. I draw the line at digging through real trash to *maybe* find a ticket and even more *maybe* win a buck.)

.

.

.

.
TL;DR

I found $50, and immediately blew it on dope. 

1. Have you ever found money? Do you find money or lose money more often? (Be honest)

2. What's the most you've found (money, valuables, drugs, or a combo)

3. Have you ever found money, valuables, and/or drugs and someone asks about it? How did you react? Finders keepers, or honesty is the best policy? Or is it situation dependent, IE not if its a friend or someone who 100% cannot afford to lose it?",1375065095.0

I took two different sized syringes that are used for administering medicine into the cats throats, they do not have needles but are pretty small so it should be comfy for my tight butt hole. 

I have watched people shoot up dope by mixing with water and drawing through cotton into syringe. Is it the same steps with plugging? Mix in a spoon, draw up the syringe with or without cotton? lay on side and let it sit in there for a bit before getting up?

How much d should I use> I typically will need .4 to get high by sniffing. Should I use that same amount or should i use less? I would prefer to only have to do it once then a couple times and I feel weird about putting water up my ass so how much water should I use? 

Sorry if this is post is one that is constantly being asked on the sub. Is this something I should just google? I prefer asking my br/opiates for advice than google. Anything else I need to know? ie. pluggin roxi 30's? someone already explained how to plug ops and ill post that in a comment. THanks dudes. I do not IV and this is why i want to get into plugging

Hell, even I enjoy a good *speedball* every now n' then, when I can afford it. But has anyone else tried doing a whip-it during/right after the rush from say, 16 mg's of intravenously administered hydromorphone? I feel like they work great together, as far as extending/increasing the head/body rush associated with the two. I never do whip-its by their lonesome, but together, I think it's perfect. Just thought I'd throw that out there, and share with you fellas/gals.
    

I love this combo, and always give it a shot when I find a can in the fridge...haha...I always get blamed when the cans don't work though, even if it's not me doing (I tell them to save the empties, but they always forget, and ask me why...""oh come on, you *know* why...lol..."" I have jury duty in the morning so I've saved 4 mg's for when I get up, and have *just enough* gas to get there and back...priorities ya' know...lol.  (thought about skipping out, but in my county they've been cracking down on absent jurors, and don't want to risk a fine that I simply can't afford right now...ohhh, the joys of civic duty, and our *fair* and *just* judicial system....at least I'll get $15 dollars out of it...that I've already spent on the pill/s to keep me ""right"" for it...oh well...fuck it right? It's not like they're going to pick me anyways...)
    

But after 3 days of w/d's and feeling absolutely horrible, today the great occasion where I came up on a little cash and the man answered his phone...""Yeah, you got those? *yeah*, Yeah? You home? *Yeah bro*, Alright, I'll be there in 15 minutes. *just watch out for cops in the parking lot, and the maintenance man, he's been getting a little nosy lately*, Yeah man, I hear ya, *hangs up*""  
    

I love this little safe haven we've got here where we can talk to fellow users without the bullshit stigma and judgement associated with our lovely hobby/addiction. I'm a lifer, for sure...I've always thought about quitting, and have even taken a break on occasion...but what always brings me back is, ""Why the fuck *should* I quit"". It's the Bubba to my Gump, man! I've yet to come up with a good, solid reason why I should. So until that day comes, I'll enjoy every moment of my love for opiates. Hope you all are ""blessed"" and doing well today! No pain, no more w/d's, at least for tonight and tomorrow...I feel great!  
  
TL;DR Whip-its and Dilaudid are a great combo imo, and work great together. I love this subreddit.../r/opiates master-race ftw!  
  
EDIT: Just called the number they list for the automated system they gave me to call after 6pm the night before you're scheduled to report. It said I was released from my summons and no longer required to report. Maybe they read my post...lol They know!

In short, sourcing is naming your source or looking for a source for illegal, or hell, even legal drugs. 

This INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO:

Giving your dealers name. 

Asking for hookups in your city.

NAMING OR REVIEWING SILK ROAD VENDORS. I've seen a lot of this lately. Any posts or comments containing it will be removed. 

Naming the street where you cold copped.

Not only that, he keeps sending me these jokey texts, which is not out totally of the ordinary on a weekend night or something like that when he's partying but this was like a Tuesday afternoon or something random like that. So I meet him in a parking lot and he doesn't have his normal bindles weighed out, he just gives me my order in one bag he measures out right there. Plus, it looks way different and smells MUCH stronger then the usual stuff. So at this point I'm thinking ""hm, I should err on the side of caution and do a bit less than usual"" so I take a shot and all of a sudden ""FWOOOOSH"", my body starts tingling all over, ears go deaf, vision tunnels, all those ""pleasant"" side-effects that used to only happen in my very early days of shooting when I was going for the mad rush (I have since stopped going for really heavy rushes because it became almost impossible to get ti that level without using too much dope in addition to too many close calls with OD's). 

So not 10 minutes after I do this, i get a text from my dude saying ""oh shit man I forgot, I hadn't gotten home to cut this batch up, be careful you can grab some lactose if you want"".

But I'm worried that it won't come tomorrow, and if it doesn't, then I'll be really sick since I didn't dose today either. 

So please cross your fingers for me! Will update hopefully tomorrow. ",1375249912.0

I know the dangers of mixing Tramadol with SSRI's. However, I take Abilify daily, which is an antagonist at the 5-HT receptors (with the exception of only two subtypes, which it is a partial agoinist for). It also antagonizes the SERT transporter. Being said, is it safe to combine Tramadol with Abilify? I will only be taking around 150mg of Tramadol, as I have no tolerance to opiates. I also take Xanax daily, but I don't think it will interfere with my Tramadol dosage (I have a huge benzo tolerance).",1375245116.0

My job fucking sucks, I never thought I would be washing fucking dishes again at 27. If I had somewhere to go I would be out of here as soon as I got paid, but I think I'm pretty much out of options. I'm stuck here, and I'm stuck being clean. 

On the bright side, my sister is doing a lot better and should be out of the hospital any day now.",1375244195.0

Got any input?,"I tried posting this in the recovery thread but I need some replies besides ""go to a meeting!!""  I've been to rehab, outpatient, sober living...I'm not sure if getting sober is the answer for me.  I'm not scared of dying and that scares me.  My first thought (as selfish as it is) waking up and being told I was dead for 15 minutes was literally, ""that was an easy way to die"".  I don't remember not being able to breathe.  There was no pain until I was alive again.  After saying this I'd like to add I don't want to kill myself.


I fucked up I was sober for eight months. I started drinking very lightly and everything seemed fine. My boyfriend and me went to a bar with his friend and got really drunk and ended up doing some coke. I woke up the next morning and didn't remember but my boyfriend told me. I said it was whatever and we went to clean out the car and find a bag of heroin that his friend dropped and decided to smoke it. My boyfriend and me decided fuck it and shot it up. He did me first and gave me way too much and my face turned all blue. He got scared and drove me to the ER and on the way I died. I was dead for 15 minutes. I feel like shit now but I'm fine. I'm freaking out through. I can't even wrap my brain around the fact that I was dead for 15 minutes.


 Also sidebar my little sister overdosed and died a year ago. So I'm also coping with the fact that I can't understand why she would die and a fuck up like me is still walking around.",1375230766.0

My question is about dosing. My friends have about a zero tolerance, but I am a little more seasoned. Although this is my first time getting kooikie with the tea, I've dipped my nuts in some opiates before. Not a constant user, but have been known to handle a decent amount of oxy(30-50mg) doses. I know that's child's play to some of you veterans, but to me it's a pretty big dose. How could I make strong enough tea for me, yet ok for my buddies to try. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I was living in some sort of halfway house or something, I've never lived  in one so that's sort of weird. Everyone else that lived there left to go do something and left me behind. I was standing in the dark in a driveway and then my old best friend/kind of boyfriend that died from an OD appeared as a ghost. I was like.. holy shit, Austin!!! I just wanted to hang with my ghost friend all night. It felt sooo real. He lead me down a hallway of this house to a bathroom with a medicine cabinet full of soooo much methadone and suboxone. I drank a bunch of the methadone and we sit on a couch together. He gave me a pic of us that I had never seen. Then I nodded out on his chest.

In my dream, then I wake up, and I'm just hugging a pillow and holding some tarot card with a bull on it instead of the picture. Then I woke up in real life crying. 

Ahhh what the fuck. I'm so bummed. Does anyone else have ultra depressing dreams when they WD?",1375201769.0
