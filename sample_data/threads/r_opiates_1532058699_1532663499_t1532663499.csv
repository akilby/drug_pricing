I think I've found a way that doesn't involved chemistry and is almost free.

Now I know I will be laughed at, I have no idea of what to expect people to say to this post and idea. But here's the way I think about it: this method is much better than prostitution or stealing. So laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded, and I believe it to be far preferable to any of the other shit people do, less shameful, and more moral.

So here it is. tl;dr at the bottom.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I've been trying to find a way to make opiate use sustainable. If you could use 1/10 the amount of heroin you do now, then 1 gram that lasts you 5 days would instead last you 50 days. That takes something from completely unsustainable to very sustainable.

Now, traditional ways of using less don't really work. It's hard to reduce tolerance besides stopping using completely, any tolerance supplements usually just slow the growth of tolerance, they don't actually reduce it.

So I've been thinking hard about ways to increase the supply. Maybe you could make the half life longer? I researched that but realized it'd be too hard for the most part, there's so many enzymes and methods of excretion your body uses. But while reading about the metabolism of heroin/morphine, I found something quite interesting.

Over 90% of the heroin/morphine you inject is excreted renally (in the urine). So I looked at the metabolites.

60% of morphine/heroin is turned into morphine-6-glucuronide. 15% is turned into morphine-3-glucuronide. The other 15% in the urine is just normal morphine. The other 10% is shit out.

Just so you know, morphine-glucuronides are just morphine with a sugar molecule attached where the acetic acid is attached in heroin. The body does this so that the morphine becomes super water soluble and stays in the blood and can be filtered into the urine. Remember how sugar is super water soluble? Morphine glucuronides aren't like other metabolites. Most metabolites physically alter the actual drug and destroy it, this keeps morphine exactly how it is. Just like heroin can be turned easily back into morphine with no work, morphine-glucuronides can be turned back into morphine with no work either.

So I think you can see where I'm going with this. Yes, I am saying we should extract the morphine from our urine and re-use it.

Just think about it. Within the urine of a heroin addict is 90% of the morphine they just injected. It's extremely simple. You just boil it down, use a very easy to get enzyme that removes the glucuronides/use HCL to remove the glucuronides, and then use acids/bases/solvents to extract the morphine, then boil down until it's dry. All you have to do is turn the glucuronides into morphine, and the use PH to selectively remove the morphine. This is chemistry at it's simplest, using materials you can buy at Walmart, and it'd take less than an hour to do. Extremely simple, cheap, and fast.

Don't think the rewards would be big enough to justify it? Well look at these calculations:

Let's say you injected 200mg of pure heroin a day (sidenote, most heroin on the street is less than 25% actually heroin, most is less, meaning someone injecting a gram of bullshit street mix is actually only injecting about 200mg a day of actual heroin. Heroin is very strong, 200mg is a lot, most people here would need 100mg or less a day).

So let's say you inject 200mg of 100% pure heroin/diamorphine. If you used the urine alchemy method, you'd recover 180mg of said heroin, and would be able to reuse that. So if you used my method for all the urine you produced, you'd only be losing 20mg a day, instead of 200mg a day. (10% of 200 = 20).

Think about how powerful that'd be. At 200mg a day, a gram of pure heroin would only last 5 days when used normally. Using my method, 200mg IV a day would allow a gram to last **50 days** instead of 5. Because if you extracted it from all urine, you'd only lose 20mg a day in your shit. 20mg times 50 = 1000mg/1gram.

So instead of spending $150 every 5 days on DNM heroin, you'd be spending $150 every 50 days. Instead of spending $900 a month on heroin, you'd spend $900 a year (instead of $10,800 a year when buying every 5 days, which is ridiculous).

Do you realize how fucking powerful that is? Do you realize how sustainable that makes using an opiate? You wouldn't even have to worry about money at all!

And for other opiates it's even better. Over 95% of hydromorphone/dilaudid is pissed out. That means, using this method, a 12mg shot would last you 20 shots at least, instead of one shot. (12/100 x 5 = .6 times 20 = 12).

And if you took glucuronic acid as a supplement, I bet you'd be able to piss out 95% or more of the heroin you inject.

So with this method, you only lose 10-5mg a day per 100mg injected for morphine.

And if you extracted from your shit I bet you'd be able to use less than 1mg a day per 100mg IV, but extracting from shit is too much for me, won't do that.

All you'd have to do is collect all urine you piss out in an empty gallon jug. Then every week you go out to the woods. make a fire, and empty it all into a big steel bucket which is over the fire. Boil it down until the liquid is very reduced, let it cool, and then use enzymes/HCl to remove the glucuronic acid. Then use ph strips and solvents to extract the morphine, and boil that down until very little liquid is left, then let it completely evap using a glass pan. The morphine extracted can then easily be re-esterified into an equally potent heroin analog using glacial acetate, propionate anhydride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinic acid, etc. Easy mode, and as strong or stronger than diacetylmorphine.

And this isn't even mentioning the fun you could have using metabolites like normorphine (which could be turned into n-phenethylnormorphine). But I won't go into that in this post.

I just wanted to make this post because a couple weeks ago I created this idea, and I think it would really help people. Laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded. I want to share this free method, so that people can have a gram of heroin last them 50 days instead of 5. Basically, however long a gram lasts you, multiply that by 10, and that's how long the same gram would last you using this method (this only goes for non-fent heroin, fent dope can still be used for this method as long as there's heroin in it). If you laugh and say ""that's too complicated/weird bro why not just buy heroin?"", well I say this in return: have fun hustling, waking up sick, wasting all your money, or doing illegal and shameful things like stealing or prostituion to get your dope. This method may be weird but allows you to stop all those things, because they'd be unnecessary. 

**TL;DR** - 90% of the heroin you inject is urinated out as morphine. This can be extracted from the urine easily and turned back into an equally-potent-to-heroin morphine-ester. With this method, 90% of the heroin you inject can be reused. This means that if you inject 200mg heroin a day, you'll only lose 20mg a day. This means that instead of a gram lasting 5 days, a gram will last 50 days. Awesome, right?",1532646064.0

I didn’t want to get off I just couldn’t afford to go to my doctor this month. 

Fuck wasting my time I wanted Heroin not pills. I got 1 gram of Black Tar and it was top 3 best quality Tar I’ve ever had.

It was good last night, but the Suboxone was completely out of my system this morning and I drew a shot the night before to have as soon as I wake up.

Bliss. Pure Bliss. 

Words can’t describe and nobody knows what it’s like even remotely unless done themselves. It is TOO GOOD to be able to functionally support a Heroin habit. I don’t want to get back on this shit. Honestly. Life was better without it. 

I don’t believe that last sentence whole heartedly, but I am going to take classes for nursing in less than a month. How can I afford Heroin while going to school, without selling drugs? Impossible. 

I am the opiate addict that has a stash at all times and refuses to have it any other way. I can’t do that and function. Peace guys.

As a result, my arms are a bit fucked. I have recently found that I can register very easily with this new technique, but it seems odd and I'm hoping someone here either uses this approach or can at least tell me I'm not fucking my arm. 

The crook my left arm has always been my go-to, but I never used this particular vein due to difficulty in the past. Looking down my left arm, this is the vein on the left (of the 2 main veins in crook of arm.) 

I have long-tip syringes, and i stick it all the way in, and slowly pull out till blood starts filling the chamber. It is clearly in a vein, the blood flows into the chamber and it's the good, dark red. I push down and inject my dope. It seems a little more painful than an average shot, but nothing like a miss. No bumps or any other signs of a miss or hit artery afterwards. 

I think the lack of finesse involved in this technique is sketching me out a bit. Is there anything that could be happening other than me getting into a vein? The blood is flowing and it's the dark color that we search for. I'd like to have my arms if I decide to get clean again.

I've read some horror stories and am really worried about being sent into withdrawal. I have to work all weekend so I can't afford to just write it off and be sick again.

I’m sure some of y’all can relate to this.

I’m court ordered to this halfway house at the moment and I’ve been clean for about a month and half now. It’s not so bad, there’s some stupid little rules that get annoying, but other than that I’m just working and coming back to the house everyday. It sure beats wasting away in jail.  I’ve got about another month here if everything goes as planned. 

Here lately I’ve been thinking about moving across the country when I get out. I’m from the southeast and haven’t ever really left the state I’m in. With the way I’ve been feeling lately, I think it would help me have a new perspective on life. I don’t have a SO or any kids to worry about either. 

With that being said, being sober has allowed me to look back at my life and I’ve realized that I can’t ever be content. I work out, eat healthy, have sex when I can, have a good job, and just a lot of things to be grateful for, but I wanna just run away once my felony is dismissed and start a new life. I often romance about just being on the road and sometimes wanna add being a junkie into the mix but I know that I’m not gonna be content with that either. I have hobbies like playing guitar and going fishing but at the end of the day I’m just never satisfied. 

I think about moving away for awhile and doing a gram shot and hoping my family just never finds out that I’m gone because I’d hate to put them through the pain of losing me at such a young age over my own selfishness. 

I’m tired of lacking real connection with human beings because of social media. If you’ve ever read the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, it’s about being self sufficient and being okay with the most simple things in life. I kinda want to do that if it’s possible. 

I feel I would get better feedback here than the AA/NA meetings I go to where they would say something along the lines of “pray about it” or some other bullshit. Thanks for reading ",1532612502.0

And now I'm paying a shitty price for all the ""not nodding"" I was doing. So I finished the pinched bag, about 3/4 a gram.

I draw up a tad more water and dump it in the cooker. Mix mix mi.... 

Oh boy. Off to the Land of Nod we go. I got half my rig in mouth, the other half in my left hand mixing. Right hand? What are you doing over there? We’re not worried about it. We are the Eternal King in the Land of Nod. Also, we’re totally great at multitasking... And then. THEN!  I hear the worst sound ever. A flutter... the tiniest of flutters, the tiniest of sounds. I wake up. 

The peaceful Land of Nod has been invaded. Armies are called to the front lines. Sirens of Doom and Destruction go off. I snap to immediately, awakened abruptly from the Peaceful and Wonderful Land of Nod.

There's one bag, unopened on the table. But where... oh god. Where is the other, freshly opened gram? My eyes drift to the table where there are relics and instructions on how to enter The Land of Nod. Nothing. Destruction? Thievery? We know nothing yet. 

I survey further down, to where my non-functioning dick sits. Oh sweet baby... it looks like Tony Montana was up on hard times and tried ravishing my dick in a coke fueled rage. There is powder everywhere. Seeped into my jeans in every crevice. Tony you shit. Take off my pants first. 

Fuck. Fuck fuck. That’ll be barely salvageable. Tony wasn’t fucking around. I continue my search further, to Lady Freya’s (my fucking dog) domain. Wanton destruction and doom. Powder everyone on my shitty hardwood floors. If you want to see an atheist pray, drop his dope on the ground. I grab the first two cards I can find, both appointments for sub maintenance (hah!) and I scoop. I scoop. I FUCKING SCOOP EVERYTHING. 

All in all, my brain and body, mortal enemy and lifelong companion to the great Land we call Nod, lost about 1/4g. I would consider that a victory. But fucking Tony Montana man, he got away this time. 

This is my stupidly embellished story that happened last night. 

Oh. And the reason I couldn’t cop a nod from the 3/4g bag, was the needles I was using were too large. I typically can’t go any larger than 29 gauge, but I prefer 30/31, as my veins are tiny. But I got 28 gauge yesterday from the exchange, and I kept fucking up my shots. I finally took my old rigs and had no issue whatsoever. So the nods happened after I slammed two .2 shots consecutively and where this story begins. ",1532602066.0

I decided to make it a low priority, just as he made it a low priority to not sell me spice in lieu of dope weeks prior. Fast forward to the other day, I texted him instead of my sub connect by accident. Immediately went ""oops wrong #"" but also said ""I trust all is well..""""

&nbsp;


Well anyway, he texted me today asking me to call him back because he had ""something to confess."" Confess? Last I checked, I'm am not a priest. So, I was curious and called him back. First it was the pleasantries, like how I was and then I asked how he was doing. He told me about work he has done on his bicycle, how he saw a video that helped him tune his bicycle's mechanical disc brakes to work better than they have in a while. I briefly shared some of my bike upgrade adventures and experience working on brakes as well.

&nbsp;

Then the conversation shifted gears a little bit. ""Ever since I've been going to this methadone program, a few months ago before I started the program, I was a bottom feeder. Like I was always the one who needed something from someone. You know, I need this and need that and ever since I started the program it's been so consistent that I don't need nobody nothing. And so it's been hard to adapt to that to not need everything from everyone. You have an idea what it's like as opposed to being oblivious to it.""



I acknowledged that it can be hard, that if one doesn't keep busy it's easy to be unsure what to do with one self and express agreement.


&nbsp;



""In all reality when things like that happen it only makes us stronger....""


I continue to express agreement.


&nbsp;



Then I asked him, ""how's your tire?"" He responds to explain, ""here's the thing about the tire.."" 


Finally, we get to the confession. 


He goes on, ""I had to do a thing for Cliff and I changed my tire and the tube ended up blowing in the new tire.. so umm Cliff gave me an idea by saying you have a junk yard of tubes tires next to your doorstep.""


&nbsp;


In other words, a couple of weeks ago at 4am on ~~Cliff's pay day~~ Cliff's mom's pay day, Derrick was tasked with biking to the ATM and then to his plug for Cliff. When his tire blew out, by Cliff's recommendation he retrieved it from the junk tire stack. 


&nbsp;

Coincidentally, I was actually planning to give that tire to Derrick. 
Originally when I was still doing dope in order to get free dope, but now just because I need to get rid of it anyway. The tire size is of a type I don't intend on using again at least not for a while. At which point I wouldn't use a derelict tube that has been exposed to the elements. It's best someone gets to use it while it's still not completely wrecked on the molecular level.



&nbsp;

No harm done, wish I could find the salvage scene on the surveillance DVR just for shits and giggle. Should I appreciate liberties being taken with my trash? Yeah, just a little bit at least but like I said it was trash. 



Then lastly, after already explaining how he has been making so much progress with the methadone program he's on, explaining how he don't gotta do anything for anyone he explains he's in a minor pickle. He only has half the money needed in order to buy a bundle and wanted to know if I wanted to get on board with an order. 

&nbsp;


I've been keeping my nose clean so it was easy to say ""no, thank you."" 



&nbsp;


#P.S. --

For those of you wither literary blue balls, for those who feel like they were struck ill and given too little dope to get straight, for those and especially for those who sat through Battlestar Galactica 1980 (the weird third season of the original) - I wish to rectify this situation. Well, actually when I hastily finalized this post that last sentence is a sign that I've made great strides towards rectifying a more important issue but y'all came here for meat and potatoes with a hint of a certain kind of non-existent (as has been argued by some) ethnic spice. 


&nbsp;

TBH I thought the included details were sufficient. Perhaps if I am to post a something so disappointing it could have been done with less words. Perhaps if it were less diluted the flavor of this post would've been enjoyable. I don't have any obligation to answer for my literary crimes but I'll try something. If it don't stick, maybe the last completely unrelated point will. 


&nbsp;


**Facts:**


* No longer am I the person who leave's Cliff's bed bug infested house at 3:52 AM with ~~his~~ his mom's debit card to withdraw money to get Cliff out of withdrawal while earning two bags for myself in addition to what I buy.


* Weeks ago Cliff hit me up to see if I would do it and said ""I'll have to send Derrick since you don't spend big on partying anymore."" At the time he expected me to clamor and say ""no wait, I will do it.. and I'll get X buns too!


* A week and a half ago Cliff called me at 9 AM (I ignored) at time I'd normally be sleeping to see if I would pick up his oxy script even though days earlier I said that I was good, well and done! In his selfish wishful thinking mindset, he neglected to remember the many times in the past when I said don't call me for anything before 11am. 


* When I used to pick up Cliff's script I'd sometimes get called if the script was ready earlier as though I was a parent in bed on Christmas morning. When I'd complain he'd be like ""but you're getting something out of it.""


* Derrick is on a methadone program. He says he doesn't need the dope anymore, he's not beholden to anyone yet he still middles in order to earn some dope.


* He once said to Cliff, ""I'd like to talk about getting a raise."" Cliff was not having it, ""if he thinks I'm going to spend all that money and give him half of MY dope.."" Funny thing, that statement gave me the opportunity to say to Cliff something along the lines of ""now you know how  I feel.""


* Derrick told me he was clean and good, that the methadone program has been great for him but still hit me up to see if I'd at least go halvsies on a bun. I don't know if I can make sense of or reconcile his words and his actions. 


* I can't really judge Derrick on the last point either, I've spent a good amount of time alternating between maintenance medication and dope before I decided to exclusively stick with maintenance. 


* These bullet points aren't going to satisfy everyone, perhaps no one.
 

* Bottom line, Derrick took an inner tube off of a junked bike that was sitting in my driveway at 4am to perform a dope run.


&nbsp;


Finally....


The main reason I posted was because I was having a hard time reconciling the way Derrick is talking out of two sides of his mouth. He says things have changed for the better for him since being on the methadone program but he's literary doing the same shit he did before - just not getting sick in between.

I walked back into the living room. I put her phone on the lamp stand next to me and grabbed the lighter to light my joint. It was easy to tell it was the good stuff by the spongey bounce it had when I pinched it to smoke. I took a few hits. That was all I ever needed. Weed had a weird way of making me feel almost like I was tripping on acid or something. It wasn’t always like that, but once I started getting hard into heroin and meth and everything else, I got weird when I smoked.

The joint Victor gave me put me there. I opened the notebook that I’d found in the attic at the job. The second story started with the title, “My Boy.” It was written in a different color ink than the story about the cabinetmaker and slightly different handwriting. It went like this:

*His mother, my wife, left in a cab at six on a Wednesday morning.* *Some of her friends from college had booked rooms at a hotel in Mexico.* *They had big plans to do the same thing they’d always done since college, drink wine, smoke pot and laugh like idiots.* *There was also a conference showcasing works by artists from across Mexico.* *That was the kind of thing my wife loved to do, so two weeks before the planned date they called my wife to see if she would be able to make it.* *We talked about it.* *Things had been stressful. I gave her the credit card, and she booked a flight on the computer.*

*While she was out of town, my boy asked me if his friend, James, could come over. I agreed.* *They’d been friends since middle school and even though they went to different high schools they remained close.* *It was Saturday morning besides.*

*I liked James a lot, but he wasn’t like my son.* *His mother went through men like they were socks.* *His father was the same with women as his mother was with men, but he also had a habit of going to jail for assaulting them.* *He’d been charged with different kinds of corporate and governmental fraud over the years, and everyone in town knew it.* *James was the spitting image of his father, charismatic and funny and talented but dishonest.*

*I caught them snorting meth a month or so before that.* *They always smoked weed which I was okay with for the most part, as long as my son wasn’t smoking it before noon and took care of business.* *Meth and heroin and things like that, though, were another story.* *I’d freaked out when I found them passing a rolled-up dollar bill and leaning over an old wooden chess board to snort lines of a crystalline powder.* *I’d watched through a crack in the door before I busted in.*

*It scared me.* *When I was young, all we had were cross tops or black beauties, which were bad enough, but I knew that methamphetamine was worse.* *I screamed like crazy.* *I sent James home that night.* *It was always embarrassing to unleash my temper like that in front of my son’s friends, but it wasn’t the first time.* *I talked to him.* *I tried to make him understand that I cared too much to not be terrified at the idea of what that stuff could do to him.*

*My mother-in-law needed to go to dialysis on Saturday afternoon.* *My wife usually took her mother to her dialysis appointments, but since she was gone, I’d promised to take her.* *And that morning, James was already over at the house.* *Things seemed to be well.* *The boys insisted on me giving them work for some money, so they could go to the movies and see some friends later that afternoon.* *I had reservations.* *Finally, I told them I’d give them 50 bucks to clean up about three years of magnolia leaves on the side of the house.* *They ran downstairs, grabbed a box of trash bags and went to work.*

*I watched from the porch for a minute.* *My son picked up a pile of leaves.* *James had a bag opened and held out towards the pile, but when my boy tried to throw the pile into the bag, maybe 50 cockroaches popped out of the soggy mess of leaves.* *There were cockroaches on their faces and down their collars and shirts and pants, a swarm of them.* *The boys spit dramatically and ran away from each other, and it took a minute for them to regroup.* *We all laughed about it, but they got it done.* *They cleaned up a major mess of leaves, which was really a much bigger job than one I could pay anyone else to do for 50 bucks.* *When they’d finished, I was just getting out of the shower and dressed to pick up my mother-in-law.*

*I paid them 50 each for their good work.* *They were filthy and said they’d shower before leaving for the evening.* *When I got back from dialysis, my son was in his room sleeping.* *He must have not stayed out long, or so I supposed.* *James was gone.* *It was suspicious, so I opened the door and listened several times to check in.* *He was snoring soundly at midnight when I finally fell asleep.*

*The next day, I started doing the math.* *If I had come home at 8:30, then he’d have been asleep for at least 12 hours by 8:30 that morning.* *It was 11:30 when I started worrying.* *That was 15 hours of sleep.* *It seemed like too long, and as soon as I opened the door, I knew.*

*Maybe it was the lack of any audible breath.* *Maybe it was a chill in the room.* *Maybe it was the innate sense within my own soul that knew his had departed.*

*The day he was born he weight 8 pounds 3 ounces.* *He cried immediately, and since his mother was out of it from the drugs they’d given her, they handed him to me first.* *He stopped crying.* *His little body wriggled in my arms, and again, there was that innate sense of recognition between us.* *I could tell he knew that I was his father, and that moment changed my life.* *That day marked the rest of my life in away not even my own marriage had, but as I stepped closer to the bed on that Sunday morning, there was no movement. I thought about the moment he’d asked if James could come over. I thought about pulling those two 50 dollar bills out of my wallet the day before and handing them over to the boys.* *I thought about his mother.*

*He was my boy.*

*And we buried him.*

The second story in that notebook didn’t feel good. It reminded me of my own father, who was a bastard, but still strong sentiment had been invoked. The weed didn’t help. Life with Gabriella was in general a desperate and miserable affair besides. She was still nodded out and standing up in the kitchen.

I grabbed her phone. There was a number half dialed already in it, probably something Gabriella nodded out in the middle of and forgot about. The number started with a 1-800. I went to her browser and found pictures of myself running across the freeway with that bag.  They were the pictures taken from the back of the Chinese restaurant by that little black guy.

It became difficult to breathe. My heart flipped. My paranoia skyrocketed. There were phases of all the emotion. First, I couldn’t even think. There was just anxiety pouring through my veins like acid and strangling me. Then, I sat up. I decided that if the cops were coming, then there wasn’t anything to do about it. They’d come and get me. I’d serve my time. It couldn’t be any worse than life with Gabriella, but then, I wondered if she’d even got a phone call off. If she was nodded out and left the meatballs burning on the stove and the number was only halfway dialed.

I looked back at her phone and smoked a cigarette. It showed me walking out of Home Depot from the security cameras. And a different security camera outside of the store showed me coming up off my feet to clock that loss prevention guy. The rest of the photos were of me fleeing across the freeway and the cars wrecking.

The article was short. It talked about the Home Depot employee being listed in critical condition with trauma to the head and those who had been in the car wrecks had suffered minor injuries. There was a large reward for information that lead to my capture. I pulled on my cigarette. The nicotine laden smoke rolled over the back of my tongue and sank into my lungs. This was no big deal. If I kept her plenty high and supplied until we could get out of town in the Focus, it would be okay. I would ditch her somewhere after all of that.

Gabriella remained stuck in that position in the kitchen but for the slight bounce of her body waking up for a millisecond and nodding right back out. I walked past her. In the bedroom, sleep came easy. A terrible vision woke me up in the middle of the night.

Across from the bed right in my line of sight was myself but not just myself. You know the way dreams make characters out of weird blends of the different people in your life, like someone in your dream might be your third-grade teacher and your mom simultaneously, and its hard to tell where or when they or if they even are divided from each other in your dreams? The vision I saw was half of myself and half Rufus, but the evil orange glow of the eyes and voice belonged to something else entirely. Something from somewhere else. My head had been severed, and the figure held it by the hair so that it could address me. He spoke.

“Clyde? You’re going to let her do that to you?”

“I guess.” My lip quivered. The image was terrifying.

“She was going to turn you in! Where’s the Clyde I know? Where’s Boom Boom? Has he gone soft?”

“N-n-n-n-n-o-o. Boom Boom?” I had forgotten all about the nickname. My life on the streets with Rufus existed lightyears from where I was then in that bed at Gabriellas. Now I was soft. The evil entity speaking to me from the dark was right.

“You let her fart in your mouth?” It was true. I remembered. I hadn’t told you yet, because I was embarrassed about it. But I’ll spare the details of what exactly we were engaged in that allowed her to squeeze one of those wandering ghosts out of her wheezy colon and directly into my mouth. You can probably guess. Whatever that was talking to me though, he already knew.  “She farted in your mouth Clyde.”

“What am I supposed to do?”

“I don’t know. Here’s an idea.” With its other hand, the figure pulled a 2x4 with seven or eight nails sticking out one end of it. It was a crudely fashioned murder weapon. “I’ll leave it here for you.”

Winter sunlight coming into the room the next morning gave me some peace. The vision of the man holding my head and talking to me from the netherworld about murdering Gabriella was just a dream. I could go about my day. My imagination had gotten the best of me, but when I pulled my jeans off the chair across from the bed, the chair the evil being had been sitting in, a 2x4 fell from behind it. There were nails through the end of it. I slipped my pants on in the kitchen.

Gabriella was stuck in the same position. That was a long nod. I figured she must have had some benzos or something, but before I woke her up and talked her into leaving town in a hurry, I pinched the fold of bills in my pocket. It should have been 200 for the drills plus another 130 after working with Vic the day before. It was enough to get us high and out of town.

“GABRIELLA!”

She startled. She stood up and screamed at me for a minute but didn’t make any sense. I held the cash in front of her and said,

“Let’s get high. I wanna get out of town.”

“Why?”

“Baby. It’s just time. I got some hook ups down in Florida. We can get some good stuff and live the good life on white sand beaches.” It was a lie. I knew no one in Florida, but the sands were white, at least in some places.

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah, babes. Let’s just get 100 bucks worth today. I’ll put some gas in the Focus. We’ll bust out of town, baby. It’ll be great. Just you and me. What do you think?”

“Hmmm… I guess. I haven’t been on a road trip in a while. It would be nice.” She was still wiping her eyes. Gabriella was usually sweetest before she did any heroin in a day, so long as she knew some was coming quickly. “I’ll call Dominic. He’s up early and has good stuff. Do you have my phone?”

“Okay. Yeah. Here it is. Before we go though, I gotta see my sister. I’ll call her on the way to Dominic’s. Maybe we can meet her at Wendy’s or something.”",1532578033.0

It's been 36 hours and I'm still not sick yet. I've been sniffing street dope for four plus years and this is my first experience with morphine. With the street dope, I get sick around 24 hours, so I'm thinking it has something to do with purity. I could totally pull something out of my ass as to why it's taking so long for me to get sick and probably be at least on the right track, but I'll turn it over to you all for an answer that would be anything more than a guess. Just really curious why this is so different. It's surreal to me that I'm not in agonizing pain or sweating yet.

The only reason I've thought about dope is because it feels weird *not* being high for three days, not due to cravings related to sickness. The thought came and went and I feel fine again. Last time I tried kicking, I didn't get very sick at all. I had some methadone for the first time then took suboxone when I started feeling a tiny bit uncomfortable later on. Ended up just not even taking any more suboxone after that because nothing happened. A leg kick here, a stretch there and that was it.

Your mom was sitting on my bed, watching as I busted down a pill and begging me to give her a line. Your dad was in my living room and had cut her off since you would be arriving in a few weeks. We all suspected your mom was still snorting oxy, but she always denied it. She had tears in her eyes, pleading with me for just one bump, saying that your dad cut her off cold turkey. She promised me she hadn't touched anything else, as I heard that she used to pop Xanax all day long before I met your parents a couple months prior. That moment was the first time I failed you. Knowing that cold turkey withdrawal was not good for a fetus, I caved in. Your mom agreed to keep it our little secret. She stood up from my bed, eager to grab the straw from my hands, her eyes focused on the size of powder I was pushing to the side for her, when I saw you move. Her entire stomach shifted from left to right. I placed my hand on you, amazed at how strong your movements were and how quickly you danced around in her abdomen. 

I remember the first time I met you. At two weeks old, you were absolutely beautiful. My puppy laid at the bottom of the swing you slept in, guarding you like you were the most important thing on this earth. And to your parents, you should have been. I brought you over a small gift, as I assumed people do when meeting a new baby girl. Your mom tossed it aside after peeking in the bag. I got to hold you tight on my chest as you slept, in awe of just how beautiful you were. Your dad had gone on a run with my boyfriend, making a couple bucks off of our habit, but I was more excited to meet you and asked to stay home with your mom instead of tagging along like I usually would. You had that new baby smell, I breathed it in until it was overpowered by the smell of cold air and cigarettes. It was middle of winter, but your mom needed a smoke break after hiding the plate she used to snort her lines off of under her bed. Instead of speaking up as she opened up the bedroom window to blow her smoke out as you sat six feet away from her, I kept my mouth shut. Fear of pissing her off, I failed you again. 

Over the next couple months, we met a handful of times. Never for too long as we saw your parents mostly for one reason only. You were growing so quickly, a chunky little thing who had learned to smile pretty early. At three months old I saw you one night. We met your parents at a local gas station for my brother in law to meet up with your daddy. Your dad was slurring his words, barely able to keep his eyes open. We asked what he took, he mumbled something incoherently about how many bars he had left. My BIL walked over to the car. Your mom was slumped with her head between her legs, cigarette in her hand. He tapped on the window and she shot up, hiding the cigarette quickly because you were in the backseat. Bundled up to fight the cold air at 11 at night, we did our best to not fail you that night. We called your aunt to pick you up and take you home. We waited in the cold until she came for you, angry that we were getting involved. I got home that night and cried for you. I cried to my boyfriend the next day, worried about you. We went back and forth weighing the pros and cons of getting child services involved. Your parents lived with your grandparents, so we knew you would always be well taken care of as long as you were under their roof, but that wasn't enough. They couldn't watch you 100% of the time. They didn't stop your parents from taking you out all night while they drove around dropping off orders. 

But I never called. I have no excuse for failing you. I single handedly could've changed your fate sweet girl. I wonder today what could have been different if I had. Would there have been an intervention? Would you be in a better, loving home? Would your parents have gotten clean? 

The story given to family and friends was SIDS, but I was told what really happened the night you left this earth. I hope you know you were loved by your family. I hope you know you were loved by distant friends such as us. I hope your last moments of life were nothing but comforting. I know you were asleep in your parents bed, I know they both were high on Xanax and god knows what else that night. I know that they blame themselves for your death, as I blame myself for not doing my best to make sure you were safe. I still think about you all the time, I look into my own baby's eyes and think of yours. How you deserved better, you deserved longer. You deserved to be protected. You deserved to be safe. You didn't deserve to leave this earth after only spending four months on it. You didn't deserve parents who prioritized a nod over their newborn. 

I'm so sorry I failed you sweet girl. ",1532543412.0

A friend of mine said my body was shaking or whatever and I was drooling. He held me down as i was lying on the stairs. He was freaked out so i didn't ask any questions. 

Idk if that was a seizure. I have no memory of any of it and felt fine, maybe a little tired. I didn't even realise i had any missing memory. My friend said that i spoke to him after and said no to him calling an ambulance and that i had my head between my knees. I don't remember talking about it or him on the phone with emergency services. I refused to go to hospital and cancelled the ambulance. 

What exactly happened to me? Idk what seizures really are or even if that was what i had. My friend kept going on about something like ""grand mall"" but because he was so freaked i didn't ask him. I have looked online at seizures but i don't have epilepsy. I didn't piss myself either.

So, I have read that the -azole class of antifungal drugs is an extremely potent CYP450 inhibitor, thus one would would think it therefore is an opiate potentiator. Even my pharmacist warned me of mixing this with my Rx oxy and highly recommended that I reduce my dosage as it increases blood concentration levels. This excited me in that my Rx allotment is extremely minimal and I already had been seeking out the best ways to stretch it as I do indeed have an unfortunate tolerance. 

Tried this combo today, and much to my dismay, I actually felt a DECREASE in effects of my daily dosage. I feel like I took nothing at all, hours later. Needless to say, I’m not happy about this. I read somewhere online that though CYP450 inhibitors may increase blood levels and leave the drug in your system longer - that they, on the other side, reduce the amounts of feel-good metabolites? Does anyone know anything about this? As a newbie to potentiators (I’ve only tried DXM thus far, which also didn’t do shit), what should I try next?? I’ve read about Tagamet but it seems that operates on CYP450 as well? Is my body just weird?

With that being said, im going to assume the prices are that much cheaper and hopefully the quality is very high since it more than likely hasn't traveled as much! 

But my main questions are what should I expect for prices? 

How can I tell if what i'm looking at is quality, i'm gonna guess with tar its a little easier to tell if fents/cuts in it versus ECP (may be incorrect just assuming since tar vs powder) colors, scents, how it smokes/chases on foil or anything prior to cold copping when I actually get the product in my hands to look at.

Any other info for someone whose never seen tar before, every bit of info is greatly appreciated! If anything is not allowed in this post inform me and I will edit it out! :)

Also it was to be right after we got off work.  We didn't want to but then he offers us a 16th. Of course we hastily agreed but wanted to know how/why he was offering so much. Well, he says he's going to reup off the plug and there may be a chase and there was a very small chance of gun play. The plug is high enough up that he's got 10+ guys who work under him and he always carried s gun and was known to follow through on violent thrrstd.  

Well I had reservations about this. I have a lot of empathy for way more people than I should but ripping this guy off felt more to me like stealing a candy bar from Wal-Mart than ripping off a real person. I did however worry about how this would all go down and also riding in the hood at 2am. The plan was to trade this guy a fucking bb gun for the ball. No shit, a fucking bb gun. It looked real if you didn't examine it closely or look in the barrel. Also it had almost enough weight. That being said it'd take a fucking moron to go for this. Just the dumbest idiot ever. I said so. I thought we were going way out of our way to, best case scenario, look like the most pathetic of fools.

We got to the spot in the city and these fools keep being so obviously shady. They tried to park on the side of the street instead of the parking lot. Luckily I was able to talk then out of this and more dumb shit. After the typical dboy ""wait a min"" ""almost there"" ""actually meet me at this other place"" he finally got to us. Lo and behold he sent one of his guys! The guy looked new to the world of crime and paranoid and his dumbass got out of his car and walked up to ours. He looked really paranoid and kept looking around. He/his boss had been told he had to get the gun in a bag bc someone in the car couldn't know about the gun. Well, the guy accepted it and the exchange went np. My dumbass cuz still peeled out anyway. I'm certain this guy wasn't going to check the gun out any time soon. He was just an errand boy. We made it away and cuzs friend got many pussies texts and calls but he gave us half of the very short ball and it's good quality ecp.

I hate being involved in ripping anyone off though. Thankfully it was a higher up guy or a civilian. I hope the poor errand boy didn't get reprimanded too harshly. We're otw home now. How's everyone else night?

My fiancé woke up kinda sick and called our dude who lives 5 min from us, we'll call him D, to hold him over until our regular guy, we'll call him J, turns on his phone. Problem is he didn't wake me up nor did he get me anything from D. So I wake up (also kinda sick at this point) and realize he's not there so I call him. When he answers it is blatantly obvious that he just did a shot. So I ask him if he got me anything and he said no he was just waiting in the car for J to be around. Obviously I'm kinda pissed off at this point cuz like....dude you couldn't have woken me up. Anywho, we hang up and he calls me back saying that J is around and he's just gonna go to him which is about 45 min round trip if J is quick about it which is a total gamble. Sometimes he's waiting for us, sometimes we wait 20 min for him. So I ask him to pick me up so at best I only have to wait 20-30 min for my shot instead of 45-1hr. So I'm anxious and feeling more sick by the minute and I had to sit next to my fiancé all noddy in the car. It sucked. I was super pissed and I let him know it. Whatever. We wait about 10 min for J, I do my shot and I feel fine. 

Fast forward a few hours. He is significantly higher than me. Like...I'm talking wayyy higher than me. I'm still kind of salty about him getting more than me, especially because he has made such a huge stink about me having minuscule amounts more than him in the past. He's a major hypocrite sometimes but anyway. So I ask him if I could have one more bag than him. ONE. When I know god damn well he did at least 3 or 4 for his first shot from D because they aren't as strong. I ask for one and he says he doesn't want to because these are stronger than the other ones and he doesn't want to give them up, but he's more than happy to call D back and get the less strong ones from him. I'm like.....but ok I say. He asks if I can wait a little bit and I said sure whatever. 

Another couple hours go by and I ask if I could call D. He asks if I really wanna do that and I said that he could just give me one more of his right now and we wouldn't have to go through all that. He gets pissed, I get pissed, we fight, and he finally says he'll give me half of a bag. Again I'm like......but ok I'm done fighting with him. He splits a bag with me that I added to another one leaving me with two left and he had one. When I went to go do my two, he freakin asked me to split one with him because now it was uneven again!!!! Like wtf!!!! He proceeded to make me feel like a POS so I just gave in and gave it to him. I didn't feel like fighting anymore. 

He works third shift and so he went to work and I was emptying our garbage can. When I moved the can, there was a bag on the floor. I thought it was empty but when i moved I saw tape and my heart started to flutter. I picked it up and it was full! And it was a big bag too. Take that, you were a greedy dick today. Thank you JJ, you have no idea how much I needed you today. Only the third time it's ever happened to me and it's still just as exciting as the first. If you've made it this far, I apologize for it being so long but thanks for reading. I hope JJ leaves a little gift for all of you in one way or another. Be safe everyone. 


TL;DR: Fiancé was a greedy douche with our bags today.  When he went to work, I found a huge unopened bag when I moved our garbage can. Thank you JJ :)",1532500118.0

Just wanted to vent about my poor, dear friend. He just OD'd a few weeks ago and didn't make it. He was the smartest guy I ever knew, a genuine genius - without a doubt could've gotten a PHd in Maths / Physics (but prob Maths) from any university in the world - just didn't care to take that path (think *Good Will Hunting*). He came top of his school (academically the best school in our city of 2 million) while being drunk as fuck for his final exams. He went to university for a semester or 2 but decided to drop out to be a game designer for about $100k as an 18 year old about 20 years ago ... so shittons of cash.

His younger brother (of 3 in total), who had a few demons in the head, OD'd and died about 10 years ago. He was a sweet kid, but we teased him and were unkind to him when he was younger. I'm so sorry.

His youngest brother was a little scamp who made everyone smile. Perhaps led astray by his brothers, perhaps on his own, he became quite keen on the drugs and died of an OD about 3 years ago. He had a young son.

I'm just sad is all and wanted to tell the cliff notes of this sad tale. I feel so sad for their parents, what more do they have to live for? Poor people, they had everything, plenty of $$$ (I mean plenty), 3 brilliant sons, respect in the community; and now it all has gone.

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job. ",1532490506.0

I decided on the first day off the coke, I'd do a little dope cotton shot at like 7-8pm and do a proper shot tomorrow.

Only, my cotton shot was insanely potent. 

So potent, I fucking OD'd.

Only, it took my a few minutes. I untied and rushed downstairs to do chores. I washed a plate and my girlfriend's mom said something to me (she was over) and I realized something was terribly, terribly wrong.

I couldn't see.

I could hear her words but it was just babbled nonsense. The *whomp whomp whomp* you get in your ears with a rush was overpowering. 

I thought it had been 10 minutes. It was less than 15 seconds. 

I knew I couldn't just die in the kitchen. I had to get upstairs.

""I'll be back,"" I stuttered, not even looking at her mom. I clawed my way up the stairs as fast as I could. I threw myself in my bed. I nodded off.

My gf knew something was up when I didn't come back down, so she woke me up. I could hardly think or swallow or breathe. She pulled my head up out of the sheets and said: ""you seem like you need a back rub.""

that was the best fucking back rub of my goddamn life. I had her stabbing me with her elbows so hard it left mtherfucking bruises. She rubbed my back lotion and all for 2, 3 hours. I remember 30 seconds of it.

The resulting back pain and migraine were amazing at work the next day.",1532479282.0

This guy is a proper yardy, I'm in south London so you can imagine the type. Now, I'm quite openly gay, I'm not particularly camp and I don't actually look gay to most people but, I will talk about it.

So this dealer knew and it comes to one day where I buy some gear of him and I'm smoking a bit of the white in the park. He's stood next to me, we're just chatting because supposedly he's waiting for someone. Next thing I know, he grabs my hand and puts it on his dick. I'm like 'What the fuck, Marcus man!' and he's like 'Go on James, touch it, go on.'

Basically, I'll spare you the details but, we went back to his house around the corner. He gave me a bunch more Cocaine, that I smoked a load of whilst we was doing the dirty, and then he gave me some more Heroin. Now, I'm a bit confused about how I feel about this.

He is actually attractive to me and I would have done it if he was just some guy on grindr or whatever. But, it just feels a bit strange to have done that with him. And I feel like it might happen again..... Which, I don't know how I feel about that either. Because, it's a very easy way to obtain drugs and I did enjoy it but, I don't know if I want that to be a thing I do.

I use subs to help chip, but do not have a script for methadone or suboxone. Nor am I implying the hate is on this sub, or not on this sub, but the internet at large. For those of you who think that using Done or Subs isn't being clean, hear me out.

If the sole definition of being clean was to not be taking any sort of narcotics regardless of circumstace then yes, maintenance is not being clean. 

But to me, when we use the word clean around here, it's so much more than that. Its about living a clean life, having a clean house (and because you want a clean house. Not just because you're high where you could be cleaning up pigeon shit and feeling great), having clean relationships, clean clothes, a clean nose, clean skin, a clean outlook, clean relationships, a clean diet, clean eyes, fuck, a clean car! 

It even gets me down when people say ""yeah, I know I'm not clean, but at least I'm not using heroin anymore."" Fuck that! No one on here picked up an addiction simply so they could fuck up their lives and post pill porn on this sub. They did it as a form of self medication, whether it was for physical pain, emotional pain, general life pain. Its just like any other medication, be it anti-depressants, bipolar medication, schizophrenia meds, blood pressure meds, and any other sort of meds. 

You have to go through a few until you find the right one. If one of those meds happens to be diamorphine laced with fentanyl, than so be it. But to those who end up on the right one, be it methadone or suboxone, and that itch that you first tried to scratch with opiates is still satisfied, but you're living a sober life, good for you. Truly good for you. I just dont see how its any different that if youre just as clear headed as someone taking SSRIs, or any other meds you that you need to function day to do day, why you should feel even the tiniest bit guilty about that. If you come out the other side as back to being the person you loved before your addiction, with the added empathy and life experience that someone who goes through addiction can acquire, than you might even be in a better place then where you started. If 1 year, or 5 years, or 20 years of addiction means you come out the other side a better friend, a better partner, a better father, or sister, mother or brother because you now have a true appreciation for life, don't let anyone take that from you. At least you can spend the rest of your life being the best person you could ever possibly be if you just look forward. 

So to all of those out there who hate on people on maintenance, fuck you, but more importantly, to those who feel like they still haven't succeeded because they're still on some form of maintenance, stop right now. You were able to feel that euphoria and put it behind you. You da real MVPs

Drug tests twice a week. The first few days I got out all I had was subs which helped psychically but not mentally, they also show on the 10 panels I take. So I went through those quick and started taking Kratom every day. It's helps a lot, better than subs IMO but I still have the urge to use the needle and dope. The needle fixation resulted in me shooting etizolam in PG solution which believe it or not is the closest I've felt to shooting dope albeit for like 30 second and not a rush you can even compare. Just the instant depressant relaxation. I've continued to do that for a while and still am. It helps with the craving of the needle itself. Anyways to the point.. It's been a little over a month since the end of my 3-4 point per day IV habit and I have access to quite a few 50mg tramadol which I could trade for just a couple bars.

So the veins in my arms need a break, and at this point so do my hands. I got these really tiny rigs (50 units and a 6mm needle) from the exchange near us so they're great for small veins. Question is: when I hit in certain veins near the top of my middle knuckle (so on the finger itself, not where it joins the hand) I get a register and hit slowly and it barely hurts, but it irritates my finger to the point where it's difficult to use for a few days. I still feel at least some of the hit though. But if I hit in the vein to the side of that knuckle, there aren't hardly any consequences. The obvious answer here is: just use the veins to the sides of the knuckle, but finding a register there is difficult whereas hitting the top of the knuckle is virtually an instant and guaranteed register.

I wanted to, but it was hard to find a place to put it and as it was, there were too many elements that were too difficult to tie together for me to make it work. So now I have a chance. Most of it you have never heard, but there are some things with which you should be familiar. For instance, you might recognize where it starts.

It starts in that second-floor studio in that white washed adobe building across from the jail. The one my mom paid rent for over the phone, you remember right? It smelled like hot metal. It’s where I dated that red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over to see me hours before she ever showed up. It’s where I met Danielle. I’m sure you remember her, but now that I think about it, I don’t know if I ever told you that it smelled like hot metal. Anyway, now you know. It smelled like hot metal, and it was miserable.

So, this dope dealing couple had lived there. Bo and Angel. That’s how I knew the place existed, and I had even tried to sleep on a pile of clothes on the linoleum floor with cotton fever there once. But they got kicked out, for several reasons, but one in particular was the morning that I sat on the stairs outside going up to the apartment.

The landlord owned and ran a local fast food place called The Chow Cart in the same parking lot. He saw me sitting there. His customers and employees saw me too. He didn’t like that. My friends told me later that he specifically mentioned that morning that raggedy bum sat on the stairs outside of the apartment when he was kicking them out. It looked to sketchy. He said it looked like they were selling drugs or something which they were.

But when I came along, six or seven months later, the old man had forgotten that he’d ever seen me sitting outside of the apartment or that he disliked my appearance there so much that he kicked his tenants out. He didn’t know that it was me. It must have been the crusty black scabs on my face that made me hard to recognize. They were a significant change in my appearance, or maybe it was the fact that the place had been for rent since he kicked Angel and Bo out and needed money. Either way, he let me live there. His son sat me down at one of the tables in the restaurant and went over a list of rules that we both signed. Then, he gave me the key and took me up to the room. It was miserable, like I said, but there was a TV left behind and free cable and a dusty love seat that came free with the place. Sleeping on that love seat did irreversible damage to my spine and neck, and when I woke up at 4 every morning dope sick and in pain from trying to sleep on the love seat, the Jersey Shore would be playing in marathons in the freezing predawn dark. A combination of the sickness and depression and the absurdity of the Jersey Shore burned the audio forever into my mind and emotions. The damage has been irreversible.

It only took the old man two weeks to realize that I was the same story as Bo and Angel, except maybe I was a little more desperate than they had been. I stole the coffee can of gravel my downstairs neighbor kept outside of his door and used for an ash tray.  He was the landlord’s nephew and manager at the restaurant. That never looks good. Even Bo and Angel hadn’t done that.

Anyway, the old man told me I had to go in the parking lot between my building and the restaurant one morning before it opened. He found one of his customer’s wallets in the snow while we were talking about it. He was an honest man. I tried to talk him into giving the wallet to me as if I were somehow better suited to take care of it and make sure his customer got it. I don’t know what I was thinking, but he seemed horrified. Danielle and Mike came over to help me move out a few days later and stash the TV in the snow behind a store. I left the place spotless, literally. I crawled backwards out of the place with two rags wiping up my foot prints as I left.

Now, when Bo and Angel moved out of that same apartment the spring before, they ended up living with this couple in a double wide on the south side of town. We’ll call this couple, Gary and Cherry, to protect them or whatever. I remember when Angel told me about how nice Cherry had been to her on the phone before they moved in. I imagine the conversation went something like this,

“*Oh, Cherry, you know life’s so crappy.* *We’ve just endured (insert long list of unfortunate circumstances associated with severe heroin addiction and dealing, like: losing your place, getting diseases, losing another place, getting robbed, being sick, getting shorted by your supplier, the dope’s no good anyway, getting evicted again, etc.).”* This is my imagination of what Angel said to Cherry. That’s why it’s in italics. It seems plausible, but according to Angel, Cherry at some point actually said,

“Why don’t you two just come home.”

Angel recounted this to me with emotion conveying some sort of sincere love or familial bond between the two couples, especially her and Cherry, but I always recognized this kind of thing as totally bogus when I was addicted. No one loved anyone in the game. It seemed like things with Gary and Cherry might sour quickly for Bo and Angel in my opinion. And they did.

Within a week, I think, Gary had put so much pressure on Bo to give up so much dope for free, even though they were paying rent, that Bo and Angel left. Both couples could be heard around town talking terribly about each other. It was just like I expected, and however keen I had been to predict how things would go for Bo and Angel with Gary and Cherry, I was completely blind about how it would go for myself.

Gary was from Louisiana like me, but from the north. He had long blonde hair and snake eyes. I always thought he seemed like someone you see on those real-life murder mystery shows where some guy does something so heinous that no one can believe it, killing his family or whatever for insurance money.

He met Cherry some years before, I don’t know where, and he identified the tattoo on her hand as the symbol for Nibiru. They both loved Zechariah Sitchin. They knew all his books. They believed we were created by an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who bred their DNA with that of apes to get us. Our purpose was to mine gold for their atmosphere, which helped keep the heat in while it made its 36000 yearlong orbit around another star and our own sun.

Cherry had a big saggy belly and buck teeth and thick, thick glasses. She had two boys from other men.  They had Gary for a stepdad and Cherry for a mom, both shooting heroin, meth and cocaine in the back room and screaming at them for trying to talk to them. That was their life.

After getting kicked out of the very same apartment as Bo and Angel, I moved directly into the very same double wide that they moved into after they got kicked out. I lived in the small room between the living room and bathroom at Gary and Cherry’s place. It was okay at first. They helped me get around to rip people off and the different things I used to do to come up. I had some money. They had some money. Our favorite dealers got caught with a bunch of guns and dope and an underage cousin at their house, which really sucked, so we made a deal amongst ourselves to quit. We would get well one last time and on the first, which was fast approaching, Cherry would see her doctor with Gary. Between the two of them, they would get Cherry’s Clonazepam prescription upped from 60 one milligram pills a month to 90. When they went, they got it upped to 90 two milligram pills a month. We were in heaven. I got 30 out of the deal. Kicking was going to be easy.

Another thing I forgot to say was that the little Chevy Blazer they drove around in had no brakes. It had, until the day we planned to kick and got the huge order of Clonazepam, worked for us. There had only been one incident where we tapped a guy’s bumper at the gas station. He didn’t care. That morning though, we got back to the trailer, took our pills and once they set in, we decided we’d get high just one more time. I mean, what’s the point of having so many powerful benzos on hand if you can’t slap a thick tar shot on top of it to get you good and high? You know what I’m talking about. So we headed in the brakeless, green Trail Blazer to Walmart to meet Bo in his golden 4Runner with the back window busted out of it.

While we waited, I ran into the store and stole two of the big boxes of Mike and Ikes, the regular green box and another one of the tropical variations, I can’t remember. When Bo showed up, we got high. I put a loaded rig with the rest of my dope in the green Mike and Ike box, folded it at the top and placed it in the door. We took off towards the back roads. Between the large dose of Clonazepam, however much Gary took, the shots of black we’d just done and not having brakes, Gary almost swerved off the road and then almost hit a cop. The cop turned around. We said there was no dope in the car. They searched it anyways and we ended up in jail.

We were being charged with felony possession. The guards beat me up and shoved my head in the crap hole in the padded cell for talking too much crap. I had nightmares, sweats, sneezes, all of that good stuff. After two weeks, the morning we were supposed to go to court, they come hand Gary and me a piece of paper each saying the charges were dropped. Gary called Cherry. Cherry had written a letter to our judge who had known her since she was a little girl and rode motorcycles with Cherry’s dad. It’s a small town there. They let me go, but it was a known fact that he’d planned and helped execute the escape of three other prisoners only months before. The DA couldn’t prove it. They’d come up with some other bogus charges and held him for three months. I walked.

That’s when I called Danielle, and she’d been held against her will by Mike and all that. But before we ever went to Justin’s or any of that other stuff, she and I went to Cherry’s. Cherry had taken my 25 pills and put them in her nightstand. She said I could have a few. I took 25. She got mad, and that night Danielle and I had loud and obnoxious meth sex until daylight. Cherry didn’t like that either. I found out she had been manipulating my parents, telling them that I’d caused her husband to go to jail and left her and her kids with nothing for money or food or electricity or any kind of transportation in the middle of winter. It wasn’t how it had happened. While I didn’t mind manipulating my parents for money or doing them wrong myself, I really despised the idea of her doing it.

While I still had those pills and was doing meth with Danielle, I would go into bouts of dementia where I’d talk nonsense and not know where I was. Cherry wanted to get back at me, so she called my dad and put the phone in my hands in the middle of one of those episodes. I was saying something about Snoop Dogg, when I heard my father’s voice,

“Riley! Riley! What’s going on? What are you talking about?”

I snapped out of it enough to realize what was happening. Fat Cherry stood smirking at me in the hallway like she was waiting for a train wreck to happen and couldn’t look away. “Nothing, Poppa. I’m good.”

“You don’t sound good, Riley.”

Anyway, you get the point. It was ridiculous. After that Danielle and I would park outside of her bedroom window late at night and talk loudly about all the heroin we had and the Clonazepam we had and have loud and obnoxious sex until daylight. Danielle hated Cherry too.

By the time Gary got out of jail, Cherry, who was a 42-year-old woman, was in a relationship with my 17-year-old friend we called Tweaker Bird. They were completely in love.  Gary says he never knew about that or didn’t care, but when he and Cherry went out into the desert one night. They started a fire in a trashcan inside of an abandoned trailer. It was a bad idea. Cherry burned to death inside of that trailer. No one knows if it was Gary or not, but he’s never been to jail for it. We just know he was there. That was years ago.

Anyway. That’s the story I wanted to tell you. Maybe next time I’ll tell you the one where this old lady shot her great Danes in the head for no reason and paid my friends 60 bucks to cremate them.",1532400728.0

A bit of history: I’m a retired (female) firefighter/paramedic. I got hurt on the job and got a medical retirement about 8 years ago. I have been in Pain Management ever since. I have procedures pretty regularly like injections and stuff like that to help control the pain. A couple months ago a procedure went wrong and I ended up with a pretty serious spinal cord injury. I’m working hard to learn how to walk again. 

I have always done well with people. I’m pretty outgoing and funny (if I do say so myself) and I’m decent looking. I got a lot of attention as a female firefighter, my body was amazing because if how physically demanding our job was (when we weren’t sitting on our asses at the station playing video games when it was slow, lol). When I had to retire I went thru a serious mourning period. I felt like I had experienced a death. 

Over the last 8 years I’ve gotten passed that depression and started feeling good about myself again. I focused on taking care of my kids and husband, and dove into taking in rescue dogs from the shelter that need more medical care than they can give (like around the clock care) and are basically unadoptable because of their conditions. I found a new love. I was doing great. Taking my meds as prescribed, never failed a drug test, had a great relationship with my PM doc, I had nothing to hide and he trusted me 100%. Sadly he moved away recently so another doctor did my procedure that left me with a spinal cord injury.

This has completely turned my world upside down. I can’t drive, I can’t walk without a cane or walker more than 20 feet, my husband bought me a mobility scooter and I have to use that for grocery shopping and Costco and stuff like that. People stare. I want to flip them off. But I just ignore them. Up until last week I feel like I did pretty good at staying positive about the whole thing. But last week I learned that I’ll probably never be able to pee normally again (I have serious retention problems from the SCI, and I can’t feel when my bladder is full, which causes me to leak at times, and I can’t feel that I’m wet). It’s a fucking nightmare. Last week the urologist said I’m going to have to cath myself several times a day for the rest of my life. I lost it. I have been an emotional wreck since the appointment. This has taken everything from me. I’m trapped in my house when my husband is at work because I can’t drive. I can’t have sex. I can’t even pee normally and I piss myself pretty regularly. It’s humiliating. I can’t walk my dogs. I have to use that scooter and I hate people staring at me. Friends have abandoned me. Thank god for my husband and my kids and my dogs. They are the only things getting me thru right now.

I crashed and burned emotionally. I’m self medicating my depression with my pain meds. It’s getting out of control but I don’t even really care. I started banging my dilaudid and today I moved up from 8mg to 12mg. I’m in a downward spiral and I see it coming but I don’t even care to stop it. I hate myself. I hate this mess. I hate my body because it’s failing me and it’s not even my fault. I’m pretty young and so I have many many years ahead of this. I’ve plateaued in my recovery, so anything else I gain will be slow and minimal. So this is it. It took an hour for my life as I knew it to be totally destroyed. It has effected all of us in my family. It’s a complete lifestyle change from my family. I don’t know what to do from here. 

I’m drowning. ",1532382826.0

I popped 30mg together with my Methadone and a lil Lyrica. I was floating so damn nicely. I felt like I wore a bathrobe made of cotton candy. I took a walk and every color was radiating pure pastel joy; music was gently humming and every note like a butterfly alighting in your ear canal.


So there's your cheesy and turgid description (inspired by reading too  much Joyce) of what makes Valium so damn nice, especially with Lyrica together. I took a total of 40 mg today.

Other benzos though are completely boring to me. K-pins especially, I can eat 10mg and feel nothing. Xanax makes me feel nice for like 15 minutes before I hit the floor sleeping. In combination with dope or Lyrica, benzos are super nice though. Just an absolutely beautiful mellow feeling, like you're watching a perpetual rose-colored dusk while bedded in silk or some shit that is super comfy fuck if I know.

91abc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/91abc3/opioids_and_lifting/,59,https://redd.it/91abc3,VirtualAttention,Opioids and lifting,"Of course people who use opioids regularly will experience side effects like vomiting, lack of appetite, lack of drive, unhealthy lifestyle etc. Of course these factors will make it difficult to f.e. hit caloric goals or workout regularly. Moreover if you exercise high then bradycardia and shallow breathing will make you fatigued faster. If you have a withdrawal then you won't even think about going to the gym and will puke your ass out. And so on and so forth.

But are these only reasons for why hitting the gym doesn't go in pair with using opioids? Like for example opioids innately inhibit muscle growth. Or they fuck up your hormones. Or they're catabolic. Or something like that. If you f.e. had other factors in check - you use opioids moderately but still eat enough, exercise regularly and sober, have a good sleep etc. - would it inhibit your gains substantially? And how much?

I use heroin occasionally / moderately - no withdrawals, little to no tolerance. Sometimes I'd binge for three days in a row, sometimes I'd do one moderate shot for a few days straight, sometimes I would not touch dope for two months at all. Realistically I won't be able to stop completely but would like to hit the gym to change something in my life. But I don't know whether there's any merit in hitting the gym while using H in a way I just described.",1532375364.0

She told us she only does meth but will never turn away an opportunity to make some money. Understandable. So my boyfriend lets her know we just want to try a bit and see how the stuff is first so we only want a half. Well....

This chick obviously had no clue what she was getting into and after two days of texting and trying to figure out where to meet her (and avoiding her random streams of calls EVERYTIME she took a hit of meth and became paranoid as fuck) we finally agree to meet at a gas station and grab it from her. Mind you, when we met her we couldn't believe the cops hadn't called on her.....

To understand why I say this, let me explain what my boyfriend and I saw as we pulled into the gas station (which is a Safe Place!). We see her, a 300 pound white chick with half her head shaved, the other half in two foot long rainbow dreads, in an old car lifted with huge rims, no windows at all, and every door of the car is swung wide open as she blasts rap music. She is smoking a swisher and is literally just dancing by herself in the parking lot.  As she see's us pulling in she jumps in her car, takes a hit off her meth pipe (and yes! all the cars door were still open). My boyfriend gets out of the car and starts talking about her stereo, so at least if anyone pulled up he could say he was thinking of buying her stereo, and while they are talking she slips the stuff to me through the car window, I hand her the cash, and we got the fuck out of there. We even told her before all of this that since we've lived in that town we had never seen that gas station not have a cop in it, and she still decide's to pull this crazy shit. Oh well. All's well that ends well.

So any who.

We get home, throw the bag in the freezer for a few minutes and then we weigh it out. We paid $40 expecting a half gram and ended up with .7!! Not only that, but it was pure fire y'all. So we're sitting here thinking ""Fuck yeah! Maybe this crazy chick is worth it."" Well nope! She hit's us up the next day asking what we thought of the product, we told her it was okay and how much an eighth would be. She obviously took a hit off her meth pipe because she immediately starting freaking out saying she would just come by my boyfriend's work and talk because we were being way too specific on messenger...... She was fine with that sentence yesterday.

Well, she went and talked to my boyfriend that night saying that her guy got pissed at her for selling it so cheap to us. She claimed that her dealer sells it to everyone else for $15 a point and that he wants her to sell it like that from now on with no price breaks. My boyfriend's response? ""Well fuck that. I wouldn't have even bought the half if it was more than the $40. I told you I'm not an addict. I don't want it that bad."" And as expected the chick back peddled like crazy saying she would talk to her guy and see if he can make an 'exception' for us.

So obviously this chick told her dealer that she sold the half for $40 and the guy called her a fucking moron and told her how much she could sell it for to an addict. She didn't believe my boyfriend one bit when we told her that we buy in bulk and only do a g or 2 once a month for fun. 

My boyfriend has already received 4 calls from her today with voicemails that range from her crying incoherently to her cussing him out but is yelling a different guy's name. I expect around 2am we will get a coherent answer and the eighth for $120 is still going to be a good deal.",1532373531.0

Passed drug test w Apple juice & banged dope in parkin lot.,"Yea my life's been spiraling out of control really bad since I got out of jail a little over 2 weeks ago. I've been shooting boy & girl and taking xans and smoking meth. I usually don't take bars unless I was in wds bc I've lost so many ppl to it and I get plenty fd up speedballing. I love the combo but I try my best to avoid it and used to do well but this girl I was with was constantly taking them and so I started to as well. I've been smoking meth as well which is not something I was ever been into. I don't like the geeky twacked feeling. Several of the people I run with do it all the time and always offer it to me for free. They will even often give me 2 or 3 pts just trying to look out for me bc I'm blessed to have a couple groups of friends that love me a lot. I've never been one to do people dirty and ive helped them all out when i could and that shit has made me a saint to them. I don't keep friends that try to finesse me or always need my help but show no love so the friends I have help me a ton so yea free meth and shit. Normally I don't do it but lately a lot of times if they offer, I do it. Also once they left me a bag and I did it over the course of some days and didn't sleep and eventually I started hallucinating and it hasn't stopped. I'll see colors slowly change, patterns move little by little and worst of all I'll see a bug or mouse or something run past out of the corner of my eye that doesn't exist. The shooting boy and girl thing I've been doing for a while tho. So yea my life's fucked.

I'm also on probation and haven't been able to give them a legit address since I got out. I can't give them my real address bc everyone here is a felon that does drugs and the owner of the house sells drugs. Out of the house. Lol. I can't even lie anymore bc my aunt was the only person who'd let me lie and use her address but the police have came there and searched for me like 5 times in the last 2 years. I've been fugitive status for like 15 of the last 24 months. 2 separate runs ending with jail. The judge told me if I violate in any way possible he's sending me to prison for the most time he can and he's known for keeping his word. I've been having to say I'm couch surfing and don't have anywhere so she is giving me a couple weeks to sort it out or ""we'll have to discuss other options"". Idk wtf that means but I don't want to find out. And I'm on home visits now instead of reporting.

The good news is I got a job today! I had to use apple juice to pass the drug test. The pay is ok and it'll let me rent somewhere else very soon so I'll get out of the rat infested hell hole I'm in and give my PO my real address. It's dangerous and they don't play on that rent. They bitch about it constantly and I'm 1 week behind and I don't bitch about the rats or mould and shit. And it's not just a couple rats. It's a full on see them in the middle of the day running across the floor in front of ppl infestation now. Anyway, I also got the Xanax chick out of my life and stopped doing any meth. They still offer. I've just got back in my groove of saying no. I still hallucinate some though, especially when sleepy and that's concerning but whatever. Oh I've also tried to cut way back on the speedballs. I've been super reckless since getting out but this is a great step in the right direction. When I move I will probably go to a mdone clinic again bc I can't stay sober permanently at this point and my home boy got a job at the same places as me today and we are renting a place soon and he's not going to stop doin boy and Tina. I can resist the ice but not boy unless I'm on mdone.

He gave a lot of officials shit for being communist or tied to communist. Sometimes he bothered people who had very loose connections to ""communism"" in various forms. His alleged goal was to expose and put a stop to subversive acts.

&nbsp;

In reality, he probably was using the dirt he dug up on people to blackmail them though I have no immediate proof of that, it just sounds about right.

You might even remember a term, ""McCarthyism"" but if not, do not despair. 

&nbsp;

As it would turn out it was determined that the man was addicted to heroin. Well, that explains his energetic fervor in prosecuting his countrymen.

From the Wikipedia article:

> ""McCarthy had also become addicted to heroin. Harry J. Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, became aware of McCarthy's addiction in the 1950s, and demanded he stop using the drug. McCarthy refused.[143] In Anslinger's memoir, The Murderers, McCarthy is anonymously quoted as saying:

'I wouldn't try to do anything about it, Commissioner [. . .] It will be the worse for you [. . .] and if it winds up in a public scandal and that should hurt this country, I wouldn't care [. . .] The choice is yours.'[143]


**Anslinger decided to give McCarthy access to heroin in secret** from a pharmacy in Washington, DC. **The heroin was paid for by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics**, right up to McCarthy's death. 


&nbsp;

McCarthy's death had something to do with Hepatitis, some say it was related to alcoholism but if he was an IV heroin user..  I wonder if it was that.


> 'McCarthy died in Bethesda Naval Hospital on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. His death certificate listed the cause of death as ""**Hepatitis, acute, cause unknown**""; doctors had not previously reported him to be in critical condition. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism, an estimation that is now accepted by contemporary biographers.'

&nbsp;

Sorry if you read this whole thing and though it sucked but you're welcome for your history lesson of the day. I also heard Churchill liked amphetamines but I didn't investigate it too deeply.


OHHH and one more history fun fact! 

Nazi soldiers including members of the Waffen S.S. were issued a pill which combined amphetamines with oxycodone. It should be noted that Hitler did fux with an early form of oxycontin. I'm reluctant to say that the soldiers were issued something containing oxycontin as opposed to oxycodone because I just don't know if they had been given an immediate release formulation. Everything about the drugs given to Nazi soldiers mention oxycodone in the text as opposed to the 'contin. 


So yeah, oxyccodone and methamphetamines. Now, that's how you keep your soldiers soldiering!",1532366412.0

 Why does everyone hate Oxyneos? I personally disliked them because i couldn't snort them. But If you take them orally what would be the difference? I have read that its a very slow release so people have to take double their regular amount to feel anything at all. I had a few a while ago and ate them and although they did seem a bit weak, they still worked. Is it because you can't abuse them you would with IR oxy like sniff, or inject them?  


Can anyone clarify what the cons are to these? More so just for my curiosity since I'm determined to stay sober this time. Thanks",1532362588.0

I volunteered a little over  a month ago to taper down on my pain meds. After more than a month, the wd from the taper should have been gone. It’s not, and I know it’s because my pain is legit and it’s just not manageable under a certain dose of my pain meds. So, I’m going to ask to go back up the 20 mg that I was stopped down. The insurance approving it, is what’s going to be tough. Although, many months ago when we tried to UP my dose, the doctor was all about it, but the insurance wouldn’t do it unless I jumped thru hoops, which I had completed 95% of them, but the only one I didn’t complete was trying to taper down first to see if it was possible to be on less. So, now that I tried to taper (and have went from 180 mg a day of ER morphine down to 100 mg morphine now) they SHOULD be ok with it, right? I’m not asking for a huge increase, just 20 mg. I asked him at my last appt if I could get a break thru med (norco) because 2 weeks a month I’m miserable from my PMPD from my woman cycle, and he said “I’m sorry, the insurance won’t go for it, I already tried with another patient and we went thru the same thing”. So, that’s sucks :/

I'm still pretty on and off with where I go on reddit but spend a lot of time on /r/all along with my own personal drug-riddled front page.

But frankly, I look around at the posts on here and I see lots of people in pain, lots of people temporarily chemically relieving their pain, and lots of people who have made their way out of pain into a better life (some of y'all are well adjusted too). And all those groups of people are here to help one another, to laugh together, to cry together. And it's incredible. 

We make it clear to newbies to not start this life given the option. We push harm reduction as hard as we can. Lots of people here remember the usernames of others. We support eachother when getting clean and when having just picked up alike.

I met a girl several months ago via Reddit after she responded to a post about an activity I was going to attend in her city \[she lives five hundred miles from me\]. She agreed to go with me after my previous companion bailed on me.

If ""love at first sight"" is a trite way to describe it, I can think of no better way to articulate it. This person is incredibly magnetic, and complimentary to my own personality in ways I've never discovered in another human being. Except, of course, for the fact that she is a long-term intravenous heroin user. She first revealed this side to me when she asked to use my hotel bathroom to shoot up, and was as open and honest about her history of use as I might be describing a traffic violation, including her history of prostitution to procure the drug. I was floored by this transparency, having been taught all my life that heroin users are the most duplicitous addicts in existence.

We kept in touch afterwards, and seemed to me like a relationship was fast forming. We talked at length every single day, and about things I would be hard pressed to address  a long-term girlfriend. I made an arrangement to see her in mid-spring, for no particular reason than to visit, and I found her in better spirits than before: she'd been kicked out of her parent's home after they found her rig, but she managed to find a place to stay and, just as importantly, begin dialing down her drug use to a point I was comfortable with it, though I found the use of methadone replacement questionable at best. She was even functional enough to maintain a high-stress job, which I still find incredibly admirable.

It was on this trip that I told her my feelings for her, and she acknowledged she felt the same, though warned me that she was in no place emotionally to pursue any kind of relationship. I understood this; I have long known that heroin users are primarily in a relationship with the needle, and in fact I appreciated her shielding me from her own habits. I have done a little light enabling monetarily, though not nearly to the extent to which I could or would be willing.

We made plans to meet once again just last week. And as before, everything was initially fine - until her roomate kicked her out of her apartment for using. In a hurry, we packed up her things and moved her into the apartment of a \[currently actively using\] couple she'd met at the clinic. Almost immediately something seemed off - they are a deeply toxic couple anyway, and she seemed less than pleased with the arrangement. And I was horrified to discover that they have a dealer who a makes deliveries - part of the reason it was so easy for her to get it under control initially, I think, is because of the distance she had to travel to get her shit.

I've been back home for five days now, and our conversation has ground to a halt. While I am completely understanding of her predicament - her commute to work is quite longer, and she says she is in the process of looking for someplace else to live - I'm not an idiot. I'm metaphysically certain she's using more than she was before, and I'm not sure heroin is all she's using: the head of the household has a taste for meth, which she is inexperienced with despite being a herojin user for a decade

My problem here, essentially, is threefold:

1. Can I trust my instinct that this girl is not manipulating me? I feel that an open and conscious deliberate manipulator would use sex and love - in other words, she'd fuck me and tell me she loved me doing it just to get money if that's all she wanted. But she didn't. We have not had sex, nor are we officially dating, because, she says, she doesn't feel she can do either at the moment. I feel touched by this, as if she is protecting me from herself. It convinces me she's being emotionally honest - but I still have to admit some skepticism, however unwarranted. It's also the case that you can ""kill someone with kindness"", though I believe this operates on a baser, less cognizant level.
2. I offered to move her down here with as much heroin as necessary to make the withdrawal process as painless \[if prolonged\] as possible. She said it was a possibility at the time, but hasn't brought it up since. Have I, in my admittedly juvenile zeal to ""save her from herself"", alienated her by trying to put her in a position where she would feel emotionally obligated to me? I do not want to be an imposition on her. In this I don't care if she'd be using me or not.
3. If I approach this situation with a light touch, as every instinct I have suggests I do, how can I be sure she won't forget about me or blame me somehow when she comes out of this current funk and finds something more stable? Conversely, how can I keep up communications with her without seeming pushy or overbearing? I would give up everything here immediately to be with her if she wanted that. But she has to actually, y'know, want that. ",1532355905.0

[rant],"so I've been sober for about 11 months \[which is why I haven't really been in here\] and I'm just fucking disgruntled right now.  I'm so fed up with this shit and I really am starting to consider that death is really the only way out.

I really, really hate AA and it has never worked for me over the many years that I've been trying it.  it has never given me relief, ever, and I really want to get high right now.  despite having ""done the steps"".

I think the first problem is that I don't believe in god.  any god, gods, etc.  I can't, don't, and won't.  ever.  no matter how hard I try to make believe and pretend and do what is suggested.  praying makes me feel like an asshole and accomplishes nothing for me.  in addition to that, I have hep c and it makes me fucking itchy as fuck all the time.  I'm currently on the wait list for treatment, which is great, but I was recently told to pray about it --  to pray to god to make my medical condition go away.  that's like saying prayer will cure cancer.  like are you fucking serious right now?  I'm totally cool with the idea that ""the universe began in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere,"" which the book warns against as being unacceptable.

\[then she tried to backpedal and say that she recognized my medical condition and it was a real problem I was going through and I'd have to hang in there until I got the treatment.  like okay, so now god can't cure my very real medical problem?  I thought he could two days ago?  and while we're at it and using god to justify everything, if this is god's plan who's to say that it's not god's plan for me to just be a fucking junkie forever?  oh wait, right, we only use god selectively to justify things we like.\]

that kind of sounds like how the program likes to justify failure.  they say those who fail are those who have not ""thoroughly followed"" their path.  like if the program doesn't work for you it's your fault for not trying hard enough?  but guess what, I've tried, repeatedly, like my fucking life depended on it \[and it does\] and guess what -- I still want to get high.  I do not feel any less compulsion.  the desire to use has not been fucking magically removed.  duh, of course it hasn't, probably because making a laundry list of my sexual conduct and praying to an imaginary higher power literally has no effect on the medical condition of having a disease \[addiction\].

I honestly believe that the people who have remained sober and claim that the program saved them are literally just the people who have gone into spontaneous remission.  \[because yes that's a real thing.\]   I've had equal success staying sober on will-power alone and I think I'm actually less miserable that way, because at least I'm not being blamed and told to take responsibility for everything horrible that's happened in my life. \[and yes, while most of it really was my fault some things weren't and I fucking refuse to be victim blamed for shit other people did to me! fuck that!\]

I don't know.  I guess I'm just venting, but let's discuss?

I'd like to hear from people who AA has worked for, as well as people who found other ways.

Since then I’ve relapsed on H once and used plenty of pills when I tore ligaments in my knee. However, it’s been mostly just Kratom, klonopin, and bud on the daily. No opiates.

 Skip forward to late June I caught a felony possession charge and in a moment(moments) of weakness used for about a week. I have court the 26th and even though it’s probably going to be another reset I didn’t want to be strung out in RIC court, starting to already look like a fucking mess. So this time I kicked CT but remembered that my doc prescribed a new medication with my klonopin: hydroxyzine. Some quick googling showed it helped with wds and sure enough it’s taken a lot of the sharpness away, much like clonidine worked well for me in the past.

It’s been very affective in cutting through wd symptoms for me and absolutely anything is welcome when sick. Anybody else have any experience with this drug?

My county is known as one of the worst (best?) opiate counties in the country ('Murica), and I am a casual participant.

Lately we've been getting blue fentanyl pressed pills that were very good, almost like they were produced professionally. They always had consistent dosages and potentacies, never had one with a hot spot or one that was weak, just very consistent which is good for safety if you fuck with this shit.

Anyways, I'm still feeling awesome so sorry for rambling. I'll try to get to the point. 
There was a major bust and two dozen people were indicted, so the pills got hard to find.

So I found what I thought were some of these well missed pills. However when I grabbed them they looked different (slightly different color but I think the same press pattern).

The ones I was used to would lay you out if you did a half with no tolerance. So I drank a glass of grapefruit juice and railed half of one. It was very apparent that it wasn't fentanyl, because those kick in in five minutes flat like a truck and only last an hour (unless you smoke weed with them, which seems to dramatically increase the duration for some reason).

This half didn't do anything after insufflating for about 20 or 30 minutes. I was kinda disappointed but I know actual percs and shit take time to work. So I waited an hour and insufflated the other half with 20mg of adderall. After a half hour I didn't feel much so I continued drinking grapefruit juice and railed a whole pill.

This had me feeling alright but I was kind of underwhelmed. I thought maybe the Addy canceled it out some. That was all I had so after an hour and a half I was bored and kind of sober. So I said fuck it, I'll do 20mg of adderall again. The Addy took about a half hour to kick in. When it did kick in the opiates finally kicked in hard, a full two hours after my last opiate line.

I couldn't keep my eyes open. I write raps and between nods bars were coming out of me effortlessly (well, summoning the motor functions to type them was difficult, but the creativity was flowing). I wrote 5 decent 16 measure verses basically effortlessly over the course of an hour while I was nodding hard. I nodded like that for 2-3 hours, spending more time out than in.

I'm just curious what substance(s) you guys think those pills contained. They took so long to kick in after snorting compared to other opiates I've done, and didn't seem to really kick in until that nice Addy euphoria kicked in, and then it hit like a truck.


Tl;DR- what takes 2 hours to kick in intranasally and is potentiated by ground up 20mg Adderall XRs, with a total duration of over 4 or five hours?

Ps-was an awesome surprise when they kicked in hours later after I had wrote them off as weak

Further notes--made it basically impossible to pee (still can't 5 hours in), also  drank two natty daddies (25oz of 8% malt liquor x2) over the course of the night.

Sorry for the long read, I'm feeling too good to be concise. ",1532321866.0

He smiled when I opened the door, and I smiled back.

“Good to see you, Clyde!”

“Good to see you too, Vic.”

“Mind if I come in for a minute?” I stepped to the side and held my open hand out to invite him in. He confessed, “You know, Clyde, I thought about it all night, and I just can’t give you 200 bucks for those drills.” He looked up and smiled. “I decided that it’s only fair for me to give you 250. How’s that sound?” He laughed and handed me five folded bills.

“Sounds great! I got ‘em in this bag.” I reached behind the couch and pulled it over to hand to the pot-bellied man rubbing his hands. “Here they are. Let me go give some of this to Gabriella. I’ll put some shoes on, and then we’ll go.”

“I’ll be out in the truck.”

I walked to the bedroom. The bag taped over the broken window blew up and in when I opened the door. She was snoring and whimpering under the covers. Her black hair stuck to her forehead where she was sweating on the pillow and the strand of drool from the corner of her mouth had dried leaving flakes of white. I put my hand on her shoulder. She moaned in protest.

“Babes, I’m going to work with Vic. There’s 50 bucks for you here on the nightstand. I’ll be back this evening, like six.”

She didn’t open her eyes. She just pretended to sleep.

“I love you baby. I’ll see you tonight.” I kissed her head and walked out.

Vic introduced me to his son, Vic Junior, sitting in the back seat holding his lunch in a brown paper bag. He didn’t seem to have a neck, just shoulders and tree trunk arms. He stared at the car radio with his mouth open. I said hello. He didn’t say a word. We stopped for coffee and cigarettes at a gas station and rented a trailer around the corner from there. When we got to the job site, Vic put a sledge hammer in Vic Junior’s hands who went to work destroying the walls and sinks and cabinets and doors like they were made of match sticks. Vic Senior limped around with a pair of pliers and cut wires or weakened walls with a reciprocating saw. I carried the debris down the stairs and out to the driveway and threw it into the trailer.

By the time we broke for lunch it was almost halfway full. Vic Junior and Senior sat on a couple of cinder blocks and unrolled their bag lunches. The father pulled another brick up for me to sit on and offered me half of his sandwich. He caught me gawking at his son.

“Had some serious behavioral issues as a kid.” He volunteered.

“Oh?”

“Yeah. He spent most of his childhood in juvenile hall and finally he got in real trouble when he was thirteen. They said he hurt some little kid at a McDonalds. Broke his arm and crushed his orbital socket.”

“What’s that?”

“The bone here,” he pointed to the side of his head level with his eye, “around your eye.”

“Whoah.”

“Yeah. He had some troubles, Junior did. State took him, of course, and when he come back out at 21, this is how they gave him to us. They said they did some procedure and gave him some revolutionary treatment. I’m not sure what all, but he don’t talk no more. He knows what I say and listens to what I tell him, but his personality’s gone, reminds me of Frankenstein.”

“I can see that.”

“You’d be blind if you didn’t.”

“How’d you get this job, Vic?”

“Few years back, one of my neighbors, a middle-aged lady, who knew I did some construction asked me if I’d help her father change his toilet. So I say, sure. You know? Come over here and there’s this old guy named George, her father, and he wants me to change his toilet. And I ask him what’s wrong with the one he’s got. You know? *Is it leaking George or what’s wrong with it?* He tells me he wants a deeper bowl to sit on because every time he sits on the one he’s got, his balls touch the water. Haha! Said he was tired of his balls sitting in cold water every time he sat on the pot.  Haha!”

“No way! Really? That’s hilarious.”

“Yeah. So, we did, you know? And I guess he died a few months ago. Now his daughter asked me to come knock the interior out completely. Guess they’re gonna do some kind of remodel and live here or sell it once it’s all fixed up. I don’t know. They never told me all that, but I was happy to do it.”

Vic and I finished eating and pulled out our packs of cigarettes. He had Pall Mall Red 100s. I smoked Camel Filters as a matter of choice, but when my addiction got heavier and money got tighter I smoked anything. While we smoked, he pulled a baggie from his pocket and a pack of papers out of it to roll up some weed. I did a double take.

“Hey, Vic, I thought you were in the program. You know working the steps and all that. I always assumed you were an old timer in the meetings.”

“I am.”

“But you smoke weed?”

“You know, I had a really bad IV coke habit when I was younger, but I got sober to get into the military after I met Junior’s mother. I was 31 when I came home from Desert Storms. I was on the pain pills real bad back then.”

“You get hurt?”

“Friendly fire. One of our own planes flew down on our little convoy and ripped us up. Killed a bunch of us. I just took one in the foot. Well, I shouldn’t say *just took one in the foot.* It shattered all of the bones in there. Now I walk like it’s made of a 4x4 or something, huh? But, I had my struggles with addiction, real struggles. It was crazy. Junior’s mom died when he was six, and I got worse than ever before. The rooms helped me for a while. I worked some of the steps. They’ll tell you it’s the only way, you know, to work all 12 steps and keep your sponsor and sponsee, all that, but I was done about halfway through step three. Flushed all my pills one afternoon and never went back to them. Course, Junior’s mother is dead and an old man like me, well, he gets lonely if you know what I’m saying. There’s a lot of women at those meetings. So, I still go. Smoking pot is my business.  They don’t need to know all that.”

I nodded. We got back to work. Towards the end of the day, I ended up in an old bedroom that was part of the attic. No one had been up there in years. It had a window and, in the sill, sat an old composition notebook covered in dust and dead insects and wisps of white cob web. I grabbed it and waved it through the air trying to shake off the dead bugs and dust. When I was a kid, I used to build castles and forts out of all the different shaped building blocks and created what I know now are called avatars out of figurines, like they were little versions of myself or characters who I controlled in the castle. Even though I could see myself moving them and talking for them as a kid, they couldn’t see me. I was this invisible giant controller. I would put random articles in their vicinity for them to interact with. They wouldn’t have known where they came from. They wouldn’t know they were intentionally left there by me. They didn’t know a crazy 4-year-old kid named Clyde held their lives and fate in his hands. I wondered if I was just some invisible and giant child’s avatar myself, walking around in a house he’d made of building blocks. Was this book something he'd intentionally placed before me? I wouldn’t have known the difference.

I opened it and read from the hand-written ink parts of a story about a cabinet maker with a big nose who ended up living at one of his clients’ houses. In the morning the family would be cooking breakfast, but when they looked out the window, there was the big nosed, long haired cabinet maker smoking a joint or brushing his teeth in the bushes with the garden hose. He smoked really terrible weed and was a terrible nuisance in general. The story made me laugh, so I tucked the notebook into my waistband and walked back downstairs. We worked another half hour before Vic told me to wrap it up. We got into the truck. We rode listening to oldies on the radio. The old man sang along when he knew the words.

I got out the truck at Gabriella’s house and told Vic that I was thankful for the work again. He showed me his palm and put his head down in humility. He told me it was nothing, that he was thankful to me. Back in the house, all the lights were on, and it looked like Gabriella had gone through a short-lived phase of wanting to remodel one of the living room walls. Instead of a sledge hammer though, she’d used two chairs from the kitchen, which both sat on the ground by the wall, each with its legs broken off. There were flecks of white paint and and even small biscuits of plaster and pieces of popcorn from the ceiling scattered in the green carpet. The blackened bottom half of a sprite can and two dismantled syringes sat next to a lighter and an empty bag on the soot streaked lamp stand next to the couch.

In the kitchen, the AM radio blared the blabbering of two talk show hosts on two different stations bleeding in over each other. Gabriella folded at the waist like a taco like she was trying to touch her nose to her big toe. Her black hair and the backs of her hands lay draped on the linoleum floor. Her feet pointed away towards the stove, so I could see her face. She looked like she’d scratched her cheeks with her finger nails, like she was trying to claw her face off. It seemed like the kind of thing she might do. There was a large pot of meatballs and red sauce on the stove top. It had already boiled over and splattered the floor and walls and cabinets with the sauce now black and set like glue. *Is this the fourth or fifth batch of meatballs she’s made since I’ve known her?* I asked myself. She must have cooked 20 meatballs in every pot. Times four, that’s 80 meatballs, but I never saw her eat one. I know I never ate any. Where did they go? How come she just kept making meatballs?

I turned the stove top off and grabbed her iphone on the counter and walked to the living room. She was nodded out harder than I had seen her yet. That notebook was still in my waistband. I wanted to read more of it, so I went to sit on the couch. Victor had given me a joint before he dropped me off. It was the chronic.",1532310895.0

I reconnected with my neighborhood friend (we were 5 when we played together)  a year ago. We fell in love... Hard. He was to be my husband, me - his wife. He told me about prior usage /jail, etc... I didn't care, I saw his heart and soul. Long story short  - he fucks  up and OD's a few times.  I always collect him because - love. He went to rehab, did wonderfully, came back  home to us. He was getting vivitrol, yet the  clinic allowed him to self administer. (On probation, had passes to come to me, neighboring state so pharmacy would fill, ship,  and shit). Long story short, he skipped his last vivitrol injection. Due 8 June. Lied.  He was found  dead in his car on 3 July. Probably died 2 July/1 July from the decomp smell of his belongings. 
Do what you will with this  story, I loved him. So many lies, and secrets, but under that... He DID love me too. He was a slave to this shit. Guess my point is - everyone has SOMEONE who loves them, pls talk to US!  We Will never judge and always help!  Please be safe, everyone. Whether you wanna believe it or not, you're loved and people CARE! He likely thought after so many months clean (almost 6),  that he no longer needed that shot - OR - he just glorified it all, and wanted to go back. No way to know

It burned to snort, which normal oxy doesn’t. It definitely felt strong in the beginning and had a nice rush, but it didn’t last long (which I believe is in line with fent expectations).

Walking, and talking to myself;


It helps to keep the fear in caskets 


So that the dead will stay dead 




Catatonic direction in low light 


The sun doesn't reach these places 


Claustrophobic attraction to the night 


I fall to my knees and beg to stasis 




""I can't find my way out of this place now""


I jump at how desperation sounds in the underneath 


I realise I'm just talking to myself again 


And I walk on, finding no map nor relief 




Dusty life once walked these low halls 


I try to find solace in that thought


I am not alone, and I hear a calling 


From the coffin I pass; as an afterthought 




""You are not alone"" the dead voice crooned


""Who are you?"" I panick, I already knew


That voices reflective rotting- leather tone


It chuckled, opening the coffin ""I am you""




I saw the empty socket of a dead eye 
emerging, and ran


""Don't go down that way"" I heard 


From a distance I swear it mournful 


Continuing I walk and talk, undeterred.

Except this shit is different. Now for a quick backtrack, I’ve been buying “dope” from this guy for a while which unfortunately in my neighborhood is almost always fent/cut or fent/dope/cut. Now I know fent can be a cold mistress due to it lacking that warm hug from God euphoria that a good shot of heroin provides but this shit I copped today is something else.

I'm having a hard time getting a rush/high from the bags. His shit is definitely not bunk because it gets me well and my pupils pinned but I can't get a rush and I don't get that care free, feel good feeling that makes dope my favorite drug. The bags also draw up in the rig as clear as water. It's hard to describe. Its like all the physical effects of dope are there but not the mental. All the bad shit like not being able to make my dick work and raspy voice are present but without the euphoria that makes me not care.

Fucking sucks. Now I know fent can lack euphoria but is it possible to have NO euphoria or even general mood lift? I’m about to go to a family party and there is no reason why I should be in such a bad mood. I’ve got 6 bags in my pocket, these are suppose to be the good days.

I'm so tired.

Sooo tired.

I am sick and in pain all the time, and I can no longer go through life like this. I don't have money for heroin anymore. Pain, horrible physical and mental pain all the time. That's what bi-polar is; that is, at least my bi-polar. The inability to feel pleasure, and the amplification of pain, melancholy, and basically every negative emotion know to man. Over 10 years of doctors, and not an iota of help. The fact of the matter is that there is no solution. I am nothing but a burden on everyone. I do nothing but hurt those I love. There is no legal cure for me, and I cannot afford to fix myself.

Even though my tolerance is miniscule, maybe 1-1.5 bags a day, I have been an IV addict for so long that the withdrawals are excruciating. As I mentioned, I am bi-polar, and I finally get just the right insane episode I had been waiting for. Finally, it is time. I pop bunch a of benzos, to take my fear away. Benzos have always made me feel suicidal, reckless, and fearless, so this will help take the final step for certain.

I steal a ...lethal object. Insurance policy.

A number of public transportation switches later, I finally make it to the hood, and call my guy. I am very sick at this point, and so eager for the relief of death. My dealer has been 100% reliable and sold me excellent quality dope for over 6 months now. I buy 12 bags. I notice he is gray and strange looking, but I dismiss that. 

I walk a couple blocks to my ""nest"" - the bushes alongside the I-90 highway where I can hide and do my dope. It is littered with scores of needles, and I survey the scene and smile, thinking of each moment of pleasure, or rather, each moment free of pain, that each of those needles represent. It is a peaceful area. It seems like a nice place to die, and with little chance of anyone finding me and resuscitating me.

I already took a large number of benzos, and I take some more. I make two shots, out of the 12 bags, one 8 bag shot, and one 4 bag shot. I assume the benzos, combined with my ~1 bag a day tolerance means that death and final peace will be certain.

I always thought, those people who write suicideletters don't really want to die. Or who make a big fuss and long standing threats about it. They do those things because they want something, perhaps something they can't have, or perhaps something they can, such as revenge. But a tired soul wants nothing but peace. When animals sense their mortality, they go under the porch, or find some other comfortable spot, and stay there until it is over. Same with humans who really want to die. 

No note, no phone calls, no threats, and no warnings - just a lone young man sitting on the ground, ecstatic for the final release of pain.

First the 8 bag shot into the arm, followed quickly by the 4 bag shot IMed into the thigh. 

I am so happy. Happier than I've ever been in my life (without heroin that is). I'm so eager, I'm so excited. This is a dream come true. 

I sit there.

I wait.

I wait.

I wait.

Nothing. 

Try to imagine that. To be certain of death. To anticipate a sensation that will take the pain away and end the nightmare of life. To wait. To wait. Where is it? WHERE IS IT?

As it turns out, my gray, 6 month-reliable dealer turned into a junkie himself, and ripped me off.

I thought that adding low dose of speed into the mix could mitigate some of these side effects. For example make you less sleepy and dilate your pupils a little.

This literally just popped into my mind and thought it was interesting. 

So if you don't know, A Clockwork Orange is about a kid named Alex who gets arrested for murder and chooses to undergo an experimental process in hopes of a commuted sentence.

Only the process leaves him completely incapable of doing any wrong; as in it makes him physically ill and incapacitated. If someone starts shit with him and he thinks about retaliating, he buckles and vomits.

The process also has an unintended effect on his love for classical music, specifically Mozart.

I had a thought that vivitrol and to an extent buprenorpheine are akin to the Ludovico process Alex undergoes.

The main theme of the book shows when the prison priest talks to Alex after he undergoes the process telling him, ""If a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a man.""

Saying, at least as far as the book is concerned, that if we could, it would be wrong to force someone to be ""good"" by taking away their choice to be bad. Which is kinda where my mind goes when I think about vivtrol.

The idea sounds good, but I've heard others talk about being a prisoner in your own mind, and I feel like if I've been subconsciously using dope to dull the depression I feel and suddenly I'm incapable of achieving that past feeling, id probably jump from out of a window.

I feel it takes on a greater parallel if you think about drug court and how we're forcing those who get caught holding or using to get on vivtrol themselves.

Here is my pathetic one.,"I recently was at Bowling Green Brandywine which is an hour or so outside of Philly. I had typed up a huge story but deleted it. Instead here is a bullet point run down...

- Leave Tuesday evening expecting my emergency contact to come get me. (They dont give you your phone or let you make a phone call if you AMA)

- Emergency contact or brother cant come get me. I spend the entire night outside the facility.

- Wednesday AM they let me back in.

- About to fall asleep around 1pm but new roommate comes in and says he needs me to leave room so he can bring girl in to fuck. 

- Pissed off, still havent slept. My boy and I decide to leave around 6pm or so. Going on 36 hours no sleep on top of withdrawal.

- 20 minutes into walk dehydration and no sleep sets in I flag down car to call ambulance since im feeling like im going to pass out even though my heart rate felt insanely high.

- My boy comes with me on ambulance. I basically had a panic attack most likely due to dehydration, no sleep, and anxiety from withdrawal.

- Hospital is farther away from Philly. We are now an hour and 20 mins or so away.

- Using phone at hospital he cant get ride and my ride cant get me.

- I have 40 bucks on me but no where to go. We find out our path home is a bus that comes to hospital at 6am. Goes to West Chester Station. From there Septa takes us to 69th street station or whatever. Then the L all the way to allegheny.

- There is no place to lay down at hospital. Luckily they let us stay there overnight though.

- I still had not slept, by 6am that morning when the bus came I was on 48 hours no sleep. We finally got to Philly. Copped dope (fentanyl of course since that is all that seemingly exists in kenzo these days). We both were finally able to get separate rides home around noon that day. 

- 54 hours of no sleep while in withdrawal + an ambulance ride and hospital visit that will probably cost me 10k in bills, but I made it home  and then regretted it once I got there.

- Currently planning on getting back on methadone maintenance.

- Anyone else have any crazy experiences leaving a rehab?",1532278646.0

Started snorting H and I never looked back. I would take random breaks each time I hit rock bottom, and I would stay sober planning my relapses. I never thought I could find happiness or hope in the world outside of dope. It’s been seven years of accepting that dope is the only thing I enjoy. Of accepting the inevitable OD that would end everything for me. Seven years of complete and utter apathy towards the people and events around me. 

But then something happened. I had two days sober where I was just shown, briefly, that things can make you happy away from dope. I had given up on that idea after I snorted that first line. I knew it then.

Read below. Wanna just leave what helped you through the withdrawal? ESPECIALLY RLS AND BACK PAIN. Go for it you beautiful fuck.**

Wanting to die is fucking **hilarious.**

My last line was Friday. 

Codeine crushed, watered and up the bung was keeping me ready to human on Saturday. Long legs, worth the discomfort — wasn’t working orally anymore. 

Sunday I had a mental breakdown and realised I had to quit. I’ve done it all and been to the brink of every substance — nothing grabs you like opiates right? 

I went home to kill myself. Almost died driving home. 

Arrive home and I instead have a terrifying DMT trip where I didn’t breakthrough like last time and instead felt like I was suffocating for ten minutes. 

Best thing ever. My mortality is back. Nothing like the strongest psychedelic to remind you about the void that is death. No ego death like last time but wow, hi death, nice to meet you; you’re a cyclical force and I respect you. It’s like the DMT kicked me in the balls. Tough love. Thank you spirit molecule. You surround me everywhere I go and are always there to kick my ass. 

I’m 23. Leaving for my mum’s place tomorrow.  She deals with us fuck up’s for a living. Fuck kicking it in a hospital right? I’ll be in a room with Netflix and a doctor prescribed way out. 

I won’t have weed for a few days but wow — only way to get sleep against restless legs right? Don’t even like the high at all but it helps withdrawal AMAZINGLY. Way better than Valium. 

Any other help for that? **The back pain makes me squirm and is by far the worst symptom**

I’ve broken a lot of bones. Almost died as a kid too many times to count by chance of life. 

**NOTHING** has been as painful as this restless legs zero sleep opiate withdrawal bullshit. It brings anyone to their knees, crying. 

I guess Valium helps but eh... I’m probably going to just get a bunch of Xan’s and sleep it out forever. 

I’m doing 0.5g every 4-5 days. It costs about $250 for 0.5g where I live. Yep. And this is THE shit. A 1mg line once had me nodding for hours at the start. No fent. But at that price — I don’t think many people make it years in around here like in the USA. 

Anyway. Once I hit clean... I shall be trying antidepressants until something works for me. 

Talk therapy — not so much. My support system is great. Took my whole life but they exist so don’t give up if you haven’t found yours guys. 

A guy I pay to call the wrong name in the waiting room and is paid to listen to me speak? He should at least gimme some gas money the fuck. 

I did extra H that day just for him. I may call and reconcile — he has called 7 times to his credit. Professional. 

Never IV’d. Didn’t get the rush. Probably for the best. So I’m thinking I can get away. 

Will I relapse? Probably. According to what I’ve read here, it’s part of the process. 

Opiates are heaven. Opiates are hell. 

What be your advice?

I’ve tried using google before y’all jump on me. This is very specific I feel like.

I experienced this intense whole body soreness, lack of balance thing before I got on subs a few days ago and at first it completely took away these symptoms and I felt great, second day still feeling pretty great, the last 2 days the dose just isn’t doing the trick it seems like? All these symptoms are back full force.  I called my doc because I see him in a few days but wanted to know how to proceed and he said your body needs to adjust to the drug and “take another half” if need be.

Anyway since this is the only place you guys will get this im just type it out for shits n giggles. 

Got kicked out of my clinic at 30mg had about id say 15-20mg from saving some take homes. 
Last dose of that was Friday idk the mg I was taking a oral syringe and I’m not sure if it’s 1mg/1mL. Highly doubt it. Anyway I did about less than 2ml and benzos to potentiate it. So id assume that was probably 10mg or less. 
I have 2 pretty large benzos scripts or there’s no way I’d get through this. Valium is a god send. 
ANYWAY today will be 72 hours no methadone. I could of probably inducted yesterday scored a 20 on cows but I was home alone and really scared of the PWDS so took a few Valium and went to sleep. 
Just woke up and Valium def still in my system. Have all the withdrawals except muscle pain and stomach pain. (I did eat twice through this and it did not end well so I’ve sworn off food) but still get random stomach cramps. 
Anyway once the Valium wears off I’m gonna do about 1mg. See how I feel in an hour. Do 2mg and so on. 

Really siked to get this monkey off my back. Excited to stop paying $600 a month to the clinic and waiting in line like fucking cattle. (No diss it did save my life there for a minute)

But yeah pretty excited! Hope everyone here is doing well. And hopefully I’m not back in a few months asking for someone to mail me rigs 😂. 

TLDR: inducting on subs today after week long methadone taper. Really excited. And I have subutex which I hear is a lot better than suboxone. So yeah everyone wish me luck ! Love you guys ❤️❤️❤️❤️",1532265165.0

I woke up a little over an hour ago (5 am) with a slight case of the sniffles. I decided to do the most responsible thing for anyone in my situation to do and go do a shot. My girlfriend was still asleep so I proceeded into the back room. 

I get my bags out and empty 5 into the cooker. More than enough to get back to sleep comfortably. So I pull up half a cc and as im putting the water bottle back down I hear a phone ringing in the other room. My girlfriend is a nurse, and tonight she was on call. I didn't hear her pick it up so I put my rig down and walked back into the bedroom. I wake her up and have her call her work back and listen to the call just out of a boyish curiosity. The calls are usually pretty interesting about some resident at her work getting fucked up somehow. 

So I finish that up and walk back into the back room. I sit down crossed legged on the single couch coushon which has become my favorite fixing up spot. I tie off, and for the first time in the past 3 days hit a vein on my first poke. I push off, sit still for 30 seconds, and feel nothing. Well that's dumb. I chalked it up to a miss, even though there was no burn, no bubble, no resistance on the plunger. Oh well. I go back to bed...

No. Fuck that, I still have the sniffles, and my brain is telling me that my legs feel funny. I guess I'm doing another shot. The check was 500 dollars more than normal last payday anyways. Thanks John Hancock and the crew for double time on a twelve hour shift. 

I grab the empty pack of cigarettes that my bags are in. I had a tough time getting my nailless fingers underneath the corner of my overly taped half pack. I frustratingly take the razor blade, slice the sky blue paper open, and slide out a bundle. Take out 5 bags, flick em once and rip the 5 tops off. I grab the first bag, and as I'm about to empty it I look into the cooker and see a pile of dope. Five bags worth of dope. 

Being so god damn out of it when I woke up, combined with the fact that the fent-heavy, heroin-lacking shit I've been getting mixes up so clear, I didn't even realize my first shot was straight water. So I throw 3 more bags in, since I had already accepted the fact that I was gonna be down another half b, and I treated myself to a nice shot. Of course since there was actually dope in it, it took me 10-15 minutes to hit, but now I'm feeling great!

I have been in a handful of car accident's . Long story short been on pain management since I was 20 years old . Am 25 now . I've been on and off oxycodone for 5 years now. I decided to stop cold turkey 2 years ago when one of my docs out of the BLUE put me on 100 mcg fentanyl patches and still my oxys. I didn't get the rush / euphoria from fentanyl felt zombie like . Came off of it real quick . I have gone through 2 MEMORABLE  OXY withdrawals. You know the kind . trembling, twitching , restlessfuckinglegsyndrome  , sweats , etc btw currently am prescribed 4 15's a day . Green M boxes . And promethazine for nausea due to the oxy. My tolerance is ridiculously high so on average I double up all doses. ANYWAYS I apologize for going off topic. I was sick and tired of being imprisoned by the pills . I am married have a toddler and corporate executive. I told my doc I wanted to get off completely and he said it's not a good idea to stick to the program. I am in the medical field myself and I am furious he says this to me because the physicians get a percentage from big pharma reps from each script that is written monthly. With that said I decided to wean off with the help of my husband . This is where am at now . Today I went 30 hours with ZERO opiate . And I'll be honest with you . The only reason why I took it is because I couldn't stand the fucking depression anymore . I feel like a shitty wife because I told my husband "" you know what baby give me a green am in alot of pain and in withdraw "" him trusting me blindly gave me a 15 immediately. What I am confused about is No it didn't give me that euphoria we know and love . All it did was give me a sense of hey ! Your alive! Get up and play games at Peter piper pizza with your kid ! ( That's where I was ) BTW I've been working on weaning myself for over a month now.  In the beginning of me weaning it was horrendous but I had a shit load of tramadol help me with the aches and pains and mental shit . Tramadol doesn't do A GODDAM THING FOR ME when it comes to euphoria . It might as well be Tylenol . Just FYI . I also have tried kratom in between . A week ago my husband was splitting my greens . So twice a day 7.5 mg of oxy . And I was fine . No euphoria but I was functional. Then just 7.5 once a day and started to feel like I was pushing it the depression hit deep just the craving. Then somehow we decided it was to low and I was to depressed so we went to the full 15 for the day . Which works fine . Keep in mind I want to be off off of these COMPLETELY. here's the main question and the reason for this post . Since I can go 24/30 + hours from last oxy dose and NOT feel the sweats or shivers or twitching or restlessfuckinglegsyndrome or diahreaa etc when before I was weaning off 6 hours would pass and my nerves we're SHOT 12 hours would pass and I would be in FULL BLOWN WITHDRAW. So does this mean due to the almost 2 months that I've been weaning off that I might be able to just stop ? Just to reiterate today I was already at 30 hours of no oxy and I was not in withdraw no symptoms nothing . It was the mental anxiety of me feeling like I just NEEDED something . Am convinced it could've been a fucken placebo and I would've been the same . I wasn't in withdraw but I also wasn't myself .... I was just a walking talking X person . No humor , no fun, no silly , no nothing ... Just present with no presence. I feel like shit for lying to my husband saying I was in pain and in withdraw etc but he's never been on any opiates and am grateful for it but I just wish he understood . I hate being a LEGAL DRUG ADDICT . The fact that I have a prescription and you don't or do doesn't make a fucking difference this shit is liquid heroin.  And in a life of corporate medicine you feel like you need it to get by the sad corruption you see. I am 25 years old and have been a Chief Marketing Officer for an extremely large medical corporation since I was 21. Since I was able to go multiple times 30+ hours with no oxy and no withdraw symptoms my question is am I still dependent or did I succeed in surpassing the withdrawal and this is just opioid depression??  Their is so much more to my story but I really just want this question answered and advise so I know if I just push a little harder and fight the anxiety or if their are more options . Thank you reddit ! I truly appreciate what feels like a lifeline . 

I APOLOGIZE FOR THE LONG POST BEING IN A CORPORATE POSITION I HAVE NOT A SINGLE SOUL EXCEPT MY HUSBAND I CAN TALK TO ABOUT THIS AND HE HAS NEVER EVEN DONE A PILL SO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.  ",1532245442.0

I just need to put this somewhere where people MIGHT understand and have advice. 

I'm 40 days clean from my DOC. Can't really say I'm ""clean"" because I've picked up kratom in the past few days (but will likely drop it again since it's doing jack shit for me). 

I don't WANT to be clean anymore. And this isn't a passing feeling. Everything is shit right now. I'm in constant pain. I don't trust doctors anymore. I've just been through a major loss (death) in my life, and honestly, there's only one really important thing that is keeping me tethered to life right now. 

If I wasn't needed, if I didn't have someone I love more than my own life depending on me, someone who I would do anything for, I'd take all the risks, try to cold cop and probably get robbed or jumped, risk a fent overdose, all on the off chance that I might actually score and finally feel a little relief from this constant misery because I'm just so fucking tired of feeling like shit all the time. 

I'm on antidepressants. They help somewhat, but I'm starting to think there's just nothing in this world that will relieve my pain (both physical and emotional) like opiates, and outside of kratom, which isn't working and I'm already taking stupid amounts in desperation), I have no access. 

I'm too chicken shit to try to cold cop. I'm naive, and I'd get scammed in a millisecond at the least and probably fucked up hurt because I don't know the ""rules"" and I wouldn't even know where to go. Beyond asking a panhandler, I'm fucking clueless. 

Thought about the darknet, and I would try it if I thought the chances of getting caught were low enough. I'd especially try it if I didn't have my one motivation to keep living because I know my chances of getting something pressed and overdosing would be high. 

I don't actually want to die, mainly because I'm needed. I am not at the ""rock bottom"" that I read and hear about so often. I have a lot going for me. But it's just constant, unrelenting misery, day in and day out. 

I have shit to do, and I have people who need me to be okay. And I'm not okay. 

I've never done heroin, but if a kind stranger walked into my house right now with some, knew what they were doing, and said they were going to give me a shot of some, I'd take it in a heartbeat. 

After the recent death of someone close to me, a family member told me about all the pills she has and acted like she was going to help me through this rough time. Then, she kept stringing me along until finally, I gave up and realized I would get nothing from her no matter what I offered. I don't know why the fuck she told me all about them and said she'd help me if she wouldn't. 

Again, I'm fucking naive. I have no idea what I'm doing. And I can't afford to get caught, go to jail, or lose my life all because people I love need me. 

So still, I sit here 40 days into misery, not really withdrawal (though I'm sure there is some PAWS going on), but just the pain I have from my condition, knowing I can't trust any doctors to help me without putting me on some obscenely long waiting list or putting me through urine tests and contracts all while they under-treat me. I'm just fed up. 

I don't even know what heroin is around here (and I know I can't reveal my location - but I've read enough on this sub to know that different areas of the country have different ""types"", so to speak, but again, I know nothing). 

I feel like I've been sentenced to a lifetime of constant misery because I'm too chicken shit to risk doing the things I would need to do to get what I need to feel better, but I'm past the actual acute withdrawals and learned that, yep, this is real fucking pain I have, and it's unbearable. 

I hate the opiate epidemic and the bullshit laws they're passing. I hate that I can no longer trust the medical field (I mean, this family member who died, she died really fucking young, and there were major mistakes made with her care that led to her early demise.)

Is this all there is? Fuck sobriety. Fuck being clean. But not really because unwillingly, I have to stay that way. And I'm so fucking sick of it. 

Where was my honeymoon period? Where is the promise that the pain I felt every day from being dopesick would abate and my ""real"" pain wouldn't be that bad? I'm still waiting, and that promise isn't being kept. Kratom has only been a very recent addition, and only out of sheer desperation. I know it's not bullshit because I felt enough on it to know that something was hitting opiate receptors, but I'm still in unbearable pain, and I can't just keep taking more and more and more. 

I'm so pissed and ragey because I know that if this country looked at the opiate epidemic and pain in a better way, I know that if I could find medical professionals who aren't running scared, who would see me as a patient, a person in actual pain, instead of a chart and a risk to their license because I dare to have a condition that causes pain, if these medical professionals could find the right opiate to prescribe me that would actually treat my pain and help me maintain without my tolerance skyrocketing, I'd be in much better shape. 

Again, this isn't just a passing craving or feeling. This is constantly how I feel as long as I'm awake. 

I hate it and I'm so tired and done. But I have to keep on truckin' because people need me. 

Fuck all of this, though. ",1532230956.0

(Haven’t been sober that long),"Here’s a little background I have done a lot of opiates in big amounts, like the rest of you lol 

Anyway I used to take 200 mg of morphine, 10 mg of Vicodin, and 50 mg of tramadol. But when the tramadol ran out and the morphine was scarce I only had Vicodin and oxy I would cwe a whole 60 5mg vicodin script and drink that over a period of 1 1/2 days or so, along splitting 15 mgs oxy nasally with each dose, as before it stopped working but this time I stopped feeling everything except the itch and pain relief from high doses, I started smoking and boofing h, still no effects, so I went to rehab for a month, I went through hell but was given immodium which sort of helped, anyways I digress, I got out and the first day went back to my old games I didn’t want to cwe so I took 60 mg of Vicodin, nothing 10g of kratom, nothing 120 mg of oxy snorted, nothing, so I had been trying to get a nod once a months ever since I got back

Last night went like this
T00:00 180 mg robocough 
As a potentiator heard it would lower tolerance as well
T00:45   50 mg dph
Starting to feel the robocough took dph for itch
T01:00 600 mg lyrica
Robocough becoming apparent now took lyrica as another potentiator and bc I love the high
T01:30 25 mg Vicodin 
barely felt lyrica, robo is hitting me good 
T01:45 20 mg ritalin 10 mg orally 10 mg snorted 
Buzzing off the lyrica getting tired, not much boost in energy but get the tingles in my head
T02:30 25mg vicodin
 Was surprised to feel so warm and fuzzy off such a low dose, I’m grinning ear to ear tryna type but occasionally forgetting everything I was doing, the ritalin was keeping me from keeping at this point as the effects from it were so subtle the lyrica robo and vicodin just felt to good not to make the most of it
T03:00 Yerbamate 150 mg caffeine a coffee ??mg
I know the second dose hasn’t hit much yet but I start to nod, it worried me how often I was going out of it, my friends would try to talk to me and shake me to wake me up like 2-3x every five minutes, was worried the next dose would be dangerous, the caffeine barely helped anything but made me feel safer
T03:45 
Everything’s fully kicked in, I am constantly nodding off having funny hypnagogic dreams, I was watching archer and thought it was about a sandwich or something and it made sense until I was woken up 
T04:00 went ham on dab pen
This just put me in another state of fucked up I could barely move or keep my head up I hadn’t felt this euphoric since my first dose ever I cried, I was having the most blissful experience ever 

I will not add anymore from here as nothing interesting happened, if you read it thanks lmao I just needed to share this with everyone because it turned a months worth of bullshit into an amazing night of no worries or problems

I am looking for someone who has actually done this before.

I induced suboxone on Thursday with 2mg.  Then took 2mg Friday morning and 2 more mg's Friday afternoon.  Then this morning I took 4mg,  I got home from work with horrible cravings and caved into getting a half G of H.  Im in the middle of finishing it right now but am filled with fucking regret that I fucked up again and have to start all over again on my suboxone taper.  Or do I?  Can I finish off this half tonight and still continue taking suboxone tomorrow?

For what its worth I DO feel the H.  Nothing special of course but its not totally blocking the H as much as I was expecting/has in the past so thats a factor to take into question too.

I had paid him last night and he says to me “I had to hide your money so Bambi didn’t get at it to buy the OCs” 

My jaw dropped I said wtf and asked him why he never told me he could get them. He said he didn’t know and we laughed for a minute. I took my wallet out and handed him cash to go get me some OC. 

An hour later “Bambi” was blowing my phone up. I call her back and she tells me “Bob doesn’t know that OCs are code for H and I don’t really get OCs. Call him and tell him you don’t want them or my guy is gonna come over with H and Bob can’t see what it really is!!!!” 

So this whole time when she calls her guy or has Bob call her guy for OC ... it’s not. He’s bringing H. 

I called Bob told him to forget it and just get me whatever percs he can find. He’s a nice old guy and he said he was so happy to get me OCs and asking why I changed my mind. I don’t know if he’s on to her or not but I just kept it cool and told him his OC guy takes too long.

Mainly oxycodone, a bit of H here and there, etc. Once every second week on average, so I have little if any tolerance. 30mg of oxy gets me wrecked. 


Up until recently I’d never really heard of suboxone / subutex, until today while having a chat with a friend that was ‘smashed as fuck on bupe’. He gave me an 8mg strip to try it out, but googling hasn’t had answers to the questions I have, in fact it’s created more lol 


Does it get you high if you’re a non-tolerant user? What if you’re an addict? If so, what does it feel like? 


What’s the purpose of Naloxone being in it? Is it just to deter abuse? If so, how? As far as I know bupe isn’t effected by naloxone to a significant extent. My friend snorts it or puts it under his tongue, which would also lead to the naloxone being absorbed. Considering the very low BA of oral naloxone, what happens if you eat the strip? 


Why is it given to addicts if it gets you high? Is it to safely taper or another reason? 


I think that’s all I’ve got for now, I’ll edit if more questions come to mind. Thanks in advance for any information!

This is the first time I've had taken Zubsolv since I've last stopped taking dope 3ish weeks ago. Had 'em before, no complaints. A little confusion about the size of the dosage. Is the 5.7mg really the same as 8mg due to a formulation which facilitates more efficient absorption? This very post might just shed light on that question. 


&nbsp;

Been on a consistent 2mg dose for over a week. I was mostly taking the 8mg stop signs and cutting them up into quarters with the help of a pill cutter. These pills often crumble easily when using anything less suited for the task. Since I'm using a Sunday to Saturday compartmental pill case, I can easily store crumbs if I don't get a perfectly clean cut with the enclosed blade apparatus. 


&nbsp;

I typically put each pill or it's crumbs directly into one of the seven compartments but I will sometimes use a small amount of foil for the more pulverized of the bunch. This is to prevent the dust from disappearing through the cracks in the clicking door-like covers and other unforseeables. If I had strips instead of pills, although I've been known to stick strips straight into their respective compartments, I almost always wrap them in a small folded piece of foil.

Well, about an hour and a half after my dose, 1/4 of a 5.7mg Zubsolv, I feel fine. A little buzzy too, I don't know if I'd actually call it a buzz, but like I said - buzzy. Yeah, a light buzz seemed to come on stronger for a brief moment. It has some legs.


Point is, maybe this stuff really does absorb more efficiently or perhaps it is stronger. Maybe there's another factor at play here.

&nbsp;


As many here are aware, Buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. Once you go above a certain dose, it doesn't feel any stronger the more you take because it blocks itself due to the way it goes or stays in our receptors. I'm sure that this explaination overlooks something in brain chemistry. Such as how certain doses promotes the body to convert or produce ""norbuprenorphine"".


Not sure of the signifigance of that very last part but I do *believe* it has something to do with endorphins.

&nbsp;


What I am sure of is that (assuming I'm not in WD from shorter acting opis) when I take more than 4mg of Suboxone I feel a little nauseous. That sometimes when I take a 2mg I get strongly energetic and it lasts all day. I feel a kind like it came on faster and stronger than when I take more than 3mg in general. Not 100% sure but based partly on this, I don't think I want to take more than 1/4 of a Zub in the future. 


&nbsp;

A critical part of today's test is not to re-dose on the zub or regular subs. Simply ride it out. My hypothesis is that I'll feel fine at work for my whole shift all the way up until bed time. I suspect that the zub chemistry will contribute to a good night's sleep. That it won't run out of steam early, it might not have ""legs"" in a few hours but all will be well and energy levels will be normal.


I do feel someting right now... I gotta keep an eye on this sensation, see if I feel this way next time I take a normal sub of the same dosage.

&nbsp;


Best case, as I said the day goes by and I get a good night's sleep.



Worst case, it doesn't last the whole day and I somehow get really yawny. Unlikely for a multitude of reasons, at least it wouldn't be due to any form of WD. 


&nbsp;

Hopes. I hope that the stronger sensation I'm feeling doesn't result in some unplanned after effects or symptoms. Like a withdrawal. I also feel compelled to research what the deal is with Zubsolv. It is necessary for me to find out everything possible as I am worried that this formulation could derail my taper plan. I must know more in order to ensure I'm doing everything possible to avoid more discomfort than is necessary if and when I continue to taper lower.",1532198457.0

Nearly OD'd and quit, thought I'd learned my lesson. Around my birthday last month I got hit with a wave of depression and linked back up with the dealer. Have been slipping and sliding off and on now for several weeks until this past Monday. 

It was a day to day struggle this past week keeping the thoughts out, simultaneously telling myself this is a road to nowhere good one minute, then rationalizing the next. I'd stayed good this whole week, but I had left the door ajar by not deleting the dealer's contact from my phone. He calls this morning and my heart sinks as I see his number. I literally answer without any plan or thought in place of how I was going to handle it. He asked me ""what was up?"". This may sound really cliche but it almost felt like a moment suspended in time. I was stopped dead in my tracks, torn between avoiding a lonely boring Saturday with an easy short term fix, and doing what I knew needed to be done. To my now shock, I just started talking and said ""yeah man, I just need to quit, it's not good for me. Nothing personal. Take care and don't expect to hear from me again"". He said he understood and hung up. I stood in shock for a moment of what I'd actually just done. Then before any good could be undone or I could leave myself an easy out, I systematically erased any way for me to contact him, or him to contact me from my phone. (I know technically he could one day call me from a new number, but it was the best I could do and I told him he wouldn't hear from me again, so I think he will hopefully respect that and not contact me from different numbers down the road).

So I share this not hiding the fact that it feels good to revel in a personal victory, but also hopefully as encouragement to others out there struggling. Of course it's not a battle that is won in 30 seconds, but you do have it in you to make massive decisions that can alter your life within you. Much love, fam. ",1532197461.0

Can I shoot them, and if so, is there some special prep needed, or do I just crush them, mix with water and stir? Or should I try snorting? There is nothing else in the pills, no acetamenophin or anything like that, just straight hydromorphone. My other question is how much should I take? For comparison, I've been trying like hell to keep my tolerance down, so I've been doing between .06 and .1 grams of H. .06 to stay well, .1 to get off with a decent nod. How much hydro would be comparable to that? I shoot my dope.

Really scared.,"What’s up r/opiates? I have been out of rehab (for the 11th time) since November of last year. I was on Drug Court when I first got home and only by the grace of God got off of it and received non-adjudication probation. 

The first thing I did when I knew I didn’t have drug tests was get some Suboxone filled from my left over prescription. Sweet RELIEF. I knew that I had sold my sole, because I didn’t have the money to stay on. 

I paid my doctor visits and paid for everything else, allegedly, by selling drugs. Mainly Suboxone. 

Fast forward to now after going back and forth between 2 doctors I’m virtually out of Suboxone and I don’t know what to do. 

Opiates are the only drug that I ever was highly addicted to. I’ve been clean off Heroin over a year and all other opiates 11 months. I have used other drugs within this time frame, but no opiates other than Sub.

My question: What the hell am I going to do about the cravings without Suboxone and knowing that I have nothing blocking my receptors?

I have school aid coming (cash) and I started taking my psych meds again. I’m just out of it and hope I don’t relapse. 

From somebody who has been on and off Suboxone/Subutex since I was 18. If you are considering Suboxone. It has BAD side effects.

- COMPLETE loss of sex drive, erectile dysfunction, inorgasmia and it’s super hard to pee. Your dick is basically useless.
- Sweating like a French hooker. Perspiration.
- Complete lack of interest in hobbies, money, girls, music and friends
- Fatigue and tiredness. 
- Loss of appetite

Suboxone doesn’t give you any buzz and makes your dick completely stop working JUST so you won’t crave opiates. Sacrificing your dick because you don’t have will power.

Honestly after reading over those side effects I’m glad I’m turning a new page in my life. I’m going to get some Kratom and Benzos and just tough it out I guess guys. Wish me luck.",1532181590.0

I ran out of H last night which left me sick as a dog today. Not only had I gone through withdrawal, was lucky to get a pretty easy one this time, but I had to work on my birthday all day sick as fuck.

We get up and see (C) laying on the hardwood floor in the kitchen but his head was blocked by the door way into the kitchen so we could only see his legs/feet. We sprung into fucking action and when we got to him his face was gray and turning slightly blue. My buddy (A) immediately began doing CPR on (C). After about a minute of CPR his color was returning to him and he let out a gasp that I will never forget.we get him stood up and are just giving him simple commands like ""keep moving"" and I kept yelling into his ear to take a deep breath.

When I was a freshman in highschool they gave me unlimited 10mg hydrocodone's for the pain, but I didn't like taking them and stopped after a while.

A decade later and good luck getting any painkillers. I see a physical therapist twice a week, a chiropractor once every other week, massage therapy, etc. Which overall helps a TON, but I still get breakthrough pain that gets so intense that I'll sometimes black out when walking home (anyone else ever have this?). I went to a doctor several times and was told I'm too young to have back problems so no MRI for me, and I get 20 Flexeril a YEAR.

Well that obviously isn't going to cut it when twice a week I have to spend the evening laying flat out the ground to help the pain, and eventually the back pain turns into a migraine and I'm pretty much done for the day. I'm in my fucking 20s and planning a wedding while lying on the ground in pain regularly, and this is how I am supposed to survive??? When I'm about to marry the love of my life, and all I can think about is how I just want it all to end. I just want to be able to live a life worth living.

So no doctor will even take me seriously or prescribe anything (especially after mentioning that CBD lotion helps me a TON, and I'm in a legal state). Ok, well I'm not ready to give up on life, so I've been trying every muscle relaxer and opiate and NMDA antagonist under the sun to help bring me some temporary peace. MXE was a godsend, but that's gone now.

Of course all this shit is illegal and expensive, so now half my paycheck goes to buying packs of 20mg Roxicodone that I sometimes take at night to function. I regularly volunteer at a needle exchange and standing for hours really hurts my midback, so the other night I had to take 60mg over the evening just to be able to sit on the couch and plan my own wedding. That's almost $100 in pills, depending on your source, just for an evening of feeling ""alright"". Are you fucking kidding me?

I've never used heroin or injected anything, nor am I trying to cure opiate withdrawals. This is just how my body is. These are the cards I was dealt. And America's solution? Go buy pills from your local neighborhood drug dealer and hope it isn't fent! But the price is insane! Oh, but heroin is cheaper... Maybe I could just switch to that and be responsible like everyone else thought they could? 

It's fucking ridiculous, and I know I'm preaching to the choir but it seems no one else has a fucking ear to listen anymore. All I want to do is live my life without being immobilized. I just want something to look forward to besides the end. I want to love and live, without squinting in agony.

Edit: I do use a Kratom tincture regularly and it does help immensely for the constant dull achy pain. Getting an MRI is my next step, but I know that I can't get anything from pain management because I'll test dirty on the UA because I use CBD/thc regularly for pain. 

A while ago I sent my mom, who has horrible neuropathic pain, some medicated lotion and it helped her Sooo much, but then she popped dirty on her urine test and got a strike. So now she can't use it again and is back to opiates.",1532132114.0

2: Once addicted, did you feel high at all, or did you just feel normal and no longer sick?  

3: What does getting high from an injection feel like (the come-up) versus snorting, smoking?  

4: How often would you have to snort it, inject or smoke it in order to not get sick? Is five-six hours correct?  

5: If you happen to be a rather skinny, five feet tall woman, how much would you use per dose, you think?  

6: What does heroin feel like to you? How did it interact with your personality, memories, feelings, etc.?  

7: Was the first time you used heroin different than all the other times?  

8: After the first time, was it very hard to resist taking more?

I sure do feel like a piece of shit,"My childhood boyfriend (who I lost my virginity to) was the one to introduce me to dope when I was withdrawing after my scripts were no longer needed. We stayed close throughout the 16 years we’ve known each other. His addiction has been pretty bad for a couple years now, and he’s turned into quite the scum to be honest.

March of 2017 I was using one of his connects for whatever reason. He came to pick up my $250 and I didn’t see or hear from him after that. Until last week when I ran into him and he acted like it was all fine and dandy. He didn’t even respond when I text him about it later that day. Alright then, I guess we’re just rug sweeping.

He asked me today to get him some dope. Yea no problem I’m getting my own. But then I thought, wait, he doesn’t even feel bad about still owing me. Does he think I’m too weak to take the money back? I text a couple friends who knew the situation and they both told me that I had every right to keep the money. So I did. I did leave him with what was in my dropper, a shot or 2 worth. He’s blocked, but I was gonna unblock him in a couple days to tell him we can just be even now and that I will actually help him next time. I know he still needs me because he’s clearly burned all his current bridges. Sorrry this is so long I just can’t help but feel guilty and I’m wondering if it was wrong to do that?

Without getting into toooo many details I generally base my decision on if I like a product based on taste, how “clean” or “clear” the trails are, how smooth Jt burns, and it’s effects... obviously. 

I’ve had some friends who shoot say they have really bomb stuff but when I try it and smoke it I find it to be not very good at all. 

Idk much about shooting but when you melt it down and suck it up through cotton or other filter is it possible that given most impurities are removed that if you’re shooting it you can’t really gauge how good the product is at least in terms for someone who smokes because your shot is essentially always going go be more or less pure heroin? 

I’m not sure if I’ve really articulated or explained my question very well or if I got any facts or info wrong about shooting or the process of shooting I apologize.

On a side note, for both smokers and shooters, how do you gauge the quality of your product? 

In my region black tar is what’s widely and almost only available which from my understanding black tar is inherently less pure due to the conversion process used. But i still seem to come across some quite pure stuff for what it is that gets the job done. 

Are other forms of heroin able to be reliably smoked? Ivd been told smoking China white is a waste and ineffective and the one time I tried to smoke it didn’t work out very well. 

All I know is there’s nothing that ruins my day more than spending my last bit of money on garbage black that burns like shit, taste like shit, hardly gets me well and gives me a headache. Drives me fucking crazy....

Hope everyone is getting your gear, not having long wait times, and generally having a good day and better day than I am. ",1532109978.0

Anyways I'm a grown ass man... and throughout all my partying, alcoholism, benzo fueled, weed smoking, extasy popping, shroomie madness.
I've never had bowel issues. Let me clarify that by saying, yes the occasional bout of constipation with the opiates, and vice versa, with the drinking.

Fast forward 10 years, into full blown opiate addiction. I'm now 32 years old. I've cut out most if not all other drugs, mainly because it's hard enough paying for a full blown maintenance of opiates. And if I'm honest, I really could care less about all the other stuff now. Probably has to do with the brain and receptors gone to shit and rewired.

Anyway, back to the point... and I've got to blame this partly on the fent problem that's leaked into every crevice and corner of the dope and press pill market nowadays. And partly on my addiction and chronic pain from a really bad car accident when I was in highschool. But withdraws now, have become so debilitating that I can barely move because of my back and neck pain, and general will to want to die (not really, just the feeling). So to the point I'm trying to make (sorry I swear it's comming, couldn't stop it if I tried... literally lol)   I'd wager to bet, that in the past month alone, I've seriously shit my pants, about 4-5 times, as well as shit in my bedroom trashcan for lack of being able to make it more than 5 feet.(thank god its fairly large, and always always has a bag in it, with a backup nearby)  Oh yeah, and I've simultaneously power washed the entire face of the toilet tank/bowl, and projectile vomited into the tub, for lack of a better option. Which also puts me in this weird, contorted way of sitting... also murder on my back, especially while throwing up and involuntarily flexing every muscle in my back and chest.

So, moral of the story, this really really sucks. And it's most likely time for a change. And not just in my doc, in my sobriety.... but good lawrd it's gunna be hell.... ",1532072617.0

A bit of googling will tell you myrrh is meant to have some opiate properties so I decided to give it a go. 

It's not the first time I've tried it, in the past I've tried eating in and snorting it. The former method of ingestion did jack shit and latter did ziltch except for leaving me blowing sap out my nose for the next 12 hours. Still forums out there are insisting it works snorted because it can cross the mucus membrane in the nose or some shit. 

I need something so I'm willing to give it a go again. The last time didn't work, maybe because I couldn't get enough in, I needed a way to consume more. Then I had a bright idea, my nose isn't the only membrane drugs can pass through. So I grabbed a 5ml syringe and my mortar and pestle and crushed up a bunch of myrrh to a fine powder and mixed it with water. I asked my partner to give me a minute of privacy, lubed up the syringe and booty bumped that sweet Jesus sap. I did it twice 'cause I wanted to give it a proper go. Well it didn't do anything more than it had snorted or eaten. At least I have a holy shit to look forward to.

TL;DR Myrrh is about as effective as an opiate as cheese is.

EDIT: I should mention I also attempted smoking it which felt exactly like you'd imagine smoking tree sap does. Maybe I'll try vaping crack pipe style.",1532064694.0

I have a fairly heavy oxy habit of roughly 90-150mg/day and I haven’t done heroin in at least 4 years. Last week I picked up 1/2g (ecp) cuz my guy was all outta blues and wouldnt be getting anymore for awhile so if figured I would make life difficult for myself and start sniffing dope again. The shit only gets me high for about 30 mins then wears off, I don’t start feeling sick or anything it just has no legs. The obvious answer is that it’s got a bunch of fent in it which doesn’t surprise me. Seeing as how 90mg of oxy throughout the day keeps me fairly high. I was really surprised that this H wasn’t really doing the trick. It’s got a great rush and makes me feel really euphoric but it wears off really quick. I’m doing WAY more than I feel like I should need to be doing, pretty much blowing half a gram a day if not a little more. 

Is this just par for the course here?? I would think a moderate oxy abuser would be getting high for way longer than 30mins a time off half a G a day, or am I being too optimistic? It has no vinegar smell to it at all really and almost tastes sweet. I don’t really catch a vicious nod off it unless I blow a lot (don’t want to either, that scares me) but I’m having to go blow lines way more often than I thought I would.

Am I just getting shitty dope? Like
I said it’s been YEARS since I’ve sniffed heroin so I was really thinking o was gonna feel ripped all day off a few points but I’m finding myself sneaking off to the bathroom at work multiple times a day and taking bumps/lines all night long before I go to bed.

Lope and kratom keep most of the symptoms at bay, aside from the occasional sweats or chills and tightness in the legs (any of these symptoms last ~20 min max at a time), but the worst of wd for me is probably 90% mental. Even without the kratom, I get nothing like most of you talk about. (NEEEEEED the immodium though!!)

I've seen people cry about wd after a week bender, and I get that everyone's body is different, but Ive been going pretty steady for 2 years doing 120-180mg oxy/day with 10-60 days on, followed by 3-7 days off.  I was sober for about 3 yrs prior to starting again in '16, and even with my previous habit of 80mg opana/day (god I miss those things), I don't recall any horrible wd from that go around either. Even weeklong binges of ecp when I couldn't get my stop signs(never longer than that, that I remember) would leave me feeling ""fine"" in the days following. 

My last re-up after a 3 day break was 150 30s on 6/17, ran out this past monday, and I've slept like a baby every night, worked 10 hour days doing a highly demanding/ high stress job (I manage a $50M/yr inside sales office), and feel physically fine aside from mild depression and intense cravings. 

Maybe it's because I'm a closet user and CANT show signs of being sick at work or at home? Because I stay busy all day? Maybe I'm still considered a chipper since I have up to week long breaks every few months and it'll eventually catch up to me? I would have surely thought it would have happened by now, though. 

I almost never get more when I'm at the ""worst"" of my wd, so maybe my body/brain doesn't connect the blues with making me feel better?

Anyone else this lucky?

(And before anyone says it's because I'm doing presses lol, I assure you they come straight from the pharm and I've been in the game long enough to know even when they don't come from my normal CVS pickup)

I've known about this sub for months. I wish I'd posted before the media caught wind of it. :-(

im a disabled single parent (if I described my specific physical condition, I'd be easily recognizable to anyone who knows me irl bc I have a relatively unique collection of stuff going on, so I won't go into detail) chronic pain patient. I've been on opioids for over a year now. of course, the inevitable has happened. my body has built up a hell of a tolerance. its so hard. I'm barely surviving in any sense of the word, financially (not like I can work, no child support), emotionally, physically. ill be in pain until the day I die and it feels like it's become impossible to get any real relief.  

I just would like someone or a couple people to talk to and maybe get advice from, who understand my situation. you don't necessarily have to be a chronic pain patient or sufferer yourself but I wouldn't be surprised to find that there are a fair few of us here. normies dont realize how soul sucking it is. its like trying to lead a normal life while being actively crushed under the wheels of a semi. but that doesn't need to be your specific experience. 

if you're recovery oriented, you might be better off not contacting me. I dont wanna be a trigger or anything but I'm not recovery focused. my need for a quality of life means that recovery is not ever in the cards for me. I don't wanna be made to feel crappy for that, either. its just how it is.

It started out and she was actively using. I figured it out right away. By then I had feelings for her and tried to be there for her and encourage her to quit. Its been a roller coaster. I heard a lot of lies and learned alot about what addicts are capable of. 

I guess my patience paid off and she has been clean for several months now. 

It has been great.  Really great. 

I'm still kind of haunted by the idea that this sobriety will be fleeting. She's used opiates for the better part of a decade. In that time, she's been clean before but it didn't last. 

Although she's lied while using she's open about things now. It's scary to have learned how much of an addict she really was.  It's shocking to me as someone who never had a problem like this how much the need for opiates makes a good person do bad things.  She's lied, manipulated, and took advantage of many people to feed her habit. At the same time, she was the victim of at least one  really bad person. 

Also shocking to learn that in addition to being an opiate addict she's heavily used coke, crack, and meth, but for shorter periods. While with me I recently learned that she was hooked on Xanax too.  What is really surprising is that she never switched to heroin even though she would go through $300 of oxy in a night. She has a high tolerance for withdrawals I guess. 

I don't really know what I'm asking here. 

I'm so invested in her and I'm afraid that all of her progress can be destroyed by one bad decision. I have alot of anxiety over it.  

For her part she says now is different. She doesnt think about using. She's happy. 

I believe it but still sometimes feel like I'm waiting for that relapse. 

What do you guys think?  Is there anything I should be doing?  I know people do stay clean and I know relapses are common. It's hard for me to find peace with all of this uncertainty. 

Your thoughts as opiates users are appreciated.",1532030807.0

Nobody fucking cares that you don't do street drugs, you still live chained to a bottle. Nobody cares about your pain, nobody cares about you

Back then it was really easy for me to use opiates and stop but it became increasingly difficult for me to stop using the more I used. I live on the west side of the USA and down here there’s pills percs,vicodin, black tar heroin and fake blues which are basically fake mboxes with fent in them. I would use whatever I could get my hands on. One day I had no money, or any way to get money, I’d already borrowed or sold whatever was left of value I had so I pretty much stayed home sick as a dog all day until a friend reached out and said he had 4 suboxone strips he could let me have. I’d tried subs before but they caused a horrible precipitated withdrawal so I was weary but I accepted. This time I took my first strip over 12 hours since my last shot so the suboxone provided relief and kept me well, well into the next day. That what’s when I decided it was time to clean up. I’d tried quitting many times before but never got too far. I halved my dose every day from 8mg to 4 mg to 2 mg and so on until I was able to stay well for almost an entire day with only .25 mg of suboxone. This process was surprisingly easy and painless after that I decided to jump off the subs. I found it a little hard to sleep but nothing too bad I went for a long walk then took Advil PM and was able to pass out. My difficulty sleeping kept me up some nights but I was proud of myself for being clean after many years of abuse I finally felt what being sober was like again and it kept me going. Fast forward to today I’ve got my own place, a good job, a good amount of money in the bank, better mental health and most importantly peace within myself. I look back at myself when I was using and I wouldn’t go back to that ever. My mind was just in a terrible place suicide had crossed my thoughts almost every day. I’m just glad I didn’t kill myself or else I wouldn’t be here, a happier me. Looking back quitting wasn’t really that painful with the help of the subs. I think it’s possible to quit only when you are truly fed up and tired of all the bad stuff using brings to your life. If I can get a message across to anyone trying to quit opiates it is that the hardest part of quitting is getting over the fear of the sickness which isn’t too bad at all if you taper with subs and have the right motivation. Once I was clean for a few days I started to see the world differently, many things I took for granted such as family and relationships became important. I think life is way better now that I’m not spending day in and day out using or figuring out how I was going to get money for dope. I feel like had I not decided to make a change I wouldn’t be here but here I am happy as can be.",1531993069.0

I've started to break up my pattern of once a week, then i thought ""no problem i'll just go back to once a week again"". 

I'm using codeine, which i'm lucky was enough to satiate the depression and boredom i had before opiates. Though my doses went up to 1500mg as of recently (don't get high from 500mg anymore) and started taking 2-3 times a week. Just decided to go back and the cravings/mid physical withdrawals i'm having are awful. Just figured, as i'm extracting my current codeine from the pills i bought that i've become addicted to it, and can't function properly without it.

So, when did you realise you've become addicted? When was the first time you had full blown withdawals? Share your stories for those who dabble in opiates, like me, who think they've got it and all the warnings don't apply to them",1531996058.0

Im currently waiting on my middle who picked up my cash at 11:30 this morning and still yet to return but says he will still come straight to me after picked up.  Ive known this middle for a few months and hes been either really reliable and comes thru quick to taking holy fuck forever.

My middle that ive come to be cool with and even friends is my main plug atm.  He delivers which is cool bc i have no ride to get to pickup so hes been cool by picking up and dropping off for me.  Ive got a few other plugs but to get anything i gotta go to them and as much as i rather do that than go thru my middle (as youll find out more as i explain later) i can only get rides only so often.

The great thing as ive said before about my dude who delivers is just that....he delivers!  But problem is is that he uses....hes got no place to stay and no job....and throughout the short period of time knowing him hes made up a bunch of excuses for his delays which sometimes take an excess of half a day if he even returns with my goods to sometimes multiple days bc of said excuses.

He basically hussles all day stealin or pullin schemes or just plain ol committing crime to support his habit.  Or he pulls a bunch of cash together and buys a bunch of our DOC tar to get his and then delivers to each person what they ordered leaving him with a pretty solid come up and he didn't even have to pay for it its pretty sick what he does.  But it does take some scheming to make it all happen and coordinate it all so i guess its cool he gets his shit for making it happen for all his people that want some.

But i swear ive never heard of a person either running out of gas so many times causing delays or even getting arrested multiple times in a month with crazy reasons for getting picked up and i would think would be jail time but somehow is on the streets again the next day.  Now i obviously know whats up like he either used my shit and needs to find a way to get more and says those reasons is why he cant make it to me. 

It sucks that sometimes i gotta wait awhile and i give him my cash to go and get and if something does go down where he doesnt make it to me for hours or days on a few occasions he has always made it right and sometimes even giving me more like an extra half or more bc he feels bad.

Thats chill but i cant help but get irritated when he lags.  I know thats just the way it is and im super lucky he eveb delivers and things have gone somewhat decently ok in the short amount of time knowing him and also that i have received what ive expected majority of the time....of course there has been times when ive gotten less or half now half later cuz of whatever shit happens.  Bottomline is i wish a had a fucken car lol cuz then i wouldnt have to wait on my homeless addict middle.

Again..knock on wood ive been lucky  and im super duper appreciative to not have homeboy walk off with my cash which ranges from hundreds of dollars to 40 for a half depending on what im grabbing but cant help but feel uneasy about it when something that takes maybe a few hours takes all day all night and then there might be some other shit that goes down causing me to get shorted.

It just the principal of the matter which in the dope game your fortunate to deal with people that got any principals cuz ive been burned and  when you give away the last of you dough and hope for getting your shit and it doesnt go down its def a horrible feeling especially when your sick and hoping and praying that your middle shows up and sends that best feeling in the world text ""here"".  Lol cant tell you how awesome that feels to get that message pop up.

Tldr: main plug is a homeless addict who middles for me cuz i dont got a car and takes forever when he goes to pick up with the cash i give him.",1531985541.0

Ok so I had just went over to my buddies house and grabbed a couple of ounces of weed. I sell a little on the side for some extra cash and what not. Anyway i went and grabbed that and put the bud in a jar so it keeps the smell from coming out because bags are the worst at that.

I get the good as usual no problems and start to drive home. As I'm driving home I kinda notice a lot of cops and I felt as if one was following me from leaving my buddy's place because he was behind me a ways back in the second street I turned on after leaving his place. So I lose sight of him as I went down a hill and turned to avoid him then made another turn. I lost his forsure. Wasn't even sure if he was following me but I was close to my place already so didn't want to take any chances.

Anyway I drive to my next street and take a left. Guess who's right behind me? A different cop. So I'm driving normally not speeding. Stop fully at a stop sign and proceed. Now the streets are kinda not lined up at this intersection so I ended up barley going into the bike lane like ever so slightly. I keep driving and sure as shit the cop lights me up. I'm like fuckkkkkkkk.

Now keep in mind I'm on probation and not to mention my liscence is suspended. (I'm a dumbass I know i don't wanna hear it rn) so he comes up to the car asks for the usual I let him know it's suspended. He then asks me when's the last time I smoked weed in the car. I never smoke in my car so I knew the bud must have smelled. So I Tell him never he said he can smell it. I deny. He then says man just be honest with us so we can get you going on your way. I tell him I've got a couple of ounces behind me. Asks me to step out all that good stuff.

They ask me all about where I got it who I got it from if I'm selling because I had like 2 baggies. I try to cover up for my buddy but they end up taking my phone and looking through it. (they can do this cuz I'm on probation) they see I texted my plug recently and his full name in my address book. And then they ask me how long I've known him. I say a few days I just met him. Ask me where he lives again and I said I don't know the address so they go well you must have used GPS then right? Which I did. And they check my GPS his address is right there.

I just agreed with them and shit. So then I go back to my car thinking I'm fucked I'm getting arrested and violating my probation. I even am moving back to Colorado in like 2 weeks transferring my probation so that was fucked too if I get arrested or a ticket. So they have me sign some shit and tell me they're cutting me a huge break right now and I knew they were. Only wrote me up for suspension and bike lane. No possession charge. I was amazed. I could be in jail right now. They even let me drive away without a liscence.

I'm pretty sure it's because of the evidence they got against my plug they let me off like that. I call my dude right away and tell him so he can prepare.

I'm tired of lying to my girlfriend and my family. I'm tired of running from the sickness. Tired of my middle man fucking me over and making me wait for hours and hours even though his dude told him I can have his number, but middle man won't give it to me.

I'm tired of selling my possessions to get right. I'm tired of walking the streets in the dead of night to take my mind off my aching body and restless legs. I'm tired of waking up and wondering how I'm gonna fund my habit for the day. I'm tired of fucking up my veins and leaving welts up and down my arms. I'm tired of my escalating tolerance and my monstrous habit.

I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of asking my friends to please front me a point until I get paid or sell enough weed to pay them back. Worst of all, I'm tired of living. I just want to get through this, but I'm terrified of the sickness. I'm in a bad place, and I'm tired of digging myself out of the hole I've dug just to toss my aching, broken body back in, two feet deeper each time.

He told me the first day was ""amazing"" because of how little he felt and because in general, he just felt nice. Two days later, he's getting headaches, nausea, and extreme appetite repression. He feels too weak to walk. Ive fucked around with oxy (30-40) a few times, and after a specific binge i remember feeling a little similar to him.

So here are my questions:

Is withdrawl possible just from surgery anaesthetic/pain killing? (he never got prescribed any for home, so it would all be administered at the hospital which he left a few hrs after surgery) For context, he's around 4'7-4'11"" and obciously have 0 tolerance.

Is it possible for someone small and inexperienced enough to be experiencing these kind of withdrawl symptoms just from those doses? I'm just worried about him, he's like family to me and im the only person around him whos thought about this.

Am i crazy, or should this be brought up to the doctor?

But i made it there and back in about 30 minutes. I wanted to die by the time i got back, i forgot to bring a bottle of water with me.

So I'm going to a show tomorrow that starts at 7pm. I've being doing some research but I want to make sure I'm careful. So I take a 1mg Clonazepam everyday in the morning 8/9am. It's the main thing I'm worried about at the moment. I'm thinking of doing this for tomorrow:

1mg Clonazepam @ 8AM 500mg Phenibut @ 1PM 150 (or 300mg?) Lyrica @ 5ish PM or at the door @ 6PM (Probably just the 150 though)

Show should go till 11PM, and the main thing I'm worried about since I'm doing phenibut for the first time is it not actually working the way I'm hoping and dealing with anxiety stopping me from going through with the show. (Going alone, and not crazy on concerts by yourself).

If things aren't looking 100% by 5ish, would I be ok taking another 1mg (or .5mg) Clonazepam to steady my nerves? (Or keep it handy for later that night, or is that going to end badly?)

When im going out for fun, I usually do 150mg pregabalin + 150 an hour or two later (or 300/150), and then 10mg hydrocodone or 10mg oxycodone and 1mg Clonazepam mixed in, but opiates usually dull music for me, which is why I want to try this instead. (Since I hear music is amazing on phenibut). 

All in all, what do y'all think? Dose wise, time wise, etc. Or stick to my usual routine?

P.S Should I forgo the Lyrica and just take 1g of phenibut around 1PM? (Or 500mg @ 1PM and another 500mg @ 3/4 PM?)",1531964792.0

What are the options for pain after quitting?  
  
I was a user for 5+ years. Started off with the speckled Vicodins, then led to hydrocodone/oxycodone/oxymorphone/hydromorphone, pharmaceutical fentanyl, and Heroin. My last stint was a 6 month binge of Tar at 3g/daily and finally quitting with the use of Suboxone. Due to my abuse, I find it very difficult to cope with my pain even after being clean for a while now (3+ months, maybe. I don't try to keep up). I've been researching options and it doesn't seem like there is much out there (gabapentin, nsaids, cyclobenzaprine, soma etc don't help).  
  
I'm currently considering yet still reluctant on using benzodiazipines for relief instead of marijuana (legally). My last encounter with the devil's lettuce resulted in an anxiety/panic attack (this was when you either got ""stress"" or ""chronic""). My last option is a cortisone shot, which I'm not familiar with at all.

So was snooping through CL for “blue roxy jeans” then I see a post for “blue buttons”. In the post theres some random shit and the numbers “30”. So I email the poster a week ago and get nothing back until today after emailing a few question marks. They hit my line and ask if I’m still interested. Me thinking Ive finally found a plug in my own city I reply “absolutely!” And that im at work but I get off at 6 and have a 45 min - hour drive home. Me being cautious, im anxious to see how they react.. I feel like sometimes the sketchy ones will get all butthurt or try to move things way to fast.
They reply “no problem, just hit me up” 
I also pay attention to how they text.. pretty good indication of how old they are or how sketchy. Meaning do they “tALk lik dIs” or “like this” 
Do they have a signature attached? 
They had very good punctuation and replied quickly but not so fast that it made me feel uncomfortable. I get home early around 4:30 as to catch them off guard and say “I’m back in town, you wanna meetup.” That way theres not too much time to plan anything I feel like. I meet HER at a jack in the box not to far from my place (pretty nice upscale area) and low and behold its a girl!!

After all her antics from the day before, I reluctantly split it with her. Gabriella didn’t deserve it, but she was beautiful. She was my girl. She would also make my life a living hell if I didn’t share.

Even though the amount was miniscule, it was enough. I could feel it. She couldn’t though and was very vocal about how insufficient it was for her and how much of a waste it was for her to even poke herself. She never thought about the things she said to me. It seemed like she was completely unaware of how selfish she was. She had just begged me for what I gave her and wouldn’t even say thank you. You know, it’s not like I expected a thank you, but she could have just left out the part where she was super unthankful and disappointed.

“I thought you said you had a good one. What the hell was that?”

“I did.”

“What happened to it? It hit like dirt water for me.”

“Yeah? Maybe it’s because you made me give you half.”

“Whatever. What are you gonna do for us now?”

“You’ll see.” I smiled. This was my chance. As often and as terribly as she disrespected me and made me feel so insecure about my manhood, her seeing me running around strong arming and robbing and stealing and fighting for her would win her over. Her opinions would change. She would respect me. “Let’s go to Home Depot.”

We got into her green Ford Focus and drove until we parked across the freeway in a different neighborhood. Then, I gave her the plans about how it would go. She wouldn’t get in trouble, no matter what. If they were chasing me and I couldn’t get a clean break from them to get into her car, I would take the fall. I told her that before I left. She was playing Candy Crush on her phone. She didn’t seem impressed.

I put a gym bag I brought from the house under my thick hoodie and ran across the freeway. When I popped up off the grass embankment, I stood at the back of a small Chinese buffet that wasn’t open yet. My heart thumped in my chest. My breaths got shallow. Excitement pulsed through my veins and the freedom to be myself again made the walk to the front door and to the power tool aisle seem like only a half second had passed since I got out of the car. I opened the bag up and put it on the floor, filling it with the best brands of heavy duty impact drills, zipping it up and throwing it over my shoulder as I walked out.

A linebacker of a man met me about ten feet onto the pavement and asked,

“How you doing buddy? You wanna put my merchandise down and come with me?”

I dropped the bag, but I wasn’t going with him. He was tall, so my feet had to come off the ground before my knuckles could contact his jaw. The man stiffened. He fell straight back. His head hit hard with a thump that made everyone look our way. I picked up the bag and ran.

As I got to the freeway, a small black man was behind me recording me on his phone from the back of the Chinese restaurant. I was distracted by that and stepped out into the freeway without looking very well. Besides, my adrenaline was running hard. A car was about to take my life, and all I could do was put my hands over my face. Somehow, though, it missed me and crashed into the car next to it, which crashed into the concrete barriers dividing the interstate. After those cars, a Landrover almost creamed me too but swerved and flipped onto its side and top. The other lanes of traffic were less eventful, and I never looked back to see if anyone was hurt. I just made the getaway.

Up a few blocks and around a corner sitting in the driver seat was Gabriella.  I ran up to the passenger side and banged on the window with my chest heaving and the bag in my hands. She would barely look up from playing Candy Crush and tried to unlock the door from her side. It didn’t work. My door remained locked. After a minute of me frantically knocking and trying to open it and screaming that we had to hurry, she slowly reached over to open my door manually. I opened the back door and slid the heavy gym bag in the back seat before jumping in the front.

“I’m not feeling good. I need some dope.”

“What do you think this is?” I reached back and stroked the bag of loot, like a proud Viking after a successful pillage. Here was my worth. She would see it now.

“It’s definitely not dope. And what in the hell are we going to do with that anyway, Clyde? Huh?”

“Babe, we’ve got the next best thing.”

“Money’s the next best thing. You’re telling me that bag is full of money?”

“We’ll have money soon.”

I had her drive us back to the house and used her phone to take pictures and put the drills on Craig’s List. The first one sold for 80 bucks. We made plans to meet the buyer in the McDonald’s parking lot, and when he showed up, it turned out to be a guy we both knew from the Friday evening NA meeting we went to sometimes. His name was Vic and told me he’d buy the rest of them from me for 200 dollars in the morning and give me a good day of work, if I wanted it. I told him I did. He’d be by to pick me up the next morning.

As I walked back to the car, I rubbed the four 20-dollar bills between my thumb and forefinger in my pocket. Gabriella broke her neck from the driver’s seat to watch the transaction. Things were good. Now, all we had to do was call her guy and drive to the trap. When I got into the car, she asked me,

“Why don’t you f\*ck me anymore, Clyde? Huh?”

“Why don’t I………” I thought about it. There were lots of reasons. Bi weekly psychotic breaks. Her violent episodes. Her severe depression. Antagonizing questions and statements like the one she’d just made.

“You like boys or something?”

“C’mon Gabriella. Knock it off. We got money. Let’s go get some dope. You’re being ridiculous.”

She called her guy. His name was Leeroy. We rode in silence, because for some reason, I was getting the silent treatment from her. At the trap, she said I couldn’t come in and then she took an hour to come back out. She was sweaty. Her hair was messy, and the collar of her shirt hung open like it’d been pulled and stretched by someone inside. I didn’t even bother trying to find out what took so long. I had a pretty good idea, but she seemed to be in a better mood, until I asked how much she got for the 80 bucks. Then, she showed me two small tinfoil bindles. It was a rip off. Before I could level a case about how badly she’d screwed me over again after all I had done for her that day, she started bawling. Her mascara ran. She couldn’t believe I was disappointed with her about what she got.

“I’m just giving you what he gave me.”

“Whatever. Let’s go home.”",1531950881.0

Typically we are splitting about a gram of China a day.  This past week we have been trying to taper down due to the fact she has to be clean for a UA for probation in just under two weeks.  Tapering using dope has been really difficult so our habit hasn't really gotten much better this past week.  She has a prescription for Oxycodone and we have been trying to stock up on those to get through the days prior to her UA but even a 20mg dose doesn't seem to help the bad withdrawals so we have still been using dope...  I have read that heroin can build up in your fat cells after heavy use and might be detectable for longer than the 2-4 days most online sources say.  

So my question is if anyone has experience with heroin being detectable for longer than 6 or 7 days on a UA?  We are hoping to get one more bag and only do little tiny bits when the withdrawals get too unbearable this weekend.   

Her probation officer does have on file that she has been prescribed codeine in the past and I am hoping in the worst case scenario, if she comes up hot for opiates other than oxy, that we say she took a codeine from an old script...

I prefer books over movies because i like to interpret the books in my own mind rather than what somebody else has for the movie. 

Anyway this is kind of off topic and feel free to remove this post but i know some of you on here read, and would love some good suggestions on some books to read. I like criminal books and obviously drug related books. I realize some books that i plan on reading will be triggers but if you read my getting sober post I'm determined to get sober not only for myself but my family/future family.   


So, one book i have seen mentioned on here is **Drugstore Cowboy,** I plan on reading the book first before watching the movie to see which one i like better. (probably the book since thats always the case most times)  


If anyone has any suggestions on their favourite books i would appreciate it very much! It doesn't have to meet my criteria I'm open to literally anything as long as its interesting. Thanks guys",1531921060.0

I got a lil problem and i need some professional advice :

2016 i robbed a junkie. I know, im a pos. I was desparate and needed the pills to keep up facade to my then gf. So I stuck him up w a knife.

Today, omw from the mmt ambulance, he ID'ed me. Threatened me w 2 others but didnt do shit as they were in public. Id pay em back if I wasnt sure that he doesnt just want the money but retribution. 

I already called the facility, ill head in 2h earlier than shop opens and ill hopefully be transmitted to another location here in the same city. Anyways, ill be moving outta this shithole til august anyways. 

My plan was to lay low, stay away frm the streets and esp the scene they found me at stupidly. I was an idiot and had my guard down cuz we seen each other couple of times and it never clicked for him. Well fuck me .
On the 1st ill be gone plus ill be in berlin (where im going) this weekend anyways. When I return Ill just go in early for that week; go to the other center and gtfo asap.

Oh and ill have to carry protection now. Fml. I hate it here and this is jus the cherry on top. Fuck this place man",1531914515.0

It seems to be all americans (which is no problem of course) but the opiate culture is very different over here. We have codeine, tramadol, morphine, smack (heroin but the brown stuff you have to either smoke or inject), suboxone/methadone and fentanyl, but none of all the prescription pills you have in the US like oxys and hydros. Something that confuses me about the US is you seem to use opiates and benzos as party drugs, like lean and xanax, which makes no sense to me at all because those just aren’t party drugs here - we go for MDMA ketamine and cocaine, and personally I like speed as well but it’s not that popular where I live. Another thing is everyone hates smackheads and smack dealers in the part of the UK where I live (Isle of Man). There’s even a group of beak dealers in Manchester that go around at night just beating the shit out of heroin addicts, I think there was a vice documentary about it. Another HUUUGE difference is slang, obviously there’s going to be different slang in the US as there is in the UK but it’s the style of language that’s completely different, it’s hard to explain. Are there any other people from the uk that feel a little excluded sometimes because of the massive differences in drug culture?",1531908344.0

Things slowly have gotten worse and over the years I went from codeine to oxycodone. Now days I spend my life picking up my scripts , using it in a week. Then getting the worst depression and spending a couple weeks with night sweats, diarrhoea and all other horrible symptoms (During this time I'll try to get high on anything, like pregabalin and shit) . Life fucking sucks, I don't even enjoy oxy and benzos anymore. It's just a weeks holiday every month from my problems. 

I'm in my twenties and this is what my adult life has been. I've stopped functioning at this point , don't work or see friends anymore. Now I know what the buzz is from opiates , feeling 'normal' absolutely sucks dick. I just can't seem to break the cycle, I always end up back at square one. The only time I feel happy and excited is when I'm picking up my next script. Last month was good, I spent my food money seeing a private doctor so I could have a double oxy script . 2 weeks going hungry is nothing new for me , I haven't eaten much in years.

I don't know how to stop, I don't want to stop . But I need to stop. I tried ending my life earlier this year because of withdrawals but was found and rushed to hospital. 

I used to be a nice, outgoing , caring guy . This fucking addiction has made me a manipulative, selfish recluse. 

Damn I miss what it was like when contentedness didn't come in pill form.

I want to hear your guys stories of how you ended up where you are?",1531904342.0

Gonna get one with a glass bottom. Do you think il lose good amounts of the blue to static and shit? I think a snuff bullet covered by a tissue would be more discreet in the backseat than any other method, even the crush in straw trick.  Probably gonna bring like 15 blues on this 3 day trip. Gonna crush like 4 and put them in separate vials for the 3 hour trip. I tend to do extra shit when i relapse like crush 3 blues in a tiny bit of water and throw it back.
