When I say a weekend it’s either 1 day or 2 days then I’m T total. Never used any more often. So I’m after some opinions. 

Is there a better opiate to sleep on? Whenever I take heroin I nod out and have crazy vivid dream for a min or two then wake back up. If it’s bed time I get a max 30-60 mins of sleep then wake up for a bit then sleep again. I enjoy it but the day after I feel groggy AF and I don’t take advantage of my free time which kind of sucks. I once mixed oxy with xanax and I would never do it again, I didn’t go hospital of anything but I feel it could of went sour very easily and I was naive

The vicoprofen hardly works I have to take 4-6 all at once for it to work on the pain and even then its only 30-40% better. I was recommneded to try gabapentin by many people so for the reason for visit I said the vicoprofen isn't working and I need another medication thats stronger and the woman at the front said well you need to go to a pain clinic which is what the GP said and 
I'm in the process of finding one and also I need an MRI which is on friday for the pain clinics to even BEGIN to start prescribing medicine and explaining options and treatment. I am concerned that I'm asking for specific meds and I mean if she forgets I want to just say its not working and I need something stronger. the GP said we need to go into the controlled substances category since tramadol didn't work which was when I got the vicoprofen and MRI prescription on my second visit. I know she isn't a pain specialist but I just want to have relief until I get the MRI done and find a pain clinic in my area because its hard and I'm still researching since I'm in a small town.

In the past I have used bupe and methadone to get high, back before when I was still only into pills and a few times when I couldn't get h, I've never got them from a doctor or in medical and proper manner. 

I'm not trying to swap addictions in my point, but my heroin habit is seriously fucking with my life and my habit is quite severe so cold turkey is not an option.

I was on opiates for about 7 years straight, mostly hydrocodone; then I got off of them and I've been using kratom for about 6-7 years now. I've tried a few opioid and opiates here and there but my dosages were always ridiculous and the experience lacking. I always thought that maybe it's because I didn't space enough time between the kratom but now I'm not sure. Last time I had an opiate was about 8 months ago, I got a bunch of free Vicodin, I waited until the next day to let the kratom get out of my system and I ended up taking all 12 that I had and barely got anything out of it, i feel like the acetaminophen had a stronger effect than the hydro did on me. A couple days ago I got half of a dilaudid, my friend regularly does only a quarter and he has similar experience with opioids as me, he said that a quarter is enough (for him) to get a good experience and a half is a strong dose for him. He suggested that I just try half for the first time just in case a quarter wasn't enough. I was really nervous, I've always drew the line at needles but things have been shitty and I've been hurting and I wanted to feel good for once.

Moments after I injected it I suddenly felt like I had been running for miles and my whole body got so heavy and relaxed, if I had been standing I think I would have collapsed. It was an amazing feeling, but it felt lacking, I didn't really get any euohoria, the whole experience seemed a lot lighter than what I was expecting and I kind of thought ""what's the big deal?"", it was nice but not nearly as great as what has always been described to me.

Anyways, I'm starting to wonder if something has changed with my body, even at the top of my opiate addiction I could still feel a few pain pills, I had a pretty high tolerance but if I took 12 Vicodin back then I would have definitely felt them. Could it be kratom that is causing this? The past few times I tried any other opioids I waited at least 12 hours but they didn't really work. The only ones that have worked were synthetic ones like suboxone, u-447700, and o-desmethyltramadol; but my dosages for all of those were very high except for the suboxone but it was still like double what I used to need and half the experience it used to be.

I dont know What an OD looks like from personal experience so i Will describe the events and hope you Can Tell me What these Signs mean. And help me learn.

We had been somewhere, and decided to leave, at this point he doesnt walk very Well, and was nodding already. we get to his apt, smoke half a joint and he passes out. my friend is impossible to Wake up for more than 4 seconds. He fell asleep with food in his mouth which i had to dig out of his mouth, and i really had to get in there digging untill i couldnt find any more so he could breathe. He wouldnt go to bed but kept falling out of his chair. I tried to force him to come stay with me so i could keep an Eye on him, but he was impossible to get through to. He ended up falling over the couch laying in some fucked Way. At this point i had been trying to leave for an hour, and everyone except me n my gf had left, but i couldnt leave my friend like this. Thats when i lost contact with him, i could slap him, touch his eyeball, whatever. Nothing Woke him up. If my gf wasnt Holding his left side he would have fallen to the Ground. So we wrapped him in Towels barber style with the head sticking out at the top because i was gonna throw a bucket of cold water in his face. In our group of friends we would do this as a joke when anybody fell asleep, but it was more like a glass of water, and he hated it so much. So i knew he would absolutely hate the bucket of water. therefore wrapping him in towels so he didnt get wet. He Woke up mad as hell About the water. Thank god. 
He was kinda mobile, but still falling over all the time. And konstantly close to falling asleep. I made his bed and put a bottle of water by his bedside and watched him sleep to check his breathing. I went home 15 minutes later and called him first thing this morning and Hes fine.

Btw, i live in a place where to get narcan/naloxone you need to Take a Fuckin course that Costs more than most of the people who need it Can afford, and after the fucking expensive course the narcan/naloxone still Costs money.

Tired AF, throw those suckers in the pajama pockets as I head up to bed. Crawl into bed, bags still in said pockets, and I wake up in the morning with em STILL in the pockets, subsequently melted AF. Like, this shit turned into liquid at some point during the night cause they're no longer solid balls but rather, well, you know. 

So I take them out of my pockets, and they I guess dried and warmed up and now that I'm smoking it tastes really nasty. Now it is very possible, and in my mind likely, that I just got product that doesn't taste. I have had heroin that tastes like this before, a few times, enough to not be alarmed or surprised, but not usually from this d-girl. She always has quality. But this shit tastes baaaaad. 

Could it be because it melted in my pockets? That possible? Thanks guys. ",1519030475.0

Can I store a water/codeine solution? I’d exctract it and just put the water in a small container. Other way would be getting rid of the water completely so that I’m left with mor wir less pure codeine I could put in empty gel caps. That could be problematic since from what I know high temperatures would destroy codeine.

7ykpwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ykpwj/when_it_rains_it_pours/,44,https://redd.it/7ykpwj,wilkiejake,When it rains it pours.,"So I just came across this post. I am a life long opiate lover/user. For the last 3 years I have been pumping H. Started with ECP and then my plug got a Tar connect. We took over the whole damn city. I was pumping a half oz or more everyday not to mention smoking 2 G’s to the head everyday. I even hired my home boy to run shit. Eventually I just sat back did my dope and collected money. 

About 4-5 months ago my plug straight dries up on the tar. He hands me a Quake of some shit powder H. I could not do enough of this powder to feel better. He was my only plug at the time so I didn’t know wtf to do. One of my buddies/ old customers had switched to Fent dope. Literally this was the only thing in town that would touch us and the mf selling the shit was knocking us over the head with the price. We couldn’t keep the money right. We was paying too much, and doing too much and had little other choice. Eventually the money dried up. Our favors ran out and we went down through there. 

Remember I said I was smoking 2 gs of tar... I turned to that mfing needle... I was not feeling better from snorting the little bit I was allotted that day. If you had asked me at any point up until I did it if I ever would and you would have gotten a loud resounding FUCK NO! Well I lied. I now know how it happens. Maybe easier for some but it was the hardest thing I ever argued with myself about. The plug never called us back even though we’d call him several times each and everyday. 

We had become unable to maintain our jobs. We had little to no guarantee of feeling well in the morning and so then spent the day finding a way to get it. I developed depression and anxiety. I went from the highest highs all the way down to the lowest lows. Without jobs our bills weren’t paid. So landlords want money. Fighting to keep water and electric on. 

Had so much riff raff running through my house I was being stolen from on a Daly basis. While I was in my stupor my woman who had been by my side riding and grinding for 5 years had taken over handling the operations. I had created a monster. She had never sold touched or even seen dope before me. 
I been hustling and getting high since 13 and I am now 29. This girl can hustle her ass off. So I just sat back and let her do her thing. She liked the feeling of being the big shot. 

Ultimately though I was boss and nothing happens without my approval... until we get hooked up with a new plug. He doesn’t really deal with white dudes like that but he’ll deal with females. He kept it professional and all that. All good except for now she had all the control, all the power. Her head swole up so big nobody could tell her nothing. She fucks the whole game up. Starts moving small weight to the 20 bag consumers. Making very little profit. Nobody wants to buy it any other way now. Now all the while we still wasn’t making enough money or staying with enough dope to make sure we were good everyday when we woke up but why. Because she’s got it all on lock down and she’s doing way more than anyone should or can and stay afloat. 

We get evicted from our nice 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house. While we should have been packing on those days leading to that day. She takes off and doesn’t come back for 2 days. She has my Tahoe. Which is our only vehicle at this point. She has the phone. She has all the money, and she has all the dope. She had left me to die. After 2 days she comes home. And tries telling me she was at her girl-friends house. Bull fuckin shit! Gives me a .1 and tries to dip out in my truck again. Uh-uh ain’t happening! We can both go. Nope she refuses. Some lame excuse about how she doesn’t want to leave the house empty cause of the landlords... smh gold bless her she’s an idiot. 

So while I’m not paying attention she has a ride pull up and she runs to the car. Once again gone with the phone. I have my phone that hasn’t been paid but I can call if I get on the internet. 

I go to her friends house and her friends car is there. When asked where she’s at she replies in the next town getting some jank. With who? Cause she was with this girl... oh her girls boyfriend had drove... yeah fuckin right! 

When I told her where I was shortly after the girl who is supposedly with her comes into the lit garage and turns the light off. Huh! Y’all are so stupid! Clearly we know what’s going on here. 

So I end up back at the house starting to deteriorate once again balling about her cheating ass while my sweet dog licks away my tears and tries to make me laugh. Just a man broken and a mans best friend. 

Once again was two days before she returned to the house. Swears up and down I’m tripping and she was doing exactly what she said. I’m not stupid.  But she is. She sat the phone down on the couch and had walked away. Hadn’t deleted her texts yet. She has been cuddled up with a friend of mine.... 

I kick open the bathroom door and started into this. Now behind me walks this big ball having ass home boy of mine. Gotta have big ones cause your disrespectful ass is brave to be in my mfing house right now. I tried to get him but was grabbed and wrapped up by this woman and others. I think I would have prolly killed his ass. Prolly lucky someone had stolen my hair trigger 1911 .45 not long before. 

If I hadn’t known the guy my beef would have been with her not him. My beef was with him tho because I not only knew him but used to be tight with him.   
I have now officially lost my entire life. 
I struggled to find a reason to want to live. So we pack the house on separate days and get out and split not saying another word. 
One day I Went to her to buy some dope cause my guy wouldn’t answer. She robs me. WOW! I don’t believe I deserved that one.  Ok whatever Start over let it go.. ok now a week goes by I’m back good but again my guy doesn’t answer. 
I’ll be god damned if she didn’t get me again. 

She has since called my parents to tell them about my dealings and has called my plug to try and get me cut off. He calls me and says I just heard this and that and I already knew who was behind this. I said bro she is on some next level type bullshit right now. He said if you was anyone else I’d have changed my number and cut you off but because it was you I had to call and see what was going on. That right there is mad love and I couldn’t be more greatful. 
Now today... sitting at a buddies house and she is calling his phone lookin for something. I hide in the closet and we let her in.  She starts talkin about how she called my dude and got me cut off and she’s going out there tonight. I’m just laughing now because oh how is she wrong. She walks back outside and I come out lock the bedroom door and gather my things. She comes back to the door and so I put my bag on my shoulder, I unlock the door and I step out into the hall. She must have jumped 10 ft back and had a look on her face like she seen a ghost. Jaw Dropped. I said “good luck going tonight” and I walked out the house and down the street. 
I called my dude and he’s like she’s tripping she ain’t coming here. Lmao. 
Then I get introduced to a new plug today for much cheaper. I’m like holy shit are good things actually happening to me. Oh btw i skipped over the part about how she came and stole my dog, and that my truck now has no plates because my insurance lapsed. 
Now here I sit in my truck. Parked outside of a hotel I paid to stay in last night but don’t have money for today. Freezing cold can’t go nowhere and got nowhere to go. I got a little jank and a little H. But nowhere to belong. I’m sick and I’m tired and I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired and also hungry. How the fuck did it all happen so fast? What the hell do I do now? I can’t go on like this much longer. 
I’m not sure why I wanted to share this story. Really I couldn’t possibly have told you every fucked up thing that has happened in this time period, but you got a good idea. 
I think maybe I’m struggling to find an end to the story or maybe a moral? 
It could be that I’m lonely sitting in this cold ass truck alone. 
Fuck this fucking wonderful amazing ass drug that I love and hate. I can’t take any more. Someone help!",1519021470.0

We met at the locutorio she ran, where I made cheap phone calls, foreign and domestic.  The clerk at Hostel Dax liked her, too.  One night I saw her at the hostel, but she wasn’t there to see me.

She and her manager at the locutorio let me make phone calls and pay them later.  Someone had been stabbed to death right there, where she worked.  No good reason for it, but the person died on the floor choking in a puddle of his own blood.  Sarah's manager saw the whole thing.  It had only been a few months.

There were a couple of computers, where I checked my email.  A girl I met in another city sent me two or three a week.  They always started the same, “Dear Gringo, you are a savage.  No one has ever done to me the things you did to me.  When are you coming back, so I can see you?” She never got a response.  I made long-distance phone calls to my family asking for money.  The money always came.

""I don’t know how long I'm going to make it, Mama,""

""What do you mean, Riley?""

""I think I'm going to die soon.  Something bad is going to happen.  I know it.""

There was a pause on the line.  Her voice was shaky but tried to reassure me.  ""Why would you think that?  Nothing is going to happen, Riley.  It's going to be fine.  There is nothing to worry about.""  She must have known I was getting high with phone calls like that.  It was before I started shooting up again.

""Someone is going to kill me.  I'm sorry, Mama.  I'm going to die.  I love you.""  I hung up.

It is caused by Suboxone, i am sure i can lower it, and if by the grace of god i can get prescribed ANY opiate, I want to know how to approach the subject with the doctor. 

For those of you who do not know, i am a ""veteran"" suboxone user. I have been taking it for over 10 years. 8-9 years straight. I was the first person out of anyone i knew, in my area, to use Suboxone. 

Its worked for its purpose, but i am facing a very long uphill battle with pain, and suboxone really isnt good for this (EDIT: NOT WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 13 YEARS) on a daily basis. It lacks the pain killing efficacy profile of other opiates . It definitely ""helps"" but the medicines that i use to actually treat pain are causing more side effects. medicines like meloxicam, flexirl, soma, robaxin, and many more. i have even tried other non-narcotic pain relievers. there are a few i have not tried, i will admit that. but that is becomng madness .

The withdrawals from Suboxone itself are horrendous, but it tends to always give me the same feeling on a daily basis. the only downside is that it lacks signifigant painkilling effects even when doseage is increased. 


that being said, i get high as shit off of suboxone.

but i do have a tolerance; subs mechanism of action seems to somehow not effect tolerance when taken at a low dose.



my tolerance should be around 20mg of oxy or hydrocodone two times per day (lets say LESS THAN 40mg a day) if i am being absolutely realistic interms of equivalent doseages.

i am sure icould last with less, but i am in the worst pain i have ever had in my entire life and i do not know how to explain everything to my doctor
this is partially due to my jaw being fucked up. its almost at the point in which i can no longer talk without severe pain so i have severe anxiety about going to the doctor, and wasting time. car rides make me vomit due to the pain. 


I plan to see a Neurologist first, because i have only seen my Primary 1 time. This is because my original primary who retired, would write refferals without seeing me; which i got used to, he was a very nice doc. He retired at the right time.


----------------------------
*TLDR*
I really need all the tips i can get. I have never pursued the 'legal opiates' route before outside of suboxone and when i have had surgeries (and subsequent ER visits for non-healing things that also got me opiates),as well as a few times being sick. feel free to write here or pm me.

i do live in a state with prescription monitoring. 


i am also prescribed klonopin, which i do wish to stay on. tonight; i used marijuana distillate with diclofenac , robaxin, suboxone, tylenol and klonopin to bring down the swelling in my ear and neck (which stems from my jaw) that i have had all day and i am now feeling good enough to write this message

Let me lay this out for you. 

I was hangin out at Bud's place for a few days (he's doing great btw) and at one point this girl, we'll call her CumDumpster. Another Homie shows up. Over the course of these 3 days I left a few times a day for a few hours at a time to do take care of other situations and get into trouble. Did 1 shot of meth when I woke up after the first night, and that was it. Bud, Other Homie and CumDumpster smoke meth continuously throughout. I go on one of my side trips and I thought I would end up with cash, instead I come back with a bunch of heroin. I don't ever want to have that shit in my body again so I give some to the three of them and go sell the rest while they roll along. Important to note, when we were getting in the car CumDumpster is insisting on taking shotgun and handling the deals. Bud suggests she sit in the back with him because you never know what can go wrong until it's happening, and it's Cujuabled's job to handle the deals. She flips shit accusing him of treating her like an asshole and being mean. We sell heroin and dropped Homie off on the way back. CumDumpster is... having fun. She's  flailing her everything around, she'll bonk herself on the head before tilting it and letting out an, ""Eeee!"" Then she'll turn to me and say, ""Oh hahahaha, when my body makes that sound it means I need to go to bed."" Constantly making strange noises and gestures I began to get concerned. She drinks like 2 four lokos when we get back to Buds. 

I wake up to her screaming at Bud, again accusing him of treating her like shit. Bud runs to me and says, ""I don't know what the fuck I did, but she's yelling and my roommate said he's about to kick me out early so I don't have the extra week, and CumDumpster gives zero fucks, bro. Please help me get her ass out."" Well god damn it good morning guys. Pack CumDumpsters shit, get her in my car, Bud walks up to my window, hands me ten dollars and says, ""get her home safe please,"" Yap on it. We hit the road and I realize she's now smoked off her fucking face. She's gone. That bitch is somewhere else. She's rolling around in the passenger seat saying things to me that seemed to be pulled from the middle of a conversation that never began, was never initiated. I hand her a cigarette and she thinks it's a shot. She begs me to take her tanning real quick, keeps trying to have me drop her at random houses, passes out mid sentence and comes back in a perceived situation that isn't actually happening. I get her home and walk her inside, when I'm leaving she grabs me in the doorway and slams me with this fat ass kiss that has a bonus tongue down my throat. I roll with it for like 7 seconds before I remember Bud is low-key in love with her and I'm sure she pretty much lives on a dick, so I leave after she lays down on the couch and knocks out instantly. Finally. 

This is where my dilemma begins. Later in the night she keeps calling me, so I keep ignoring her. She sends a text claiming she's at Burger King in a part of the county that's the sticks. This place is literally one main road, small shops along it and surrounded by woods, some of my worst memories happened out there and I avoid it at all costs, everyone out there is fuckin bonkers. She's at BK and claims no one wants to hang with her so I should. Huh. Well I wonder why in the ass gaping fuck no one would wanna hang out with her in such a state. Also bitch isn't it your bed time? I decide fuck it, I have a little over an hour until I can pull off this next move and unpredictable is far from boring, so I make it to BK. I immediately inform her of my timeline, after about an hour I have to leave without you. I'll kick it until then but get something in line for when that time comes.

She does no such thing. Instead she takes Snapchat videos while smoked off her face making no sense, throws fuckin chicken nuggets covered in bbq sauce in my car, and promptly knocks the fuck out in the passenger seat. I wake her up, ""CumDumpster, look man, you have 30 more minutes, please get on your phone and find someone to come here because I don't want to leave you in the cold. Especially out here, after midnight at that."" 

She kicks at my face, ""Go away!""

""Dude you're in my car. I don't have to be here right now but I am. Get on your fuckin phone and don't act like a kindergartener please."" She remains silent in a sleeping position. She lives about an hour away so I don't have time to take her home. More time passes, more attempts at getting her to cooperate shot down.

""Look CumDumpster, I don't know what you thought was going to happen here when you made nest in my car, because when I draw my boundaries I stick to them. Safety net for you or not, I'm getting you out of this car in 5 minutes and leaving. You're not leaving me another option."" She starts crying saying why does everyone treat her like this. I answer. ""Maybe it's because you're insanely co-dependant, hold this unrealistic expectation of everyone to spend their resources, time and energy sorting you out because you refuse to do anything yourself?"" She says she loves me. Great. Get out. I help her pack her things and walk her to a bench. She starts apologizing for putting me in this position and for being so uncooperative, and I tell her it's fine and I care about her, I just hope she learns from it, because I don't operate with that type of thing. She makes some calls, 2 people told her to fuck off I'm done with your shit, 1 guy said he'd be there shortly but he needs some time. We have a long hug, I give her a knife and a cigarette and say good luck. 

I get in my car and then this thing happens I don't think I'll ever forget, I can't pinpoint why, it just stuck out so much in this situation. As I'm pulling away she says to me, ""Hey, your name is Sweetheart in my phone,"" and gives a melting smile with a genuine glow in her eyes, they're this light shade of smooth, steely blue. Like bitch I'm leaving you in the cold after midnight in an area where you can only hope the crews that run around at night kill you and don't just leave you wishing they did. Her phone was on 3% when I left. 

So am I a piece of human trash? I drew my boundary, gave her plenty of time and warning to figure something out, and she fought every step of the way. She knew what would happen. She chose to let that happen instead of find an alternative. She made that decision. The few people in my immediate I've laid this out to say I'm horrible, but I feel like with so many chances to keep it from happening and her refusing to take them, it's on her. I called many times but didn't hear from her for about 36 hours, she called an hour ago and she's fine. But still, am I horrible?",1518998569.0
