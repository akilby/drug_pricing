i have a friend who has been on and off heroin for at least a decade. he knows what's going to happen to him when he stops, but as someone who has never even tried it and has mostly shunned opiate-based painkillers (including after childbirth and other serious bodily harm) i feel i have very little clue as to what he's going through. my addictions are limited to occasional booze binges, cigarettes and my adderall prescriptions. obviously, i have more of a penchant for uppers. 

anywho, this friend has burned all his bridges in the few places he could go, and is stuck in another state, living in a dope house, where he's sure to keep using. he's managed to save enough money to get in his car and make the 5-7 hour trip to my home, where I have a couple of supportive folks who like this guy enough (despite his past transgressions) to support my wanting to help him. he wants to be back where i live now anyway to try to rebuild things between his ex and her child that he loves like his own. i know these are things that commonly occur in addicts and that they often relapse, but i'm going to give it a chance for myself and try to be the supportive person he doesn't seem to have had, ever. 

he will be here by friday, and has already warned me he'll be sick for at least a few days. i asked him if there's anything i can get for him to help, and he suggested ice cream and nausea meds. i can handle that. what i'm not sure he'll tell me is the gory details, or the stupid shit he might want/try to do. 

that's where y'all come in. i need to know the brutal, dirty, awful details, both of what he'll be going through and what i'm likely to encounter. i'm not squeamish, and i prefer to know the worst ahead of time. if he's going to puke on me, okay. if i'm going to need to prepare to incapacitate him, i'd like to know that, as i'm an average-sized female. i am no stranger to taking someone down, but i prefer not to have to do so. just want to not be toooooo surprised. 

anyway, thanks in advance for any help, and i'm not here to judge. i firmly believe that if a person is happy doing whatever they're doing, then it's not my place to tell them they're wrong. if they're unhappy and they want help, all i can do is try to help. i don't know what else to say without being all naive and optimistic. i just want to help my friend make the effort he wants to make. 

EDIT: thanks again to all of you for all of the advice, but it's a moot point now. he went radio silent yesterday so i decided to check the local jails where he lives and found out he was arrested for possession yesterday afternoon. $100k bond, 3rd degree felony. he has some priors, so it's likely to be more prison time. nothing i can do about that. i find it awfully coincidental that he got arrested less than 24 hours after being offered a way out of that mess. 

EDIT 2: he ended up getting out, as it turns out he wasn't even in possession of anything when he was arrested (though a companion was). i went to pick him up and brought him back with me. he's doing really remarkably well compared to what i had been expecting. he does best during the day and evening, when he's feeling social and wanting to see people. he's eating food (quite a lot, actually) and doing a great job handling what he's going through. he hasn't balked at any of my ""rules"" and so far, we're good. i took him to see his best friends/""brothers"" (one of them is dating my sister and the other is their roommate) which seemed to make a huge improvement in his mood. then we went to a biker event with my parents last night and he had 2 beers (he cut himself off) and played some pool with me and my cousin. he hasn't had the vomiting, but he does get the shakes really badly when he tries to go to bed at night. i lay with him and try to hold him when this happens, or let him cuddle up to me when he starts freezing. he says he's surprised it's not much worse this time, either. he last used 4 days ago, and so far, his worst day was the day before yesterday. he got to talk to the girl he's in love with and they made plans for her to come see him early next week, so he's in great spirits. i really really hope this is the last time he ever has to go through this, and i try to assure him that it will be. thanks again to all of you for all of your help. i now feel like i was over-prepared for his withdrawal, and i'm glad for that as it has helped me remain strong for him when he's shaking and miserable and i want to cry, too. if any of you have the desire to clean up and get back on track, i genuinely hope that you have someone supportive and strong enough to help you do that, because i don't think he could do it alone and i can't imagine anyone else could, either. you all have been great. i'll try to update periodically to let everyone know how this is going at different intervals and if he stays clean.

Anyone here who can 'take or leave' opiates? Like, find them fun to do - great to do, even - but just CHOOSE not to take them all the time?

I have an essentially unlimited supply. I'm sitting on about 4,000mg of Oxy in my house right now, yet I just haven't chosen to use any in the past couple of weeks because I've been busy with other things or just not in the mood. I just bought a PS4 and I've been playing it a lot after work instead.

I love opiates. I took my first one 8 years ago, I've had a regular supply for 3 years. I just don't feel that I could ever get addicted to them. For me it's just another hobby. Sometimes I'll choose to take them, but other times I prefer to go to the gym or go out for a nice dinner or play some video games.

I take around 100/mg day. I'm considering moving to suboxone shortly. Regardless, I've had an issue going on for at least a year now, just trying to figure out if anyone else gets these...

I've always had sleep issues, from anxiety, sleep paralysis, but this is something totally different.

What is very odd about this it seems to happen 1000x more when I take naps during the day. While I'm close to falling asleep I get pretty bad body jolts. Almost like I'm having a mini seizure. The brain ones feel so strange. It almost feels like there is a shortage going in and out in my brain. I've also noticed there are times when I'm near the brink of falling asleep and my body will wake up gasping for air quickly almost like I wasn't breathing. I've read that there is a split second where the body stops breathing before the crossover into sleep, but this seems more severe. 

I'm only posting it in this sub-forum because I think it is somehow related to opiate use. 

Obviously I know seeing the doctor is the only real way of figuring out what is wrong with me, but I'm just curious if anyone else in this sub-forum has experienced similar symptoms with/without opiate use. ",1398904735.0

I shot her up since she cant do it herself, then she dumped some out for me (probably about 2/3 of what she did.

I shook her pretty hard and continued yelling her name. I slap her in her face and start doing chest compressions while still shaking her, trying to get her to wake up. Thankfully, she gasps for air and slowly comes to with no idea what the hell was going on. I then proceed to give her the biggest tightest hug ever while bawling my eyes out. She still doesn't really know what was going on. She thought she had s seizure, and described the confusion she felt as how it feels to come out of a seizure.

So I have shot subutex pills in the past with no issue so I figured it would be all good to go ahead and shoot 2mg of my suboxone film. I read up on opiophile how to prepare it and all that jazz and went ahead and did the 2mg.  I immediately got an overwhelming rush that made me dizzy and start sweating and I couldn't breathe. I then began to vomit uncontrollably for the next few minutes. Managed to crawl back into my bed and curl into a ball and all of that bad stuff subsided within 15 minutes and then I felt completely fine. 

I was sure when all of that was happening that I must have given myself precipitated withdrawls because I only waited like 13 hours after shooting dope to shoot the sub but since it went away so fast I guess it wasn't that. I'm guessing it was just some kind of bad reaction to the nalaxone? Because as I said, I have shot 2mg subutex in pill form before and I was fine.

This may be weird but it has helped me through withdrawals the past few days. When I can sleep, I tend to become drenched in sweat and it makes me sheets, pillows, and entire bed just smell...bad. 

For some reason I feel like sweating from cold/hot switches is not the same as sweat from working out.

My simple solution has been to sleep in a sleeping bag on top of my covers. While the sleeping bag causes me to sweat even more, it's at least contained. I can wake up and take a shower and not be repulsed by a completely wet bed. I have roommates that do not, as far as I know, know about my opiate use - and washing my sheets daily, with no girls coming over, was just a bit sketchy. I believe i'm at the tail end of the physical withdrawals - and now begins the mental part. And getting back to life. I hope this helped someone.

(usually at night you take it at bed), then you get a rebound in the receptors which increases natural endorphins.

 I know its not going to get me high or anything but i was wondering if anyone who isnt addicted has used LDN for a period of time, and can give me any input into how it affects opiate usage.

I'm hoping it might reduce my opiate tolerance while at the same time increasing endorphins(making me feel a tiny bit better) from the rebound i get when i wake up from the downregulation from the naltrexone.

My point for taking it, however, is related to an auto-immune disease and my immune system. LDN has been making great strides in treating auto-immune disorders.

So I received 10 M-Box 30 oxycodone. So it happens that 5 of them are slightly taller ( mean just barely) then the other 5. Nothing else different M imprint is perfect and the 30 above the line. They are blue with a light speckling.

If I break in the inside of the large one open the very middle is a white color. The taste is very bitter and chemically and if I hold it on my tongue for 2-3 minutes it goes slightly numb for around 3 minutes. They are are also extremely hard you can't break them with your nail on the perforation mark.  I had to bite them to break it. 

The high is more of a head high with no pupil constriction and no itchy like I normally get. Something seems off. 

Anyone have experience in this especially the numbing of tongue if I leave it on it and the high is more in the head and not a full body like im used to.

until soon its can i stay for just a few nights, its your doorbell ringing at 3 in the morning, its crying as you shout at him to get the fuck off your porch lest the neighbors start giving you dirty looks every time you leave your apartment...

recently i'd been banging up coke all day following an all nighter of decent quality dope when my doorbell rings, to this familiar fellow, perhaps some of you know him, here to express his condolences...  

you see, my best friend recently passed away, no less, on my living room floor, i'd found him upon waking up in the afternoon after a night of partying, face up, nose congealed with a thick slurry of mucous...  the police on arrival assumed drug overdose, as i answered all of their questions in earnest, but i knew better, had to be a pulmonary embolism, my suspicions later confirmed by autopsy...

well you see the hurt puppy clearly had another agenda, he wanted me to help him score some dope see, he had ten bucks for a bag, see...  i politely explained i couldn't help him, as my dboy delivers, no small amounts, and as i don't currently have a habit, i didn't plan on scoring myself, especially with him, who'd undoubtably want me to throw him ""just one more bag"".  

alas i found myself on an adventure to ghettoville.  it was not till i arrived in said part of town that i realized i'd failed to get properly dressed before leaving the house, i hurriedly walked, as to shake away the cold air from my shriveling cock, exposed to the elements clothed only by obnoxiously fluorescent yellow athletic shorts, a magnet to the jaded eyes of the police, quite obviously not unaware of our intentions in visiting this notorious part of town.

my ""friend"" if i can call him that assured me that we'd be hitting a low key spot and we shouldn't expect any heat and indeed the house was tucked away in an area whose only other occupants were warehouses and industry...  the whole operation was shockingly brazen, at least twenty people were gathered there around the gates of the dirt yard, in which we were hurriedly rushed through to conduct our business as barely clothed children raced around our feet pushing plastic tonka trucks around the filth in which we stood copping.

we fixed upstairs in a nearby abandoned apartment occupied by a few neighborhood residents...  seemed apparent the arrangement was that they were ""watching"" the place for the owner of the building, a 2x4 against the door secured us safely inside.  

having never been exposed to this side of the dope game i wanted the fuck out, and the fuck out we got.  on the train platform i was accosted by a man who claimed ""us white people gotta look after each other"" after i refused him a cigarette, attempting to engage us in ""shop talk,"" about the current best cop spots, best bags, and least heat.  i told him to fuck off.

some speedballs later i kicked hurt puppy the fuck out, yelling at him for so obviously taking advantage of my grief.  what the fuck man!!  he countered that he knew i'd be doing drugs anyway... well...  yeah...  but we both know thats not the smartest fucking way for me to deal with my sorrow haha.  jesus christ the nerve...  of course begging me to ""throw him a bag,"" i'd explained i was splitting all the shit i'd scored down the middle with him, he didn't seem to understand what that meant, just continuing to beg for a bag.  okay...  have one bag instead of the bag and a half i was going to give you.  fine.  fuck.

he shows up at my door later in the night begging for one more hit of coke, he can't sleep he says...  like thats going to help you fucking sleep, ha!  get the fuck off my porch.  of course he's crying he ""just wants to talk"" i just want to be alone through this, can't you understand i explain and he just won't go, crying louder i have to literally scare him away, raising my voice, widening my eyes in demonic anger, don't i have any compassion he's pleading, COMPASSION?  COMPASSION?  you're accusing ME of lacking compassion?

after literally slamming the door in his face he finally trudges down the street, screaming out at the top of his lungs in anguish like an old palestinian woman mourning her son or something, and i felt just a tiny, tiny bit bad.

My SO and I have been together for 3 years. When we met, we were both in recovery and for the first two years and some odd months, we didn't use opiates at all. A few months ago, we stated using again, not regularly, but once or twice a week. For me, using actually ups my sex drive, but for him, opiates kill it. It's really rough; we still have a fairly decent sex life, but lately, I so often feel like I almost have to harass him into it. It makes me feel so rejected and unwanted, and those are rough feelings for me because I've never really experienced them before. I think usually, girls have the upper hand in this area because guys tend to be so much hornier and willing to do it when the opportunity arises, so now that the shoe is on the other foot, it's uncomfortable and I really don't like it. 

Sometimes, he kind of acts like sex is a chore when we're high, I think mainly because it's extremely difficult for him to orgasm. Don't get me wrong, most of the time I want to do it, we do, but lately I've been feeling like he's only doing it to appease me, not because he really wants to. It just makes me feel down and insecure. We've talked about it and he laughs it off, saying how ridiculous it is that I feel this way, but I just can't help it. I've never started touching and kissing someone only to be told, ""not now"". He has no problem getting a boner, so I just don't understand why it seems to be so much work for him. He acts like it's a chore, and it makes me feel inadequate and taken for granted.

Recently there's been a crackdown on pain management doctors in the U.S., especially the South Eastern area. Unfortunately my doctor was one that they came down on. Even though I have medical records, MRIs and numerous other test results, I'm having a very hard time finding another doctor that is willing to prescribe the meds I am on. (2 of the meds they are having issues with is Methadone and Percocet, both relatively low doses and prescribed for chronic pain.)
Since my Percocet Is almost out, after a lot of debating on what to do, I've decided to try Poppy Seed Tea. My question is this....will the tea be equal to what it's like when I take my Percocet since I'm still on the Methadone?  When you're on Methadone it lowers the effects of other opiates and I certainly don't want to overdose. 
I'd be interested to hear from anyone that takes PST for chronic pain as well to hear how well it works compared to other medications.

She doesn't really care and is out with my pregnant teenage sister. ""I bought some paracetemol with codeine, so you'll just have to have that."" Yes, she means one box of Boots 8/500mg. Given that I need 90mg of codeine per dose, this isn't going to get very far. And she expects us to be sharing it. She can piss off, quite frankly. I don't have any other means of obtaining the meds.

I am a frequent contributor to this subreddit, but because of fent's reputation here, I've decided to post this anonymously. I am aware of the dangers associated with fent, so I would like to gather feedback from individuals with experience and knowledge using this med. I have been using opiates for the last six years with the frequency increasing substantially the last two years. My DOC is oxycodone and my typical dose for recreational use is between 90-120mgs ingested orally. I also use ECP quite often and my standard dose is 3 bags (should be a point each, but usually just a bit less) of high quality product insufflated and/or rectally administered. I am a male in his mid twenties with no significant, preexisting health conditions (formerly a division I athlete but have not been in shape like that for 2-3 years), and weigh approximately 190 pounds. Given the aforementioned details, I would like to gather insight into how to properly administer this med for both pain relieving properties and recreational usage. From what I understand, this product is a transdermal, gel patch and can be abused, but I am not necessarily interested in doing so (but would still like to hear about smoking/chewing/sublingual usage). The only other med I may co-administer would be adderall IR (max 30mgs every 4-6 hours, 2 times a day if at all). I would appreciate any feedback, insight, and anecdotes provided, as well as harm reduction so long as it is not along the lines of ""throw it away/burn it/trade it for other stuff, this stuff WILL KILL you!!"" The main question I need answered is if it will be safe to apply the patch as intended, and if so, what I can expect given my current tolerance and physical attributes. Any other information would still be very helpful, as I am considering administering the product in other manners.

I had a couple years of total sobriety in there, and a couple years of balls to the wall, using every single day in there too. Right now, me and my SO use once or twice a week, but we are going to take a month or so off shortly because I know how insane I can get. Lucky for me, we've already stocked up on subs, gabapentin, clonodine and lope. My thing was always oxy - I started off with the OG OC 80's and when those disappeared, switched to roxys. Then I took my two years off only to return and find that, at least in Florida, even those are hard to come by. Everything is dialudid now, and since I only ever snorted my shit, they are ok but nothing to write home about. 

I knew my SO had IVed a couple time before, but I lost a brother when I was 16 to IVing heroin. I'm also a complete needlephobe, and freak out getting a damn shot at the doctor, so those factors combined led to me being completely against it. My associations with needles are death and terror. 

More and more of my close friends have been doing it though, and then a few months ago, I started reading this sub religiously and realized what a fucking waste it is to snort dillys. Finally, a week ago, I bit the bullet and let my friend and SO hit me. 

HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT. It is like a brand new drug to me. I instantly was pissed at myself for all of the d's I snorted over the last year and basically wasted. Don't get me wrong, I'm still a tremendous needlephobe and I know I couldn't bang shit by myself if I tried (I can't even administer my own epipen out of fear of that damn needle and it's an auto injector... sad but true), but I'm SO LUCKY I only tried this right before a break because I know what a habit this could become provided I had someone around to help. I get more fucked up IVing a half a D than I would from snorting 7 of them, it's absolutely insane. That rush is the most beautiful fucking feeling imaginable. 

So I guess I should say thanks to you guys. I always figured my SO and friends were exaggerating the difference in intensity between snorting and shooting D's just to get me to try it, but then I read and listened to what you all had to say and realized that there just might be something to what they're saying. I even feel like the legs are pretty good, although I chalk that up to not using regularly enough to develop much of a tolerance. Now the only shitty part of dillys is waiting out the necessary 4 hours in between shots so I'm able to fully feel the rush lol.

As most of you know, fentanyl is the most potent of the opiods one has any reasonable chance obtaining... Knowing this, I put my friend up to synthesizing fentnayl and although he reported a huge loss in a purification step (60%) the final yield is of sound purity and amazing for any first attempt. 

My long awaited gram of fentanyl is finally on its way. :)

That said, I am a generally opiate-naive person. In fact, I only occasionally dabble in drugs (I find both psychedelics and opiates to be quite interesting) so I know how dangerous this potentially is. Essentially, I am being sent thousands upon thousands of doses of what could be considered a potential chemical weapon..

I must learn how to make a solution. 

Dilution via liquid is quite easy but I would like to know if any of you guys and gals have had success using a powdered mixture without any life-threatening hotspots of potency. 

It should go without saying that gloves, glasses and a mask will be worn at all times while handling this substance. My number one priority (behind doing it...) is safety. 

Thanks for any HR and safety input!

Before that, I used a variety of different drugs, and if it can be railed, you best believe it went up my nose. Since starting on the dope, I haven't really done anything else besides the occasional blue or some IR Addy that I got a couple weeks back. So my question is about my nasal passage ways. For the past couple weeks, the dope has been giving me a quick burn right after I hit it. It usually burns both nostrils but its more prevalent in the right. At first I figured it was just some cut or some fire since its burned a couple times before. But I've been getting different dope almost every time for the past few weeks and it all burns. I noticed when I blow my nose that there is more blood than usual and a lot of times its fresh and not congealed. I haven't gotten any blood running out of my nose, just when I blow it/pick at it in small amounts. So basically, how fucked up do you guys think my nose is?

I can't even count the times I've done that before and relapsed the next morning. I actually reached out and told my mom and I'm going to rehab/suboxone/counselor all that tomorrow. But anyways here's another piece. 



As I lie awake tonight

I feel like I'm goin insane

Like my mind has finally derailed, 
off the tracks like a train.

The mental stress I'm under now is worse than any pain

Maybe it's time you drop them pills,
man you know you're not the same. 

You continue tryin to fool yourself,
like this high will last forever

Quit lyin to yourself man,
this should be your main endeavor 

You're dancin with the devil now,
it's up to you to make it better

Don't you think it's past the point that you should put em down?

You lost your job, then your girl,
plus more friends than you can count

Now obviously what's going next,
is your sanity

Then shortly after that, 
it's gonna be your family

The voices in your head are right

You're finally goin insane

You're 19 years old,
This is too much mental strain

You should be livin life,
Workin on your future

But instead you're in the fast lane
to become the next young shooter 

As I write these lines right now,
I can barely focus

I'm sad for all of us

That will soon be another soul,
lost to dope

But even in the state we're in, 
above all hold on to hope

But then there's the reality,
It may be you, or it may be me

But one of out addictions 
WILL be another junkie casualty 

If you're trying to quit,
Please don't stop

It may be a hard road, 
But stay for the ride

Make yourself reach the top

Don't become another junkie,
Or a ""could have been""

State addiction in the eyes,
and tell him

THIS IS THE END. 

This path will lead you one of three places
Depression, jail, or death

That's reality. 

Face it.

EDIT: Just want to make it clear that I know he lawfully has the right not to treat me. I didn't word the title very well. I don't mean 'take action' as in legal action. What I'm confused about is whether he's right that no therapy will work whilst I'm using codeine. He was very insistent that it can't help me. 

I hate to be dramatic but I can't do this much longer. The psychiatrist and nurse I have atm (I am diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder, severe anxiety and depression, as well as an 8-year codeine addiction) are the first people that I have actually liked thus far. And then I go to my appointment today and my psych basically switches on me. I have been offered psychotherapy in the past on a number of occasions and I have said yes to it. For some reason my psych never referred me, but would bring it up at appointments. Today he tells me that no therapist is going to see me as long as I'm using codeine. He blames pretty much everything on my addiction despite the fact that I am diagnosed with BPD...? I told him that I had to respectfully disagree and feel I deserve a chance at the therapy, to which he replies in the most degrading tone, ""No. Why!?"" Why do I deserve a chance at therapy? Seriously? The entire appointment was him belittling me, which hasn't happened before. I'm just so confused and feel so helpless. Eventually he threatened to discharge me if I don't kick the habit. The thing is that it's not even a huge habit. It's codeine for starters, and I only take about 270mg a day. Like WTF. I KNOW it's a problem, without doubt, but I can't help but feel he's blowing it way out of proportion. 

He said that no therapist will treat me because psychotherapy is ""too deep"" and will make me use more codeine. I reasoned that I feel there's much, much less chance of that happening than of someone getting clean, finding the therapy too overwhelming and relapsing. 

Can anyone shed some light here?

Even as a lurker this has always been the place to come read along and find some sort of comfort with others living a life very close to mine. The last 7 years of my life have been a slow build to this epic shit show I call my everyday life nowadays. This addiction has taken everything from me and rewarded my use with  nothing at all. Countless times in the past year I prayed for death when i would close my eyes at night, hoping that this nod would be the last. How would I EVER repair this fucking path of destruction I have left in my wake? My beautiful wife had no clue for so long. I recall our honeymoon, I brought along six 10mg Tabs. They were more than enough for a few days of fun at the time since i had NO tolerance at all. I wish I could go back to those days and beat myself fucking senseless for opening the door to this hell. It is all my fault and I blame no one along the way. I just liked to get high. It helped dull the pain of my childhood. I am not special, I probably had it no worse than the majority of people with fucked up childhoods, but pain is all relative. 
 

I threw away my college time, maxed out credit cards, borrowed, stole, pawned, ripped off, conned, and schemed my way through the last 7 years since getting married. It's probably no coincidence that my use skyrocketed once getting married. I was completely unprepared to take on the responsibilities, but with a little warm blanket wrapped around me I gave it one hell of a go. Its not been all doom and gloom from the time i started. There was a time I maintained a full time job, a band, an LLC and had many friends. Slowly though its all come and gone. I lost my job a few weeks ago when my contract finally ended after many years. All of the sudden my bills, rent and $200 a day habit were in jeopardy. 



After a few days I landed an even BETTER job, things looked ok. Just had to pass this Urine test which i knew i could do. I have active scripts for every opiate under  the sun. On the final call before i took the test the lady said the words that made me turn pale, ""HAIR TEST"".... Long story short i fucking nuked any chance of getting that job right at that moment. I partied with some old music buddies about 2 month prior and enjoyed some coke. Again.... this is all my fault and no one else. In the past week I tried to clean up and folded a few days in. I have been sick the whole time. I had a wonderful offer last night, guy called me out of the blue, he offered to deliver. BINGO. So he rolls through and does a quick hand off out the window about a block from my place. ( I didn't give him MY address) Smooth handoff and he is gone. This is a guy I have dealt with off and on waaaaaay longer than my number 1 guy. I walk home and bust open the bag, nothing but store brand acetaminophen. You gotta be fucking kidding me. I call him and get the old ""oh yeah i will be right back"" bullshit. Of course its bullshit and I know i will never see him again. In 7 years i have been really good about not getting jacked. Like insanely vigilant about it.  


In my withdrawals these past 2 months though it has happened twice, its like im slipping or losing my edge. Both of them have been with me for pretty much the entire 7 years. I am not a shithead to deal with. I spend a ton and even throw in a few extra bucks here and there. ESPECIALLY if its later in the evening or if someone has to drive out of the way for me. I have some user friends who I could usually call up who knew where to get random pills here and there.  i always throw them a handful for facilitating the deal and doing the run. Usually something along the lines of as follows. ( If i pick up say 20 norcos. Then i will buy them 5 on top of that for making the calls and picking it up. Or if buying 30's i will always spend enough to get them 1 or 2. If I had alot of cash at the time I always picked them up more.) I think its  good deal for making the calls. These were always last resort deals because 9/10 times i could find it on my own. 



Here in the last 6 months those guys have quit returning my calls most of the time. Flat out  out telling me that buy out all of their dealers leaving them nothing when they want to go get it. HA, its actually one of the only times I have felt like a dick for buying drugs. All of that said, the shit is definitely getting much harder to find around my way. A couple of other middle men i dealt with along the way got out all together, be it on their own or to other reasons.  H is also semi hard to track down out here and pretty hit or miss in my experience. I used to naively tell myself that when H became my only option it was time to hang it up. That is exactly where things are. Now please don't kill me just yet, I used to tell myself that shit when i was first starting out. At the time i had somehow convinced myself that pills and H were SOOOOOO much different. What a god damn joke. 



Growing up I had reoccurring dreams and fears that I would die at 27.  I am 27 now. This has very easily been the hardest year of my life. Once again..... ALL MY FAULT.  I only have 2 months left before 28 and I really feel like im self fulfilling that morbid prophecy. Tonight i caved in and went to pick up. I managed to not get ripped off and the second i was high, got the most overwhelming sense of guilt. I sit here typing this  out knowing i will be sick again in less than 24 hours and there is nothing to stop it. My bills are still piled up and all i can think about is not getting fucking sick. Like a week of wd's are the worst fucking thing on the planet, compared to losing what little bit i have.  There was no point to this post, other than to actually visualize my thoughts. i got high tonight and sat on the bank of the Mississippi river for two hours fighting the urge to just end this charade. I feel like I have fucked my girl up so bad, i truly hate myself for what my problems have done to her. She is honestly the only thing that kept me from jumping tonight. Not a god damn soul that walked by asked me with the tears rolling down my face tonight if i was ok. no one cared. All i could play through in my head was , "" how will she  handle this ? She is going to have to pack my things. ""  Even in death I couldn't be a god damn burden on the  one who means the most to me. 



I've been told a million times, to quit you have to want it. It has to be for you and no one else. I just don't  see it. I do not value my own life the way i imagine other people value their own. I don't WANT to quit, i just feel like it is TIME to quit. This thing has run its course and I really feel like things are about to get a million times worse if I do not change immediately. Oh how i want to do anything but change :/




 I apologize for subjecting you all to this shit show. I really needed to put these thoughts down to see them. I am sorry if its just ramblings, its not a sympathy plea. Just the writings of a guy who is currently high and wishes he was anywhere but here.

A lot of people in my area are using an app where you can post anonymous pictures and posts and view others' posts in your area (yeah I know, location can be traced, but it's essentially anonymous for the non-tech savvy person who doesn't know how to trace others). I was rolling pretty hard with a couple of friends last weekend and posted something along the lines of that. Someone messaged me through the app and asked to hook him up, and I asked him his name and looked him up on FB. I have a few mutuals with him but I don't talk to them anymore, so it'd be weird to ask them to vouch. I agreed to, and he told me to hit him up for anything else, so I asked if he had oxy. He offered to trade me 5 40mg OC's (30 each) and 50$ in exchange for 10 caps of molly.

I figured I'd post about my adventure last night in hopes it might help somebody.

Preface: I live in Memphis which is flooded with dope and is also one of the most dangerous cities in the country. Understand that cold copping is dangerous for numerous reasons, so do not attempt to do this unless you're street savvy enough to not get played or worse.

I used to have plenty of connects in the city, but got clean for a long time and lost touch with them. I know where the major dope track is, but it's so hot over there that I refused to go that route. I do have a cellphone plug, but when I called last night he said it was going to be dry for a day.

Bummed, I went down to the local hood corner store to buy a loose cigarette to calm my nerves. When I was walking in, a guy hit me up for some change so he could get a cigar. I politely declined, explaining that I only had change for the loose one I was getting. When I came out, he asked for the short and I told him no problem. We got to chatting, and he asked me if I wanted any weed. I told him no, I don't smoke, but I would be interested in some boy if he could get a hold of any. I showed him the long healed track I have on my left arm when he asked if I was police. He told me that he could help me out, but we'd have to ride across town to the south part of the city to hit up a trap run by a dude he knows. I agreed letting him know ahead of time, that I wasn't new to the game and that I wasn't handing over shit until I saw the product, but that I'd also toss him a few bucks for the trouble.

Long story short, we rode out there, but they were already closed for the night. I drove him back to the corner store, and tossed him $5 anyway. He said he'd give me a call once he had found some and that was that. This morning I got a call at a quarter til 8 from him saying that his cousin had some and I could meet up with them at a house near the store. Ended up getting a point of some stuff way more fire than what I had been getting, and now have a new plug.

That's how a successful cold cop goes down.",1399477727.0
24yija,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/24yija/day_2_nothing/,18,https://redd.it/24yija,JuicyJay,Day 2. Nothing.,"Well I guess I kind of want to do this as a journal for myself, at least for the first week of sobriety. It may help others, but it just feels good to get everything out. 

For some reason, I can fall asleep at night,  but I wake up at 6 am sharp every single day since I've stopped the dope. In detox it might have been 5am, but either way, I have been getting a solid 5-6 hours of sleep every night. Not ideal, but it is much better than the hell I went through when I cold turkey'd a while ago and didn't sleep for 3 days. I can feel myself returning to normal with each chill I shiver. It's weird, I didn't realize it until now, but the chills that you shake out are what your (or maybe just my) body does when it gets it's dose of dopamine. It used to happen when I was sick and I would use, with one giant shudder, the withdraw effects go away and i feel better. Now it just is happening in much smaller chills. 

I still barely have any energy as expected. I have been living on coffee and fruit. To my surprise, I have a huge appetite. I just want to eat constantly now. Exercise is now on top of my todo list. It really does make you feel 1000 times better, seriously, try it. I haven't done shit to find a counselor or therapist like I've supposed to, but honestly I'm more worried about feeling better right now than anything else. I already have had my first test of will. My sister claimed to have saved a line for yesterday, but she lost it. Of course since she can't drive I had to take her to meet someone (not a dealer, but someone who picked up for her). Yes even she admits she's an asshole and she is supposed to be stopping today so she can pee clean next week. As she and every damn one of us say, this is the last time I swear. We'll see. But either way, I knew she had it, I knew she would probably give me some if I asked, and I knew I could find it if I wanted to. The thing is I didn't. I can not believe I would ever say that, but I did not want it. Not even close. I just told her keep it away from me, I don't want to see it. She did, and I know how it is, so I didn't have a problem driving her to meet her friend. It's not like I can't go get some if I wanted to anyway. It's literally right there. Right down the street. I deleted everything on my phone and changed my number, but I can't forget the few numbers I've seen in my phone so many times because I never bothered to make them a real contact. It's all up to me.

I went to my usual Tuesday night na meeting.  The speaker was super fucking intense. Screaming at the crowd. Asking if we think addiction is funny after telling us how his mom, dad, younger brother, and 2 ex girlfriends all died at the hands of addiction. He was homeless, broke, in jail, basically the most pathetic piece of shit you could imagine, yet here he is telling us how he has 2 years clean. With not 1 person left in his family, kids taken away, record that would make most of us look like petty criminals. He was almost 2 years clean from iv dope and coke. The one thing I took from his speech was his description of his higher power. He described it as that voice that you hear, you know, the one that tells you this is a bad idea, yet you ignore it anyway. He said he got very good at listening to this voice, and that's how he knows he's doing the right thing. It's literally how they portray it in cartoons, you got the devil on one shoulder, the angel on the other. It just depends on which one you choose to listen to.",1399476922.0

I know this is taboo, but fuck I am almost out of meds on exam week and this is seriously helping!!

I originally found a few old blue light reports that plugging increases bioavailability of hydrocodone by a large percent compared to oral. I tried this and it is in fact true. I almost puked after plugging only 15 mg this morning and have a slight euphoria! Usually I would need four orally to achieve any sort of nausea or slight euphoria! I took three 7.5s the first time I tried it and was all blurry eyed and slightly noddy, almost like I had took 6 or more orally.

The main drawback is that you need a lot of liquid to dissolve the pills. I know I should do a CWE to get out the Tylenol then I would need to plug less water, but I guess I am just lazy and it works fine with acetaminophen. I end up microwaving the water to almost boiling just so I can get it to dissolve in 3 syringes worth of water.

Hey don't hate on me I am just trying to make it and figured I should share my secret! Anyways off to take a tiny bump of H to hopefully get me where I wanna be, then I gotta study for my exam in 4 hrs!

Well anyways the greatest thing happened to me! I went to the doctor to get like 500mgs of naltrexone shot into my thigh. Boy oh boy.. Was I in for it! My last dose of heroin in my arm was less than 12 hours ago. Within seconds, faster than a light turning on, a full on, hellish withdrawal began. & Jesus fuck. It was the worst experience of my life. I had to work literally 20 minutes from the time they gave me the vivitrol shot. 

That was not happening.. I text my boss, tell him I ain't coming in, then proceed to freak out walking back & fourth the small room saying ""I'm so cold. I want to go outside. I want to go home. Can we just leave?"" My mom agrees. I can tell she sees the terror in my eyes. My moms helped me kick cold turkey twice & I can see in her face how she feels so bad for me & is so sad I'm feeling so much pain.

Anyways.. It was my own damn fault this happened. I just could not stop using up until the day of the shot. In fact, I stalled for 5 fuckking weeks. I had like 8 appointments in that time I missed or canceled . Just cus I knew I'd have to endure precipitated withdrawal if I didn't get clean beforehand. I felt so bad for my mom.. She's amazing. She is doing everything she can to help me cus I asked for it. & I kept completely fucking up day after day, paycheck after paycheck. It made her fucking sad & so stressed with all the money she's used to help my deadbeat ass. When I finally got that fucking disgusting shit into my thigh, I sat down & prepared. I knew it was gonna happen. Doctors didn't cus I lied.. Yeah, very stupid.. But I just could not let my mom down this time, I felt so bad. So I fucking agreed, gave acceptance to let these fucks jam that thick, horse semen concoction into my thigh. 

For minutes I walked around freaking out. Feeling every withdrawal symptom ever. & it was so bad. I asked for some meds from my doctor. He gave me promethazine, clonidine, seroquel, & a shit ton of clonazepam. Anyways, after we left, me madre dropped me off at my apartment & told me to call her if I need to go to the emergency room. I ran straight to my shower but not before popping some of each pill. I got out. After awhile I felt much better. It's not the 2nd day & I'm doing alright. I'm just getting through minor-ish withdrawals still. 

Does anyone think I'll be feeling okay with the meds? I've never had a benzo for withdrawal before. 

Oh! & fuck guys. I'm clean. After 4 years I am finally clean.. Atleast for this 1 month I can't use opiates. Maybe by the end I won't ever want to again.. I hope so, wish me luck niggas! I got 3 days of work off too so this is perfect to get my withdrawal over with. ",1399454322.0

I went to a local headshop to check out what they had in kratom but I ain't paying $14 for 8 grams of some shit that's probably bunk anyway.

I've been waiting a couple days to hear about some perc 10s and she called today to say she had valium.

So here I am drinking again. I used to really enjoy alcohol but not anymore really. I just end up drunk, fall asleep, wake up feeling like shit, and do it all over again. My wife quit drinking because she was a mess of a drunk and we were a catastrophic mess when drunk together. She's going to end up leaving me if I don't stop too.

Even a few norco 10s would be fantastic right now. A good shot would be fucking amazing.

What's odd though is that his nose will scab up frequently.

The scabs started during his second binge (2-3 months ago, about 5 months before his first binge), they get quite bad.  Initially they would be in his upper cavity, and they would bleed after heavy usage through irritation.  Now they can show up pretty much anywhere in his nose, usually near the ""navel floor"" these days, right at the bottom/opening.

What's odd is that I've been sniffing shit a lot longer than him and I've NEVER had any scabbing issues.  Some of my friends snort religiously as well and don't have any scabbing as a result of usage.

Does anybody else have experience with this?  I want to give him some advice as to what he should do about this, but like I said this never happens to me.  Any thoughts brothers and sisters?",1399409447.0

Over the post few months my gf has been wanting to try opiates like hydrocodone and oxy with me as she sees how much I enjoy them. However she has had this unstoppable nausea with them.

The high kicks in about 30 mins after we swallow the pills, she gets about a solid 20-30 mins of great high before she begins throwing up and has constant nausea that ruins her day.

We've tried some Benadryl, different doses, and different opiates/opioids. I don't think it's the APAP cuz even Diludid made her nauseous. What to do? Any advice would be appreciated.

So I have been in large supply of Dilaudid 8mg tablets and I decided to start shooting them to get the most out of it all.  
My experience with injecting is limited to mainly morphine (MSContin ~100-200mg). I have a **VERY** high tolerance to all opiates and I take a regular oral dose of oxycontin 120mg - 160mg (3 times a day).


As for the dilaudid, I have injected up to 7 x 8mg tablets (56mg at once) and had **NO** rush at all and no high that lasts afterwards, I get nothing at all from it. I've done a lot of reading online and the only info available is people talking about shooting 4-16mg and never really any higher. People are scared of ODing at that dose and im already way past it - this is what scares me a bit. Its almost like my receptors are broken... but i know they aren't because when I did morphine I had a rush, also if I overdo the oxycontin I can feel a bit of a high from it too...   
Any ideas why i cant get a rush from the hydro/dilaudid? I keep pushing the dose up and I don't want to OD, I've had no negative signs from my highest dose - so then I just try a bit higher 24 hours later but still nothing.  
Thanks for reading :)

I have had numerous friends shoot me up with no problems ever, I have great veins and am trying to be confident in the matter. Everything I have read in great detail makes perfect sense except for a few things

I think the safest way to make sure I understand I'm doing everything else correctly is to give a brief summary of what I believe the steps of injecting would be and if someone could advise how accurate and safe my summarization is in terms of a useful instruction towards shooting up my first time alone.

I. Make sure you have all sterilized materials; new needle, alcohol for injection site, new cotton balls, sterilized cooker, make sure surface where readying all other materials is also steril. 
 
II. Place desired amount of Heroin into cooker, using syringe apply 50ml of water to Heroin and then cook concoction until it is free of solid material. (you can remove/use plunger to thoroughly stir mixture but make sure to sterilize/clean before reinserting for future use) 

III. Place necessary amount of cottonball in mixture and suck the Heroin mixture into the syringe. Before attempting at shooting into a vein, make sure that the IV is: clear and free of any non-liquid (i guess you would say?) material. I understand that is the purpose of the cottonball and this was not stated in any guides but I feel double checking this is a necessary step my friend taught me when shooting. Also check the tip of the needle to make sure it is free and clear of any cotton or other materials. THIS was not touched base on in many guides either but my friends advised this can be the cause of cotton fever so another measure I feel is necessary just as an extra precaution.

IV. Use a tourniquet to tie off arm and get the veins to start showing, I'm aware this may not be necessary but clearly is very helpful to the majority of intravenous users. Also, in addition, clenching your first, push-ups, etc to help.

V. Make sure the spot of injection is cleaned and steril before injecting. Place the IV at an angle almost flush with your arm (I understand there are many places to inject but let's make this easy my first time and just only speak in terms of the crease/bend in my left arm, most commonly used spot, as an example to help) and push the needle into vein. Make sure not to push to far to avoid going through a vein. Also, make sure there is not air inside the syringe by flicking it as well as squirting a small amount of the mixture out.

**How are you 100% certain there is NO air in your syringe?**

VI. In order to check to see if you are in the vein, you may slightly and slowly pull BACK on the plunger to see if blood seeps into the mixture, if it does, you are in a vein. Also, it is good to stop half way through to check if your still in the vein so that you do not shoot heroin outside of the vein in the event that the needle came out of your desired vein. Also, another good way of knowing almost immediately if you are missing, is if you feeling burning upon injection and/or pain in general. So, once your confident and clearly have it in your vein you inject (or inject, check vein, and inject the remainder all very slowly and carefully)

**I can tell you right off the bat I'm not comfortable with my summarization on Section VI as I am not certain when checking halfway through the injection, in order to check if it's still in, do you pull back on the plunger yet again before resuming injecting? Also, I understand any burning due to missing is UPON INJECTION, however, if you miss in general would you still feel pain BEFORE injecting? That would be nice, it would be a good way to be certain that if your just simply careful, there is always a way to make sure you will eventually hit without the consequences of jacking up your veins** 

Section 6, although sloppily written, kinda sums up an abrupt ending. You then will either feel happy and good with a nice rush depending on whether or not you hit. 

Anyways, I tried my best I really hope someone can help and elaborate to make me feel a bit more comfortable on this matter.

EDIT: 

I had a few other questions I forgot that didn't quite fit in with my summarization I was hoping someone could also elaborate on;

The questions specifically are; while reading through certain walkthroughs, I have read that you should make sure to inject with the flow of the heart. How do I know how to inject with the flow of the heart? That leaves me clueless. Maybe another dumb question, but I really would rather be safe than sorry

EDIT 2: In regards to injecting towards the 'flow of the heart', how I am now actually seeing it worded is, towards the heart, with the flow of the blood. Is this literally, just meaning simply and physically. injecting inwards towards your heart on any injection site. What confused me was knowing how to tell which way my blood flows.. which I'm sure is some common-sense answer, but I genuinely do not understand that portion.. 
-_-

I have also read it's important NOT to inject into a vein you can feel a pulse in, this however, I only saw one time and it was not elaborated on either. Can someone please answer this for me as well?

Thank you again

I really enjoyed the feeling as I know many of you do too. Thankfully I found it easy to achieve this state with many different opiates through many ROA's.

However when I started shooting dope about 6 months ago I noticed I wasn't nodding the way I used to, the way I liked.

Instead now I either shoot to little and feel good but never lose consciousness, or I shoot what I'm guessing is too much and lose consciousness completely only waking up 30 minutes to an hour later.

I know that sounds dangerous but it's happened to me so many times over the last 6 months I don't worry about it killing me anymore. I do get pissed off though, because when I wake up an hour later my high is almost completely gone which is another perplexing effect. The difference between staying completely awake and out cold for 30+ minutes is a barely noticeable difference in the quantity of dope I'm shooting. It's like theirs a very fine tipping point between Just enough and way too much.

Not once in hundreds and hundreds of shots have I managed to nod peacefully in and out like I used to.

I'm hopping this is somewhat common or at least someone else on here experiences dope this way. However I know everyone's different so there's the chance I'm just weird and will always miss out on the elusive dope nod.

Has anyone else come across this formulation from 40mg ERs?  Googling doesn't give me enough confirmation one way or the other.

Ive read of a lot of close calls, first times,  the last times, loss, frustration, the last times, confusion and rage at dealers, fear of going forward, and  also, the last times.

Ive been using in secret (pills) for maybe like 10 years, and up until recently, VERY heavily.  In moderation (which we all know never lasts) it was great! It helped my anxiety and depression, made me fall back in love with the activities that I still thought about and performed in my head, but could never get motivated or care enough to keep pursuing. Apathy is such a cunt.

It's been really nice seeing the experiences of others, the good and bad, that I can relate too. The greater Seattle area isn't the ""Wild West"" that some of you are used to, getting my DOC'S- to this point- have involved shady, untrustworthy punks that apparently secretly pack a 9mm just so he can rip you off for $175. ""I'll be here if you wanna do something bout it"" is all he said. 

Id given this punk ass probably just around $20k over the last couple years and thats how he wanted to play it out. Didnt even have the balls to tell me what apt he ran into. Plus he knew I was in a hurry and codnt wait for hin to make the pickup and get back to my car. 55 minutez into waiting I try callin him 3 times, to no avail.  5 minutes later I get a message back telli  me to ""take it for a loss, and lose my fucking number""
Fuck I wanna get revenge on him, expecially since I helped bailed his ass outta jail when  hiz parents wouldnt, did all the driving for pickups for him, and STILL couldn't get a GD  break in price. Plus he would occasionally slip forgeries to my friends or I thinking he'd sneak off before we'd notice, or sneak under-strength pills in. Plus, he'd turn this a 10-20 minute round trip drive through Brier or Terrace. Good Lord.

On the other end of the spectrum, there are (most) YOU GUYS! Giving out  advice, tips, borderline medical advice to your fellow mellows. And it just makes me feel better about all the secrets I have to keep up and be strong for others, and manage  smiles that I havent had sincerely felf since HS.

The spectrum of users-addicts and all the different substances we use to weave ourselves blankets of warmth and comfort is astounding. 

But, I should reiterate I don't judge, especially because I have no one around me to talk/enjoy it with, ive rather enjoyed chatting a bit with some of you peopls!

I know that, here in Texas, there are a few state reps strongly pushing for medical marijuana. I'm thinking of writing short letters to them thanking them for their efforts, and giving them some facts about kratom.

They are a bitch that you still deal with months after stopping. My experience this time is completely different. I'm on day 6 no dope and day 4 no bupe.  Usually at this time I can't stop thinking about dope and it leads me to relapse. But this time is different and I believe it's all due to a tip I got while in detox.

We had to attend an aa meeting while in detox. One guys story is what completely changed the way I was going about this whole recovery thing. He told us about when he first got clean his cravings were so bad.  He was going to these na meetings and was amazed that people weren't having cravings at only a month or two clean. So he asked them what they were doing to stop them. He told us that all they did was ask their higher power to remove the cravings from them. So that's what I've been doing. I believe in a god, but I also believe you have all the power. So I started saying/praying that I wouldn't have cravings. This is the only thing I have done differently this time, and at like 4 days with absolutely no opiates (2mg of bupe early in the morning was the last dose I took) I haven't had one craving yet. 

It really was that simple for me. Many times a day I say in my head, I won't have cravings, and I don't want to do dope ever. By saying it in my head so many times a day, I constantly remind myself that I don't in fact want to go through the hell of withdraws ever again.

Been on and off (and on and on and on) for the better part of a decade. I had just gotten a year off subs and everything else when I herniated a disc in my back. I guess most of the time they heal in 4-6 weeks but mine didn't and it has been hellishly painful. 

So my doctor wrote me a script for vicodin (yeah, fuck you too lady). As these things go, I was eventually moved up to 10 mg IR oxys. Yay! I told myself it was gonna be so legit and I was going to use them only PRN and blahblahfuckingblah...well we all know how this story goes. Pretty quick ended up with a script for 140 IR a month but of course it came with a catch - the dreaded pain management ""contract"". 

Being who I am (a dumbass with no willpower at-fucking-all) I end up going through every script in max, 4 days. Well I got called in for a ""random"" UA which I switched out with frozen pee. I **really** thought it would be clean - the only thing I can think is that it come back +for subs. So I do my random UA (last Thursday) and go on my merry way.

Fast forward to this weekend when I call the refill line for refills of my lorazepam and tramadol...usually that shit is called in the next day. But Monday afternoon I get a message ""awarmthing we need you to call  Dr. Fuckface's office please"". And no scripts get called in...next day, no scripts...and today no scripts...

The last thing I want to do is call them. I figure I either A) Pissed dirty B) Need to come in to do a pill count (for the pills which are loooonnng gone) before they will fill anymore scripts C) Hate me and want me to live my life in agony 

I am trying to wait to call them/do anything with them until my script would have legitimately run out. However, that is 3 weeks away. And yeah, I made my own dirty shitty bed and this is my own fault. If anyone feels so inclined to point it out trust me man, no one knows it more than me. 

So I'm currently w-drawing from opiates, benzos and tramadol. I'm not going to try and describe how I feel cause I'm sure you all know. 

I mostly just wanted to get this out because this is the only fucking place in my life where there is the slightest goddam chance anyone will understand.

It's only a retail job but it doesn't matter, it's a start.

And the really great news, the business loan to get my company started went through! I started working on the research / figures / business plan last November and managed to get it finished about 6 weeks ago. Then it was 6 weeks of filling out forms and answering questions for the investment company (it's not a loan in the traditional sense, it's a scheme run by the government that gives out very low interest loans up to £10k for startups that they think are likely to succeed) but at long last, **they said yes!!**  
(Before anyone asks, I'd rather not say what I'll be doing as I post on a local sub with this account, it wouldn't take too much to put the 2 together).

The last 12 months have been pretty awful and the last 6 months have been by far the worst time of my life, but at long last things are starting to improve :)  
I think this is also a good time to bid farewell to all you lovely people. You helped me through a dark period in my life and I'll always be grateful for that, there's some amazing people here that don't get nearly enough praise for what they do.

Missing Member.,"The last I heard from /u/LordGobbletooth was at 5AM CST and he was well on his way back from another redditors place towards our town when i last heard from him. The big issue here is that he was driving my car. I can't drive at the moment, so that is why i let him use the car to pick up some party favors from a mutual redditor-pal.

I'm pretty sure he wasn't attempting to burn us considering we had less than $100 between us. And I also highly doubt he is attempting to steal my car, as if you knew him, you'd know how nervous and antsy he was/is.

As for now his mobile goes straight to V-Mail, while his google voice rings a bit. If you know /u/LordGobbletooth and are able to contact him, please implore him to get back to us or at least pass along any kind of info regarding /u/LordGobbletooth and/or from him, if I can't find/get my car I'll be pretty well-rounded in the ""fucked"" department.",1399728655.0

This friend has an income in excess of $100-150K. I said yes but at that point I wasn't fucking with blues or anything really. The dealer is a delivery service/ referral type of thing but does not deliver to my location. Instead I have to travel to a nearby location that costs some $ in gas and tolls. I offer to give him the # but he says he doesn't deal with drug dealers. So for a while it was nice to have a buddy to pick up with and a place to do it etc. We started off picking up about 5-10 roxies at a time.

As the months pass, his use had increased to about 50 a week and I'm still picking up 5-7 at a time.  He repeatedly refused to take the number. Instead he offered me dinner here or there or some gas or toll $. However, whenever I was getting for myself he didn't offer money under the rationale that I would be traveling anyway to pick up. For a while it's not a big deal since I didn't mind getting some free food, chillen, and it wasn't much of a hassle to get to his place. After a while it did become a drain on my time and resources though to continually pick up with this person and drive or take a train to another city to do the pick up. Keep in mind I had started graduate school and didn't have the time to be on his schedule to keep doing this shit. I communicated this to him but has a dope head he didn't think of other people.

Fast forward another few months and he still refused to do his own pick up. I was picking up 5-10 about once a week and he was picking up about 150.

Then one day when I had told him I could do the pickup, my plans changed and it was inconvenient for me to pick up, my friend went on an angry rant telling me I was fucking him over. He totally did not look at what I was doing as a favor, but as me being his bitch with no respect for my own time/schedule. From this point forward, I realized he had no respect for me whatsoever. He had become an angry irritable dope head.  I added a $5 per pill charge from this point forward. After he became a complete asshole I raised the surcharge to $10 a pill. I told him that the dealer raised price and did not lead on that I was pocketing the extra cash. Additionally, whenever the order was short he insisted that I take the short since I am the one that deals with the drug dealer. I did not accept those terms. 

Recently the order was shorted 2 on an order over 100. I had ordered a total of 3 on the order. He told me that I should take the hit since I know the dealer etc and then the dealer said that he would get me back next time. However my ex-friend acted like it was such a huge burden for him to take a temporary hit and he started yelling at me for no reason. Then about 5 minutes later he tells me that I'm a complete asshole for yelling at him and that maybe when I'm high I forget things. I couldn't help but laugh in my head at the irony of his statement since I was relatively sober and I knew he had cleared at least 8 blues that day. Last week he informed me that it was the ""last pick up and that he's done picking up."" I didn't even respond to that statement since it's probably bullshit. I wonder what his experience will be like cutting down from 10 a day to 0 doing cold turkey. He has no other drug dealer connections and is not the type that's going to go to an addiction clinic.

The only thing that made me keep picking up was the extra $ in my pocket every week. In total, he's probably spent close to 70-80K by my conservative estimates on roxies over the past year. The drugs have really affected his personality and I see how his relationships with all the people around him are deteriorating. In the beginning I used to ask if he's ok etc but he never admitted to a problem and kept telling me and himself that it was all under control.

I'm sharing this with this sub-reddit because I want to know what the community thinks of 1) my behavior in this situation; 2) the behavior of the person that started off as my friend; and 3) whether he will be able to quit cold turkey from a habit of 8-10 a day.

edit: 3: The person who is my ""friend"" decided not to quit this week and did another pick up. I didn't get any benefits per se but I did get my $10/pp fee on a rather large order. I am a happy camper to have a few free guys for myself and some cold hard cash money. Happy Wednesday ppl!",1399697954.0

-the silverware is literally mine and i literally do not even have spoons in my room, i cook my dope in a can when i do.
-she is very insecure.
-she is one of the nastiest chicks I have ever been around/lived with..i'm talking bloody and SKIDMARKED underware (multiple pairs) on the bathroom floor on a daily basis, she belches more than any man i've met, farts like a disgusting man, shes not at a healthy weight.
-im a full time student, shes taking 6 credits at an online community college and works a shittty job.(NOTE: I AM NOT SAYING AGAINST PEOPLE THAT DONT DO THE EDUCATION THING/COMMUNITY COLLEGES/OR WORKING SHIT JOBS
-she knows i used to use, but is a fucking alcoholic herself and talks down on all opiate users to no avail
-she is one of the biggest 2 faced people i know, always talking shit about people like ALL OF THE TIME
-she constantly talks shit on her boyfriend, then when hes around lah lah lah she asks him for anything and everything and expects it
-she has plenty of her own issues to worry about
-shes always late paying rent and utilities to my other roommates father who manages and contacts our landlord by  himself

basically guys im asking for any reccomendations on what i should say to put her in her place, make her feel like a stupid bitch, cause i fucking hate her?

Quality - 7.5/10 Ive been getting this same stamp since January. Its gone through several different batches. It started off kinda weak in Jan, Feb and March it was the strongest dope ive ever had, just a half a bag would get me nice and high. Now its somewhere in between.


Quantity - 10/10 Some of these things have atleast .15 in them. A lot of them go up past the first fold.


Rush - N/A, I havent banged in over 2 years, but even just sniffing these things, i do get a nice feeling in my back and down my legs of that almost wonderful muscle ache/warm water feeling. I would imagine they have a nice rush since i dont normally feel that off other dope when i sniff it.


Legs - 11/10 Holy fuck do these things last long. All the different batches of these things last crazy long and they keep me well for over 24 hours. I suspect there is some other type of long acting opiate in these. Someone I know also said they tested positive for methadone from these bags. Im not sure if i believe him because im not sure if its possible/economic to cut dope with methadone and have it be effective but who knows. Either way these things last forever.

Price - 7/10 These things are $10 all the way up because they come from out of state(Im in the south and these come from Jersey), but the consistent quality/quantity of them makes it well worth it compared to smaller local bags with hit or miss quality. These bags probably weigh out to about 4.5 grams and i got that at $350 and the shit is fire. To get 4.5 grams of my local shit,which sometimes is just as good quality wise and sometimes not so great, I would have had to pay $600-700. So this is def worth the money from where Im at.

Overall - 9/10 These things are fucking great, a little pricey, but i dont mind paying a little extra since the quality/quantity is always there.

As we are walking around he is getting more and more fucked up, he was walking slow as fuck and then whenever we stopped he was doing the dope fein lean.  He is an adderal fein so he popped one of his adds in order to ""sober up"" as he put it..I know not the best idea.  Well anyway, he is all fucked up, but he's coherent and not THAT fucked up looking.  I was surprised how snorting a third of a dub could fuck him up that bad, but he was still not totally out of it.  So after walking around for a while checking out some stores, we decided that we would not go back to my house and he would just hop on the train because it was right there, and my house is like a 20 minute walk back from the train anyway.  So were  are text in back and forth and he still seemed fine.  So late last night at around midnight, he texts me that he OD'd and was in the hospital.  I was shocked and asks did anymore dope or popped anymore bars and he said he didn't, and I believe him.  He said that he got back to his place and his roommates found him curled up under his desk unresponsive and he said they couldn't wake him up so they called an ambulance.  I was in shock because I would have never expected that to happen from how little he did.  He said he didn't take any xanax that day at all, he usually only sells them to get dope and more adderal.  He's prescribed the bars and adderal, but always runs out of his adderal script and buys more from from other people.  I can't believe that shit happened.  I feel he must have a naturally super low tolerance to dope because even my first time doing dope I used about the same amount he did, sure I was puking and nodding but no where OD status.  It's also confusing how it happened so long after I saw him, he wasn't in perfect shape when I was with him, but no where near curling up under a desk and ODing.  I was with him for at least a few hours after he dosed and it had to take him another hour and a half to commute back to his place.  Thankfully, he must be ok since he texted me from the hospital after this happened.  Does anybody know of something similar happening to someone(snorting about .1 of dope and ODing 3.5-4 hours later)?",1399653192.0

I've dealt with fentanyl for a long time, but mainly with the gel patches or IV.  Now I've got these stupid mylan patches (the kind that is just a clear piece of plastic basically) and I have some questions for those that use more often.

1) **Technique** - Any tips on technique? I usually cut a patch into quarters and stick it down against my gums or along the inside of my cheek. The problem being that I sometimes step up from a quarter, to half, to a whole patch and feel nothing.  Sometimes I only use half and it works fine.  

Chewing? Avoid swallowing? Adding bases/acids to gum area before usage to boost absorption?  Anything like that would be helpful.

2) **Rampant Misinformation** - Some claim there is some or all of the opiate in the sticky ""glue"" residue on the skin-side-down part of the patch? I've actually read the mylan .pdf that has a diagram of the patch and the different layers and it still wasn't 100% clear.  It doesn't help that there are tons of forum posts claiming only the residue is viable when others are saying only the plastic patch is active.

3) **Activation/RoA** - How long should a sublingual patch take to work? I thought sublingual methods usually worked pretty quickly but sometimes I don't start feeling it for quite a while (1+ hours).  

Is sublingual the best RoA? It seemed the easiest compared to extraction for buccal use.  It may sound weird but is rectal an option? I couldn't care less what method as long as it works better than what is going on now.

**TL, DR** How do you best go about using these? Is my tolerance just too high for the amount in them or is my technique poor?

Edit: Also, if I have a few and I'm a daily user am I better off just using these as skin patches the ""correct"" way?",1399795550.0

(so almost two weeks between going down from the last time). wake up  on friday i feel even worse but i tough it out at work. i feel like maybe I'm getting dope sick a bit earlier in the day but its hard to tell with this goddamn cold. today i had a day off and slept in all day. woke up at 4pm and hadn't done a hit in 24 hours. woke up completely drenched with really bad dreams. run to bathroom, poop, do a hit. feel better. right now I'm feeling okay except the weird sweatiness but i did two hits today and my eyes are pinned so i blame it on the cold.

now I'm scared what if I'm still sick come wednesday. maybe i should have waited longer to go down again but i honestly felt completely fine until i caught this cold. plus my final exams start next week so id like to feel better like I'm not dying. I've been all sweaty and nasty since my cold got worse. i can't tell if this is because of the cold or from going down on my meth.

 I know that's a pretty optimistic way of looking at it and maybe im giving dealers more credit then they probably deserve and I guess it could just be a dealers way of branding their dope because whenever green dope gets brought up it always seems like its really strong.  And since its not coming in stamp bags dying their wares might be the only way to brand it.

Anyway I began to prep my wash and was nodding a bit here and there.  I had my mt dew can upside down pinched between my legs (I always wait till I get to work and get a few things done before I head to the bathroom for my shot).  So unfortunately I nodded a bit after I had added the water for my wash and the can slipped out and dropped into my pants.  I ended up losing about half of the wash in the process, which brings me to my question.

How much do you guys think is left over after the initial shot when doing blues?  I use a full rig of water for my 3 pills and work it pretty good with a qtip to try to get the most out of that first shot.  Also I boil the (tap) water in the microwave in the hopes of getting it as clean as possible so the water is still pretty warm when I prep my shot.

I simply throw with my friend and he goes and gets it. The third dealer just got popped by the cops and it's just too sketchy going to him anymore. He's on house arrest and to cop from him, you gotta put the money underneath a doormat and then he puts the dope under said mat as well. I would have to believe that the cops are somewhat watching him, and if a cop were to be watching me, it's so insanely obvious that I'm there to buy dope. Why the fuck else would I be putting money underneath a door mat in the middle of the hood!? lol

  The fourth connect that I used today is this really stupid black chick who obviously has never sold drugs in her entire life before. She doesn't know basic shit like how and where to meet in public to buy dope and not look suspicious. Here's an example: A couple weeks ago, I called her to pick some shit up and she told me to meet her at the grocery store. Now, instead of being smart and parking where all the other cars are and blending in, she chooses to be parked all by herself with not a single car around behind the store. How fucking obvious would it be to a cop if he saw me pull up right next to a car in an entirely empty parking lot in the back and then proceed to hop in her car for 5 seconds and jump back out and drive off. She also pulls this bullshit where I am told to meet her at McDonalds and instead of just handing me the dope right there in the parking lot, she always makes me follow her out of the mickey d's and park behind her on a street down the road with no other cars around. I have to follow her, park behind her on a random neighborhood street, get out of my car, stick my hand in the window and then walk back to my car and drive off. If anybody sees this, it's so obvious what's going on. She also always fucking PEELS OFF the second the deal is done in her loud ass chevy suburban type car with a fucked up loud muffler.

But the worst/stupidest thing about her is that I am 99% sure that she doesn't own a scale. She tries to pretend that she has one and tell me on the phone ""Yeah I'm weighing it out right now"" or ""Yep I weighed it already for you and it's exactly .3, I'm positive"". The first 2 times I went to her, it was WAYY over. Like instead of .25, it was .48. Obviously, I wasn't complaining when that happened. But then, the next 5 times I went to her, it was INSANELY short and I got super ripped off. I'm talking like, I gave her $60 for .3 and I end up getting a fucking half point. I'll call her and tell her it's short and her response EVERY FUCKING TIME is ""Oh my bad my bell must have been fucked up when I weighed it"" or something along those lines. 

So, after about the 5th time of getting hella shorted by her, I dropped her as a dealer and ignored any calls/texts from her. Even when I had money and wanted dope and had no other connect, I refused to call her because I knew that I was gonna get shorted by sometimes up to $60 worth of dope. But, about a week ago, she texts me and says ""Hey I got something I want you to try, on me."" Now, of course I'm not going to decline free dope, no matter the amount. She told me that she was gonna have me try .2. So, after waiting in a parking lot for 45 minutes even though she said she'd be there in five minutes every time I'd call her every 10 minutes to see what the fuck always takes her so long (Her response is always, ""My bad I stopped to get gas,"" which I find strange how it takes 40 minutes to pump gas and drive a quarter of a mile down the street from where you claim to be getting gas at), she finally shows up at the mcdonalds and I follow her down the street. I get home and it weighs out to .04-.05. What was the god damn point of giving me free dope if the amount you threw is obviously not enough to get me high? Again, I call her and say that it is short, and actually had a straight up talk with her on the phone. I told her why I stopped going to her and told her how straight up, the dope quality isn't bad. That's not the issue of why I don't go to her anymore. I told her how ridiculous it is that she shorts me as much as she had been doing. I also told her how she technically owes me about a half gram altogether from previous times. She proceeds to say sorry and tell me how she had no idea that it was so short, and how her scale was off.

So today, I met up with a friend and threw $40 with them for them to go to their connect. It is good quality, and it weighed out to be a little bit over. Great! So far so good. But, .2 isn't necessarily enough for me to be content, and I had an extra $20 but unfortunately that connect gave my friend the last of his shit for the day. So, with the $20, I decide to call the girl. I knew I would be taking a big risk, but I had no other option to get dope. 

Now, wouldn't you believe it, but things worked out in MY favor this time! Due to the fact that she is retarded and obviously doesn't own a scale, she proceeds to hand me the dope when I met with her and she says, ""Yep, I weighed it and it's exactly a point"". WRONG! She gave me .2 for $20, my lucky day. 

I guess that the theme of this post is that sometimes it works out in your favor when you have a blatantly retarded drug dealer. Praise the opiate gods today, for they surely were watching over me. lol. I hope ya'll are having a good nod doing like I do!

Governor Christie Allows New Jersey EMT’s To Carry Narcan To Prevent Overdoses

Overdose Prevention Act

Heroin overdose has become such a growing problem in New Jersey that the Governor has asked EMTs to complete a training course in order to save lives from drug poisoning. Governor Chris Christie wanted to offer EMTs the option of using the drug Narcan, a medication that can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose, in order to reduce the number of deaths related to this issue. The Christie administration needed to create a waiver allowing EMTs to use the drug and receive training since it was not covered by state EMT rules. The action was prompted by an epidemic of deaths caused by heroin overdoses in the state of New Jersey.

Heroin Overdose Crisis in New Jersey
The Governor of New Jersey was concerned about the level of heroin abuse in his state after drug-related deaths rose from 1,026 in 2011 to 1,294 in 2012. The increase in heroin overdoses is something that Christie hopes to bring down with the help of first-responders equipped with Narcan. The Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Health and Human Services are working with the Ocean County Prosecutor’s office to provide the medication. An emergency overdose situation can be turned around with the ability to use this drug to reverse the effects of excessive heroin consumption. For first responders to be able to carry and administer this type of medication can mean the difference between life and death for people dealing with dangerous heroin addictions.

Protection to Use Life-Saving Medication
The amount of heroin overdose deaths in New Jersey was an issue especially in Ocean County where they more than doubled within only a year. In 2012 there were reportedly 53 drug overdose deaths followed by a record-breaking 112 overdose deaths most of which were caused by opioids or heroin. After this dramatic increase in overdose deaths, Christie signed into law the Overdose Prevention Act which protects those administering the drug Narcan such as healthcare professionals or pharmacists from any civil, criminal or professional liability. After signing the law, the recent waiver was necessary in order to include EMTs to be protected from liability as well. With EMTs protected by law and properly trained in using Narcan it will be possible for them to save more lives as they are responding to overdose situations.

Up until Governor Christie’s recent actions, EMTs in the state of New Jersey were not allowed to carry or administer Narcan according to the Department of Health’s regulations. The department opted to approve a training course for EMTs to complete in order to allow them access to use the drug on overdose victims. The drug Narcan is also called Naloxone in its generic form and is usually administered through a nasal spray. It works to reverse the effects of opoid overdose by blocking opoids from attaching to opoid receptors in the brain. The medication can be effective at preventing overdose but it depends on how much of the drug the person used and how quickly their body can process the drug. Administering the drug however, can dramatically increase the chance that victims can survive an overdose if EMTs respond quickly and effectively.

Since drug overdoses related to heroin use have reached an all-time high in New Jersey, the new law protecting EMTs and allowing them to use life-saving medications was an important decision for the Governor of the state.

Chronic pain patient. Previously on oxycodone 75-105 mg per day finishing up a one week trial of 40 mg opana ir.

Caffeine and other stimulants I've tried make the pain spike up as if I didn't take my last dosage so I still can't get shit done like clean my apartment regularly or work out. At the end of the week of opana I found mysf having to take oxy for breakthrough pain when I took the opana orally, as if it were a long acting pain reliever and not an instant release. Has anyone experienced this before? What do you do to get energy when you want to be active but still not be in pain? If you use to get high exclusively, what do you do to get shit done and not lose your high I guess?

So I've been using heroin IV for 4 years straight. I cold turkeyed with vivitrol. I'm on day 10 & I haven't felt so happy & different in awhile. I was hopeless before I got that shot. I have no intention of relapse. That shot really does help cravings. I've been mad flirting with every attractive girl I've met. I just feel great & I never thought I'd be able to get clean. Anyone who's hope is diminishing, just know, you'll be happy once you really want it. & being sober isn't bad at all. I highly recommend the vivitrol shot if you're REALLY serious bout sobriety. I used up until the shot & went into precipitated withdrawal. It was intense.. But now that i am finally through the thick & not on any Maintenance really... I feel so excited for my life now. 

A gram & a half a day IV was what I was at. I was so fucked. Lying way too much. I'm just so proud of myself for beginning improving my life. I literally did not think I'd be able to get clean, ever. 


Methadone & suboxone don't work for me. I still feel like I have a problem. Cold turkey was all I could do. If you have the balls & the time, try it. 

Anyways... I love all y'all. I been here awhile & don't know as many newer members.. But I'm hoping some of my homies will chime in. Sherif? Peer pressure?? Kitty cat? Hope y'all are doing good. ",1400014626.0

Once again I have a story of me being completely and totally fucked again because I'm the biggest fucking moron to have ever lived. 

So yesterday these two chicks I have been friends with (one of which I'm super close with and considered her to be a good friend and really close - the other cunt though is someone I have never trusted but only went through her when I absolutely have to because she's sketchy as fuck) so the sketchy one was hitting me up all day (first red flag) asking if I needed anything and she was coming over on my side to grab pills and she wanted to help me out and blah fucking blah so I finally get some cash together (enough for 3 30s - 105.00) and she tells me to meet both of them and everything is good to go (the cool chick and her were together) 

So they pull up and she gets in and says that she has to take my money and go meet the guy at which point I poke my head out to talk to the other girl (my friend) and ask if everything is legit and if I should hand over my cash to her (because I trust the other chick) and she says that yeah, everything is legit, she knows the guy and we'll be right back (second red flag)

So of course, like a fucking moron, I hand over my money and sit and wait. 20min go by... I call her and ask what the fuck is going on and she said she had to run someone down to some townhouses to grab them so just meet her at a nearby gas station. 

So I go to the gas station and wait another 20min. Then call her again and she says that they're on their way back now and to stay there.. So awesome! She didn't rob me.

A FUCKING HOUR GOES BY of me blowing these bitches phones up with texts and calls and they're not fucking answering. Then of course, i'm beginning to look sketchy as fuck and a cop rolls past and asks what I'm doing, I make an excuse then bounce. After leaving both of them messages that I hope 105.00 was worth everything I've done for both of those fucking bitches. 

Needless to say, I'm still fucking livid and am trying to conspire some shit. If it were some drug dealer, it'd be different and I would just let it go but it's two fucking bitches so fuck letting it go.

And I know, I know.. Never let your money walk. I guess in some sense I deserve it but I never would have thought a girl I've looked out for, bought her pills when she was sick, let her borrow money (which I've never gotten back) and looked out for her every single time I've ever grabbed from her. And of course, as a chick, I am hurt but I'm more angry than anything. And last night the chick I'm friends with hit me with some bullshit story about how the pills she got weren't real and the other chick ""was sincerely trying to get your money back"" bullfuckingshit... If that was the case, I wouldn't have been ignored by both of them.

Sorry guys, I just needed to vent.

And then to add salt to the wound, my other dealer drives past me and sees me sitting there and asks what's up? So I tell him and he calls it, they robbed you... And he was good this whole time, lived closer and is cheaper. Fuck my fucking life.",1400006220.0

Some questions for you guys. (that I can't ask the doc),"off topic i just realized how weird the posting page is. dont give away your shit dont ask how to kill yourself and something about intergalactic law....huh..

Anyhow, My fiance and I finally got into a suboxone program. Considering we're in a small town in the middle of nowhere, it was a pretty big deal for us. I'm still on the first week so my doctor is trying to find where my dose will be stabilized at, probably going to end up at 6 or 8 mgs a day. 

I had been on subs before in 2009, and damn shits gotten strict since the last time. councelling is now a mandatory thing, my doc says she'll occasionally call me in for strip counts, only get enough to last me until my next appointment (which is annoying this first week cuz i'm prolly going to be going to the pharmacy every single day). I'm grateful to have this though. I let things get way out of control this time around and havent been able to give enough effort to get back on my feet cuz of this shit.

I want to get a good amount of clean time under my belt before I go dick off again, I dont think i'm going to be done forever. So thats where my questions come from. 

Those of you that take subs and still use occasionally, how do you do it? 
is it worth it? 
Are the subs going to keep my tolerance at a huge level?
Do you save any of your strips for a rainy day?

I know doctors can run an immunoassay ua to monitor drug levels, but with everyones bodys being different I figure they cant be incredibly accurate about what how much and when you put something into your body right? 
Do you think my doc would notice me not taking a few strips to stock up for when this is all over?

My only connect has been having troubles keeping inventory high sort to speak, so I think when I have the extra cash and he has shit I'm just going to go stock up for when I feel I deserve a reward. Just in case he ends up having to stop all together, Because then I'd have to pay 50 a point where i live, if i can even find anything, and thats just not worth it at all. so more questions.

How long can dope stay good for?
How should I store it? 
Would it be worth to stock up like a ball to make last a few months? 
Or is it just going to lose potency and be a waste?

I made a post last week describing my relationship with a person who started off as my ""friend"" but spiraled down into an angry blue-head. He told me last week he was ""done forever picking up"" and was a complete asshole to me. This person has an 8-10 blue per day habit.

Fast forward to this week and he wanted to pick up and called me to do it for him. I increased the fee that I'm charging to $10/pp and it was a rather large order. I am lucky to have an amazing connection, and I am careful not to fuck anything up. About the person who was my ""friend"" - That person can go fuck himself as he's only out for himself, so in my eyes I'm only giving him what he had coming. 

I'm a happy man right now with a fresh pick up and some $$$ in my pocket. A successful night indeed.  There's a lot of scum out there but if you're scum to people, you ARE certain to get it back. This is especially true when you don't have your own hook ups. The game is the game.  ",1400123205.0

I celebrated a year sober from opiates last month, all thanks to my friend suboxone. Now, the only problem with subs, is once you run out, all those old feelings come flooding back. Well, due to my own stupidity, and my doctors lack of a prescription drive thru, I ran out on Friday with no hopes of contacting my doctor. So, I prepared by buying a bottle of lope and sitting back to watch the show. Saturday was fine, went to a party got drunk, and woke up Sunday to go home, and on the car ride home felt the familiar restless legs, and had an oh shit here we go moment. I got home, when full blown withdrawls symptoms set in, as well as a hangover, so, I remained on the couch praying to junkie Jesus, and asking friends to put their ears to the land searching for any opiates. FINALLY today, I heard from a friend, drive out to the middle of bumfuck nowhere Indiana, and got about .7 of some fire for 60 bucks, and the promise that I'd throw the kid a few subs. As we get back in the car, he asked if I liked bars, and I said yeah man, why not. He threw me 5 Xanax bars, for 1 sub, that I didn't even have at the time, just whenever I see him again. I am one happy camper. Gettin ready to hopin the shower after snortin a couple lines while butt ass naked. Ahhhh. There's no better feelin in the world. ",1400119966.0

It was like 9 at night, i do a weird u-turn at the end of the street and park in front of the house to the right where my buddy ran in. Now I'm just sitting there waiting for my buddy run back out and this jeep cherokee or something drives down the street maybe 3 minutes after my buddy ran in.

So this dude turns around the exact same way i did except he turns his brights on behind me. Immediately my fuckin heart is just pounding in my throat. I just snorted a bunch of meth and was kind of weirded out by this. He drives all slow and pulls into the driveway behind me. 

Now i see him walking all weird behind me, staying at an angle where really i could hardly see him, but he could definitely see me. I SWEAR to GOD he was holding his hand underneath his shirt like he had a gun. And this is how he walked up to me. Now i was really fucking scared, he asked what i was doing, i told him my buddy was just running in right there. He goes ok gets in his car and fucking leaves.

Now what the fuck was that!!???! He was obviously checking me out, but this is fucking wyoming lol. ",1400101907.0
