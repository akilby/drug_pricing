I just started IVing a little bit of coke recently, but only have access to 21 gauge needles, which are a bitch to use correctly. I ended up missing a vein a few hours ago and the area around it swelled slightly became numb, and now is mildly painful. I have had one abcess before from re-using old needles like an idiot, and it cost $700 to drain it! I cannot afford this again. 

If I missed, that doesn't necessarily mean I'll get an abcess does it? The swelling and pain just worry me because those were the first symptoms of my abcess this summer. 

So my question is: is there anything I can do to help reduce the chance of an abcess? I heard washing it with soap and warm water helps.

Let's all take a moment to appreciate the good times that our Opiate of Choice has given us.

Back when I was still kind of a noob (only been using a few months doing a few hydrocodones at a time [oxy 30s are what I prefer now, lol]) I was buying from one of the cooks at the Pizza Hut I used to manage. This was in 2011, so about 3 years ago, and I remember the exact date because it was 01/11/11. It was one of those rare snow days we sometimes get where I live, just north of Atlanta, and I decided to brave the icy roads in my shitty, front-wheel-drive Hyundai I was driving at the time. My best friend and I were both taking the day off because of the snow, and I decided to drive all the way to my Pizza Hut to pick up, because what could go better with a snow day than that blissful, euphoric, warming cheer. The drive was sensational (always fun driving to go pick up) and I had to park and hide behind the dumpsters and have the cook come out to meet me because I wasn't supposed to be there. We bought a bulging bag of beautiful white candy  and needless to say the drive back was a thousand times better. Like the white, snowy world was smiling at us. We spent the rest of the day lazily fucking around in the snow and nodding around the neighborhood, and it was one of the best days ever.

Hey guys, I would appreciate any help on these guys. I am pretty positive they are real (reliable source, they look spot on). However I believe that these are some sort of new formula that makes them unable to snort. Although they can be crushed, when they snorted they burn and do not have an overwhelming effect. They seem to be slightly more waxy (like OPs I have had in the past but they do not gum up as much) I normally am pretty high after blowing 1/2 and I have taken up to a full one of these and only felt a little high.

I was previously on MS Contin 30m, so it's not a new experience. 

However, these things are completely kicking my ass! I'm an experienced but in-control opiate ""user"". I also have a fairly high ""functioning"" tolerance, meaning I can handle pretty high doses (e.g. I can fully function on 200MG of IR Oxy and most would be none-the-wiser). I allow myself ONE day out of my prescribed medication to ""enjoy"" it a little, usually the first day I get them. So last night I bit 5 in half (since the oral BA is 40%). I was noticeably ""loopy"" to the point my mother was making jokes about it, since I'm never ""loopy"" from my opiate medication. I even ended up nodding (which I dislike, I love being able to function while feeling better from the ops)!!!. Off of (estimated) only 90MG! I even felt TERRIBLE this morning, the most scared I've ever been after taking opiates, ever. I genuinely considered calling 911 for a few minutes.

I took two (full to keep the ER intact) a few hours ago and it feels like I insufflated 30MG of Opana. I don't understand this at all, and I'm not a noob to pharms. I'm prescribed .5mg of Ativan, but I only take it during a panic attack or if I feel one possibly coming on. So, none of it was nor is in my system. The only medications aside from my ms/norco that I take daily are 5mg prednisone, 100MG Zoloft, & 40mg pantoprazole. I also take Methotrexate once a week, and Remicade every 6 weeks.

Why shooting up is not exaggerated when spoken of as a ""Whole another ball game""","I noticed quite a bit of snorters saying ""it's bullshit,  opiate is an opiate"" 
Each experience is different.  This was mine:
I was using h nose roa for 1.6 year on and off.  I would use 2 weeks out of a month,  stay two weeks off,  sometimes 3 days use 3 days Sober and so on.  In August 2011 I decided it's time for rehab and I finally got the 15k for it (no insurance non American living in US).  Silly me decided since I'm quitting forever I gotto try the needle before I go in.  When I shot up it was like I discovered what heroin is for the first time ever.  I kept postponing my rehab eventually it took a month.  I finally went in.  I was so fucken sick they had to call ER.  
FF 2 weeks I get fed up and leave early. I live in NYC rehab is in NJ.  I walked out with a bag on my back and went to train station.  Right there I for the first time coped from anyone outside of my first and only dealer who delivers only.  Amazing how many people are there to share next to rehab.  I didn't have to pay.  Got on train and some other dudes shared their beer.  
Anywhoo I got home and went straight for the rigs.  I used every day and ""woke up""  in February. My habit great from one bundle a day to 5 a day. I wanted off.  My arms where bruised,  I had no veins,  no BMW z4,  7 month rent debt. I was standing in the bathroom,  covered in blood from head to waist, not able to shoot up.  I kept jamming the needle aimlessly at this point and screaming from frustration.  I finally got it. It was heaven,  Short lives. 
I had to get clean. 
For forever I got clean fine on my own.  I would stop for 12 hours then take a sub,  taper off it.  
So I did just that. I waited 12 hours and dosed.  That was my first precipitated wd.  I have never felt so much pain and fear in my entire fkkn life.  All the opiates got ripped out by force off my neurons in matter of minutes.  I quickly dosed h to counteract it.
FF week later another try,  I waited 17 hours,  same result! 
FF 1 month I have tried this 14 times now.  I waited anywhere from 12 to 40 hours and keep going to shit,  but this time my dealer won't answer,  no dope.  I called ER,  started having seizures.  
Next thing I know I woke up on the floor in rehab 2 days later,  already on methadone.  They shot me up with it in ER to help.
So here I am 3 years later still on fucken methadone,  was 2 years Sober of everything aside from methadone 3 month ago.  Now relapsed again but avoided needles.  Now trying to get back on track. 

Needles steal your mind,  life becomes 100% secondary.  Nothing else matters.  And the sickness is so intense that you ll do anything.

I've seen people do disturbing shit when they wanted to shoot up.  Dude I knew came up to me at a club after my dj gig and goes ""did you just shoot up in the loo?""  I go yeah ""are you clean? No aids or hep C?""  I go yeah why?  ""where is the rig?""  it's in the trash.  He went and got it and shot up... 

I have a hole lot of disturbing stories which are living proof that needle game is a whole another animal and you are no longer the same person once you are on it.",1412235661.0

I have been on Methadone for 2.5 years.  Over last 1.8years I went down from 138 to 11 mg.  
Now 3 months ago I had a teenage sister visit me.  I love her to death, but my family was a reason I became an addict.  I had a normal childhood with good upper class family but...  My mom was quite abusive emotionally and dad just cared less.  I've been on my own in a different country for 10 years now. 
Anywhoo,  my sisters arrival brought all that back.  She kept saying negative things about me,  to make herself feel better (teen coping mechanism),  I wasn't used to that,  took allot to get my self confidence and it crashed fast when the blows came from loved one.  Plus I heard plenty of stories of what trash my mom talks behind my back. 
FF I relapsed.  At first I was just doing one bump in PM when we would be home.  When she left,  2 month later, I cleaned up,  that did not last.  A week later another relapse.  Unfortunately me being alone and not having to hide my use escalated to one bag a day,  then 2 bags a day.  I'm now back to 0.8 a day.  
This time I stuck to nose roa and avoided mainlining.  
I tried just stopping but at any sign of xtreme nausea of wd I do a bump. 

The problem : even thou my use is small,  I am not strong enough to go through wd,  I can't seem to do it and I feel scared I'm slipping back to hell.  
I wanted and still want to switch to suboxone for further slow taper process but now got a dilemma.  How do I do it?  I was planning to stop Methadone at 11 and do heroin for 2 days then wait 24 hours and go on subs. 
Now I feel like I need to up my Methadone dose to get clean of heroin again and then try again but God I don't want to,  it took so damn long to get down and I'm terrified.  I have so many side effects from methadone. 
What to do? 

P. S. You know,  just me writing this out answered my question,  I should follow through with the plan,  stop Methadone,  do h for 2 days,  wait 24 hours and dose subs.  Has anyone done that? Any pointers or advice? I'm a little terrified to tell the least.",1412228220.0

I'm bored every second of every day unless I'm hanging out with my friends or creating or listening to music. which goes hand and hand with drugs or narcotics, my personal favorite opiates. I pop pills like breath mints and snort anything I can get my hands on. A walk in the park can turn into a walk through Disneyland with a handful of oxys. It feels like I hit a game winning, walk off home run, To win the World Series, in game 7 every time a substance enters my bloodstream. I don't mean to glorify this lifestyle but I want you to get a brief grasp on the role these substances have on my bizzare life. My friends say I should slow down, but I just swallowed a handful of Benzos. If I'm feeling slow and tired I can wake my ass up with a healthy dose of adderal. To sleep more Benzos and to feel like I'm on top of the world throw in a handful of roxys.

and then, my longest known connect.

How does the initial onset/rush compare to Heroin?
How are the legs?
Is it more energetic or will I get super sluggish and all ""fuck doing anything"" like with weed?

Also I usually shoot between 1 and 2 bags at a time with junk but obviously the quality always varies and it's always cut like any illegal street drug; does this mean that a full 20mg pill of oxy, being pharmeceutical grade and therefore presumably full strength, will do me about the same since Oxy ranks lower than Diamorphine on the equianalgesic chart?

After a 5-year-wait, my time has  finally come to enter the programme. I am going to get administered **Buprenorphine**, FREE of Charge, every day, in the nearest Hospital of my house. Doesn't matter that I don't have insurance; we have Universal Health Care.


I didn't opt for the programme that lowers your Bupe dose step-by-step so you quit permanently. After some appointments with State Psychologists, *they decided that I must be administered for ever*. (=maintenance approach). They decided that, because they saw that I never could quit, and that my mental health problems contribute to Opiates being a part of my life, just like a Diabetic needs Insuline for ever.


I already had 2 appointments. One with a State psychologist, and one with State doctors to evaluate my condition and decide the dosage they will give me, as well as choose between Subutex (Bupe) or Suboxone (Bupe+Naloxone).

Since I am not an IV user, although I use for 8,5 years now, *they decided to give me **Subutex**.*

That's  fine with me. They told me that I take care of my body perfectly, and that it is very rare to not have any physical damage. The fact that I got signed into a record label and that my new album comes out on December, made them put me on the ""A-List"". 

This is a list with ""quality junkies"" (hate that term), that even though they use HEAVILY, they are working, creating, living, and also (important) have ZERO past problems with the Law.


I PRESSURED them to give me Methadone instead, but they warned me that a surprisingly healthy junkie like me, which happens to be young (I am 28 years of age) is not worth it to take Methadone and risk having hepatic problems. Is this bullshit?


**Question #1**: Does really Methadone have hepatic risks? Or is it an *excuse* to not prescribe it to me??

**Question #2**: Since I am not an IV user, they decided to give me Subutex (yay!). *Does it worth it to take it by insufflation?* I am sure that it will feel better, but will it abandon my body sooner than the sublingual route?

**Question #3**: People that are on Subs, without cheating and using other opiates, of course: Did your apetite rise or did u get even more anorexic???

**Question #4**: Maybe the most important question. **Do you feel 'full'?** Like, do u feel that a strong opiate entered your system and keeps you the feelings of 'opiates'? I know it is a *partial agonist*, but some of us have *Dopamine related* psychiatric problems, and we need an Opiate as a medicine to **Enter** Reality, and NOT **Avoid** Reality...

**Question #5**: Also VERY VERY **IMPORTANT**: *How many hours should I abstain from using H* so that when they'll give me my first dosage I will feel really that the WDs dissapeared *without a EFFING TRACE of precipated wds???* My opinion is more than 24 hours. 
Once I tried after 14 hours, and precipated withdrawals kicked in immediately almost. Hell.

**Question #6**: I am addicted heavily to Flunitrazepam (the infamous 'roofies). Thankfully, I only take 2mg per day. I wanted to ask: How does the combo feel? See next question.

**Question #7**: Does bupe really have a stimulant effect, compared to Heroin? Mind you, I have ZERO experience with Pharms.

------------------------------- 

Also, *ASK ME ANYTHING ABOUT THESE STATE,FREE-OF-CHARGE PROGRAMMES!* 

Feel free to even ask very personal questions.

I will keep u updated. **Good luck to me, and to ALL people that will start Maintenance**.

I did hydrocodone 5 more times that week with doses ranging from 30-60mg often in combination with DPH. Unfortunately my dealer ran out of his prescription and I have been trying to get some opiates ever since, this was about 2 or 3 weeks ago.

I just found someone else who deals with opiates but overprices them big time compared to my last guy. For $20 he's offering 58mg codeine + 36.25mg promethazine in the form of syrup OR 30mg hydrocodone and 25mg promethazine in separate pill form. Which should I go for? I know codeine is very weak so i'm pretty sure the hydrocodone will be the better deal, i'm just wondering how much my tolerance has gone down in these past 2-3 weeks.

Okay, so. Story starts with me cold copping 4 bags off of a corner. I am then walking a few blocks away and someone pulls up next to me in a normal looking suv and shows me his badge and says 'state police, get in the car!' he then proceeds to ask me what I was doing at that house back there, if i was trying to buy pills or dope or coke etc etc. I say I tried to buy xanax but they didn't have any, so I left. All the while he's driving us around and we end up in this empty lot type place. 

He makes me empty the contents of my pockets and things and looks through my wallet and stuff and eventually finds the 4 bags of dope I copped hidden in my hiding place. He's asking assorted questions about who I am etc, what my name is, he at one point makes me go into my phone and stuff and sees a number of someone he thought might matter and takes it down. He then asks if I know of ant drug houses, things like that. I tell him I mostly just know corners and he says he doesn't care he's interested in big things. He also takes down my number and my moms number.

long story short he tells me he's going to call me in a week and we're going to buy some drugs somewhere, otherwise I'll be arrested. He then gives me back 2 of the 4 bags he caught me with and says 'here so you don't have to go home empty handed'

the questions I'm wondering aside from how the fuck is this going to play out are:

1. is he actually going to call me in a week?
2. can he actually arrest me a week later? (took a picture of my license with his iPhone, no real official equipment was used during this ordeal. anything he wrote was on a piece of scrap paper, no official looking documents. he just had a walkie talkie and a badge)

does anyone have any advice or have been in a similar situation?

why would he give me back 2 bags?

I even saw the guy who walks down the main street who looks like he's always on something and I wanted to ask him if he had anything or knew of someone. I don't buy off the streets. I never had. I always go to my dr. I even thought of going to the ER and saying my pain was so bad. I do have degenerative disk disease and I am hurting, but not enough to go to the ER. 


So I'm drinking wine. Almost finished the bottle. I don't normally drink. I like having wine every now and then, but I usually don't drink because I hate the after feeling of it. 


My friends husband went to rehab (twice) for pill addiction and I even thought of asking him if he knew anyone. Shit. I was really trying to wean myself down to the recommended dosage of my norco, but that went south fast. I have soma that I take as prescribed. It gives me a rush first thing in the morning. But not when I take it during the day. I am prescribed 350mg 3x a day. Along wuth my gabapentin. I'm also now on a steroid and antibiotic because the surgery I had a little over a month ago developed a severe infection and isn't healing. Fun times. I didn't get pain meds because I wasn't obviously in that much pain. I don't think pain meds would help the pressure in my sinuses. 


I'm rambling. It's just me here alone. My husband is working and the kids are asleep.

I know this is stupid and reckless, and I will regret it when I'm tapering and going through withdrawals but hey, what the fuck? I'm living life, learning, making mistakes and enjoying myself. My last chance for hedonistic debauchery.

Today I woke up at 2pm with zero opiate tolerance and went to the bar, got given a capri sun and took a sip. Then I reached for the tramadol and etizolam I had in my bag. I swallowed 100mg tramadol and 4mg etizolam, and the rest is history.    

I must have taken at least 10mg etizolam (probably more like 14mg) throughout the day and 300mg tramadol. I could function all day. I was active, close to manic at times (fucking strange), but now I'm just nodding nicely. Keeping my eyes open is difficult but I thought I should advertise and share this cheap recreational combo.    

It's common knowledge opiates and benzos have synergy but even this shitty poor man's nod is fucking great; I'm itching right now and in fucking heaven. Opiates seem really introspective to me (perhaps except oxy), but with the anxiolytic effects of etizolam, it makes it so social. Completely free and completely faded.    

Regarding harm reduction, high tramadol doses can cause seizures, but etizolam is an anti-convulsant so the combo is relatively safe (please correct me if I am wrong) although they are both CNS depressants so care should always be taken when dosing. If you have no tolerance etizolam I would suggest dosing a LOT less.

Anyone else love this combo as a cheap alternative to oxy and xanax or heroin and valium? I'm so euphoric right now, I can't wait to get into bed and just itch.

I'm looking for input on this if anyone else has done it and had good or bad experiences with it. So bear with me here before thinking I'm crazy. I also apologize for the wall of text. I just took my roxy and I'm a little typeative. 

So I was thinking about how I would deal with the 4 days of my meds being short. We all know the usual clonidine, lope, bed rest, tea and benzos/sleep aid routine... But recently my doc put me on meds for ADHD/focus issues like I was in most of highschool and college because I've been having an incredibly hard time staying focused while at work and it's been making my work flow come to a screeching halt and my todo pile stacking up higher and higher. 

Anyways. I was thinking about potentially using the dextroamphetamine as a way to deal with the withdrawals along with loperamide. I realize it doesn't tickle the opiate receptor, but it does release dopamine similarly to opiates and it does cause euphoria, energy, focus and a nice sense of well being. One of the hardest parts of WD for me is the dysphoria, the anxiety/worry/depression, the complete exhaustion and constantly thinking about the next dose. It seems like dexamp would greatly help with the mental issues that arise and a muscle relaxer and lope could help the physical. You'd get a nice boost of euphoria and focus that would (theoretically) get you up and out of bed and not dwell on how much it sucks. 

Obviously a panic attack on it might be a possibility due to the increased anxiety and pulse/bp. You'd also have to be well prepared with benzos for the crash because I imagine that would be pretty harsh. Or never stop dosing but I imagine a tweaking bender wouldn't end well. The muscle tightness could be an issue, especially if you get RLS bad. But hey, another good use for the muscle relaxers/benzos (Especially Valium and Klonopin)

So with proper preparation, having the right assortment of meds to balance out the issue... What do you guys think? Would it help to relieve the symptoms and make a work week of withdrawals tolerable/maybe nonexistent? Have any of you done this before and had good or bad results? 

Please do fill me in, I'm very curious. If this comes off as a really dumb post I'm sorry. I just genuinely don't want to go through this shit again and when you get near it you start thinking in weird ways to do anything you can to prevent that experience. ",1412379161.0

Sorry but I must rant.,"I have a felony from 6 years ago where the actual crime was committed 10 years ago.  Conspiracy to deliver 100 pounds of marijuana.  Conspiracy because they never caught me with anything but a couple of snitches and a grand jury can indict a ham sandwich.

As anyone with a felony know, its basically impossible to get a decent job.  Well I have a pharm tech background.and recently applied to a big chain pharmacy to be a pharm tech.  In the initail application it of course has the dreaded ""have you ever been convicted of a felony"" and of course i check yes.  It was nice they had a little box to explain it though.  Thinking I would never hear back because that little check box usually means ""fuck that app"" I was surprised to see I was scheduled for an interview. 

I nailed the interveiw and the lady was super cool and gave me a tour of the building when we were done.  I've heard you only get the tour if you have had a really good interview.  Things are looking up for once.  I got an offer letter with a start date.  Everything was contingent on passing on drug test and the background check.  

Now the drug test was no problem.. made sure I was clean. And I figured that since they already know I have a felony, why would they go through the trouble of spending money on a drug test and background check if they did not plan on giving me the job.   So my hopes were super high.

Low and behold I get the call today from the super nice recruiter to tell me that she has bad news and am no longer elegible for the job because I failed the background check.  WELL NO SHIT I FAILED IT!! I TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING I HAD A FUCKING FELONY!!!   Why the hell did they waste their time and money on me when they clearly knew I wouldn't pass it....   

I'm so pissed right now.  I wrote and stern email back to the recruiter asking why they put me through this whole process when they knew in the beginning they wouldn't hire me.  It just doesn't make sense.

No judgment, real people. It's usually the first place I check each day when logging on, even if I am a ~~bit~~ of a lurker. 

edit: I was asked to provide a bit more info.

I use a thinner piece of foil. I've tried thicker and I just prefer the thinner type. I fashion a straw out of foil wrapped around a thick pen and then on the smoking end I crimp it a bit so that its more like a long funnel. I light heat the tar (although Apollan gave me the advice to heat more gently so I will focus in that) and then light it run down the foil while inhaling, following with my straw very closely to the blab of tar. One mistake I often make is to dip my straw into the junk. No biggie I just get a paper clip and pull what I can (which is most) back out to the foil. I stop heating a bit before I quit inhaling. That was a big aha in terms of avoiding wastage. 

So those are the basics. Now that I think about it, given all your kind responses, I think I am about an intermediate in terms of skill level. There is probably a lot more I can learn though so please keep your advice coming, I am learning a lot. ",1412496706.0

Also a weird story.,"So my friends girlfriend is quitting dope tomorrow. She is my only connection to being able to get dope. If I wanted to, she said that her dealer would take me on if I liked, but I said no. I'm trying to use this as an opportunity to stop doing dope for a while. As most of you probably already know, I'm a chipper. I snort #4 once every 3-4 days, sometimes if I'm lucky once ever other day, but that's very rare. In the last 6 or so months (maybe even longer than that), I've only been able to actually do dope on back to back days MAYBE 3 times. Financially, I just can't afford to do it more often. I only get money once every 3-4 days, anywhere in between $40-$60, but almost always only $40. So it's not like I'm going to be dopesick now that I'm quitting starting tomorrow, but the mental addiction and cravings are still very real. Obviously it's going to be tough not being able to get high on dope like I'm used to doing 2-3 times per week, but it's something that I gotta do. So although I don't get sick, it's still obviously a good idea to try to stop doing dope altogether, both for financial, mental health, career and quality of life related reasons. Regardless of whether or not there's a physical addiction, it's never healthy to do dope, regardless of how often. I hate how when I do get lucky to get money here and there, it automatically goes to dope. I don't even smoke weed anymore because I never have the money to buy it. My plan now is just to smoke a lot of weed like I used to, keeping my desire to get high at bay with good ol' THC. 

So, today was (hopefully) the last day that I'll be doing dope for a while. Usually people quit doing dope because it's ruining their life, such as leading them to be homeless, arrested, or having to degrade themselves for money. My situation isn't like that. Doing dope just creates unfortunate situations where I can never do anything like go to comedy shoes or buy things that I want. What's also weird is that when people quit, their mindset is usually along the lines of ""I never want to do it again! It's ruined my life! I hate heroin!"" But again that's not the case for me. I would still like to be able to get high on dope here and there, maybe once a month or something like that. But if I am able to never do dope again, obviously I'd be more happy with that outcome. It's definitely going to feel strange not ever doing dope. Hopefully being opiate free will take away a lot of my depression and overall poor mental state. The longest I've gone without doing dope since I became an addict at 17 (I'm 19.5 years old now) is 10 days. I'm curious to see what effects opiate sobriety will have on me, hopefully all being positive. Wish my luck guys, I'm gonna need it to completely get rid of all my cravings.

So today I managed to scrounge up $50, and I threw in with my friends girlfriend and actually didn't get shorted this time. At least it seemed that way. I was supposed to get .25 for $50. The bag wsa probably a little bit less than that, but it was still decently sized enough to where I was content with what I got. It's decent enough dope that it allows the dealer to slightly short his customers but their O.K with it because it's good enough to where they don't have to do as much as they normally do, making it last just as long as a slightly larger amount of lesser quality dope would. I am now sitting here, 

Oh, and the weird story that I alluded to in the title was that so when the girl called up dude to get the dope, he told her ""I'm not going to be doing this much longer, just letting you know."" When she asked why, he began crying/sobbing over the phone, only saying ""My friend just died from this dope."" Woah... a dealer with actual feelings and emotions? That's a rarity in this line of work. I don't mean to joke at the expense of somebody else's life, but I'm sure that all you people out here would agree with me when I say that being exposed to real emotions from a dealer is very uncommon, unless you're friends with your dealer. The dope was COMPLETELY WHITE. [Here's](https://www.anonimg.com/img/afec6ed73148c6cc741f422d4e71f3ec.jpg) a picture of it. It made me nervous that it was fent dope, but the girl had already done her shot and wasn't dead so I did mine assuming that I'd be fine. Turns out that it's just decent quality dope that happens to be white. I didn't get some crazy rush when I snorted it like fent dope would do. It has legs as well, so obviously if it was fent dope, it wouldn't be lasting like it is, as I'm still high 4 hours later. But still, it was definitely a very weird feeling knowing that I was currently doing dope that just killed somebody either yesterday or today. I also took 275mg of diphenhydramine (11 benadryl pills). Yes I know that's a lot of benadryl, but I seem to have somewhat of a tolerance to it and all it does is make me feel tired, causing me to nod more than I normally would without it. 

Welp, wish me luck guys. Hopefully from here on out I can just be content to only smoke weed. But don't worry by friends, I'll still be on here every day posting daily. I'm not going anywhere :). I hope y'all are having a good night. Do a shot, line, or whatever your ROA is for me!",1412486477.0

So..if I was to choose an opiate to get back into the game with, and an ROA, what would it be? I dont want to IV. If I get tar, obviously I would just smoke it. But what if I find Oxy/morphine/D's?

Right now i've successfully maneuvered my way around the dope scene here.  What I want to find out though,  is finding a Mexican dealer a better option?  

At the moment im either dealing with street kids that are trying to maintain their own habit by shorting bags (.05 is  apparently .1) or wanting $10 a point all day long.  Another route I've found is,  people who have shit weighed,  its always on point, theyre respectable, willing to front you yet quality isnt top notch(isnt bad either) nor are they ever on time, also they do shit on the street which is bothersome.  I work in public environment where people know and recognize me.   Also I dont at all look like a dopehead. I dress pretty well,  I hold myself in a rather respectable manner,  basically nobody knows by looking at me,  nor do people figure it out.  I dont want to change that.   

If anybody wants to chime in on their experience with Mexican dealers?  Would I basically just be going to the ""source"" instead of dealing with street bullshit?  Better pricing(I know pricing changes everywhere you go,  some basic examples would be cool.),  Right now i'm paying $40 a half g..

If you looked at me or was even some what of a close acquaintance you'd never know I dabble in Opiate use.   I'm the quote unquote health guru amongst my friends.  I'm an avid gym bunny and participate in obstacle coarse style events.  I'm that guy.  What people don't know is if I see a bottle in your medicine cabinet I'm stealing it.  It can be a bottle of tylonal 3s I'm taking them anyways. I've limited my benders so to say for the weekends.  I've done this for the better part of a decade.   I've slowed down considerably to the point of a bland sobriety.  

The family thinking I'm the most respectable of the bunch have charged me with keeping an eye on my elderly grand mother.  Like most old people her home is covered in a candy land of various pharmaceutical delights.  I've been an upstanding member of society and not taken a single pill, powder, liquid or whatever happens to be crammed in every other cabinet.  

That all changed this weekend.  I was ask to spend the weekend at her place because no one would be able to check in.  Seemed fine enough.  Friday post gym I plopted my self on her couch and popped a couple norcos.  Nothing by this reddits standards.   

Saturday rolled around and I started to rummage through the fridge in the garage.  Then I seen it.  In the cheese and lunch meat drawer was a small brown paper bag with a crudely drawn cross bone and skull on it.  Ahh, but the most exciting was the sharpie RX below the skull, probably drawn by my aunt.   

Inside was a small pink eye dropper.  After closer inspection a glow of christmas radiance shimmered on the plastic container.  Morphine Sulfate.  All rational went out the window.  I downed several drops and immediately felt a comforting wave that I rarely encounter from my use.  
 
Later in the night I end up consuming about half the bottle.  I was sloppy as fuck staggering around her home and even later going for an 11o clock stroll through her gated community.  

At the peak of my blissful delirium I get a string of upset text messages from a gay fling I'd been having.  He wanted to meet up and he was in love or some shit.  Too stoned to bother to accept the call I sunk into the warm arm chair and proceed to win another round of hearth stone. All was one with the universe. 

Ohh look at that another text, I wounder what he has to say now.  ""I will make you feel so good I'm out side your place right now""  Fuck! not here. I half spring to my feet expecting to have my normal level of agility.   I drunkenly reach into my back pack and remove my telescoping police baton.  I rip my shirt off and rush to the front of the house and swing the one side of the double doors open.  Standing in the stone walk way I shout out I will beat you within an inch of your life.  There's no one and the neighbor hood is silent.  I make eye contact with the old man who lives across the street.  Standing there, no shirt, stoned out of my gord, holding a metal baton it came to me.  

Like a bucket of ice water had been dumped on my head I realized I wasn't at my house and certainly no one I knew had the gate code to my grandmothers community.   

Thank god grandma didn't see me sloppy on stolen meds and didn't meet my gay lover.

First of all, I mean this post to satisfy my curiosity, not to be judgy. 

I have a brother who is a heroin addict. He began snorting 30mg blue roxis in the summer of 2010. This was at the same time as the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. My brother received ~$35k from BP as a settlement for the potential loss of income from the oil spill as he worked at a private golf course. Anyway, he stuck at least $30k of it up his nose and developed a $100+ a day habit in about a year.

My parents helped get him into a suboxyn clinic, but that didn't last for too long. He has since moved on to heroin. Since then he has stolen $50k + from my parents via stolen checks and credit cards. He also stole and sold about $30k-$40k worth silver ingots, gold, and antique bills that were 3rd generation family heirlooms.

I don't really know how much certain pills or heroin costs or how much he used, but it seemed to me that he had a pretty substantial habit and he hasn't really been a functional person in nearly 2 years. 

So my question is, although people surely have varying degrees of use, how do you guys afford this habit?

Again, I'm not trying to be judgy or accusatory, but I'm just trying to have some insight into all of this.",1412559013.0

After continued pain the doctor kept prescribing Percocet but kept it at the same MG and qty. he continued to write the scripts every 2-3 days for months while trying to fix the problem. Fast forward a few months and I had to move to a new city in the middle of Kansas far removed from where I came from. I am living in an incredible amount of pain and am fairly certain I am withdrawing hard and now struggling to care for my kids because I can barely stand the pain and the lethargic mood. Went to the ER and was given 10 norcos which were gone that night cuz they weren't even touching the pain. The new doctor refuses to give me pain medication and says it's only a bandage but he can't seem to find out what truly is wrong with me. I just spent the entire morning reading through this subreddit and feel that a lot of you can feel my pain here. I appreciate the chance to vent to people who I feel aren't going to label me an outcast and can understand where I'm coming from.

This crazy freaky dream forced me to wake up at 3am. I woke up to pretty harsh chest pain. I think it's partially from the dream, but definitely mostly from smoking as much as I did last night.

So, to make my transition to sleep easier, I popped 3 100mg ER morphines. They're extended release so I usually don't feel em til a few hrs in, and the peak about 5-6 hours in. 

My question is this: considering I was asleep for the first few hours, will that trump any high I may have gotten, whether while I was sleeping or after? Or does the medicine play out the same, such that if I woke up two hours after I'd feel it and if I went back to sleep and woke up three hours after *that* would I be at the peak?

Essentially I'm curious on the effect sleep has on an opiate high, particularly morphine, particularly 100mg morphine ER pills taken orally. Anyone ever wake up high?

Btw I kind of feel something, but I'm the first to dismiss things as placebo, I'm the type who needs to feel it 100% to know its the drug.

Get ready and strap in because this is going to be relatively long. I've been a long time redditor however always a lurker. However, I recently discovered this magical sub. I created this ""throwaway"" for sake of this post however I'm realizing I would prefer to have this be my main. Can't run from who ya are amiright? (I can hide from my irl friends through a monitor and trickery though)
I have been an opi user for about 5 years. Started in college with blues yadda yadda on and off yadda yadda. I decided to put my education on pause and pursue a career in construction. Throughout college, during all my breaks and the one of two semester i took a temp leave I began working with a very small construction business that worked on very high end jobs. Eventually this business grew from myself and the 2 owners to about 15 employees. 
I decided to strictly focus on this trade about 2 years ago. Throughout my employment I began by not knowing which end of the broom to sweep up site with, to eventually become a site supervisor as well as a master carpenter(along with fairly skilled in just about any other trade that factors into construction). I would never even think of regretting my choices because now I could just about build my dream house from the ground up, whenever that may be. 
Now this is where the inevitable negatives begin to rear their ugly stupiid stinky f***ed up little faces. During the aggressive growth of our company being a 19 year old in NYC with no social life other than my 2 bosses, 25 and 29, and all my old friends residing at college, or in my hometown an hour into the suburbs, I was kind of lonely. Also, what I at the time thought of as a strength, but i am slowly learning is a weakness, I very very often put my friends best interest in front of mine. So, naturally I slowly began to employee my friends on their breaks from school. (names obviously changed for everyones sake) First was my best friend from HS Nate. Next was a decent friend of my Jake, who, remember this because it is important later, was in the armed services, but was eventually discharged because he was: his words ""honest about his drug use"" however we all knew that he was addicted to heroin during his training. Fine with me I don't judge we all have our problems even though at the time to me that was the worst of the worst addictions. He clean no problems everyone deserves a second chance especially those that mean something to me. 
Nate and JAke were working out well for temporary employees. Older boss just wanted them kept out of his way because they were very inecperienced so that was my responsibility. No problem lets just make sure you stay on your task. Younger boss loved the social aspects that we brought because work was work but playtime in NYC nightlife was playtime and we knew how to rip it up. 
The three of us came and went throughout our breaks and it was all fine and dandy while the business thrived while our projects became more renowned, larger, highend, etc. We were started to make a name for ourselves as a business in NYC. The beauty of our business was as long as we got our work done, everyone, and I mean everyone could do basically whatever the hell we wanted to do. Much weed was smoked, many beers were drank, much coke was blown, and many steroids were used(by and far and most efficient and strongest summer we had as a company). This was all done both on and off the clock. Our full-time employees were a plethora of nationalities. Literally my friends, the owners and I being the only whiteys and we all got along better than a family.
Then i moved to Brooklyn with the youngest boss and another employee after pausing my education fulltime. Enter my ""friend"" Bart. This kid was mad annoying but was a part of our group in high school so he was ""our"" jitbag. Now unlike my other friends, I did not ask for Bart to come to the city, nor did I ask for him to become part of the team. He came to visit and kind of just never left. At this time I was clean however I was never one to turn down an oppurtunity to pick up(because i am always the one sharing yet never being shared with) and have a good time. I could tell that something was a little different with good old fat and jolly Bart. He was even fatter, lazier, and jollier that he used to be. However somedays he was miserable. This is the cycle of highs and lows that I have since become SO accustom to.
One night the team which included my two other roommates all went out but I decided to stay in, get UBER stoned and watch netflix seeing as we had just worked like a 60 hour week. So about an hour after everyone left I hear a knock on the door. ""WTF"" in my head, ""it can't be the guys they have a key."" It was Bart all on his lonesome. He stumbles in clearly drunk and just breaks out these glassine bags. And that is when I fell in love with H. 
A few months passed with me less than chipping.Everyone, most importantly the bosses got tired of Bart and it was time for him to get out and move on. He did this and continued to destroy everything he touched. Now I had been waiting for about a half year for the right time to bring in my best friend at the time who I knew could actually make a career out of this. He had a light background in construction and knew that this was what he would be doing for the rest of his career. I convinced the bosses to bring Marsh in full-time and they instantly saw what I had seen. He was a permanent part of the team and he moved in with me. This was about Feb. 2013. Bart had came back for a visit for the weekend and Bart caught us doing some H. Marsh was actually the one to introduce me to maryjane as well as coke so hes no prude yet he was not a fan of opiates. He was, however very upset that we felt we had to hide from him and this was when Marsh fell in love with H.
Marsh and I continued to work our asses off and kept our use in complete check. It turned out that in the beginning at least, it was better that we had each other to keep one another in check. Unfortunately, as summer rolled around, everyone could tell that the large restaurant that had been published already was wrapping up and there would be a lull in the work. Knowing that there were actually adults with families to support, and with the fact that I had learned so much of the traddes, along with so much about how this type of business worked, I convinced Marsh that we should head out of the city and attempt to fire up our own company back in NJ. So that we did. And it went GREAT for the summer. We each had a very rich beautiful girl on our side and we were one of the best landscaping/minor construction companies in Marsh's hometown. We had partnerships and people working for us in what seemed like no time. This is when our chipping turned into a full blown habit. 
While we were back home, we were looking forward to all our friends coming back from school, I'll be honest, to hang with them, but mostly to show off how well off we were as 22 year olds with our own business and all. Hmmmm odd. Nobody has seem Nate, or Jake. Yea this is weird. By now they would have gotten in touch with me to try to get their job back in the city by now. Turned out they had went over my head to the older boss(oh yea who happens to be my first cousin) and gotten jobs in the city. Wow. Weird. Oh well it was our choice to leave and were doing fine. By this point Bart had gotten caught stealing and been outted to our group as having a huge H problem. As the summer went on my usage went up and down but I was always working. As the summer wound down it became evident that as the landscaping work dried up it would be increasingly difficult to keep our business afloat so we decided to see if our positions were available in the city. We were reeceiving no answer and everyone was acting vry shading towards us. At this same time the girl I was in love in was acting shady as well. We then found out that after Bart was outed, he rolled on us ""to take some pressure off himself."" He told Nate and Jake about our use which caused them to ""worry"" about us. Nate was just heartbroken and genuinely upset however it turns out the first thing that Jake did was immediately tell our bosses. He saw his oppurtunity to lock up his job(THAT I HAD GOT HIM) and seized it. We decided to show up on site after being clean for a bit of time and defended ourselves. Luckily we had the skill and a much stronger bond with the bosses than Jake and Nate did so after much time of us struggling financially we finally got our jobs back and got our own place together. After much fighting with my girl I lost her but that was probably for the best in the long run as she had many problems on her own. Marsh and I bounced around a few times and our habit turned into addiction and slowly began effecting our work. Our relationship with our bosses was never the same(except for my cousin and I. We've always been extremely tight and that will never change).
I will start to wrap this up now if anyone is even still reading I greatly appreciate it.
After we worked on site for a few months I was ""promoted"" to independant contracctor. I was no longer hourly and strictly paid(much better at first) by the job, albeit shitty and small. As Marsh and I completed these they slowly dried up and we ran out of work. We were struggling financially and if anyone has lived in NYC its hard enough to survive paying rent, let alone with an H habit. I started to begin to realize it was  time that I start to look out for myself first and foremost. 
I decided to peace out of the city that I was quickly growing tired of anyway. I moved back home because my parents had just had a few tenants leave some houses that they own and they left them in complete and utter shambles. GREAT! an oppurtunity to show my parents that my choice to pause education was the right one because no one will ever be able to take away what I learned! I worked and fixed up our rental properties all alone. I gave Marsh a couple days work and even brought Nate in to paint(his speciality) a few things. I was just grateful that him and I were on decent terms. Marsh understood that our time our running amuck on the streets of brooklyn together was over and we needed to part ways to get healthy again.
My parents were extremely impressed with my work and were glad I was home and ""healthy."" I continued/continue to use daily and see myself as a functional user. I enrolled in night classes this semester and am crushing them. I have been searching for a full-time job in my area and think that I finally found one today! I really hope so because I'm so tired of this part-time bull shit. My parents are happy with me at the moment which is very important to me however my friend department is lacking. They all know that I was having issues however everyone thinks, or at least know I said at one point that it wasn't a problem anymore.
I have gotten over Jake because I know it does nothing positive for me to let it affect me. I guess the main reason I am posting this is because I thought it would feel good to get it out(which it did much more than I ever thought it would). Also because I am looking for any tips on people that are employed full time and are functioning users. Lastly this is my coming out to r/opiates party. I know you will all welcome me with open arms and I greatly look forward to you all accepting me with open arms which I know you will. I LOVE NEW FRIENDS! Thank you for anyone that actually read this all!

I tell this story as a warning; when playing this game, trust you and only you.

I'll Begin:

After a full day waiting to cop (the worst kind of waiting,when you have the cash, and your guy says ""I'll call you in a bit"", hour goes by, you call him, and he replies ""Almost ready, call you in a bit"" and the cyclical agony goes on until he is indeed ready), my dude finally calls me right after the sun goes down, and I drive and meet him at McDonalds. Im picking up .5 of some ECP, and though sometimes it varies, generally his stuff is on point, and well worth the purchase. Recently, the stuff I had been getting from him was white, which I was not used to, but it was pretty solid so I had no complaints (because as long as it gets it's job done, who cares what the fuck color it is, right?). So after I grab the stuff, I drive about 5 minutes and stop in a Publix parking lot to fix up. As I said before, it was just after sundown when I finally copped, and I hadn't had anything all day, so needless to say I was a bit antsy. As I'm opening the bag, I see the white rocks, and figure it to be the same stuff I had been getting for the past couple weeks. I have been dealing with this one guy for 2-3 years, and he has never done me wrong before. Though he doesn't keep the goods on himself, and rather goes to get it when I need anything more than a couple bags, he is always reliable and whoever he gets it from, as I said earlier, always provides solid product. So as I'm dropping a couple of these rocks into the water, I notice not only is the smell rather ""acidy"", but it is dissolving unusually quick in the water. I went ahead and gave my dude a call and asked him if he had accidentally given me coke, to which he adamantly replied no, and that he was 100% sure it was H. I had gotten ECP that smelled pretty damn ""acidy"" before, so that wasn't all that crazy to me. I have seen ECP dissolve pretty damn fast before, so that wasn't that crazy to me. But what DID throw me for a loop, was the fact that it made my tongue a wee bit numb when I put a bit up to it. Convinced I had been given the wrong thing, I called him back and repeated my question. Yet again, he assured me that was just something in the cut, and that this was quite good stuff, only a little different from what I had been getting for the past couple weeks. Like I said, after 2 1/2 years of doing business with this guy I have never been jipped, ripped off, given the wrong bag, or for that matter had anything wrong or discouraging done to me by him.....ever. So, it was dark (therefore I couldn't examine the rocks as closely as I normally would have, in which case I think I would have picked up on what I am about to share), and I had been waiting all day and was feeling a bit 'funny', so I loaded up a nice big shot and put the seat back, and tied off. Now, my tolerance for H is much, MUCH higher than my tolerance for coke, which I rarely if ever do any of, so I am very sensitive to it's effects. The second that plunger hit the bottom of the rig, I felt as if though I was Jonah Hill in 'Get him to the Greek"" during the scene where he gets jabbed with the adrenaline needle. I mean this, when I say that I have never been, off of any substance, so insanely sacked out of my mind. Naturally, I began freaking the hell out, and had to get out of my car and pace, quite quickly, up one of the parking rows at public shopping center (this didn't draw any looks or anything). I felt my heart skipping, and I began to get tunnel vision and feel lightheaded, and immediately had a shortened of breath. I was certain that this was the end, and that I would be leaving this earth because of a dumbs mistake here in a Publix parking lot. I need to, one last time, emphasize how, ridiculously, insanely, unbelievably, tripped out I was on this stuff, because this was also, on top of being a huge amount in one shot, some very high quality coke. For those of you whom have ever shot coke; you know what that rush feels like, and if you do it frequently you also know how close to death you can feel and how thin of a line it is between having an amazing time and an ambulance ride. 

Somehow, by the grace of God (not extremely religious, but there were some prayers being said during that experience), I felt myself coming down a bit after a solid 5 minutes of hell. Once I could talk without chattering or clenching my jaw, I called my dude and absolutely ripped him a new one. I mean I went off on him in full screams, trying to get the point across to him that not only did he almost kill me, but that I checked with him twice about it and he never even entertained the possibility that he could have given me the wrong bag. Yet, I still take full responsibility for my actions during this episode. I should have gone with my gut and not done it, or at least sniffed some of it first, but I was too damn antsy to get loaded and it almost killed me. He ended up talking to his dude who gave him the wrong bag, and went and grabbed me a full g instead of .5 for the same price (and he let me keep the blow). So all, moral of the story is as I said in the title, trust NO ONE but yourself in this mess of a game, because it's rare that the kind of luck I had on my side is on everyone's side in situations such as these.

A little more detail - in my opinion I feel like i would be more sharp, more outgoing, less moody, nicer to friends and family, and have a much better memory. When i'm sober, if i didn't do drugs. 

But sometimes, I feel the opposite - as if I've used so many drugs, and i'm living proof that is not an outcome. When i'm high on opiates I am all these things i mentioned above. I've lived life perfect, jut got a college degree and top 10 sought after corporate job. Maybe not exactly what I want to do. But h does help me get work done, and weed  helps me relax after a long day at work.

A little background about my drug use - tried most of them, use weed daily 6 years, opiates few times a week for a couple years, adderall maybe once every other week. 

I'm just wondering if you guys think this effects your brain, who you are, personality, smarts, memory, and if it has any long term damage to a person. ",1412652972.0

Any advice, suggestions or comments would be helpful and appreciated.","So I am beyond sick of this lifestyle and being a slave to this awful(and awesome) drug we call heroin.  I was really bad before, got arrested, was clean for over a year then broke some ribs got some vics and before I knew it was shooting up dope again.  Since then I haven't gone more than a week or 2 without using.  I've made multiple attempts to quit but they were usually half assed or only because I ran out of money.  I always said, if I just had enough money I would be able to, I'd buy a ton of weed and xanax and order some gabapentin and I'd get through it.  Well, last night I came into a few hundred dollars and after buying a bunch of dope, gave some money to this girl who fills her script for bars tomorrow so I wouldn't spend it and happened to mention gabapentin and it turns out not only can she get it but she has a stockpile of it she never uses!  Gave me 60 of them for free along with like 25 flexeril!  And because she wants me to quit and doesn't know anyone willing to pay for these anyway, she gave them all for free!  Granted it's not like they are worth much but I reallly appreciated that she did that.  Gonna get bars dropped off here tomorrow afternoon too.  She was just happy I was giving her money in advance as she had none at all until she filled her script and made some sales.  So it was win win I guess.  So now I have a ton of gabapentin, a ton of muscle relaxers in the form of flexeril, and like 20 bars being delivered tomorrow afternoon.  And I still have some dope and some money!  

So here's my plan.  Since I work tomorrow through saturday, I am going to do dope for the next few days and not touch the pills I have.  I have never taken the gabapentin before but from what I understand it does help a lot but tolerance goes up very fast.  So just in case I need to take a lot, I want my tolerance to be as low as possible.  So I am going to get a bit more dope after I get a little bit more money and I plan on doing the last bit of dope friday afternoon, maybe like 1pm.  Will be able to work friday night and fall asleep no problem.  By saturday I'm going to start feeling really shitty but I figure with the help of some of these pills I will be able to make it through work that night.  Then, by the time I get out and the w/d is bad, I will be able to load up on whatever I want and be fucked up on that stuff and sleep as much as possible until tuesday or wed when I work again.  Figure by then, the worst of it will be over.  I know I will be super lethargic and depressed but I'm going to hopefully find some adderall in combination with xanax/gaba to get some energy but still keep the edge off.  By the time the xanax runs out it should be all but done and then I get paid next friday so I will celebrate by getting myself a decent amount of weed and then be able to have money in my pocket, get nice and stoned and finally feel like a decent person instead of a shithead for the first time in a while.  

Anyone see anything wrong with my plan?  Have any advice?  Helpful words/good wishes?  I do love this sub and plan on coming here still unless it really bothers me but I doubt it will.  For some reason when I'm in w/d I com on here way more than when I'm high anyway so I'm sure whenever I'm not sleeping I'll be in here while I'm hurting anyway.  Anyway, I really hope this shit works, I want so badly to be done and to be able to say that I am clean and not be lying. To be broke until payday and have it not be the end of the world.  Like when other people are broke, they are just like well this sucks. I forget what that's like at this point.  When I'm broke now it *is* the end of the world, or at least it feels like it.  Think of any possible excuse for someone to spot me some money.  I want to be able to be broke again without being in physical pain and extreme discomfort.

I was really disappointed. I know that the oral bioavailability is really low with morphine, about 30%.

I have had nothing since, and am withdrawing like crazy. Is this from the sub or the dope? I'm praying that the week break I had off the sub and the relatively short period of time I was on them was enough to flush them out, and this is just H w/d.

Experienced opi user of 5ish years here. Started with pills, moved on to dope about a year ago. Started off light snorting some ECP, got a bad habit over winter, slowed down in spring, habit went back up(1.5g of ECP a day usually, shot), slowed down, now i'm back to using quite a bit. I went through WD's for the first time this summer, went through twice since then, so 2x total with ECP and once with BTH. I really don't have the time or the mental fortitude to go through WD's again.


This time, I really want to make my WD symptoms as minimal as possible. I use about .8-1g of BTH shot a day, for the past 4 days. Before that it was about 1g spread over 3 days for about 2 weeks, and before that was sporadic use, usually about 4g's spread over 14 days.

Gonna shoot for the last time(for now) tonight, around .4, ""one last hurrah"". That leaves me with .6. How exactly should I go about ""weening off""? Smoke a point when i'm feeling sick? Will I need more? My plan right now is to shoot that tonight, wait a full 48 hours(this is when I start to show symptoms of w/d), shoot up a point, wait another 48, then smoke a point,  wait 48, smoke a point, etc, until I run out or stop feeling sick after not using for over 48 hours.

Please, anyone that's done this or knows how to feel free to help a brotha out with some advice/tips/stuff you wish you knew. I may be able to get some benzos but not more than a couple bars.",1412730179.0

Somewhat urgent.,"Hey will make this quick: I have someone here that thinks they might be od-ing on morphine/codeine from poppy seed tea. They have a lot of experience with pst and a lot of experience from this particular vendor as well, but they drank the wash from about 3/4ths or maybe 4/5ths of a pound, and they felt stronger effects than they usually feel for the entirety of a 1.5lb wash and they felt those strong effects in 15 minutes. It's probably to the point where they could still throw some up. Should they? Would that help?

Or is it generally absolutely impossible for a pound of any vendors poppy seeds to be strong enough to make someone not-opiate naive overdose?

Thanks in advance for any help guys. Had to make a throwaway quickly but I post occasionally on another account and love all of you. Thanks


Edit: Extra Info: They're worried, as am I, because he says he usually starts feeling it 30-40 minutes later, and about an hour later he's at 65-70% of full effects, then 100% at about the 2 hour point. Then from hour 2 to 6 it slowly wanes back down.

So if he feels this strongly after 15 minutes, he's worried it will increase as it usually does and if it increases by even twice this he thinks it will be way too much. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance for any advice/info.

Update: at t+65 minutes there hasn't been a huge increase of effects for him, so it seems he just metabolized the whole dose at once, and much more quickly than usually. I suppose I'll leave the post up in case anyone seeks similar advice and it assuage their worries when their worries are unnecessary. Though, I do support seeking medical help if there's ever any doubt.",1412727391.0

Any tips?,"I've been suffering from chronic pain associated with two surgeries I had to correct my scoliosis, developing arthritis in my knees, and a pre-cancerous condition called Adenoma (which will eventually lead to colon cancer). Unfortunately its been getting significantly worse in the past week or so, where before it was manageable. I also love opiates for both their recreational and pain killing properties and have since I was 14. After a lengthy discussion with my family I'm finally going to a pain management clinic to get a regular hookup from a doctor as opposed to on/off copping dope when I have the cash. I found a decent place thanks to a nurse who was also fond of opiates.

My question is what do I do? I mean obviously I'm looking to score something slightly better than oxys, but I don't wanna come on too strong. And I'm afraid to mention my past experience with drugs of this class, lest I be labelled a drug seeker. But I also don't wanna come on too soft and walk out with tramalol 50s. That might've done the trick years ago, but certainly not now. And the pain I'm experiencing is truly starting to interfere with my life. I didn't go to classes for the past week, I accidentally missed a day at work, and I just lay in bed all day because I feel like I'm goddamn 60 when I'm in my 20s. Its bullshit.

I would be okay with a shitty script if I was allowed to abuse it and just run out early, but because my family knows about my long history of drug use and abuse, they want to dispense the meds daily. Something tells me if I wind up with perc 5s they aren't going to hand over 8 of them and say have a blast. So if I go for this I want to make clear how real my pain is and how much I'm going to need to feel an effect without sounding like I'm just there to get quick access to hard drugs. Hopefully looking to get hydromorphone or oxymorphone and rail/plug that shit. But it seems unlikely :/

Have any of you been through the ringer and gotten what you wanted on your first go? I know there's no magic words I can say to just get them to hand over the narcotics, but are there any tips I should abide by? Should I not mention my tolerance and let the pain speak for itself, or just be upfront about my history and bring a sobbing mother into the room to help my case? Should I mention all my conditions or just the ones absolutely relevant to obtaining decent pain management? Thanks in advance for any insights!",1412726356.0

2ikz4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2ikz4q/the_best_drugs_for_withdrawal/,3,https://redd.it/2ikz4q,phys1cstothemax,The best drugs for withdrawal,"Now I do use loperamide for withdrawal but there is an issue. It is a partial mu-opiate so if you take enough to stop withdrawal completely for a week or so you WILL have withdrawal from the loperamide. Now I am getting the vivtrol shot in 2 weeks so the following is the best course of action for withdrawal without teh use of any opiate(subs, loperamide, methadone).

-Clonadine(alone this is not much help, but when used in combination it really helps the secondary physical symptoms)
-I have a script for gabapentin which does help but I am going to try and get my Dr. to write me a script for Lyrica(pregablin). Lyrica is a opiate withdrawal miracle drug in my opinion, it almost completely takes care of severe symptoms 
-Sleep meds(diphenhydramine, doxylamine, melatonin, promethazine, benzos and ambian)
-Phenebut
-Ibuprofin
-DXM
-Low dose dextroamphetamine or methylphendiate
-An anti-diarrhea medicine that does not have loperamide in it 

        Start out the day by taking a low dose dex or methylphendiate(the key for using these is low dose, taking a large dose will only make you feel worse. If you cannot get a script for these you can take a half dose of Benzadrex inhalers(take the cotton out and cut it in half, some people swear by the lemon juice extraction but doing this only increases the negatives)
      Along with the low dose of stims take a fair portion of phenebut along with clonadine.
             The main thing that will help with the worst of it is without a doubt the pregablin, start wiht 150mgs if you still have withdrawal take 300mgs. This stuff is STRONG. Seriously start slow if you need to do anything, ie work, school). Take the dose you feel works 3 times a day.
If you cannot get Lyrica, gabapentin works the same jut not as well. One tip for gabapentin is that instead of taking a large dose at once it actually works betteri f you stagger the dosing, so take 300mgs every 45 mins for howeevr long you feel you need it. I took 300mgs every 45 mins unti lI took like 8 pills which worked wonders. Another problem with gabapentin is after 4-5 days it almost stops working entirely.
       In the evening you can take a low dose of DXM which helps, try not to overdo teh DXM in large doses it just makes me feel terrible.
        If you can get a script for a benzo, promethazine or ambien then take that as prescribed at nighttime, if you cant a larger dose of DPH or doxylamine along with melatonin.
      Take the ibuprofen or aspirin as needed. I honestly prefer aspirin because it almost has a psychological effect where you can feel it mentally.
This is what I am going to do for the next 10 days until I can get the vivtrol shot without any risk of precipitated withdrawal symptoms.

On top of that, he's in debt to myself and the the other house mate (lets call her Jill) around $7000.

I'm a former heroin user (I guess I'll always be an addict?) so I tried as much as I could to help him and be supportive as possible, hoping I'd be able to get him out of this.  Offered to do things like handle his money for him, tried getting him on methadone and suboxone, etc.  It was clear he did not want to stop, I finally even tried to help him budget his money to include his substances.. we gave him so many chances and genuinely were trying to help him in any way possible.

Thats the backstory, he apparantly split hotel rooms with people or got his own when his check came in, probably was also on the street.  Last I heard he OD'd and shortly after ended up in the ICU with sepsis and some other nasty shit.

So thats the backstory, we're looking for a new room mate now and trying to clean up his old living area.. his closet is literally stuffed full of boxes, suitcases, and duffel bags full of used syringes and paraphanalia.  Lots of blood stains, needles full of blood or clogged, cookers.. some of the syringes are in sharps containers, others are in plastic bottles, but the majority are loose.. some capped some not.  there is blood splattered all over everything as well as on some of the walls/ceiling, which it looked like he had tried to clean up.

Sorry for the long post but how should I go about getting rid of all this?  
I was guessing the needle exchange but there must be thousands of syringes in here.  Some of the boxes he used are from places like Amazon with our address on it, there's trash mixed in with some of it with bills and other personal identifiable info, prescription bottles, magazines addressed to us stained with BTH and blood.

So after going on a few day bender after some intermittent clean/methadone time, i'm pretty sure I have the beginnings of an abscess. Which is fucking weird, after having 7 years of prior IV heroin addiction and some nasty injection practices, and not once having one. I'm sure I could google the answer to my questions but i'd rather hear from some personal experiences.

It's a hard, red, sore bump on top of my hand after missing a tiny bit of a shot about a week ago. It was originally just a usual lumpy 'miss spot' but it's been getting a bit worse. It doesn't look particularly nasty, but I want to nip it in the bud before it does.

First of all, I have medicaid. What type of facility should I be going to? An urgent care? An emergency room? Is there some type of clinic? Are there any specific places I can look up that are 'junkie-friendly' and won't treat me like an absolute piece of shit?

What do I tell whoever I'm seeing? 'I was injecting heroin and I think this is an abscess?' or 'I have this weird lump on my hand that hurts?'

If an abscess is caught early, does the scarring/healing process look particularly bad? I've seen some absolutely gnarly ones, both treated and untreated and i'd hate to have that shit RIGHT on top of my hand to be seen by the world, especially with my job. 

And last one, any personal experiences? Where did you go for treatment, how did the nurses/doctor treat you, how bad was it, how did it heal, etc. etc.

I've been doing 80-100mg of oxy per day. Not huge, but sucks to run out nonetheless.

I'm hoping to give an assessment of these popular WD meds: gabapentin, clonidine, lope (if needed for gastro only, I hope).

I am trying not to eat every pill in the gaba bottle because I want to keep the tolerance down. I don't have a ton of it. and it does seem to help, so far, but the real battle begins tomorrow morning, honestly. morning 2 I am usually in tears having panic attacks and pacing manically. still, it is showing hope, and I do have 90x gabapentin total. I will load up for 3 days if it proves necessary, and save enough to taper down for days 4-6. 

I've never had gabapentin or clonidine. they are scripted. my doctor is a pain doctor and thinks I am tapering off oxy. I guess in a way he is right, as I have a paltry 60mg left.

So far, I've taken:

Day 1:

* last 40mg of oxy last night at 8PM. (after taking 40 during the day - taper was planned but f*cking impossible)
* woke in a panic due to knowing I'm basically out. took my first ever 100mg of gabapentin (scripted) at 1am. slept by 2:15.
* woke up feeling less shitty than usual, but not by a lot. took another 100mg gabapentin at 6am.
* took another 100mg gabapentin at 7am.
* by 9am I was out on a bagel run. by now i would typically be sweating and having anxiety and clenched jaw, along with this weird tunnel-vision effect I get in early WD. nothing at 9am. felt good! 
* by 10am started feeling a little temperature change. put on clonidine patch (0.1mg/24h) which the pharmacist says will take 12-24 hours to kick in, and took another 100mg gabapentin. also took a single 10mg oxy in hopes of smoothing out the period while I wait for clonidine to kick in. feeling a little better by 10:20am.
* 4:30pm - still feeling fine. sleepy, in fact, lazy, yes, but fine. i think i do have a little bit of a fever. appetite is up, and i'm dumb but content. wish i hadn't taken that 10mg oxy. should have let this be a full day 1. it'll help my endorphins adjust more smoothly, but with this gabapentin stuff i don't even really crave anything. weird. but my belly is starting to churn a bit (the 10mg of oxy from earlier is wearing off for sure) so I added 100mg of gabapentin. this is because it takes ~2h to really take effect, so I want to stay smooth. probably could have pushed on.
* 6:15 - started feeling it again. tension, anxiety, mild panic - first hints. so i took another gabapentin. piss is dark, face is HOT, scared of night fall but hoping I can keep this shit pumping and make it through.
* 6:45 - i think the gaba is taking the edge back off. just needed another 100 i guess. this stuff works… for now.
* 7:45 - Mexican food delivered. Spicy. Gonna regret that. Did another 100mg gabapentin. Some restlessness breaking through. Minor but here. Will take 5mg oxy to sleep if need be. Chills. 
* 12:15 - woke up after getting a couple hours of sleep. yep, sleep. wow. taking another 100mg.


Day 2:

* 7:30am - slept fine. lightly but still slept. I mean, it counted, was better than most sleep during my last month clean, honestly. so far, no symptoms, no need for anything. unsure if that will last. unsure if i should take some gaba or wait to see if symptoms appear. due to rebound fears, I might take some after i BM if I can. maybe just take 400 total today, if no real symptoms. taper the gaba, I mean. cannot tell if clonidine is working yet or not. not sure how i would tell. i don’t want to be cocky and assume i skipped WD somehow. that’s when it will hit, right? so I’m 
* 10:45 - 100mg gabapentin as temp changes, restlessness/shakiness, and minor anxiety kicking in. 24h after the last oxy on the mark. hope this will calm it. 
* 11:30 - the last gaba helped. all tests confirm that this medication can help. dosage matters, for sure, but I'm still on my second day with it and slowly building up the dose seems to help. if i had a heavier habit, I'm sure I'd need 4x as much, which is still doable for gabapentin. 
* 12:15 - getting shaky again. took another 100mg of gabapentin and 10mg oxy, try to smooth the landing. 10mg per day isn't gonna draw this out too much longer and will make it smoother, I think. I mean, I was doing 10x two days ago. tomorrow I might try 5mg, then shit, maybe 2.5mg. 
* 1:45 - Not sure if it's meds, WD, or not eating today, but my stomach is starting to ache and burn in  deep way. Feels like I've got an ulcer or something, but it's my guts. Sniffles starting. Not sure about taking more gabapentin. Is it what's hurting my stomach so badly? Maybe I need food. Anyway, I wouldn't think this was opiate WD so far. Would assume I'm mildly sick in strange ways. Maybe the clonidne patch is kicking in? Gonna try some food soon. Been watching lots of TV. Maybe a walk. 




Ultimately, I wish I'd tried this while I still had half or more of my script, before dosage escalated, before running out became a reality.

I'm creating this log for everybody, but also for me, in the future, if I end up in this position again.

I had a cup of coffee after about 10 minutes to counteract the numerous passouts. It's a nice high but nothing too crazy. The K adds a little ""out of body-ness"" to everything. It's hard to keep a single thought for longer than a couple seconds. I didn't realize how risky this is respiratory wise, however I did use a tiny bit less tar than usual and I didn't snort a huge line of special K.

Overall it adds a nice air of higher pleasantess to the high. I don't know how often I would do this, but I wouldn't mind doing it again once more in the future. I read online that the dope kills most or all of the ""hallucinations"" that one would get from the Ketamine. I don't know if this is true or not, but I don't think I used enough to hallucinate anyway(very new to Ketamine).

My wife has been doing pods on and off since about 2008 and seeds since 2012.  Recently, she's has been telling me that when she does drink, about half the time she experiences kidney pain, and the last time actually got a pretty bad UTI with high fever a few days after.  

She does have a history of UTI's, but this problem seems to have developed slowly in that she'd been eating pods/drinking tea for quite a while and the pains and inability to pee weren't a problem until about a year ago.

Because of the UTI's, she drinks a ton of water, eats cranberry pills, and is insanely careful about maintaining good health in that regard, but is pretty bummed since she feels that the PST is partly responsible.  She sometimes gets a bloated appearance that fades in a day or so (she takes two benadryl beforehand as she may have a slight allergy) and the problems with urinating generally start the day after we drink, lasting for about two days or so.

It's gotten to the point that she seriously debates getting high, but still wants to, since she does it so rarely.  

She just had her yearly physical and her kidney and liver enzymes are good and she's otherwise in extremely good health.  I guess what I'd like to know is if anyone's ever heard of someone's kidneys shutting down because they drank tea?  I've searched and searched but can't find any information. 

Anyone with similar experiences or thoughts about this, I'd be grateful for your input.

Edited to add she has no problems at all with pills.",1412891498.0

I'm a long time lurker. While I do not use opiates I have had a lot of friends and family involved in their use over the years. Most of them are gone now. I find the subculture interesting.

Currently, I have two cousins, brothers in their 20s and they seem to be all fucked up, deep in pills and such. It's been going on for at least a few years. They kept it manageable for a while, but now the train is off the rails and it's pretty apparent.

The older boy was busted a few years ago shipping pretty big quantities of weed via a big courier service. He escaped with a slap on the wrist thanks to dad ponying up whatever it took lawyer and connection wise. Last time I saw him at a family gathering he was nodding out my couch. Everyone else was all ""oh XXX, you must be so tired!"" Naw, son, full on nods. I left it alone. Since then I've only heard things, none of them good. He was just booted from college again. He's in another state so I don't see him much.

Younger bro, was home invaded recently and ""robbed"" at gun point. That's what he says. About a year ago, something similar happened and the police found a bunch of needles and shit at the scene. There has also been a number of other incidents where his face got all fucked up and his story is always ""i fell"". I think he's getting smacked up by someone(s) for whatever. He did a stint in rehab one time too for pills.

These boys are soft suburban kids with a father who is just dying because of this shit. In my opinion, the are stupid and not cut out for drug street shit. He's throwing money at the problem. I'm not sure he's able to see what's happening. The problems keep coming and they seem to get more violent as time passes. They have been able to walk away so far, but I feel that something truly terrible is coming for them. Prison, death, the street. 

I don't have to do anything. They are family, but we are not especially close. I have my own family and a very very busy life. But it kills me to see their father watching this play out. I'm not sure what I should do, if anything?

Any thoughts? 

edit: regarding what I should do. I mean, should I try to speak to their father about the nuances in this thing? He's older and super square. Should I take him to dinner and perhaps share my thoughts on this? Is that too forward? Too busy body?

I give him the 100 bucks I had in my hand (had an envelope with 400 more in my back jeans pocket) and my boy (driver) hands over all the money he has.

He gets my iphone, my new airmax 96s, ands then starts pistol whipping me, demanding more money. I finally give him the envelope with the 400 hundred, and then he gets super pissed.

She doesn't use them anymore because they put her some something stronger, so she isn't being inconvenienced by me taking them.

I started out just taking 1/2 to a full pill every day, and after a month of using, I'm ashamed to admit my habit has jumped to about 2-3 pills a day.  I'm really worried now because I only have about a weeks supply of tylenol 3s, and once there gone I won't be able to get anymore.

How bad are the W/D going to be?  I'm absolutely terrified because I've never done drugs before this, and don't know what to expect.  I don't want to start taking my grandma's Vicodin 5/500mg because I heard that they are really addicting compared to what I'm addicted to now.

Will the W/D from tylenol 3s be bad enough that I should ask my Dr to put me on suboxone?  I read that they prevent W/D, and won't make me want to use anymore.

I would really appreciate any advice on what to do to prepare myself so I can get clean.  If you have any suggestions on weening myself off or a detox plan I would be really grateful :)

Surprisingly enough, it hasn't been that bad. I'm not craving dope at all, and have been able to keep myself quite content with simply smoking weed. And to top it all off today, I finally managed to get in with a doctor about my actual mental health issues and was prescribed 90 .5mg xanax. I'm pretty happy about it, as I legitimately need something to deal with anxiety attacks that occur on occasion that I used to manage with dope. Only thing I'm worried about is that before I left the office, I had to piss in a cup. I'm really hoping that dope won't show up in my piss as it had been 6 days since I last did any. Weed will for sure show up though. So, I'm not really sure what's going to happen when my Dr. gets those results back. Also, I'm sure I might have written on here before about how I literally have ZERO visible veins and that I'm impossible to hit, which has been a very helpful contribution to the fact that I never tried the needle in my years of sniffing dope. I also had to get blood drawn, and they ended up giving up completely. In the last 2 years that I have gone to get blood drawn, NOT ONCE has anybody been able to actually hit a vein. The doctors ended up giving up after trying about 5 different spots. From what the guy told me, my blood pressure fluctuates rapidly so much that one second, the vein will be there, and by the time he goes to put the needle in, it's already gone.

I was going to post a pill p0rn picture but I figured, eh, why bother? It's  not an opiate so most of ya'll wouldn't be too interested. But boy oh boy does 90 xanax look pretty sitting all piled up in the palm of your hand lol. Btw, I'm actually not looking to abuse these.

Last 3 days been on subs and benzos for wds xans yesterday my girl calls me out for being fucked up and lying to her again. Cause I was....trying to get some dope for subs. Just one last time I know we all say that but I meant it.....she then tells me that we are done and this was the last time she can believe me or be with me.


I am honestly trying the hardest I've ever tried to stop and she doesn't believe me. She won't believe me. She thinks that it a one and done thing and relapses are for people who aren't serious. I need to prove it but that won't be enough...i think I lost her forever. A few days after our 2 yr anniversary.... I honestly felt like I was gonna spend the rest of my life with her and she said she did too but can't deal with the lies. I have tried to talking but nothing is changing her mind.


I am getting clean for me but she thinks it is for her and obviously we know that doesn't work.

She told me if things are meant to be we will be together...sounds to me like a story tale cop out.

 I am planning on focusing on me. Getting counseling, clean and back to who she fell in love with. And if she doesn't want to get back together I am still going to be strong and better because of it.

Just wanted to vent and you guys are awesome for advice and whatnot. Any comments or helpful/realistic advice or similar situations would be awesome.

woke up at ~1-1.30 a.m. (boston-time) with 3/4 of a bag of fire in the pocket of my jeans downstairs and the thought of it burning a hole in my mind- sleeping rendered impossible. worked my ass off for the 80 bucks i spent 11 hours earlier when i copped 2 fat bags of fire powder...that powder: basically my personal illicit energy drink in powdered form (as i think of it in my mind). (also, dont know if this has ne thing to do with anything but im a sniffer, 100%, love it. never tried a needle to get high, been a heavy addict for 4 years now and only a handful of times ive been seriously tempted with it..i dont judge ppl who do at all, just not my bag- no pun intended but intended)

anyways, JJ came thru for me and i found $40 in a pair of work jeans i thought i had lost last week when i got up to use the bathroom. WORD!!! that 3/4 of a bag was supposed to last me until tues (..teehee) so this means I can buy more!

not to mention, earlier when I picked up the two bags....which was my plan, get 2 bags, do one saturday and one sunday (which wont leave me too high either day but at least its not hurting!) but my friend who knows the dealer (refuses to give me the connect bc he knows i hook him up with a lil bit of mine when i pick up which is at least 4-5 times a week so i can always be high) he goes, my friend, ""u wanna split a bag?"" yes, i say, of course im not gunna say no, im sitting at his house waiting on his connect what am i gunna do? say no? but that kinda fucks up my plans bc now i only am getting 1 1/2 bags.

1 1/2 bags for me means
1/2 bag sniffed right off the bat
1/2 of a 1/4 bag bump 20 min later
on my walk home another 1/2 of a 1/4 bag bump
now, at 5 am, after reading wikipedia and reddit opiates for hours, finally just said fuck it and did the beautiful, heavenly rest (was trying to wait til 8 am...HAHAHA yea ok!) 

$40 in my pocket, ~10.45-11 a.m. i'll hit up my buddy and repeat this miserable process.

I'd been living in Oakland and moved to my hometown rural area hours away to start over and get clean but this just made everything worse.  I was now closer to Modesto where I had my strongest cheapest dope connection and was in a little apartment with no friends or job and 10k in savings.

I threw up everyday, didn't shit for what seemed like 2 months, got down to 135 lbs at 6' and felt on the verge of dying.  On July 5th I drove to Manteca to meet my connection, who was just another junky with the actual connection.

Due to it being the day after the 4th what would normally be an hour and a half drive took 4 hours to arrive to the Wendys parking lot I'd wait in.  I then waited for my friend to show for2 hours before giving up on him.  I couldn't run my battery this long so I was really burning up in the heat.  

Then he texted and said he fell asleep and would be there soon.  I waited and sweated another 2 hours.  While thinking about how addicted and sick I was, what a poor spot I was in with losers having this power over me.  I gave up and started to drive home.  I got half way there when he texted back and apologized, he nodded out again, he had the stuff and I just had to drive back and get it.  The drive back was another 2 hours.

He actually met me at Wendys this time but bad news, he thought he'd have met the guy by now but he hadn't shown.  We drove to a Starbucks to wait.  The guy was coming back from Fresno and about 30 minutes from bringing us our dope for the next 6 hours when he said he was still there and wasn't leaving today.

My friend asked if I wanted to go to the ghetto and try to hook up through homeless people but after so many hours of sweating in this heat, waiting and waiting, everything smelling like shit dope sick I just wanted to go home to a couple methadone pills I had just in case.

The drive home I was thinking about what a horrible lifestyle this is.  How I'm letting assholes like this have power over me.  I was supposed to go to my mom's for dinner that night and kept texting her pushing it back, making up lies and excuses, making me feel like a piece of shit.

As I got home I decided I should go there and tell her whats up but should take a shower first because I was sweating like crazy all day.  In the shower I started to shake and hyperventilate scared about what was to come, or what was to happen to me if I didn't tell anyone.

2iyp88,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2iyp88/my_perfect_setup_hooray_wheel_filters/,4,https://redd.it/2iyp88,hedohenry,My perfect setup// Hooray wheel filters,"soo.. I posted about me getting wheel filters and starting off preparing 10dose solutions, but as one of the guys mentioned, it's just way to hard to control yourself not to constantly redose if it's as easy as draw up and shoot..

so I stopped doing that and went back to filtering with cotton, as I thought the wheel filters were not practical for single doses..
I thought there would be too much getting stuck inside the wheel to make it efficient for single shots...

turns out I was wrong.. I tried running 1ml of plain water through it, just to see how much I would end up with in the end.. 
surprisingly after chasing some air after the ml through the filter, I ended up having 95 out of 100 Units..
that's fantastic.. nearly nothing..

so now, this is my perfect setup (for shooting IR OXY..) and in favor of harm reduction I'd recommend everyone out there who's on the same path to switch to using a similar setup..

so I got

- 2 sterile cups (I got 2 tiny glass ones.. which i clean with alcohol and reuse)

- cotton (using american spirit, think I read once they still only use cotton for their filters.. but whatever)

- wheel filter ( I'm using a 0,2nm PVDF one.. easy to get on amazon.. I'll attach Link on the bottom)

- 10ml sterile syringe (to fit to wheel filter, see link on bottom)

- Insulin syringe (using BD ultrafine 31G 1cc only.. absolute best in my opinion)

- sterile water (using SmartWater or any other condensed one which I prepare for injection by boiling for a couple of minutes.. usually preparing like 50ml in the morning which i keep in a sterile vial in the fridge throughout the day)

- berries :D mhh.. my drug of choice are the delicious 30mg IR oxy

soo.. 

crush the berries (2 are kinda the limit for 1ml I'd say.. it's too much filler otherwise.. for shots bigger than 60mg I use a 3ml slip tip rig with 30G slip spike)

add water and let it sit for few minutes

cut ends off cigarette filter, then cut of a nice little piece

dip the filter in clean water and then suck it all out with the 10ml syringe

now put filter in oxy solution and suck the solution through the filter into 10ml syringe

attach wheel filter (forgot to mention, run clean water through the filter before using it with Oxysolution to moisturize 
the membranes inside) and push the solution through it.. 

chase air through it until nothing comes out of the filter any longer..

draw the remaining solution up into the insulin syringe - et voila..
a clean solution which doesn't leave you wondering what you are constantly doing to your body - ready for injection

soo guys.. GET WHEEL FILTERS!! they're totally worth it.. I know how easy it is to getting used to ignoring what damage the shit does we pump into our system.. 
but remember the days of your first shots.. how meticulously you'd prepare your shots, at least I did.. nothing changed just because your body doesn't react instantly on one shot containing shit doesn't mean there isn't shit accumulating and causing severe long term damage..

hihi.. I can remember how concerned i was, shooting the bright blue qualitest.. but even THAT the filter gets out btw... clear solution, even with qualitest ..
all right.. here's the amazon link for filters.. so convenient.. they also have bigger packs.. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DDZM2S2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

therefore

stay well guys - shoot clean shit

So, like any regular poster on here, I love this sub. (throwaway account because I'm afraid I'm about to voice an unpopular opinion, which is sad, but this needs to be put out there urgently, i think) I really do!

It's cozy, sorta like my body after a nice, fat shot of heroin. It's also filled with discussions about opiates and other such things. Which I fucking love! It's also great that not too many subscribers here are on their high horses about their own DOC too *cough*r/drugs*cough*r/trees**cough* (I love acid and weed just as much as the next person but I certainly don't think it makes me *better* than anyone because of it)

It's also nice that this sub doesn't hold views of minorities that are drenched in stereotypes, views that makes r/trees look like a sad, sorry collection of pathetic, sheltered ass privileged high schoo...  

Oooooooh... Wait. 

Something's not right here. 

Why are people dropping n-bombs on this sub like they're saying ""oatmeal raisin cookie"" or ""grandma"" or other such innocuous things? Seriously though, what is it with all the bigoted shit that I see on here, and worse, cold acceptance and lack of protest of such remarks?

Look, I understand that maybe one day some of you were maybe cold copping or something and were stupid enough to give your money to someone that sold you drywall. And yeah, maybe that person happened to be black. It sure has happened to me before, being from LA, and plenty of times too back in my novice days. But I *totally* missed the part where you now all get license to just drop n-bombs all over the place because some black dude hustled you. 

If some black dude fucked you over at one point in your opiate career, well, I'm sorry, but why do some then feel compelled to direct such ugly, hateful words towards all members of a race in response?

We're all aware of the disgusting, inhumane history behind the word, I'm assuming? I hope? How could anyone aware of the word's history be ok with using it, given *who* used to use it and especially given *the context in which it was used.*  I mean... Just inexcusable.

So can we please stop with the tasteless dropping of n-bombs all over? It was, quite frankly, shocking, to encounter multiple threads full of people just dropping the word, without a whimper of protest from other readers. Really, the most disturbing part of it all was seeing how casually others greeted the use of the word. This is an environment people are comfortable interacting in? How anyone could purposefully type that word out and proudly display their username right next to it, as if there's just nothing at all wrong with it, is way beyond me. The idea that anyone can hold contempt for *entire races* is just mind-boggling. It's ugly, and something to be deeply ashamed of. A sad reminder of the progress that remains to be made.

I really do enjoy browsing this sub for the most part. Love the stories on here, love the sense of community and being able to offer guidance to those in need, and  just sharing those crucial tricks of the junkie trade, etc. But can we please, please make an effort to stop fueling the stereotype that junkies are selfish, cutthroat scum and reconsider the use of such hateful, tasteless language? Please?

We have enough of a bad rep in the public eye, we should avoid adding ""unabashedly racist"" to that long list. 


Sorry for the rant, but it's 2014, not 1812. Those views and attitudes have no place in our society. Thanks for reading. 


EDIT: I'm intrigued by the number of people compelled to downvote this post, because dissenting opinions within the thread are either slim, tongue-in-cheek, or nonexistent. Users and defenders of the n-word, help me understand how you could possibly think it's cool to call a black person this. Are you just ok with being really racist because you're convinced that black people are inferior to you or something? What's the thought process here? I have a  half gram of tar and a couple hours to kill, please, allow me a glimpse into your mysterious minds

But I am OBSESSED with getting high. It's all I can think about. I feel like a piece of shit because I keep on thinking about stealing from my family, but I really don't want to do it. I've done that before when I was in a really bad stage, and I really don't want to go back to that. The only time I can get any peace is when I'm sleeping, or reading a book (I've read 3 books in the past 3 days ha). 

I feel like I'm broken or something, I hate this compulsion I have to get high. I know I don't *need* it, but it consumes 90% of my thoughts. Am I always going to be like this? Luckily I'll be on subs later this week, so at least I have something to look forward to. I was on them a couple years ago, it was like flipping the addiction switch from on to off for me. I know it's just switching one thing for another, but at least I'm not spending every dollar and every waking minute getting high.

**UPDATE:** So I went into to speak to the counselour that works for the sub doc, and I was able to get my prescription a today! I feel so much better now. I know a lot of people think I'm foolish for taking subs because I'm over the physical dependence, but I discussed this with my counselour, and she told me that it is for helping with the mental addiction (which is what I am really struggling with) as well as the physical. Say what you want, but I'd rather be taking a sub a day and be able to work and interact with my family, than be all sullen and depressed like I have been for the past week. I know that I am still taking an opiate, but I have to do what I think is best for me.

All the bad shit that has probably happened to her (the meth and heroin game is not good to innocent looking girls) because of her lifestyle choices. She told me she has made a lot of bad choices. I feel like it goes beyond that. Do we really choose this shit? I went from using just for fun to shooting heroin and smoking crack everyday. I don't ever really making the decision to do that. I was ruled by cravings, nothing in my life was satisfying me so I sought pleasure from things outside of myself. 

I almost died a couple times.

When I was using I prayed to get clean, ushually when I was high. It eventually came about and i'm extremely grateful for that.

All that remains are the awesome ""what will you do for drugs?"" lines! I've been pretty boring, just working a minimum wage job. So far, the couple times I've ran out of money I've just stopped for a couple months. I've stolen some money here and there from my parents, but not a lot. 

But in the past month, I've been looking at not having any money for quite a while so I decided to get a job. (I never had one where I go to school, only where I'm from and where I would go back to in the summer). As I posted about earlier, a couple weeks ago I went to an interview thinking it was for bar tending/cocktail waitress, as I'm a good waitress and replied to a couple Criaglist ads. I ended up getting a job camming.

This was never a line I created in my head, but I suppose taking my clothes off for drug money was not something I ever thought I'd be doing. And I ended up doing that. It took a 3 hour shift for me to get fucking bored. I mean, it's tiring and repetitive! People on here warned me it might be a scam...and my next shift I realized how much money they were taking from me and I was like, fuck this. Not worth it. I found 2 of the girls in their room who I had made friends with last time to talk to them about it. That's when the subject of escorting came up.

One of the girls used to escort, and I started to ask her all about it. I had never actually met an escort and didn't know anything about the business. Well, she told us everything, and me and her (and my new) friend started talking about how we'd like to try it.

Basically my thought process was: I could make a lot more money than camming, like a LOT. I'd also get to keep every cent, no company bullshit and no taxes either, and all of it in cash. Also, it'd be a lot easier to take my clothes off and have one experience with one guy in a night instead of doing it over and over again for so much less. Not to mention, guys are a lot nicer in person than they are over the computer. 

Anyways, I decided to try it. And here I have the best luck in the world...I can't even imagine. I posted on one of the well known sites, and started getting calls and texts right away. The first couple calls I took, however, the guys were hard to understand, sounded fucked up. I was in the middle of negotiating things over text (risky, I know, but it was all time and place kind of shit) when I got a call from a guy who seemed nice and who could come pick me up in a half hour, no fuss. I know I'm not supposed to accept rides from clients, but I don't have a ride and he sounded nice and...shut up I'm broke and desperate here! My own well being hasn't been on the top of my list of things I give a shit about for a while.

So he picks me up, and he's a bit older than he sounded on the phone, but not bad looking. Definitely does not have to pay for sex lol. Its a long ride back to his place, so we end up talking and hit it off. We both ask vague questions for a bit but eventually figure out we both do drugs. It turns out, he actually helps out a lot of escorts and called me because he was putting up another girls ad and didn't recognize me. I look innocent, basically, haha.

He's not a pimp, but he drives girls around and waits for them to be done, so in case something goes wrong he can be there right away and take care of it. He charges for it, but instead of 200, I charge 250 and give him 50. He also deals everything for cheaper than I've ever seen. Which is awesome.

Most importantly, and why I was so lucky, he knows everything about this game and dumped all the information I could want onto my head. Not only about how it works, but also the legal aspects of it. I didn't know shit about how to go about any of this. Not that I couldn't figure out some of the things he told me, but I avoided getting taken advantage of.

Anyways: the point of this post was...last night I had my first 2 clients. I officially prostituted myself, something I'd never thought I'd do. The second it was over though, I felt nothing. The adrenaline, fear, and excitement beforehand was the worst part. 

Just this summer, my therapist asked me if I would ever do that, and it was just like with needles...I couldn't imagine doing that. Mostly because even with people I love, I find it impossible to have sex unless I really want to. I'm also very emotional. 

That's the trick though, and I figured it out pretty quick. Just make it business, not personal. When its business, its not complicated. And I feel a lot better knowing someone knows where I am and has my back. What freaks me out more than anything is how disconnected I am from it. I have money, I don't care. I feel like should care more.",1413291652.0

2j7fuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2j7fuh/crossing_lines/,2,https://redd.it/2j7fuh,for_tits_and_giggles,Crossing lines,"Ok, this was what my last post was SUPPOSED to be about. I started by trying to explain the first line I crossed in my addiction, but ended up just giving a whole history on my addiction. Here, I managed to get to the lines crossed in my addiction, just not the most recent one. I still failed to get to my point...so here's another meth rant. I'm closer than I was before though, and next post I will definitely have no where to ramble to escape discussing what is actually going on, in the present. So once again, this is more for me than for anyone else. 

Everyone has lines when it comes to drugs. I've found that most people have a line when it comes to using drugs, as I'm sure you have too. I like to imagine all the drugs in the world laid out, with big white lines drawn in-between them. And everyone has a line that they won't cross: any drug past that line, they won't touch.

Some common lines I've encountered are: 

1. nothing besides weed or alcohol (it's interesting how cigarettes slip about this line...they don't fit nicely into the drug lineup I mentioned above)

2. nothing man made (so including shrooms, but no pills)

3. no hard drugs (so including pills now)

4. I'll do coke, but no h, g, or crack

5. and my favorite ""I'll do heroin but not meth,"" or ""I'll do meth but not heroin."" As someone who indulges in both quite regularly, both sides make sense to me in different fucked up ways. I won't dare write another word about it, though, because I could take up many full post rants going on about h and g.

In between the lines of drugs, everyone has lines. And drug addiction fucks with those lines. 

The big one that comes to mind, of course, is the needle. I assume that that thats a line for just about everyone. At least, in my experience so far, I've only met two types of people: people who have shot up and people who never will. I started smoking h and I, naturally, was never going to shoot up. I was terrified of needles, for one thing. I still am and still can't shoot myself up (thank god). 

It's odd now, of course, listening to people, non users and users, describe with utter conviction that they could never do that. It's not that I don't believe them; I do, 100%, whether they use or don't. It's weird, because I know I felt exactly like them not that long ago (about a year, to be not so exact). I can't remember exactly how it felt, but I can remember the thoughts. I know I truly considering shooting just as crazy as it is to the person who has never even touched drugs. The level of crazy where you can't even imagine doing it, probably exactly how heroin is to most people too, ironically. When I admit to close friends I've shot up before, they almost always describe this feeling. Probably because a surreal divide has been automatically created between us by me having experienced and done something they can't even imagine doing, and they want to explain it. I have experienced the other end of it too, for example, when someone told me they killed someone while in the army. I don't like them any less, but we are inevitably very different from each other, for he has experienced something I can't imagine, much less understand. And the first thing I said was ""I can't imagine...""

When on the creator-of-the-divide side, I always tell them...""hey...I felt exactly how you do now. I was thinking the same thing and I would react the same way to other people admitting they used the needle.""

And honestly, I don't know how things would've gone if my opinions on the needle had been left alone. If I had kept smoking by myself. Or if I had started hanging out with other users, if they had only smoked too. Its not impossible, because I know multiple people who only smoke, and who have only smoked for many years. 

I wasn't quite ready to be shoot up when I was. I think I had been smoking for about a month every day (and a month since my very first time). However, I was just starting to experience a rise in tolerance, and using as not a means to get high, but primarily a means to not feel like shit. Another month, and I'm sure I would have been begging to try the needle. As a matter of fact, that was the original plan. 

The situation was this: I had started hanging out regularly with my dealer, who I met through this subreddit, and who unfortunately passed away. I'll call him R. After many months of just smoking, he had starting shooting up, so he was a couple steps ahead of me. He wasn't far enough ahead, however, to have had any bad experiences from shooting up. He still had his job, he was making money dealing on the side, etc. There were some strippers crashing at his place/heroin den that had to shoot up every 5 hours that should have provided as a good warning, but we all know that we won't turn out like them.  

He felt protective of me, and wanted me to wait...but in the end, I think he really wanted someone to shoot up with. I was his only real friend, and he was my only real friend. He wanted us to be on the same page, which I understand. Hell, I crossed my first line, meth, in the first few days of hanging out with him. I never in a million years thought I'd do meth (I'd seen the PSAs!). But I was high and saw multiple people who, although addicted to heroin, were fine with just using meth occasionally. Which actually was a pretty accurate representation of what I've been able to do too. I just don't like it as much as heroin, sorry meth.

I wish I remembered more about the first time he shot me up...well, more particularly, more about what happened right before, what I said, what he said, etc. I remember I had smoked a little, so I was apathetic enough to let him do it. I think it was one of those situations where I wanted to get it over with so he would stop bothering me about it. I wanted him to stop asking me if I was ready. All I know for sure was that I wasn't ready and I didn't want it, but I also knew that eventually I would probably want it and do it. 

I didn't even get that high. I think he missed, and I had already smoked a bit. I felt it a bit in the car home. But not really. 

The next time was the time that opened my eyes to what all the fuss was about. He loved it. I just sat in his chair and whispered ""fuck"" every couple minutes and he couldn't stop laughing. It was a pretty great experience (I mean that, I had a fucking blast). 

So now I can't imagine not shooting up...even though I've only done it 30-40 times, and always randomly, when someone was there who could help me. It's good where it's at...sitting on pedestal above everything else. It's all I can think about, but it's so good I can still enjoy smoking, it's just like a totally different drug to me. If I ever master shooting myself up, I'm fucked. So I don't even try anymore. It's also a waste of dope.

Man, I really wish I remember more. I feel like we might have had some arguments at 5 am about him shooting me up, with R flip-flopping between extremely apologetic to extremely defensive, insisting I wanted it. Of course, the truth lies somewhere in between. 

I don't blame him exactly...the situation was complicated, of course. Nothing is easy when you're all drug addicts. My main issue was that he insisted he ""loved"" me, which bothered me when he couldn't see how selfish his love was. He was adamant that I didn't let h fuck up my life...and at first he insisted I never shoot up. Then he said fine, he would shoot me up, but only because it would be better he do it to me safely, than I do it to myself and fuck it up or have some one else I didn't trust do it. If only he shot me up, then he could control my use and make sure it didn't escalate out of my control, too. But he would wait until I was desperate. I can't remember how he justified shooting me up right there and then when I didn't really want to and was honestly terrified, but I'm sure it was good and I'm sure he even convinced himself of his noble intentions in that moment. 

He did a lot of other things that perfectly outlined how selfish his love was for me, and not really love at all. More infatuation, or obsession. I'm not sure...maybe if we were sober it would've all been different. Almost definitely, probably. Haha. That bullshit, though, was what really infuriated me, and why there are some negative thoughts and feelings when I remember him.  

Ironically, however, maybe it was for the best that he shot me up when I didn't really want it yet. If I had been desperate, I would have ended up shooting up all the time right away. But because I was still enjoying smoking for the most part, shooting up became this special treat and for 2 or 3 months I had a fairly easy time just doing it every 4 days or so. I actually ended up quitting smoking because I hated being addicted to h, and managed to chip like that. It probably would have escalated into more, though, given enough time. Some stuff happened, you know how stuff does, and the chipping game ended.

I finished it and my pupils weren't even small,  so I loaded another .1 or so,  same thing slightly high but I figured I'd be ROCKED even after the first one.. so I load up the last .2 and finish it which leads me to now.. kinda high but shouldn't I be nodding my face off?

The person that gave them to me, said that they mimic benzo effects, but are safer, and do not interfere with GABA receptors.

I was very skeptical at first, but let me tell you: It is a WONDERFUL drug.

Report:

T - 00.00 - Snorted 250mgs of good quality #3 Heroin. It was my evening dose, and it made me feel good. Okay.

T - 00.01 - Took 1mg of Flunitrazepam, as I always do with H. Had in mind that I'd take the Lyrica later, so I didn't take 2mgs.

T - 00.30 - After feeling relatively fine, I took orally 75mgs of Lyrica.

T - 01:15 - OH MY EFFING SATAN. I feel a body high, similar to our first newbie times. The high is a combo of opiates and benzos. Feeling relaxed, inspired, and my body parts feel orgasms coming in waves. 

T - 03:00 - No comedown yet. I feel that my G.A.D. has dissapeared completely for the first time in years. I feel like a child.

All in all, to keep it short. Lyrica is a miracle drug and is very underrated, as well as rarely mentioned.

It does NOT need a special prescription. My local pharmacy even told me that they can sell it to me without any prescr. at all, because they believe it helps benzo addicts to stop their habit (which is true).

Do not try the above combo before doing research, and listening to your body.

P.S. It has a psychedelic quality in larger doses. Music sounds incredible, and I would dance my ass off if it weren't for the nodding from the combo. What a surprise drug!",1413278744.0

However, if you're using opiates to escape from pain and suffering that isn't physical, please find the right help. I abuse opiates because it made life better. He did it because it made life bearable. It doesn't take long for this shit to turn on you. If you've used long enough, you exactly what I mean.

About three months ago we kicked a nasty little heroin habit together and have actually been very good since. 

We'd dabble with a little bag once a month or so but that would be it. 

Well I came down with one hell of a toothache friday morning and being uninsured I did the only thing I could think to do. I got on the phone trying to find some black market pain relief.

That pain relief came in the form of 3 opana 20mg ER. Overkill? Sure but what the hell if you're going to be a son of a bitch then be a motherfucker.

I did snorted half of one while she was out with friends. About two hours later she comes home and we each do a half. About two hours after that we do another half.

Now its around 6:30 in the morning and I come out of a pleasant nod because something just doesn't feel right.

When I roll over I see a sight I'll never forget. My gf is a deathly blue with a line of drool/mucus/vomit running from her mouth.

I call 911 and immediately start doing chest compressions and rescue breaths. Cursing myself for throwing out the narcan after we kicked. Neither of us ever OD'd while on smack but now.....


She's OK now thank god

I tried with 100g of seeds and didn't feel a damn thing with no opiate tolerance, so I figured they weren't good seeds. I put the rest (a little less than 350g I suppose) in the freezer for some future baking project of something.Fast forward to yesterday, I wake up at like 1a.m. and am supremely bored. I have sort of a problem with substance use, like I'll smoke an 1/8 of good weed a day if I have it (which is a problem since I have no job) or do MXE all day until I'm too spun to hold a conversation. So having neither of those and not wanting to spend the money to get weed, I remember those seeds in my freezer.I put a small amount in a bottle just to see what color they make the water, and its a decently opaque yellow, so I go ahead and put the rest in one of those refillable water bottles with the pop tops (great filter btw) and shake it all up for a bit over 10 minutes.I drank it all over the course of an hour or so and was feeling buzzed by the time I finished. An hour after that I was feeling a very nice relaxing yet stimulating euphoria with some not-unpleasant itches to go along. It was better than my first kratom experiences, which surprised me a little because I actually managed to catch a nod with some good Bali before.So I smoke a cigarette about 2.5 hours after drinking the tea, and holy fuck was that a great cigarette. A couple hours later I had another one outside in the sun, listening to some Velvet Underground, and it brought back that initial euphoria that had faded into the background by then. I stayed nice and high all day until around 5 (drank the tea around 7) and then I ate dinner and fell asleep early and slept all night, which **never** happens.I've decided I could never make opiates a regular thing while living with my mom and grandma. Not because of addiction or cost (which are obviously worries of everyone) but because they're so annoying I'd probably just opi-rage on them all the time.",1413370731.0

One of my friends is addicted to heroin and despite wanting to get off of it, can't really risk losing his job to take time off for detox, not to mention our area has been hit so hard with heroin use that getting into a treatment center for methadone, etc has a lead time of something like 6 months.


I'm in recovery for other addictions and have never used heroin, but at this point my primary concern is making sure he's as safe as possible while he's using. I'd like to give him a sort of harm-reduction ""care package"" but I don't know where to begin. I was thinking of giving him a few bottles of rubbing alcohol, cotton balls and medical tape, rubbing alcohol pads, and some packages of brand new, fresh, clean and sterile syringes and needles. If he's going to be shooting up I worry about him getting HIV, Hep C, etc by sharing dirty needles due to a lack of funds. Is there anything you guys would recommend I add to that?


My other concern is how much weight he's lost. Pretty much all of his spare money is going to heroin and right now he's not exactly interested in preparing food, let alone eating it, while high. I thought I'd also drop off some food that he can keep in his freezer and just reheat in the microwave when he needs to make it easier on him to keep himself fed. Is there anything you all would suggest I make or anything you think I should absolutely avoid? 

I appreciate any and all suggestions and input. I know my friend is suffering right now and I want to do what I can to help keep him as safe and healthy as he can be given the circumstances. Thank you!",1413347742.0

ok, so with that out of the way. I know that its said you should not take subox until 24 hours after your last dose of opiate/opioid. you don't have to wait that long. once you start feeling discomfort, crumble off a teensy tiny little piece of med, AND I MEAN TEENSY (if its tab format, I've never used the film but I am sure the same concept applies.) and place it under your tongue. wait for a little bit and repeat until the worst of your discomfort goes away.

 Wait again for awhile until you start feeling discomfort and repeat. If you are very careful, and do this in tiny doses, you can manage the transition to full suboxone intake within 24 hours without ever feeling anything other than minor discomfort. 

Do not ever just pop a whole dose within that 24 hours period or you will feel like hell came to live inside your body.

I hope this advice helps make someone's day better.

I'm going through the total opposite this time.

i waited 20ish hours from my last hit of dope before going into the clinic. i was puking sick so i knew i was sick enough to take it this time. i get 4mg. i still feel like shit and my anxiety is crazy and I'm restless and holy shit i want to give up. i had an hour to go before i was supposed to re-dose but i knew id never last that long when each minute feels like an hour. so my mom gets them to re-dose me. another 4mg. i actually feel a little bit better this time but my anxiety and restlessness is still there. at least I'm not puking anymore. two hours later i get my final 4mg of the day (total 12mg) and they let me leave. I'm jittery throughout the entire cab ride home. i try to lay down in my bed but whatever i do i can't get comfortable. my anxiety is driving me nuts and all i want is to feel better. so of course i do a shot. wound up doing 3 points that night. so i go back to the clinic and they up me to 16mg and tell me to wait 8-12 hours before re-dosing, i waited 14. i take the sub and again I'm getting the same reaction, crazy anxiety and restlessness, sore muscles, dizziness and queasy as fuck stomach. so i do a hit.

its been 5 days and everyday i feel a little better when i re-dose but I'm still trying to stop using. oh and every single day i wake up i wake up sweaty having an anxiety attack and it takes me a good hour to calm down before i can get up and go on with my day. but every day when i re-dose i feel a little better than the day before. i tried not to  use today but i had class and christ i couldn't sit still on that chair. I'm trying to cut down. but i just feel so exhausted everyday. and every time i use i wind up crying and telling myself to stop being a stupid weak bitch and to fucking get it together.

i see my doc on thursday. do i need a higher dose of sub or do i just need to get my shit together?

and how have your first week on sub gone? any weird side effects like I'm getting or did it go well?

i guess i should also mention that i spent the whole summer tapering from 110ml of methadone (had been on 110 for 1-2 years) down to 40ml before switching. i stopped methadone for two months before my sub induction and used 3 points of heroin daily during that time.

EDIT: forgot to mention that i have no appetite. i didn't eat for 3 days and I'm slowly starting to eat again. i put food in my mouth and it makes me want to spit it out. i eat a little more everyday but nowhere close to how much i should be eating.",1413342297.0

What is it that keeps you going?  As someone who went through a really bad 3 year period of time where I pretty much lost everything savings, job, friends, my health.. accidentally overdosed a few times.  Started using heroin to self medicate after being so depressed I would spend the entire day laying in my bed, couldn't bring myself to shower, I was pathetic.  I knew it, my family knew it.. I then discovered oxy, and then heroin.  I was able to go out and do things.  It started like that, then it turned into sitting in a room with ""friends"" slowly but surely draining my savings/401k/investments.  Eventually it ran out.

I did rehab, suboxone, relapsed, fast forward 3 years and finally I get clean.  Got put on a cocktail of antidepressants.  Have had a steady job for 5 years now.  No drugs/drinking for almost 7.  I just don't know what any of this is for, I fake it a smile and happy demeanor day in and day out, pay my bills, am ""successful"".  I feel numb though, I don't see a point to any of it.

So to answer my question, I think the only thing keeping me from loading up a syringe with a few bundles of ecp and saying goodbye cruel world is my brother and mom.  Even when I was in and out of the hospital at my worst they always told me how much they loved me and couldn't imagine living without me.  Thats what keeps me going.  If they weren't in my life, I'd have checked out a long time ago.

anyone relate?  what keeps you going?",1413312593.0

It was a small amount and she doesn't have a record. She was driving at the time with an anxiolytic in her system and was pulled over for driving while ability impaired (another charge against her), that's when they found the heroin on her. Has anyone had experience with this? I'm hoping that if she shows significant intention to change the courts will give her a conditional sentence or something (i.e. seek therapy or rehab of some kind - this is the 3rd serious incident in 2 months, so yes, do I think she needs treatment). 

Any anecdotal information she's finding seems to come out of the US and does not look promising at all, but I genuinely think she has a chance. Thoughts?",1413311709.0

That includes codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, IR morphine, tramadol, and hydromorphone.  For me, on an empty stomach, oxy seems to take about 15 minutes at the very most for me to start feeling it, most of the other ones I listed take at least 30-45 minutes or even longer. The only one I could think of a reason for would be codeine (and tramadol to an extent) because it's a prodrug and needs to be metabolized before it's active, but that doesn't apply to any of the other ones I listed though.

Not complaining or anything, just something interesting I noticed (and yet another reason to love oxy of course). Is this true with anyone else?",1413310258.0
