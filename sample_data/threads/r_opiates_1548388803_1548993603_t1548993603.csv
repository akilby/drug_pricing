He was from Florida and hitchhiked out here to Cali last week and I met him on his second day out here. He had a falling out with loved ones back home and he said he always wanted to visit Cali before he died.

I think it may have been a purposeful overdose. I'm not sure. But the way he talked sounded like a human being in mental turmoil. 

If you have someone you love fighting mental battles make sure you check on them. Let them know you love them.

Poppyseedgiraffe left his Reddit logged in on my phone so I thought it would be good to let the community know. I'm logging out of his page out of respect now. 

RIP and much love",1548992318.0
