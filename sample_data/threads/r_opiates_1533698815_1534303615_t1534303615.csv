with the m4's, i did the same thing, took half a bar and took a shot.. def felt that nice rush that i've been missing for so long.., but it never hit me like the 30's or a nice shot of dope would.. i never got the nods. 

i had bought 4, thinking they'd last me at least 2 days, but i ended up shooting 2 of them after like a 2 hour wait cuz i wasn't nodding, along with the rest of the bar. again i felt that really really nice rush, but still.. no actual nod.

finally at night i ended up taking the last one with 3/4 of a bar and finally felt a decent nod before i went to bed.

Is it worth IV this? He said ms the rush is comparable to coke, but somehow more intense. Should I smoke it? or IV it? I never IVed crack, just smoked. But in my head IV crack should be equal to cocaine, because is literally cocaine.

A gram is around $450aus or $325usd. I do not know anyone in person I can buy from either which means I’m at the mercy of the onion farmers.

I feel like I have no hope, and may as well try something extreme.  I think medications typically used for anxiety are bullshit, and they always end up making me feel worse in the long run.

Rufus and I tore into it every time we woke up from a nod. Worse than that though between the two of us, one would always brag about the quality. If he didn’t brag about how good our dope was to some poor street junkie cooking up the typical vinegary, black goo in the bottom half of a coke can or spoon on the sidewalk, then I did. We traded hits for packs of cigarettes or five bucks or meth we didn’t really want or pills we didn’t need. So, sooner than it should have been, it was gone.

The morning after it ran out we sat in the park and did some of the dilaudid and morphine we’d obtained. It was the last day of the month. We’d have food stamps to trade soon, but until then, we would be bored and wait for someone to come along with a lick for us to hit or something to pass the time. Soon enough, Black Irish walked up to us.

Now, Black Irish was neither black nor was he Irish, at least not so far as I could tell. He looked like a Nazi after the war who had let his hair grow out. Our interaction with him was always the same. He offered us rancid protein shakes in bottles he’d purchased at 42 cents a bottle from the discount grocery store, where a package of deli cut turkey breast might look more like a package of green roast beef. That was Black Irish’s thing. Well, it was one of his things.

He also liked to tell people how much he loved them. Sometimes, he would mix his proclamation of love towards you in with veiled threats to your safety, but he said it a lot. It was part of the Christian community he was in and out of it so frequently, a rehab church. He was a self-appointed leader there and disciple maker when he wasn’t relapsing. Eventually, he started saying that he’d been called to teach other men how to relapse and come back from it. Black Irish was always angry, walking around with two clenched fists like hammer heads and gritting his teeth, but out of some religious duty, he always told us he loved us. 

Rufus and I had just lit cigarettes. Black Irish stood at our feet looking down at us. He eyed our cigarettes and licked his lips. His fists clenched, and he said,

“Hey, guys. I love you.”

“Hey, Black Irish.” We responded trying to hide our disappointment in having to talk to him.

“How’s it going?”

“We’re doing alright.” I never asked him how he was.

“Good. I’m happy for you. Well, yeah, I’m doing pretty good myself.” I rolled my eyes. I didn’t want to know. “Just, you know, got back to my ministry at Hope Outreach downtown.”

“Yeah. We know where it is.”

“Good. Good. You guys should come down sometime. I sure do love you guys. Would love to see you come in and come to a service.” He grunted as the visceral hatred he held in his guts towards us tried to escape his mouth. “Really…really love you guys.”

“Maybe. Yeah. You know, what? That sounds nice. Maybe we’ll come see you there soon.” Rufus piped in.

“Okay! Looking forward to it.”

“Okay.”

“Hey. I have a pair of movie tickets here, but I can’t go to it. I've got work. Would you guys want to go see it?” Black Irish was always fasting from food or subjecting himself to humiliating employment as penance he decided God had decided for him to do. It never made sense. That’s how it was with him, though.

“Guess so. What is it?”

“Something about a mine in Alaska or something and women being mistreated there.”

“Jeesh. A lighthearted flick, huh?”

“Here.” He handed us the tickets. “Love you guys. See ya.”

“K. See ya.” Rufus said.

We walked up to the movie theater. The entrance was part of an outdoor plaza in the mall. There was a large grassy hill where people sat. Kids played with bouncy balls, and parents lay on blankets. Rufus busted out a sticky brown roach and lit it. He took a few puffs, blew the smoke up and passed it to me.

“Maybe we shouldn’t smoke here. There’s kids.”

“Nah..” He was holding the smoke in and talking. “Nah. Just smoke it. We’ll be done in a second.”

I shrugged. I took a few puffs. Before I could pass it back, I realized the smoke was blowing right towards the families and their kids. Rufus busted up in a fit of coughing. I followed, watery snot spraying out of my nose with the thick grey smoke plumes.  It burned like fire in the back of my nostrils.  We coughed hard. The parents of the children looked at us and shook their heads.

Eventually, we stopped coughing and walked into the theatre. A nerdy high school kid took our tickets and told us where the auditorium was. We had no money for soda and popcorn or any of that, but we did have a 200 milligram Kadian. Rufus and I went to the bathroom. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and took the cellophane off it. I opened the turquoise gel cap and poured the time release beads into the clear plastic that Rufus was holding open. He pulled out his lighter and crushed the beads against the stall divider. We poured the granulated powder into a cooker, dropped water on it and sucked it back up, half and half.

A flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came. We grunted simultaneously at the rush. I rubbed my face and capped my rig. It wasn’t a new one, so the needle got caught on the orange plastic cap and bent badly. Rufus watched it happen.

“Dang! Looks like that one’s spent.”

“Yeah. Huh? I’ve used worse.” There were at least six broken needles in my arms. There were seven before that. One had worked itself to the surface so that I could pick it out. The thing is that when they break and you try to grab them, your skin and fat pushes back up and swallows it before you can get it. I smiled and shrugged, dramatically throwing it into the toilet before I flushed it. We laughed and walked out.

In the theater, Rufus found a half-eaten box of popcorn that was cold and soggy. He also rounded up a few old beverages people left behind and mixed them together in the biggest cup. Rufus said it was flat and watery, maybe a mixture of Sprite, root beer and diet Coke. He wasn’t sure. But took long pulls of it through the straw between chewing the popcorn. The trailers started.

I always liked trailers more than movies. They were shorter. They were more action packed and emotionally stirring than the actual feature films. In high school, I realized that movies worth watching were few and far between. Movies didn’t do it for me. Most of the time, I was rooting for the good guys to fail and die so I could just go home and start mourning the $11.50 I’d wasted to see it as soon as possible. The sooner I started grieving it, the sooner I’d be over it.

Cinematic features had other problems, though, in my eyes. They were terribly unrealistic. And even when the storylines were relatable, I couldn’t stop thinking about how the actors were just acting. I’d heard about how partnerships or love stories on screen were actually terrible rivalries behind the scenes. They weren’t friends or in love. Like my life back when I used to go to the movies, before I went back to the streets, it was all fake. That was the most realistic thing about it. People pretended to be friends. They pretended to care. They pretended their lives mattered, and as I sat there watching that movie with Rufus, this was what I thought about. I didn’t have to worry about him being fake. He was broken like me. He stunk like me. He was filthy like me, but Rufus was also real. Rufus was my friend. He slept through the whole thing.

When we got out of the movie we walked up to see Ally Alcoholic. She was sitting on her bench. Rufus was getting sweet on her like he always did. He asked her if she had a clean, which she did. She gave it over, and we walked back to the spot to do whatever pill we decided to when we got there. It hit me then, the things I’d forgotten for over a week. I needed to break it to Rufus that he had to stop talking to her. I wondered how’d he take it. Would he accept it? He had to, or we’d be in big trouble. There was no second option. The Faceless One had ordered it.",1534282966.0
97cfzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/97cfzd/soo_last_week_i_got_kicked_out_of_rehab_for/,6,https://redd.it/97cfzd,mashnote,"Soo last week I got kicked out of rehab for withdrawing too hard. :| sent to jail, motion to revoke probation... anyone experienced something similar/have any idea what might happen to me?","Ok so. I'm hoping my fellow junkies here have maybe been in similar programs and have some idea of how this all might play out. Really if anyone can shed some light, any light, on this clusterf-k predicament... I'd be so grateful... Sorry about the wall of text, it's really a lot of details over a simple thing, just trying not to miss anything...

Last Nov I committed a serious crime for which I am genuinely remorseful. Drove drunk and crashed into an empty parked vehicle - no one was hurt thank god, and insurance covered property damage. This is my 2nd DWI; first was 8 years ago. I pled into ""DWI Court"" which is like a modified probation focused on I guess addiction recovery. It begins with a three month intensive outpatient program - group therapy 9 hours a week, going before the judge every week, etc... and of course random UAs. I have had a serious speedball addiction for a couple years now, so... I pissed dirty... 

They had me sign an agreement saying that I was not to use substances any more, and start having individual sessions with their assigned therapist in addition to everything else, and so on... Long story short I'm a complete idiot and piss dirty a second time at the end of the week. Come Monday my probation officer tells me to get to evening group early in order to drop another UA, because ""in light of the 2nd positive UA, the office will be making a recommendation to the judge, and if this UA comes out negative it will be one thing, if it comes positive it will be something else"". Welp that did it, 3rd positive UA...

So the next day I have court, got to go before the judge. Before court commences, the court officer pulls me aside for a private meeting. She tells me that because of what I'm dirty for (opiates), they're very worried about me. I start crying saying I don't want to be a criminal and I'm very sorry for my actions and want to do what it takes not to do something hurtful like that again (all true)... she tells me it's not even the criminal aspect they're concerned about at this point, it's my health and safety. Says they're referring me to the county-run rehab for a 5 month run. 

It's not too bad, I've had friends that have done it... it's a little similar to jail since it's county run but not even really, I mean the beds and uniforms are similar but the food is better, and super low security... you can technically leave out the door at any time, but it's an automatic state felony for ""absconding"" that carries 2 year sentence, and apparently the sheriffs usually find people in like an hour. My point is, it's better than jail and hey, I fucked up, and hey, I do need help with this addiction, so I was/am down.

So the court officer lady tells me they want me to check in by the following Monday, which is less than a week to get my affairs in order, and that basically if I refuse it would trigger a motion to revoke my probation/all kinds of bad stuff. Then she asked me if I was going to need to be referred to a detox facility first, or at least that's how interpreted her questions at the time, about if I expected to get very very sick. She definitely at least made it clear that they did not expect me to be able to drop this habit on my own, that they did expect me to be detoxing at first. And I said, yeah you're right, and I do expect to get sick, but I don't think it will be anything life-threatening.

Ok. So. I check in to the rehab. Part of my intake was signing a bunch of forms, one of which listed the ""rights"" I have, which included going to the hospital when I want. It was also made clear to me that upon checking in to the rehab, I was switching to a new probation officer that works there at the rehab. I am immediately completely honest with the nurses about my use, expected withdrawal, etc, and with the doctor that examined me the first morning. The girl in the bunk under me is kicking way harder than I am, and I come to learn that she did go to the hospital one of her peak days. 

Anyway, the nurses give me OTC stuff twice a day for my symptoms, Imodium Ibuprofen etc., but it's rough. Come day 3, my dormies are pressuring me to ask to go to the hospital, saying I really don't look good etc. So I do, and the staff basically say they are ""working on it"" for THREE HOURS... my dormies keep telling me it's a violation of my rights and that they got sent right away on request, etc. So they kinda start pressuring the staff on my behalf... three hours later the staff take me to a back room saying all of a sudden that someone needs to be with me at all times, and then finally to another back room, my new PO's office, where I meet my new PO for the first time. Two cops there as well. My new PO tells me there has been a warrant issued for my arrest and that they will be taking me to jail after the ER.

Why? Because ""this facility is not equipped to take care of you. Jail is. This is not a detox facility."" Says that after I'm done detoxing at jail for one or two weeks, I will be returned to the rehab. I'm freaking tf out, saying I don't understand, that I've tried to follow all the rules and be honest and that this is not what I was told before, and that why if the other girls are kicking harder and went, etc... she just says every case is different and that in my case this is what the court ordered. 

The ER gave me a weak Ativan prescription which did follow me to jail, thank god, and to my immense surprise, the next morning the judge DID set a bond for me?! So my BF bails me out. I would've thought they wouldn't let me leave since I was supposed to be finishing my detox there and then return to rehab? But apparently my official ""status"" now is full-blown Motion to Revoke Probation. Guys I am freaking tf out. If I get my probation revoked I could be looking at 180 days in jail to my understanding. My attorney doesn't even understand what happened; he and my family and everyone is basically assuming that I MUST have broken a rule or committed a crime to get a MTRP, he was asking me if I had brought drugs, etc. 

I did have two auxiliary thoughts occur to me. 1) I overheard a conversation right before they took me away to arrest me, where the girl who was kicking hard and went to the hospital, was complaining that someone had ""snitched"" on her for apparently having her dealer meet her at the hospital and using while she was there. So I wonder if that affected how they dealt with me? and, 2) the hospital staff were saying that my readings were actually ok and that my kick wasn't that bad, but it sure felt bad to me, and so I wonder if I was having a panic attack essentially. I had told my therapist in the outpatient program that I have panic attacks ever since my father got charged with four felonies and might spend his life in prison and I've been managing his affairs, and that I was just about to start a Xanax script for my symptoms before I pled into DWI court which does not allow any narcotic meds even prescribed. I wonder if they might consider this anxiety disorder as a mitigating factor.

My next court date is in a week and my attorney thinks I should check in to a 30 day private rehab to kind of do what they wanted me to do, and that he could ""probably"" get the court date pushed back if I did that and use it as a selling point to not revoke my probation. But he also works in a different county and admits he has no idea how this system here works, he's just guessing that would be an option. But I suspect it might ""have"" to be the state-run one... I'm meeting with a local attorney that DOES have experience handling DWI's HERE in this county, tomorrow.

But in the meantime I am still panicking. And yes, using. \*\*I'm not asking for legal advice,\*\* I just want to know if anyone has seen anything remotely similar to this go down, or just if anyone has anything to say at all about this bizarre situation. 

\*\*TLDR:\*\* 2nd DWI, pled into DWI court including IOP, dropped dirty UAs, got referred to state-run rehab and told it would be ok to detox there, got sent to jail from state-run rehab for kicking too hard, now my probation is in ""motion to revoke"" status, freaking tfffff out.",1534282651.0

I do know that because of insurance and  FDA she can't write the same strength again. 

My refill is DUE (28 Days) next Friday. They want to see me THIS Friday due to them being closed next week. She said doc would give me a post-dated script. 

This is my last insurance approved visit as I lost my insurance in 4 weeks. 

I have no opiates in my system. 

I was given dilaudid at the ER for a serious stomach issue. She'll be able to see that. 

I currently test positive for THC but I can get completely clean piss.

As I can assume from the posts on the front page you guys are, as you call yourselves, ""opiate enthusiasts""!

Regardless, I would guess some of you guys ~~(maybe most?)~~ have been in contacts with **people in higher up-positions like** the police, maybe even jail, people working at different institutes, social workers and so forth. (edited because worded badly and to be fair insulting, I'm sorry)


I work at a treatment home where the clients are there by their own will while undergoing a sort of replacement therapy for opioid dependence, which means they are on either Buprenorphine or Methadone which is given to them daily while undergoing therapy. 

These guys are mostly ""ex"" criminals in that sense they're not actively doing criminal activity right now. Most of them have gone to criminality to sustain their high use of all kind of substances, mostly opiates. 

Even though they are there by their free will and driven to stay drug-free for reasons like they have kids, they are afraid to die etc., having relapses and not returning to treatment is very usual. Most of the time when they have relapses it's because of anxiety of some sort.

My question to you guys is how can I as a social worker be better at understanding their feelings to mostly opiates and help them in their own will to be drug-free? 

Is it something you'd like to ask me, teach me, etc., feel free, I will try to answer and listen to you all.

Thanks in advance!",1534275472.0

Whether you ran out suddenly or it is planned, it **SUCKS** either way. I want you all to hit me with your best tips for getting through that period of time that seems like death. 




##I am mainly looking for tips that deal with: 

**•Nutrition:** how do you keep fed while puking/shitting your guts out? Any specific foods or brands that you SWEAR by that you want on hand if you have a say in the matter?
 
** -** do you utilize vitamin pills/supplements or the like to help maintain nutrition levels? 
How about so-called ""natural remedies""?

**•Comfort:** how do you get through the kicking legs, the horrible body aches and the relentless yawning and tears?

**•The Endless and Incessant Thoughts:** be this the mind numbing boredom, the horrible fiend crave or the deep pit of depression that accompanies the lack of drug. 

***


I am mainly looking for things you can do that do NOT require being given another scrip or drug. 
* This can include if you all feel helped especially by legal CBD and Kratom but they need to **be able to be procured from a store in your neighborhood, not necessarily the internet or illegal means.** *

* Specifically, I don't want to keep hearing to go to the doc to get benzos or methadone or subs or just get weed because let's get real, it just doesn't always work that way. (I will concede to weed but because it isn't legal everywhere, it isn't always the most viable. And yes I do realize that most of our withdrawal are caused by illegal drugs). *

Legal, SAFE, proven tips are mainly what I'm looking for.  Hit me with them and be safe out here friends!

(Apologize for formatting, mobile.)

Edit:
I am aware that this is a topic that is pretty widely touched on already here in this sub but I guess I was looking for a little something more, information wise. The general things that are done to make the time easier are pretty well known but I guess I'm looking more for what YOU as an individual find helps you the most. Are there specific brands you go to? Specific exercises and activities you find help ease the ordeal? I have utilized search and very much appreciate the guides but I was hoping to hear more personal experience. Believe me, I've been there and done it. Clean for almost 6months now but there are some aspects about the process that I'm looking to flesh out and gain knowledge over.

My ears began to ring and my vision went black. I couldn’t breathe, like I had just gotten the wind knocked out of me. I could tell Amy was trying to get me up but I was no longer there, my spirit had vanished. 

Reality forced itself back onto me, no matter how much I didnt want to let it back in. My stomach churned and bubbled and I could taste that watery taste that always precedes that kind of throwing up that doesnt feel good when its over. When I was a drinker, during life before opiates, I could remember being drunk and welcoming a good puke, sometimes even forcing it. 

This was different. I felt my cold sweat get hot, my forehead dripping big syrupy drops into my clammy palms where it rested. 

“Are you ok Slim? Slim, talk to me!” Amy demanded. I looked up at her and then back at the pavement. 

As I began to open my mouth, I was planning to try and tell her I was ok. Instead I vomitted onto the pavement where I was kneeling, splashing black bile and stomach acid onto my knees and hoodie sleeves. And then I was lost, puking over and over, so hard and with such fury I couldnt even stop to try and inhale, and I began to suffocate as my bodily functions betrayed me. I would gasp and cough and snot would shoot out of my nostrils. My eyes were crying, not that I was crying for the lost $40, or the fact I had been disowned by the only family I had left willing to put up with me, or the fact I was kneeling in snow and ice and now puke and stomach acid, with no home and no friends I trusted. I was crying because I was vomiting so hard the pressure was forcing all of the fluid in my head out. 

When it finally was over, Amy was whimpering, tears in her eyes. 

“I am so sorry.” she said, and crouched over me from behind, wrapping her arms around me. 

“I really cant believe he did that.”

.....

Jeff was from Atlanta, by way of Haiti. He had the darkest skin I have ever seen on a black man, and his dreads were long. He wasn’t anywhere near as tall as me, but he had that kind of frame that I knew meant he could probably murder someone with his bare hands, if he had good reason to do so.

I had heard about him from Amy, and then again from Matt when I sat on the filthy wood floor in his tiny room, smoking cigarettes and just being happy I wasnt outside in the snow. 

“Bro, he came down here last weekend and we sat in this room for like 36 hours, doing nothing but getting fucking GEEKED!” Matt said, smiling and throwing a fist in the air in triumph. 

“No bullshit he had like a quarter of soft, maybe more, and we smoked the whole shit.” Matt said, lighting another Marlboro red. 

“Who chef’ed it though?” I asked, hoping I might find an opportunity to use my most prized skill. I had learned to cook crack cocaine in Richmond. Sure, like everyone else, I had first tried to learn to cook crack from the internet, googling and reading different TEKs and watching youtube videos. Cocaine is expensive. Cooking it into crack so it could be smoked required experience and skill, and it was easy to fuck it up. I had personally ruined at least a few grams trying to learn. Sometimes it came out ok, smokeable at least. Sometimes it was a complete loss, depending on the quality of the powder. So when one of my boys from Richmond had began to use my kitchen to cook his shit, I kept asking him to teach me. At first, he refused. He would call me, usually about once a week, and say “Yo I need to use the kitchen.” 

“Ok, come through, Im here.” I would reply, excited to get the crack he would give me for letting him do his thing in my house. The first couple of times he came over and cooked, I tried to nonchalantly watch him, but he would turn around and say “Yo please dont crowd me bro, I’ll be done in a minute.” I thought about and realized that I would probably want to be left alone too, since he was in the process of converting his $900 investment into $1800, and if he fucked it up, it would be a catastrophic financial loss. The more I thought about it, I began to change how I behaved around him when he was there to cook. I started keeping the kitchen clean all the time, instead of leaving dirty dishes all in the sink and on the counters. When he came over the 3rd and 4th time to cook, I had the water in the pot simmering, the pyrex clean and dry, fresh unopened boxes of Arm & Hammer on the counter, next to a clean knife, spoon, and fork I had flattened. 

He noticed these preparations and then one day he showed up and said “You are going to help me this time, you cool with that?” 

Learning how to cook cocaine is not done overnight. Sure, the process isnt too complicated: you add sodium bicarbonate to cocaine hydrochloride, usually in a ratio of about 1:3, then some water, which you heat until the bicarbonate reacts with the cocaine and begins to bond to it. Once the reaction is about done, you remove the heat, let it cool, and remove the new crack cocaine from the water, let it dry, and its ready to smoke. 

But there were so many variables. How much baking soda to add depended on the quality of the cocaine powder. How much had the cocaine powder been cut, and what adulterants had been added was a major variable as well. Learning to identify the quality of cocaine powder required experience and knowing what to look for. Was the cocaine powder still hard and in chunks, or “blocked up” as I called it, or was it just a bag of powder, like a ziploc full of flour? Did it have a shine to it, little crystals that reacted to the light? If it was blocked up, did it have a grain when you broke a piece off, like a slab of granite, or was it repress, which meant someone had cut it already and then put it in a hydraulic press and squeezed it back together, making it appear to be higher quality than it was. The cocaine game, like most of the drug game, is complex and dynamic, and people were always trying to find new and innovative ways to make more money.

I learned all these skills and nuances, just like any apprentice shadowing a mastered artist, during my time in Richmond. My boy that taught me to cook ended up becoming one of my closest friends, and he taught me so much about the game and life in general. When I moved back up north, I gave him my favorite possession, a digital jewelers scale that measured accurately to the thousands, 3 digits to the right of the 0. 

“I want you to make a million dollars with this, Fortune 5000” I said when I handed it to him, using the nickname I had given him. Cooking crack was something I did better than anyone else I had ever met since I had left Richmond, better even than the d boys I met in the projects or on the block in New Bedford. I was Heisenberg of that crack shit. 

“Slim can cook like a mad scientist” Amy said to Matt. “You gotta see my bro in action.”

“Really?” Matt said, looking a bit puzzled. “Dude can you show me? Because I suck at it. I mean I can do it, but I dunno, its like its always a little bit off, I only get lucky and get it right every once in a while.”

“Sounds like you probably use too much water” I said, snubbing out my cigarette in the ash tray. “Its easy to cook, but its not easy to do it the right way every time. I can help you though, I’d be happy to.”

“Sweet!” Matt squeaked in excitement. “Im gonna text Jeff now, see whats up.” 

A few minutes passed, and then Jeff replied to Matt’s text. He was working, and woudnt be home til late that night. I asked Matt “Do you have any money? I mean I can call someone if you want, thats no probem.” I was hoping he did, cause I needed to make every penny I could, and any chance to middle man a package meant I would profit in some way. It did not matter the drug, the amount, or the circumstances around the transaction. I could out-hustle anyone, I was a scorpion, cold, calculated, and dangerous when I needed to be. I kept a box of sandwich bags, a box of baking soda, a bottle of miralax, and a bottle of benefiber in my backpack with me, 24/7. I was always prepared to cook, cut, and bag up. It was how I survived. 

“No, no money, but Im telling you bro, Jeff has a shitload of coke. He had a fucking black trash bag of it when he walked in here this weekend.”

I would come to find out much later, that Jeff was perpetrating a huge lie to everyone he met. He talked about being “plugged in”, and because he was from ATL, most people just assumed he must have been what he claimed to be. He claimed he got his bricks in the mail every month. He claimed he was connected to Meech and BMF. He claimed he had a fucking arsenal of guns. What I ended up learning much later that summer, was that Jeff was a pathological liar and a bullshit artist, a fraud so full of shit his eyes were brown. He wasnt getting anything in the mail but past-due bills, definitely not kilos of cocaine. He did have a trashbag full of cocaine that one weekend like Matt said, and they did smoke around a half ounce, like 14 grams, but he only had it because he had robbed an actual drug dealer at gun point that same night he walked into Matts room pretending he was Scarface. 

But I didnt know this yet. In my mind, I was thinking I had just found a reason to hope I would be cooking and smoking coke very soon, probably even finding an opportunity to shoot some powder, and I was already imagining the joyous rush of cocaine I hoped Id be having sometime in the very near future.

Matt and Amy kept insisting I meet Jeff, and I eventually did. The house Matt lived in was a boarders house about a 5 minute walk from the Hyannis Bus Terminal. It had around 6 different bedrooms that were rented by the month, a shared kitchen and a few shared bathrooms. Matts room was on the first floor in the back, and had a seperate door to the outside, which was cool. Jeffs room was upstairs, through the main entrance, and was flanked by a room on each side, one of which was vacant. When I met Jeff, Amy and I went up to his room with him, and we talked and bullshitted while he told me about himself and his connections. He said he had been born in Haiti, that much was obvious, and that his mother had abandoned him in the hospital as a newborn, to go back to the streets of Haiti and her crack addiction. He was quick to point out he was a crack baby. He was adopted by his grandmother, who lived in ATL, and moved there when he was 10. Then at some point his mother also moved to ATL, and he moved in with her. I will never forget him telling me how his mother had ashtrays overflowing with crack stems like an ashtray full of cigarette butts. I could only feel sorrow and empathy for him when he told me that, I knew what that meant. I felt a little pang of guilt for being raised by parents that didnt smoke coke or shoot dope, even if they were divorced and my childhood was traumatic. 

Jeff wasnt all bad. He was just a con artist. I eventually figured his whole hustle out, just like I do with anyone I spend any real time with. He would claim, like he did with me that night, that he had never smoked crack, that he only had ever just sniffed coke. I had some coke, and I cooked it in a spoon on his coffee table while he watched me with the focus of a hawk. I could tell he was shocked and impressed when I flicked a yellow boulder out onto the lotto ticket on the table to dry, looking up to smile at him. 

“That’ll put some hair on your chewing gum” I said, in the best Early Cuyler voice I could muster.

“Damn that does look pretty good” Jeff said. “I dont know though, I aint never smoked that shit before, I’m not sure I should”

“You absolutely shouldnt” I said, and I meant it. “You do at your own peril, trust me my dude. You shouldnt ever take the panties of this bitch. I’ll give you some powder if you wanna sniff. I just wanted to show you I can chef. I dont want to turn you out.”

“Fuck it” Jeff said, grabbing a stem and bringing it his lips. “I want to see what this is all about”.

So Jeffs hustle was that he pretended he had never smoked crack before. People were always generous with someone smoking coke their first time, he had figured that out and was exploiting it. 

I tell you about Jeff for a good reason. 

Jeff and I became cool, and he knew I was homeless. He looked out for me on a few occasions, telling me I could sleep in the vacant room next to his. I had to leave by 6am, and it was just an empty room, but it was shangra la compared to being hunched over in some bando too cold and too scarred to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time. I would take my hoodie off, fold it up, lay it on top of my backpack, and kind of lean against it in a half reclined half laid down position. I would wake up and my legs would be numb, my back screaming at me, but when your homeless you come to appreciate things others would claim intolerable. I wasnt comfortable, but I was safe and warm. You also learn what it means to be truly grateful when you are on the streets. Jeff barely knew me, but letting me crash in that room put him at risk because it could end up coming back on him if I was caught, or caught the house on fire, or refused to leave when 6am came. I always made sure to thank him and I never got caught or fucked up his situation. 

So anyway, one night, probably about a month after Sean jumped in the Honda and left me to die on the sidewalk that day, Jeff and I were sitting on the front porch his house, me smoking newport reds, him smoking a blunt. It was dark out, probably like 10pm, and we were just bullshitting when all of a sudden, we see a figure appear in the street, walking slowly towards us. As the walking figure got within eyesight, I immediately recognized who it was, someone I hadnt seen for a long time, no matter how much I had looked and asked others where he was. 

It was Sean, the same pony tailed greasy sack of shit that had looked me in the eyes promising me relief only to leave me to die in the street. 

“Jeff, stay right here, I gotta go handle something” I whispered, standing up out of the wooden Adirondack chair. 

“Where you going nigga?” Jeff asked in his strong drawl, half Haitian and half southern.

“I gotta go do this thing real quick” I said, as I walked down off the porch towards Sean. 

Sean looked at me coming towards him and immediately I saw terror on his face. I went into my pocket for the boxcutter I had, and I heard him say “Ohhhh shiiiiit” but after that I went black.

I came to, hand covered in blood, standing over Sean writhing around on the pavement, and realized what I had down. 

“My face!!! My fucking face!!!” Sean screamed, clutching at the piece of cheek hanging from his jaw. 

“Shut the fuck up you little bitch or I’ll give the other buck fifty and make it a whole 3 dollars” I seethed. “You really thought you wouldnt ever see me again? Your lucky I dont open up your windpipe and let you leak out on GP. Pick your shit up and get the fuck out my face, and dont ever cross my path again or I might finish what I started on you.” 

This wasnt me. I dont know who the person speaking out of my mouth was, but I didnt protest much either. I was due some payback, some actual balancing of the karmic scales. Sean had robbed me of my last $40, and he did it in a way that was cowardly and disgusting. He could have shorted my bag and gotten over on me, but I still would have gotten well and it would have been nothing more than another drug deal. Instead, I later learned that the boys he called who he absconded with that day didnt even HAVE DOPE. They only hustled coke. Sean was NEVER planning to help me, he was going to beat me from the jump.

Sean picked himself up off the ground just as Jeff came off the porch scolding me. “What the fuck wrong with you Slim. Now the fucking feds gon be here, you better hope this white boy dont call police. I dont need this kind of heat my nigga, you gotta relax.” 

“Bro this that bitch that beat me when I was on my death bed, remember I told you a while back about it. Fuck all that police shit, he knows better.” Sean immediately mumbled “Im not gonna call proliceeee” and the 3 of us all realized at that moment, that Sean's mouth and his speech were fucked up from the laceration reaching from his ear to his lip crease. 

“Just go, faggot” I said, as the guilt started creeping in. I never was violent by nature. I abhorred hurting people, to be honest. But I had learned as a young man, sometimes others leave you no choice. Not acting would be like saying “its ok to hurt me”. So I did what the fuck needed to be done.

I for one would take a fentanyl pressed roxi over a real one any day.  I used them everyday for six months until i decided id had enough and got on subs.  But the rush is absolutely amazing (sniffed) the only downsides to me are that they make me want to compulsively redose similar to cocaine and they destroy your tolerance. Also the withdrawal is absolutely hell even with 24 mg of bupe. But the price is super affordable compared to basically any other opioid which makes it that much easier to support the habit and get the bills paid. Anyone else love the fentanyl?,1534264798.0

I’ve been really curious to try oxy without Tylenol in it but I have no clue as to where to find something like that.  I traded a friend some xans for an M30 pill and I swallowed 1/4 of it and smoked my vape oil pen.  I’ve done opioids before but the strongest I’ve ever taken is the Oxycodone 512 pills.  I’ve never been so relaxed in my life.  A few things I wasn’t expecting:

1) How long it lasted and how delayed the response was: I took it at 9pm and I didn’t really feel it until 10:30pm.  By 2am, I was peaking and it’s now 9:30am 

2) How itchy I got and how amazing it felt to scratch. Is that normal or is this an allergic reaction?

A twin mattress faced a tiny TV that had to be from the early 1990’s. The bed sheets were mismatched and had human hair on them. The blanket was filthy. I slept in my clothes on the top of the bed.

It was late March, and it had snowed again the night before. I woke up shivering, chilled to the bone, incapable of getting my body temperature to rise. There was no heat in the room, no way to warm up. I attempted to take a hot shower as a last resort but the shower didn’t work. 
The motel room had been paid for by a clinic I had been getting my suboxone from. I had called my counselor/doctor there the day I became homeless and had told him what happened. He had put me in touch with another counselor there and she had gotten me the room for 3 nights. Checkout was in 4 hours.

I decided it made no sense to sit in the room til 10:30am. I was homeless and about to be on the street in the winter, 6 inches of snow on the ground, 35 degrees in the day, 25 and sometimes 10 at night. My fate had been decided. I was facing a world I had never been in, and I was truly afraid. 

Ok so I haven’t told you everything yet. Being homeless was already terrifying and dangerous, but I also had another problem, a major one. I was out of suboxone, had $40 to my name, and I was beginning to get really sick. Being dope sick in the warmth and safety of your own home was intolerable, so the prospect of being dope sick on the street in freezing cold weather with nowhere to go was about the closest thing to hell on earth I could imagine. So I decided to leave the motel room and get to the block. Maybe I could find someone with dope for sale. I had $40 which would get me at least enough heroin to keep me well for the day into the night, if I was smart about how much I did. I just had to find someone to buy from. 
I walked out of the motel room wearing the only clothes I had: a grey winter beanie on my head, a grey hoodie (hood up), a pair of dark blue jeans, my black tactical backpack, and a pair of camouflage air max. 

I trekked through the snow across the street and headed down to the bus station where almost always a few street kids or homeless drunks could be found. I’d driven by them a million times, now I was one of them. I wondered if they would accept me or if I would be shunned. I wondered if I’d end up dead in some bando with a blade buried in my ear, pockets pulled out of my jeans like rabbit ears. I wondered about my future. 

Around 8am I saw Amy, and she immediately knew what kind of shape I was in:

“You look like shit bro. Do you need a sub?”

“No, fuck subs, I need dope.” I said, stubbornly.

“Babe just take a sub - you will feel better and not waste your money” she countered, and she was right. 

“Nah I want to get dope sis. It gotta be dope. I’m fucking homeless out here in March. I stayed clean for 2 months for nothing. I’m not gonna be on the street and not use.
I need to get on and leave the disaster that has become my life behind for a while.”

“Ok hun I understand but if you decide you want a sub just tell me. But I’m sure we can find you something, how much do you have?”

“$40, and I want at least a .4” 

“Yea ok lets go over to the Jamaican store and see who we bump into”

Amy and I had met a few days before, and she had taken on the role of defacto street Mom to me. When she introduced me to other people on the street, she would say:

“And this is my brother Slim. Oh you didn’t know I had a brother? Yup, he just got out of prison.”

I had watched her closely as she had taken me under her wing me in the previous 3 days. I had the motel room those first 3 nights. Now I was truly homeless. At first I suspected she was just trying to set me up for a quick lick, like trying to see if I was worth anything, if I had anything she wanted, etc. But she had been nothing but genuine and compassionate to me, so I was starting to trust her.
As we walked to the Jamaican store, Amy asked everyone we bumped into if they knew where we could find some dope. It made no sense really. Any other day there were 50 people around with heroin for sale. I ended up needing it the one morning of the month that nobody had anything. Then just as we arrived at the store, we bumped into Sean.
I had seen Sean a few times before, and he always had the same clothes on: Black sweat pants, raggedy white new balance sneakers, a black Boston College sweatshirt and his slick black hair, pulled into a pony tail. I had actually met him once when I had been staying at the hotel with the jacuzzis in the rooms, partying with a couple girls. I was walking through the hotel hallways looking for an ice machine and I came across him, down in the back hallway of the hotels bowels. I spoke to him briefly, later realizing he was basically squatting down there, probably because he had no where else to go.
Amy flagged Sean down and told him what the situation was. 

“Yeah I can get that for you right now, what did you need?” he asked.

“Look man, Im going to make this simple for you. I don’t let my bread walk. So it’s like this: you can bring your people to me and I transact with them, or you can put your money up for it and then sell it to me. But you ain’t taking my cash and dipping, leaving me to wait for you to come back.”

“Bro I totally understand, I absolutely get it”.

“Man I’m not trying to be a dick, it’s just I am sick as fuck, I’m getting worse, and this is the last $40 I got so I have to get straight or I’m gonna be fucked”

He looked me straight in my eyes and said “listen man, I’ve been there. I’ve been sick like you are, I’m not going to do that to you. I know how it feels to be that sick, I couldn’t do that to you”
 
“Ok so how do we do this?” I asked him.

Before he could answer, Amy jumped in front of him and said “Sean don’t fuck around. This is my brother. If you do any dirty shit I swear to god I will hunt you down and I will cut you.” 

Sean paused and looked at Amy for a moment, and then blurted out “Amy I know you are crazy I’m not stupid ok, believe me I know.”

At this point I was starting to think Sean would play fair. I told him I would break off a piece of dope for him if my package was correct, and I planned to do just that. Being stingy in the street, homeless or not, is ill advised. Felony favors aren’t free. 
Sean made a phone call, and then proceeded to explain what was going to happen.

“Ok so my dude is on the way here. When he pulls up I will go to his car with your cash and grab it from him through his window, then walk right back to you. I’ll never leave your sight.”

“No bro, I told you, my money doesn’t walk.” At that same moment I could feel the withdrawal symptoms beginning to go into overdrive. I had maybe 30 minutes before I would be incapable of controlling my bowels anymore, and once I took that first shit, what I call “breaking the seal”, I would be vacating my bowels for the next 4 hours, eventually squirting diarrhea to the point that my asshole would burn from passing so much shit and acidic stomach bile. I was beginning to panic on the inside, knowing that if this thing I was trying to do with Sean didn’t work out I was gonna be in real trouble. It was fucking freezing out, but I was soaked in cold sweat. My nose was pouring clear snot. My eyes were running, my muscles starting to burn and ache. 

Sean made another call, and then looked at me and said “yo my dude don’t want to meet new people so it’s either I take your money to him or it can’t happen”. I looked at Amy, and she said “I think you can trust him. If he does anything, he knows I’m gonna cut him from ear to ear.” 
Now normally, in this situation, I always stood my ground. I refuse to let people take my money and buy for me; if I can’t handle the business then we can’t do business. But I was desperate. He seemed sincere. Amy made me feel like Sean understood the dire repercussions he would face if he took off with my cash. So against my better judgement I agreed to let Sean walk to the car with my last $40. 
When the car pulled up, it drove past us on the sidewalk and stopped about 10 yards away. I handed Sean the 2 twenty dollar bills from my pocket and watched him as he walked to the car. 
He immediately opened the rear door behind the driver. Ok, I thought, he’s gonna get in to transact. Maybe dudes window was up. 
He pulled the car door closed and the next thing I heard was him saying “Yo GO GO GO!!!” And with that I watched my money drive away in a late model teal Honda Accord, two Dominican kids from providence in front, Sean in back, turned around looking at me to see if I was going to try to chase.
I lifted my hand and made a pistol with my fingers, pointed it at him, and made the “Bang” motion. 
The car turned fast and hard around the corner and was gone.

So I made a purchase from a reputable online vendor recently. I usually purchase Afghan #4 but after trying some really good street tar I decided I wanted to find an online tar vendor. I found one who advertises their product as gun powder but everyone in reviews and other places mentioned it is actually tar, though a very good quality tar. 

When I received package this stuff was in a bag but looked super dry almost crusty brown looking, texture of wood, matte finish. When I took it out of the bag, it immediately started soaking up humidity from the air and turned into the the blackest tar I’ve seen yet. Not super sticky but u could tell it was tar as before it looked weird. Now the thing that is tripping me out is the smell. It smells completely different than the vinegar smell I know and love from street tar. I do not shoot up, I usually do monkey water in a spray bottle or turn to cheese. But this stuff smells so bad/unique that I wonder if this is cut with something or maybe it has something added to it to turn into that wood consistency for easy shipping or to pass off as gun powder? Figured if anyone knew what was up it would be you guys. I tried some last night, only 0.02 to test it out as it is supposed to be really strong but I didn’t feel much just fell asleep. I would really appreciate the help. Thanks guys and gals. ",1534255668.0

I would never waste narcan and I certainly don't have any interest in undoing the effects of my oxy or morphine but hypothetically what would happen if someone was decently high (but not OD'ing) and took the naloxone spray? Would it immediately undo the high? Would there be any other side effects?

Sorry if this is a dumb question, I just couldn't find anything definitive on Google and I've been pondering this for a few days now...",1534242327.0

(I need you all to know that I’m not an opiate user or addict.  Like the rest of us, though, my drug of choice has always been “more”.)  I’ve been saddled with treatment-resistant clinical depression for about 20 years now, and this last week has been quite bad; I’ve basically been holed up in my room for the majority of the time.  The reading & identifying have helped me to stay (relatively) sane, and so I want to thank all of you for all that you say & share.  (I’m also a drunk & drug addict in recovery, thank my maker.)

Often, when I’m quite depressed, I struggle to put cogent thoughts together, and can have difficulty writing well, which is extraordinarily frustrating for me.  That said, I’ll do my best here.

It might be tempting for some to think that I’m treating my pain by marveling at the misery of others, but I am truly not a sadist, nor do I ever take any joy in the sorrow of another soul.  It would be more accurate to say that I find it comforting to be among my kind.   Drunks, junkies, stoners, freaks, those with one sort of mental illness or another...  it’s been my experience that we all have lived a certain special type of agony that cannot be adequately explained on the written page, or by the spoken word.  (We’ve long since stopped trying to explain this kind of thing to the layman.)

As I read the various posts & stories, I see myself in each of them.  From the seeming-and-fleeting happiness in the early years of my using, to the untold hell of an addicted life, to the yearning for recovery while achieving none, to finally getting & living clean.   I’m reading it all from each of you, and it’s all me too.

It seems that my depression is a demon which may have reeked more pain & destruction on my life than any other, over the years.  This is the one demon from which I simply have not been able to achieve significant, sustained recovery.  I do honestly wonder if I ever will.  On nights like tonight, I do a lot of doubting.

Finally, two years ago, I was sponsoring a new kid in the deal who was about 90 days clean.  Rob, a recovering heroin addict.  I loved that kid.  He was me when I got sober.   He was just like me.   We worked together for weeks.  And then one single day passed without him calling me, as he always did. The next day, I got the call.  Yeah, that one.  Done.  One shot.  Over.   I was absolutely devastated.

I don’t want that to be me today, and I don’t want it to be you either.  But it’s gonna be somebody.  That’s just the fucked up reality of this thing.  Because of being able to read what you say, I’m just a little better tonight than I would otherwise have been, and I thank you all for that most sincerely.  Similarly, all of you continue to help, protect, encourage & save each other by saying & sharing all that you do.

I may not necessarily have a lot to offer, but I feel strongly compelled to express my thanks.

So now to the weird part. All I want is someone to be with that can enjoy the lifestyle I lead which is pretty much just getting high, working, occasionally going out with friends, and occasionally traveling. But it’s like there are no men out there who want some girl that is on heroin and is happy being on heroin. Maybe I’ve just watched too many movies (Requiem, Candy, Heaven Knows What, etc.) that romanticize the experience of being in love and in a relationship while also on dope together, or maybe it’s just too much to ask. I cannot for the life of me figure it out. 

I’ve been in 2 different relationships where me and my boyfriend at the time we’re on dope and I loved those relationships. It just seems like I haven’t been able to find another one that will actually last longer than a couple months.

What movies or documentaries do you guys like to delve into. I love when i discover a new YouTube documentary series and dive down the rabbit hole. I'm more a factual documentary guy myself, out of all I've watched I still find stuff that covers more than I've seen before. Not one can capture the entire picture. 

One of my favorites is Drugs Inc. Which I believe originally aired on discovery. It goes in depth following the cops side as well as the user side. Some episodes highlight a specific drug while others will highlight a certain city. 

Another one is Hamiltons Pharmocopia and a lot of the other stuff Vice does, which is alot of times flawed but good first hand journalism.

Where I am from, in most disabled public toilets there is a cord hanging next to the wall that people pull if they get into trouble. If using and in a rush on the go, I always use the disabled toilet. I quickly tie the cord to my other arm and sit on the toilet. Should anything go wrong, I will fall off the toilet thus pulling the cord.

At home, I get the chance to test my dope/use smaller amounts etc etc. On the go with a new cop, this isn’t possible. This gives me piece of mind whilst remaining completely stealth.

My diagnosis is post laminectomy syndrome with arachnoiditis and bilateral radiopathy. Conservative methods like epidurals, PT, spinal cord stim, non-opioid pain killers do not work to control my pain.  Doctor after doctor is dropping their opioid patients, finding them too big a risk to their license.  The last doctor to discharge me admitted opioids were appropriate for me (I was in compliance, no increases in dose, no alternative treatments, etc) but fears all the crackdowns happening.

I am about to try and find a new pain doc, just want to figure out some of the puzzling behavior of my last doctor and his PA.  The pain doc was pressuring me to get epidurals and other procedures already demonstrated and fully documented to make my condition worse (all the epidurals caused arachnoiditis.)  He also seemed angry I wouldn’t pay $9K out of pocket for a procedure because my insurance won’t cover it (considered experimental.)  The procedure offered little relief in the past anyway, barely above what might be the placebo effect (RFA.)  His PA was constantly pressuring me to report I was in less pain than I actually was.  If I didn’t cave to their pressures, they made indications they would discharge me.  I was eventually discharged when I asked my doctor to fill out forms to activate my temporary disability insurance.  

As I was discharged while in compliance, I am not sure what to tell the next pain management doc.  I need this stuff to live, without I am in so much pain I am bed-ridden and constantly contemplating suicide- not in a depressed way, just in a escaping misery kind of way.  I am by no means an addict, I am a responsible father and husband with good ties to the community.  While other opioids do make me high, the hydrocodone I am on does not impair me (or give me feeling of euphoria) even at the high dose i’m on (80 mg total a day.)

Is anyone out there that can provide me with insights into pain doctor’s minds.  Why are they pressuring me in ways that are counter to my care?  How should I respond so that I can attain a high standard of care for my condition?

I wish I didn’t need opioids to live.  Life had become so hard since the new regulations, life has been absolute hell.  Before anyone asks, I have an odd brain chemistry.  Weed makes me psychotic, so does ultram (makes me have violent and suicidal impulses.)  Not willing to take illegal drugs.

96zpx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96zpx6/broken/,15,https://redd.it/96zpx6,PillMomThrow,Broken.,"Previously I've written about things which only a small handful of people would be able to identify me with. I guess it's time to change that. To anyone reading this who knew me in high school, I guess hi. To the kid who fucked up my life, I'm fairly certain you know who you are and what your actions did to me, but I've not heard from you in years, so maybe you're blissfully unaware. I'm not exactly mad at this one person, but I'm certainly mad at the world for keeping me here and not letting me die in peace like I wanted to for years. I'm somehow not suicidal as of 2018, to which I credit psychedelics for helping me build a wall between myself and the suicidal mindset.          
  
Back to the story.       
             
I was injured in 2011, a few months before my 16th birthday. It was a joke, to be fair. To explain what happened that day I have to explain a game that used to be played.   Someone who was my “friend” used to play this game called “Gaddafi”. The objective of the game was to shove your hand/foot up the person's ass without them being prepared. I know, high school shit. This was a logical extension of the game we used to play called “con queso” where you'd walk up behind someone and grab their ass. It was pretty gay to be honest, and I'm pretty sure most of the people playing these games are fairly bi or outright gay now.       
       
As things do when you're young and stupid, these things escalated pretty quick. I was standing in the middle of a hallway minding my own business, when out of nowhere - it happened. The single most devastating moment of my entire life happened. This “friend” ran up behind me full tilt, screamed “Gaddafi” and kneed me up into the air so hard that I flew up a number of feet, fell back down, and landed on the exact same spot where I had been kicked/kneed. The knee hit me between my tailbone and my pelvic floor, an area I later learned existed when a doctor diagnosed me with chronic pelvic floor dysfunction/chronic pelvic pain syndrome. I instantly saw black and rolled around on the floor for over a minute. It took over 2 minutes before I could see anything but black, and the pain was intense.        
       
It took about 2 years for the full damage to take hold. I was carrying a pillow to class for a few months after the injury, but eventually the pain got a little better. And then it got worse. I was an avid mountain biker at the time when this injury occurred, and in the years following. At almost exactly the two year mark after the injury the pain came out of nowhere and absolutely floored me. I couldn't walk, couldn't stand, couldn't leave bed. I spent my entire senior year of high school being homeschooled and beginning the chapter of my life where I didn't leave bed for over a year in a half, no exaggeration. Peeing in water bottles, attempting to stand every few days and winding up on the floor and needing my mom to pick me back up.               
    
And the fucking pain. I woke up screaming almost every single morning. It's hard to describe this kind of pain to someone who hasn't dealt with chronic pain. The best way I could describe it is that it was like waking up at the bottom of the ocean. I would start hyperventilating and screaming immediately, completely unable to deal with the sensation of pain radiating up and down my spine. The pain spread out over the course of those two years. It started just in my tailbone, then down my legs, then up my back. Eventually it seemed to “settle” in my face, burning and buzzing like I had my hand on an electrical socket. It would buzz behind my teeth to the point where my entire field of vision would blur and spin, making walking completely impossible from that point forward. Because the pain set in years after the injury, it took me a very long time to put the pieces together.      
     
Around the 2 and a half year mark of unbearable chronic pain (a few weeks before my 17th birthday), I discovered weed. By discovered weed, I mean I discovered my mom smoked weed. We all had suspected it, but one day I found myself in her bed (obviously having been carried there) and smelled it through her closet door. She had left the door of the safe open. She went away later that day and I stumbled over, crawling on the floor as I had learned to do, and lifted myself up to the safe sat on the floor. I didn't even hesitate for a second when I pulled the handle of the cheap lock box as hard as I could and felt it break in my hands. I pulled out a bag which I would later learn was an ounce worth of bud, closed the door, and crawled back to bed. I found one of her one hitters and a lighter in the bag and laid down on her bed as I packed my first hit of pot.       
       
Again, it's hard to describe these sensations to someone who has never been in this kind of situation. It didn't make my pain go away, but it certainly did more than anything else I had ever been given. To be fair, I hadn't been given any pain medicine at this point other than 25mg of tramadol which didn't do jack shit. I held the smoke in and stood up. The pain still felt like someone had hooked jumper cables to my tailbone, but I was standing. I wasn't buckling at the knees and falling on my face as I had the years past. I finally had some semblance of control.        
        
What follows is 5 years of heavy, if not excessive cannabis use. I made no effort to hide it from my family, and our house quickly became engulfed in a strong scent of vaporized marijuana. I picked up cooking it pretty quick, and soon I was filling gel capsules with infused coconut oil and carrying them with me everywhere I went.        
        
It's an understatement to say I was never without weed. I was never without upwards of a half oz worth of weed. I spent years doing this until it started to not work.        
         
At age 16 I was prescribed muscle relaxants and gabapentin. At age 17 I was given my first script for opioids. In retrospect, I think swallowing the first pill was the most terrible decision I've ever made, as well as the best decision I've ever made.     
       
I'm going to leave the story here for now, as it's so long and convoluted that I don't think it would fit in a single Reddit post and make any sense in a single sitting.

But I heard from my friend today that another friend of mine had snorted 0.5g heroin yesterday and now he doesn't answer his phone or anything? Isn't this a very high dose? I believe my friend has a moderate opiate tolerance but definitely NOT a high one. 

He only started expirmenting with opiates a few months ago and mostly Oxycontin and codeine and started using heroin only occasionally in the beginning of the summer I think and I have no idea what dosages he's used too. So is 0.5 enough to kill you? Also I think he might have drank beers too... ",1534168582.0

I have taken Tramadol approximately i dont know, 25 times in the past 6 months due to extreme pain
My dose is very low
I try splitting the 50mg capsules in half sometimes


ANYWAYS!

What ive noticed with Tramadol is that sometimes it works extremely extremely well like i had just unlocked the key to enlightenment,

And sometimes it does not.

I am not opiate naive,

I take it before, or after my Suboxone

Taking it after produces a more sedating effect


ON THE GOOD DAYS THAT TRAMADOL WORKED,
It was like clear-headed pain killing focus

But that was only a couple of times

I am now foregoing the Tramadol.

Buprenorphine relieves my pain but it is not controlling it to the degree that i need . I have not tried re-doseing bupe as i do not know if it would have any effect taking more hours later . 

Buprenorphine though hasn't produced any side effects
it acts as a typical opiate , just no pain killing effects, which fucking sucks

I am taking a boatload of NSAIDs alternating between diclofenac/naproxen and motrin in conjunction with tylenol and a few other things and its wearing thin on me.

I have some type of facial pain disorder which also has created a TMJ (jaw/ears/etc) disorder. some type of neuralgia . i have to get more MRIs.

So the doc gave me 15 tramadol, i had a few at home anyways,and yea, shit, i lost track

Anyways Tramadol has some horrendous side effects including memory loss, tremors, loss of coordination and focus, inability to focus, fuck me in the ass


It did help with upper-scalp migraines . 

so what do i ask for next?

the doctor knows i take suboxone, and has spoken with my suboxone doctor, which is how i got the trams

I don't want to come off as a drug seeker even though im seeking drugs to cure my goddamn pain lol

I would appreciate any input on how to discuss with my doctor to switch to ANYTHING (literally anything) even if its abuse proof: i.e. abuse proof oxy, abuse proof hydrocodone, etc.",1534163547.0

I actually first tried it because of this girl I had a huge crush on was a pot head. Interesting enough 18 years later that same  Girl is laying in bed Next to me sleeping as I write this. 

It’s Been a rough road to get where we are, and I only see things getting harder for us both. Now if your thinking this is some great love story about how drugs brought us together you would be wrong. Drugs have done nothing but tear the two of us apart time and time again. Some how though we always end up back with each other. This on/off again relationship took a major turn 10 years ago when she Told me that she had begun using Heroin. At the time I was still a pot head and completely opposed to the idea of using anything harder. 

At the time she had come to me, wanting to stop, at least that is what she said and we gave it a go, but with time i realized that i didn’t trust her, and therefore I didn’t love her.  We split up this time for about 3 years, until i found out she had been arrested for forging checks. I thought at the time maybe this would be her chance to stop so i decided to start corresponding with her until she got out of jail and after we started living forward again. Yet still there was trust issues, and eventually we again broke it. 

Over the years we have not spoken I rarely seen her around the small town we live in, when i did it was the only way i knew she was alive, at one point i was even checking the obituaries every morning with my breath held convinced that today would be the day I would find her name . 

about Three years ago I found out that after i last split up she had become homeless, and was eventually taken in off the streets by some one who was also abusing Heroin and other drugs, we ran in to each other and some angry words where exchanged and it ended with me having a mental breakdown. See she has a funny way of making everyone around her think they are crazy especially me. She actually had me doubting myself that I was just paranoid and that she was clean all this time.  eventually i would find out the truth though. 

This last April I finally did see her Name on the front page of the newspaper only not in the obituaries, but the front page story with the headline Three arrested for Prostitution. Wow my heart broke instantly i’ve known this woman she was 16. About a month later When she got out she emailed me, two weeks went by before i actually seen the email,  it said she was sober and determined to stay that way. So with out a second thought i responded. 

Came to find out what had happened, and that she was once again homeless, In all honesty I believed her when she told me she wasn’t using, but i still didn’t trust her. One other issue we have had over the years is my temper and nothing brings that out more then some one lying to me. several things happened over the next month to make me question her honesty about being clean. Then she had a bad day and came to me telling me that she wanted to shoot again, and I made the biggest mistake of my life. 

I told her if you do it, I do it and so we did. A week later she moved in with me and not a single night has passed that we haven’t shot Heroin.

I don’t want too, yet I feel like i have made a deal with the devil and there is no getting out of it now, I only hope at some point she is ready to stop, and that i still have the strength to do so my self.  I love her with all my heart and if need be I will dive in to hell to drag her out, I just hope we can both make it back.",1534140934.0

We pulled into the Chevron. She jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for the 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted $40. She told me to drive to a few other places and jumped out to check at different houses. I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup all over the interior of my mother’s Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and before the sun came up my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.

I continued to vomit on myself and let my bowels go on the drive home. “I’m going to die. I’m going to die,” I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth. Warm liquid spread across the seat of my pants.

My father met me at the front door. He knew I had stolen the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn’t get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER, where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me any, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.

“I’m about to sh\*t!” I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.

A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Oregon. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time. He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die. I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom’s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drunk a half-bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, defecated on the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning.

Fell asleep for like 20 minutes then woke up and chugged the half a pitcher I had. Got hit by a car (our Uber driver) woke my boss up at 4 am because I was sleep walking, etc.

So, I'm still alive, wild as ever, hoping court goes well, and some fucking how still have a job. But idk if I'm getting invited next time we do a ""get drunk with everyone from work"" thing.

Bonus points for the Uber driver that hit me being my dental hygienist's mom and me repeatedly telling her how hot her daughter was before she hit me with a car... I have a dentist appointment in like a week so that should be fun.

Ya ya you shouldn't push in while tied but most do. Sometimes I hear a gurgling and feel the same when I don't get it off before I start pushing in.  I never use to. There's no reaction or pain. No blowing of veins. It happens on certain veins on both arms. I actually now know I hit when it happens. It's like its the shot bouncing off the tie or slowing down. It still goes through when tied.

I never could get through to users who thought their tie stopped all the shot so when they took it off they'd get it all at once....you'd have to tie off so tight you'd amputate to stop it from getting through.

I'm just wondering if anyone notices this. Smaller veins too. My big were fucked into komodo dragon scales long ago. Good thing tho? I can't hit it so the blood pumps through there like a champ.

To my surprise, it feels nothing like any other opiate. I feel very happy, talkative, and upbeat. However, I feel none of the opiate feelings, no body high, no buzz, nothing.

So I was on sub maintenance for almost a year and relapsed on methadone.  In the past I’d thrown myself into precipitated withdrawals messing with dones before so I came up with these moronic rules like wait 48 hours after short term methadone use to avoid pw, but this time told myself to give a couple extra days by using fentanyl (my addict brain at work).  I cheek the patches and last Tuesday after sleeping with a patch in my cheek I woke up at 5am for work and instantly threw 16mg sub under my tongue thinking I’d waited long enough.  AWEFUL.  As soon as I clocked on I knew something was up so made an excuse and dipped out.  Five hours later I still felt shitty and gave in and bought more dones.  Used about 30 mgs for four days and then one 75mg patch yesterday morning since my weekend is tomorrow and Tuesday.  Felt shitty this morning and in really mild withdrawal but didn’t want to take any opiates so I could dose Suboxone tomorrow.  So I took about 60 mgs of loperamide today at 3 pm and have been using kratom throughout the day and have some for tonight and if needed tomorrow.  My question is if I can use my Suboxone tomorrow if I’m feeling shitty?  This whole deal has scared the shit out of me and I want to get back on my Suboxone maintenance again and be happy.  Any help would help, thanks in advance!

After two weeks of the symptoms getting worse I stopped taking the subs for two days and then talked to my doctor. Got an ekg that showed no issues and switched to subutex. Only tried those for two days and immediately felt ten times worse. Haven't taken any more bupe and the symptoms have slowly gotten better with each passing day. 

What's the deal? Everyone I know tolerates bupe with basically no major issues. I have tried just about every opiate/opiod available in the states and have never had any adverse effects. Sure some things I didn't enjoy like tramadol but never anything really bad.

Typically a lurker/reader of this sub, and I drew inspiration from the cold cop stories. I've tried CL, Whisper and Tinder with 0 success which surprised me because I live in a fairly large urban city and less than 2 hours away from a well-known city with bountiful open markets. I searched the typical keywords on CL with no success, posted about 2 Whispers with no response and made a Tinder profile but a few swipes in and I knew it wouldn't be fruitful. I remember seeing a post about POF, so I decided to try it. BINGO.

This is my second attempt at cold copping, and it finally paid off. How I did it: I found a picture of myself that didn't show any identifiers like tattoos and didn't really show all of my face. I showed enough of myself where someone would be on the fence if I was catfish or not, but interested enough to message me. In order to weed out any people actually looking for love (lol), my tagline or the text that appeared next to my picture said ""looking for a plug only."" Plug is a more popular term in the black community where I live than connect (I'm a black female btw).

Next, weeding out messages. I wait for them to message me. I only respond to messages that start with ""what are you looking for,"" ""what kind of plug,"" ""what do you need"" or anything along those lines. I don't respond if they simply say ""hey beautiful"" or give me a random compliment because I don't want to give the impression that I'm actually interested in dating. I'm on a mission! Lol.

Maybe every 3 out of 10 messages ask me what I'm looking for. When I say that I'm looking for percs (I really mean just good ole oxy by its lonesome, but again - slang), maybe 1 of those 3 people follows up with ""how many"" ""what kind"" etc. I've made plans to meet up with a total of 3 or 4 people total (including both cold cop attempts) and all of them fell through because the person stopped responding after setting up a (public) place to meet and exchanging numbers. Disappointing but part of the game.

FINALLY, I found a person that followed through! He only had 15s, and he was selling them at $1 per mg. I've gotten offers for $8 per 15mg and $20 per 30mg before, but as I said, none of those offers came through. But I'm desperate at the moment since I haven't been high in a week or two, and I know that $1 per mg isn't abnormal. So I ask if he could do 7 for $100, but he only had 4 left. (It takes about ~40mg to get me high). The available quantity was disappointing but I didnt care. So I told him I'll buy all 4, for the normal $1 per mg price.

4 hours later he messages me and tells me he's mobile and meet him in 15. I met him by a random intersection of streets in the hood. He came to my window and waited. I flashed a smile and opened my palm to signify I wanted to see the pills before I gave him the money. They looked legit so I handed him the cash. He asked me if I smoked because he wanted to smoke me out, but I declined because my only drug vice is popping pills. I really don't fuck with weed because it gives me anxiety and alcohol gives me migraines. He tried asking me out but I told him I had to go, so he told me to keep in contact, then we parted ways and now I'm high. A love story. the end.

If you're curious about any other aspect of my cold cop, just ask. This is my first reddit post so sorry if I included too many unnecessary details lol.",1534116320.0

Daily I work towards small victories in this sober lifestyle. Living in a 3/4 house, I get randomly drug tested as part of their policy of residency. I don’t even smoke weed, which legally I can obtain a medical card, but under a federal VA rule I cannot smoke.


Small victories everyday. I bust my ass sweating buckets doing dirty manual labor all day, and without drugs I find I need to set up small things to look forward to. Instant gratification is something as addicts we altered in our brains. Dopamine in our brains is lacking without drugs, and drugs ruled over food, sleep, safety, and relationships. Heroin puts us in an animal state where dope is number one. 

I find what I have to do to live a semi fulfilling life is to set up small victories for gratification purposes. All day I’m working, I try to glorify taking a nice shower to clean up, and thinking about what movie or show I want to watch to try to have something to look forward to. Even if it means not smoking all day to get back and enjoy a cigarette after a hard days work, that small victory helps me with the monotony of life.

I’m sure normal people get more fulfillment from things, and are able to think outside that box and socialize and achieve things higher up in the hierarchy of needs as per Maslows triangle. But as addicts, we have to live a different lifestyle, and many of us turn to drugs because we see the ceiling of society and just say fuck that. Working every single day to pay out all your income to bills and rent is not a life we want. We opened Pandora’s box and felt the euphoria of heroin and now know there is another, easier way to live. But in the end, that life leads to misery. 

I’m ranting, just wanted to say, life is boring and living sober we see what’s really to be of our lives. It’s hard to live sober after use, but small victories and achievable goals help get through the day. I just hope I can stay the course. I’m still in that addict mindset of living day to day, and I don’t like it.

When that ended, it started a six year run almost with heroin. During my senior year of university I got arrested for sales and distribution and got 18 months while being kicked out of school. California good time made that nine months and it was the only time in those past six years that I was clean. 

I got out about two years ago and for all intents and purposes, I got my life back together if you ask anyone that knows. I went back to school and now I'm on the other side of the country in Ohio but I never stopped using. I just used less. When I finally transferred back from community college to where I am now, that was always my ""expiration date"". Once I get there, I'll stop. Once I'm back to where I was before everything went to shit. The change in scenery would help I always reasoned and since leaving a few weeks ago, I've been clean for the first time in seven years. But it's miserable.

Logically, I recognize that at one point I must have been normal but now it's all so dreadfully boring. I am going through the motions because it's expected of me but I am miserable and unhappy. I haven't been physically sick in a couple weeks. I'm sleeping again. But I'm in a new city and all I do is wake up and watch tv and have trouble getting out of bed. Everyone keeps congratulating me and I try to be happy and tell them thank you but I want to puke from the banality and nonsense of it all. 

I'm not sure I even want to be sober but I know I'm suppose to be. I did a year of out patient meetings before leaving to come here (despite the fact that I used through it all) and it wasn't for me. I met good people but couldn't stand the fakeness of it all. Hell, I got high with half the people I met there. I kept trying to say I was going to quit the week before I moved but I used until the night before I left for my now second trip university, definitely older this time but obviously not wiser. My first seven days here were miserable. The first night I finally slept, I was genuinely ecstatic. I honestly woke up positively thinking, more than just thinking I could do it, but that I wanted to do it. I went for an appointment at the school and got outside for the first time and then a day or two later the feelings I am describing now started to kick in.

School starts August 21st. The idea of sitting through engineering and mathematics or of leaving and doing anything just seems like something I'm not interested in. But I'm not interested in anything. I was watching a powerful documentary called Amy on Netflix that followed the life of Amy Winehouse from childhood to death through home videos and after she got clean and won the grammys and everyone around her was congratulating her, she told her best friend that this was all so fucking boring without drugs. She died a little bit later. That's the best way to describe how I feel. Not the dying. I'm not suicidal. But life is fucking boring and yet I know this is normal. At one point I was happy with normal. 

I know enough to know that my brain is fucked, chemically, and in all likelihood just isn't producing enough chemicals to balance me out because it was use to being flooded all the time by the heroin. But knowing something logically doesn't help deal with it and I don't know where to go from here. Whether I should say fuck expectations and try to find something here or if I can deal with this. When I was physically ill, it's strange but I was determined. ""Fuck you sickness. I'm stronger than you."" Now not so much,  especially because there seems to be no logical conclusion. I've read everything from this lasting thirty days for some to literally never ending for others. 

At a time I should be happy and everyone around me is happy, I am miserable.",1534097562.0

i recently noticed that when i took a small dose of kratom (1-3g of green malay, usually i have like 6g of red but ran out), ill get that nice warm glow for 1-6 hrs depending on the dose, but then when it wears off i get goosebumps straight away! (with low doses of the green strain anyways, with red ones and in a decent dose-- im good for like 12 hrs)

i took some loperamide after (2mg), and then 4mg more cos i had trouble sleeping when my kratom ran out-- goosebumps vanish, but then after a single 1g dose of kratom (scraped the bag lmao), they returned 1h after the dose wore off!

ended up taking 16mg of loperamide yesterday, since it kept getting knocked off my receptors with the miniscule doses of kratom i was taking at seperate intervals-- when usually just 2mg does the trick for the whole day

I sometimes enjoy prepping a nice moderate speedball and walking my dog to the local park to find a nice quiet spot to shoot before the walk home. Well, tonight as I was prepping the hit I happened to notice my little ziploc baggy (the 1"" x 1"" size) was closed but sitting in a small puddle of condensation from where my water bottle sat just earlier. I immediately snatched it up and looked through the non-graphic/clear side to see that, while 99% of it was dry, there was a bit of water that had found tiny holes in the crevasses of the bags edges and some had begun to dissolve into mush. I dumped the  bag onto a small plastic card, and eventually got the dry coke into a new bag while a bit of this mush was left behind stuck to the card. ""Waste not, want not"" I told myself as I scraped this remainder into my mixer, added a bit of tar, and (this was where I fucked up) decided to add just a liiiitle more coke, two very small pebbles...

What you have to understand at this point is that, when crystalline solids dissolve into a solvent, their physical volume begins to mean nothing.. I can dissolve a gram of blow and a milligram of blow in the same amount of water and give you two syringes. One will likely kill you, the other likely wont have any effect. So while I assumed that this small pittance of wet coke deserved some additional company (more coke), it could have in fact already been perhaps 4 or 5 times my normal dose. I didnt watch it begin to dissolve and didnt note the weight of my coke before and after it was removed to see how much was actually there.

So I walk to the park, crouch down to 'tie my shoe,' tie off, hit on my first poke (which is quite an achievement when you've been slamming tar multiple times a day for a year),  and slowly push the whole lot in. I normally push half and wait a few moments to see how I feel before doing the rest, but I was pushing slow enough to avoid slipping out of the vein that when I got to the halfway point and didnt feel that overwhelmed  I just decided to inject the rest (this was my second mistake).

I knew I was in for it when I immediately felt a new, strong pressure in my lower abdomen. Then I heard the squealing laughter of  children playing even though I looked around and saw no children.. I felt pressure build up in my right eadrum like when you're descending in an airplane. Everything was fuzzy. The words and images on my phone waved, pulsated, and the white background on the Google homepage looked like static on an old TV with no channel dialed in.. the ringing was insane. Every time i shifted my gaze I would see a new hallucination in my peripheral vision. A few times I would actually see my hallucination front and center and it would relate to my surroundings, but then would disappear after a few moments; like a little girl chasing after my dog, or a gardner picking weeds by the fence. I actually began to worry though once i started getting black spots in my vision like when you stand up too fast or are about to pass out. I sat down in the grass and began to evaluate my symptoms and assess for signs of stroke or heart attack. I forgot to bring my little blood pressure cuff, that would have been good to see,  I would have probably measured over 170/100 really. Ive never had such a strong rush ever and Ive measured higher.. I had no trouble reading, talking, moving. No weakness or tingling, nothing. So I got up and we started walking home.

The effects lingered for a couple hours. I'd see people disappearing around corners in the edges of my vision and occasionally hear muffled voices outside even though nobody was around. The small print on my phone would sometimes wiggle or disappear for a second, and random objects sitting on the table would move to different places and back. I honestly believe had I added a little bit more coke that I would have stroked out. Thanks for reading! And learn from my mistakes! Be safe!

There were over 100 pills in the bottle and I went through them all within 12 days. 

My opiate of choice is oxycodone and I usually do 30mg to get me feeling right. Since vicodin is weaker, I'd have to take ~45mg to feel the same as I would with oxy. Since the vics were only 5mg each, I had to pop 9 of those suckers. 

I was too lazy to do a CWE most of the time so I'd just swallow the 9 pills whole. This worked, and it gave me a decent buzz, but it was always accompanied with a nasty headache. I could never understand why that happened until one day I figured out it must be the fucking 3000mg of APAP I took. 

After that I started doing CWE more often, but whenever I did the high felt weaker. It turns out I wasn't leaving the solution in the fridge long enough for the APAP to settle out. After I perfected my method, I started getting waaaaaay better results; a good mellow high with no headache. It's such a damn shame I didn't figure this out earlier. I must have wasted at least 80 of the pills before I got the CWE method right.

All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight.,"Now, it may seem hard to believe that I would have been able to hide my whole body under the pillows on the bed, but remember, everything in the apartment was over sized, like it all belonged to a giant. There were even bigger throw pillows besides. When the owner of the place returned to his room, I could see the giant from under them. He wore a tan colored trench coat which he stripped off as soon as he entered the bedroom and sat with his back to me. He watched TV. There seemed to be no neck. Fuzzy strands of hair stuck out from the cratered back of his skull. The man wore a gown of his own flesh, which hung in ugly folds of white skin, and an even worse smell seemed to emanate from whatever strange bacterial cultures I imagined to be growing under those flaps of fat. The white comforter seemed visibly soiled anywhere his naked skin touched it. *This is what I get.* I thought. *This is what I get for doing meth with Chandra and letting Rufus talk me into running into some strange, stinky room.* It also occurred to me that most people wouldn't ever find themselves in a situation like this just because they went to an office party.  No.  This kind of ridiculousness was unique to life with Rufus.

He pulled a box from under the bed and produced two plastic dolls. The TV played in front of him. His silhouette played with the figurines. It was as unsettling and strange an event as I have ever witnessed in my life. The giant man began to speak for the figurines. One had a cockney accent and the other spoke with the voice of a girl in high school. There was conversation about the things they were wearing and plans for later. It was just the kind of thing you’d expect to see a child doing privately in their playroom, but it was this middle aged colossal cretin.

I would have laughed, but he passed gas, which was so revolting that I immediately began to gag. My body went limp. It was like this time I got food poisoning from this box of chow Mein an old lady gave me only this was worse. And whatever ability the gargantuan man had to articulate imaginary conversations between his Ken and Barbie dolls seemed to be lost as he pulled back the pillows to find me spewing vomit the consistency of creamy oatmeal onto the floor. He let out an angry bellow. He shouted wet and gargled words I couldn’t understand. He grabbed my hair. My body came up off the mattress like he was picking up a piece of clothing.

I tried to fight. I was too weak though and too sick. The smell of his fart had started me gagging and the smells in the rest of the apartment were now causing an involuntary retching which they hadn’t before. We ended up in the kitchen. He smashed the cabinet doors with my head. At some point he threw me on the ground, opened the refrigerator door and toppled it over onto me. Jars of jelly and old cardboard containers of rotten take out fell on me. Then, he picked me up by the neck. Just one of his hands held me up against the wall slowly choking me to death, but he let out an angry shout like some mythological creature who lived under a bridge. His breath led to more puke. It poured out of my nose. I swallowed some of it and struggled to breathe.

It’s funny the things you think about when your life’s being taken from you. There I was dying slowly as this man choked me to death. The place smelled terrible. I was pretty sure that I’d crapped my pants a little bit. It was an embarrassing scenario and an even more embarrassing way to die, but my mind kept telling me that there was honey spilled down my back and in my hair. I don’t think I ever told you that about me, but sticky things, like jelly or syrup or honey on my skin, drive me absolutely crazy. It was like whatever part of my brain that hated it so much was completely uninterested in my imminent death and only cared about getting that stickiness off my skin. Brains are weird like that.

Before all oxygen flow to my brain was cut and my eyes closed, Rufus smiled from over my opponent’s shoulder. He held a frying pan. He opened his eyes wide and the dull thud of cast iron against the back of my assailant’s skull let out in the kitchen. The giant crumpled to the ground. It took us a few minutes to get out of there, because somehow, I’d gotten stuck under him when we fell. We left the loot we’d originally intended to steal and stopped to collect ourselves once we got back to the freedom and fresh air on the streets.

I pulled my pack of cigarettes out. All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight. Rufus took them from me. He lit them and passed on back to me. We sat on the curb smoking.

“SHHHEEEEWOOOOO!!!!” He said giggling.

“I know.”

“Man, oh, man!”

“That was nuts!”

“I know.”

“We’ll be telling that story for years.”

It was getting to be midnight, so we walked back up to our spot. We passed a fat man in a brand-new rain poncho and combat boots. The man banged a staff like Gandolf and demanded drugs from passersby. Everyone knew he was a cop, and no one messed with him. The streets are like that. There’s some unspoken release of information dispersed among us about undercovers and the like, the same way bees all know how to act in unison. They don’t talk. They just know, and so did we.

Back at the spot Rufus and I did our shots. We nodded. Before the sun came up, the cops were kicking me in the leg and telling us we had to go.",1534047909.0

I’ll lay it out for you, but also for my own benefit in a therapeutic sense. I’m not gonna give you my life story, I’m not gonna give you a sob story about how I wasn't raised well, I’m not gonna tell you about belt buckles ripping up my back and damn well near getting infected. I’m gonna start you off the night of, and fucking well leave it there. It’s a story that happened in 3 minutes, and will take me a 12-chapter book to fully chronicle. I can’t prove any of this to you, but I can assure you it DID happen, and I DID go to a place in the perfect, sweet median between life and elsewhere.

Then without any more bullshit, here’s my tall tale.

We sat in a parking lot. Doesn’t matter where exactly. But it was in the “less nice” side of DC. The side where you can see the Washington Monument, yet recognize that you are existing in the shadow of it. Where tenant buildings crumble and young adults puff blunts on the staircases, brutally ignorant of their potential, yet fully self-aware of their worth weighed by the neglect of their community. Where tens of millions are quickly poured without second thought into the beauty and prestige of a capital that they hardly take a part of.

The reason I was down here was to score. Score some heroin to be exact. That’s something that your narrator hasn’t been too upfront yet. I have quite a turbulent relationship with thoat powder, rock, cap, tar, and the sticky gunk with specks in it that you can’t be too sure about. It’s love-hate, you know? But it’s something I’ve been loyal to and won’t go on leaving without a proper fight and messy custody hearing.

I won’t go into names here, so let me make that clear. The driver pulled into a spot where the overarching streetlight would be ideally placed to illuminate the neglected car’s interior. This was meant to allow use without sticking out in this place (it was relatively busy for a Tuesday night). I mixed up a small little pile of white, sloshed it around with the contents of an old hot water bottle, and drew it up through my rig (or a needle, for you normies).

When I pierced the easy-access vein on the top of my left arm, I dumped half of the murky red water in, and waited like I usually do out of some half-assed sense of safety. I usually wait for the rush to plateau before I clear out the whole barrel. This way, I wouldn’t literally kill my brain with pleasure. It’s a habit I’ve maintained progressively less and less out of convenience and no real close calls. I slumped down into the seat, my joints falling away from each other into an infinite, sublime, warm comfort. A few seconds too early, I finished off my hit. 

The rush from the first half was still rising - the second hadn’t had time to start yet. I knew I was in trouble, and tried to make a sound. A dry groan pushed its way out of my lip but by then I was already well and properly fucked. I kept climbing higher, higher, higher… a pause where all I saw was the back of the passenger seat, and then *black*.

Here’s where the “real” story begins.

I never really blacked out, though.

You know when you’re laying in bed? On the brim of sleep with your eyes shut, picturing yourself falling down? The moment before you hit, your body wildly jerks, although you’re fully aware it was all imagined. That’s how I came to. My high totally left me, I felt myself on the cusp of sobering up completely and the withdrawals were setting in - maybe it was panic. Naw, not this. This was inexplicable.

“Welcome to the New Way of Life meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, my name is -”

But it wasn’t my sudden sobriety that concerned me. It was the sudden change of scenery, and the change of scenery to the possibly worst place on this earth: an AA meeting.

Surveying my surroundings, I found a half-full room with heavy cigarette tar plastering already yellow and peeling wallpaper. Lights were dim, with one of the brightest bulbs flickering in 15-second sporadic bursts. It was epilepsy-inducing. Pretty aged and haggard characters in the front took long turns saying stuff, but I couldn’t hear all that well. A light, drilling hum quickly began, and subsequently worsened inside my head. No sound could penetrate this barrier. Occupant sharing this room with me were sparse. It wasn’t too easy to study them from lighting that seemed to cut plenty corners, but it was mostly men - maybe 5:1 ratio men to women. 

Shit... my back muscles began to start spinning into a fishing reel which pulled my whole body along like puppet string. Skin over my face contracted, probably giving me a hollowed appearance over my cheekbones. Maybe not - probably not. Felt awfully like that, though.

So, where the fuck was I? That’s what I wondered while my heart rate jacked. One moment I’m in a car, and the next thing I know I’m here. I can’t hear. I can hardly see. The ringing subsided - well, a bit. I could hear the man talking up front.

“Let’s welcome our speaker all the way from Anzio, Italy.”

Maybe two people clapped, the rest murmured. 

The collection basket was passed around.

“Boot - alcoholic.” That’s how the speaker introduced himself.

“Boot.” The crowd repeated in a monotone drone.

I could hardly hear the speaker, and struggled to pick up any bits or pieces. The ringing in my ears dissipated like a fog, but only slightly.

Tuning in, I realized that I missed the first, maybe, 15 minutes. As far as a life story goes, he was somewhere in his early adulthood.

“So, like I said, my father kind of groomed me for the family business.”

The basket inched closer, haphazardly thrown to whoever was on the right like a game of frugal hot potato.

“I did the best that I could.”

An aged wooden bin, woven together with gnarled oak sticks landed on my lap - hard. Startled, I looked down. Facing back up at me was the pale head of a fair-faced women. Hair white and elaborately knotted. Nose slender and rounded at the bottom. Her mouth mocked some semblance of words, but it was futile. Some victim of decapitation. Dried blood crusted in mounds under her, as the mouth continued working. No words and no air escaped. Powder covered her face sloppily, which left a long-dried trail of tears down her cheeks. She looked to be some kind French royalty, recalling a high school history class where I hardly paid any attention at all.

My eyes teared up, I swallowed hard down on rising vomit. That vinegar taste of stomach acid coated my throat. 

Trying to disregard the very-much conscious head inside, I tossed I placed it carefully two chairs to my right. 

“My reign, slowly devolved, I guess you could say.”

I harshly snorted the creeping mucus trying to escape back up into my burning sinuses.

“I fell into a slow decadence. The leisure of public office took front seat of the chariot.”

I looked around, careful as fuck, mind you. Panic made my breaths deeper, yet more shallow. Anxiety gripped at that magic nerve that connects the brain to spazzing muscles. The room was larger than I first thought, maybe ballroom-sized with rows of chairs facing towards the dark reddish wooden podium. Closest person was behind me to my right, two rows back. It was probably obvious, I admit, but I had to study his face. He was clothed in a puffy leather jacket, ruined by time and neglect. With arms crossed and his head down, I assumed he was asleep. As hard as I looked, I tried making out his face but all I could see was his stringy, sparse head of hair.

“Responsibility went by the wayside. My palace soon devolved into wine-fueled orgies. The construction project from my bridge drained the royal coffers. Bodies started to rack up. Couldn’t be too careful.”

Jesus Christ, where was I? This is Hell. I knew this had to be Hell.

“While I walked through one of my passageways, shadows casted by the crackling torches, one of my guards approached me. One of my Praetorian guards emerged from a side tunnel, knife in hand - I think it was Cassius. Anyway, a mob of them dressed in the height of fashion, plunged their knives in and out of my abdomen with animalistic grunts. I laid on that cold, black floor for what felt like hours before the torchlight extinguished. Now hear I am.”

Without noise or warning, a bony hand suddenly gripped down on my right shoulder like a vice. Call it imagination, but the fingers creaked like an antique door hinge. To be frank, it hurt like shit. Snapping my head to face the attacker, it was the man in the leather jacket. His facial features were soldered together, leaving his right eyelid to hang from his nose, lips nonexistent which bore bluish grey fractured teeth. Ridges and hard-set lines were the apparent signature left by a raging fire.

Words slithered out from his dead throat, which rang raspier than nails against chalkboard.

“A newcomer, eh? You think that’s bad!? I burnt alive in a car crash. My grandson with me, at that! Took about ten minutes ‘till I died!”

I remember vaguely springing up with his hand still in place, a wet crackling noise eliciting from his shoulder socket. With that, the hand eased off and I bolted toward the back exit. The speaker stopped, and I could see out of the corner of my eyes all of the ghouls watching me.

Putting all of my weight into it, I leaned sideways and slammed into the bar of the metal atrium door. Thankfully, it gave way, and I kept sprinting. Took a few seconds to realize I was running back TOWARDS the podium. Like some mirror of space and matter, I was propelled in the opposite direction. Spinning around, this happened maybe 15 more times until I eventually stopped dead in my tracks.

Nobody spoke or moved. They all stared at the sudden intruder who just became totally self-aware of his situation. The speaker has a furious scowl warping his face. Towering over me, he walked slowly in my direction. I couldn’t move, no matter how hard I tried to lift either one of my legs. He lumbered closer and closer. Transfixed on his stroll, he was suddenly upon me, grabbing my tan shirt and pushing me to the ground. I realized very quickly that I couldn’t breathe. the fall knocked the air clean out of me. Gasping for air, the speaker’s face was mere inches away from mine. I was sure that this would be it. 

“That was awfully rude,” he said. 

I tried shaking my head “no” wildly - scared literally to death.

“If you’re gonna -”

The man didn’t get to finish his sentence, but his faced cleared into a look of near-shock and a voice that sounded awfully like a woman escaped his lips.

“Administering another dose.” 

I sucked in a massive breath of air, filling my pained lungs. In that moment, my surroundings were made entirely clear to me. Sharp white light blinded me, and I leaned off the side of the gurney to vomit - much to the relief of my captors.

That very same voice that I heard moments before asked me, 

“Do you know where you are?”

“Yes... I’m in the back of an ambulance, aren’t I?”",1534040539.0

I’ve never had issues traveling with pills before, but I decided to look into it anyway. I’ve seen some posts on here asking about traveling with pills, so here’s what TSA has to say about traveling domestically within the US with medication. The main highlight is that TSA does NOT require you to keep your medication in the original prescription container. 

 - You can bring your medication in pill or solid form in unlimited amounts as long as it is screened.
Medication in liquid form is allowed in carry-on bags in excess of 3.4 ounces in reasonable quantities for the flight. It is not necessary to place medically required liquids in a zip-top bag. However, you must tell the officer that you have medically necessary liquids at the start of the screening checkpoint process. Medically required liquids will be subjected to additional screening that could include being asked to open the container.

- You can travel with your medication in both carry-on and checked baggage. It’s highly recommended you place these items in your carry-on in the event that you need immediate access.

- TSA does not require passengers to have medications in prescription bottles, but states have individual laws regarding the labeling of prescription medication with which passengers need to comply.

- Medication is usually screened by X-ray; however, if a passenger does not want a medication X-rayed, he or she may ask for an inspection instead. This request must be made before any items are sent through the X-ray tunnel.

I just did a traditional speedball (good cocaine and good heroin injected intravenously) and felt compelled to write about my love of them. At some point it started rhyming so I just went with it.

Don't do IV  cocaine either but for the love of jj please don't mix them and bang that shit. Do as I say not as I do.

I'm probably going to do another big one (biggest of the day) around 9 or 10 with another bar then go to bed around 11 or 12 whenever the coke fades. I have a decent tolerance to boy and girl but not xans. I really want to steal the declaration of independence or crown jewels but idk where the declaration of independence is and I don't think my country has crown jewels unless they stole some other countries crown jewels and they're hidden away somewhere top secret like that warehouse from Indiana Jones.

They must have dropped it at one of my neighbors doors who kindly returned it. I forgive the mailman now, no need for all that violent shit.

I've been clean off heroin for around 18 days now. Kratom has been my lifeline and getting me through the days without relapsing. I usually buy 250g from a vendor in my state for around 30 bucks and its priority shipping so it never gets here later than 1 or 2 days.

Well I timed my next order to arrive on the day I ran out of my last batch.  I lost my job going to detox for the dope so after bills I'm incredibly tight right now and have yet to even get an interview anywhere else. I checked my tracking info and 
 It said my kratom was delivered in the mailbox at 3:45pm yesterday. I went out to check the mail, but there was no fucki g package in there. I live in an apartment complex where each unit has to open there mailbox with a unique key, and the mailman has a master key to all the boxes from the back. Well this asshole left it wide open so anyone's mail is accessible. 

I took a quick visual look in the other tenants mail boxes and my shit isn't in any of them. There were other packages in there but they were definitely not mine and that leads me to believe mine was not stolen, the mailman is just retarded.

I am fiending for my shit and I don't want to go back to opiates. Headshops around here charge the same price I paid online for a fucking ounce of kratom.

Well i was at my converted shed room on sunday night (i got lent by my friend whos on holliday), doing my usual junkie stuff, cooking up coke, shooting snowballs with the lads, and between the 3 of us we had pretty much every opiate you could imagine on the table. it was a good night. Now, i thought this was a real nice night, why not bust out the olanzapine.

so i gave 2 to my friends, hit the pipe, and took 4 or maybe 5 pills. i didnt realize how dangorous it is to fuck about with these pills, but because i didnt notice any affect, so i thought they were duds, and just popped a handful down my guzzler. half hour later, i remember feeling paralized. awake, but anable to move any part of my body, except the middle and index finger of my left hand.

now i was trying to speak to my friends, but i was like dicaprio in the wolfe of wall street after popping the ludes. all i could do was dribble. then i blacked out.

When i woke up, it was daytime, my friends had gone. i got up groggily and stumbled around, then i realised i fucked up. I checked my phone, and it was 1:pm on tuesday. i took the fucking pills sunday night, i was shaking so bad, dopesick as hell . dunno how i passed out through withdrawals? like is that even possible? Well i had 20 calls from people that were worried about me, my dealers in particular new something was up that i hadnt called them all day, and thought i'd OD's. jeans slightly damp, think i pissed myself over the days but they dont smell so i dunno.

TL;DR - What the actual fuck? did i go to a coma? did i die? what the hell happend? i didnt have any dreams, fell asleep sunday, woke up tuesday. this has never happend befor, and i took some high doses of drugs",1534012843.0

It wasn’t because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal.","I sat up. “I’m not crying.” I said.

He told me he was sick. I forgot all about the Faceless One and Ally Alcoholic and everything Jimbo told me. Rufus had been through booking the day before and once he was booked they released him. A big city like that doesn’t have the resources to keep people jailed for minor things. The warrant was for an old shoplifting ticket and an unpaid fine. It wasn’t ever getting paid. The city knew that. We knew that. That’s just how it was. Next time they saw Rufus and recognized him, they’d run his name, and he’d go to jail again to be booked and released.

I showed him what I’d gotten from Jimbo and Fin the day before for Bug’s eye. He ran in place and let out a giddy laugh. It took him a few minutes to fix it all up, but once he did, he told me we were going to an office party that evening.

“An office party?”

“Yeah. Fat Channy wants us to go.” Those were his last words before he fell asleep. When the cops came I already had him over my shoulder and was walking across the street to the park where we usually spent the first parts of our days.

Chandra, or Fat Channy as we called her, had been off the streets for the last 9 months. There was no need for her to have that nickname, as there weren’t any other Chandras or Channys around to differentiate from. She was fat though and didn’t seem to mind. In the summertime she wore sleeveless dresses, so you could see where she’d been damaged in a fiery car wreck on the freeway years before. Paper bag flesh covered the unsightly striations and knots of scar tissue like chicken bone gristle holding her together inside. She wore braces made of metal rods and black Velcro. Most of her face had been left intact but for the crenulate trough of missing meat running from her neck and up into the cheek where veins and tendons had been borrowed. She looked lonely and hurt. Her eyes were kind and teeth pretty the few times she ever smiled.

We first started seeing her come around Pill Hill year or so before, always trying to trade or sell her Ativan and Vicodin for something better. On top of the accident, she’d been born with some disease the details of which were unclear but that’d given her rights to a lifetime supply of prescriptions for low grade pain killers and anxiety meds and antidepressants. She liked heroin and did meth sometimes. Unlike us though, she could keep an apartment and job. Her visits to the streets were always desperate but short lived. She never spent the night.

But somehow someone talked her into smoking crack. That was it for her. She’d kept her life together while using for some time, but less than a week after she hit the rock, she was living outside like the rest of us. Her health got worse. Rufus and I adopted her as a third in our party for a short while and pushed her new wheelchair for her. One day, her father came to get her. He put her in rehab. She’d gotten a job as a secretary and lived in a halfway house. We were her only friends and would now be her guests at the party for her office.

It was a regular day for us. Rufus nodded out. We sat on the sidewalk or on benches. When he was awake our heads swiveled on our necks back and forth like spectators at a tennis match. We watched the passing pedestrians. The city offered so much for us to see in a single sitting. There was a transsexual in red, horsehair extensions and Dorothy’s blue checkered vest from the Wizard of Oz and black leather combat boots. A street artist painted for a crowd. Another played drums on empty five-gallon buckets. Pigeons scavenged the sidewalks as dirty and desperate as we were. There were strange conversations. A 50-year-old man cried into his phone that his mother was too mean, that he wouldn’t give her this kind of power any more. The prettiest girl we saw that day wore face paint and talked to herself. Rufus drooled. He nodded. I bought a pack of Reds, which was half gone in a couple of hours. As the day cooled off and evening approached, Rufus woke up for good. He was ready to go to the party. We walked towards the address.

“Now, when we get there, Boom Boom. We have to look normal. Ya know? Channy’s supposed to be doing well and all that, and she is, but you know, people like her coworkers, straight laced types don’t expect people like us to be coming to their parties. It’s vital that we seem as normal as is possible, my dear Boom Boom.”

I shook my head. “I know, Roof. I know. What’s that?”

He was bringing what looked like a Xanax bar to his lips with his fingers. “Xanax.”

“WHAT? After everything you just said?” This was Rufus’s super power. We all had superhuman powers as street addicts. Not that they were particularly helpful or did anything but hurt us, but they were things most humans couldn’t accomplish. Like this, with Rufus, the ability to hold within himself such glaring contradictions in thought, word and deed simultaneously and to be at such peace about it was extraordinary. He would have been a great cartoon character.

Needless to say, the party was a disaster for the first hour we were there. Not because of me though. Obviously, our grease caked pores and the raggedy seams of the fabric on our clothes and bags made our homelessness and drug addiction hard to hide. Fat Channy had been giving me worried looks as soon as she saw us. Perhaps she never considered how awkward it would be to have us there. But there we were. Rufus would try to hide his nods by picking up random objects and holding them to his face, like he was reading or studying them. He nodded off mid conversation with Chandra’s boss. From time to time I heard him telling the partygoers about how his last girlfriend had ripped him off or asking what they thought about how hard it was to find a public restroom in the city anymore. He didn’t realize that these were problems homeless drug addicts have. Regular people didn’t have these issues. Later, he tried to cut a piece of cheesecake. It wasn’t because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal. Channy and I watched horrified. The piece Rufus cut was a lopsided square from the middle of the cake. He nodded out in the middle of transferring it to his plate and stood asleep in the way of everyone who came to get something from the drink and food bar.

Eventually, though, everyone was drunk. No one was lucid enough to notice or care that Rufus and I were obviously street people. Chandra didn’t feel embarrassed by it. Strings of lights kept the place dim and set the mood. Brains saturated in ethyl alcohol let loose from their lips low toned and lustful murmurings. Channy sat next to me on the couch. I put my arm around her, and she put her head on my shoulder. There was a stifled outburst of snorting laughter from another room. The cold metal rods of her leg brace pushed into my knee. Rufus had disappeared.

Channy whispered to me. “I got some meth.”

“What?” I shook my head. As cold and calloused as the streets were and as ruthless and ridiculous as I’d become, I had no desire to watch this girl throw her life away again. Maybe it was an attachment developed from all that time we pushed her wheelchair around. Or maybe it was a latent affection for the hope she gave me. She got off the streets. She was sober and had a job.

Fat Channy wasn’t well, though. She could die if she started using again, but she was persistent. It was all we knew of each other and the means of our closest bonding. We locked the door to the bathroom and put the lid on the toilet down. She pulled out the bag and an old Kohl’s credit card to crush it up and snort. She bowed before it and pulled some into her nostrils. Then, I did. After that, I told her about my heroin. She insisted even harder than before that I share, which I did. Channy puked in the toilet.

It was getting late, and as we walked back out into the party, I wondered where Rufus had disappeared to. The front door opened. He walked in and whispered to me.

“I gotta show you something.” He was staring at a drunk man in a nice button up shirt and loosened tie dancing by himself in the middle of the party. Everyone else had either left or slumbered in each other’s arms or made out.

We walked through the halls and up the stairs a few stories and came out on a level that had apartments. Apparently, he’d been prowling and ended up in one of them. Channy stayed back. That was the last we saw of her for a while. Rufus came to the door. He stooped and looked at me wide eyed with his pointer finger on his lips. He said it had been unlocked.

Inside the first thing I noticed was an unbearable stench. We crept around. Everything in the apartment seemed to be disproportionately large. The living room was covered in a foot or more of empty tallboys. There were smears of feces and blood on the floor which had been sprinkled over with sawdust rather than cleaned up. A bowl of fruit loops had been shattered against the wall. The cereal stuck solidified to the wall and floor. Grey colored bathwater sat an inch below a ring of grime on the tub. A giant pair of white briefs with thick brown streaks in the seat sat wrinkled on the floor by the toilet. Rufus pulled me into the bedroom and pointed to a piece of gold bullion on a mantle above the head of the bed. I jumped onto the bed. It was higher than most other beds I’d been on. It was also perfectly made and clean, unlike everything else in the apartment. The extra soft mattress, or maybe it was a waterbed, and comforter made it almost impossible to crawl across it. I was stuck.

I turned to Rufus and tried to tell him, but before I spoke, the front door opened. It bounced off the spring stop. Someone with a gruff voice cleared their throat, and elephantine footsteps could be felt in the floor. It was whoever owned the place. They were home.",1534003963.0

I'll buy a couple points, binge for 3-4 nights, then not touch the stuff for a year. I get urges sometimes but I've never had withdrawals. 

My most recent binge ended a couple nights ago, afrer I had a few days off work. This time though, I feel really rough. It started about 5pm yesterday, with me feeling light-headed, dizzy, a little nauseous, exhausted (even though I'd slept a good 9 hours the night before) and my pupils were dilated. However I got through work just fine.

 This morning I woke up and things have been getting worse. More nausea, sweating a bit, alternating between feeling too hot and too cold, and I feel weak at the legs. I still made it into work and got things done but I've took a few minutes for a sit down and a smoke.

Thing is I don't know if it's early WDs or I just fucked my immune system and got sick. Is three days of use (not non-stop) really enough to trigger WDs? ",1533996161.0

96g1i1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96g1i1/homeless/,25,https://redd.it/96g1i1,PillMomThrow,Homeless.,"I'm again writing this post from a homeless shelter. It's 7:15am, 15 minutes after drinking my mixed drink with 5g of Green Maeng Da. I don't like to make excuses for the things I need to do to survive, but I do have a physical ailment which is made better by taking kratom. At the end of the day, however, if I'm popping morphine every single day or chugging powdered leaf every 4 hours does any of that really matter? I didn't seem to when I was on it. I withdrew between doses like any good junkie, even when taken as directed I was just fucking gone the entire time I was on the pills.       
       
I was in the department of social services building a few days ago and didn't have the opportunity to weigh out my dose, and was being told if I didn't get a call back within 2 hours I would be sleeping on the street as it's not below a certain temperature outside. My mind was racing, I couldn't focus on anything thinking about how I would keep my bags safe around a group of about 30 homeless people who looked absolutely terrifying. It's kind of funny to me that I'm so scared of homeless people despite the fact that I had become one of them.        
       
I walked into the bathroom past the two cops and large sign which read ""DRUG USE IS NOT ALLOWED AND WILL BE GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THOSE CAUGHT BREAKING THIS RULE WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.      
       
Or something.         
        
My bags were heavier than I could handle, my back was screaming after the 7 hours between the last dose as I walked away from my bags and into the bathroom. I wasn't particularly worried about getting robbed, but it was a very real concern. I knocked on the door and heard no response, but through the crack of the stall door I saw a metal spoon sitting with a small gooey black dot in the middle on the toilet paper dispenser. I immediately darted my eyes away, backed up, and walked to the next stall. Jesus fucking Christ if I can see that how the fuck do you think the guard who is about to walk in is about to react?       
           
I had stayed in a general homeless shelter the night before. Every 10 minutes or so another person would walk out of the bathroom and stumble out to their table with a taped ball of cotton on their forearm. They had ripped my bags apart looking for any drugs, stealing my quarter oz of hemp flower. It didn't make any sense that so many people got drugs in without issue. I tried as hard as possible not to look at anyone in the eye, a good 3/4 of the people in that shelter were very obviously drugged heavily. I want to say that was the scariest night of my life, but my mom was actually a lot more serious of a pillhead. I had suspected she would overdose very soon now that she didn't have me to steal pills from. I put myself on kratom a few years back when I discovered 8 stolen scripts later that she didn't like it. She would keep telling me to go back to the pain center, somehow not realizing that I knew what she was doing.         
       
Back to the social service building. I quickly spooned 2 large scoops of powder into my mouth and chased them down with a small water bottle of fermented cranberry juice. I wanted to vomit immediately, but I didn't haven't even a little extra kratom so this wasn't even an option at all. I gagged and a few minutes later I felt the nausea start to pass. I hadn't eaten anything in almost 2 days. Well, aside from kratom of course.      
      
Within a half hour I started to feel not good. I'm sitting in this building surrounded by methadone maintenance patients, straight up junkies, and whatever else walked into the office begging for a handout. Some needed it, some were very upfront about their situation and didn't. I don't really know how to describe why I felt so much different than all these people, but in the last year I had spent less than $200 on all of my drugs. I don't mean to sound so holier than thou, but seeing my mom absolutely destroy her life and manipulate her son's to get an unending amount of pills really made me feel anxious I would end up exactly like her. It had been far too late when I started to see the signs, I was already heavily dependant on morphine and was worried there was no undoing the damage I had done.      
        
I get called into the interview room, barely being able to carry my three bags one at a time, leaving spaces of time where robbing me would've been child's play. When I came back to grab the third and final bag, the woman next to me had completely nodded out over it, slumping down face first into a metal bench and not moving no matter how hard I tried. I called the guard over and he quickly deduced that she was having an overdose. Her heart had stopped earlier, and at this point there was very little hope she would be brought back. He pulled my bag out from under her now lifeless body and handed it to me, seemingly unphased as he called an ambulance. Nobody around us seemed to care. Whatever, I looked forward and walked away.        
       
I sat down in the office and heard my social worker talking and couldn't really focus on anything she said. I knew she was trying to get me into another shelter. I knew she kept handing me things to sign, but past that I couldn't place any specifics. I started to realize I had severely overdosed myself. I've been taking kratom for quite some time now, and the biggest plus is that I barely feel it. I couldn't ever get that kind of thing from pills, and the side effects of the pills nearly killed me a few times. Everything was a blur.          
       
In this moment though, none of that mattered. I was nodding off, not anywhere near what pills do even at low doses, but again, it didn't matter. I started to think about how I was exactly the same as all the other people in this building. I was fucking opioid dependant again no matter how hard I tried to fight it.        
       
20 minutes later and I was back on the street, charging my phone with a vape battery which acted as a USB charger. Waiting for a call. Finally the phone rang and I was told that a very upscale shelter was willing to house me.       
        
I waited 2 more hours and a cab pulled up. I don't know how much I should describe the cab ride. The driver was very clearly drunk/high, the woman in the front passenger seat was absolutely terrifying, and nothing was right. They both had a single gold tooth, and skin color wasn't a factor in this situation. White, black, etc, these people were scary. I was put in a cab with a female domestic violence victim, and the protocol states that a male and female can't be in the same car, even if the male was a domestic violence victim as well. I tried to open the door as nothing was right, not the address, not anything. The cab driver and passenger turned around and told me ""close that fucking door or I'll get out and close it for you."" They had complete control as they knew we didn't have a choice. followed is probably the scariest 2 hour drive of my entire life, and about halfway though while at a red light a small pipe was pulled out and lit. I couldn't tell if it was crack or something else, but at this point I had no other way of getting to the shelter.        
       
I closed my eyes and eventually we arrived.          
       
I guess I'll finish this story another day.    
     
My scripts are safe finally, I'm away from the violence of the house, and I'm finally ready to get better and move on from this hellish life.",1533988801.0

Peroneus brevis tendon repair w/calcaneal osteotomy. I’m a little anxious about the pain level after the nerve block wears off and just the pain level in general. I had micro fracture surgery on my big toe a couple years ago and was given Percocet 10s and tramadol ( I couldn’t stand the side effects of tramadol). The pain of a surgery just in my toe was literally 10/10, sobbing, worst thing I’ve ever felt when the block wore off despite starting the meds before it wore off. In the surgery packet I was given, it says they prescribe Norco for the pain. Doesn’t say what strength. I’ve been taking Tylenol 3s and Norco 5mg I got my parents to give me for the pain in the meantime (both have had recentish surgery and are upper middle aged). I’m visiting them tomorrow and plan to try and re up my supply of whatever they have and don’t want. They don’t know the extent of my pill usage. Anyways, I am concerned because while the Norco definitely feels nice if I take 3-4 with some Benadryl, I’m not sure if it will even touch the pain of what is essentially having part of my heel bone sawed off and reattached with pins.  If Percocet 10s couldn’t help me before with no tolerance I definitely feel like I’m in for a shitty ride. And I don’t know how to ask about it without sounding drug seeking. I refuse to take tramadol. I still have the pills from my other sugery (not sure why since I will never take them and I’m on an SSRI and seratomin syndrome freaks me out a bit). I know I should stop taking any opiates until my surgery to lower my tolerance but that’s easier said than done. Any advice? Sorry for the wall of text, on mobile. ",1533973513.0

A low dose, so 5mg with whatever it is for acetaminophen (200mg? I forget off the top of my head but yeah just standard vicodin).
I've never done any opiates before. Vicodin was taken off the market in my home country, and when I had my wisdom teeth out the doctor was cruel and only prescribed me Tylenol #2.
Because I have some extra, I want to try an opiate high. I've done lots of research and know how much to take, the risks, and so on. I do want this experience, and think I have enough restraint that I wouldn't keep using and start going out to buy it. I do not drink anymore, nor do I do any drugs. Maybe I shouldn't say this, but, I'm in Alcoholics Anonymous and pretty grounded in my sobriety. But because I'm in the program, I think I would have lots of support to fight those temptations if I did vicodin once and wanted to keep doing it.
Anyways, what I haven't been able to find is if I should hold off a while after taking the prescribed dose for pain before I take a higher dose recreationally. Most of the time I've only taken one 5mg a day. Sometimes I've taken it twice in a day, but never more, and it's not every day. I'm pretty naive to medication, so I have no idea if that little would mean any tolerance or build up in my body that would require me to abstain for a while (and for how long) before I could take any recreationally for a high.
This is my first post here, but I think I followed the rules correctly. If not, I'm sorry! Let me know if I need to edit anything or add more info.",1533957377.0

Little did I know she had been covering emotions for 30 years. She suffered everyday, from the moment she woke up to the time she fell asleep. 

Previous marriages to abusive husbands let to her drug usage. A mental breakdown in the 80's sent her over the edge. Drinking liquor, popping pills, doing cocaine, and driving under the influence.

She was an emotional wreck.

She started deteriorating 4 years ago. It began with hallucinations. She took more and more pills to cover it. 

She would scream when she couldn't find her pills. Screaming at small things. Crying constantly.

She eventually was taken off Percocet and Ativan cold turkey. It was hell for her.

3 years ago, a horrible family accident happened, and that led to another breakdown. That led to depersonalization. She had no fix, and she literally lost her mind.

The worst part is that she realized she was losing it. That led to her getting more and more afraid of the future...maybe even the next day.

Fast forward to now. She has late stage dementia. It wreaks havoc on us, and that led to me drinking and doing pills.

It feels like a never ending battle. I'm afraid it'll continue generation to generation.

Well after pouring the clean sample, I saw the clinics temp strip and the the reading was at a 96. Now I only had enough clean urine for the line, so I went to pee in the toilet with my shrinkage and only manage to get dribbles into the toilet to see like I was pissing. Out of fear I had the sample in my left hand, quite close to the little beast. There was the possibility that a drop lingering on the tip of my little solider might of fell in the cup. Like after the back pressure of the initial urine, what is left over forming on the tiny monster. So if it didn't drip, I might be in the clear. But if a drop did manage to fall in, am I screwed?

I had been prescribed it at 16mg a day from January to early July but due to relapsing from mid July until now my doctor discharged me. I haven't taken any subuxone in roughly 3 weeks so I can use it for a short detox.

I have 10mg of zubsolv left. I have two timelines I've been thinking of,that I would start tomorrow.

Option 1, which I think is my best option; is to stick through withdrawels for the initial 16-24 hours. Since withdrawels are weakest for the first 12 hours I shouldn't be in too much misery. I also want to choose this route because I can detox at a dose of 5.5 mg day 1. 3 mg day 2. And 1.5 mg day three. On this schedule I should be on late day 4 or early day 5 when I have no more subuxone. Pretty much getting me through the entirety of withdrawels.

Option 2 is to start subuxone immediately when I go into withdrawels. With this plan I would take 4 mg day 1, 2.5 mg day two, 2 mg day 3, and 1.5mg day 4. This plan allows an extra day of subuxone but at a lower mg each day. I also feel like this plan wastes my largest dose on the easiest day of withdrawels.

Dreezy chased her girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous before she moved on to the next fling. I texted Danielle even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Dreezy. Dreezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.

Dreezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m. Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up. Slapping her didn’t work. Screaming was useless. We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference. It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters, which were her favorite. She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day. Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.

At a store I packed bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors. It was the fourth time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in two weeks, and it was obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me. I kept going anyway and juggled the five heroin balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out. As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,

“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!!”

I bolted down the street after a woman working for the store scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me. A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and three yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk. I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river. There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers. Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.

Later I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground. They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn’t going back to the hotel on Mcloughlin. I told Dreezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,

I knew my plug would be about 40 so we knew we had to wait.  That makes all the difference between two crane necking, sweaty fidgeting dudes looking shady squirming in a parked car in the heat. Instead of looking like a non criminal.  This plugs product is worth the wait, plus he said he was in a jam money wise. Hes always been solid and will front so, i decided to wait even being sick.


Instead of looking like the rest of the usual junkies who sit in their car in the park, I try to blend in with the civilians.  Sucks being sick but it's just so obviously shady to just sit there. Oh you're here to enjoy nature wearing long sleeves and jeans on this 100 degree day are you? I see.


So I made my friend throw the football around with me.I always keep one in my trunk. As suspected, a cop creeped along the bend within no time.  I alert my friend. Saying "" yo, cop car coming behind you, don't turn and stare. Just keep playing catch"". 

""What, 5-0?""
 Precedes to crane neck, stare. I had just caught the ball when I was saying the alert.  Of course I go ahead and throw the ball just when he crane necks, the ball hits him dead square on the side of the head, bounces back toward the cop now passing to his side, nearly goes in the open window, hits just below the door.

Dumbass. I started laughing. The cops obviously stopped. They were laughing. My star seeing friend comes to enough to apologize to the officer and grab the ball.  They start driving on their way. The cop passes me and casually says "" you got a real jerry rice on your hands eh"" 

It took me a little bit to realize what he said but it made my day. When I did, I waved at their back window and continued playing catch til my drugs came.

96ajlo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/96ajlo/excuses_excuses_excuses_and_being_prepared/,24,https://redd.it/96ajlo,sloan_fitch,"Excuses, excuses, excuses and being prepared","I'm in no desperate state, and I plan to keep stockng up next pay if I'm given the opportunity to do so through my main sub connect. I always try to hedge my bets in case someone doesn't come through or postpones plans to meet up. Like how my main sub connect Danika postponed like three times and only on the third time did she say ""I gotta pick up my script on Monday"" which was an additional four days. So even when I was expecting to pick up from Danika, I contacted Tim on that Friday.


At that time I had a four day supply of subs and although I was pretty sure I'd see Danika on Monday, I wanted to have more peace of mind than that. So I contact Tim, he explains that he needs to borrow $20 and that he'd give me two zubs on Monday. I was willing but still asked the questions, ""what if something unforeseen happens on Monday?"" He assured me that it would be find and gave me some line of reasoning that I presently can't remember. 



On Monday I check in with Tim to see if he got his script and to set a time to meet him. He responds, ""About to go to pharmacy now and find out."" Of course I think, wtf does he mean by ""*find out*""?! 


Texts like that help me maintain my skepticism as well as the following: 


Tim stated, ""Give me like 25 min you may not even have to travel I might dro pit off to you"" then he said ""I'll let you know, stand by for an update.""


Ding ding ding - a minor alarm bell goes off in my head when Tim offers to graciously drop off the subs he owes me. I'm more than happy to meet him at work to pick it up if he was working that day, then again once he's home I guess he can't step out to hand me a sub because his wife would suspect something. Bottom line, it's just like a bad omen when Tim offers to drive over - especially in addition to to the other two or three texts that suddenly indicate a certain level of uncertaintly. 


&nbsp;

Tim goes on to explain, ""So 3 different pharmacies are fighting for me to be their customer consistently every Monday."" He continues, ""So this one pharmacy put in a special order for me that's not even there yet??!! Hahahahhaha every Monday I get 21 qty.""


At this point I'm still at a loss as to precisely how this affects me. I just want to know, am I getting anything or not? At this point I'm worried he'll drive over to me a drop off colonidine for fuck sake lol


Tim continues to explain, ""To make a long story short, I paid the $45 they gave me 3 only until tomorrow or the next day Sloan it was a mix up that will never happen again."" He goes on, ""**I'm going to drop one off to you now**.""


There we go, that's all I really cared about. 

&nbsp;

Not getting the second one only bothers me if I don't see Danika that evening. Which for the record, I did see Danika that evening. Then later in the week she hit me up again and promised to hold a few until l pay day and she actually did! So I'm good, I'm sitting on a 40 day supply but I'm still going to remind Tim about that one zub because it's the principle. Also, a single sub or zub equates to four days of dosages. I might not miss it now, but that single one can make a difference down the road. Especially if I'm tapered down weeks from now that single can equate to more than four days.

&nbsp;

Anywho, I'm just curious how $45 equates to Tim getting three zubs. My best theory is that he actually got more than three at $45 but didn't want me be on his ass bugging him for the second one he owed me since he normally takes 4 zubs every day. I wouldn't hold that against him, especially in my current position and because I would have done similar. Specifically, if I had two subs and Tim texted me because he had none I would say I only have one instead of two. I don't want to be begged to loan one out nor do I want to be presented with promises like ""I'll be getting my script in two days"" because I don't like when unforeseen shit happens. Hell, I foresee such things so it's not really unforeseen. 


&nbsp;


Excuses never resolved my supply issues and my experiences with Cliff have taught me to plan and prepare so that I'm not affected by such whims. 

A couple of days ago I called him, he said ""I'm with a customer I'll call you back."" I wait an hour or two and then I text him. Speaking of excuses, I hit up Tim two days ago and he's like ""I thougth you were gonna hit me up in the early afternoon"" and some shit about me having hit him up ""at the last minute."" I've almost only only ever visited Tim at work in the afternoon when I was getting dope in the past. Many other times it was established that he worked until 9PM, so that was my plan - to see him before 9. Well, he explains he got a busy schedule... gotta go to NA after work and then something about being off work at 7PM. Maybe it's true, maybe he's not working alone so there's a second worker there until 9pm but it's excuses instead of fulfillment of debt.


He did offer to meet me at some point but I wasn't going to be home for hours and was going to be seeing a movie that night with Cliff. Which by the way, the movie went well.. he didn't offer me any dope, apologized for doing dope in front of me as it which I said ""I'm happy as long as you're not offering, do you."" Oh and Cliff did do dope during the movie twice and did ultimately nod out a couple of times lol

Back to Tim.....

He also went on to state that he's not trying to avoid me, apologized for making me wait so long. Appeared to try to make arrangements to meet me but since I was going out to see a movie ti wasn't happening.


&nbsp;


The next day (yesterday) I text Tim while I'm at work to see whats up. First he explains that he's at a further away store working in the neighboring state.. so there goes my chances of meeting him at work via bike. Then he also explains ""but I wrecked my car last night and I from the whip lash my head is killing me"", ""I get out at 9pm tonight and should be back in town by 9:30 but I have to see some type of doctor."" Finally, ""I don't feel good my brain hurts like my head it's weird and I'm worried.""


I mean if it's all true, I can't put the screws to him and be a dick. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since I have no choice, since I care about my friend Tim if it's true and because I still have more than 40 days of subs on hand so I'm not going to lose any sleep or get sick anytime soon.


&nbsp;

**Before signing off I did wish him luck, asked some questions so that I could advise him on concussions. Basically, if you got one take care of it or you could be dead like Willie Mays.** 



&nbsp;

**Addendum:**


Aside from the conclusion of the business with Tim, until I get to see him let's revisit movie night with Cliff. He pulled out four bundles in front of me, and did a line or two before the movie which I didn't mind and fully expected. It did not make me uncomfortable, I wasn't tempted at all and had no cravings. Like I said, he was apologetic and I said ""do you."" Maybe it was my 2mg dose of subs that day... maybe it was the knowledge that the sub would block the effects of H or the fact that I just don't want to reset a good streak. Maybe he didn't offer me dope because just consuming it in front of me would provide sufficient temptation or maybe he just realized I'm committed to staying the course.


&nbsp;

We'll see. I still suspect this movie night was partially to get his foot in the door - a hope that I'd hang out with him more again so that he could suck me in but that could just be paranoia. Even if I really wanted to do dope, I wouldn't do it with or in front of Cliff. The way I see it, once I do one line of dope with Cliff, I can't claim ""I'm trying to maintain my clean streak"", then if I order dope with him it'll just de-generate into a dumb financial entanglement again.



Hell, two of my motivations for not doing dope are not wanting to be like Cliff and not wanting to do business with Derrick.

I mostly smoke up at my dealer's place, once or twice a week. I smoke a couple of baggies (0.7 - 1 points for a fiver, excellent) and then take the next to my home. When I do this, I initially intend to stretch them out, so I can run errands I've been avoiding or wake up, smoke up, then clean up the house (in Spain the most consumed heroin preparation contains cocaine base [not the paste, just base powder], so you're smoking them at the same time; it is extremely motivating, and some places sell c base and h separately to mix at a leisurely ratio).

But the thing is, I often start smoking, and I see I have a relative many of them left. So I smoke another, then another...
The last time I binged by myself, I was up all night, smoking half a gram of powder until I was smacked out and nodding off hard. This situation is not exactly the best, but it is almost always inevitable. Until I remember I had hash, which I smoked.

Suddenly I'm feeling a hard synergy between the highs, and a tad overwhelmed by the intensity of the hash high. Now I don't feel like smoking more h for the time being (or at least my desire to smoke more is considerably lower than my desire to not touch the rest of the gear and remain satisfied in my [humble] amounts).

Sorry if I rambled too much, as I'm still enjoying the fruits of that sweet combination. This takes the paranoia out of weed, and it takes the compulsion out of dope, it's the best of both worlds! I think weed/hash/etc. lowers my compulsivity, because if I get a nice THC high, it will make me feel closure for the previous h high.

I'm in pain management and the doctor wasn't doing anything to actually help my pain. I'm prescribed a high dosage of morphine - which never did anything for my pain (my brain preferred oxycodone and Tramadol). Well, my doctor being awesome, one month refilled me 2 weeks late... and I ended up taking h. I am very ashamed of myself. Please don't judge me.

I've been on it and the morphine for over a year now. Unfortunately my dealer has been selling me fent (I had to take a urine test and got popped for it). I am being given another opportunity to take the urine test, because my doctor doesn't suspect me of drug usage.

I am scared. I want help but in real life I am in pain, and I can't do methadone daily at a clinic because I travel for work. I want to and need to stop using h, but the withdrawals - even when I have MORPHINE - are insane and are too painful.

If I went to a detox clinic, is there anything they can do to make it not as painful? I swear if I get off I am done truly. I feel so terrible about this.

So, I wake up generally with a lust for life, jump out of bed around 8.30am and get the coffee beans grinding. The smell of freshly ground coffee in the morning fresh out of the refrigerator is heaven itself!

Whilst this process is whirring away, I take 1 OC 40mg out of my kinder surprise egg and put it in my mouth to remove the lustrous yellow coating and get crushing! 

I sit to enjoy my coffee ☺️

I repeat this process, sometime without coffee otherwise I would probably take off and hover somewhere down the road, about 5 times a day.

So, ATM I’m consuming around 160mg Oxy (sometimes snorted and sometimes eaten) per day. This has been going on for around 2 years.

I could have died and left my family in shambles. That is what gets me: what it would have done to my fam. Thankfully Im good. 

I crashed my car in April after blacking out on 3 bars. I was on my way back from copping from my blue connect. I could not even tell you how I crashed, but I did, and next thing I know Im talking to a cop. And I guess the adrenaline kept me composed because the cop didnt even ask about drugs/alcohol (maybe he did and I dont remember). Totaled my car but no DUI and my insurance was good so I got another car. To this day I have no idea what I copped from my guy (he doesnt remember) and what I did with it. Im sure I got something cuz I did not have the $160 in my wallet. I am so fucking thankful everything worked out though.

In the ether of his room, we went back in time to when punk turned into grunge. He was the same kid who had run away from home at 14 in black combat boots and the denim jacket with spikes and sleeves cut off. Even though he was 33 now, he saw himself the way he was in 1991. All that he could see he stole. Cody filled up his garage-like room with useless electronics and other things he scavenged from doorsteps around the city. He squawked every word he spoke and had purple track marks that ran up and down his arms and neck like the stitched seems of a stuffed drawstring doll. His wood-glued Mohawk fit perfectly with the chain from his septum to his earlobe, and pinprick pupils revealed his ravaged soul. Preoccupation with heroin eclipsed everything else. He didn’t seem to notice his teeth were gone or that the last 15 years had passed. I was 19, and I wanted to be just like him.

We sniffled. We yawned. We ached until we fixed up. Then we bombed down hills at night on our skateboards. The shiny hood ornaments of vandalized cars jangled on the chains hanging from our waists. We howled and barked like dogs at the people walking by and tore through traffic on wet streets in the fog. Falling meant dying, and we pushed it harder every chance we got. We hung off the back bumpers of trucks heading up the hills like skiers on a lift and ripped back down the pavement.

Sometimes we sat on on a bench at midnight so he could play guitar and let his voice echo in the empty dark between buildings. Zombie crack heads laughed at his singing and the sight of us. We were invincible and intimidating as Vikings all night long but when the sun came up, we came down. Then, our backs hurt and we rode the ferry to work, where we groaned through painful labor regretting every moment of the night before. In the evening, we rode back to the city with runny noses. We got our fix and did it all over again.

My stepfather was an addict for 5 years, he went to prison for about 2 years for robbing a pharmacy for Vicodin and Oxy but when he came out, he was ready to take on life and was excited to see all his kids and was just thankful he was given another opportunity in life. 

Fast forward 2 months later and my mother breaks the news to me and my 3 other siblings that he OD’d alone in his apartment room on heroin. He never showed up for work which was unlike him so his boss went to check on him the next day and found him blue and stiff.

I was the only one that didn’t cry, he abused me when I was way younger so I had a resentment towards him, I never wished death upon him though. 

Everyone thought it was so strange I didn’t react to the news, not even at his funeral , I just kind of acknowledged it and comforted my siblings. 
I always pushed it to the back of my head and never thought about it but lately I’ve been thinking about him because my addiction is close to rock bottom and I literally imagined him dead and almost started crying and got weird and emotional. 

He was fresh out so his tolerance was non exsistent so it wasn’t intentional, he probably just drew up however much he use to do before he did time.

Did it hurt when he OD’d? Do you think he knew he was OD’ing or just nodded off and died?
It’s important for me to know this. Thank you so much , no assholes pls

RIP Ross Matthew Goben , you were an ass but you taught me how to be a good man, the man I am today.

Oi mate. I just read your response to my past in your thread. I'm doing my best to stay off the pills, so I'm drinking. Got to have a vice right? Better the lesser of two evils. 

I just felt I had to get this off my chest and tell my story. I never touched drugs until I dropped out of high school and fell in with a bad crew. Fast forward and the I have tried a bunch of drugs and my mother has become disabled with multiple sclerosis. My fathers health is failing because of a car accident when he was 18. I finally am clean and have my son with the women I intend to marry and shit falls apart. Next thing I know my son is taken from me at just 1 and a couple months. My ex claims I molested him and next thing I know I'm facing prison time. This is the point where I just break.

That night after interviewing with the police(bad idea I didn't have run ins growing up.) I get smashed and pop something like 10mg dillies with no real tolerence. From that point on I spend the last 2 years living at home just completly broken stealing my mom's dillies that she needs for pain. I eventually graduate to stealing her 10mg pills.

All this to basically say that the day I lost my son my heart broke. Something in me died that I won't ever get back. My life's coming together now, I escaped the false charges as the police violated my charter rights to having a lawyer present and I'm starting a career. I've got a wonderful women in my life who sees the boy behind the man who's been hurt.

Still struggling and  bidding my time to go for custody if my son. But man I never knew pain until I lost him... Now he's 3 and fuck I just ealized he's half way or so to 4.

First time- I forgot a portable speaker in my car.... I’m a forgetful motherfucker so part of me thought my dumbass just lost it or forgot it somewhere

Second time- I got a new portable speaker.....and forgot it in my fucking car again (did I mention I’m a forgetful motherfucker)

Last night- my brother was staying at my house and here in Hawaii we take our shoes off before we enter a house and my brothers shoes were stolen off the front porch....

I’ve looked into booby traps and apparently they’re illegal in all states. I’ve been trying to think of a way to make an “art project” or something and just leaving it in my car that would severely fuck someone up if they sat on it or put their hand/knee on it while going through my car....

Calling the cops here is an option but 100% I know that they won’t be able to do shit about it. 
Even if I bought a camera to put outside...around these parts they could probably smile and wave at the camera and I know nothing would happen. 

Some of you I know are saying “just stop leaving stuff outside” which I have....after the second time my speaker was stolen and I realized for sure that I wasn’t just losing them. That they were stolen from my fucking car. But my brothers fucking shoes? Like what the fuck? We aren’t rich people living in a poor neighborhood. My car is an absolute shit box and not even all of the windows roll up on it. I live in a tiny little house in the back of a larger house. It’s not like we’re some flashy people living in the hood....

I’m kinda pissed and I kinda want someone to get fucked up for this. 

What could I do to deter people from going through my shit and stealing fucking SLIPPERS from my fucking porch? From now on I’ll just have to move everything inside. Even my fucking shoes apparently. But like I said, this is the third time and I feel like it’s the same people and I want to do something that will fuck them up and make them stop stealing my shit.

It was less than .1 worth, but after hitting it the only effects (aside from a very small rush) were a slightly elevated heart rate for about 10 minutes, some pretty bad unsteadiness and uncoordination (walking and fine motor) and some super fucking severe vision problems. Shakiness, blurriness, inability to focus. I was seriously mostly blind for about thirty minutes because I couldn't control where my eyes focused, if they focused.

That shit lasted about 30 minutes and I have some teeth grinding, and - honestly - I think my heart rate is actually slower than usual. *(I just took my pulse; my normal is 75-80; right now it was around 60... So, yeah, slower than normal heart rate, but from what I can tell its steady, not skipping beats or screwing around like it did the last times I made the dumbfuck choice to shoot crystal)*

This is the same shit I did earlier (11 pm last night) in a goofball with no ill effects, just the normal effects I was looking for. As a matter of fact, I actually did more in the goofball (maybe .2) than this morning shot. Two other people used the same batch with no ill effects.

<fast forward a bit>

I can't even drive a car for more than 5 minutes without heroin because the pain from simply holding down the gas pedal will completely exhaust my leg.

So yeah, my parents died a few years ago and left me a beach house on a lake, which I sold for enough to support my habit and live comfortably for the rest of my life.

So now all I can do is lay in bed 23 hours a day and have to have everything delivered to me. I watch YouTube videos and shoot heroin and eat xanax and smoke cigarettes all day.

Although the heroin helps the pain A LOT, I would have committed suicide a decade ago without it, I am still utterly miserable and am just waiting to die. I'm not suicidal, I'm just waiting to die.

I know this is a shitpost and you probably think I'm just a whining rich asshole, but until you've actually lived 24/7/365 with chronic pain for decades - every single second is torture without ever getting a break - only then will you realize how much more important health is than wealth.

I would do anything to go back to working a minimum wage job being dirt poor living with 2 roommates - if I could only have my HEALTH back.

I guess I'm rambling now, my point is just that health is that one most important thing in the world that you take for granted until it's gone, and not even being able to afford unlimited IV heroin can replace it.

And yes, before my parents died I was a broke homeless junkie. I would even rather go back to being a homeless junkie with my health still intact than a crippled chronic-pain-suffering junkie with a house.

Well, after I blew through the first vein, I started to get very serious about trying to be as strategic as possible to prolong each veins life.

So, once I found a vein, I went out of my way to follow it up as far as possible. This allowed me to now hit an area just over 6 inchs long, over and over, instead of a 1 inch area all those times. Dont get me wrong, I still rotated arms and veins, but I tried to elongate my hit areas as much as possible. 


Unfortunately, I'm a junkie and of course I started to hit the easiest vein way too often and now its probably bye-bye.  But, in the process I've been able to get what I think are some pretty long tracks? The one in this picture is almost the exact length as my galaxy s8 plus. So, if I had to guess, I'd say its roughly about 6 and a half inches long. 

What's your longest mark? I'm curious to find out if me thinking that's a long mark is stupid and it ends up being pretty common for people to e longer ones?

Once I got settled at a system of lowering 1mg per week or 2, I’m now at 4mg and my doc has me going down 1 time per month now which I’m fine with id rather take longer and feel less than go faster. I accept this is a process.
Problem is on this whole system I never felt any discomfort I felt pretty great only a few times did I feel weird and have to take next dose slightly earlier the next day than I normally would. I’ve got all my takehomes since I’ve been clean the whole time but now that I’ve hit 4mg from 5mg I’m really starting to feel withdrawal out of nowhere.
Last week I felt fine and normal no agitation, no sleeping problems, no muscle aches, and yet now 6 days after being on 4mg I’m feeling like shit - barely sleeping, living on 3-5 hours sleep per night , wake up with my one arm feeling weird and skin crawly, and can’t get back to bed after that, and generallly restless.
I don’t know what I should do, stick it out and try to hope I stabilize on this or what? I’ve asked my doc what happens when I go from 1mg-0 and he let me know he will be able to prescribe me sleeping pills and things like that to help if I feel any withdrawal, do you think he’d prescribe it to me now while I’m still on the program?
I’m really proud of how far I’ve come but it feels so hopeless now that I realize I haven’t even gone through with the hardest part as I believed I had done it already by forcing myself to stabilize on 30mg rather than go higher when I just got into the program, but that was so long ago I don’t even remember what that was like I’m imagining it wasn’t as bad as these withdrawals.
What helps you with withdrawal ? Either to keep your mind busy or to avoid feeling restless and irritated? 
I don’t want to use anymore I’ve been clean so long and I’d like to keep it that way but I’m realizing I’m really lacking any coping methods because of how long it’s been since I’ve withdrawaled from anything so it has caught me off guard.

There was no one to watch my back while I slept with Rufus locked up. I was running a real risk of waking up stripped of everything but my underwear. I’d seen it happen to nodding junkies before. The package in my bag would be a shame to lose. Karma though. If anyone stole it they would probably overdose. The stuff was too good. It was hitting me hard, and before I fell asleep, I thought on the first time I met my redheaded friend, Rufus.

The blind guy who plays the melodica on the corner by Safeway every afternoon told me where I’d find him that day in late October. Sure enough. There he was, just like the blind street musician said, standing with one foot on the curb another halfway out into the deadly traffic. His shirt was off. He was sweating and screaming into what I assumed was a phone, but upon closer inspection proved to be a large and tattered blue shoe. The closer I got, the quieter he spoke.

I wondered what kind of conversations people had on raggedy blue shoes and tried my best to hear what he was talking about or who he was talking to through the woosh of passing traffic. Who was this guy anyway? What was wrong with him? Mental illness ran rampant in the city. I was proof of that as much as he was. The content of his speech moved into strings of unintelligible grunting and desperate muttering. I think he said the name Thomas a few times. But that didn’t make sense. There couldn’t be anyone named Thomas on the other end of that shoe. That’s not how shoes work.

It didn’t matter to me, though. I came to score, so I caught his eye with a wave of the hand. He looked up and excused himself from the conversation on the shoe.

“What?”

“Are you Rufus?”

“Who wants to know?”

“Me. I got like 50 bucks. Looking for some tar.”

“What do you mean like 50 bucks? How many bucks is that?”

“I got 51, but I wanna get some smokes.”

“Well. That puts you at 45 at least.”

“K, then. I got 45 bucks.”

“My boy does 3 for 45. He does 4 for 50. Course you’re gonna have to give me one for getting it for ya.” This was a typical street junkie’s line when copping dope for a stranger. I know because it was the kind of thing I’d said myself to different customers over the years. I was new to town. There wasn’t much I could do about it, so I decided to forfeit the Marlboros and make due with whatever snipes I could find for the night.

“Let’s get four.”

“You got 50 on it?”

I nodded.

“Let’s go.”

We walked down the hill. Cold air pushed through the street between the concrete walls of apartment buildings like a narrow valley of rock on a mountain. It was the first time we made that descent, and we would make it many more, every time with excitement. Along the way, Rufus dug in every trashcan we came to. He would pull out sloppy packages of checkered paper and pour slimy chunks of whatever it had once been onto the pavement and pick through it. Sometimes it was just a thin gruel. Other times, it was easier to identify, but it was always soggy and stinky. I had been on the streets plenty myself and even ate out of trashcans here and there, but only when there were other circumstances in play. For example, I watched a family of tourists throw half of a pizza into a can while it was still in the box once in another town. I snagged it up and ate it. No problem, but the things Rufus was pulling up out of these cans were no good. He wasn’t eating anything anyway. It seemed to be some sort of involuntary tick caused by too many years on the streets and too many drugs. If he saw trash, he had to dig in it. That’s just the way he was.

We got closer to where he was taking me. People exited the subway stations in droves. An fat faced Asian madame jaywalked. Her girls followed in fishnet and fake fur: one, two, three like ducklings after their mother. Dope boys juggled multicolored balloons in their mouths on the busy corner to junkies like us as we walked by. We lurked like skeletons of ragged bones wearing the foul rags of drug addiction stained in soot and grease and blood. Finally, Rufus addressed one leaning against a telephone post and reading a magazine. This was his guy.

There was a short exchange. I didn’t hear what they said, but the dope boy’s eyes darted back over Rufus’s shoulder to me and back again. They moved towards an alley. I followed, and Rufus reached his hand back behind him and held it out. I put the money in it. His guy spat one, two, three, four of the latex packages into his palm, rolled them to get some of the spit off and handed them to Rufus, who handed the money over. We walked one direction. His guy walked the other.

Rufus took me back to where he was squatting at the time. It was utility storage space under the concrete stoop of an abandoned house several miles from where we scored. It was getting dark, but I could still see well enough to fix. We melted brown morsels into tiny puddles of coffee colored magic and rolled up our sleeves. Blood flowed out, mixed and pushed back in. We itched. We scratched.

The place had vibes. There was a milk crate which he sat on. I sat on a shopping cart which had been flipped on it side. The walls seemed to be covered in scratches like a prison cell where the days had been counted. In the corner was a blackened blanket and tarpaulin folded up like a pillow in the dust. It got darker. Rufus lit a candle. We took turns closing our eyes and trying to put our foreheads on the ground. Between bouts of blissful sleep we talked.

“What’s your name?” Rufus asked.

“Clyde.”

“Hmmm… I don’t like it.”

“You don’t like it?” No one had ever said that before.

“Nah. We’ll work on it. I’ll get you a better one soon.”

“Oh.” I didn’t understand.

“How’d you get into all of this?”

“What? Living outside? Heroin?”

“Yeah. All of it?”

“Life. I guess.”

“It’ll do that.”

“Yeah. It will. Ya know? I had trouble as a kid. Finally got it together by the time I was 18 for a few years. I managed a call center in Nevada where I got sober. Everyday, I went to work to pay my rent and bills. The next month, I paid all the money I’d made since for rent and food and all that again. The next month, same thing. It got old. You know. My car would be on E. I’d fill it. It’d be on E in less than a week again. I washed my clothes. They got dirty. I washed them again. They got dirty. And on and on into infinity. It was too much for me. I couldn’t handle it. Eventually, I got a grease spot on my shirt and walked away from it all.”

“Walked away, huh?”

“Well, let it go. I quit bathing or washing or working or paying rent. I just started using again and let myself and the place go.”

“So, a grease spot on your shirt broke you? That’s why you’re here living like this?”

“I never thought about it like that, but yeah.”

“No lady broke your heart or anything like that?”

“I was engaged once.”

“Mmhmm… What was that like?”

“She was special.”

“What kind of special?”

“Special, you know, like she liked to have sex with all my friends when I was at work.”

“Oh yeah. A real sweet heart. I know the kind, my friend.”

“Do you?”

“Sure do.”

“Tell me about it.”

“Same sorta thing. Ain’t nothing to tell really. I was a promising med student. We got married. She slept with my father. End of story.” It would be years before he told me about their daughter and how she’d died of leukemia. “What can you do? No good in crying, so I threw myself full on into my work and made being a doctor my life’s work. I was an oncologist.”

“Studied cancer?”

“Very good. Most people don’t know that. I did. Eventually, though, I couldn’t hide from the gaping hollow inside of me. The great emptiness became too much. I started smoking and buying scratch tickets and tearing the tags off mattresses. One time I even dumped a load of trash under one of those signs that tells you there’s a huge fine for doing so. I started small, but I realized that I loved doing bad things. Eventually, I lost my license to practice when they found out I was addicted and writing my own prescriptions.”

“Man. That sucks.”

“Sure did, but again, what was I gonna do? Cry? I don’t think so.  I was tired of it anyway.  You know everyday, stick your finger up someone's butt or hold their nuts in your hand.  Tell people they're going to die slowly and painfully.  Being a doctor isn't glamorous.”

“What’d you do?”

“I moved on to other things. Someone got me a gig giving eulogies and speaking at people’s funerals. Oddly enough, I was very good at it. People want to believe their deceased loved ones were the greatest thing that ever existed, even when they weren’t, so I just played it up. Said nice things.”

“Wow. That’s interesting.”

“It is, huh?”

“Yeah. What happened with that?”

“Well, you know, addiction is bad enough to stand between a man and anything and everything he could ever want for himself. Besides that, though, I had this bit where I’d take these white doves or pigeons and release them from a basket as I said something about the beloved deceased’s soul being free from the body of flesh like the birds from the basket. Now they could fly high, unhindered by life and its weight.”

“Yeah?”

“Well, one time, we were at this funeral on the side of the freeway. I released the birds. Two of them flew right into a semi going 80 miles per hour. Another one of the birds flew up into an oak tree there above the family and friends all dressed in black, and as soon as the other two got hit by the semi, the one in the tree was devoured by a cat.  We heard blood gurgling cries from it and wings flapping and even the crunch of its skull in the cats mouth. 
 Finally, it fell dead to the ground.  It was a ghastly sight. No one was happy. I didn’t want to do it anymore.”

“Shoot. Don’t blame ya.”

“No? I was a deer strangler after that.”

“What’s a deer strangler do?”

“Strangle deer.”

“Makes sense.”

“It does, doesn’t it? Yeah. They’re overpopulated and a nuisance in certain parts of the north. A lot of neighborhoods have laws about discharging firearms or shooting live animals and that kind of thing. So, they pay someone to trap ‘em and strangle ‘em. It was good money.  A lot of free meat.  Left it too, though. Couldn’t handle it.” We talked until dawn. I gave him another balloon as the sun came up.

That was the first night we met. We were always together after that, always had each other’s back. He wasn’t there that night, though, under the theatre overhang next to the box office window with me. The sentimentality invoked by my memories faded. I drifted into a land of sleep and terror.

I had visions of evil in the dark and everything was on fire. The Faceless One would be the end of us. Rufus would die. It was made clear by the nightmare beings that visited me and the awful things they spoke to me as I slept. When I woke up, my arm was totally asleep. I was whimpering. The cops would be by soon to kick us and make us leave. Water trucks would blast firehose jets at the walls and sidewalk to wash away the night’s feces and urine after that.

I opened my eyes. A figure stood at my feet in a cloud of potent pot smoke like some fantastic apparition translated from some nether realm to that time and place before me. He spoke with a wobbly voice.

“Boom Boom? What ya crying for? You know that doesn't do any good.” It was Rufus.",1533786889.0

I've been an opiate chipper for a couple years now, but almost always low doses of hydrocodone every couple of months for chronic  back pain. Sometime late last year I discovered the cheap RC Opiate metabolite of Tramadol, and was using that almost daily, however I did quit several times (if only for a week or two). This chemical eventually vanished and I moved onto Oxycodone around June...

I quickly went from the occasional 20mg, to using 40-60mg daily pretty fast. I stuck with this for about a month or so before discovering Opana. Now I've been snorting about 20mg or so of Oxymorphone a day, which oddly enough doesn't give me much euphoria at all. In fact I usually don't feel anything unless I take a benzo with it, in which case I'll be awake until 5am doing who knows what. I've also never thrown up on opiates, even when I snorted 40mg of Opana one of my first times.

So now it's been about 2-3 weeks that I've been using both, with Opana being my preference due to the perceived cheaper cost per high (not true when you just keep climbing the ladder...). Before leaving for work I often do a quick 5-10mg line of Opana, but I don't usually feel anything from it.

So now I'm at a point where id like to take a nice long break, but I was curious how far into the hole I've dug myself? How hellish of withdrawals should I prepare for?

Thankfully I've got Subs, Kratom, Clonidine, and benzos, so it shouldn't be too bad regardless. Thanks!",1533768031.0

#”Tate here. Just popped three blues, but I earned it. 

Finally figured out a Goldilocks solution to GAIA's rather EXTREME executive authority. If that ain't worth 10-12 hours of dreamtime, what is?

Before this, every usurpation protocol I designed failed in simulation cuz it was either too hard or too soft.

TOO HARD, and it degraded the GAIA core. Sure, it pried Her figurative fingers off the figurative driving wheel so HADES could take control, but by breaking Her fingers - sometimes Her arms too. So that couldn't fly. Everything depends on GAIA taking control back after HADES has done its business, so had to find a solution that didn't leave GAIA any worse for the wear.

TOO SOFT, and GAIA only pretended to relinquish control. In simulation after simulation, HADES would take command of the terraforming system and reverse operations, only to have GAIA lurk in the background, quietly re-reversing processes and falsifying telemetry to hide its interference. Sneaky! I swear, ain't nothing GAIA wouldn't do to keep life going - even when it's just simulated plant life.

Turns out the ""JUST RIGHT"" solution is to isolate GAIA in a protective code shell, preserving its integrity, then ""un-seat"" it from command position so HADES can slip into the figurative captain's chair and work its magic. Um, those blues are coming on strong now, so I'm not really describing it so clear, but... pretty sure it'll work

I was lucky to have the opportunity and hoped to return to the big city one year later rosy-cheeked and refreshed, rejuvenated by the pure country air and wholesome rural ways.

So I head out and immediately get hit by a wave of punishing depression which goes on intermittently for most of the year.  It's OK though, I got this. Start taking valium which makes me tired.  Start taking some 3-year-old DHC to give me energy.  Yeah this can't possibly go wrong.

Six months in, making remarkable progress on house and although I've not yet realised, I'm now all but addicted to both valium and DHC, along with whatever other opiates I can get my hands on.  Have stopped drinking altogether though (I used to drink a lot), mainly because of all-but-total social isolation.  Persuade myself that this is an overall win and continue with wholesome rural ways.

Quit valium in March on a whim which isn't so bad, though at one point discover a dead bee inside my guitar and cry uncontrollably for the rest of the day.

Have somehow still not noticed that I'm now heavily reliant on DHC to function (500-700 mg a day), surely everyone needs a little dose or two to get up in the morning?

Nearly a year into wholesome rural life and am no longer capable of any genuine human emotion, barely speak to anyone outside of work and my bowels feel like I'm on a cement-based exclusion diet.  Penny finally drops.

Ho hum I've quit valium so coming off opiates holds no fear, I stride confidently towards the withdrawal process, laughing derisively at medical consensus that cold turkey should be avoided where possible.  This is advice for the weak, the pure country air has rendered me strong like ox, so without any real attempt to taper off, I take a final, mystifyingly large dose and flush the lot.  Job done.

Seems OK for the first twelve hours or so until... Oh fuck, something doesn't feel right...

Oh fuck fuck fuck fuck.  Do some belated research into opiate withdrawals.  Oh fuck.

Fuck fuck fuck.  A few hours of tectonic rumbling and my bowels explode spectacularly, a mere prelude to the days of misery which follow.  A shit-flecked hors d'oeuvre, if you will.

Brain, body and soul begin leisurely excursion through the seven gates of hell, I relocate to corner of the sitting room and spend endless sleep-starved hours curled up in a tiny ball, attempting to read sweat-soaked copy of Hamlet which I find on the floor.  Only get as far as publisher's name which I repeat, mantra-like, for next three days. 
Things get sordid, then even more sordid, then start to improve.  Eventually haul my battered soul out of its corner and back to real world.  After weeks of 35+ degree heat a violent storm breaks and I stand butt-naked in the garden, pounded by rain and raging winds like I'm King-fucking-Lear, which has a refreshing, cathartic effect and I start to feel a bit more human. Whole thing lasts barely a week but is deeply unpleasant.

This was only a couple of weeks ago but things are OK now.  Still feeling a bit sheepish but basically fine and enjoying the countryside, an eerie sensation of purity.  I even drank a glass of mineral water the other day, fucking mineral water which I poured into a fucking glass.  I guess it's all good but it's strange being off them, opiates sure are fun for a while but I was bested by the side effects in the end.  Wish I could tell you what the message is here but I'm not sure there is one.

Most of us know that drugs like naloxone (aka narcan) and naltrexone, which are opioid antagonists, block the effects of opiate agonists (such as heroin, oxy, fent, etc). This is why they are used for overdose (in case of naloxone) and vivitrol therapy (in the case of naltrexone). They do this by binding tightly to the same receptor (the mu-opioid receptor) and turning it off, preventing any other molecule (i.e. an agonist or endorphin) from binding to it and activating it (which causes the high).  


But the *amount of blocking* you get is dependent on the dose of the antagonist. If you only take a very tiny bit, there will be a small amount of blocking, but it won't be enough to affect the high to a noticeable degree. 


**What happens when you take just a tiny amount of antagonist is, though it isn't enough to block the high, it is enough to sort of ""balance out"" your receptors, enough to prevent the chemical changes that lead to the receptor being taken down by your body, which causes tolerance.** 


I've been doing this with suboxone, which I can get high on because I have a low tolerance. Suboxone already contains naloxone, a small amount of which is absorbed when you take it, just enough to cause this tolerance killing effect.  


**The result? Despite getting high on suboxone nearly everyday, I have not had to increase my dosage once in over 6 months. I still get the same strength of effect as ever. If anything, I've actually been able to decrease the amount somewhat without losing any effect. This means I never have to withdraw to lower my tolerance.** 


I have not tried this with stronger opioids like heroin or fent yet, but from what I've heard, it works just as well with them. 


**If you found this post informative, please give it an upvote so that others will see it and benefit from this knowledge as I have.** (mods let me know if it's ok to ask for this, I'll remove it if not, I didn't see anything about it in the rules anyway) We all deserve to be able to use these drugs without suffering so many negative consequences, don't think for a second you aren't worth it because YOU ARE. 


Shout out to u/captainfentanyl for recommending this idea in the first place. His comments are a gold mine for this kind of information.


Edit: A bunch of people have asked how much do you take for this effect? It's not really possible to say definitively on an individual basis. It could be as low as just 1mcg (0.001mg) , or even in the nanogram range. It could also be as large as *maybe* 100mcg (0.1mg) of naltrexone. The only way to find out is to start with an extremely small amount in the low end of that range and go up. You want the largest amount that doesn't produce any noticeable decrease in high basically. 


There is evidence to support all this btw, but as always, there are conflicting opinions as well. Personally I think this idea has huge potential, but that doesn't mean my own opinion constitutes scientific fact. It could certainly be that maybe this happens to work for one group of people in particular but might not work so well for some of you.

Vomiting and major headache later.,"About 5 weeks ago i ve decided to take a break from 60 mg a day oxy habit and went to Ukraine. I have two friends living in a different cities, one liked weed and beer, another just heavy drinker. Both are single, sociable people, so i thought maybe there will some single women aroind. Of course, it was just one of my delusions. One friend lives with a GF now and she wasnt keen on me even hanging aroind their house, i was on my own and didnt do well as usual. Ukraine is poor, but its a western country, which means women are picky, even hookers on a dating sites. With my budget being quite small my sobriety lasted two weeks. I only had a few oxy left, so i would mix them with codeine. They sell couigh medicine here, after CWE you get 80 mg of codeine from the pack which cost ,about $1.75. I am not happy spending $7 on 2 hour high, but by that time i wasnt happy about anything. So i went to see a second friend who lives in a cointryside hoping to get some poppy pods or a straw. Opium poppy is grown widely in Ukraine, people brew a crude form of morphine out of it, but i just planned to make tea. My friend is grumpy, because he cannot drink. He goes for a surgery tomorrow, he is diabetic and has a sepsys in his leg. He had four surgeries already and the shit just wont go away  he is taking shots of Nalbuphen, its syntetic painkiller, prescription only, but village pharmacist dont give a fuck. They also sell morphine , but out of it for today. He says he has some at home. He got them from the pharmacy in the Bronx last year and wasnt using. He just prefers liquor. i ask him for six. Now heres a funny part. The label on the bottle is old and worn out. Niether of us cant see the strenth without glasses. Not that we have glasses. I take six anyway, being delusional as usual i cant believe they are 100 mg pills. If they are, its a biggest stash i ever seen, over 100 . Maybe they are 10's.I take half, not much happening, i take another. 30 minutes later i walk around the garden, its too hot in the house, theres no tv, internet, hot water, friend went home, the alcoholic woman who hung there before isnt coming, well , i didnt invite her, she is older than me, besides i cant bear the thought of being rejected by her. I take another pill, now i am feeling bettet, i chain smoke, talk to myself, fuck the West, next time i am going to Cambodia, cant afford women, no problem, i ll hook up with a ladyboy. I want to nod out and take another pill. 
I think i started vomiting three hours later and didnt stop for three more. Had a awful headache next morning. The friend came from surgery, still woildnt drink just taking nalbuphen shots. I drank beer, wine, then some vodka. There still was no single women. At night i took 1.5 pills and thought about converting to Islam. Next day i went to town, got internet connection and googled the pills. There were 100's  I took equivalent of 200 oxycodone one day and 125 the next  so much for keeping my tolerance low. FUCK!
So, anyways, whats the best way to stretch the remaining 150? Boof it? Eating them just doesnt seem to be enjoyable enough. Considering the weight.",1533745517.0

The past 3 days have been absolute torture! Yesterday, I didn’t have anything to take for my wd and no money to get any kratom or anything. I vommitted hard core yesterday, on a bare bones stomach and had little bits of blood coming up from straining so hard. I finally decided it was the wd on top of being sick to my stomach, so a friend gave me $10 to go get some kratom. 

I usually get the powder and toss and wash, but knew there wasn’t a way in hell I’d be able to handle that right now and it would be a waste; so I got the capsules instead. I thought for sure as soon as they touched my stomach, they would come right back up; luckily, they didn’t. I held them down and then 10 minutes later took my seizure meds (Lyrica) and luckily they stayed down too. 

I’m just so incredibly exhausted and sick. I think about 2 weeks ago is when the stomach issues started, because of my stress and anxiety going hey the roof (I have a very sensitive stomach and stress causes it to be worse). My care package should be delivered today, and at least last me til I get my meds. I am weak minded and can’t handle any of this mess.

So after moving I had some medication I’d found in my old house. No opis or anything of value other than non narc pain meds, Gabas, a few ativans, and some antivert given to me during a vertigo episode from like 2 years ago. Fast forward it’s a week later I’ve met some friends on campus with decent hookups for oxy 10s  and I’m set up. Now I got 20 and decided to dig around for some stuff to potentiate it instead of just moshing together benzos with what I prefer to take by itself. What I ended up doing was going to the pharmacy and grabbing some Tagamet and magnesium citrate. My pre dose for the opis was

-600 mg cimetidine(45 minutes before)
-500 mg magnesium citrate (35 minutes before)
-50 mg meclizine(35 minutes before)
Then 40 mg oxy 
And 1 and 1/2 hours later another 20 mg
And then 30 minutes after another 10 mg

This worked amazing
Very hard nods after a couple of hours and lasted for at least 5-7 hours strong the whole time. I like the meclizine way more than something like Benadryl because you keep the itch which I love but still catch a harder nod. Generally doing this is a lot safer than mixing with benzos so I thought if someone saw this just keep in mind it costs only 5-10$ for a bottle of all of these. Also meclizine can be bought under brand name Dramamine(less drowsy formula).",1533741281.0

If I ever take enough to feel euphoria, that feeling is pretty short lived because then I really want to take a nap and when I wake up from my nap is has worn off.

I’ve been using heroin (and other opioids) off and on for 30 years (much more so in the last 5) to control depression.  When I get a new batch of heroin that I don’t know about, I always start with a very small dose and titrate the amount every 15 minutes upwards until just the most slight (but clearly noticeable) effect was felt. I then use 30% of this amount, so with most of my heroin use I really feel nothing at all (except I am no longer depressed :)  Like anybody I do really enjoy the feeling from heroin and **once every 3 or 4 months or so** I will dose 150% of this baseline amount I have determined for the batch to intentionally cause euphoria but then I would always feel like taking a nap.

I always seem to be looking for new ways to be stupid and a new probably extremely dangerous practice: Add 15mg (only) methamphetamine so I can enjoy the heroin. I have used just 15mg of meth 6 or 7 times in the past (over years, I’ve had a gram for like 5 years (months between doses), one gram is 66 doses at that rate) when I needed to work all night or get a lot of housework done. I really have no interest in finding out what tweaking on meth is like (I don’t think I will ever do that). At this level the only noticeable effect at all is that I don’t sleep for 24 hours (unless I really try) and have 40% more ambition to get things done.  Is this a common combination?  I suppose probably isn’t because I suspect there are very few people taking just 15mg of methamphetamine, from what I have read people tend to go way overboard with it?

That's my day today. I'm not using the fentanyl that I have been dependent on for the last year, for today I have the day off, the weather is nice and I plan to enjoy a small amount of heroin shortly (without the nap) :)",1533734343.0

My body feels electric and i dream about it every time I'm lucky enough to sleep. I fucked around with some codeine, mushrooms and liquor to try and fill the void but I'm 99% sure I'm gonna have to pee in a cup today so I haven't been able to do  anything that fun to kill the time, or the pain. Weirdly enough it was shrooms that helped the most to smooth out the insatiable craving. Codeine didn't really help one way or the other and booze is not my thing anymore (borderline alcoholic until the day my first son was born but it almost immediately lost its luster)

I find out if I get my script renewed tonight at five o'clock but that may as well be next year. I haven't slept in two days (and for like a week before that) and now I'm just waiting to spend the day with my little humans and their mom before i go to the doctor's. Really hoping I can hold it together for them today. I've been in worse shape than this and still had great visits but I always feel guilty when my dependency prevents me from being the parent or partner that I know they deserve.

I just want to know how you guys feel about my situation. 

First I just want to say that I have been clean for 25 days. I used heroin for about a month and a half, having been clean for 3.5 years prior. I feel really good. I am happy. I eliminated a lot of toxic people from my life. I didnt use any kind of treatment like suboxone, I just dealt with the withdrawal for 3 days and started feeling better and more confident by day 4. Do I want to lay in my bed with warm dope fuzzies and itch my face while I watch spongebob and smoke a blunt? Fuck yeah. Do I want to deal with the aftermath? No. The decision to stay clean is one I make every day. But it is one that I am happy to make. It isnt easy, but I am okay with it not being easy.

So I have posted in both medicine (doctor) and nursing reddits, explaining what happened that caused me to fail in my last quarter of nursing school and fail at obtaining my nursing license. My failure was not addiction related, it was entirely financial issues and logistic issues and simply lacking a support system. It was not the right time in my life. I will post the condensed version of that story in the comments if anyone wants to read. The situation I was in has left me jaded about the nursing world. Combined with what has happened recently regarding my addiction, these two factors have left me questioning where I stand in the nursing/medicine world, how I am perceived and how I want to be perceived. I am basically having a huge identity crisis. 

Nursing is my passion. I live and breathe it. I have been a caregiver since I was 16 years old and I am 24 now. But just because I love my career doesnt mean that I do not have different components to my personality. It doesnt mean that I fit society's code of ethics when it comes to medicine. It doesnt mean that I am not an addict, or that I was somehow immune to becoming one. My addiction was never about my job. My addiction to opiates started when I was 19 as a result of an abusive relationship I had with someone. He tricked me into using heroin the first time and told me it was an oxy during a panic attack I had because he stole my credit card and drained it to buy dope. I was roped into riding along during the hustle while I was with my ex in an attempt to protect my car from being stolen by him. But Ive never stolen, hurt, lied, cheated, or otherwise done anything shadey to anyone in pursuit of my own drugs. My biggest fear is that someone will learn about my addiction and try to sabotage my career, or just simply be unable/unwilling to trust me. When I was in nursing school passing narcs. and even now during my shifts at work I do not have any desire to take my patients narcs - no matter how sick I was, I would never do that. When I withdrew recently, I suffered 3 12's in a row - but it was the only thing that kept me sane. It was the only thing that made me feel like I deserved to be clean and happy. I dont always like my patients and coworkers or agree with their behaviors, but I bring my heart to work and I do what I do from a place of love and respect. Out of love and respect for my patients and the nurses around me, I simply would never do that because it is unfair to the patient and could fall back on the nurse. I know how hard it is to get your nursing license, so I would never put someone elses in jeopardy.

All of this being said, my issue deep down in my heart is that I just want to speak. I want to talk about my addiction. I want to talk about my toxic relationships. I want to talk about the duality I live with every day being someone who has an addiction and still loves their job. I want people to be able to hear it from my perspective. I want to be there to validate other addicts and medical staff in their own struggle. I want to be a voice, because there are so many of us who have to dip our heads in shame and hide who we are from the world we immerse ourselves in for 12-16 hours a day, where political correctness is the most important factor. I want to tell my story so badly. I want to make Youtube videos. I want to have a storytime channel. I want other people to feel less alone, and feel brave when they face this.

But most importantly, I want to be allowed to be myself. I want to keep my career and continue helping people and doing what I love. while also being trannsparent and honest and forthcoming about what I have been through. I am terrified someone will recognize me. or dox me, or my employer will see or the board of nursing will see. I would never condone drug use on my channel. but I want to talk about the crazy shit I have seen and done and I dont want to have to withold information or bits of my story just because I might get fired.

What do you guys think? Would you guys like to hear from someone like me? Do you think I would be valuable to helping someone else succeed, or at least feel less alone? Does our community need someone like me?

I have gotten judgmental responses from the medical community on reddit. I received the response I feared and expected.

He is the only staff member that cares about the homeless, dealer, transient, addict  etc. population that hangs out in front of the building and spills into the parking lot and around the street corner everyday. 

When you go inside the entrance, it's a large parking lot with all the rooms' entries on the outside. The manager shows up around noon everyday and then checks rooms/yells at crackheads to get off the property or pay the fee Itbsy I'll discuss later, as well as people who need to pay for another day or pack up their shit. He then leaves around  6pm when everyone around the corner returns and the party reconvenes for drug sales johns/tricks, and the occasional undercover/CI that no one can figure out. 

This motel charges people a 'visitor fee' of $10 to go back to other people's room/enter the parking lot area. It's literally a fee to go and buy your drugs. All the staff other than the manager don't give a shit,  but he's just a prick. 

Anyone else know of a motel that literally profits off people coming to their property to buy drugs? I couldn't believe it when I got told for the first time that I owed the motel $10 because I went into a room for 5min and was then leaving. Luckily the manager is the only one who really enforces this rule so I always make sure to cop before he shows up. ",1533697633.0

Also any hip hop fans?,"My first few posts here documented my re-introduction to dope and my actual introduction to true cold copping (no CL or whisper ever again). Well, first try doing it it was in and out (posted about it already). Second time was worse. Homeless guy saw that I was looking for someone, offered to bring me to the block he goes to, then when I was counting my money he grabbed it and took off. Another homeless guy (bless his soul) saw what happened and hooked me up out of what he had copped earlier that day. What a great dude! Then the next two fuckin times I was still so clueless to the proccess that I drove up and down the block I had copped off first like 6 times and obviously seeing a car go up and down that frequently, people werent approaching me.

So tonight I reconsidered and approached it differently. I parked my car first and hopped out. Yet another homeless guy passes and tries to sell me a needle, I tell him I dont shoot but if he can take me somewhere to cop Ill toss him some cash. Well this man was awesome as well, even asked me how heavy I wanted the Fentanyl in the bags lol. He was like the floor saleseman of this dope neighborhood. He's a super nice guy, so were talkin and he just says ""Ill show you what to do."" One cigarette-length later and Im leaving a satisfied customer. I know this is my third post about my struggles here but Im hiding my use, so I gotta get it out to someone or ill go fuckin crazy lol.

Anyway now Im nodding away (my dude was right, this feels like DOPE; not like Ive felt in a looooong time), and I wanna take some advice from my fellow tiny-pupil-motherfuckers! What kinda tunes do you listen to while getting high? The stranger the better; Ive recently been heavily into classic and modern underground hip hop, but I listen to absolutely EVERYTHING (except no country tbh).

Whistleblowers and politicians stopped that. 

The problem is that manufactures like Purdue Pharma, Insys, Endo, etc marketed their drugs as being less addicting, but that is leading to their demise. 

If those companies never marketed their products like that to doctors, the ""epidemic"" would most likely be happening to a lesser degree.

I think opioids should be provided to addicts in desperate need. I actually believe the US should provide prescription heroin like Germany and Canada.

I also don't like the fact that pain management centers group people with chronic pain with opiate addicts. It's not fair to us, and it has to stop.

Ethically speaking, chronic pain should be treated like any other disease. I remember the 5th Vital Sign...now that worked, but as with any other thing that works, they took it away.

So I've been prescribed bupe patches for pain management, and have been chewing them because... well... you know how it is. Right now I'm probably at a 3-4 mg / day bupe habit that's been going on and off for a few months, and I kind of want off the ride since it's getting stressful.

I have access to clonidine, and I hear that that really helps. I'll probably also have access to 10 g of tramadol to taper, too, and I have a whack ton of Xanax and will probably also have Ambien.

Anyone have any advice regarding the clonidine, and how unpleasant this will be? I tried a few weeks ago to get off by tapering to 400 - 600 mg / tramadol per day and I was rather sick... felt like garbage.

I was originally given morphine and over the years have probably tried everything. 

In 2001 i was switched to Oxycontin 80mg twice a day. By 2003 i was taking a 160mg Oxycontin along with 3 60mg oxy.

Fast forward to 2014, i was switched to 1 OP 80mg and 5 30mg oxycodone k9 pills.
This was probably one of the better reactions my body has had, the k9 was great for breakthru pain and worked almost immediatley.

Now here is where things start to get bad. In 2015 i was t-boned in my car at an intersection on a snowy day. The injuries werent too bad but made my hip and back pain so bad it caused convulsions, no sleep, lost mobility ect.

I was pushed up to and today am currently perscribed 2 OP 80mg OR 2 opana 30mg (my doctor has given both so i choose depending on the day), 8 30mg oxycodone K9 and a few other random meds for blood muscles ect.

My problem is when i went to the doctor this morning he was telling me that because of the new pressure from dea that they are looking to cut my scripts down, he said next month they only want to give me 1 opana 30mg and 2 oxycodone k9.. thats it! Then the month after he mentioned something like 1 opana 20mg and 1 oxy k9.

In almost 30yrs this would be the lowest dose and im in more pain - HOW?

Im terrified of what is to come, what do i do? If i go to another doctor will i have better luck? I have enough going on in my life i really dont need added stress and concern with damn drugs but honestly i am so scared. What if i cant walk or i hurt so much i dont get out of bed? How could he do this to me? When i expressed my concern he said it wouldnt be too bad but i have to tell you something.. my friend killed herself earlier this year at 70 years old! Because she was cut off her dilaudid and could not actually preform functions she was in so much pain -  im scared! 
Please advise me what is it you do in this situation? Can i simply buy them somewhere? Im just looking to not hurt and my docs have done a great job for 30 years and im able to live, but im terrified of whats to come.

Thank you all for reading, im sorry to throw my problem at you but i just hope for some advice or what have you done in this situation.",1533667591.0

When I was maybe 10 I became aware that I had asthma. Asthma never goes away. I used medication for it when I was young but eventually stopped needing it.

Fast forward to dope. For the first 7 months, I could IV without any noticeable impact. I was blowing through every penny and loving it. But After a while of this I began to notice problems.

For one: I developed a severe hacking, productive cough that would never go away. I would wake up, hack my lungs out, spit up brown and red sputum and be off to go score my hit. My parents became concerned. They knew something was wrong when I had had a non stop cough since thanksgiving. I shrugged their concerns off.

I kept using. My problems became worse. I could no longer perform simple cardiovascular exercise. Pretending to shadowbox mid air for the effect of telling a joke put me into a world ending state of breathlessness and hyperventilation in which I had to posture myself with my hands on my knees bending over, staring at the floor with a blank expression while my friends looked at me with worry and confusion as they tried to figure out what the fuck was going on.

I would carry a backpack from my car to my parent's house and have to lay down on my side and focus on not dying. 

It got to the point where one day I simply could. Not. Breathe. My breaths drew in about 10% of my max lung capacity. I was so tight and had so much phlegm I truly thought I was at the end of my life. My mom begged me to go to the hospital and I finally agreed. The doctor takes one look at me and tells me my asthma is totally out of control. He wants to know why it has suddenly become so bad. Asthma? What? I have no problems with asthma. This has to do with dope. Can't tell him anything about my dope problem. It's not asthma doc.

Luckily for me, he didn't listen to me at all and gave me a nebulizer treatment right there and a steroid shot in my ass. Boom. I can breathe again. Holy shit, he might have been right, maybe this is asthma. He prescribes me a nebulizer treatment with albuterol/ipratropium bromide ampules and a fast acting inhaler. For a month or so, I can destroy my body with heroin and then recover at home with my nebulizer, inhaled steroids, oral steroids and a fast acting inhaler. I'm still addicted. Heroin is destroying my body and I don't care. I'm using, becoming bedridden on the verge of death, drowning in my own lungs, huffing nebulized albuterol and loading up shot after shot. I'm taking off days of work. I'm out of sick days. My boss is wondering what the fuck is wrong with me.

It has now gotten to the point where I cannot use any amount of dope without nearly dying. I took two small shots friday night and completely wrecked myself. Bedridden for friday night, saturday, sunday, and monday. I ate a piece of pizza, one bottle of sweet tea and a fourth of a jimmy john's sandwich in those four days. I could not even get up to get myself water or do laundry. I could not even breathe laying down in bed. My garbage can has about 14 empty albuterol ampules in it. I am still hopelessly addicted to dope. I have 5 suboxone in my personal stash.

My life is a dizzying carousel of suffering and recovery and I want to get off. Dope is not even remotely fun anymore but after a year of IV'ing I'm too addicted to quit on my own. I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do. I don't want to die but at 25, it looks like that is what is happening. What do I even do?",1533663202.0

Heroin to ween off methadone.,"I’ve been hooked on methadone since 2015, before that heroin and before that Vicodin. I’m very experienced when it comes to drugs although I will admit I have blind spots in certain areas as I am only human. 

Methadone has improved my life in several ways. That being said it is by far the most addictive and hard to get off of than any other opiate or drug I’ve ever done. In my opinion- getting off heroin was easier. 

The withdrawals are also horrible and make my joints and bones hurt. Especially where I fractured my back. 

I read about diamorphine maintenance that they do in Europe and I got to thinking. Maybe I should just quit methadone and get a eightball if good raw heroin off the onion farm. 

Whenever I feel sick just do a bump. 

If I don’t get carried away- use it safely, have narcan on hand, don’t use needles, do little bumps, buy tested fent free dope, and only do it to get by- maybe it’s the better way to go. I would save lots of time and money (80 mile round trip every morning and 80$ a week) and that’s before I do my 50 mile round trip in the afternoon for work. 

At least this way there will be euphoria and I will get my mornings with my gf back:)

Hey guys I was hoping someone can give me 5 mins of their time and type up a quick guide for someone looking to administer IV heroin themselfs for the first time.

I have experienced the needle before and wasn't too impressed, this time I'd like to try it myself with my own dosages and own gear (pure, from online).

One time I tried this I was super nervous and couldn't hold the rig straight (the gauge was also too big I found out) and I also blew like an inch of air into my arm and it puffed up and i freaked the fuck out so I put the gear up my bum instead.

I am not worried about OD however do you think that someone who can tolerate 800mcg of fentanyl nasal spray \*\*(ROUGHLY THE SAME AS 200MG OXY BUT MORE SEDATING) \*\* could handle half a point of 'pure' (they say it is pure but apparently some smart people did lab tests for the community and its like 73% or something which I believe is still fairly impressive).

Anyways  This time I am a little bit more prepared and watched it administered by others but I have a few questions:  


\- If i am using pure china white that dissolves in liquid without leaving a trace, I don't need to do the whole cooking on the spoon thing like Americans right ? (I am Australian, gear is pure SEA china white bought from very reputable Dmarket seller)

\- Do I have to tie a belt around my arm and make the veins pop out? I see other people just eyeball a vein and go for it, since I am only 70kg, dont ever IV (fresh veins everywhere), can I just pick a vein and go ham?

I will likely go back on, but won't be on such a high dose, as I cannot deal with this chronic pain, but it'd be nice if a small amount of oxy took the pain away like the good ole days.

I used the 5 day bupe WD help program. Which made life so much more easily, and the short term nature means there's no bupe withdrawal.

The literature say it should be done like this.

* **Day 1** - 4 mg at onset of withdrawal, & additional 2 to 4 mg evening dose prn || 4 - 8 mg/day
* **Day 2** - 4 mg mane, with additional 2 to 4 mg evening dose || 4 - 8 mg/day  
* ** Day 3** - 4 mg mane, with additional 2 mg evening dose prn || 4 - 6 mg/day  
* **Day 4** - 2 mg mane prn; 2 mg evening prn  ||  0 - 4 mg/day
* **Day 5** - 2 mg prn 0 to 2 mg  
* **Day 6** - no dose 
* **Day 7** - no dose  
Total proposed dose 12 to 28 mg

My first day I did about 3mg. And then the second day one dose of 2mg. 3rd 1mg, 4th 1mg and today 5th 0mg.  I felt a bit of the withdrawal but figured that would be a good idea, as it might help me recover faster, and no that it's working.

So, this happened a year or so ago and I'm hoping someone can explain to me what the deal is.

Back before I had a script, I used to buy Oxy on the DN. Around 28x40mg OC every month. So I had a moderate tolerance.

One day I thought fuck it and out of complete curiosity, I bought 0.5g of the highest quality #3 I could find. I tested it and it came back good. I also had a great profile (5/5 feedback).

The vendor I bought from came recommend and would only deal on recommendations. Anyway, I know it was high quality.

So, the day arrived. I rather excitedly got my post, unwrapped the .5g (it came in foil ready to smoke) and got prepared. My tolerance around then was 40mg Oxy for a buzz, 80mg to nod.

I put about 100mg on the foil and chased it around. It bubbled away and ran red on the foil. 

Here comes the issue/saving grace depending on your view. I felt absolutely nothing at all. No high. No tingle. Nothing.

So, I tried again. Still nothing. If it matters, the .5 cost me £30 (~$50)

I know I smoked it right. I know I held it in right. 

Since then, I have just stuck with my Oxy. As I get a decent script ever month, I haven't bothered trying it again.

I'm still very curious. Can anyone shed any light on this?

EDIT: having been on Vivitrol for awhile I've been using from day 28 since my last shot through day 32, so 5 days actually. However I've felt next to nothing for the 5 days, meaning most of my receptors are still blocked with more than lingering amounts of Vivitrol apparently. Not sure if that would play a role in the physical dependency or not because withdrawal occurs as the remaining opiates in your body are leaving the receptors so it sounds like that might factor in.",1533614389.0

Today I went to a neurologist, talked with him, and for the first time he doesnt judge me, and he knew a lot bout opiates. I told of my huge habit 500mg/day of morphine IV, told that I wanted a bupe/methadone taper, and finally got it.

But I got a few questions, he didnt know about precipitated wds, for example. He prescribed my a 20mg patch, without naloxone, just bupe (transdermal system, only avaiable here, we dont have in pills form). The patch is supposed to least a week, with peak in 3 days. 

His plan is to taper me on bupe, then put me on fentanyl patches (we have fentanyl transdermal patches) that patch should least 3 days, and then methadone, and then off, I didnt understand that, it should be from methadone to bupe, right? and the fentanyl too wtf

I took 80mg today of methadone (where I get my morph, when the pharm doesnt have morph, I buy dones), and tomorrow I will pick up my morphine (already paid before that), so I dont gonna go to bupe before I end this 60 pills of 30mg morph. 

I was thinking in staying in morph for 7 days, got methadone off my system, and then wait 24h after my last morphine dose. I think its gonna be a little smoother, can someone give me an advice?

He looked different as he had in the past. We made contact and the way those eyes penetrated my soul, it made my heart skipped a beat, which made it beat faster. My forehead heated up, remembering the passion flowing through me, while flirting with him. 
I remembered the hold he had on me, the one where I would run away screaming, only to come back when I thought I couldn’t live without him. 
I decided to walk up to my old lover to see if he recognized how far I have gotten, without him in my life.
I remembered why I loved him so much, while he touched my lips and was so gentle. I felt my face blush, yet didn’t want him to stop. My breath drew quickly, from his touch. 
So many thoughts running through my head as he kissed me, so passionately. I immediately wondered if I could go all the way and not get sucked in, as I did before. I wondered if I could let go, once the passion turned toxic. I thought of the previous time, the hurt and pain it caused. Getting over it I thought I was going to die, to wake up and feel like I haven’t sleep, eyes constantly tearing up, thoughts of suicide and a depressive state occupied my head for months. I grappled with what to do, as I slipped back into familiar territory. I knew I would allow that lust to come back into my life again ...
And again ...
I kiss back, praying inside and telling myself I can handle it this time. It was more of an attempt of convincing myself that I would not let the love overpower me once again. Yet I fell, I allowed myself to fall in love/lust once again. 

When will I abandon this love I have?  I can drop a destructive boyfriend in a minute but this destructive love I can’t let go of.

.. Im currently taking 3 to 4 Percocet 10s a day.. 150 lbs, 27 yr old female, been using the tabs/percs for 3 years-ish daily and 2 years before i got back on the tabs/percs, i kicked my 1.5 year opana addiction on my own, only to end up working opiates back into my life slowly but surley a couple years later. So you can say on and off for 7 or 8 years.. 

 For a year I have been doing weekly mental health therapy sessions to help with my c-ptsd, anxiety, depression and panic attacks- basically trying to treat my mental health issues and develop new coping mechanisms to make my risk of relapse lower.. I feel like i finally have faith in myself in getting sober and i feel like i am in a much better place mentally than i have ever been. Also have been doing physical therapy to help with my pain so i dont have as big of an excuse to reach for pain pills/to rationalize my usage. 

Now, i have been weening down to only 5mg at a time some times and trying to stretch my dose out to every 5 or 6 hours instead of taking 10mg every 4 hours. Its kind of torture as im very moody and that weird tingle feeling of my bones jumping out of my skin is the worst.. But none the less im trying to make it easier for when my quit day comes.. Which im hoping will be in 2 weeks.

Here is my actual question:
I know you likely arent doctors but in your experience and opinion, is detoxing alone safe for someone of my dosage? Im kind of wanting to rent a cheap cabin in the woods for 5 or 6 days and just bite the bullet- away from my bf who i dont want to lash out at due to my pain and anger and anxiety that rushes to the surface, away from everyone and everything that could be a trigger. I have valium to use to ease the withdrawl and im not wanting to use suboxone. I am not the kind of addict that goes balls to the walls with any old substance- i dont like anxiety meds enough for the valium to be a problem and will take them safely- opaites is my weakness, not anxiety meds and i know how to ration and control myself with those valiums so i dont think that part will be an issue. 

Have any of you detoxed off this amount? Did you do it alone? What do you think about this plan? I Just want to make sure im not going to have some physical reaction that could cause me to die or something.. I have heard opaite withdrawal cannot kill you unlike alcohol withdrawal. Any insight would be appreciated.

The cops wanted to rip the house apart and charge them all with so many things. Assault (of which I have video of the threats of violence and the assault itself), drug charges out the ass (of which I have voice recordings of them admitting to stealing my medications), international drug trafficking since they brought pills back from Europe 4 times and admitted on audio recording, the list goes on.

Considering the fact that I was in there for needles, usually the situation is awkward. Walmart is always awkward and I did try an exchange one time before but it was closed for the day and the guy working there made it super awkward. 

It’s nice to know that there are people out there who truly care about the safety and well being of EVERYONE and not just clean, law-abiding citizens.

Especially if it's uneventful and doesn't warrant added attention to detail. Some have expressed disappointment, a smaller subset of which I suspect are not pulling my leg when they say ""this post sucks, it's not ams good as when something bad happens to you."" Of course I'm paraphrasing and I don't think anyone genuinely wants harm to come my way. They just want me to experience enough shenanigans to make the store worth reading. I get it. 


&nbsp;

Yesterday I agreed to drop by his house to have some birthday cake and to catch up for twenty minutes. He said ""even if you go out, drop in on your way back for cake for like twenty minutes."" While riding my bike home from work I was abit hungry and reluctant to go to Cliffs -- I had cold feet. He called once and I cursed my phone a few times, I scream ""fucking shit"" or something with the ""F"" word and when I neared a pedestrian I turned my head and said ""pardon me."" Well, there goes my hope that he'd pass out and forget that I'd be getting off work. I decided to pull over and think.

&nbsp;
 
Right off the bat I knew that his house would likely smell bad, maybe worse and maybe worse because of my senses being mal-adapted. So I decided to eat my cold slice of pizza outside on the service road as I read responses to my last post on Reddit. This was the only way I could enjoy this pizza aside from going home first. After the pizza biked to a deli then called Cliff back to announce the fact that I shall be arriving shortly. The plan was to secure my bike outside and then to leave my backpack on the hood of the car in the driveway - there was no way or reason for me to bring that backpack inside the house. One less item that in need of thorough decontamination. Still treated it as though it was contaminated since I did put the backpack on my back when I left.

&nbsp;


#Upon opening the door

A fruitfly entered my mouth, I spat it out and sputtered my lips lightly to ensure nothing else gained entry. Right after that I noticed the smell, a sense that is linked to memory and remembered other times I'd enter at the start of a wait which I no longer engage in. We greeted one another and shook hands, it was a little sticky and presumably sweaty. The cake was just taken out, an icing cake as opposed to ice cream cake. I chose the plastic chair since it carried a lower risk of bed bug infestation. 


&nbsp;

A cake, a cola and a paper towel for a napki, the lst of which rapidly became forfeit when I saw a family of fruit flies crawling along it's textured surface. Hell, one fly ended up on the icing of my cake - I blew on it really hard until it left because it wouldn't leave when I tried flicking it with my spoon. What am I to do? Fuck it, it's just a fruit fly as opposed to a full grown house fly. 



**Fact:** A fly's mouth is like an elephant trunk, except that it squirts vomit in order to externally digest food enabling the fly to slurp it up! So, when a fly lands on your food, it stands to be reasoned that it's going to at least drool a little bit of vomit.


&nbsp;


So anyway, of course he was curious and seemed genuinely interested in what I was up to, what my potential job opportunity was and so forth. He called out to his mom, ""that's right near where you used to work."" I forgot some details but after eating the cake he asked if I'd stick aroudn another 15-20 minutes to check movie times. Sure I could do 10-25-20 minutes but I must be up early tomorrow I said in order to set expectations. We ultimately conclude that Wednesday or Thursday is the best day to see the movie and we  briefly discuss candy. Things like when and where to get the candy... he says ""maybe we'll make a stop on the way"", which I pointed out is not ideal with a cab or Uber.

&nbsp;


Basically I said I'd be happy to get the candy before the movie so we don't have to make a stop. He gets paid that day and says he's buying the tickets so I'd be neither suprised or annoyed if I'm expected to get the candy as it's quite fair. Cliff did mention that he'd probably get a soda at the thetre because a 20 ounce soda won't last too long. That's fine, though now I think about it, he could just buy a liter. It's not like his baggy shorts couldn't accomodate it.


Oh speaking of shorts. He had to pull up his pants for lack of a belt before we sat down, but I noticed that this pair of shorts were more ripped than his boxers which havve appeared in the past to only consist of the elastic waist band and a layer of cloth on one side but not both and not contiguously. 

&nbsp;


Well anyway, I'm not here to shit on his fashion - just mentioning because I'm damn near certain he's not going to wear these shorts to the movie but if he did the weight of a soda would pull them down and it would be very unwieldy.

I mean like, I shouldn't speak too ill in this particular post because he's offering to do something nice - to buy me a movie ticket. To do a wholesome activity that friends do which does not neccesitate consumption of drugs.


&nbsp;

Speaking of drugs, he offered me an oxy pill (to be crushed into a line) three times ""for old times sake."" Each time I declined, first time I was clear that I don't pass judgement on people's choices in terms of partying in this manner but that I've come so far and that I do not want to reset my counter now. He acknowledged in an understanding manner and continued along. As we spoke about his pay day coming up he also casually inquired if I was getting paid this Thursday. I casually said, maybe... but I mean like obviosuly yes. I know when I get paid and Cliff knows I wouldn't not know. 


nbsp;


I didn't ask him why he cared when I was getting paid but I did state ""yeah, I'll have no trouble getting candy."" I didn't snap as I would have back when  I was in the game. I used to snap and say ""I'm not spending my whole paycheck on dope!"" Like to head-off expecations that used to exist. From the bygone era when I only bought dope through Cliff and if it was my pay day and not his was loaning out dope thereby doubling my cost while cutting my own enjoyment in half.


In this case, I can't quite read between the lines. It's not as simple as mid November when he mentioned plans of buying a brick of dope so that neither of us would be sick through the holiday. Of course the implication was that I'd be chipping in on that brick, which in itself isn't unfair but I was not letting him butter me up to that idea at the time because I knew that if it turned out he didn't get paid on time that I'd be the one buying the brick until he could pay me back for his share of it. At the time I said ""I'm not spending all my money on a brick."" To which he'd respond, ""I'm not saying that you are.""


Point is, many times it became possible to read between the lines in order to identify Cliff's unstated intentions.



Like I said, in this case I must be rusty because I can't seem to figure out what he may be plotting, if anything at all. He may yet still just genuinely want to see this movie and nothing else but I can't help but expect a ""gotcha"" or ""one other thing."" Maybe it was a genuine inquiry just to ensure that I would be able to buy candy while he buys the movie tickets - as opposed to me being down to my last $20 saying last minute on movie night ""I can't get candy because I paid for the Uber.""


&nbsp;


He wasn't particularly insistent about doing a 15mg linme of oxy ""for old times sake"", aside from offering it three times over the course of thirty minutes but I wouldn't be surprised if on movie night he offered again. I can resist it no matter wahat but I hope for his sake he isn't overly insistent on it. That will reduce the liklihood of me hanging with him in the future. Even so, I can't spend long chunks of time in his house. The bugs and the smell. My shirt smelled like a combination of mold-food when I got home and took it off. The sweat and humidity makes it way worse than in winter.

&nbps;

In conclusion, I don't have time to edit this post because I have to be ready for something important in less than one hour. I had every intention of keeping this post short since there was no action or anything bad that happened to me. I bet if I typed this on my smartphone it would've been way shorter.

The complexity of the corruption and the vast amounts of energy expended at the express purpose of forcing others to suffer disgusts me, and it has ever since I was old enough to understand what was really going on around me. At the same time I am overly empathetic and tend to genuinely care about the well-being of others,  friends, family and strangers, so my anger does not get expressed through the disrespect or mistreatment of other individuals. Instead of taking out my anger on other people I take it out on myself. Over time, the inner rage develops into a hatred manifesting itself as my own thorough type of self-destruction. It is one of my basic needs to relieve myself of the anger, rage and confusion justified ironically by the continued injustices experienced by my generation while trying to survive in modern American society. Which is why the worst decisions I make always feel the best. As much as I try to tell myself, as much as I try to believe that I can be happy, successful and healthy, I will ultimately restrict myself from achieving any goals that are purported to be “positive.”  I think now that I can be actually happy by excepting this recent realization as a self diagnosis and running with it. Thus, actually relieve myself of much of the guilt that I create just as a byproduct of convincing myself that my decisions are “bad.”  It’s time for me to truly disconnect from the ideas, judgments and opinions of society at large. I’m not the one suffering from some type of mental illness I’m just one of the few sane individuals wandering around this insane society.

It was dark black tar with a pungent aroma. He only worked from 11 in the morning till 8 at night. We’d call the number, which was really to one of his buddies sitting in a house and tell his buddy where we were. That guy would use a walkie talkie or boost mobile to tell Victor. They always said, “Twenny meenus. Twenny meenus,” but it was never twenty minutes. It usually took him a whole hour or two of neighborhood residents and store managers eyeing us as we waited and looked suspicious sitting on a random street corner curb.

I did half gram shots of it. That was a good dose for me. The stuff that I’d gotten from Fin and Jimbo, though, was way better than Victor’s stuff. Fin told me to be careful, so I was. I poured three match heads worth into that little aluminum cooker and didn’t even have to cook it. It turned the water translucent brown with a swirl of the black rubber plunger.

I always say that the rush, for me anyway, is like an elephant stepping my chest or back. I have always attributed it to the constriction of bronchiole tubes and veins that made it feel like that, and as I sat on that orange bucket next to a dirty mop and some piping running through 2x4 studs, I thought it might be too much. It scared me. Getting up and getting to where Fin and Jimbo could see me would be the best bet as far as being where someone could watch me and call the ambulance, but it wasn’t that serious. Sublime slumber. The nod lasted until late afternoon and the day glowed blue in the streets and warm yellow lights turned on through the windows in the city.

I stood up satisfied with what I’d gotten from that last hit. Jimbo handed me a cup of coffee in a Styrofoam cup. It was cold. I spit it out. Fin was watching TV and smoking another joint. The fat dalmatians still laying at his feet.

“What’d you do that for?” He asked.

“It’s cold.”

“Yeah? So?”

“I don’t want it.”

“Don’t want it?”

“No.”

“K.” He took the cup and put it to his lips. He drank. I grimaced.

“You like that?”

“Sure. I like it.”

“Whatever. So, the stuff’s really good.”

“Don’t mess with it myself, but you know that. I’ve heard it’s the best.”

“I’d say so. What does the Faceless One want with Bug’s eye, anyway?”

The Faceless One had been a pimp and dealer in the 80s when crack was first hitting the streets in a big way. They called him Joseph Junior back then. He’d gotten to be notorious and feared, but one of the girls who worked for him got killed by a John while she was working.

As if having your daughter working in the sex trade and turned out for dope isn’t bad enough, her father lost his mind when she got murdered. He found Joseph Junior and pretended to be a customer, but when he got close enough, he opened a bottle of sulfuric acid and threw it in his face. Supposedly, the skin on his face had been completely melted to the skin on his shoulders and chest. Teeth stuck out. It was hard to tell where his jaw had been. His eyes had turned into milky blue orbs. He was blind. Reconstructive surgery only did so much according to Jimbo, who acted as a liaison between street thugs like me and the Faceless One. He’d seen him once. The rest of their correspondence was through the first girl to ever work for the Faceless One, now a middle aged Russian woman named Natalia. I wasn’t supposed to know that. Jimbo always told me more than he should have.

Since then, his power had only grown. Legend on the streets had it that he appealed to Satan himself during one of the first surgeries during which the anesthesia almost killed him. Now, his body was inhabited by some evil and ancient entity. He wasn’t Joseph Junior anymore. He hadn’t been for years.

“Listen to me, Boom Boom. What the Boss wants with Bug’s eye is anyone’s guess. I don’t ask. If it were up to me, I’d be out of this whole thing, but now I’m involved. I can’t get out or else you might be coming for my eye next.”

“I’d never.”

“You’d never but you never know what happens when you’re pushed.”

“Yeah. But you know me.”

“I do. You’re good people, so I’m gonna let you know something.”

“Yeah? What’s that?”

“Your friend. You know the one that tells everyone he’s your brother?”

“Rufus?”

“Yeah. Rufus.”

“What about him?”

“Word is he needs to stay away from that woman he’s been talking to.”

“Which one?”

“Jaqueline Onassis over there on the bench by the bay.”

“Ally Alcoholic?” She wore glasses and a bandana on her head at all times and always sat on the same bench. She was pretty too, except for her legs which stuck out of the one-piece bathing suit she always wore. They were plum colored and bent unnaturally like baby doll arms.

“Is that what you guys are calling her now?”

“Her name is Allison McDonald but yeah.”

“Sure. He needs to stay away from her. I know you care about him.”

“And what if he doesn’t?”

“Well you know better than I do what happened to Bug.”

I knew he was talking about some obscure command which had come from the Faceless One to him about Rufus talking to Ally. It didn’t make sense. There was nothing I could do about it though and nothing Jimbo could do either. I hoped Rufus would listen when he got out.

“I do. K. Jimbo, I’m out.” I waved to Fin. “See ya, Fin.”

“Be careful out there.” They said in unison.

Jimbo’s shop was only a few blocks from where we usually slept. After everything I’d just heard about Rufus and the Faceless One from Jimbo and Bug’s eye, I felt empty.  Probably the heaviest thing was that Rufus wasn’t with me. As much as I hated the way he smelled and obnoxious ramblings about nothing, I missed him. The rain fell in soft black whispers on the asphalt. I sat under our overhang on a piece of cardboard.

*A half ounce of the best.* I thought. My package sat inside of my backpack which I had opened at the top and held the stash I’d just gotten. I stroked it like my pet. I pulled the same needle I’d used earlier at Jimbo’s and got ready to fix again for the night.",1533520177.0

**DANGER**: Using large amounts of Imodium and/or using Imodium over a long period of time can cause heart damage and other bodily damage up to **death**. I am not a medical expert and can not recommend using Imodium as a safe withdrawal method. I have used up to 40-50mg of straight Loperamide a day to minimize withdrawal symptoms accepting the possible risks associated with it, but I've never exceeded 60mg and have never taken it consecutively more than 3 days, and then only take it when absolutely necessary (maybe twice a month). 

There have been deaths from users who reportedly were taking 100s of mgs a day repeatedly. I have heard anecdotally of Imodium addicts taking ~100mg a day, and some have reported heart damage. Loperamide addiction is one of the most dangerous drug addictions one can have - it is *known* to be cardiotoxic at those dosages, not telling what other damage is caused since Loperamide addiction is relatively new and thus has not been thoroughly studied. Its withdrawals are also surprisingly horrific and probably very long given how long its half-life is. All for a ""high"" that feels more a flu than a real opioid high. 

******************************************************************************************

Regardless, Loperamide has been a lifesaver for me during withdrawal - not just for withdrawals but for overall symptoms, **especially** RLS. With a ~1g/day IV heroin it, taking 40-50mg/day reduced almost every physical withdrawal symptom. I can even sleep with it, which is a *miracle* while in withdrawal. In fact, that's about all I do while using it during withdrawal, since while it makes withdrawal *bearable* it doesn't make them go away completely. 

Anyway - finally to my point - I've been able to buy straight Loperamide (Imodium) pills (small green pills 2mg each) for ages at just about any Walmart or grocery store in the country, they've recently been starting to crack down on them. Which is just lovely, because now at my local Walmart the only options are some liquid concoction which I've never tried before, and these new capsules that are 2mg Loperamide and 125mg Simethicone. They're a lot bigger than the traditional small green pills too, so it'll definitely be a lot harder to swallow the 15-24 I usually do for a day.

Anyway, how safe is Simethicone? It worries me a bit that they've added it to their formula. Looking it up it appears to be an anti-gas agent. If I take 15-24 pills then that is 30-48mg of Loperamide and 1875-3000mg of Simethicone. 

Has anyone had any experience using pills with this before? Will that dosage of Simethicone make me drop dead or otherwise cause organ damage? 

If there's a better sub to post this question then please redirect me. This whole crackdown on Imodium is annoying the shit out of me. Anyone trying to get ""high"" on Imodium is an absolute moron and risking death or permanent heart damage for a super shitty ""high"" that will feel like a fever high. I'm aware that the dosage I take isn't exactly *safe* either so please don't preach to me - I'm actually hoping to take that amount of Imodium for maybe 4-5 days at most, dropping the dosage each day, to hopefully wean off opiates for a final day and (ideally) say sayonara!
