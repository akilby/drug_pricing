I also did get less than 3 hours of sleep last night (don’t know if relevant)

At this point I’m typing just to keep mentally and physically engaged but I also really want any help I can get 

Also MOST IMPORTANTLY is there an amount of time since dosing that people generally agree you’re “in the clear”? I.e. safe to engage the experience, sit down, smoke a cig etc. it’s now been 45 min or so

I've picked up from him twice so far and each time he's been great about timing. He even said he can come all the way to me if I can't come out to him. Another plus is he'll sell 2 points for $15! My old dboy would sell me a minimum of 3 points and that is $30. I wouldn't say his stuff is FIRE but it's definitely above average.

The result is always the same, inevitably I reach a point where I appear to only have two choices, either dose and end the withdrawal or do something crazy. No worries, this isn't one of those posts, I very much don't want to do something stupid like that but I can easily see that could happen if I was in withdrawal again and didn't have anything to make me well. I've been dosing a couple of times a day for the last year, just enough to keep me well but ultimately it's only a matter of time before my inventory is exhausted and then I will be in withdrawal with nothing to dose.

It seems the easy answer before that inevitably happens is the ultra rapid detox where you are in an intensive care unit, put into a medically induced coma and then on a naloxone drip for 6 or 8 hours. One popular protocol seems to be the [Waismann Method®]( http://www.opiates.com) but I've compiled a list of clinics all over the world that offer something similar. Surely someone here must have gone though that as they claim to have treated thousands of patients?  I'd really like to hear from someone that has gone though this acceleration of two weeks of torture into a matter of hours. How did you feel after you woke up? How long before you were back to normal or at least well enough to travel? ",1533240649.0

I remember it vividly. I was 19. I was with my bf (at the time) in a Walgreens parking lot. He was in the driver's seat, doing his best not to look at me. I was a sweaty mess puking out the passenger door while crying hysterically. 

We had run out of OxyContin the day before and we were both sick as fuck. It was not the first time I had experienced withdrawal; in fact this was probably like a full year into our addiction. But for some reason the gravity of our situation hit me like a fucking truck. The money we were spending, the lies to our families, the items we had stolen and pawned, the fucking eviction notice we got earlier that day. 

""We're fucking junkies!"" I wailed. ""This isn't supposed to be my life!"" ""What are we going to do???"" I was inconsolable.

""Get a fucking grip"" he hissed at me. He was disgusted with me, how weak I was.  Fuck I was too. 

I sucked in air through gritted teeth until my lungs felt like they were going to explode. ""FUCK YOU"" I screamed. Customers in the parking lot all turned to look in unison. I didn't fucking care. I was absolutely destroyed in that moment. I knew I had one choice. Kill him and then myself. I could see no other way out. 

And then my phone vibrated

'All good com thru' Damion, my dealer, texted. 

I collapsed against my seat in utter relief. I wiped my face, slammed my door shut and said "" let's go, he's good"". ",1533194777.0

And when they test it they test the metabolites to see exactly what you’ve been taking. 
      Well around July my number came up... usually have a spare bottle of piss on me, but today wasn’t a good day and I was already out to begin with, had been for like a day and a half. My last shot was an opana 40 and snorted maybe 10 more mg at lunch that day, and that was almost exactly 36 hours ago. Long story short I was fucked. So I go in drinking a shit load of water knowing it damn well wasn’t going to help either but hey what the hell. So I pissed in a cup and went back to work. They usually take about a week or two for the results to come back.
     Well a week goes by and I get the phone call I’d been waiting on from medical telling me that I’d failed. They asked if I had been taking any other medications. And low and behold I’d had sinus surgery at the beginning of the year. Script for perc 7.5s. So I told them that I had taken some of those from getting hit in the face playing basketball.
    Ok well we’re going to get our information together and we’ll call you back. So I scheduled vacation for the week after next. Since I travel. Didn’t wanna go all the way to BFE just to get fired and come back home... so I went to researching things... turns out, oxycodone can metabolize into oxymorphone. Got a call back from doctor lady saying everything was good and that with the information I had provided my test was negative. She was still concerned though..
      Since I she had looked into my medical history, she found out that I’d been to rehab in the past. So she has currently put me out of work pending I talk and get evaluated by a counselor. So I called the boss and he said my week of vacation wouldn’t go through either.. so I’ve even still got that... only bad news is I’ll be off work for 2-3 weeks pending the evaluation... which will probably also come with another drug test. But hey, I still got a Fucking Job!! Woo!!!

93wugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93wugd/did_i_really_die/,6,https://redd.it/93wugd,sadstateofaffair,Did I really die?,"Edit- this is actually happened and the details are based on what I can recall (changed my name), and I honestly want your opinion.......

I woke up in an ambulance to beeping sounds, EMT chatter, and the inescapable feeling that my lungs were super glued together. I literally could not breathe. I finally managed to separate my lungs and got a bit of air, but they clamped right back down, after I managed to let out a whimpering “HELP!”

“Get him something in case he throws up.... Raoul, how much did you take?”

I draw another breath, lifting what literally felt like 1,000lbs on my chest, and sucked in a wisp of air.

“NOTH-ING,” I managed to sputter as absolute panic set in. I thought I was dying, suffocating, best case scenario in an ambulance- yet still... deny, deny, deny. Some instincts....

“Raoul, you overdosed. We can still see the white powder in your nose.”

“I *wheeze* DIDNT *wheeze* NOTHING.” It was still impossibly difficult to breathe, and I couldn’t see.

“Raoul, you weren’t breathing. Your face was blue. We need to know what you took and how much you took.”

I couldn’t see. My arms and legs were numb, but I could tell they were strapped down as I began to regain feeling in my fingers and toes. Breathing started to become slightly easier, however it was still an involuntary task- i had to force myself to breath. It started to dawn on me- I had finally done it.  I had finally OD’d. I was in an ambulance and would shortly be in a jail hospital.

“XANAX,” I wheezed in a panic. I had a prescription for Xanax, and my oxygen starved brain thought I could trick them into thinking that was all I had taken.

Fact was, according to the last thing I remember, the three of us were waiting at a bus stop for a 3rd mobile dealer after the first two fell through (imagine that). I was a ball of anxiety drenched in sweat on a chilly fall day, and my pupils were so dilated you could see into my soul if it weren’t for the dopesick tears flowing out of my eyes. 

Chances of copping anytime soon were looking grimmer by the second, so I popped the emergency 2mg Xanax bar I always keep on me. I’ve got a prescription(read: tolerance). Didn’t know how long this was going to take, and I needed anything to take the edge off. You know that exact feeling.

I had copped from this dude before with no out of the ordinary issues, but he was the paranoid type- something was always off with him. I chalked it up to the the fact that I was the only white person for miles on the southside of a very large city known prominently for drugs and violence. I stood out. Literally everyone knew why I was there, and literally nobody cared.

After what seemed days, my buddy got the call. He’s an old head, black dude, so they trust him. I’ll throw him a bag to cop for me so I don’t have to get in and out of a car or deal with stone cold killers face to face. Plus he’s got connections- he grew up in that neighborhood. It’s worth it.

Finally- glory! It was here! That feeling when he dropped the bags into my hand- I don’t have to describe the excitement because you know exactly the feeling I speak of. I was feeling generous after the ordeal and we were both sick as snot, so I rolled up a dollar bill popped open a bag of fluffy white powder and split it with him while we walked. 

Sweet relief.

We went our separate ways and I busted out another bag as I was walking towards the train. I always have a bag on my walk to the train to get me well. I put that up my nose with no problem- in fact it was amazing. One of the best tasting bags ever. You know how the sicker you are, the better it is when you finally do get right? Or how the best high in the world is after giving up hope because the odds of it coming thru are one and a million... and then it *actually* does? Those feelings multiplied by each other with some Xanax sprinkled on top.

I was at the point tolerance wise where i was copping 10 bags at a time, and one was just enough to normalize me. 10 would be gone in a day if I had money. I wasn’t worried about that half bag we split. Or the 2mg of Xanax I had taken. Or the last-resort-shady-dealer who provides the white powder (pretty common in this area).*Why the fuck would I have a single worry at all- I had 10 bags in my hand!!!!!!*

I made quick work of the bag. Bill rolled up, inside bag, inside palm of my hand and walking through city traffic nobody bats an eye. Makes me confident as ever- even cocky. And just as I’m walking around the corner..... I wake up in an ambulance with super glue in my lungs, suffocating........

“RAOUL, can you hear me? Xanax and what else? I NEED to know what you took and HOW MUCH you took.”

My breath was slowing coming back but i could still feel my lungs touching. I had no concept of time. I was literally fighting to breath. The rest of my body was still numb and I couldn’t see.

“I CANT GO BACK TO JAIL,” I muttered.

“You’re not gonna go to jail we just need to know how much you took. We are trying to save your life.”

“I CANT *wheeze* GO BACK TO JAIL!”

Rinse and repeat. I went back and forth with the EMTs like this for the entire ride. I finally regained feeling in my hand and checked my jean pocket- the 9 bags were gone.

They wheeled me into the hospital and my vision was starting to come back. I refused to give them any personal information. I refused treatment. They had a police officer put on gloves and give me a *very* reluctant “pat down.”

I was taken aback at how quick and light the pat down was. 5 seconds long, just a quick pat on the belt loop and shoulders. I was wearing a teeshirt and no belt.... I’ve had tighter security going into concerts. At this point I was starting to realize there MIGHT be a chance I wasn’t going to jail.

I kept asking if I was free to go. They said yes but naturally they didn’t recommend it and used all the words they could to keep me there. I did agree to wait for the doctor to come by. He did, and Doc told me I had stopped breathing, turned blue and had technically died. He told me if I refused to stay there I was going to go back out there and kill myself. 

Doc told me I didn’t know how lucky I was.  I didn’t know how lucky I was, because the thought that went through my head was, oh-so-familiar- *I’m a heroin addict. I’m invincible.* Get me the fuck out of here. That was my thought process- sound familiar? My ungrateful ass had fulfilled my duty to speak with the doctor and decided it was time to haul ass before they changed their mind. So i started to scoot out of the hospital bed.

At that moment I realized why the cop barely searched me (besides the fact they already had my dope). I had full blown shit myself. Like a hot milkshake spread all over my both my asscheeks. I felt it spread as I squished out of the hospital bed. The smell- you can only imagine.  I don’t know if you can imagine. No cop wants to deal with dope fiend OD shit in their cruiser.

One bathroom, one industrial roll of toilet paper, one bottle of hand sanitizer one hour and negative 1 pair of underwear and I was out of there. 

While still on hospital grounds I called my middle man, “Where you at? Yeah im still high. High as fuck. But I just went through some SHIT and I need a few more bags to be on the safe side- I’m not trying to get sick.”

I had no idea if the Narcan was gonna kick in later or if it had run it’s course. All I knew was I had a date that night I couldn’t miss so I couldn’t risk getting sick. I copped 4 more bags from my regular guy and ended up puking every hour for the rest of the night- with my angel of a date who thought I was just regular sick. I thought it was the Narcan at the time, but I’m guessing Narcan didn’t rip the all the fent off my brain so I was still high and Unnecessarily sniffing more powder. Or it could have been my body recovering from (possible) death.

I genuinely don’t know how lucky I was. I don’t feel lucky- I’m still a heroin addict.

End of story.


***Serious question- in your opinion/experiences- do you think I really died or was that a scare tactic they used on me? It’s all pretty hazy besides the details I outlined above which are pretty vivid memories.  I don’t remember falling out. The xanax bar plus he hot bag was what did me in. If I wasn’t in a busy metropolitan city in the midst of an opioid epidemic I’m certain I would be dead. I just don’t know if I actually died. What do you guys think? Stay safe!

Please excuse any format/grammar/spelling issues- i typed this all on mobile and didn’t go back for a proof read. 

Morale of the story- DO NOT MIX BENZOS AND OPIATES and ALWAYS START SMALL TO TEST YOUR BATCH! LIVE BY THIS RULE AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO LIVE!!!! STAY SAFE!!!!!!!

There’s a second person with no opioid use, but regularly takes gabapentanoids like Lyrica, and formerly abused Phenibut. This person takes benzos daily and has been weaning down from n2mg klonopin daily. Did not dose klonopin prior to taking GHB and has had 15 ML with no noticeable effects.

I'd snort oxies (smoking them is a rediculous waste imo even though it does feel great but only lasts 30 minutes as opposed to snorting which lasts about 4 hours) and smoke the h. I did have one friend that says he preferred oxies and hydros to smoking h. BUT he would say that tar is only truly euphoric for him if iv'd and he did prefer that to the other opiates.




Oxies gave me much more euphoria and I loved the energy aspect to it. I started smoking black tar once I couldn't afford 15 Roxie's a day. Smoking the tar literally gave me almost no euphoria. Why is this? I'm the only one I know that preferred oxys. I'd of much rather crushed up 4 or 5 Roxie's to snort than smoke .2-.3 of black. What are your opinions about this?




One more question..  Is China white heroin or fentanyl? Seems to be a lot of confusion on that for me. I did try iv'd China white only once and I honestly wasn't impressed. Maybe the quality was low or it could have been because I was tweaking at the time I tried this, so maybe that took away from it?

But, I dont know how to start. I know you need to be off heroin for 24 hours, but i can't get past 10. The therapist who works for my doctor said the doctor won't let me go through that. She said ""we're not gonna put you through that (withdrawls), that's not what we do. Tell her (doctor) what you told me ( that i was afraid i couldn't make it 24 hours), and she'll help you"".
My question is, what can she do for me? I haven't heard of anything, I thought maybe subutex, but the paperwork says they don't prescribe it in that office so they can't treat pregnant women. I don't think there's anything she can do right? Maybe xanax ? 
So i have just enough heroin to get me to the appointment. Ill be good till around 7 or 8. Should I buy another quarter tonhold me till the weekend so i can go through withdrawls on my day off, or is there a way she can get me started sooner. I use my last dose at 9:30 am, my appointment with her is at 2:30pm, and I work the following morning at 10. What do i do? Had anyone had a problem with not being able to make it to 24 hours? I'm not being a baby, I get serious withdrawals by 9 hours, especially when im tapering, which i have been.",1533182930.0

i just feel the need to share

Im in my mid twenties and have been struggling with polydrug addiction for about 10yrs, i only recently started iv ing dope. I had numerous attempts to quit when i would hit rock bottom-ish situations but always ended up relapseing.

Im just tired of all this shit. It s consuming and soul crushing. Im so fucking angry that i cant just take this affliction just upon myself. The effect it has on people close to me fckin disgusts me. 

For the first time in many years i'll face the real world. I'll face withdrawals and all the negative emotions that come with reality..
But i refuse to be numb the pain. I refuse to be absent from my own life. The loneliness that comes with this lifestyle is killing me...


Im breaking the habbit before it breaks me.. I want to go back to being that outgoing kind hearted likeable kid who i was before all this, but even if thats not possible, i just want to feel alive for a change.

Peace homies, stay safe",1533182694.0

This sounds really bad, but I've been keeping it in check and nobody knows. Only downfall so far is my weight has been going down slightly... how do I maintain muscle?",I know using opiates can reduce testosterone... I went to the gym today and was noticeably weaker than I went last time. However I had not gone since the relapse like 25-30 days ago so that could be why I'm weaker and not due to strictly the heroin.... I have minor track marks but I keep those in check by using good needles and luckily I still have some go-to spots I still am able to hit every time. I just want to know if maintaining muscle mass is possible long-term when using. I still have a good appetite and everything else is fine. My tolerance isn't skyrocketed either.,1533178854.0

Throw away cus people know my username.

I have been using opiates off and on since I was 15 and have just turned 19. I've come to this sub tons of time for advice and learned everything about opiates and more importantly harm reduction from you guys. For a long time you guys were my only people to talk to about this shit. I got started the same way lots of people do, had a surgery and it was just codeine, but I'm the type of person who just wants to get fucked up, but was too scared to get actual drugs I guess. Opiates were my first drug and I loved them instantly. Once I used up my supply I thought that was that but you guys know how it goes. Another surgery, a family member, old pills, all that good stuff. I never used enough to get physically addicted, I typically used for a few weeks in a row just on weekends with month or two long breaks in between. Still, I was psychologically addicted and that's enough. I eventually started to use a bit more, buying pills now, getting high on weekends and it got harder to keep it that way. I began getting depressed on days that I wasn't getting high and quit for a bit, but the depression lasted. I hadn't used that much, I had been taking methadone to get high 2 times a week for 2 months when I was 16, never building up any tolerance but still being an addict in my own way. I was still depressed after a few months and ended up taking oxy after getting my wisdom teeth out. By now only my closest friends knew and only because I told them. This had stayed hidden from my family and anyone I didn't want to know. I was alone, none of them had ever touched anything so while they were kind, they didn't really get it. After another short break I needed more, but all I could find was heroin. So I took the plunge. I bought heroin and started snorting it. It was only half a gram but I had developed little to no tolerance due to how often I took breaks (30mg of Oxy still got me where I wanted to be). I only ever bought it once because I realized what was happening. I was up one night high for the third night in a row when I saw what was going on. I was watching Bojack and >!Sarah Lin died!<. The scene just hit me so hard. I realized that this was my last chance. If I didn't stop right now, this second, shit would end up outside of my control. It was just this moment of clarity and I just knew I had to stop. So I flushed what I had left (about a third of the half gram) and quit right there and then. I was 17 at this point and it was October.

Right after quitting was hard. Really hard. I wanted to give up but I stuck through it. I didn't even have physical withdraws but I still craved it everyday. After a month it seemed like the universe decided I was worthy. I met my girlfriend. She is my first girlfriend and we're still together today. She helped me so much. If I didn't have her I would have certainly relapsed. I literally thought about how if we broke up it would be OK because I could finally have heroin again. But she got me past that point. She took care of me and helped me and eventually I no longer wanted heroin. I knew that if I even had it in my face I could say no. It was great. We have/had our issues. I helped her with her own mental health (not drug related) and things were good. In July my dad had back pain. My family never knew about my addiction. I kept it hidden from them and they knew nothing. So when he kept a bottle of hydros on the counter it seemed perfectly fine. Why would he need to put them where it was a pain to get to ya know? For the first 2 weeks I was ok. My girlfriend talked me though things and I was ok. Eventually it got harder. It's one thing to say no once, or twice, or for a week. But everyday gets too hard. Moving the pills didn't help, they had been in my mind for too long. I was getting too taxing on my GF. And so I relapsed. I got high and my family noticed the missing pills. They had finally found out. They were devastated. I ended up telling them about the past and they were crushed. My gf was devastated. She ended up self harming for the first time and that started a battle for her that she is still struggling with. I can never forget how badly I hurt the people I care about the most. How my family was shocked. My gf looked like she was at deaths door. It was so horrible. And it makes me so mad at myself. If I had quit heroin just like that I would have been proud of stopping. It was on my own terms and I did because I decided to. I would be almost 2 years sober today instead of just now hitting 1. This is just a reminder of the day I got too weak and hurt the people I love. They don't blame me anymore, but I still blame me. I can't be proud of this no matter how badly I want to be. Idk if anyone else goes through shit like this, ik my situation is no where near as bad as most peoples but it still sucks and I feel like you guys are the only people who can really understand. Thanks for listening to my ramblings. ",1533180008.0

She’d been nodded out until we got to northern Alabama. Once we stopped there, she made me buy obscene amounts of candy and soda. She also asked me to check the oil when I put gas in, but she stayed in the car. There was barely any oil on the dipstick. What was there was black like coffee left on a hot pot all day. It looked chunky. I said,

“Yeah. It looks great, baby,” from under the hood. I was about finished with her anyway. I could feel the monster trying to claw himself free from the box inside of my brain. She wouldn’t fair well, if he got out, and she pulled the things she did. Anyway, it wouldn’t matter once I got away from her whether the car had oil or not. That would be her problem.

After driving 13 hours Gabriella and I spent the night in a hotel on the coast of Alabama. I rented the room at the office and opened it for her. The day had gone well. Of course, there was the typical bickering. She was always good for that. In the room, there wasn’t much heroin left, and since I hadn’t gotten a habit going since I relapsed with her, I let her have it. I was just happy to be out of Ohio where no one was watching the news that offered a reward for information leading to my arrest.

The blue and green flicker of the TV glowed through the curtains in our room. I sat on the beach in the moonlight and listened to the surf breaking on the sand and thought about Oregon and Arizona. I had never been to either state and both had cities where the street life was happening, or so I’d heard. Arizona would be warmer and drier. Oregon had a certain pull on me, even though it would be wet and cold. It was a place I’d wanted to go since I was a kid. Both had plenty of heroin according to all reports I ever got.

The prospect of leaving her and going back to the streets put a warm lump of hope or nostalgia or something sentimental, and I walked back to the room. She was sleeping when I opened the door. A movie played on HBO. I fell asleep quickly.

Now, I don’t know where she got the clothes iron, but she did. She may have brought it. It may have been a part of the room. I’m not sure about where it came from. I just know that the distinct sound of my own skin’s moisture popping against the hot metal held to my forehead woke me up that morning. Gabriella was up. We had no connections in Alabama. I’d lied about Florida. So, she burned me with the iron. I can’t say it wasn’t expected, or at least something like it.

I pulled my pants on. I ran for the door. Rain fell in freezing drops the size of grapes from the sky and a wind ripped up the street as I walked faster. Everything with her and leaving my sister and being so weak caught up to me, and as hard as I fought it, I cried. I bawled in the rain walking down the street in just my jeans. A car pulled up behind me and then slowly creeped along with me. Maybe they would help. Maybe they’d have an answer or ask me to get in and take me far away from my life and myself and everything else I hated so much and couldn’t figure out, but when I turned towards them, a middle-aged man with a crew cut leaned over the steering wheel to see past his wife, who was gawking from the passenger seat. A child pointed and smiled from the back. I moaned pathetically and reached out towards them and stumbled to put my face to the window and beg for their help.  It was as if I could sense their humanity bubbling up within their chests so that they would, so that they must help this pitiful, half naked creature crying like a child in the freezing rain -- me.

My senses must have been wrong, though. The mother reached back to hide the child’s eyes from seeing me, and the engine revved. Tail pipe blasted smog at my face. Tires splashed cold gutter water all over me. I cried harder and decided to walk back to the hotel. At least there, I would be able to sit on the balcony outside of the room where it was dry. Maybe Gabriella would let me in.

The curtains were closed. The lights were off from what I could tell. It looked like no one was in the room when I got back. I leaned over the railing and let my tear drops fall to the pavement below. A one-story drop wouldn’t even break my legs, maybe sprain an ankle, but there was no way I could expect the fall to kill me. Then, I looked towards the sea. I’ve never been a very good swimmer. The storm had caused the waves to break violently against the shore. All I would have to do is swim towards the horizon for as long as I could. There was no way I would be able to make it back.

Before I could make the stairs, a pair of young black men wearing torn white tshirts on their heads like bandanas met me as they were coming out of their room. They took one look at me and asked,

“Whatsa poblem? Why you cryin’? You a mon. Don’ cry.”

They asked me if I was a “Jesus person.” They asked me if I liked “da Boy.” Both questions confused me, but soon I got it figured out. The answers were no and yes respectively.

I said, “No. Not a Jesus person. Yes. I like da boy.”

“Come in. You have money.” I think it was a question, like he was asking if I had money. It just didn’t sound like one. And I did have money.

In the room, they sat me in a chair at the small table against the wall and produced a brittle, brown brick the size of a wallet. They cut a bit off and put it on the table. I couldn’t even see what they’d given me, but I trusted it was there and put my nose to it and snorted. My eyes watered. I got queasy.

“You like dat mon.” It was supposed to be another question. I nodded and stumbled towards the door and puked over the balcony. They didn’t ask for any money. They just said they’d be there if I wanted more.

I woke up covered in the white beach sand grit. An angry Gabriella was standing over me. It was getting dark and had quit raining at some point. All I could remember, though, were the two Jamaicans or Haitians or whoever they were pulling me into their room. Gabriella said I needed to go pay for another night. She’d been locked out and looking for me all day, so she said. I could tell by her voice that she’d gotten something somewhere. Maybe all the dope she didn’t do or share with me from the day before. I don’t know.

The next morning started off better. It was sunny and warmer. She didn’t wake me up by burning the skin off my face or turn any other appliances into medieval torture devices. She hadn’t started a fight, even. We went to breakfast at a diner down the street. I wore a pair of cheap aviators I’d stolen from a gas station a few days before. In my mind, somehow, the glasses were a disguise to keep people from noticing the piece of burned flesh on my forehead, hanging off like a gnarly piece of dried out pepperoni, all curled up and black and green and crusty. It didn’t work. The glasses only covered my eyes. I knew that. The waitress and anyone else who saw me that morning did a double take and stared awkwardly at it when they talked to me. A fatter man and his pretty wife at another table gave me a look of understanding, like he knew exactly what had happened when he saw it. It made me feel better though, to wear the glasses. So, I did.

When we got back to the room, the two men I’d seen the day before were standing outside of the room. Gabriella was wearing those gym shorts that must have belonged to a skinny 8th grader, and they choked her thighs and butt in a way that made it hard for men not to look. One man slapped the other’s shoulder and pointed at her as we entered the room. Inside of the room, she asked me where we could score.

“I know you were high yesterday, Clyde.”

I told her to wait in the room and went back to the other room. The two men were standing outside waiting for me. There were 50 bucks left in my pocket, and they gave me a generous portion of the fuzzy looking granules in three gel caps for it. That was the last of the money.

“Hey, mon, we like you chick.”

“You just don’t know here well enough, then, mon.” I laughed, trying to do my best islander accent. They didn’t understand.

“We pay. We take her. Our boat comes at sunrise, tomorrow.” They didn’t want her for the night. I’d never had a chick like that long enough to let one pay for our dope that way anyway, but they wanted something more permanent.

“Let me think about it. I’ll come see you later.”

The truth is that I would have never sold Gabriella to the Haitians or Jamaicans or whatever they were. She was terrible to me. The last two or three days, though, were good. Well, they were okay, and you’d have to forget about the incident with the iron to say that. Something inside of me loved her still. Something inside of me wanted to make it work with her and held onto the moments when she was just a little less crappy so that it could work. Maybe, I was just weak. Anyone else would have left her. I never would have. There’s no question about it, but Boom Boom on the other hand, well, he’s a different story.

She did most of the dope in the capsules. I only did a little and got sick. Gabriella woke me up in the middle of the night. She was naked and sweet and sweating soon after that. We had fun. We shared a cigarette in bed, glistening in the dark and blew smoke at the ceiling. She started a shower. *This was it.* I thought. *This was love.* She was not who she’d been, really. I’d finally found it, the thing called love, that I’d so desperately pined for. My mother was all I had ever known of it, and she was gone. A warm spring of hope and happiness babbled in my chest. Angels were singing. This was love, but in the shower, she farted in my mouth, again. She even laughed, like it was cute.

Now, it’s always difficult explaining the whole Boom Boom thing to people, because obviously, he and I exist in the same body. It’s just not clear exactly where the line is drawn. There are somethings about Clyde, that are the same about Boom Boom. So, maybe, it’s not necessarily two distinct personalities but severely altered versions of the same person. Like I said, it’s difficult to explain, and it’s also difficult to know exactly when the line is crossed from Clyde to Boom Boom or Boom Boom to Clyde. I just know it was some time after she farted in my mouth in the shower and laughed.

She watched TV. I told her I’d be back with some more heroin and went to visit the men. They were up. The payment filled a cigarette cellophane so fully that when I melted it shut at the top with my lighter, some of the dope got melted into it. I wrapped it in a napkin for safety, deciding to revisit the packaging situation once Gabriella was gone.

“Babes, look what they gave me!”

“WHAT! No way!”

“Yeah. The guys are just a few doors down. They say they want to meet you personally. I gotta take a dump, though, so just go on over. You’ll see ‘em. Their door is open.” Those were the last words I ever spoke to her.

As the sun came up, I sat on the balcony. It was beautiful. I had walked to the 24-hour grocery store and bought a six pack of root beer in glass bottles. It was for the toast. You know, I would stick a needle in my veins with the most poisonous chemical concoctions you could dream up, if it would get me off, but I hated alcohol.

Their door opened. It looked like Gabriella was lethargic from whatever drugs she’d done with them, but it was hard to tell. She had a pillowcase over her head and duct tape around her neck. Her hands were bound behind her back, and the men were strong besides. She didn’t give much fight physically, but for a few kicks here and there. I could hear her muffled screams. I imagined she was saying my name.

There was a buzzing in the distance getting louder and closer all the time. Eventually, a rickety long boat made of what looked like trash pushed onto the shore from the water. The men took Gabriella, gagged and bound, over their shoulders and into the boat. I lifted my bottle of root beer to the men. They waved back, and the driver let off his horn. That was our toast.

I don’t know whatever happened to her. Maybe, she lives still in some Haitian rape dungeon. Maybe, she was chopped up into pieces and sold for the price of her organs. I don’t know. I don’t care, but I do know that I remembered that notebook with the stories in it, as the boat road off into the vast expanse of the see. It was in the car, so I went to get it.

I opened it on the hood and let the sun warm my neck and head as I read the last story in it. My palms were on the car and fingers splayed. It was called, “I’ll never see that house again.” Whoever wrote it must have written it about their grandmother and her house. It went like this.

*I’ll never see that house again.*

*And I won’t see her either.*

*We spent every summer there and, in the mornings, she cooked pancakes in bacon grease from a mason jar or biscuits and sausage with strawberry preserves. We drank cold milk from the plastic cups from the shelf under her set of olive-green colony glass tea tumblers she’d had since the 1970s.*

*We watched cartoons with older cousins after breakfast or made tree forts anywhere on the five acres she kept sequestered from the new neighborhoods and traffic with trees and brush. There was a club house on the side of the garden in the field. It had windows and a door. It was where our uncle molested us.*

*It was where my own father grew up, way back when the road was only one lane and made of gravel. He told me the front yard had been a dense, dark forest of cane when he was a kid. That was hard to believe. He told me the day he came home from the hospital, the pipes froze at the house and his head had been mangled by the forceps they used to deliver him. “I always wondered what my daddy thought that day,” he used to tell me, not that he remembered it, but he knew the story. “I always wondered what my daddy thought, coming home from the hospital, his son looking like some purple, smashed face monkey with a busted head and ice all over the kitchen floor.” Things had been different then.*

*My grandmother cut her own field until the day she broke her leg. She slipped on a clip from a clothes hanger at the department store looking for a deal. It was the end of her. Physical therapy had been too much. She never got out of the wheelchair. Eventually, one of her eyes went caddywompas—in her own words—meaning it went sideways while the other looked straight. We suspected it was from all the Tab she drank in the 1980s. Too much aspartame.*

*She was known to cry over nothing. Once she started weeping at the kitchen sink, because there was an airplane in the sky out the window and the people inside of it had just said goodbye to all the people they loved before boarding. Her face was as ugly as a face can get when it came to crying.*

*She liked to say, “Well, ain’t that a bunch of sh\*t.” It usually was.*

*She accused people of “flim flamming her.” They usually were.*

*She accused the grandkids of always being one step ahead of her. We definitely were.*

*She used to sip Diet Coke from a glass and chew ice cubes or a toothpick when she sat on her love seat next to a pile of outdated tabloids. She sowed all the curtains in the house, in the 60s. She told me how she’d set the kitchen on fire once and how the finish on the cabinets wasn’t the original. It had all been burned off in the fire.*

*She died though. Rolled that wheel chair to the end of her long hallway, crawled into bed and died.*

*Was it cold?*

*Was she scared?*

*Did she cry out or did something visit her when it happened?*

*Now, her children are selling the property and house. It’s five acres. A strange redhaired couple with an Indonesian financer came to look at it. They wore collared shirts that had emblems of two triangles and the letter S running through them. The place will be sold to Scientologists. It will be one of their compounds.*

*I can see her now, sitting on her love chair and looking up from the paper to say, “Ain’t that a bunch of sh\*t?”*

*I'll never see her again, though.*

*And I won't see that house, either.*

When I finished the story, I turned around and fell back onto the hood of the car. A skinny blond woman in flip flops and shorts with a large, Fleur delis tattoo on her shoulder and a red skinned, kinky haired baby in her arms asked me for a cigarette.

“Sure. They’re in my room, though. You’ll have to follow me.”

“K.” She waited outside of the door. Her eye was swollen shut and turning a shiny greenish black color. “Are you leaving town?” She asked.

“Yeah.”

“Where you going?”

“Not sure.”

“Can you take me with you?”

“I think so.”

“Good. I need it. What’s your name anyway?”

“My name is…..” I was about to say Clyde, but I adjusted, “You can call me Boom Boom.”",1533179385.0

TL;DR: AT the bottom. 

It took me so many months to finally schedule this test at $30 a test, 4 test and I’m finally taking my second ones. I’m going through a lot of arguing in my relationship all week (7 days for sure) and the test is tomorrow and she is aware and stress is my biggest distraction *when it comes to people I love. Especially when they take up all my hours of my days talking about suicide and had to stop an attempt this morning*

That being said, I’m afraid to sleep home with my partner (I’m male, she’s female probably doesn’t matter gender), I would feel less stressed and safer being over my cousins but my girlfriend will get spite and mean if I even mention walking to the corner store for water even with 90+ days free of opiates except last night because I couldn’t cope with the hours of stress she put on me and stopping a suicide attempt that triggered my PTSD of dead parents from suicide and tried my hardest to cope and it took over completely.

So I’m off my Suboxone for 3 days now I believe and I relapsed yesterday. This test is so important to me because without a GED, no military for me. Or any college that I could afford.

Having took 450mg morphine ER chewed last night with 2mg Pharmacy Xanax and didn’t even feel it kick in until I was sleeping, basically, and upon awakening because I slept in an opiate position with severe shoulder pain and stuff in my mouth like I threw up in my sleep (thankful I didn’t die) and Suboxone not blocking my receptors. Basically took 180mg morph. First then the remaining 270mg morph at night, confused why I didn’t feel it as strong.

Also will mention in the TL;DR below all the meds I have access to that may help. 

*TL;DR: Finally scheduled GED tests to get into military/college, girlfriend of 5 years I love and live with being controlling and extremely stressed. Had over 90+ days clean from opiates/drugs except Suboxone my maintenance med until last night, seeing her attempt suicide triggered me and relapsed of 450mg oral morphine. I really need to past this test tomorrow and I need peaceful sleep, little to no stress so I can focus and my cousins house offers me that, but my girl practically doesn’t let me leave the house at all and I’m always with her and got off Oxy/Morphine for her —all after both partners dying and I’m now 20. I need to take an opioid to focus such as Oxycodone that I can acquire but all I have is buprenorphine (Suboxone). Here’s meds below that I have and I need advice about this whole sleeping out stress free when communication failed please thank you.*

I have: At least x30 Valium 2mg 
I don’t exceed 10-20mg 

x12 Adderall 20mg IR (I don’t abuse)
I Only take 1 tablet 

Over x60 Klonopin 1mg 
(I won’t exceed 2mg)

x10 real/pharmaceutical made 
Xanax 2mg (I only take for emergencies)

x12 Suboxone tablet 8/2mg
(Was only taking 2mg twice daily)

He had a girlfriend or a wife, and would occasionaly go to work, that is, pilote planes on heroin. He used to just snort and didn't take too much before work, just enough to be well, since he couldn't work high without risking a plane crash. In this particular day, he decided to wrap the dope on foil and take it with him in his pocket or in his hand baggage. What he really wanted was to make the flight and then go to his hotel to get high.

What could go wrong, uh? After all, airplane pilots were searched or supervised rarely, only a few times. Well, that day ended up being on one of those rare occasions in which pilots are checked.

The dope on foil was found and his excuse was that that was vitamin powder. He said he couldn't take the vitamin capsules for some reason that I'm not sure, so his doctor told him to take the vitamin powder off the capsules and take just the powder. Agents were called and started interrogating him to see if he would contradict himself in his excuse. He was trained to go through situations of tension and pression, so he would answear fast and never contradicted anything he already mentioned before. The agents thought the H was crack (???), and after much tension he was dispensed. He had gotten away!

So he was relieved and decided to make this reddit post telling us this story with an alternate account, since he commented on flight/ plane/ pilots subs though his main account. When he was answearing the comments, that motherfuker accidentally entered his original main account to comment, so then we ""knew"" who this guy was and he could be caught more easily. Fucking nuts!

I remember there were people in the comments telling him he would be soon tested for drugs, so that he should detox. There were people saying it was stupid for him to do that post. And there were people shocked that there are pilots out there piloting planes on heroin. I understand the people who were shocked, but I guess if he was doing only enough to get well before work, not actually flying planes high on dope, well, that may not be the ideal situation, but it's better than him flying planes while withdrawling. Talk about a crazy story. It didn't take long for him to delete the post. Anyone else remember this? Please tell me I'm not the only one who remember that post!",1533169739.0

---


My first encounter with heroin was age 10

I wrote a song for my band, picked up my pad and with my pen

I scribbled ""chasing the dragon"" at the top of the page

Wanted to be famous, wanted to get up on that stage

Wanted to speak of things I'd never played with before

Wanted to get into to the game, wanted to go on tour

When I was twelve I learned my brother was in jail

Five years, cocaine, tried to be Escobar but failed

By that point two years I knew I was destined

Obsessed with coke cause drugs are interesting

Learned about ozzy osbourne and his special predilection

School was easy, grades were good

But the temptation was festering




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




The first drug I tried was an XR Adderall

Turned eleven and couldn't give a single fuck at all

At school, sold my best friend a bag of Tylenol

Charged 20 dollars and spent the money at the mall

Next day I'm approached, and I'm thinking ""oh fuck""

He said ""man, the high was good, but the taste, it sucks""

I told him, ""I know, the expensive coke is better.""

For years I followed that scheme to the letter

Then one day, teenage, I tried a bag of coke

Fast forward a month later, I was sniffing dope

Selling bags of ice to fiends and bumming packs of smokes

Not old enough to drive, on the weekends I blew meth smoke,

I thought: man, life is so much better when you're nodding and getting high 

Had the needle in my arm when tolerance multiplied




It's easy to look at someone and say it's your fault

But do we really deserve the pain and the insult?

We all fucking know we're not good role models

And with the gamble and the money it's like playing the lotto

When misguided youth turn to using the needle

Don't treat em like animals, cause we're all still people




I bet you still think that I wanted this for myself

That I wanted to care about drugs over my health 

That's why society is fucked, we're still fucking people,

We're not drug addicts all because we're fucking evil,

It's not true, I swear I'm the sweetest fucking person,

Yall looking at me like my hobby is committing arson,

And I'm supposed to be cool with that, it's fine?

I'm the scum of the earth because I liked being high?

Fuck that, take a look at your own fucking parents,

It's not okay because drinking's where the cash's spent,

So back it up before you cast the first stone,

I'm sure you have some sins for which you should atone.

So I got pretty addicted back in 2015ish. Got on buprenorphine slowly tapered down from 4mg to 0.6mg a day. Recently, a few months ago, I was put on weekly pick ups. Was great at first but I've been struggling with taking my doses daily and not snorting doses to get that meagre ""high"". It's sort of culminated in me using (oral morphine) again ""just to get through"" to when I can pick up my weekly allowance of buprenorphine. For what it's worth I'm aware of how much of a dickhead I am, and I'm gonna quit my bullshit and start taking the buprenoprhine I'm prescribed properly from tomorrow, when I pick up my weekly allowance.

I'm aware that buprenorphine can block full agonists. I last took buprenorphine yesterday, 0.4mg snorted. I thought at such a low dose I wouldn't notice much blocking. When I first took the morphine today I felt that really heavy feeling in my arms and legs, and my nose and eyes dried up, stomach settled down, etc. Even a little euphoria, or at least physical pleasure. But subsequent redoses seem to have had no effect, even to the point where I feel like I'm in withdrawals now. Is this normal? Why would I be in withdrawals if I keep redosing morphine? Can the buprenorphine block the full agonist from working but at the same time be too little to keep you out of withdrawals? I feel strange. I can feel the morphine working a little bit, but I also feel like I'm in withdrawals at the same time.

Should I take a .2mg buprenorphine to see what happens? I'm pretty scared of precipitated withdrawals, but if I feel like I'm in withdrawal it should be ok right? Or are those words I'm gonna regret? I'm leaning towards no because I can just about feel the effects of the morphine, but my back is aching like a mofo and I'm sweating for no reason... Just feel like I'm both slightly high and in withdrawals at the same time, it's very strange... 

I guess the lesson to learn would be don't fuck around when on maintenance meds.

93s2ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93s2ru/life_is_alright_at_4am/,3,https://redd.it/93s2ru,sloan_fitch,Life is alright at 4am,"Last night just after 4am I was biking home from working on an ongoing project with a friend as well as viewing episodes of SG1. Mostly a quiet ride, I did not get a chance to watch a street resurfacer do it's thing as I did earlier that evening. I did however get to ride my bike over roughly stripped roads which will soon be paved over to complete the resurfacing process.

&nbsp;

Within the final half mile as I turned off a main thoroughfare onto a main sidestreet, I saw what appeared to a kid on a bike. What is a twelve year old doing riding a bicycle at 4am? Well, whatever.. he ain't a trickster or a showoff so at least I don't have to worry about being served. You know, like when someone break dances better than you and you have no comeback. That's what happens when someone pops a wheelie around me. It's not really my riding style and although I've done some tricky maneuvers on my bike that require  fancy foot work but usually only when it's practical to do so. Jump a curb, cut diagonally across a golf course and the occasional jaunt through the woods. 


&nbsp;


**The kid on the bike** was maintaining a steady velocity so I decided increase mine and pass on the left. As I was already three car lengths ahead and acclerating my name is called, ""hey sloansoid."" I look and I realize, that twelve year old on a bike is actually Derrick. He's small like that, mostly short. Actually has fair muscle tone, though Tim still believes he could beat the shit out of him but that's another story and a theory that will hopefully never be tested. You know, in the name of peace. 


&nbsp;


Being the courteous individual that I am, I slowed down and circled back. My velocity was so great that I had to do two 360s before Derrick had caught up with me. From there, I was practically coasting and still moving faster. It wasn't difficult but it took a concious effort to brake and match his velocity. Wonder why he was out biking at 4am?


&nbsp;


**It became abundantly clean when** he pointed at it was Tuesday at at 4am. Well, technically Wednesday but the new day starts when I wake up as far as I'm concerned. What happens at 4am on Wednesdays? Cliff or his mom gets paid. I'm not really sure who's pay day it is since it all goes to the same account in his mom's name. For all I know all of the money is due for her and Cliff is making up the existence of his monthly disability money. When we used to hang out he would refer to one of his monthly direct deposits as ""big money"", such as ""Wednesday is my big money day."" An example being, ""Do you have $40 I can borrow, I got you next Wednesday, that's when I get my big money.""


&nbsp;


**What is abundantly clear?** Derrick was biking on his way back from the ATM with Cliff's card and money. The next phase of the operation for him was to meet up with his plug. We parted ways at the corner, I took the slightly more scenic route home in order ensure that I did not stumble into Cliff. Before parting ways I wished Derrick luck with timing - we all know what it can be like waiting for our respective plugs. When I got home I saw Derrick pulling into his driveway a few houses down - he must've stopped off at Cliff's on the way back to drop off the debit card or something. He often has to bike to the plug but if he was going home I suspect the plug was coming to him that night. 



&nbsp;

That last part doesn't really matter to me. I'm glad not being part of the equation anymore. Last few times I was involved for the 4am pick-up were factors in my choice to stop doing dope altogether. Even w hen I had used my own plugs, it was hard for me not to avail myself for a couple of free bags although I eventually concluded the price was too high for that benefit. There was always a ""gotcha"" or ""by the way"" when dealing with Cliff in what should be a simple endeavor. 



&nbsp;


Sometimes I'd hang out for four hours beforehand, but with the advent of bed bugs the couch became inhospitable. As the infestation got worse, even metal chairs at the kitchen table were no longer safe! I'd see the little buggers on my shirt and pick them off individually, I'd get home, strip down in my freezing backyard and hold my shirt up to the light to see a juvenile bug. I once hung out for four hours binging of Stargate Universe a series I never really watched prior. I watched soldiers in a desert while I wore my winter coat indoors. That very coat is still in my backyard, I've never taken it inside my home again since that night. 



&nbsp;

Without reflecting and recanting past events which I'm saving for another post, I am just glad. Just because Cliff would get paid at 4am didn't mean I'd have my dope by 5am. It always took longer for different reasons. On one occaisons Derrick told Cliff he wanted to stop at home on the way back, get straight and the deliver the dope wheras Cliff would demand delivery first. Derrick would argue that he put the effort in and should be entitled to that. Then there's the other fact, Cliff preferred Derrick to deliver all of the dope first so that he could select choose and distribute Derrick's earnings. 


&nbsp;


There was always a push-pull between Cliff and Derrick regarding timing and expectations. The results of which would inevitably funnel down to me. Seeing Derrick last night once again reminded me of how great it is not to depend on the whims of other individuals at 4am to get doep. I mean yeah, I still depend on the whims of other individuals but at least I have a greater sense of control since Suboxone is a longer acting opioid. If someone is two days late on delivery of goods during a busy work week - things no longer spiral rapidly out of control. None of that feeling anxiety, physically sick, the chills and that general sense of the lighting looking different because I ran out of my drug eighteen hours ago and have been getting strung along since. 


&nbsp;


Now, when I get strung along by a connect for subs I usually still have a few days of of medication and have been able to ration it further to make it last longer with great ease. As far as I'm concerned right now, even when I feel mopey - **la vita es bella.** 


&nbsp;



The flow has not ended, but further reflection and detail on things like the monthy 4am bike ride to the ATM shall be relegated to future post.

&nbsp;

#tl;dr: 

Saw Derrick the middle biking back from the ATM on Cliff's behest while I was on my way home from studying and gardening and watching TV sci-fi. It reminded me of how good life is now in comparison to a couple of months ago when it was hard to resist the opportunity to bike to the ATM for Cliff's fat ass in order to earn 20% of a single bundle in addition to buying myself some dope if I had the money. Cliff used to also sometimes extend me credit if I was broke but never 50% of the order as he used to expect from me. Doesn't matter now, just feels good to reflect on it instead of actively dealing with it.

We just moved 1200 miles away. We have been together for 8 years & have an 11M old baby. He swears he isn’t but he’s acting so strange. I guess it could be cheating but I don’t think so. We’re on subs, but I know his true love is coke. I was going through the baby bag & found 2 spoons & a lighter. Yes the baby plays with spoons, but he could never reach his bag. Then I found a spoon & lighter in MY suitcase!!! I KNOW I didn’t put it in there. I hear his texts go off but he always deletes them. I’m just at my wits end. I’m an addict so I know how it works. He will lie. And now that we have a baby, it just worries me. He NEVER answers his phone(when I call.) 

I just need confirmation or to catch him in the act. He takes a shower before & after work! This is causing me so much stress, I want to use. And now I’m far from my family, so I’m basically alone. Maybe count all the subs & see if he’s actually taking them?? I just need to know. And to wait until we move to do this?? After a baby?? He claims I’m paranoid, but I really don’t think so. It’s driving me insane.

EDIT:We just used our life savings to buy a house down here. No mortgage, we spent 145,000 & are fixing it up. But its all in my name. Everything, his truck, my car, the house. The ONLY thing that isn’t is his motorcycle. But I’m not a bitch. I won’t take it all even though I easily could. I just want him to stop & get help, but he won’t admit it. He’s freaking 50 years old. This is his ONLY child. But thats how addiction works. He’s gonna die at this point. I cry as I sit here typing this. And he knows theres no where for me to run to(aka my parents) since were so far. I texted him 20 mins ago telling him we HAVE to have a talk after the baby goes to bed.

I’ve been using opiates since i was 13, I got addicted because I broke my arm which resulted in me getting a lovely tramadol script.
The script ended so for years i scavenged my parents drug drawer(they both have serious back problems so there wasn’t an exact drought of opioids in our house) and i found codeine and morphine.
Later i switched on to dope and ive been using for 4 years on and off (dont feel like telling my age) 
I can’t imagine my life sober, it won’t be worth it.
Ive rotated with IV use and snorting, but i’m startig IV use again tomorrow.
No one should tell me to stop because it is a neverending cycle i can’t get out of, hell i don’t even want to.

Is this a common thing?,"Ok a couple weeks ago I met someone who told me she has a sugar daddy that spends rediculous amounts of money on her, pretty much everyday. 

This lady is probably in her late 40s, and is missing damn near every tooth.  She smokes hella crack and then goes to town on herself picking at her skin with a pair of tweezers.  To sum it up, she is no model and has alot of wear on her from the lifestyle.  

So as I get to work with her more, she tells me all kinds of things about her sugar daddy.  (She seems very proud of it)
-The guy is in his mid 80s, and can barely walk.
They have never had sex together and are not romantic
He leaves hours away and the only conversations they seem to have are this lady screaming demands into the phone at her man.

Ok so I hear from her that, family members of the man have been contacting this lady asking her to find someone else to cling onto. Her response, ""those bitches just want his money when he dies, but they aint gettin it""
-I guess she has got over $450,000!! In less than 2 years from this guy, and hearing that made me almost puke.  She made a off hand statement that she has depleted his entire retirement fund.

So to me this situation is pretty fucked up and sick.  This crack head old witch of a lady is draining some old mans retirement fund.  His family needs to get a power of attorney and get his banks to not allow the transactions.

This was my first exposure to the sugar daddy world.  Tho it seems way common around my area, just talking with female users in the last couple of weeks.  Alot have said this was one of the main ways they or people they know supported themselves.  Whats up with this? As a guy I sure as shit wouldnt be cool handing my money off like that.

Unfortunately it then turned more into a psychedelic, can't escape your demons, pull out all your deepest issues and stab them in your eyes type thing. The first experience, I took my very last bit of H(probably around 20mg) first thing in the morning when I woke up. I had used 200mg the days and months before all intranasal. About 3 hours after that dose I started to feel the minor WD come on so I started popping 300mg gabas one at a time. I knew about spacing them apart an hour-2 to maximize absorption. About 6 hours and 900mg gabapentin later I'm feeling pretty damn alright... Great actually. Music's enhanced, really getting into TV shows. Also just walking around messing with/observing objects in my home and completing mundain tasks became extremely interesting, just as a lot of dissociative drugs make things look sort of new in a way. It was a great high I must say. But best of all no signs of WD whatsoever... Not even cravings. Around midnight or so I don't even remember past this point I popped like a half a Xanax. Next thing I know it's about 10 hours later and I'm waking up like sleeping beauty. That's the first thing that popped in my mind is God damn I slept well and I feel beautiful right now. I continued to have a fantastic after glow the entire day. Easiest day of running dry I every experienced..  

Now the next time, I did pretty much everything the same. Mind you I had started IV not too long ago which may have had a major impact. My dose increased from 200mg a day intranasal to about 200-300mg IV. I dosed the tiny bit of my stash around the same time, started popping gabas and about 4-5 hours in I get EXTREMELY.. extremely emotional. I'm sitting for what felt like hours washing cottons like 3-4 times each trying to get a fix but getting nothing. I broke down crying on the floor looking at the needle in my arm. I continued to cry countless times that night. It seemed as if I had been instantly smacked in the face with all of the demons that this comfy warm heroin blanket had been covering up. The experience was very psychedelic and dissociative in a sense that's hard to describe. I've tried many many many classes of drugs and none of those experiences ever came close this gabapentin one. Maybe DXM or MXE In terms of the general dissociation from body and mind.  But gabapentin is incredibly unique and I'd say it's very set and setting dependant. I'd describe my first experience as sort of a euphoric dissociative benzo if that makes sense. What I'd image GHB to be like(one of the few substances I haven't tried). I didn't have any trouble running dry or withdrawing whatsoever. I woke up the next day feeling like a new man. But something about the second experience changed everything very dramatically. The only thing that calmed my emotions for a bit was to take a hike and listen to music. It was very entertaining to stare at the trees, mountains, ground and general landscape very much as if I was on LSD. Same sort of very indrigued headspace as well. But after I got back home I was right back to balling my eyes out. No physical withdrawal symptoms but heavy heavy emotional issues. Didn't sleep nearly as good that night either.  

I'm am still very interested in Gabapentin and potentially Lyrica and hope to try it again. Hopefully not in opiate WD this time although I was blown away by the effectiveness the first time around. All I have to say is gabapentin is certainly one of the most interesting substances I've tried. I was expecting it to be a mild benzodiazapine, I was pretty fuckin far off.",1533126916.0

Awful, didn’t get the appeal. Roughly a year later, took one whole one, and it was lovely.  At that point I determined I shouldn’t get near that ever again.. I liked it too much (also wouldn’t know how to get my hands on it)

But I’m a regular coke user (every other week at most if I’m in the mood) and it’s getting old. 

Are there any recreational opiate users that don’t consider themselves (honestly) addicted? Is it possible? What’s it called.. dabbing? What’s the word...

Anyway, I’m not an idiot. I know this isn’t a road I want to go down. But it’s on my mind. I want to feel that nice feeling once in a while on my terms if that makes sense

I’d never ever dreamed I’d ever touch Heroin. I’m 52 years old, grandma of four lil beauties who worship,the ground I walk on. In my 20’ and 30’s I had and on and off problem with vicodins and Percs. Went to rehab, but always went back. 
. Then I was 
Prescribed suboxone 18 years ago. It finally started to cause severe health problems. Wanted off subs so badly. Found out about Kratom, got off subs successfully for 9 months using Kratom daily then tapered off Kratom. I was doing great!  Felt wonderful. Then for some reason my hemoglobin dropped to 6.2. Had several blood transfusions. Had zero energy, hard to breathe. Still undergoing tests to find out what’s causing internal bleeding that’s causing the anemia. 
I gained 50 pounds in less than a month. Literally felt like I was on my death bed. My family doc gave me 10 vicodins to help with the pain. They definitely helped my pain. I felt good enough to cook dinner for family that night.  Tried to get more Vic’s till my endoscopy was scheduled. Doc said sorry, no more. Things went down hill quick again. Started asking around for a few Vic’s. No one had any. BUT an old friend told me to try some heroin. No way was I going to inject. I just wanted a little pain relief. I snorted a very small amount. My “friend” assured me I had no danger of od’ing if I only snorted it. I used approximately 1 gram in a week. with no major problem. 
I knew right away this H was different. It was a different color. I did the same amount I’d been doing and immediately got extreme chills. My faithful, unsuspecting husband said I was burning up. Told him I was getting the flu and going to lay down. He went out to mow grass. I had about a 1/2 gram left that I’d tucked under my bra.  
This is last thing I remember was getting in bed at 4:00 pm.  Then hearing my named screamed over and over by strangers and feeling like my entire body was being pulled downwards and felt like I was just supposed to keep going with whoever was pulling me down. But the people pulling me upwards knew my name and kept telling me to come back and stay with them. My family needed  me. They knew my grandkids names. But the terrifying imaginary creatures pulling me down kept calling me by the wrong name. Going with the people who knew my real name seemed like a better idea, even though slipping downwards felt so blissful.  Until the creatures were getting really upset and started yanking me. I just kept fighting. Finally heard the good guys say”We have her back. She’s breathing”
Then I started talking and puking and truly felt like I was dying but I was breathing and alive. 
Got to the ER and never forget my poor husband standing in front of me telling the emt, Er personnel and cops I don’t do Heroin. Just prescribed a few Vicodin. At that precise moment the nurse pulls my bra up and out falls the little baggie. 
The look on his face will haunt me forever.  At that point they gave me more narcan. Oh dear God.  Ok I deserve this punishment but pleeeease, let this be over soon. 
My daughters were in the waiting room. I was too mortified to see them. That upset them even more. I knew at that point I was a total piece of shit, because the nurse in the ER told me my family wouldn’t want to ever see me and husband would probaly be filing for divorce. After 29 years of marriage I believed her. I was definitely in my right mind,  now wasn’t I?
This same nurse hit me with narcan a 3 rd time till, someone convinced ai didn’t need anymore. Thank you dear sweet someone. Everyone who had anything to do with saving my life Saturday night were amazing and extremely caring. Except this one nurse immediately disliked me the minute I was wheeled into ER. 
They kept me in ICU till mon because my hemaglobin had dropped to 6.4 and had to get 2 units of blood again,My feet and legs and hands swelled like bouncy houses. Did a colonoscopy and another endoscopy which all came out clear. So now I go for a capsule endoscopy. I pray they figure out the cause for the internal bleeding. I just want my life back and the ability to run around with my grandkids again. I learned not to fuck around with Heroin, no matter how small amount and snorting it can cause one to overdose. 
My husband and daughters are just relieved I’m ok and I’m back home and feel so fortunate my husband came in early from mowing grass to get a drink of water and found me non responsive. He gave me cpr and mtm I’m told and called 911. He thought I was already dead. 
I honestly didn’t care for the Heroin, but it was all I could find and it definitely helped

I cold copped recently from the same block Ive been going to, but from a different dude. The boy Ive been getting has been a brown powder in the typical east coast stamp bags, just like all the dope I had done before this relapse. But this time he wasnt on the block, so I bought from another dude, who (aside from ripping me off a bit but hey, price to play) gave me a bag in a white stamp with decidedly different substance. When I poured it out, it was clumpier (?), and needed to be chopped significantly more. Also its a pure white color, like white-as-snow white. Initially I kinda panicked, thinking he had REALLY ripped me off and since I copped it back on friday night and have to wait every week until tuesday-friday to get high (long and shamrful story). But then I considered the idea that it might just be fentanyl. Ive never used fentanyl, aside from whatever fent has been in the bags Ive been using already, so I really dont know what it looks like powdered. I had a lollipop once but that was it. Like I imagine the dope I had been getting has just been real heroin cut with fent, and maybe this bag is just fent cut with another white substance? Does any more experienced user know what it could be? I overdosed once off of a hot bag and there have been literally hundreds of OD's in my city in the past couple weeks, so Im kinda wary. But also desperately would like to not get ripped off and be able to enjoy my few noddable days. I apologize for my inexperience, although things got serious for me quick I still havent been too long in the dope world.

Help would be greatly appreciated, love you all and stay safe out there!

[UPDATE] Ive been looking forward to tonight for so long, so I decided bump some in a realtively safe way, just in case. I split one bag into 8 teeny-tiny lines, and hit my first one. Let me just say: I was FUCKED UP but it startrd o fade just a little bit later. So I redosed again to keep it up, and Im halfway through the bag.

The Oil Joint had no end of characters and one of the worst was Leprechaun or just Lep. Your first question is “Did he look like a leprechaun?” and the answer is YES. He stood about 5’6”, so he was short and stocky. He bathed infrequently, and he wore the same stinky overalls day after day, occasionally changing his T\-shirt.  Like a leprechaun, Lep had a scraggly red beard, a holdover from slave days. Most importantly, Lep loved gold in whatever form and HE WAS EVIL. He had absolutely no remorse and would chalk up his evilness to “THE GAME”.

Lep had just been released from prison after serving 30\+ years for murder. I didn’t ask the particulars; I didn’t want to know. Consequently, Lep had that hair\-trigger temper that men develop in prison. A joke instantly became an attack on his manhood and you felt that violence was simmering just below the surface, ready to explode. Worse still, Lep always had a weapon. His favorite was a knife, but he had no qualms about smashing your face with a bottle or whatever else was handy. He also had an old piece of shit 25 auto from Charter Arms or Raven Arms or one of those bottom tier gun makers. The thing would jam every third shot and was just as likely to hurt the shooter as the shootee.  Webster should show a picture of Lep’s gun in their listing for Saturday Night Special. And to top it all off, Lep was the most racist man that I’ve ever met. He hated all white people just because they were white.

A leprechaun must have his pot of gold and Lep’s gold was crack. Disregarding quality, Lep was an awesome dealer. For example, he would deliver 24x7, he was on\-time and his bags were heavy. The quality was crap, but he would use coca cola to “brown” his crack and vinegar to “smell” his H.  Lep’s dirtiest trick was to give\-out samples of the good stuff and once the customer was on a run and desperate for a hit, Lep would sell them the crappy stuff. It was all part of THE GAME.",1533083440.0

I used to think I was getting straight fire #3 cause of the dark color, then #4 cause it was almost white in color. Then I realized it’s hella rare to get#3 in the stAtes specially on east coast, but then read something that was super strange to me which was #4 was a complete waste and doesn’t smoke well. Well that made me looking into why the hell is my #4 smoking as well as like tar until I read how well some fent analouges smoke and figured that must be why. But I am now like obsessed with it and can’t stand what I assume is real #4 cause I can’t smoke it. These white chunks break down super easily and when smoked, turn clearing white then a like dark amber color when they tar up and smoke beautifully. I can even just put a Little Rock on and chase it like you would a ball of tar.
Has any one else experienced this or am I just crazy? This shit also lasts keeping me well for like 10-15 hrs so it can’t be just straight fent 

TLDR: Realized my #4 is a large majority if not all a fent analogue which is the reason it smokes SO well and has become my obsessive ROA, even over real dope. Anyone else?

93cch1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93cch1/cliff_once_watched_a_space_shuttle_launch/,4,https://redd.it/93cch1,sloan_fitch,Cliff Once Watched a Space Shuttle Launch,"This memory from his youth stuck with him straight through the days that opiates hijacked his physiology and psyche. As many here are already aware, as he got more dependent some of his worst traits became amplified. Laziness, moochiness and dishonesty in collusion to drive away other productive human individuals. His laziness tied into his slovenly attitudes towards housekeeping and hygiene. This of course helped in the creation of the environment which is well suited to support a thriving bed bug population.


&nbsp;


Bed Bugs from space, who parked their damaged ship in high orbit used a landing pod to enter Earth's atmosphere. They actually made their way into Cliff's home via a case of Twinkies. Who would've thought? When the first space bed bugs began biting - they employed an ability which was unique to their race. This allowed them to establish an electrochemical connection via the blood and nerve fibers and in effect allowed them to form a connection with Cliff's mind. They scanned or detected memory fragments of life experiences that left an indelible impression, and the launch of the American Space Shuttle was one of them.


&nbsp;



The Space Shuttle is no more, while Orion and SLS are behind schedule. There's no way the current mass of bedbugs would be able to board any rocket in their entirety. That's okay, they can do it in small groups. However, the Russian Soyuz rocket is not an option. The Russians don't tolerate bullshit. Though consideration has been given to sneaking aboard in a box of cigars it turns out the Russians stopped smoking Cigars in space when they stopped operating their own space station Mir.


&nbsp;


Eventually, the mass of alien bed bugs which form Cliff did manage to make aboard a rocket. When word got out that Elon Musk might be sending a car to space, the bugs seized upon this opportunity and formed a plan. A small group of bugs managed to stuff themselves within folded sheets of paper in an envelope containing a U-Line catalogue. This was shipped to a the Teasla Motors manufacturing plant at which they in turn made their way into the upholstery of the Tesla Roadster that would ultimately be placed aboard the new Falcon Heavy rocket. 


&nbsp;


Little did the central mass which currently forms Cliff, nor did the bugs in the upholstry know until it was too late that car would not spend any time in Earth orbit. Nope, this car was sent on a trans-Martian trajectory. It would seem that nobody went out of their way to perform detailed calculations. It was expected that the car may go to Mars or that it may end up in the asteroid belt. Either way, this small group of bed bugs are not likely to be rejoined with members from the original mass of bed bugs that are working to hold the shape of Cliff as they swarm beneath his clothing.



&nbsp;



Will they break away group of bugs make it to Mars or the asteroid belt? Will the central mass of alien bed bugs send more members to hitch a ride on a future SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule? Perhaps they will wait for the Crew Dragon variant to become operational so that they'll have access to upholstery and warm bodies.


These and many more questions will be answered in the continuing saga of the alien bed bugs which have chosen Cliff as their host.",1533021807.0

I knew that much.,"My sister told me to meet her at McDonald’s.  Gabriella needed to call her guy back to tell him where to meet.  I specifically told Gabriella that since we were meeting my sister and her husband and my niece at McDonald’s, she needed to tell him somewhere close by but not there.  It was not something my sister and her husband needed to see, but after all that, she got off the phone and said,

“Okay.”

“Okay, what?”

“Okay. We’re meeting him at McDonald’s.”

I shook my head.  On the ride to McDonald’s and that entire morning, now that I think about it, she was the nicest she’d ever been to me and the calmest I’d ever seen her, except our first day and a half together.  My sister and her husband were already parked and leaning into the back of their car to get my niece out when we showed up.  I turned to Gabriella.

“Listen, this is my family.  I don’t want my sister finding out that we’re picking up here, too.  She thinks I’m sober.”

“Okay.”  Gabriella said.

“So, when your guy gets here, if he parks where we can see him, walk outside and get him to go to the other side of the parking lot. Do you understand?  Please, baby, I’m begging you.”

“Of course, Clyde.  It’s not even something you need to say.  I would never let your sister find out we were copping dope here or that we were getting high.”

“Good.  Here’s a hundred.”

I parked next to my sister.  We got out and said hello.  Gabriella introduced herself. 

My red-faced brother-in-law said, “I’m George.  This is Tammy, my wife and this sleeping beauty is Josephine.”  He was very proud and used his head to indicate my niece still sleeping in her car seat.  I was happy that he’d introduced himself to Gabriella because I had forgotten his name.  We walked inside.  

My brother-in-law ordered, and my sister picked a table over in the corner next to the window right by the cars.  The child was still sleeping, but once the food came, baby Josephine woke up.  About six months had passed since I first saw the baby, or so my sister determined while we talked about it.  

The first time I met her was in my aunt’s kitchen. My sister and brother-in-law handed me what I thought was a few pounds of hamburger meat that they’d put in a weird towel for some reason, but then it started whining and moving.  That had been my niece.  Now, that chunk of ground up beef had turned into a very belligerent and selfish miniature monkey.  The child threw tantrums.  She took food out of George’s mouth and threw it on the floor.  Cute little baby Josephine pulled a tray of two drinks off the table and onto the floor and laughed.  I watched horrified, and at that moment, a busted, burgundy Oldsmobile with tinted windows parked and bumped bass directly outside of the window from us.

My sister and George sneered at the car and its music.  Gabriella stood up.  She walked outside and jumped right into the passenger seat for less than a minute and jumped out right in front of us.  My sister and brother-in-law were incredulous.  Gabriella walked directly to the bathroom, and my sister turned to look at me.  I expected to see hurt.  I expected to see great disappointment, but she just kept trying to act like Gabriella wasn’t scoring and running to the bathroom to get high.  George took my niece in his arms to see the pretty colors of the inside playground, even if she was too young to play.  

“So, you’re leaving again?”  My sister tried to play it cool.  She looked down and sighed.  She tore the paper straw wrapper into bits of nothing.  When she looked up her brown eyes were wet and swollen.  “You don’t want to stay?”  

There was nothing for me to say.  I couldn’t stay.  She wasn’t like me, though.  Our childhoods would be forever bound by their brokenness and heartbreak, but unlike her, it had only made me calloused and ruthless.  I had become someone else.  She’d remained the innocent child.  She’d waited here for the remains of her family to be restored and happy again.  When she saw me at our aunt’s house, I was home from the streets after all those years of no communication and her wondering.  It had given life to those dreams of hers.  Our mother was dead.  Dad was in prison.  I was leaving again, and I might never see her again.  

You see?  I had become everything that I hated about my father.  That’s why they called me Boom Boom.  It was never Clyde doing those things.  Clyde couldn’t knock anyone out.  Clyde didn’t have the nerve to rip an eyeball out of a socket or collect debts for Jimbo and Fin or do the Faceless One’s dirt on the streets.  No.  Clyde had gotten lost somewhere under the persona and violence and the drugs a long time ago, and if ever he did show up, he was weak and confused and atrophied.  He couldn’t even stand up to himself and his addiction.  He couldn’t stand up to our Dad.  He couldn’t stand up to Gabriella.  All he could do was hide and let the monster living within himself handle his affairs.  And that was never pretty.

Now, though, my sister excused herself.  She walked quickly towards the bathroom, which Gabriella hadn’t exited yet.  She was trying to find a vein or nodded.  I knew that much.  My sister would have to wonder what was wrong.  George walked over to me with the baby.  We talked a minute, before my sister came back to the table.

“Your girlfriend is standing in the middle of the bathroom.  There’s blood all over the floor!  I picked up a needle and threw it in the garbage.”  I looked up from talking to George.  My sister continued.  “She’s out of it, Clyde, and that woman right there saw it.”  My sister pointed to a well-dressed woman in fine black clothing and expensive jewelry.  The woman was waiting at the front counter for management.  I kissed my sister on the cheek.

“See ya, Tammy.  I gotta go.  Bye George.”

I ran to the women’s bathroom.  Gabriella was in her typical nodded stance.  I threw her over my shoulder and ran through the lobby to the car.  Her head got banged up as I shoved her into the front seat.  I never looked back.

*So much for not letting my sister find out we were scoring or getting high.*  I thought as we got onto the highway and headed south towards Kentucky.  But then, another voice spoke up in there.  It asked me where Boom Boom was.         ",1533009039.0

About 90 seconds into this .2ish shot my bells are ringing like I just shot crack. I’m drenched in sweat, and my vision is going blurry. I’m feeling like I’m falling through a tunnel, and when I reach then end I puke up whatever the dope doesn’t want in my system. It was fucking amazing. 

This was 8 hours ago, and I’m still feeling good. 

I was a little bummed hearing that a half G was going to be $60, since I’m use to getting 3gs for $100; but I could easily use all 3gs in a day. Whereas I’ve barely touched this half and still feel great. 

There are pros and cons to the dope on the opposite coasts. The grass is always greener, and that sort of thing. It’s just been a nice first day back in the state of my origin, and I thought I would share.

Been in the hospital since early Sunday morning. My lungs started hurting, I kept smoking, then lungs started to close up a bit, kept smoking. Got an inhaler, helped about 10%. Success! Kept smoking.


I ended up nodding out Sunday night not really breathing right. Had been up for a few days at that point so I thought a little break and some sleep would fix me right up. [There's more to this that I added to a comment below, if interested.](http://reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/93alqe/in_the_hospital_dont_keep_smoking_when_your_lungs/e3c15hg)

Woke up a few hours later, couldn't breathe at all. Felt like I was only getting air into the top two inches of my lungs... Lips were blue, couldn't really talk.

Checked into ER. Was getting under 70% oxygen. 

I'm getting steroids, albuterol and a shit ton of xanax. Was oxygen for a couple days and now I'm getting 95% all by myself!

Sitting in my kitchen, sipping my coffee when Cliff messaged me on AIM and by AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) I mean whatever the kids are using for instant messaging today - just don't want to specify what platform hence the smokescreen imposed by using *old* web nomenclature.


First it came up as a notification on my laptop screen, but I took care to respond on my phone in case he wanted to come to my house. I wanted to be able to pretend to be at work if it necessary. The fact I was responding from my mobile device would be indicated on his end if he was paying attention to such a detail.


&nbsp;


Anyway, I'm sure you can imagine. He had called me and left a comical message a couple of days prior in what sounded like a bartarded stupor, though it could have been his chronic opioid induced speech pattern. He joked about massacring my family and my turtles if I didn't call back by midnight. I know it sounds fucked up but this is one thing I actually can understand and be fine with - saying outrageous shit for the sake of humor. I know he's not going to torch my turtle and if he did she'd go under water. 



To the point, when he called he said there was an emergency of epic proportions. No detail. Someone in this community speculated that his emergency was that he had no one else to take advantage of on that day.


&nbsp;


For ~~today's~~ Sunday's IM (instant message) conversation it went as follows...



**Cliff:** You alive man ??



**Cliff:** I haven't heard or sen from you in 4ever.



**Me:** Yes, and you? I've just been focusing on keeping my nose clean. You know the first few weeks can be especially challenging for some.




**Cliff:** yes, of course and u also know that I'D NEVER tempt ya if u r going on the straight and arrow.



**Cliff:** but anyways how have you been?



**Me:** Been writing a lot, racking up miles on my bike and continuing to change out and upgrade it's components.



**Me:** Also been presented with another job opportunity from *mutual friend x*.



**Cliff:** that's all, no time to hang out anymore?



**Me:** Like I said, keeping my nose clean. I know you have no wish or intention to derail my recovery but I certainly can slip up quite easily through this critical stage before I can confidently put my self int he line of... lines lol



**Cliff:** I understand but I feel like I lost one of my good friends



**Cliff:** When I did nothing wrong



&nbsp;


He then sent a text message to my phone through a web browser based text messaging service as a test. Thus we can infer that his cell phone service is turned off but he still has internet access for the moment. So come pay day, this is how he'll contact his middle or his plug if they don't answer the phone. The events of this post actually happened two days ago. Later in the day Cliff did call me from his house phone and I didn't answer. 


&nbsp;


Cliff also called me from his house phone while I was at work yesterday. I accidentally texted him saying I worked until 8pm. I meant to text that to another person but that's okay because I wasn't going to be at home after work anyway. Cliff didn't text back (IM not phone) or leave voice message. So I have no idea aside from our conversation through AIM on Sunday why he was calling me.


&nbsp;


I can only speculate what he's calling me on the phone about. Maybe his mom's heart medication is ready for pick-up and since Cliff doesn't have money for a cab he needs to send someone else. In this speculative situation, he can't send Derrick to pick it up because junkies usually don't accept heart medication in place of oxy. It's on the way home from work for me so it should be no trouble is what Cliff would be thinking when asking me. One would think this would be an easy thing to ask by text. Then again, it's harder to say no and easier for someone like Cliff to get what they want through persistence in a phone call. 


I don't really know and I don't want to find out either way if it requires my physical presence or a verbal phone conversation.



&nbsp;


#A Little Dissection



Regarding our web based instant message conversation, I'd like to dissect it a little bit for fun. 



First in order of where it occurred in the convo: ""**I feel like I lost one of my good friends**"", ""when I did nothing wrong.""



Maybe he genuine feels this way, I think he is almost certainly lonely. He screwed over a number of people to get to this point, I was among a handful who gave him innumerable chances to play his games. Nobody gave him an extra chance hoping to get screwed. I say a small handful because most outside that small sub-group only ever gave him a single chance to fuck them over. Whereas I, or his brother for example gave him more slack. By doing so we inadvertently sent the message that he could it again with no major consequence.



Point is, by mixing friendhsip, business and the game together he alienated one of his ""good friends."" I'm not saying those things can't be mixed, but the way Cliff conducts such activities causes the current outcome to be quite inevitable.


&nbsp;

#""When I did nothing wrong""


The second part of the previously quoted sentence about losing a good friend, he added that and asserted, **""when I did nothing wrong""**


Of course I screamed BUSLLSHIT to myself, but didn't see a point in arguing this assetion with him. I doubt I'd get him to agree, and if he did indicate he agreed it would only be so that he could ask me to do something. An empty apology just so that the conversation can move forward and he could obtain something he needs.


That's speculative as well, but a reasonable hypothesis.

&nbsp;




To be fair, in the past when I've felt like I was wronged by Cliff there were times that it was a legit supply line issue. However, I often couldn't tell if he was bullshitting me or if we were just victims of outside factors.


&nbsp;

It got under my skin, I reflect a little bit and although I might've simply hashed this out while talking to myself during a bike ride - I thought it to be safer to share it here beacuse I have a long bike ride ahead of me which will bring me to some of the more hazardous routes. Thus in the name of bicycle safety, I present it here.

#The Innumerable Theses


* That time I paid for a bun and got scraps and lies while waiting for the rest to be delivered.


* The time he buttered me up to give him my last $200 to put towards bulk subs that never appeared. 


* Those couple of times where I paid a little bit for a share in a larger order and waited nearly a week for delivery because his dboy/middle got pulled over. In the mean time we had to wait for his dboy to recoup his losses. Thanks to a new program in our city, instead of arresting the dboy the cops simply confiscated the dope and gave him a desk appearance ticket. 


* That time his dboy delivered for the last time - it was fake dope. I know it was because a week earlier Cliff and Ben paid the dboy with a fake hundred dollar bill. He caught it right away but was cool about it...  It my opinion it was not a coincidence that the same guy delivered fake dope a week later. Cliff took care of me on script day which I'd say is actually a positive until we think of the implication on the next point.




* His sister (they don't get along) screwed me out of $60. I basically got 2 subs for $80. Cliff put up half the money. In fact, first he had my $40 and I had to fucking negotiate to get MY money back. Then he wanted subs too so he sent me to the ATM at 3AM with his card in order to add to the order. After paying his sister and getting nothing more than the initial two at the beginning of the weekend, we were both at a loss.                          



 In a bartarded state of mind Cliff **gave me an ultimatum to pay him back within a day**. To which I vehemently disagreed because I've been made to wait a week for pay back from him during circumstances that may not have been in his control. In this case, it was definitely not my fault so I felt that I should at least have equal courteousy extended to me that I have for him innumerable times prior.



 I paid him back, but most certainly did not do it within 24 hours per his ultimatum. totally got under my skin that he felt such a double-standsrd to be appropriate. This left another indelible mark.




* I also witnessed him plotting to screw others, things like ""I'm holding two buns for Dack to pick up tomorrow, I'm thinking about doing half a bun and telling him I was shorted and that I'll pay him back on script day."" I suspect that he would have similar conversations with others if I wasn't his only actual friend and at the very least such was an indispensable part of his thought process.


&nbsp;


After each time he caused me to lose money he always paid me back in pills or dope. In times where I was gonna buy either anyway this was fine and fair aside from being super rude and inconvenient. Truly so, it was often like being tricked into loaning someone moeny for a week or two in when I had no intention or plans to be without the money for more than a day or two.

#Why this post? 


Surely some are thinking ""this again?"" Others might enjoy the enterinment value, the deep analysis and the pactical educational value contained therein. However for me, I just wanted to compile as many reasons as I could remember. These are reasons as to why I should not feel conflicted about denying someone who refers to me as a ""good friend"" the opportunity to be graced with my presence. All of the game related stuff is more than enough to remind me.


&nbsp;

If all that wasn't enough, which it is then I have a couple of more points to remind myself. Hanging out with Cliff even if there was a guarantee that he wasn't a bad influence, even if he never asked to borrow any moeny, resources, if he wasn't a mooch...


His house is a bio-hazard. He's a bio-hazard. If he enters my house I could have bed bugs again, it wasn't too long ago that I had just got that shit under control after the second wave which he precipitated by providing transportation to a bed bug army. 


&nbsp;


#All that shit aside, it's just weird hanging with him. 



He's the kind of the person who will ask you to get him a can of soda from the fridge when we're both sitting down because you're closer to the fridge. 



The kind of person who used to get me to walk his dog and when I stopped falling for that bullshit he used pills and dope to get me to do it until my tolerance increased and I was buying my own dope.



The kind of person who asks where you going when you see him outside and uses it as a chance to get a favor. Like if I was taking a simple leisurely ten mile bike ride, he'd hand me his debit card to get a cople of bottls of soda, because ""it's on the way back."" Then a number of times I'd find out his debit card didn't have funds on it so I end up looking like a broke and disorganized jerk-off at the ckeck-out counter. Diddo to those times he gave me shopping list of donuts and junk food. 

&nbsp;


Then there's the really weird stuff, like how he'd often get me to hang out a little later than I wanted to, Thus interfering with my workout routine, thereby contributing to my loss of muscle mass. Maybe he was lonely and people being a lonely does garner my empathy but I think routine was more important to him. Every day since he broke his TV, he needed to move his TV from his living room to his bed room. He always preferred having help doing that before bed so if I wanted to leave too soon he'd be like ""this movie ends in 20 minutes, please stick around ane help me move my TV"" or ""you said you'd stay til the end of the movie."" 


&nbsp;


Point is, it was his irresponsible behavior that broke his TV. Any TV he broke was basically his fault. Now that I think about it, this will get a post of it's own. For now, I'm going to stop here. I have to send a real friend my resume because I was informed yesterday about a potentially lucrative job opportunity.

Problem is, it doesnt kill pain anymore, it just gets me high.

i take 0.5mg/day (1/2 mg)

my doctor was telling me about how he had a patient whom uses the Actiq Lozenges for their migraines

Not only do i have severe migraines, i have severe TMJ / Neuralgia, and fibromyalgia, among other things

When these two combine, its like im dying

I have tried Tramadol concurrently , i have tried lyrica, neuronton and every muscle relaxer

Tramadol works but only if i take a half tablet before i take a suboxone and a half tablet after . a full 50mg makes me dizzy, even if i take it by itself with no bupe.

My doctor doesnt give a shit if i take an opiate for severe pain . 

The problem is now , ive been feeling a lot better, and i havent got my MRIs done, so my main doctor, who prescribed the Tramadol, wont see me until i get the MRIs, which will most likely show nothing . 

Like i said, ive been feeling a little better lately, so this is my time to get some stuff done, not go to MRI appointments, i run a business, and i have things to do that ive waited 7 months for.

After I get my MRIs completed, what is the best way to bring up Actiq lozenge to my doctor? Tramadol makes me feel ill. shakey, and shit.

Id really like to try a low dose actiq lozenge OR maybe tapentadol . 
(taptentadol should be able to be taken concurrently with suboxone as it inhibits the general same pathways as tramadol)

as far as medications go , the only thing that helps me is tylenol and its tearing a hole in my stomach. virtually everything ive tried sucks balls, either doesnt work or makes me zombified.

id also like to get ketamine for pain . try it rather.. but we know that ain gonn happen

What are your suggestions on how to speak to my doctor about switching my Tramadol to a more powerful pain med like Actiq or Tapentadol?

More than likely i could get something like abuse proof hydromorphone or abuse proof something else... but i think he thinks i am a drug addict, yet still gave the tramadol. i hope he doesnt hate me because i have not done the MRIs yet  . id like to do a stand-up one.

I have a 5.5 mg patch, so 100 ml would make it 55ug per 1 ml dose. Im thinkin Id be more comfortable with 200 ml or even 250 ml so a 1ml dose would be ~25-20 ug. 


Regardless it will still come off weaker than what is in the actual patch, Im expecting a 60% extraction, but will treat it as 100% extraction as a precaution. 


Can plain water be used for this? Or do I need a saline solution? Or even alcohol? Id prefer not to use any sort of rubbing alcohol, or alcohol in general as I plan on consuming the final product (obviously lol). But im thinking it would have to be like, extracted with rubbing alcohol, evaporate the alcohol, take the “powder” or whatevers left over, and add to a solution.

I haven’t done ket before but I’ve been on a hectic blackout bender this weekend and woke up with a fat bag of drugs, not sure what combinations to try. K + Oxy seemed like a good time because I’ve really been enjoying my oxy and from what I’ve read about ketamine i’ll hopefully quite like that too, but I’ve never really done dissociatives at all. Oxy is quickly becoming my drug of choice so I’d like my next high to include it if possible, which is why I’m posting here instead of just on r/drugs or something. 

If anyone has any suggestions for a top quality time I have: 

2mg xanax (never tried)

9g weed (used about 3 times)

15mg valium (first time was this weekend and don’t really remember the high at all)

160mg oxycontin (infrequent user, 4th time was tonight)

250mg MDMA (tried once but don’t think I got high)

400mg ketamine (never tried)

Also have some tobacco and could probably get some alcohol if need be. I can also get some dihydrocodeine cough syrup and maybe nangs too, but I haven’t bought a cracker yet so only if it’s for something to *really* get me fucked up. 

For reference I will likely be doing everything alone 🙁 so nothing suuuuuuper dangerous, obviously drug use is never going to be 100% safe but I don’t want to take any excessive risks as there won’t be anyone to help me out if things go really bad. 

Apologies if this is an odd request, but I’d love any recommendations you guys might have, especially if it’s along the lines of “x + y is shitty don’t do it”.  

Unfortunately I can’t talk to my boyfriend about this and the only other person I know that does more than weed is my dealer and I don’t really wanna embarrass myself with my inexperience, so dosage advice would be amazing too please!

It might sound crazy, but a part of me actually enjoys it, if I'm being honest. I think its because it feels great when your able to scratch it?.

Btw....with how much everyone loves pictures I'll post a couple when it looked the worst. But one thing to keep in mind, it bruising throughout the area, but that's not from the abscess or miss.

As I said, I felt in love. Wanted to know every fucking thing about this substance, it was so fascinating! At this time I wasn't a full time user, and live was pretty good at this point. I really wanted to be in this shit, what is stupid. I tried everything, from Codeine to Heroin. I bought 1g of some #4 and began to smoke. This was the biggest mistake i've ever did. I got addicted. Not physical, but mental. So I tried to chase that feeling, again and again. That I got physical addicted too.

Yey. 3 days ago I ran out of pills, and I couldn't contanct my plug. I went to the town to pick up some pills. Bought them at least from my alcoholic ex girlfriend (this lady steals from old people the meds, such a awful person). I bought totally overpriced tilidine 100mg tabs. I was really ashamed, took the next bus home, crushed up 10 of this fuckers and mixed it with a pepsi. As I stared on that bottle of pepsi, with this huge amout of pills in it, I cried.

As of last week he said he would usually be carrying a few gs to sell daily as before he'd grab cash from me upfront then pickup and deliver my shit.

Today he didnt have any and was going to reup but wanted my cash upfront to get for me.  He also middles for other people and in the past would collect peoples cash upfront to get a good amount to allow himself to get in on the pickup without having to throw any money in.  So everyone got what they paid for but since a decent amount was purchased and he got it for cheaper buying in bulk he was able to get some for free....or basically his portion for middlng and taking all the risk.

Ive never had any issues with him getting my cash upfront except sometimes hes taken all day or days a few times to deliver.  Id rather not do it that way but he was my only hookup for black until recently so that's the only way i could get any ...again this is the only source i had until recently when i found a few new connects.

So he hits me back around 2pm today saying he needs cash first to grab and i said ok come by to get it.  He says he will be by soon.  I ask if i could roll with....no response.....i ask a little while later if he still coming....no response....so after like 4 hours or so my newer connect who always has and doesnt middle hits me up asking if i need.  It being awhile since my middle last responded i wasnt sure what was up so i hit my new connect back saying ""ya i need"" and rolled by him and grabbed my shit quick and easy no delays.

So right after i did that of course my middle hits me back which was after like 4 hours saying he sorry for lagging and hes at my place.  He doesnt live far from me btw.  So i was a little irratated that he was MIA the whole time and didnt respond so i didnt get back to him.  Now kno that hes lagged like crazy sometimes when hes got my cash and went missing and given me excuse after excuse to why hes taking so long or not even showed up in the first place as cause for delay in delivery so im to the point where im ready to cut ties with him but since he started middling for me we've kinda become cool i guess and i still use him cuz he does deliver and that is huge for me since i don't always have transportation to get to my new connects.

So my middle blows up my phone calling like 20 times over a few min period and sends a crazy amount of texts like ""where the fuck are you""....""you fucked me by not answering""....""johnny_cockring how can you do this to me???""....""i came all the way to your house"" (even tho i live a few miles away)....and so on.  So i havent responded and am really turned off by the whole situation cuz dude doesnt get back to me and just expects me to wait around when i had no idea what was going down after we last talked cuz he took forever to get back to me and then blows me up and I wasnt sure if he was still coming or what.  

So am i the one who fucked up cuz i didnt wanna wait and took advantage of having a ride when i dont usually have one to my other reliable dudes to pickup instead of waiting for my middle whos been known to take forever and didnt update me on when he would be by after i texted him and called him to see what was up and got no response.  After like 4 or so hours did he finally get back to me but i already lined something else up cuz i didnt wanna lose out if he bailed or didnt show up which coulda been a possibility with his track record of delivering.  So whatcha all think?  Im seriously just considering cuttin homeboy out due to all this hoopla and dont need the drama.

Well that is all....please feel free all to lemme know if i fucked up or am ok for feelin off by this whole mess.

Tldr: hit my middle up earlier to get me some black said he would come by soon to get my cash ended up taking forever to respond and come by my place (4+ hours actually) and by that time i picked up from my other dude and middle got pissed cuz  i didnt respond to him after he finally showed up and got back to me.",1532943467.0

It's 4am here and just did my like 7th shot of the night and about to go to bed. I'm sure everyone here can relate to the enjoyable feeling that happens when combining opiates and nicotine. They synergize really well. I usually do this with cigarettes. Smoking cigs definitely makes me nod harder.

Now I own a suorin, which I purchased sort of recently. It is like a juul with 50mg nic salts... when I hit it after getting high I feel like it makes my high stronger, however the noddiness isn't as intense and instead I feel more awake and alert. This isn't necessarily bad, but my addictive/compulsive behavior makes it easier for me to do more dope. Does anyone relate or know what I'm talking about? It's like the nicotine from the vape, since it's in much higher quantity of nicotine I'm guessing is giving me a different buzz as oppose to when I smoke a cigarette.

Ocs are more potent than morphine, right? so how much of IV morphine is equal to IV oxy, I have the 30mg morph pills, they are ER, and have the little beads inside the cap.

I shot over 400-450mg of morph daily, and I have 330mg and this 15mg oxys, I will divide my doses and try to be good. Should I just eat the damn oxy and shot just the morphine? or should I prep a morph+oxy shot, and how to prep it?

Been lurking on this sub for years now on my main. Some time ago I created an alt and was posting here somewhat frequently, and boy has a lot happened since then! I quit using my alt and went to rehab to get sober for a few months, got a job offer across the country, relapsed, moved to take the job, and now I've been here working and trying to maintain a habit ever since. I will say that I like the price of tar, and it feels more mellow and safer compared to ECP, but boy do I miss the heavy nods and amazing rush from a fat shot of #4! ODing really sucked though and I dont really worry about that with tar. I usually get tar that i would say is about 9/10 as far as tar goes and some coke thats more like 8/10. I would estimate that I would have to shoot roughly twice the amount of tar to get similar effects to the #4 I was getting back home. And I cant afford a habit large enough to allow me to OD. Idk if the high is just more subtle or if my body is just better attenuated to DAM than MAM. I've considered trying to extract and separate the DAM and MAM from my stuff to compare, but I think that's more trouble than it's really worth..

Anyways, the coke plug is a new thing I've only had for a few weeks (after 18 months without) so naturally I've been shooting speedballs like crazy recently. I've noticed something peculiar about speedballs with tar and I wanted to see how anyone's observations compare with mine. When mixing the two in the syringe cap I've noticed that with *really* good tar the solution will fizz and bubble when the coke is added, almost like when you add citric acid to freebase coke. Except this isn't freebase coke. And if I happen to cop some less than average dope, then it doesn't really make the coke solution bubble up that much. I've also noticed that when I shoot the coke by itself, the rush isn't nearly what it is compared to when I add even the smallest amount of tar. Perhaps it's related to the fact that heroin imitates dopamine while cocaine causes the brain to be flooded with it and prevent its reuptake? So if my brain is already drained of natural dopamine then adding cocaine wont have much effect since theres not much to flood the brain with; but if heroin is added, the heroin acts to replace all the missing dopamine through imitation, and the cocaine acts to prevent its reuptake, which would normally happen very quickly. So the drugs combined work synergistically and produce a stronger effect than either alone. Sounds plausible but biochemistry was always my least favorite subject.

We (Partner in Crime & I) had some subs but of course wanted to get dope if at all possible so were putting off taking any.

Sold $40 worth of subs in the morning, and some friends had promised the previous day to give us a ride to the bus stop that's closer to the city, because the bus only runs twice a day here on Sundays. Unfortunately, they weren't answering so we were feeling pretty shitty.

Then a miracle happened: I put a $300 item on craigslist like two months ago, and the other day someone hit me up about meeting up for it today. I had gotten contacted by so many bots, scammers, and flakes, I didn't think much of it, but this afternoon the dude actually hit me up, came through and gave me $250 cash! We now had close to $300! AND our ride got back to us immediately after that!

Went and got a healthy amount of dope, a couple bags of powder, and 4 footballs, with plenty of money left over to go back tomorrow as well as buy some food and a couple other things I've been wanting. We were kinda harassed/physically assaulted by some punk ass juveniles in the city which was kinda ass, but I let it roll off my back. I told the dudes on the set and they went off looking for the kids lol, can't have people scaring your customers off.

 The goal would be to sense an overdose using biometrics and either create a sound alert to try to get the person aware again, a message alert using one of the wireless or GSM peripherals or perhaps ultimately administer a narcan nasal spray. The sensors I have found that could measure these are as follows: pulse sensor, temperature sensor (placed under nose for breath) or alternately thermistor sensor which would be smaller but achieve the same result, accelerometer for chest movement or alternately inertial measurement unit (IMU) for the same application, flexible band belt respiration sensor/Fabric stretch sensor, sound sensor to listen for breathing, IR sensor (to measure heart beats), pressure sensor for respiration. 

I have no idea which would be best alone or combined to get the most accurate idea if someone is slipping into an overdose or has already overdosed. I do see projects people have done in the past that do similar things measuring breathing or pulse such as [this one] (http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/f2012/htq2_mg573/htq2_mg573/index.htm) 
made by people at Cornell so some smart mofos. Their device uses a thermistor sensor and has a buzzer when breathing rate gets too low and a different sound when breathing stops. 

My goal would ultimately be to have some sort of beeping if breathing gets too slow to give the person a chance to wake up and if breathing got way too slow or stopped it would somehow activate a nasal spray of narcan. I don't know if this is possible or perhaps too ambitious trying to administer narcan but at the very least there could be a noise to alert family or roommates or even a prerecorded message calling 911 using the GSM board (911 is free to call too so there wouldn't even be any need to put minutes on the SIM). 

I have had this idea in my head for ages and just got into Arduino's and saw potential to turn this idea into a reality. The device being open source means anyone could get the parts and make it themselves and even if it needed to be sold it could be made very compact with some of the arduino boards and could be as low of a price as 40 bucks as that is what the Cornell students project costs as a one off. 

Please critique the hell out of the idea, tell me if anyone would actually even use it, if you'd be afraid of it malfunctioning and narcaning you when your not ODing (my biggest worry) or it failing and not saving you putting myself at liability (would need to consult lawyers on that one, maybe make it a kit and not even sell it as a narcan dispenser). What you think about if its possible to even code something like this for all you coders, help writing the code if anyone is actually interested and passionate about the project, possible sensor combos that would ensure no accidental narcaning. Any input would help me so much as this has been something I have been building in my head for years and want to see it actually happen if I can. Thanks in advance.

So today a good friend of mine called me early in the morning with some exciting news. He had gotten ahold of an m-box 30 and had a leftover 602 script and asked if he could swing by and nod out to some cartoons and pizza. I had been on my regular opioid abstination period for a while and therefore I decided ""what the heck, it's Sunday"" and told him to come over. So he swings by and we decided to order some carry-out from a local pizza joint before we'd start kicking it and buy some cigs to really get the full effect. On our way there we each took 7.5mg/480mg of oxy/apap to get things started. We arrive there, paid for the pizza, took it to the car and smoked a couple cigs on the parking lot. We were already feeling it. 

 He spontaneously takes out the m-box and crushes it on his phone with a lighter and good old Andrew Jackson. I was like: ""bro, I thought we were gonna sniff back home"", he then said: ""let's just do a line each and take the rest of the endos in yo house"", I said ""cool"". He took Andrew off the crushed remains of the m-box, I noticed it had a bright blue color, but I had never had an m-box before and thought little of it. I ripped half the pill and guided it safely through my nose and into my oxygen sacks and shortly after we were headed our way. All my insides felt warm and comfy. But, I noticed it came up ALOT faster and harder than other oxy 30's. I was almost noddin' the fuck out in less than 5 minutes of insufflation, but I thought little of this. 

After a couple of blocks, my buddy stops near the sidewalk and told me he's noddin' hard and asks me if I could drive. I get out he car and went around to get in the driver's seat and I was thinking to myself: ""how in the fuck are we going to get home"" but I'd rather drive than let my friend because he really was kicking it. It took him a minute or two to get out because he was soo out of it; then and there I realized something was off. I got in the driver's seat, he got in and we left. Not even 5 minutes after we leave, this nigga passed out in the seat and I started freaking out. I was like: ""Bro! Bro! Get up!! Yo, common you gotta get up!"". He wasn't responding. His skin turned as pale as snow and his lips and fingers blue. He shortly after had lapses where he stopped breathing. I was crying and trying to keep his head straight and gave him a half-assed cpr which seemed to work, all while driving and trying to fight the nod to get some help for him. I really thought I had lost him a couple times on the way home. Never had I felt such dread in my life.

 I FINALLY get home and I went to grab my phone to call the ambulance but I couldn't find it. I freaked out a little bit, and stopped a lady and asked her if she could call 911 because my friend wasn't responding. She called an ambulance and they were on their way. I was trying to keep my friend alive by continuing cpr and this lady starts asking questions. And she's saying: did you take drugs? You look like you take drugs. Is he on heroin?, I said ""I don't know lady, he just went out and I'm very worried, thanks for your help but can you leave me alone?""; this moment right here she went from ""nice"" to being a massive huge cunt and starts blabbering: ""You little shit! If it weren't for me he would die! You want me to leave? Because I'll leave and let him die! And I said ""look lady get the fuck out of here if you want, I dont need your shit right now. 

By this point my landlord had come out and had grasped the situation. I then see Ms. Bitchface headed straight to him and I could just feel the shittalking going down over there. While she was telling my landlord all sorts of stupid bullshit, I was still trying to get my friend up. I gently slapped him in the face and shook him a little bit to get him up. My biggest concern was him choking on his own vomit so I just kept his head straight. And right before the ambulance got there, he started getting up. I felt sooo relieved. He was conscious again and when the ambulance arrived they took some vitals and asked what happened. My friend being a smug motherfucker he told them he just had a low blood sugar and passed out. They asked if he had used any drugs and he just denied it. Apparently they bought into it and they finally asked if he wanted to go to a hospital but he said no, that he'd just eat something and be alright. 

After all of this had happened I thanked the universe for not letting my buddy go. I was in awe and I will never take him for granted again. We nodded out for the rest of the day and now he's almost completly sober and back at his house. It was a wild-ass ride.  

Please please please test your shit before you use it. I learned today the hard way and it could have went so much worse, I'm just glad he was able to push through an overdose unscathed and I still can't believe how I even managed to get home safely and kept it cool in front the EMTs or the cops. 

Tl;Dr: Friend calls me, says he has some endos and and m-box. Turned out m-box was pressed w/fent but realized when it was too late. Friend almost died, but turned out ok.

Since that Friday & Saturday night debacle I havent heard of more ODs but whatever.

A quick google search will bring up the article which will explain in more details about what happened and the exact stamp which caused everything.

In general though the stamp is from a block which is one of the few ""heroin"", or at least heroin and fent mixed bags left. Most of the corners down in Kensington sell bags of fent & fent/heroin bags. Of course there are likely more heroin only stamps down there, but just stating from experience. I am a fentanyl user personally so I am not really sure.

Anyway, basically from what the articles have stated and from first hand reports of people I know, after people IVed or snorted the bags they got a scary and completely shocking reaction. The dude I spoke to ended up laying down and almost seizing up. He said he was basically hallucinating. He also kind of fell out like a normal high dosed fent IV. Paramedics reported that when people were given narcan they became completely shocked along with other abnormal reactions. I forget all the reported symptoms from the articles I read just that they were really nuts.

The bags were sent out to be tested and just recently they came back. The bags included heroin and fentanyl. They also included synthetic marijuana!

As somebody who only has experience smoking normal weed and hates it because of bad side effects such as paranoia, shortness of breath, chest pounding, and depression I cant imagine what these people went through.

On top of that it was synthetic marijuana not regular weed. Ive never smoked K2, but damn that freaks me out that some assholes cut the heroin with not only fentanyl, but this shit.

I havent seen any recent reports or talked to anyone down there that has said it is still out there. I have copped on blocks just next to that street and have gotten the same expected fentanyl.

Anyway, figured Id share this again because of how interesting and scary it is. Supposedly 100+ people were reported to have non fatal ODs stretching from Kenzo to Allentown, and that is just the reported cases. Im sure there were a lot more considering how popular I know that block is and the fact that it was the weekend.

One last tidbit. Basically the numbers were average for the amount of fatal ODs in the city. Most likely related to other bags.",1532918482.0

I'll try to keep it short. I've been using heroin for about 4 years now, however, a year ago I managed to quit(for the most part). Aside from a couple of slip ups, I've been sober until about 2 months ago.

 So i started using again, I live on the west coast so it's mainly black tar over here. My dealer told me he had some china white, which he admitted he didn't know what was in it and thought it was fent. I tried it(smoking) and just from 1 small hit I felt a pretty strong rush. So I've been using this stuff for about 1.5 months now, and it is STRONG. I haven't touched a needle in a year so I've just been smoking. So I'm 99% sure this stuff is fentanyl, it's strong as hell, doesn't last long, and definitely not as euphoric. I also get sick pretty quickly which sucks.

So I am asking you guys for help. I NEED to quit, I hate this stuff and I'm tired of this lifestyle and I'm furious at myself for throwing almost a year of relative sobriety away. I want to get clean forever. I've only been using this stuff for 1.5 months and I haven't touched a needle so I figure I can do this! I know it's only going to get harder to quit so I need to do this. So here's where I'm at:

I use about 0.2g of this china white fent a day. I have about 2 days worth of it left. I am going to continue doing what I do for the next 2 days then I am getting clean. I have 6 subutex pills(they're 8mg RP b8). I don't think I can get any more subs so this is what I have to work with(well and a lot of weed and wax) So how do I go about quitting with what I have? any help is much appreciated. I honestly have never used subs before so I have no idea what I am doing! ",1532917890.0

My plug said the dope was cheaper, stronger and lasted longer. I was always hesitant to go to heroin. A couple days ago I caved and bought my first bag. Got .6 grams for $20 as a first time buyer hook up. I’ll never shoot the dope but I’m planning on snorting it. My question is, how much should I sniff to get the high we all want based off my tolerance and prior opiate use? The dope isn’t the tar type, it’s a very powdery Brown substance.

I’m a very light dope user, once every couple moths I’ll buy a couple bags, it’s super hard for me to find. I’m mostly a pothead. I have two dry herb vaporizers, the VapCap M and the Fury 2. They heat up weed and you breathe/draw air thru it and out comes the vapor. The weed doesn’t get lit on fire, it’s just “cooked”. They vape at temperatures ranging from 320-430F. The Fury is battery powered and can be set to a specific temp, the vapcap is completely analog and requires a butane torch (most efficient). I’ve done many google and Reddit searches and couldn’t find any info about doing this. I really don’t want to waste any of the two bags I have by trying this, only to find out it doesn’t work. Does anyone know if you can vape ecp/#\4?

After jumping from anywhere between 150 to 300 mg / day of oxy, I waited until I was in full withdrawal cut off a fingernail size sliver of sub (probably .5 mgs), let it dissolve under my tongue. After waiting 45mins- hr I took another ~.5mg sliver which seemed to get me feeling “normal”. I then took a 2 mg bar of Xanax went to sleep and woke up the next day it was swollen and red face especially around my nose and my eyes. I rode out the rest of the withdrawals, being in a different country on vacation really seemed to help, especially when paws kicked in bc with a new adventure everyday, there was little time to sit around and dwell on everything that runs thru your head during paws. Anyway as soon as I returned home to nyc I relapsed (shocker). That was about 1.5 yrs ago. Now, after having 3 months clean from nov- end of January, I’m almost 8 months deep into daily use and back around 180mg/day, some days up to 240-300mgs. Need at least 150 to feel normal, plus 30mgs of adderall (especially during work week) or else I can’t even begin to do any work at all. Usually all snorted, sometimes I will eat them, but as you can imagine, this isn’t sustainable. The money isn’t even the main the catalyst behind my desire to quit. I am just so tired of this lifestyle and being a slave to the pill that I need to get off immediately. Anyone who has common experiences and can offer alternative methods or other insight it would be greatly appreciated. Also, between jumping and taking the subs, I took probably 8mg (4 - 2mg tablets) of loperamide - nothing excessive, just so I didn’t shit my pants constantly. Is it possible that little amount of lope could’ve triggered precipitated wd’s? I’d say my last “dose” of lope was maybe only 8 hours max before I took the first sliver of sub. ",1532912419.0

I once went on the roller coaster at Six Flags when I was in college and was traumatized for months (heart racing, sweating profusely just closing my eyes and imagining the first plunge).  This time around, I still spent half the time with my eyes closed at the kiddie rides.  I was visibly shaken getting off a ride my underlings thoroughly enjoyed.

I laugh when I imagine the sorts of risk I put myself through (od, heart infections, MRSA,...) , especially when I was shooting up multiple times a day for several months.  Yet, I was completely fearless during that whole process (even when I was messing with pure fent).   

I also have an intense fear of the death-like state you're in when doctors put you under general anesthesia, but of course, shooting up drugs is precisely the kind of activity that put you at risk for that kind of ""lights out, you're dead"" kind of death.

My sweet spot for ~2 years was 20mg of opana twice a day. Usually 7-12hr apart. I had a traumatic situation happen and my use for the first time in a decade of use, got out of control.

I started doing 40-60mg of opana, sometimes 80mg. Doing entire pills in one line. I even tried sniffing dope twice. After about 60 days of a huge increase in use it hit me that this was insane so I tried to taper. Here is what I did

80mg- day 1
60mg- day 2
10mg day 3 (where it really starts)
Day 4-Nothing but 15-16 grams of Kratom. A lot I know. I still felt bad as hell.
Day 5- 90mg Percocet
Day 6- 75mg percocet
Day 7- 60mg percocet
And here we are at day 8- I’ve done 30mg percocet at 10am and it’s 3pm and I still feel high? Like energy and all.

From here? I have access to 10mg of suboxone and ~150 grams of Kratom and plan to use that to taper for another 3-5 days. I appreciate all and any advice! Seriously!!

Im 19 and have a very long history of clinical depression, a very dysfunctional family, and lots of bullying throughout high school.  I’ve been able to stay away from it due to my absolute hatred of withdrawal and letting people down.

The reason I am feeling a relapse coming is because my older brother, my role model, the only person who can truly make me happy on a whim, and also a previous opiate addict just let me down big time.

Codiene is my thing. I've been using it very sparingly (once every two weeks or more, only 3 x 30mg tablets at a time) on a friday night to relax and chill out.

One week I was working away from home and hit the stuff every day for a week straight out of boredom. Stopped at the end of the week and experienced the withdrawal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, restlessness).

I haven't touched the stuff in over two months now. If I was to indulge myself again once every few weeks with a small amount, would I experience those withdrawal symptoms again? Or do they only happen after a prolonged period of use (like a week straight).

Many thanks! ",1532881107.0

Last night I took like 35mg codiene and got some good sleep and for the first time in a long time even before I got on opiates for pain I felt happy and clear minded and I want that feeling back. If I slowly decrease my tramadol usage will things go back to normal? Will I ever be the same again and still be able to live with normal emotions. Here we’re talking maybe a year of on and off usage but around 4 months of heavy usage. After feeling true emotions this morning I’m just worried that even if I stop now they’ll never come back

We were friends with this dude when we first got into the game (me and bf). We’re pretty good at turning dealers into friends. Took him to court dates, picked him up when his crazy gf dropped him on the side of the road (worth mentioning she’s stabbed him TWICE and he’s still with her??) helped each other out whenever we could. Didn’t hear from him for over a year, turns out he went back to prison.  Meet up again, he’s got a bay now and still with this crazy bitch. We decide to try out a tester for free. He ends up throwing some xtra shit in and saying we owe $30. Which I told him to take back cause I had it before and it was shitty shit and I didn’t have money 😂 

Anyways, none of the product was good. We ended up having to take an emergency trip out of town. Should be cool, we’ll pay when we get back even though that is wasn’t the deal. Dude blows us up for 5 days threatening us and shit over $30. He’s never been this way before. I told him if he can’t calm down he won’t ever see us again, and that’s what happened. This was three months ago. 

Queue yesterday, I’m driving around town by myself and missed a road I needed. Pulled into a car dealership to turn around (they were closed for the day). Car pulls in behind me. I’m like ok cool wait for them to move cause they got me blocked in and then I’ll be ok my way. Noticed someone get out the car so now I’m thinking someone is getting dropped off, then they’ll move and I can move. 

Next thing I know this crazy bitch is on my driver side screaming shit at me about money. I’m shocked and am like, “wtf you talking bout?” He comes over laughing saying “I told ya’ll I’d catch up to you where the fucks my money?” At this point I’m like oh shit, hit my lock door button and go to roll my window up cause it was cracked. Bitch instantly reached in and unlocks car and opens in within like two seconds time. My memory is a bit fuzzy but they’re trying to reach over me into my car and trying to pull me out still screaming about money and they got a baby blah blah. For some dumb reason I’m frozen in fright mode cause I don’t wanna right some crazy bitch who will stab her own bf. They find my money and take it, I’m screaming it was only $20 they can’t take ALL my money. He takes what he wants and throws the rest on the ground. I’m circling their car to get a license plate and they don’t fkn have any AND they’re baby is in the car. I’m just like WTF? 

They speed off so I have a brilliant idea to try to follow them and call the police. Cops don’t want nothing to do with it though. Say I gotta go back to where I was and they’ll send someone to take a report or I gotta go to the station (which was coincidentally RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET from where I was robbed.) I’m like you can’t just follow these mother fuckers? So I stop following them cause I ain’t trying to die over $30 I’m just pissed they got in my car and basically assaulted me when they had their BABY with them. 

So half a fuckin hour later a cop shows up. I give them details. Leave out anything about it being drug related but tell them he’s a dealer straight out of prison who should be on parole. They can’t find him in their system with the name I give. 🙄🙄 now I gotta talk to a detective on Monday. Apparently the car dealership has video evidence. I even thought of giving myself a black eye to turn it into assault but idk how far into my car any cameras can see. 

I’m just dumbfounded and shook over the whole thing. 

TL:DR; dont fuck with crazy. Also, I know I’m stupid. Im getting out of this game and trying to lead a new life. ",1532832845.0

I hear stories daily of extremely dangerous and dirty IV use patterns. I see the effects of infection and disease constantly and feel compelled to put together harm reduction kits to offer to people flying signs or to users I meet in my town (unfortunately I cannot give them out at work). I'll include cotton, caps, sterile water packs and alcohol wipes, although I have a question about syringe sizing. If it were for heroin use only I'd select 1cc 28/.5s, but I'm wondering if that would also work well for meth and pills.  What is a good multi substance rig? Also, extra points for a link to the cheapest on the net, in individually wrapped packages.  

Please let me know what else would be helpful in a care pack like this. Thank you very much for your input.

Hell I think the public is experiencing a kind of burn out on addiction, the first time someone you know fatally ODs is a big personal tragedy. The fifth time it happens they tend to get angry at the dead friend, or just annoyed.

Subs have reached mainstream awareness, I'm seeing them used in a lot of normie mainstream memes(white trash starter kit etc). This is NOT a good thing, nothing endangers maintenance therapy more than an ignorant public turning against it. Most people still seem to think the goal of subs is to get people clean for good. I honestly think the law passed allowing buprenorphine to be RXed for maintenance slipped through during a very ""liberal"" period during which RXs of opiates for pain also rose, I doubt bupe would get through today.

I think there is going to be a BIG push for that vivitrol implant, both by the manu and by drug courts etc as its more attractive being feel good free.

The FDA is regulating freaking loperamide sales, kratom already narrowly avoided scheduling but you can be sure they will be back. The war against opiates in pain control is still grinding on.

Street ""heroin"" is no longer actually heroin but fent the majority of the time, and I see this just ramping up. Its just too attractive to criminal orgs, cheap, compact for smuggling, potent, I could go on but street H being fent is here to stay.

Yea things aren't looking so good to me, the one I'm really kind of worried about is increased regulation on sub scripts or even a rearrangement of the concept of writing the scripts as usual. Kinda terrified of no legal easily accessible maintenance med with how badly I have fucked my brain over the years, I might be resourceful but its hard to keep it up forever.

So basically, I no longer use heroin for a number of reasons, on Suboxone for 1+ yr with 1 lapse and 1 relapse in that time (best I've done in years). Ironically it was just a week ago that my household had a needle in it once again.

Anyway, I need to know the length in inches of syringes...I'm working on preliiiiminary ass blueprints for a device that, Godwilling, will make life easier for all you folks in the opiate world. But I don't work for any big company or whatever, Google et al provide me no answer, and as much as it'd seem the most convenient I'm not gonna go to the Riteaid and grab a rig just for this. If a water bottle cap or q-tip can cause that drop in my stomach, a needle will probably have me sprinting towards Philly before I can even get both my shoes on...

THUS, if anyone here has the time and would like to peripherally contribute to something that does the world good --undoing that shit karma that I and virtually all my other opiated friends have accumulated; I speak for myself, but I digress--thennn

Please find a ruler and let me know the measurements of your rigs. Specifically, I'd need to know and least how many cc/mL yours is, and also if you have the gauge and the needle length that would help as well. 
Then, the length in inches (or cm for the non-Americans on here, you're doing me a favor so I'll do the conversions myself) from where the needle protrudes from the barrel/the 0 unit mark up to where the plunger goes in (essentially, the length of the barrel).
In addition to this, I need the length between the bottom of the barrel/0 unit mark and the 10 unit mark.

These seemingly random things will actually help me greatly both to move forward with my project as well as not relapse in the process.



TL;DR
if you have a moment I need somebody to measure a couple things on their syringes with a ruler

Last time I took 1mg when wd's kicked in and I was good til about 8 hours later. My friend said my mind was playing tricks on me and with 1mg if it was working earlier then it still is.
I'd like to split these pills into 1mg pieces, then some into .5 pieces, and maybe some even lower. I know they crumble and are hard to split after 1mg so if i shaved it into fine power and snorted would it have the same effect. Mind you I'm not trying to get high.

The gloominess accentuated my wholly thunderous uncertainty in the world. 

How small I am beneath the clouds. 

The day has just begun, yet I feel the dragging monotony of the clock’s ticking hands. My place is neither with the hours, minutes, nor seconds. 

I fear that I am trapped in some timeless vacuum. Or perhaps a fever-dream. I thought that some light footwork might relieve my irresolute condition, so I paced downstairs to circulate my veins, and show me that my heart is beating. 
It wasn’t so. 

The first drag of my cigarette tasted especially harsh, forcing me to cough and my back to ache. 

My nose was runny - a combination of tobacco and snot configured layers in the back of my throat. My body felt like it wasn’t mine. I was in somebody else’s foreign figure, busting at the seams, desperately trying to get used to this uneasy stomach. 

I stepped outside to ash my smoke and water crept up my socks. I threw up. 
Nicotine and bile coated the pavement. 
True, I shouldn’t have let myself get this terribly ill. It was my spirit that needed a treatment. 

The curative self-prescription awaited me back in my dimly-lit room. 

I poured the powder from the wax bag into a badly burned spoon partly filled with water. The antidote to my aliment required some composing. I burned a match underneath, stirring gently. My fingers quivered in my flawed condition. I steadfastly sipped the serum into my syringe while cutting off my arm’s circulation with a dull rubber band. 
As I poked for a proper vein, I was already feeling my sickness subside. I pushed the plunger down like a panic-button by a bank teller being held hostage, and breathed a sigh of relief like help had come. 

My sweat curled back into my body, and my skin adjusted to feel like mine again.

I peeked through the blinds and saw sunshine. I knew my place in the world as if it was no question at all. ",1532816756.0

I have been using heroin for about 5 years. Now up until this March I could do a shot, (normal shot for me was about 3 points or so) and be straight for about 10 hours. That is when the WD's would start. Example: I'd do a shot at night and wake up early morning sick as fuck and in two more hours I would be in full blown WD by then. Then all the sudden in March, all the dope in my area literally turned to shit. It's like it happened over night. It got to the point where I went through several dealers and could shoot a whole fucking g of dope and not even feel shit except my WD's would sometimes calm down a little. So basically from March until this week I have been shooting grams of dope at a time just to get my WD's at bay and even then sometimes I was still left sick and uncomfortable from the left over WD's.

Well this Wednesday I did my last shot at 5pm. I decided I was done using (for many reasons). It is now Saturday at 3pm and I still feel just fucking fine. I am at a loss of words. I keep waiting to get sick but nothing. So, because of the shitty dope I have been doing, did I just somehow wean myself off it without even noticing? 'Cause remember some of those gram shots still wouldn't take all WD's away and I'd still be a little sick. I don't even know man I can't find anything online about this. I have subs with me thinking I would need them but like I said, I don't feel sick at all. Anyone have this happen to them before? or have any ideas of what the fuck is going on?

I'm from Europe, so using #3. I made this account because my parents, friends, and girlfriend know my main.

Today I used the vein on the very outside of your hand. It runs sort of down your pinky finger and becomes prominent and visible down at your pinky finger joint (as you can tell, my anatomical expertise is unmatched^/s).

&nbsp;


Anyway I registered easily then pushed off very slowly, so as not to blow up this small-ish vein. It still burned and I felt nothing, even though I was in, which I knew since I kept registering and drawing dark blood. **Did I miss or blow up the vein despite going slow?**


Then I gave up and switched to another new vein. This one is fat and runs along my finger, very visible, especially on the bottom joint of the finger. I registered again and pushed off; this time I think I made it because ai felt the taste after a few seconds.

&nbsp;

So my question is: is it possible to be in a small vein, registering, and still missing?! I used 30g needles, so very fine ones. Thanks for helping out!!",1532793245.0

How are all of you lovely individuals doing today? I hope everyone is doing well and having a great day, because each and every one of you deserve it :) 

I read a thread earlier on the dangers of opana, and read something involving how potent oxymorphone is compared to oxycodone. I wanted to know how much stronger by weight oxymorphone is compared to oxycodone, yet couldn't find any results for a direct number through searching. Of course I could find the equianalgesic doses compared to morphine of each, but not of oxymorphone to codone. SO I did some math, which I am not at all good at and really, really hated in school haha. I'm going to rip what I wrote in my comment in the other thread and post it here. Would any of you perhaps have some insight in this and tell me what I did right (if anything) or wrong? I know some of you have to be wonderful with numbers :) Harm reduction is always the goal! And I honestly love pharmacology and medicine. Even though I am clean now and have been for a little over a month, I can't help but have an interest in things like this. Not just opiates, but all medications. Considering studying it in college, actually! Anyways, thank you all in advance :)

 ""My baseline is oral morphine, which has a [bioavailability ](https://i.imgur.com/ncuvBBX.jpg)of 30%. 10 MG = 3 MG absorbed drug. Oxycodone is 1.5 times more potent by weight than morphine, which means that the 3 MG of absorbed morphine = 2 MG of oxycodone. Oxymorphone has a relative strength ranging from [3 to 7 times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equianalgesic) that of morphine, so I used the highest value, which converts to 428 micrograms of oxymorphone at 7 times potency in relation to 3 MG absorbed morphine.

I wanted to check both 40 MG of oral oxymorphone converted to oxycodone as well as 40 MG intranasal oxymorphone converted to oxycodone without using an opioid dose calculator just to get the relative potency of oxycodone to oxymorphone.

40 MG oral oxymorphone at 15% bioavailability = 6 MG of absorbed drug, which equals 42 MG of IV morphine at 7 times the potency. If oxycodone is 1.5 times the potency of morphine by weight, this would mean that 40 MG of oxymorphone orally = 34.8 MG of IV oxycodone, or oxycodone with 100% bioavailability.

To get this figure, I calculated the amount of available oxycodone after ingesting 10 MG at 87% bioavailability, which yields 8.7 MG. Since oxycodone is 1.5 times stronger than morphine, this same dose equals 13.05 MG of morphine and, since oxymorphone is 7x the potency, this equals 1.5 MG. So, 8.7 MG oxycodone = 13.05 MG morphine = 1.5 MG oxymorphone. From here, divide! 8.7/1.5 = 5.8. Oxymorphone is 5.8 times the potency of oxycodone by weight.

Now that I found the figure, I can directly convert. As I already stated, 40 MG oxymorphone = 6 MG absorbed drug which in turn is equianalgesic to 34.8 MG of oxycodone, so eating 40 MG of opana is not exactly like eating an 80. More like a 30. However, if you snort it, this changes quite a lot. At 43% intranasal bioavailability, this same 40 MG opana dose would yield 17.2 MG of available drug which equals 99.72 MG of available oxycodone, which is a **HUUUUGE,** and very potentially deadly, difference! So even if you snort the 40 MG, you still wouldn't be near 330 MG of oral oxycodone, which would yield 287.1 MG of absorbed drug. To get that, you would need 49.5 MG of available oxymorphone in your system, so 3 or so opanas.""",1532794254.0

Making this simple

Someone od’d in my room while I was sleeping.  I’m a heavy sleeper.  My dog relentlessly pawed, scratched, barked, and whined, until finally, she woke me up. 

She would not let me back to sleep I until I looked at him. He was visible dead or close to it. Usually I have to just narcan people be need cpr and narcan.  Anyone from here that knows me and where I live knows at this point emt and rescue would have not made it. I have saved 17 documented lives and 5-6 undocumented, so. Very use to the process. I don’t wig. I’m cool calm and collected. I stayed like this while administering narcan. However after I swore I heard agonal breathing. I was scared shitless. Thought I  lost my first one, who happened to be a good friend. 

To clarify not my first friend to die from heroin, just thought he was my first that I was working on. 

This is obvious missing many details compared to the other but should be easier to read and showcase what a good girl MJ is. 

Also shoutout to Tracey I’ve saved so many lives with kits she sent or from people she put me in touch with as has my dad who has never done Drugs


I hope this is much better for you, if not i give up, and just understand my dog saved life

92k18g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/92k18g/why_opanas_is_dangerous/,36,https://redd.it/92k18g,JakeFromSubway,Why Opanas Is DANGEROUS!!!,"There is a lot of misinformation spreading around about the dosages and the comparisons of the dose ratio of Opanas to Oxycodone, along with the various routes of administration.
As many already know, Oxymorphone is considered to be double the potency of Oxycodone; the opiate most people compare Opanas to. This is a 2:1 ratio, with 2mg of Percocet equaling 1mg of Opana. HOWEVER many people seem to leave out or completely brush over the fact that this ratio is when comparing ORAL ADMINISTRATION of both chemicals! Let me break down why this is so important:

Oxymorphone(Opana/Numorphan) has a very poor oral bio-avaliability, averaging at a measly 10-12% absorption.
Oxycodone(Percocet/Roxicodon/Oxycontin) has a very efficient oral bio-avaliability, averaging around 87% absorption. 

So a 40mg Opana ER pill is equivalent to an 80mg Oxycontin pill when just swallowing. This means that Opanas, even at only 1/10th of it's total potency, are STILL double the value of Oxycodone at near maximum potency. Why is this important? Take a look at the absorption rates of insufflation...

Absorption rate of Oxymorphone when snorted: 42%(OMFG)
Absorption rate of Oxycodone when snorted: 47%(meh)
(This is why doing more than just 10 minutes of research is important when scouting out safety information about opiates if you are a recreational user)

As shown above, Opanas have over 40% bio-avaliability when they are snorted into the nasal cavity. That is QUADRUPLE the potency when compared to oral administration of the same dose. You can also see why Oxycodone is better taken orally rather than up the nostril, with the user losing close to 50% of their potential potency if choosing the latter.

So with a bit of simple multiplication and division, here are the results: Suppose you just scored a 40mg G74 Opana ER, and you are trying to figure out dosing, but the only other pill you have had experience with is Percocets and Oxycontin:
1.
40mg Opana is equal to 80mg of Oxycodone, or double the potency, if you choose to eat your dose.
2.
Snorting 40mg of Opana is equal to OVER 160MG+ OF ORAL OPANA!!! This is also equivilent to 320mg-340mg of oral Oxycodone. 
3.
With these results, an opiate naiive person would have to snort as little as a 2mg Opana dose, and even that would be close to snorting a full 30mg Roxicodone in one go.
I hope you fools out there now understand how dangerous it is to snort Opanas when you don't have a tolerance. Comments and Feedback are appreciated. Thank you!

Anyways, for whatever reason there is a huge dry spell here on opis, benzos, narcotics, subs, etc. (Totally separate and ironic story, I just found about 2 grams of super HQ METH in a random gas station bathroom today, so while Junky Jesus isn't with me today, Stimulant Santa Maria seems to be! So there's that... But I digress...)

*THE REAL QUESTION STARTS HERE:*

I have Tramadol HCL 50mgs. Probably about 35 of them. They were prescribed to my dog after surgery but she seemed to do better with the other meds she was also given. Like, every time I gave her a dose of the tramadol she'd start crying and wouldn't sit still. So, no I was not being a bad dog mom and hoarding her meds. In fact, I literally just remembered I had them and it's from almost a year ago. Just wanted to clear that up. I love my pooch. 

So, you know where I'm going with this. I've never taken this shit. I can't find straight answers online without reading through a bunch of bullshit SWIM took tramadol and blah blah. I guess it's a synthetic codeine or something and an opioid agonist, which sounds nice enough. 

So, should I take it and how much and do you think it will make me sick? Some people online saying they were just super nauseated but I always take dramamine before I do dope. Soo... Thoughts? Verdicts?

I’m looking for some help on how to bring it down a few notches","It’s not like I need to explain this to y’all, but god damn, dope has me feeling like a total fiend! Three weeks ago I was a moderate oxy user with a 60-120mg/day habit and could get by if funds were getting tight or access was limited but three weeks ago I bought some dope after a 4 year break. Blues were MIA for awhile so I jumped back on the devils wagon and it’s getting outta hand. I want to taper down to a manageable regimen, here’s what’s in the stash currently:

-2 grams of decent ECP with access to more

-8 pharma blues with access to more

-Roughly 250mg of liquid methadone with limited access to more of 150mg once a week

-Four 4mg sub strips and one 8mg strip with probable access to more (haven’t taken any in many years, worried about PWD)

-Plenty of clonidine, hydroxyzine, trazodone (meh) and phenibut 

-no benzos or gabas with some access to them. I don’t have any desire to take benzos but I do love gabas. Ran out awhile ago and haven’t seen anymore 

The goal here is to put down the dope for awhile and get back to where I was, not even 8 months ago I could be happily buzzed all day on 45mg of oxy. Now I’m skyrocketing into sniffing dope ALL DAY. What would you do here?

People making multiple accounts so they can post negative things about other people, harassment of some sub members, and also doxxing. The mod team has been attacked for being biased assholes on a power trip, and this is just a recap of *some* of it.

We are all adults in this sub. I don't understand why some people can't act like it. If your having a problem with another sub member, block them, don't argue with them for an entire post. Act like the adult that you are. If the problem is serious, contact the mods. If you feel you are being harassed, please contact the mods or better yet the admins. To contact the admins send a PM to /r/reddit.com We are generally a group of good people, some of us think of each other as family. But some of us have been behaving badly, and it's sad. The mods have been working furiously for several days to handle this. Sub members here have no idea the things we have to deal with, they only hear one persons side and decide we're assholes. We keep logs of who we ban, why we ban, when we ban them, we have a private wiki of sorts where we keep notes and keep track of shit and communicate. Fuck we have spread sheets for shit. I know I personally put in around 15 hours a week modding here. Being a mod isnt fun, it's work. We get no perks, no pay, and are berated and insulted every single day. I've been threatened that I will be doxxed, that someone will take my kids, that someone will rape and kill me several times. all because I banned someone or wont unban them. Yet everyone complains how were assholes.
The other mods put in hours and hours too,and are fully devoted to this sub. They also receive hate messages and are harassed. I am not looking for pity or a pat on the back. I'm trying to make everyone aware that the mod team **does care** if we didn't we sure as hell wouldnt be here 

Im imploring all of you to please stop with the fighting, name calling, alt accounts, and general harassment of other members. We are looked down on enough by society already, we should all be able to come here and not be harassed or called names or berated. This is supposed to be a supportive community.

I’ve come to realize that over the course of a decade of abusing opiates and other drugs I’ve rewired my brain. It’ll never be the same.

I’ve come to find out that by working the 12 steps I can maintain some level of sobriety and happiness in my life, but given enough time I find myself miserable, depressed, and shortly there afterwords relapsing. Ive taken what I’ve learned at rehabs, halfway houses, IOP, and 12 step groups  and found what works for me. It’s so simple but yet the hardest thing I’ve ever done.

No problem. I hit her up on Friday but she was visiting her man in the hospital all day, apparently. He got clubbed in the head a couple of months ago, I'm not sure if he's brain dead, paralyzed or what but from what I understand he hasn't been moved from the hospital for a couple of months. Yes, I know this doesn't quite add up.. I didn't ask for more details than what I already know. 

&nbsp;

I have no idea if his condition is improving, he must be somewhat responsive to his surroundings if she's spending time with him but maybe she's just waiting for a break in a coma to get him to sign off some money, IDK this is all conjecture on my part.

&nbsp;

So I hit up that Friday and she's basically telling me later. So as it got late I ask her to level with me, ""is there a chance you *wont* be able to meet me tonight?"" I don't get a definite yes or no but the answer was indicative to me that she wouldn't be available that night. Each prior update was like a delay and an excuse. Now she's telling me ""I'm still with my man in the hospital and the stuff is at home."" I was more than willing to meet her near her house whenever was convenient.

&nbsp;

So I end up hitting up Tim and he asked to borrow $20 til Monday. He said he could give me one Zub on the spot and the other on Monday. So I took it then by Sunday he asked me if I had anything because he ran out because he paid his brother back who he owed subs to. It's tricky for me to share, I ration my subs and I think of all that can go wrong when planning. I didn't end up getting the second Zub til Tuesday. 

&nbsp;

During that weekend, I asked the girl again if she could serve me subs because hell.... although it was fishy, she never said she couldn't. Just kept deferring, delaying and so forth. Finally I ask ""what about this Wednesday"" and hse says ""Probably will have.."" but when I asked on Wednesday she said ""Monday"", the day she goes to the doctor. That's the same day Tim plans to pay me back. 

&nbsp;

I could wait to see her on Monday but I'm not counting on that. One time she told me she had a doctor appointment, said ""I'll be out in an hour."" I hit her up two hours later to set plans for that evening and she agrees. Then later I confirm them, she still agrees. Then one hour before I'd be arriving to meet her she tells me that she gotta wait a couple of days to pick it up from the pharmacy.

Like she didn't know this hours earlier? I'm guessing this is like when Cliff would get a script, send me to get it and find out he was a day early to fill it. Probably what happened to her, makes the most sense to me.

&nbsp;

So come Monday, if I count on her I'm bound to have to wait one more day. On top of that, I can't really count on her word that it'll definitely be ready when I make plans to meet her. So my best bet is to hedge my bets. Thus I hit up Tim, maybe he wants to earn a few bucks this way again. Well, he's on a higher dose.. I think 16mg per day. However, he does take his full dose when he has them on hand so there's not a lot of wiggle room. 

Basically, he wants to borrow $20 until Monday and he said he'll give me three Zubs for the wait. Last time he owed me a sub I picked it up the day after he picked up the script. This time I really 
would prefer to get my Zubs the day he gets his since that'll be the last day I'll have a dose to take in the morning. 

&nbsp;

I told and asked him four different ways and he basically assured me that he'll have it on Monday and that I would be able to pick it up before work. I'm willing to count on Tim more than the other person..... I don't really want to ride my bike out of the way on that day before I go to work but if it's gotta be done I'll do it to mitigate the risks. Such as if he couldn't meet me the following day for any reason. 

&nbsp;

At the moment I turned a four day supply into a five day supply so that I could make it to Monday. I all goes well, when I get my next dose I could continue on the lower dosage since I'm essentially beginning to taper down from the 2mg dosage. If it goes well, I may be able to stabilize on 1mg per day by the end of the week. This would bring me closer to stabilizing on an even lower dose and eventually make jumping off to be a more palatable decision. 

&nbsp;

BTW, I was seriously considering going to a real doctor. There was an issue with my pay check, I didn't get paid for three of the days I worked. Truthfully I'd prefer not going to a doctor but considering the events I just described it's an option that comes with a higher level of certainty. ",1532723434.0

Now I only do good H, and occasionally IV morphs if I cant find the brown. I take an 8mg strip every morning before work, and although I typically work 10-12 hour days, I can still get a good high going once Im off. However, I get off work early on occasion, and still been able to get a decent high going 8 or even 6 hours after taking my subs. 6 is pushing it, but I definitely still get high. Anything less than that, and the high is significantly diminished to the point where it isnt worth shooting up. Now even if I wait my typical 8-10-12 hours later, I obviously do not get as high as I would get if I skipped a day of subs (which I often do on the weekends), but high enough to not regret wasting money and time afterwards. I get a rush, high, everything. Then I take another sub in the morning the next day, and can still get high after work the day after as well. Never had PWDs from doing this either. Been doing this for almost a year, and it hasnt changed. And when I dont get high after work (i shoot up maybe once or twice during the week days, weekends are a diferent story, as I often skip the subs altogether on weekends), my subs still work all day long as they should. I know people on a lower sub dose who say they can't get high at all 24 hours or so after taking their subs. But I can. This isnt a placebo. Ive been fucking around with opiates for years. I know a good high when I feel one. Any theories? Or am I just a freak? 

Edit -I DO NOT encourage anyone else to try this just because it works for me. Precipitated withdrawals are very real, and trying to ""break through"" your subs can lead to an overdose very easily. This is just my experience, and I am sharing it.",1532712530.0

Anyone else heard any massive whoppers from their dealer?

Update: It took 15 minutes after he said 5 minutes for the last time.

Total time 2hr35min after being told ""5 minutes""


Weird thing was, it wasn't even him in the end. It was his runner who has been on foot all day and I saw earlier.. So what was all that nonsense about driving to me?


I've worked as a runner with another guy a while back when I was desperate. One guy drove, I handled the deliveries and the money. There was very little wait generally,  from time of calling to getting to them, in fact, we were pissed off because WE had to wait quite a few times.. I guess because customers are so used to slow dealers that they call ahead and say that they are there 20 minutes before they get somewhere so they don't have to wait.. which fucks up dealers schedules that actually organised and are on-time.

I will say this though.. we were slow getting somewhere only a couple of  times cos the guy I was with was one of those people that when he wants a smoke on the pipe or to run some lines, he has to set up all his paraphernalia, get it all correct and in order, settle into his chair, take his time, wait between each line and generally be a fucking grandad about the entire operation. 

Because he lived in the center of town in an apartment, whenever there was a break between deliveries, he would drive back there, set stuff up and sit down to do his thing. It would take 25 minutes from walking in to his first hit. Meanwhile, i've mastered the art of getting drugs into me within moments of actually getting it into my hand!


The dealer is calling us to the next location.. he never used his phone, too paraboid to answer or speak to anyone so he hands every call to me. I'm trying to hurry this asswipe up and I'm getting screamed at by the big cheese on the phone because he's getting customers call him every 2 minutes asking where the hell we are and we haven't even left.


Oh my god.. and when we did arrive at locations when there was a break in service, the queue of 20 or so people all holding fistfuls of cash and trying to be first to get served drove me to distraction. Form a line, everyone gets served... Nope, fights literly breaking out to hand us cash and be off with their stuff. I can't hear a thing over the shouts of orders ""2 this 4 that 2 boy, 3 white, 3 girl, 2 dark, 6 light.. etc etc."" All of them claiming they get discount or deals or they spoke to our guy who made a promise. We had to double check so we didn't come back short of money so everyone got more and more angry when we were slow trying to call and confirm shit. Trying to remember orders and numbers and cash values in your head, while 15 people shout numbers at you is fucking difficult too.

I had nine months clean, then overdosed and almost died in May. Woke up to paramedics in the ghetto narcanned 4x. Ive was scared straight since that day til July 4th... I shitty day at work (I work in customer service and it really fucking sucks) and had a fight with another coworker 4th of July. That night an old friend I used to live with at sober house hit me up and I relapsed.. it's my fault but I would never had gone thru with it without him enabling me and feeling less guilty about it. He's fucked tho and about to lose everything again. Hell last time I hung out with him a few days ago he casually told me he had to use a vein in his foreskin

I've been using everyday since. It's is a big open air drug market basically. For crack and heroin. I inject roughly 7 shots a day (not big shots, since the recent overdose has me extremely cautious) compulsively.

Today i was running low on dope. So I ventured to a new dopespot since I heard good things and bought 6 bags thinking it'd be the same meh dormin cut dope I always get. I go to the spot and get served at a spot literally a block away from my friends recommended spot. No. I shoot it and feel nothing. I inspect it more and it really doesn't look that different from the dope that normally is around here (dormin cut) but it could very easily be dry wall shavings too. I'm so pissed. I injected 100 ccs of god knows what in my arm. I then went to another spot later that day and got ripped off again!! I sniffed it too to see if there was anything but nothing. Different bag but same shitty drywall looking dope

I'm bout to crash and feeling sick coming on. I'm gonna be sick tomorrow morning. It's fucked because I split a bag with another addict at the REAL spot block away after i bought these shit bags and it was really good and euphoric but they didn't serve me right away. It's all these ghetto kids trying to eat a quick buck that don't really use caution and will try and sell you anything. Fuck this shit I'm so upset

In Sept 2017 my PM doc wanted ct images of the surgery site because my pain had been increasing. 

10 months ago everything was super...but the pain was putting me at an impasse.

So last PM appt on the 12th of July my doc called the pharmacy and had my meds upped without telling me.

He told me I had very little say (I mean he was trying to be helpful) and that I needed better relief.  So I boarded the oxycodone train... Now my username has lost it's zest in my eyes 😅.

Anyways, so now I'm taking that 5ml liquid every 6 hours (5mgs) and it tastes like a weird version of adult cotton candy...

So I get orders at this appt to get a follow up CT scan of my lumbar/sacral/hips.  My doc says he's interested to see the results especially of the hip area...

On the 19th I go.  I get the scan and all the while the techs are asking me if I'm in any pain and they are suuuper attentive.  A few mins out of the tube the tech walking me out says the radiologist is reading my lumbar pics...this perplexes me as to why they're looking at it so soon.  I had hoped it was a slow day at the office.

Every time I get scans I think the worst and usually they don't find anything too alarming.

This time I think that all's gonna turn out ok...fuck it if I wasn't dead wrong!

I get a call this past Monday.  My screws are loose and a fixator is in the disc above...my vertebrae has skipped 9mm and is narrowing part of my large intestine....

GREAT JUST FUCKING GREAT

I went to my surgeon yesterday.  He walks out and in and tells me they gotta open me up *again* and get the hardware out...
.
In 10 months I went from ok to shit

He says he's never seen damage like that without trauma occurring...

Get a call this morning from my PM doc saying they're adding that nasty ass liquid morphine for me post op in top of the oxy.

I'm in love with this subreddit and I wish I had found it a lot sooner, so I made this account just to engage in this community. Just somewhere to get out this hidden part of my life, to anyone. If anyone reads it at all, I'd be very thankful, but even if not, I appreciate the existence of a place a struggling addict can let it out to people who truly get it. Thank you all.

Story time!

I had posted a bit ago about being nervous to cold cop for my first time, as well as it being the first time I would have copped in a long time as I've been sober for over 6 months. Well, the day after posting that I found a person on whisper who, after having a seemingly really nice conversation about both of our struggles, agreed to middle for me with their blue connect. Drove 40 minutes to pick him up to grab 4, was going to throw him one for the troubles, but lo and behold....

He took the money and walked off.

Anyway since then I've still had that same craving, but that incident kind of reminded me how separate I am from the game even though I wasn't gone for that long. A year ago, I wouldn't have given a fuck how nice the person was; I never would have let my money walk with a stranger. I guess sobriety made me a bit naive!

Now to today. I had posted about how terrified I was about cold copping. I'd never done it while I was using before, even though I live right outside of a major northeast city that doesn't exactly make it challenging to do. I always seemed to have people who could drop it off or middle for me, and being a scrawny nerdy white dude, I just went with the what I perceived as the safest option. But considering all of those options are gone now, when the craving hit today I decided to overcome my fear and finally cold cop. I really struggled with this decision, because honestly, getting robbed almost seemed like the universe's last-ditch effort to tell me not to go back to getting high. But... well, you all understand what I mean when I say sometimes it would take more than the universe to prevent me from getting my fix. Not having money on hand today as payday is tomorrow, I went to a pawn shop and sold an old guitar, got about $70 for it. Put some gas in my car, grabbed some Newports and a pack of Sour Patch kids, and I was prepared just like old times. But shitting my pants because I've never bought this way before, and the last time my middle had gotten dope from this part of the city was the last time I got high (2 bags knocked me off my ass and into an overdose).

I take the 45 minute drive into the city, but I don't know any specific blocks to drive down, or really what to do at all. Actually, all I know is the area of the city most famous for its drug market. No more information. I'm stressing the entire ride there, not only about the action which I'm taking, but also about how little I know about what I'm about to do. Should I park somewhere and just walk up and down some streets? Should I park and leave my windows down and wait? Should I ask a homeless person like I've seen some other people on this subreddit do? I literally have no idea.

I finally get to the section of the city, and having driven through it a couple times before WAY back when I used to sell weed in my hometown for a guy down there, I get even more stressed out. I certainly don't look like I fit in, and the amount of chaos is pretty overwhelming. It reminds me of that marketplace scene in Black Hawk Down, but instead of guns being sold on the street like crazy, its dope. But I drive around and recognize a street that a couple of my friends I had met in sobriety said they used to buy from, so I drove down it.

Being pretty damn nervous, I drove down the block once and couldn't bring myself to try to buy. I did this twice actually. Both times gave me an opportunity to observe, but honestly at that point I was thinking ""they certainly think I'm a cop now.""  On my third pass, it was time to do it, because the anticipation of my first fix in so long outweighed that stress. I'm already here, it's gotta happen. And when it finally does...

I realize I'm a fucking idiot for not ever doing this earlier. It was quite literally the easiest thing I have ever done. Some dude yells ""dope,"" I give him a nod, he tells me to pull over, I get out of my car, hand him the money, I get the dope. Literally was a two minute process when I actually decided to do it.

So I've rejoined the Bropiate crew! Only copped two bags because of how nervous I was about the fentanyl, but I just finished up the second one and I'm still here! JJ has seemingly been on my side. Fire china too, or maybe just very low tolerance. Either way, I'm nodding up a storm :)

**TL;DR** I made the decision to relapse for the second time since being sober for 6 months, the first time getting me robbed. Was super stressed about cold copping, ended up being super easy and am now happy, stress free, and high as fuck :)",1532676236.0

I think I've found a way that doesn't involved chemistry and is almost free.

Now I know I will be laughed at, I have no idea of what to expect people to say to this post and idea. But here's the way I think about it: this method is much better than prostitution or stealing. So laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded, and I believe it to be far preferable to any of the other shit people do, less shameful, and more moral.

So here it is. tl;dr at the bottom.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

So I've been trying to find a way to make opiate use sustainable. If you could use 1/10 the amount of heroin you do now, then 1 gram that lasts you 5 days would instead last you 50 days. That takes something from completely unsustainable to very sustainable.

Now, traditional ways of using less don't really work. It's hard to reduce tolerance besides stopping using completely, any tolerance supplements usually just slow the growth of tolerance, they don't actually reduce it.

So I've been thinking hard about ways to increase the supply. Maybe you could make the half life longer? I researched that but realized it'd be too hard for the most part, there's so many enzymes and methods of excretion your body uses. But while reading about the metabolism of heroin/morphine, I found something quite interesting.

Over 90% of the heroin/morphine you inject is excreted renally (in the urine). So I looked at the metabolites.

60% of morphine/heroin is turned into morphine-6-glucuronide. 15% is turned into morphine-3-glucuronide. The other 15% in the urine is just normal morphine. The other 10% is shit out.

Just so you know, morphine-glucuronides are just morphine with a sugar molecule attached where the acetic acid is attached in heroin. The body does this so that the morphine becomes super water soluble and stays in the blood and can be filtered into the urine. Remember how sugar is super water soluble? Morphine glucuronides aren't like other metabolites. Most metabolites physically alter the actual drug and destroy it, this keeps morphine exactly how it is. Just like heroin can be turned easily back into morphine with no work, morphine-glucuronides can be turned back into morphine with no work either.

So I think you can see where I'm going with this. Yes, I am saying we should extract the morphine from our urine and re-use it.

Just think about it. Within the urine of a heroin addict is 90% of the morphine they just injected. It's extremely simple. You just boil it down, use a very easy to get enzyme that removes the glucuronides/use HCL to remove the glucuronides, and then use acids/bases/solvents to extract the morphine, then boil down until it's dry. All you have to do is turn the glucuronides into morphine, and the use PH to selectively remove the morphine. This is chemistry at it's simplest, using materials you can buy at Walmart, and it'd take less than an hour to do. Extremely simple, cheap, and fast.

Don't think the rewards would be big enough to justify it? Well look at these calculations:

Let's say you injected 200mg of pure heroin a day (sidenote, most heroin on the street is less than 25% actually heroin, most is less, meaning someone injecting a gram of bullshit street mix is actually only injecting about 200mg a day of actual heroin. Heroin is very strong, 200mg is a lot, most people here would need 100mg or less a day).

So let's say you inject 200mg of 100% pure heroin/diamorphine. If you used the urine alchemy method, you'd recover 180mg of said heroin, and would be able to reuse that. So if you used my method for all the urine you produced, you'd only be losing 20mg a day, instead of 200mg a day. (10% of 200 = 20).

Think about how powerful that'd be. At 200mg a day, a gram of pure heroin would only last 5 days when used normally. Using my method, 200mg IV a day would allow a gram to last **50 days** instead of 5. Because if you extracted it from all urine, you'd only lose 20mg a day in your shit. 20mg times 50 = 1000mg/1gram.

So instead of spending $150 every 5 days on DNM heroin, you'd be spending $150 every 50 days. Instead of spending $900 a month on heroin, you'd spend $900 a year (instead of $10,800 a year when buying every 5 days, which is ridiculous).

Do you realize how fucking powerful that is? Do you realize how sustainable that makes using an opiate? You wouldn't even have to worry about money at all!

And for other opiates it's even better. Over 95% of hydromorphone/dilaudid is pissed out. That means, using this method, a 12mg shot would last you 20 shots at least, instead of one shot. (12/100 x 5 = .6 times 20 = 12).

And if you took glucuronic acid as a supplement, I bet you'd be able to piss out 95% or more of the heroin you inject.

So with this method, you only lose 10-5mg a day per 100mg injected for morphine.

And if you extracted from your shit I bet you'd be able to use less than 1mg a day per 100mg IV, but extracting from shit is too much for me, won't do that.

All you'd have to do is collect all urine you piss out in an empty gallon jug. Then every week you go out to the woods. make a fire, and empty it all into a big steel bucket which is over the fire. Boil it down until the liquid is very reduced, let it cool, and then use enzymes/HCl to remove the glucuronic acid. Then use ph strips and solvents to extract the morphine, and boil that down until very little liquid is left, then let it completely evap using a glass pan. The morphine extracted can then easily be re-esterified into an equally potent heroin analog using glacial acetate, propionate anhydride, benzoic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinic acid, etc. Easy mode, and as strong or stronger than diacetylmorphine.

And this isn't even mentioning the fun you could have using metabolites like normorphine (which could be turned into n-phenethylnormorphine). But I won't go into that in this post.

I just wanted to make this post because a couple weeks ago I created this idea, and I think it would really help people. Laugh all you want, this post is for the open minded. I want to share this free method, so that people can have a gram of heroin last them 50 days instead of 5. Basically, however long a gram lasts you, multiply that by 10, and that's how long the same gram would last you using this method (this only goes for non-fent heroin, fent dope can still be used for this method as long as there's heroin in it). If you laugh and say ""that's too complicated/weird bro why not just buy heroin?"", well I say this in return: have fun hustling, waking up sick, wasting all your money, or doing illegal and shameful things like stealing or prostituion to get your dope. This method may be weird but allows you to stop all those things, because they'd be unnecessary. 

**TL;DR** - 90% of the heroin you inject is urinated out as morphine. This can be extracted from the urine easily and turned back into an equally-potent-to-heroin morphine-ester. With this method, 90% of the heroin you inject can be reused. This means that if you inject 200mg heroin a day, you'll only lose 20mg a day. This means that instead of a gram lasting 5 days, a gram will last 50 days. Awesome, right?",1532646064.0

The crook my left arm has always been my go-to, but I never used this particular vein due to difficulty in the past. Looking down my left arm, this is the vein on the left (of the 2 main veins in crook of arm.) 

I have long-tip syringes, and i stick it all the way in, and slowly pull out till blood starts filling the chamber. It is clearly in a vein, the blood flows into the chamber and it's the good, dark red. I push down and inject my dope. It seems a little more painful than an average shot, but nothing like a miss. No bumps or any other signs of a miss or hit artery afterwards. 

I think the lack of finesse involved in this technique is sketching me out a bit. Is there anything that could be happening other than me getting into a vein? The blood is flowing and it's the dark color that we search for. I'd like to have my arms if I decide to get clean again.

I haven't done any opiates since last saturday but I did use kratom on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday and lope on Monday and Tuesday. Will I get thrown into PWDs?","Hi all, 

I've been clean for about 6 days I think but my family doesn't believe me. They're saying that I have to take naltrexone everyday starting tomorrow under their supervision or else they will cut contact with me. The last time I did dope was on Saturday morning so it will be nearly a week. Problem is I was using kratom and lope to get over the withdrawals on Monday and Tuesday. I've read some horror stories and am really worried about being sent into withdrawal. I have to work all weekend so I can't afford to just write it off and be sick again. Is this something I should be worried about or am I in the clear?

EDIT: Prior to saturday I was clean for like 2 weeks if that changes anything.

I’m sure some of y’all can relate to this.

I’m court ordered to this halfway house at the moment and I’ve been clean for about a month and half now. It’s not so bad, there’s some stupid little rules that get annoying, but other than that I’m just working and coming back to the house everyday. It sure beats wasting away in jail.  I’ve got about another month here if everything goes as planned. 

Here lately I’ve been thinking about moving across the country when I get out. I’m from the southeast and haven’t ever really left the state I’m in. With the way I’ve been feeling lately, I think it would help me have a new perspective on life. I don’t have a SO or any kids to worry about either. 

With that being said, being sober has allowed me to look back at my life and I’ve realized that I can’t ever be content. I work out, eat healthy, have sex when I can, have a good job, and just a lot of things to be grateful for, but I wanna just run away once my felony is dismissed and start a new life. I often romance about just being on the road and sometimes wanna add being a junkie into the mix but I know that I’m not gonna be content with that either. I have hobbies like playing guitar and going fishing but at the end of the day I’m just never satisfied. 

I think about moving away for awhile and doing a gram shot and hoping my family just never finds out that I’m gone because I’d hate to put them through the pain of losing me at such a young age over my own selfishness. 

I’m tired of lacking real connection with human beings because of social media. If you’ve ever read the book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, it’s about being self sufficient and being okay with the most simple things in life. I kinda want to do that if it’s possible.

I draw up a tad more water and dump it in the cooker. Mix mix mi.... 

Oh boy. Off to the Land of Nod we go. I got half my rig in mouth, the other half in my left hand mixing. Right hand? What are you doing over there? We’re not worried about it. We are the Eternal King in the Land of Nod. Also, we’re totally great at multitasking... And then. THEN!  I hear the worst sound ever. A flutter... the tiniest of flutters, the tiniest of sounds. I wake up. 

The peaceful Land of Nod has been invaded. Armies are called to the front lines. Sirens of Doom and Destruction go off. I snap to immediately, awakened abruptly from the Peaceful and Wonderful Land of Nod.

There's one bag, unopened on the table. But where... oh god. Where is the other, freshly opened gram? My eyes drift to the table where there are relics and instructions on how to enter The Land of Nod. Nothing. Destruction? Thievery? We know nothing yet. 

I survey further down, to where my non-functioning dick sits. Oh sweet baby... it looks like Tony Montana was up on hard times and tried ravishing my dick in a coke fueled rage. There is powder everywhere. Seeped into my jeans in every crevice. Tony you shit. Take off my pants first. 

Fuck. Fuck fuck. That’ll be barely salvageable. Tony wasn’t fucking around. I continue my search further, to Lady Freya’s (my fucking dog) domain. Wanton destruction and doom.

Oh. And the reason I couldn’t cop a nod from the 3/4g bag, was the needles I was using were too large. I typically can’t go any larger than 29 gauge, but I prefer 30/31, as my veins are tiny.

I decided to make it a low priority, just as he made it a low priority to not sell me spice in lieu of dope weeks prior. Fast forward to the other day, I texted him instead of my sub connect by accident. Immediately went ""oops wrong #"" but also said ""I trust all is well..""""

&nbsp;


Well anyway, he texted me today asking me to call him back because he had ""something to confess."" Confess? Last I checked, I'm am not a priest. So, I was curious and called him back. First it was the pleasantries, like how I was and then I asked how he was doing. He told me about work he has done on his bicycle, how he saw a video that helped him tune his bicycle's mechanical disc brakes to work better than they have in a while. I briefly shared some of my bike upgrade adventures and experience working on brakes as well.

&nbsp;

Then the conversation shifted gears a little bit. ""Ever since I've been going to this methadone program, a few months ago before I started the program, I was a bottom feeder. Like I was always the one who needed something from someone. You know, I need this and need that and ever since I started the program it's been so consistent that I don't need nobody nothing. And so it's been hard to adapt to that to not need everything from everyone. You have an idea what it's like as opposed to being oblivious to it.""



I acknowledged that it can be hard, that if one doesn't keep busy it's easy to be unsure what to do with one self and express agreement.


&nbsp;



""In all reality when things like that happen it only makes us stronger....""


I continue to express agreement.


&nbsp;



Then I asked him, ""how's your tire?"" He responds to explain, ""here's the thing about the tire.."" 


Finally, we get to the confession. 


He goes on, ""I had to do a thing for Cliff and I changed my tire and the tube ended up blowing in the new tire.. so umm Cliff gave me an idea by saying you have a junk yard of tubes tires next to your doorstep.""


&nbsp;


In other words, a couple of weeks ago at 4am on ~~Cliff's pay day~~ Cliff's mom's pay day, Derrick was tasked with biking to the ATM and then to his plug for Cliff. When his tire blew out, by Cliff's recommendation he retrieved it from the junk tire stack. 


&nbsp;

Coincidentally, I was actually planning to give that tire to Derrick. 
Originally when I was still doing dope in order to get free dope, but now just because I need to get rid of it anyway. The tire size is of a type I don't intend on using again at least not for a while. At which point I wouldn't use a derelict tube that has been exposed to the elements. It's best someone gets to use it while it's still not completely wrecked on the molecular level.



&nbsp;

No harm done, wish I could find the salvage scene on the surveillance DVR just for shits and giggle. Should I appreciate liberties being taken with my trash? Yeah, just a little bit at least but like I said it was trash. 



Then lastly, after already explaining how he has been making so much progress with the methadone program he's on, explaining how he don't gotta do anything for anyone he explains he's in a minor pickle. He only has half the money needed in order to buy a bundle and wanted to know if I wanted to get on board with an order. 

&nbsp;


I've been keeping my nose clean so it was easy to say ""no, thank you."" 



&nbsp;


#P.S. --

For those of you wither literary blue balls, for those who feel like they were struck ill and given too little dope to get straight, for those and especially for those who sat through Battlestar Galactica 1980 (the weird third season of the original) - I wish to rectify this situation. Well, actually when I hastily finalized this post that last sentence is a sign that I've made great strides towards rectifying a more important issue but y'all came here for meat and potatoes with a hint of a certain kind of non-existent (as has been argued by some) ethnic spice. 


&nbsp;

TBH I thought the included details were sufficient. Perhaps if I am to post a something so disappointing it could have been done with less words. Perhaps if it were less diluted the flavor of this post would've been enjoyable. I don't have any obligation to answer for my literary crimes but I'll try something. If it don't stick, maybe the last completely unrelated point will.

* No longer am I the person who leave's Cliff's bed bug infested house at 3:52 AM with ~~his~~ his mom's debit card to withdraw money to get Cliff out of withdrawal while earning two bags for myself in addition to what I buy.


* Weeks ago Cliff hit me up to see if I would do it and said ""I'll have to send Derrick since you don't spend big on partying anymore."" At the time he expected me to clamor and say ""no wait, I will do it.. and I'll get X buns too!


* A week and a half ago Cliff called me at 9 AM (I ignored) at time I'd normally be sleeping to see if I would pick up his oxy script even though days earlier I said that I was good, well and done! In his selfish wishful thinking mindset, he neglected to remember the many times in the past when I said don't call me for anything before 11am. 


* When I used to pick up Cliff's script I'd sometimes get called if the script was ready earlier as though I was a parent in bed on Christmas morning. When I'd complain he'd be like ""but you're getting something out of it.""


* Derrick is on a methadone program. He says he doesn't need the dope anymore, he's not beholden to anyone yet he still middles in order to earn some dope.


* He once said to Cliff, ""I'd like to talk about getting a raise."" Cliff was not having it, ""if he thinks I'm going to spend all that money and give him half of MY dope.."" Funny thing, that statement gave me the opportunity to say to Cliff something along the lines of ""now you know how  I feel.""


* Derrick told me he was clean and good, that the methadone program has been great for him but still hit me up to see if I'd at least go halvsies on a bun. I don't know if I can make sense of or reconcile his words and his actions. 


* I can't really judge Derrick on the last point either, I've spent a good amount of time alternating between maintenance medication and dope before I decided to exclusively stick with maintenance. 


* These bullet points aren't going to satisfy everyone, perhaps no one.
 

* Bottom line, Derrick took an inner tube off of a junked bike that was sitting in my driveway at 4am to perform a dope run.


&nbsp;


Finally....


The main reason I posted was because I was having a hard time reconciling the way Derrick is talking out of two sides of his mouth. He says things have changed for the better for him since being on the methadone program but he's literary doing the same shit he did before - just not getting sick in between.


That is all, for those who said or thought to themselves, ""why did I read that whole thing"", now you may ask why you read that whole thing and then that other whole thing at the bottom.",1532595548.0

At the moment I am on around 200mg of oxy per day and don't even get high, this is just to be able to function, I remember when I first started a 10mg pill would have me feeling amazing!! 20mg would be too much and make me feel sick! Now I need around 60-80mg to get out of bed..

I'm trying to work out a plan to try to lower my tolerance without experiencing horrible withdrawals if possible.. 

Just wondering if anyone has any tips to help lower tolerance as quick as possible with as little pain as possible other than cold turkey..

I've read that if you an refrain from taking any opiates for
-3 days you halve your tolerance 
-7 days you return to baseline tolerance 

Some ideas I've thought about are using:
Kratom 
Ketamine
Low Dose Naltrexone 

Just wondering what sort of experiences you guys have had trying to reduce your tolerance using the above drugs or if anyone has any other tips?

His grandmother passed away (RIP Ruth, thanks for always driving me home when I was a kid even though I reeked of weed) and he said he found a few of each; original OC 80s, 8mg Mallinckrodt Dilaudid, 50mcg fentanyl patches, and a bunch of weaker opiate/acetaminophen pills.

Fent's not my game, and don't want to deal with acetaminophen even if I could still get high off percs.  Basically, I've decided to get either the Dilaudid, the OC, or some combination of the two. The OC 80s are $114 a piece and the Dillys are $29.  I have $150.  I could get 2 doses out of each Dilly (shot) and 4-5 doses out of each OC (snorted)

So!  Should I buy one OC and one Dilaudid, shooting the dilly and then snorting the OC?  I would run out of the Dilaudid quicker (only 2 rushes) but be left with 2-3 more doses of intranasal oxy to do with what I please.  Plus I have heard legendary things about the OC 80s.  

or

Should I just get 5 Dilaudid (10 rushes).

I've heard great things about the OC 80s, but its hard to tell how much is nostalgia.  Still, I'm really torn on this.  Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",1532584709.0

I walked back into the living room. I put her phone on the lamp stand next to me and grabbed the lighter to light my joint. It was easy to tell it was the good stuff by the spongey bounce it had when I pinched it to smoke. I took a few hits. That was all I ever needed. Weed had a weird way of making me feel almost like I was tripping on acid or something. It wasn’t always like that, but once I started getting hard into heroin and meth and everything else, I got weird when I smoked.

The joint Victor gave me put me there. I opened the notebook that I’d found in the attic at the job. The second story started with the title, “My Boy.” It was written in a different color ink than the story about the cabinetmaker and slightly different handwriting. It went like this:

*His mother, my wife, left in a cab at six on a Wednesday morning.* *Some of her friends from college had booked rooms at a hotel in Mexico.* *They had big plans to do the same thing they’d always done since college, drink wine, smoke pot and laugh like idiots.* *There was also a conference showcasing works by artists from across Mexico.* *That was the kind of thing my wife loved to do, so two weeks before the planned date they called my wife to see if she would be able to make it.* *We talked about it.* *Things had been stressful. I gave her the credit card, and she booked a flight on the computer.*

*While she was out of town, my boy asked me if his friend, James, could come over. I agreed.* *They’d been friends since middle school and even though they went to different high schools they remained close.* *It was Saturday morning besides.*

*I liked James a lot, but he wasn’t like my son.* *His mother went through men like they were socks.* *His father was the same with women as his mother was with men, but he also had a habit of going to jail for assaulting them.* *He’d been charged with different kinds of corporate and governmental fraud over the years, and everyone in town knew it.* *James was the spitting image of his father, charismatic and funny and talented but dishonest.*

*I caught them snorting meth a month or so before that.* *They always smoked weed which I was okay with for the most part, as long as my son wasn’t smoking it before noon and took care of business.* *Meth and heroin and things like that, though, were another story.* *I’d freaked out when I found them passing a rolled-up dollar bill and leaning over an old wooden chess board to snort lines of a crystalline powder.* *I’d watched through a crack in the door before I busted in.*

*It scared me.* *When I was young, all we had were cross tops or black beauties, which were bad enough, but I knew that methamphetamine was worse.* *I screamed like crazy.* *I sent James home that night.* *It was always embarrassing to unleash my temper like that in front of my son’s friends, but it wasn’t the first time.* *I talked to him.* *I tried to make him understand that I cared too much to not be terrified at the idea of what that stuff could do to him.*

*My mother-in-law needed to go to dialysis on Saturday afternoon.* *My wife usually took her mother to her dialysis appointments, but since she was gone, I’d promised to take her.* *And that morning, James was already over at the house.* *Things seemed to be well.* *The boys insisted on me giving them work for some money, so they could go to the movies and see some friends later that afternoon.* *I had reservations.* *Finally, I told them I’d give them 50 bucks to clean up about three years of magnolia leaves on the side of the house.* *They ran downstairs, grabbed a box of trash bags and went to work.*

*I watched from the porch for a minute.* *My son picked up a pile of leaves.* *James had a bag opened and held out towards the pile, but when my boy tried to throw the pile into the bag, maybe 50 cockroaches popped out of the soggy mess of leaves.* *There were cockroaches on their faces and down their collars and shirts and pants, a swarm of them.* *The boys spit dramatically and ran away from each other, and it took a minute for them to regroup.* *We all laughed about it, but they got it done.* *They cleaned up a major mess of leaves, which was really a much bigger job than one I could pay anyone else to do for 50 bucks.* *When they’d finished, I was just getting out of the shower and dressed to pick up my mother-in-law.*

*I paid them 50 each for their good work.* *They were filthy and said they’d shower before leaving for the evening.* *When I got back from dialysis, my son was in his room sleeping.* *He must have not stayed out long, or so I supposed.* *James was gone.* *It was suspicious, so I opened the door and listened several times to check in.* *He was snoring soundly at midnight when I finally fell asleep.*

*The next day, I started doing the math.* *If I had come home at 8:30, then he’d have been asleep for at least 12 hours by 8:30 that morning.* *It was 11:30 when I started worrying.* *That was 15 hours of sleep.* *It seemed like too long, and as soon as I opened the door, I knew.*

*Maybe it was the lack of any audible breath.* *Maybe it was a chill in the room.* *Maybe it was the innate sense within my own soul that knew his had departed.*

*The day he was born he weight 8 pounds 3 ounces.* *He cried immediately, and since his mother was out of it from the drugs they’d given her, they handed him to me first.* *He stopped crying.* *His little body wriggled in my arms, and again, there was that innate sense of recognition between us.* *I could tell he knew that I was his father, and that moment changed my life.* *That day marked the rest of my life in away not even my own marriage had, but as I stepped closer to the bed on that Sunday morning, there was no movement. I thought about the moment he’d asked if James could come over. I thought about pulling those two 50 dollar bills out of my wallet the day before and handing them over to the boys.* *I thought about his mother.*

*He was my boy.*

*And we buried him.*

The second story in that notebook didn’t feel good. It reminded me of my own father, who was a bastard, but still strong sentiment had been invoked. The weed didn’t help. Life with Gabriella was in general a desperate and miserable affair besides. She was still nodded out and standing up in the kitchen.

I grabbed her phone. There was a number half dialed already in it, probably something Gabriella nodded out in the middle of and forgot about. The number started with a 1-800. I went to her browser and found pictures of myself running across the freeway with that bag.  They were the pictures taken from the back of the Chinese restaurant by that little black guy.

It became difficult to breathe. My heart flipped. My paranoia skyrocketed. There were phases of all the emotion. First, I couldn’t even think. There was just anxiety pouring through my veins like acid and strangling me. Then, I sat up. I decided that if the cops were coming, then there wasn’t anything to do about it. They’d come and get me. I’d serve my time. It couldn’t be any worse than life with Gabriella, but then, I wondered if she’d even got a phone call off. If she was nodded out and left the meatballs burning on the stove and the number was only halfway dialed.

I looked back at her phone and smoked a cigarette. It showed me walking out of Home Depot from the security cameras. And a different security camera outside of the store showed me coming up off my feet to clock that loss prevention guy. The rest of the photos were of me fleeing across the freeway and the cars wrecking.

The article was short. It talked about the Home Depot employee being listed in critical condition with trauma to the head and those who had been in the car wrecks had suffered minor injuries. There was a large reward for information that lead to my capture. I pulled on my cigarette. The nicotine laden smoke rolled over the back of my tongue and sank into my lungs. This was no big deal. If I kept her plenty high and supplied until we could get out of town in the Focus, it would be okay. I would ditch her somewhere after all of that.

Gabriella remained stuck in that position in the kitchen but for the slight bounce of her body waking up for a millisecond and nodding right back out. I walked past her. In the bedroom, sleep came easy. A terrible vision woke me up in the middle of the night.

Across from the bed right in my line of sight was myself but not just myself. You know the way dreams make characters out of weird blends of the different people in your life, like someone in your dream might be your third-grade teacher and your mom simultaneously, and its hard to tell where or when they or if they even are divided from each other in your dreams? The vision I saw was half of myself and half Rufus, but the evil orange glow of the eyes and voice belonged to something else entirely. Something from somewhere else. My head had been severed, and the figure held it by the hair so that it could address me. He spoke.

“Clyde? You’re going to let her do that to you?”

“I guess.” My lip quivered. The image was terrifying.

“She was going to turn you in! Where’s the Clyde I know? Where’s Boom Boom? Has he gone soft?”

“N-n-n-n-n-o-o. Boom Boom?” I had forgotten all about the nickname. My life on the streets with Rufus existed lightyears from where I was then in that bed at Gabriellas. Now I was soft. The evil entity speaking to me from the dark was right.

“You let her fart in your mouth?” It was true. I remembered. I hadn’t told you yet, because I was embarrassed about it. But I’ll spare the details of what exactly we were engaged in that allowed her to squeeze one of those wandering ghosts out of her wheezy colon and directly into my mouth. You can probably guess. Whatever that was talking to me though, he already knew.  “She farted in your mouth Clyde.”

“What am I supposed to do?”

“I don’t know. Here’s an idea.” With its other hand, the figure pulled a 2x4 with seven or eight nails sticking out one end of it. It was a crudely fashioned murder weapon. “I’ll leave it here for you.”

Winter sunlight coming into the room the next morning gave me some peace. The vision of the man holding my head and talking to me from the netherworld about murdering Gabriella was just a dream. I could go about my day. My imagination had gotten the best of me, but when I pulled my jeans off the chair across from the bed, the chair the evil being had been sitting in, a 2x4 fell from behind it. There were nails through the end of it. I slipped my pants on in the kitchen.

Gabriella was stuck in the same position. That was a long nod. I figured she must have had some benzos or something, but before I woke her up and talked her into leaving town in a hurry, I pinched the fold of bills in my pocket. It should have been 200 for the drills plus another 130 after working with Vic the day before. It was enough to get us high and out of town.

“GABRIELLA!”

She startled. She stood up and screamed at me for a minute but didn’t make any sense. I held the cash in front of her and said,

“Let’s get high. I wanna get out of town.”

“Why?”

“Baby. It’s just time. I got some hook ups down in Florida. We can get some good stuff and live the good life on white sand beaches.” It was a lie. I knew no one in Florida, but the sands were white, at least in some places.

“Are you sure?”

“Yeah, babes. Let’s just get 100 bucks worth today. I’ll put some gas in the Focus. We’ll bust out of town, baby. It’ll be great. Just you and me. What do you think?”

“Hmmm… I guess. I haven’t been on a road trip in a while. It would be nice.” She was still wiping her eyes. Gabriella was usually sweetest before she did any heroin in a day, so long as she knew some was coming quickly. “I’ll call Dominic. He’s up early and has good stuff. Do you have my phone?”

“Okay. Yeah. Here it is. Before we go though, I gotta see my sister. I’ll call her on the way to Dominic’s. Maybe we can meet her at Wendy’s or something.”",1532578033.0

I have been thinking (always a perilous activity) and hope to gain some feedback about an idea I will be trying out.

So, I love Oxycodone and my preferred ROA is insufflation. 

I have in my possession; 1g (1000mg) Oxycodone powder (almost pure), 1 empty nasal decongestant bottle (50ml/1ml metered dose) and distilled water. 

What I am going to attempt to make is Oxy (monkey water) that will provide me with 50x20mg/ml doses. 

Im attempting this for ease of uses/covert use/because I'm bored. 

If I mix 1000mg of Oxycodone powder with 50ml distilled water, add it to my dispensing bottle and re seal it, should that be job done?

I could totally pull something out of my ass as to why it's taking so long for me to get sick and probably be at least on the right track, but I'll turn it over to you all for an answer that would be anything more than a guess. Just really curious why this is so different. It's surreal to me that I'm not in agonizing pain or sweating yet.

The only reason I've thought about dope is because it feels weird *not* being high for three days, not due to cravings related to sickness. The thought came and went and I feel fine again. Last time I tried kicking, I didn't get very sick at all. I had some methadone for the first time then took suboxone when I started feeling a tiny bit uncomfortable later on.

Your mom was sitting on my bed, watching as I busted down a pill and begging me to give her a line. Your dad was in my living room and had cut her off since you would be arriving in a few weeks. We all suspected your mom was still snorting oxy, but she always denied it. She had tears in her eyes, pleading with me for just one bump, saying that your dad cut her off cold turkey. She promised me she hadn't touched anything else, as I heard that she used to pop Xanax all day long before I met your parents a couple months prior. That moment was the first time I failed you. Knowing that cold turkey withdrawal was not good for a fetus, I caved in. Your mom agreed to keep it our little secret. She stood up from my bed, eager to grab the straw from my hands, her eyes focused on the size of powder I was pushing to the side for her, when I saw you move. Her entire stomach shifted from left to right. I placed my hand on you, amazed at how strong your movements were and how quickly you danced around in her abdomen. 

I remember the first time I met you. At two weeks old, you were absolutely beautiful. My puppy laid at the bottom of the swing you slept in, guarding you like you were the most important thing on this earth. And to your parents, you should have been. I brought you over a small gift, as I assumed people do when meeting a new baby girl. Your mom tossed it aside after peeking in the bag. I got to hold you tight on my chest as you slept, in awe of just how beautiful you were. Your dad had gone on a run with my boyfriend, making a couple bucks off of our habit, but I was more excited to meet you and asked to stay home with your mom instead of tagging along like I usually would. You had that new baby smell, I breathed it in until it was overpowered by the smell of cold air and cigarettes. It was middle of winter, but your mom needed a smoke break after hiding the plate she used to snort her lines off of under her bed. Instead of speaking up as she opened up the bedroom window to blow her smoke out as you sat six feet away from her, I kept my mouth shut. Fear of pissing her off, I failed you again. 

Over the next couple months, we met a handful of times. Never for too long as we saw your parents mostly for one reason only. You were growing so quickly, a chunky little thing who had learned to smile pretty early. At three months old I saw you one night. We met your parents at a local gas station for my brother in law to meet up with your daddy. Your dad was slurring his words, barely able to keep his eyes open. We asked what he took, he mumbled something incoherently about how many bars he had left. My BIL walked over to the car. Your mom was slumped with her head between her legs, cigarette in her hand. He tapped on the window and she shot up, hiding the cigarette quickly because you were in the backseat. Bundled up to fight the cold air at 11 at night, we did our best to not fail you that night. We called your aunt to pick you up and take you home. We waited in the cold until she came for you, angry that we were getting involved. I got home that night and cried for you. I cried to my boyfriend the next day, worried about you. We went back and forth weighing the pros and cons of getting child services involved. Your parents lived with your grandparents, so we knew you would always be well taken care of as long as you were under their roof, but that wasn't enough. They couldn't watch you 100% of the time. They didn't stop your parents from taking you out all night while they drove around dropping off orders. 

But I never called. I have no excuse for failing you. I single handedly could've changed your fate sweet girl. I wonder today what could have been different if I had. Would there have been an intervention? Would you be in a better, loving home? Would your parents have gotten clean? 

The story given to family and friends was SIDS, but I was told what really happened the night you left this earth. I hope you know you were loved by your family. I hope you know you were loved by distant friends such as us. I hope your last moments of life were nothing but comforting. I know you were asleep in your parents bed, I know they both were high on Xanax and god knows what else that night. I know that they blame themselves for your death, as I blame myself for not doing my best to make sure you were safe. I still think about you all the time, I look into my own baby's eyes and think of yours. How you deserved better, you deserved longer. You deserved to be protected. You deserved to be safe. You didn't deserve to leave this earth after only spending four months on it. You didn't deserve parents who prioritized a nod over their newborn. 

I'm so sorry I failed you sweet girl. ",1532543412.0

So, I have read that the -azole class of antifungal drugs is an extremely potent CYP450 inhibitor, thus one would would think it therefore is an opiate potentiator. Even my pharmacist warned me of mixing this with my Rx oxy and highly recommended that I reduce my dosage as it increases blood concentration levels. This excited me in that my Rx allotment is extremely minimal and I already had been seeking out the best ways to stretch it as I do indeed have an unfortunate tolerance. 

Tried this combo today, and much to my dismay, I actually felt a DECREASE in effects of my daily dosage. I feel like I took nothing at all, hours later. Needless to say, I’m not happy about this. I read somewhere online that though CYP450 inhibitors may increase blood levels and leave the drug in your system longer - that they, on the other side, reduce the amounts of feel-good metabolites? Does anyone know anything about this? As a newbie to potentiators (I’ve only tried DXM thus far, which also didn’t do shit), what should I try next?? I’ve read about Tagamet but it seems that operates on CYP450 as well? Is my body just weird? Kind of really determined to feel this stuff again without having to go through extreme measures to get more. 

Thanks so much for any insight!!

So yesterday I got prescribed Codeine by my doctor, came home and took 120mg and fuck all happened after an hour. so i took another 3 pills to make it 190 and all that happened was i was incredibly itchy...

I realise this is a weakass drug in comparison to other opiates, but my tolerance won't be anything now, and thus I should still get high right? what can I do to get a ""good""/ ""intense"" high? is there anything I can take it with (OTC)?

Also it was to be right after we got off work.  We didn't want to but then he offers us a 16th. Of course we hastily agreed but wanted to know how/why he was offering so much. Well, he says he's going to reup off the plug and there may be a chase and there was a very small chance of gun play. The plug is high enough up that he's got 10+ guys who work under him and he always carried s gun and was known to follow through on violent thrrstd.  

Well I had reservations about this. I have a lot of empathy for way more people than I should but ripping this guy off felt more to me like stealing a candy bar from Wal-Mart than ripping off a real person. I did however worry about how this would all go down and also riding in the hood at 2am. The plan was to trade this guy a fucking bb gun for the ball. No shit, a fucking bb gun. It looked real if you didn't examine it closely or look in the barrel. Also it had almost enough weight. That being said it'd take a fucking moron to go for this. Just the dumbest idiot ever. I said so. I thought we were going way out of our way to, best case scenario, look like the most pathetic of fools.

We got to the spot in the city and these fools keep being so obviously shady. They tried to park on the side of the street instead of the parking lot. Luckily I was able to talk then out of this and more dumb shit. After the typical dboy ""wait a min"" ""almost there"" ""actually meet me at this other place"" he finally got to us. Lo and behold he sent one of his guys! The guy looked new to the world of crime and paranoid and his dumbass got out of his car and walked up to ours. He looked really paranoid and kept looking around. He/his boss had been told he had to get the gun in a bag bc someone in the car couldn't know about the gun. Well, the guy accepted it and the exchange went np. My dumbass cuz still peeled out anyway. I'm certain this guy wasn't going to check the gun out any time soon. He was just an errand boy. We made it away and cuzs friend got many pussies texts and calls but he gave us half of the very short ball and it's good quality ecp.

I hate being involved in ripping anyone off though. Thankfully it was a higher up guy or a civilian. I hope the poor errand boy didn't get reprimanded too harshly. We're otw home now. How's everyone else night?

Just wanted to vent about my poor, dear friend. He just OD'd a few weeks ago and didn't make it. He was the smartest guy I ever knew, a genuine genius - without a doubt could've gotten a PHd in Maths / Physics (but prob Maths) from any university in the world - just didn't care to take that path (think *Good Will Hunting*). He came top of his school (academically the best school in our city of 2 million) while being drunk as fuck for his final exams. He went to university for a semester or 2 but decided to drop out to be a game designer for about $100k as an 18 year old about 20 years ago ... so shittons of cash.

His younger brother (of 3 in total), who had a few demons in the head, OD'd and died about 10 years ago. He was a sweet kid, but we teased him and were unkind to him when he was younger. I'm so sorry.

His youngest brother was a little scamp who made everyone smile. Perhaps led astray by his brothers, perhaps on his own, he became quite keen on the drugs and died of an OD about 3 years ago. He had a young son.

I'm just sad is all and wanted to tell the cliff notes of this sad tale. I feel so sad for their parents, what more do they have to live for? Poor people, they had everything, plenty of $$$ (I mean plenty), 3 brilliant sons, respect in the community; and now it all has gone.

sorry for repeating these nightly but we opiate enthusiasts have the memory of a goldfish so people need nightly reminders. here you are.  

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job. ",1532490506.0

I decided on the first day off the coke, I'd do a little dope cotton shot at like 7-8pm and do a proper shot tomorrow.

Only, my cotton shot was insanely potent. 

So potent, I fucking OD'd.

Only, it took my a few minutes. I untied and rushed downstairs to do chores. I washed a plate and my girlfriend's mom said something to me (she was over) and I realized something was terribly, terribly wrong.

I couldn't see.

I could hear her words but it was just babbled nonsense. The *whomp whomp whomp* you get in your ears with a rush was overpowering. 

I thought it had been 10 minutes. It was less than 15 seconds. 

I knew I couldn't just die in the kitchen. I had to get upstairs.

""I'll be back,"" I stuttered, not even looking at her mom. I clawed my way up the stairs as fast as I could. I threw myself in my bed. I nodded off.

My gf knew something was up when I didn't come back down, so she woke me up. I could hardly think or swallow or breathe. She pulled my head up out of the sheets and said: ""you seem like you need a back rub.""

that was the best fucking back rub of my goddamn life. I had her stabbing me with her elbows so hard it left mtherfucking bruises. She rubbed my back lotion and all for 2, 3 hours. I remember 30 seconds of it.

The resulting back pain and migraine were amazing at work the next day.",1532479282.0

And I've come to a point where I need to quit again. I've already quit multiple times and relapsed but this time I really wanna quit for a good amount of time. 

My question is... I have the ability to get 8mg Suboxone strips, or ZUBSOLV 5.7 mg/1.4 mg. I've never heard of zubsolv before but I've read a few things online saying that it's just as good as Subs if not better. I plan on buying around 5-10 of one of these and they are gonna be $20 a pop so I want to make sure I'm getting the best one I can.. I've taken subs before to quit my first 2 times, although it was the 8mg pill rather then the strip and I had good success with that. But I was hoping someone here may have experience with both... Which one should I get so that I can get back on my road to recovery? 

Idk if this info is necessarily needed but I am smoking about 1-1.5g of tar every day. Any help would be appreciated cuz I'm ready to kick this habit again.",1532459263.0

Only problem is I hate waking up all groggy and still tired, which happens when I take anything to help me sleep (melatonin, promethazine, amitriptiline, etc). Will taking 3 clonidine with an 8mg sub help me sleep? Just want some relief for when I can't get any pills lol. Any help is appreciated.",1532456162.0

If anyone could help I’d appreciate it SO much. Even if they’re not shorts as long as they’re not the really long ones. The only veins I can hit are my hands. My arm veins are severely scarred from reusing old rigs.
