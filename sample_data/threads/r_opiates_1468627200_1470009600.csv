In most cases I have seen, the addict is the one who is broken up with, but I am curious how common this is? 



I was not an addict starting off in the relationship but always held drugs as a more important thing in life than her. In retrospect it wasn't a very healthy relationship but she loved me. I had to end it due to personal stress caused by her expectations. I was the one who had good credit and found us an apartment, I drove and she did not. I was faithful through out save my affair with opiates that began after our problems did. I regularly cleaned the house, cooked dinner, planned dates, bought gifts, back rubs hair brushes etc.


 After I time I told her I of my drug abuse.. which we did drugs together, don't get me wrong. She would split an oxy with me occasionally or we would take acid together. She really liked molly, xanax and cocaine. I always loved acid and opiates. For some reason I was always put to blame for the stress in our relationship because of the stigma with opiates, but she wouldn't admit that she had a problem with uppers/benzos. I was forthcoming with the fact opioids where a huge influence on who I was on the other hand. When I broke up with her due to her not accepting any blame and being generally abusive.(really was bad but won't go into detail) She insisted on staying in our apartment even though I made it clear i could no longer love her.(we were both on the lease,).


At this point my use skyrocketed to about 4 times a day very quickly and I would simply nod out all the time to pretend like I wasn't around her and also my other MOOCH roommate. They constantly competed for my attention and complained about the lack of effort from the other in terms of cleaning and blah blah. I know this is a long post but I am drunk so i guess whatever?



 my choice to end it has ultimately helped me. I just recently moved from the southeast to the midwest(Northern CO) for multiple reasons including to distance myself from her. I'm sure we all know love is a powerful thing even when the person you love is total shit to you.  a change of ROA coupled with being away from that stress has lowered my use to relatively low levels with extremely less depression on my "" sober"" days. (also partially attributed to less ease of access, i.e; waiting for the mail.)


My point is even though I was an addict I feel I was the most functional person in the relationship and I don't think being an addict means that you are doomed to be without love. Is there anyone out there who is in a meaningful relationship whom is also an addict? Do you think love cannot exist with drug addiction?

3) Is it safe? (Kinda ties into #2)
4) Is it safer/better to order from a Domestic Vendor?

I get paid next week, and I am battling what to do.

I know that I hit (got blood in the syringe and I felt it almost immediately), but my first question would be, how long after injecting would I fall out if I was going to?

I'm not super concerned about an overdose this time because I did a pretty small amount. My second question would be, how long should I wait to do more either by snorting it or injecting it?

My last question is: if I do decide to shoot again can I use the same vein? My next dose will be my last for about a week because I'm all out of dollars, which is part of the reason I shot it, because I couldn't get much tonight and wanted to actually feel it.

Feel free to call me an idiot or answer the questions,.I appreciate the input either way and I know how dumb of a move I just made,  but I made my mind up and did it just for tonight.

woke up today after only 2-3 hours light sleep (you know how bad sleep is on heroin) and this panic attack built up. i had it happen few days already but this was worse. reminded me of really bad hospital trip panic attack i had cpl years ago, which the memory of reliving it made it worse and worse. I have PTSD from how bad it was. 

i managed to down 1mg of xanax and chew it up, thank fucking god, and  it was all i could do to get my shoes on and get outside and start running. i made it to a gulley spot just off the road where  i was hidden from cars and sat. and my brain. god my mind would not stop going, thinking nonsensical things at 300 miles a second. just weird unconnected thoughts. i cannot explain. had my finger on my neck pulse the whole time and was trying to breathe but when i realized i was hyper ventilating i forced myself to slow down. i tried to close my eyes. it made it worse. i tried to count to 100. it made it worse. then i finally stared at a piece of grass and took the longest slowest breathes imaginable, held them in for the longest most frightening 4seconds and then exhaled or 4 seconds, something i read online about managing stress and panic naturally. and it didnt work right away. i felt my body getting hotter and hotter and my pulse going faster and faster but slowly... by breath 10... it was levelling off.. by breath 20 i was almost ok... and then finally i was ok. 

it was soooo scary. i cant explain. it felt like i was losing my mind. my brain wouldnt stop going....



ive had these all my life since i was a little kid. never realized what they were until a few years ago. i get them when i wake up at night. everything looks small and far away and unreal. my mind works 300mph saying insane disconnected things that dont feel like my thoughts. i cant believe thats what these are, panic attacks and depersonalization, derealizqtion. enough to put a guy in the mental ward.

and now im back drawing up a shot... for some god damn relief..


got 7x40mg methadone tabs coming in the mail soon... gonna use them to taper off. i cannot deal with this shit anymore. today was too much.  if that xanax had taken any longer to kick in i woulda ran into traffic and thrown myself in front of a bus, it felt like. it was that bad.

Hoping the community here might have some insight, because I am dreadfully alone in this, and I'm in a situation where I can't really shit the bed (figuratively; if literally shitting in my bed is req'd, the hell with it, I'm down).

I can provide more background on request, but I'll try to keep this to the essentials:
- Low grade opiate habit for almost a decade at this point, but only physically dependent in last year or so
- Legit muscular back pain, rx'd 100 7.5mg/250mg hydros; always a little psychologically dependent, but mostly on the abuse/buzz, never in a physical withdrawal situation until about a year ago
- This is one area where I can't give too much info, but you can fill in the blanks; I have an on-demand (3-5 day lag on the supply but it's pretty much always there) source for opiates, first started on ~200mg/30ml acetylfent nasal spray per day a little less than a year ago; when the ban on AF went into place, dabbled with other stuff here or there

So to the issue at hand. Last few months I've been homebrewing 50mg/30ml fent nasal spray. I can easily get some more by early/mid next week, and I've basically been hoarding my hydrocodone for rainy day/withdrawal avoidance.

But I really want to stop the heavier stuff. I know it won't always be there, and I hate being bolted to a fucking spray bottle and worrying if I lose it, break it, can't use it inconspicuously, etc. I know I can get back to a place I want to be at, where I'm either not using, or just taking a couple hydros recreationally at night, or whatever. My social life has completely evaporated, at least partially because I hate drinking and this gives me an excuse not to, but I really just want to be able to unbind myself from the physical dependence, and if I choose to be a hermit then, so be it. 

I went the better part of a decade 'chipping' on pharms, I know I have the self-control IF I can break the physical dependence. So what I'm saying is, I want to stop pretty much, but I'm not in a place where I want to disrupt my whole life to change things when nothing is so out of control that I'm FORCED to. So, not looking for subutex, outpatient, telling my family, my job, etc. I'm really on track in life other than these heavy opes and their downstream effects socially.

All that said, I just ran out of spray and I'm cutting over to hydros. The problem is my tolerance is so much higher than before, the 200 hydros I squirreled away might not be enough to taper me down. Right now I have to take 4 at a time (30mg) to feel normal/good, and that starts to abate after about 4 hours, and at that rate I'm going to burn through them too fast to make it through to my next Rx, which is an issue itself since that'll be enough for just over 3 per day. But I'm also thinking that this is just going to be the first few days coming off the fent spray, which I used willy nilly whenever I felt like redosing, and after which I'll be able to taper the vicodin relatively easily (assuming I have enough).

So with ALL OF THAT, I'm just looking for ppl who have had similar experiences, or at least some sort of frame of reference for how quickly I should be able to taper. I built a taper schedule but it gets super scary because I'm basically guessing and mapping it to what I've got, and while I can take the w/ds if I HAD to, I don't have to. And the temptation to make that call is just fucking enormous unless I'm confident in my plan. And I'm not sure how confident I am in my plan.

Ideally I could just take as much hydrocodone as necessary until I don't feel shitty from the lack of fent, then see where I am as far as supply is and redo the taper schedule from there.

Thanks in advance for any advice you guys could provide. I don't have any friends I can discuss this with, and I can't tell my family, it would just kill them. The truth is things started to spiral after my cousin who was my age that I grew up with OD'd and died out of nowhere, and I just can't burden them with this unless I have no other legit choices.

I've also got plenty of pot and xanax, but I can't really miss work to deal with this. Ultimately I'm afraid I'm just going to reup on fent, hoard another couple months of vics, try again and fail, and repeat until something bad finally does happen. Please help if you can

Words cannot express what they've done for me and how much I appreciate them. Six months ago I relapsed and spent a ton of money and when that ran out started to pawn things. The dirtbag I am in pawned my moms MacBook Pro. Well this morning she realized it and we went round and round and I just got back from an hour long silent car ride with her to get it from pawn.

After getting my receptors ready with 60mg few days in a row I tried 180mg at early morning hour on an empty stomach. 

I loved the feeling of overall relaxation and warmth. As soon as it started to kick in I could feel the blood directly in my veins buzzing slightly, a bit of stiff neck (both in a quite pleasant way) with random tingling sensations, heavy eyes and bit blurred sight. I was asked to run few quick errands and everything in the streets was pleasantly slowed down, apart from the sun hurting my eyes badly because I forgot my sunglasses. I realized my toothache disappeared completely. 

All that got ruined when the effects started to wear off (unexpectedly sooner than I thought they would) and few hours later I realized I am swallowing the urge to throw up as I was in my friends car and we were going to another city (about two hours drive one way which felt like ETERNITY). She didn't know I was on something, so I tried and pretended that I feel all fine, while in fact I was badly nauseated and very uncomfortable. I felt like fainting several times, I went pale, cold, hot, all at once. I eventually asked her to pull over somewhere and I went out and barfed my guts out. I told my friend it was just a bad case of motion sickness, so she gave me her hoodie to cover myself and let me sleep.

I slept for the rest of the road and when I woke up late in the evening I still felt nauseous, all until I found myself in my own bed begging for the day to be over.

Reflections: Nope. Nope, nope, nope. Either opiates are not for me, or it's just not fucking worth it. I think to myself that maybe I will try again at some point in my life, but when I recall the situation from the car I can physically feel it and it succesfully puts me off even trying ever again.

the purple shit is fire and these 2 brothers have it right now but they aren't the first to have it.  one of my dudes had it like 5 months ago, he had it for a couple weeks then one day i go thru him and he gives me some weird bright white shit that looks like flour.  idk what the fuck it was but it wasn't dope I didn't feel shit from it.  than a day or two later hes like hey got the purple back in, I'm like sweet.  so i get it and i can tell that it's the same white shit that he just like mixed some purple kool-aid in or something.  fucking asshole.  ""awe bro I didn't touch it, that's how I got it from my people.""

then like a month later another completely unrelated dope boy starts having the same exact purple shit. he had it for a couple weeks then he ran out and now hes in jail for manslaughter.

now these two brothers have had it for a minute.

but why are completely different un-related dudes gettin this same purple shit at different times?  u think this shit would be coming from the same source??

and i mean......all the dope other than that purple has been straight garbage.  even when it looks and smells like fire ass dope it's garbage.  and 1/4 of the time the shit looks and tastes fucking weird and nothing like H.

like WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?!?!

why is that shit purple?  where has all the regular heroin gone??/

is this shit all RCs now??

APAP can cause damage(thinning) to your stomach lining which is a direct cause of B-12 deficiency.

Some of you might think it's bullshit but it helped me out. B-12(2500mg) is pretty expensive. It gave me a fuck load more energy as well as a positive mindset. I was in a haze for a little while. When I bought it I thought I just wasted $20 so I know it's not a placebo effect.

This is a great community and I am hoping for some insight here. I have been on sub maintenance for about 5 months now. I only take roughly 4mg a day despite my sub doc prescribing me 8mg a day. 4mg is completely sufficient for me and I am trying to take the least amount of Bupe possible in order to still feel well. 

Well I have gotten to the point where I am ready to start living life without subs and the devil 36hour half life Bupe. I know the WD's are going to be rough so I am asking what are the best ways to get through them? 

One specific questions I have, and this may be ridiculous, is during the probable 15 day WD period would it be helpful to take a few pain pills every day to mask  the Bupe WD? Would say taking a couple Hydros or Oxy or whatever it may be during the Bupe WD period not make me feel sick? Is a plan of doing that and then when the Bupe is out of me say after 21 days feasible? I know I would be a little sick from the pain pill WD after this period but that would be much better than the full blown 15 day Bupe WD. If this is a ridiculously stupid plan that will not work please let me know. Are there better alternatives? Thank you all in advance. ",1468782743.0

So I came here and looked over the chart and did some math.. so diacetylmorphine is aparently 4x stronger than hydrocodone? Right.. so if let's say someone does one point shots. So 100mg of diacetylmorphine.. would you have to take 40 pills to gey the same effect? Since one Norco is 10mg right.. so 40x is 400mg.. that already seems insane. Well I suppose. Dope is dope after all were not dealing with simple pharms anymore. But I also realized hydro is 30% bioavailable orally.. so I did some more math.. 30% of 400 is 120.. so if you take 40 pills youre only getting 120mg of hydro? Correct me if im wrong so far.. but wouldnt that mean you'd have to take x4 of that then.. since to achieve the same affect you need 400mg of hydro.. so if you're only getting 120mg out of 40 pills.. then you'd have to take something around 120 pills.. that would equal out to 360mg.. this seems insane. And I'm sure my math is waaaay the fuck off. But theres no way 120 pills is equal to one point of dope. Right? Someone help me out i have literally never messed with pharms besides maybe twice so I have no experience with it. But there's no way 120 pills is a correct dose.. that would kill someone.

What do?,"Originally posted in r/drugs because I wasn't shooting opiates but someone there said this sub might know better.

So I last night I injected a shot into one of the veins in the crook of my left arm. The only clean equipment I had access to was way bigger gauge than what I'm used to, but I had successfully shot with that size a few times already. I don't usually shoot into the veins in the crooks of my arms because they make such obvious track marks (I'm not a frequent user and most of my friends don't know about this), but with the bigger needles I did, because it's generally the safest place to inject (bigger veins and less nerves near them). Flagged, shot, watched closely for swelling (none), no pain either.

So anyway, about three hours later the index finger of my left hand started hurting. That was quickly followed by stiffness and tingling. When I was pulling the needle out after injecting, I did notice that I may have accidentally pushed it deeper than I had intended (easy when the needle is twice as long as what you're used to) so it's possible that some of the solution ended up outside of my vein. The site of the injection wasn't (and still isn't) red, raised, warmer than its surroundings or sensitive/painful to touch. The elbow was occasionally hurting in the joint pain kind of way, same as the index finger. The stiffness and tingling gradually spread to other fingers too. Full mobility and no clear source of pain in the whole arm apart from the joint pain. In the past, I have had pain in my elbows and wrists after injecting, and I have trapped nerves that cause me moderate arm pain anyway, so I'm pretty good at ignoring that, but the stiffness and tingliness is what got my attention.

I'm pretty sure that this is at least partly caused by the solution that didn't get into the vein but stayed to hang out in my elbow. I'm not sure if there are any nerves or tendons on the vein side of the elbow, though, and in total there was only a little over 1ml of solution injected! I may have also accidentally pushed the needle past the vein at some point during the injection and done an unintentional IM shot. I'm more careful than the average IV user and I've read up on this quite a lot since I started (about two years ago), but I'm not very sure what's going on here.

As first aid, right after shooting, I ran hot water over my arm for a minute (I remember reading somewhere that you should do this after missed shots to increase blood circulation so as much of the foreign agent as possible would move away from the area). I slept with my arm raised but I'm not sure if that made any difference. When I woke up, the symptoms seemed to be gone, but soon the stiffness and tingling returned, milder than last night, but still. I held an ice pack to the injection site for a while (also something I've read somewhere, later stage first aid for missed shots) to reduce possible swelling that might be putting pressure on something inside my arm and causing these issues. My elbow is still mildly hurting. Only the index finger is stiff and tingly anymore. Typing doesn't hurt as much as last night. I've been taking ibuprofen to ease a possible infection.

So I know that I might have nerve damage, and that I should go get it checked out. The thing is, the healthcare system doesn't know that I do drugs, and at the moment, I can't really afford to tell them (it's complicated, but shortly put I might be denied medical treatment that I desperately need if they knew about this, and medical professionals don't usually see IV users as moderate users). I'm pretty much set on just waiting it out - these symptoms are rather mild, and people seem to have just ignored stuff worse than mine and still turned out fine. I know that no matter how careful I've been, I might still have fucked up in a way that requires medical attention. I just really, really don't want to see a medical professional about this. There's a harm reduction center in my town that lets you be an anonymous client and offers ""doctor's services"" so I might go check that out tomorrow if it hasn't passed by then.. Though I don't think they can do much more than antibiotics, and I don't even know if there is an infection. I'm not a frequent user - the last time I shot was in December - so I'm not super familiar with their services.

Does anyone have similar experiences? Or some idea of what's going on here? Help appreciated.

Hello everybody, it's a me street platypus!!! Fash reached out to me and encouraged me to make a post cuz when people from our little corner of the world suddenly drop off most times it means they are dead.  And that's pretty far from the case for me currently.  

Today will be my 118th day of complete sobriety.  I also quit smoking about 2 months ago as well. Iv got a full time job and while it's not the greatest it's still the first job Iv had on paper in about 3-4 years.  Iv got a bank account that isn't in a constant state of radical flux and I am Able to eat regularly.  Iv gained some weight and no longer look like I am going to die.  I'm actually pretty sure that I could win a street fight now, so look out world!  I had a girlfriend but that shit was moving way too fast for me (trying to keep it real casual right now aka casual sex only) so I had to end it.  I'm saving up for a car and I will hopefully be able to make that happen by the end of the summer.  

I'm looking into going back to school because I need too.  Probably just one class at first (something philosophy related) to see if I can even exist in the school world because it's been so long since Iv ever tried too.  And taking inspiration from u/oxyjay Iv been working towards doing open mics for stand up comedy because it's something Iv always wanted to at least try.  Iv also been writing and making music and just art in general.  I think that being able to creat art without needing to be fucked up is what I am most grateful for.

I guess the biggest change is that mentally I feel like a new person.  Iv still got issues but I am more willing to work towards solving them in a positive and healthy way instead of trying to dopefiend my way around them.  I don't actively or passively want to die either which is amazing after a 29 year run of being pretty apathetic about waking up.  I don't know if it's because of finally taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin) or my IOP (hey IOP councilor, I know you lurk here and are reading this) or because it was just my time.  I can definitely say that being on drug court has definitely helped to Motivate me and keep my on track.  I just phased up to phase 2 and my POs like me.  But why wouldn't they? I am honest and forth coming to a fault and am doing everything I'm expected to do and more.  

I goto anywhere from 3-5 12 step meetings and I have a pretty chill sponsor.  And what I value the most about those meetings is the network Iv built and the people I see there.  Of course there's drama and politics in the rooms and most of it is embarrassingly juvenile but I just don't get caught up in it and neither do the people I chill with.  I don't know if I buy the entire program but I know, for myself, it has helped me immensely.  And if what's keeping you from trying them out is the whole ""God"" thing then my advice is too just  give it a try because the rooms are full of people with the same hang ups.  

I wish I had like some sort of blueprint I could share with you guys of the definitive way to get healthy but I don't. My journey so far has been lllloooonnnggg and tumultuous and has only just begun. 4 official ODs and countless ODs without official medical intervention,  arrests etc.  Iv been beyond lucky and people who were a lot better than me were not and I don't have any sort of explanation for that.  At the very least Iv made progress and have hope that I can make more.  

And I still think about drugs but that's changed too.  I find myself not wanting to forget how it felt to be high but at the same time not glorifying it at all.  Or when I see someone nodding put it doesn't make me at all envious because while I do remember the warm euphoria i also remember the near constant desperation I felt in that world.  And I probably only spent like 2% of my time in addiction high or satisfied.  And while that 2% was pretty nice it didn't make the other 98% worth it.  

And I'm Sorry to anyone out there who cares that I ghosted on this place.  It was instrumental in keeping me from killing myself for the last 2 years of the darkest period of my life.  When I couldn't leave my bed you guys were here providing me with enough social connection and love to keep me from doing something stupid.  But Ever since Shana died this place just hasn't been the same
For me.  There have been a lot of deaths here that Have effected me but hers really fucked me up.  We were very close, texting or talking all day every day.  And when she banged out I just couldn't allow myself to have to experience that again.  I am still experiencing it and I'm Not sure if I want it to stop.  

I never though that I wouldn't feel connected to the majority of the subject matter in this sub but currently I'm just not about that life.  From my perspective as a long time poster and current occasional lurker Iv noticed that nothing here really changes.  It's essentially almost the same posts week after week.  People cycle in and out and addiction or use or whatever you want to call it never changes.  People die, fent warnings and everyone's always either waiting in parking lots or experiencing warm
Fleeting feelings.  It's a bummer.  

BUT I love you all and if I can ever help in anyway I'm out here in NJ holding it down.  So PM me, FB me or contact me in whatever way is currently possible for you.  

Be good and be kind.

I normally got them from $33 ( i kno its a off the wall number but my normal guy is always straight n in the area so I carry 1's with me like a stripper) so the way i looked at it i was saving $39 cuz i usually get 3 at s time.... well 10 min later I had the pills in my hand and popped a full 1 n half of 1 and i instantley felt disaponted in myself. it happened so fast that I didn't have time to think about all the hard work i had put into getting clean n staying clean. I love u guys n kno there's no judgement here but damn I messed up. I'll prolly take the other 1.5 tomorrow n head to work and then block this dude's number so i won't know when he text me.

Before I start I want to remind you that all of us are junkies and do stupid shit to get high/avoid being sick so casting judgment isn't only hypocritical but extremely annoying. 

And yes I know I should have just taken suboxone but I didn't have insurance and the money to spend $200 a month.

I was at work doing what I always do. Earlier in the morning I took my usual handful of loperamide like I do everyday to avoid being sick and miserable. I was on a phone call when my vision started to blur. Next thing I new I was on the floor surrounded by my coworkers and paramedics. They put me in the ambulance and took me to the E.R. where I had another episode of cardiac arrest. 

Over the course of 2 days I had met the defibrillator 5 or 6 times. They had to put a catheter in through my groin into my heart to keep it beating at a normal pace. There is no damage to my heart, I guess what happened is the electrical signal my brain is supposed to provide to my heart just wasn't working properly with the lope in my system and it wanted to kill me. It stays in your system 9 days supposedly so I'm still at risk of a attack. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD. They told me that someone came in a couple of weeks ago and died on the operating table when they tried to put a catheter in him. 

This is a problem that's going to come.... and hard. If you are taking them stop now. I feel it is my responsibility to spread awareness because there were 0 warnings my heart was going to stop and it happened completely unexpectedly. 

Please people. This has traumatized me. I died 3 times and if I can save one person from doing the same I can sleep well tonight. Spend the money on subs. Or heroin. Or even fucking methadone! Loperamide will kill you. You may think you are different and it won't effect you you are fucking stupid. If you continue to take them you will surely die. Just stay the fuck away from those little devil pills.

I have to change names and alter information for legal reasons. That said, this isn't written to tell my story, clear up any events, or muddy the truth. This is written for entertainment purposes only. And I suppose as a warning.

My phone beeps at 10am. Money texted me ""is Diego on?""

I kinda grumble to myself, purposefully annunciating only the ""fucks"" and ""shits.""

""Yeah, why? Is C not answering? Or did you fuck him over finally?"" I text back. I lay in bed with my phone held up over my head, awaiting a response.

""Both I guess. Long story. Can we meet?""

""Yeah man, its early though. I'm still in bed. Diego is working til 5 anyway. I don't wanna drive out there."" 

""Oh shit, do you know anyone else on? I'm getting sick. Or do you have a shot for me?""

""Isn't your tar lady working? All I can get right now is tar man, and hers is better anyway.""

""Yeah I kinda owe her money. Can we drive out to Diego? We can take my truck. Please?""

""Yeah you owe him money too. And me for that matter, fuck. Get it together man.""

""Please? We will just say its for you, and I will pay you out of the dope. Plus you can reup early on my gas. I know you won't fuck with C right now so I don't see any other option.""

""That's cause C isn't selling real dope. He's hot as fuck right now. God damnit. I know you're just going to make Marie go pick up Cs bullshit for you if I don't. Come pick me up in 20.""

I roll out of bed, a thin layer of cool sweat over my body despite the literal arctic air outside. Last nights jeans and T shirt are on the floor, so I give them a sniff. I toss the boxers and free ball it in dirty clothes.

I stumble into the bathroom half asleep. I sit on the toilet and light a cigarette to hang idly in my lips as I fix my shot. Digging in my pockets I find a clean rig, two points of dope and a little shard I saved for morning. Briefly I ponder saving money half a point, but his name has become a misnomer these days. His credit was maxed six weeks ago.

I stand up after my shot, and relight the smoke in my lips. My whole body feels electric as the meth takes over. My breathing gets heavy and I get light headed as my skin begins to tingle. There is a nagging warmth from the smack, but it quickly subsides. The meth overpowers it, and I don't mind.

I empty my pockets onto the counter as I rinse with mouthwash. I count out a few hundred, not enough. Some odd ones and fives. No dope. No clear. Better reup anyway I guess. 

As I rinse my toothbrush my phone dings. Its only been ten minutes. He must have hoped to catch me before my shot. What a twat.

I half bounce out the front door, my coat unzipped so I can feel the arctic air blast against my chest. Little beads of sweat at my temples freeze on the way to his truck. I grin, it feels good.

I hop in, agitated immediately by his begging puppy dog eyes.

""You look well.."" He notices.

""Yep, meth.""

""Meth?""

""Meth.""

His truck groans down the road as I begin to blather on about nothing. Its an hour drive across dead, frozen landscape to meet Diego. I fill it by vocalizing every errant thought. I'm sure.

I text Diego to let him know I'm close. And pretend to absentmindedly add Money is driving. 

""Money is with you? He owes me a bill.""

""Yeah man, I know. I told him you'd be cool, so that you can get a chance to remind him in person you know? Its not for him though, just breaking him off for driving.""

""OK. Whatever. I'm busy anyways I'm not in the shop. My homeboy is gonna take care of you. Tell money he better pay this week or he's gonna get hurt."" 

""Cool be there in 5"" I text back

""What did he say?"" Asks Money

""He said we are good. Someone else is making the drop.""

""He's not mad at me?""

""Idk, maybe he forgot?""

He eyes me sideways. Hes no fool.

We pull up and a very round, young white dude walks up in coveralls. He tosses a fat bag through the window, and I hand off the cash. Without a word he turns around and walks back inside.

""K let's fix."" Suggests money.

""Are you crazy? Here on the rez? Tribal cops are crooked as fuck, if they catch us we don't even have a bribe.""

""Well down the road?""

""Not on the rez.""

""Its cool.""

""Its NOT.""

""Please?""

""Fuck dude! Fine! Let me drive, you can fix on the highway.""

We pull up to his place back in town. The meth is fading away and Im craving a shot. Who am I kidding? I'm always craving a shot. We walk inside and I take my seat on the floor, sitting Indian style before his coffee table. Like always. We bust out the scale and divy up our shares. I notice he neglects to pay me back, but to be honest I prefer him in my pocket. It gives me a strategic advantage over him when I need it.

After our shots we nod out a little. When we wake up its almost 3pm. Our phones are full of texts from people looking to score. We sort out the doubles, and I take the good ones. After a minute I sigh and slink back down to the floor.

""Can't we just get high? Ignore everyone today? Man everyone's been falling out from C's shit, I bet we are hot as fuck right now.."" I say, trying to convince him or me, I don't know.

""Hmm. Yeah. I gotta take care of my friends though. I gotta reup tomorrow you know. Some of us hustle for our money.""

""Yeah me too. I can just give marie what I need to get rid of. She said her phones blowing up too.""

""K. Two peeps are stopping by. Then I'm good til six. Let's go get a pizza when they leave.""

""Yeah.."" I agree absentmindedly, mixing my next shot. ""I need more ice later.""

""You gotta get off that shit. Its bad for your head man.""

Before I fucked it up I had one friend down here (and pretty much one friend in the world) I was really looking forward to reconnecting with. Friend of 12 years, who I'd broken up with years ago and made up with, all water under the bridge. On the way down I was so excited to see her I asked to meet in the mall that same day. I told her everything.

Here's what I thought: oh, it won't be like before where we hang out all the time but we can maybe do the late night diner thing we used to do just once a month, text a couple times a week. Her dark sense of humor and chill in the face of fucked up situations will make it so she gets my situation! She'll be a really positive presence in my life and encourage me to do art like I used to! 

Reality: after I told her everything in the mall she hugged me bye and there was no warmth behind it. A couple days ago I sent her a message on Facebook apologizing for ambushing her at the mall and bringing chaos into her life and asking if we could slowly become friends again. Today I sent her a text asking if she got my message and telling her I understood if she needed space.

Her reply was ""I saw it and I'd appreciate it - space, that is.""

This is fiction, based loosely on true events. This is for entertainment purposes only. This is not written to muddy the truth, tell my story, or complicate legal matters. Its only meant to entertain, and serve as a warning.

I'm sitting in the back seat of the cop car, losing my mind. What the fuck can they prove? Can they keep me in here? Why are these cuffs so tight, and why did officer cockface grab my phone? What the fuck is going on? Is Brandon going to snitch on me? Does that matter, or mean anything? Fuck. Am I gonna be sick in jail? What's jail like anyway? And what will my bond be? Can marie come up with five grand? Is that enough? Or. Oh fuck. Am I gonna have to call my parents for bail? I really doubt they will be sympathetic. I did tell them I'm using again. Maybe my brother and sister will help me out.

After ten minutes of some very intense introspection and circumstantial regret (the worst kind of regret), I see Brandon cuffed and put into the back of a squad car and driven away. The third car drives away too. Its just me and officer cockface. Good. They must be letting me go.

The door opens, and cockface tells me to step out. ""Any weapons, guns, knives, needles on your person? Any drugs or anything else I should know about?""

""I do not consent to a search.""

He stops for a moment, then unzips one of my coat pockets. I twist away slightly, and repeat myself. ""I do NOT consent to a search.""

He opens the zipper completely, and shines a flashlight into my pocket. He pulls out a ziplock baggie with ten or so cleans. Aw shit. Its like that.

""What are these? Any other needles in your pockets? If I get stabbed, I'm not going to be so friendly.""

""This is bullshit.""

He continues his search. He finds the loaded rig and the bindle. ""What's in this?"" He asks. The sight of the loaded rig makes my heart sink. Why didn't I muscle it? Fuck! Fucking Brandan! I was mostly joking about going to jail high. Until today I've maneuvered my way out of everything with law enforcement. Its a new day though.

""...."" I reply, instantly pissed at the whole situation.

""Alright, let's go. Watch your head."" He puts me back into the back seat. Yay! I'm going to learn what jail is like. 

When I get to intake, I recognize the CO at the desk. ""Krew? What did you do?""

""Oh uh.. Wrong place wrong time, you know?"" He smiles.

After my mugshot and everything is taken care of, I'm dressed in a striped jumpsuit and given my mat and blanket. Fuck today. Fuck Money, fuck C, fuck Brandon! I just wanted to get high and cuddle with Marie, and instead I'm going into a cage.

""You wanna be with your friend?"" He asks. 

""He's not my friend."" I decide. Again. Something was fishy about my arrest. I'm not sure it was his fault, but I know something will be before this is over.

""OK, in here."" He says, and I'm in the intake tank.

As the door shuts, the covered form on the floor lifts his head. ""Krew?""

""Aw shit. Joseph. What's up?""

""Oh just living the dream. Ol lady called me in for drinking. Gotta wait a few days for my PO to let me out. What's up with you? Never thought I'd see you in here.."" He trails off as he notices my tracks for what I believe to be the first time. I suddenly realize my double life is over. Its just one life now. Krew the junkie criminal. Fuck..

I hit the button, and am greeted by a not so pleasant voice on the intercom. 

""Yes?""

""Its Krew. Krew Tan. What's my bail?""

""You have felony charges. You will need a judge to set your bond. You will know Monday."" 

Oh. Shit. I do the math in my head. Its about six PM saturday. So by the time I see a judge... Yeah. I'm gonna be a wreck. Fuck! 

Through the night we bullshit as the drunk tank fills up. Saturday night in the Midwest means it will fill up. Come dinnertime, I'm getting sick. I haven't eaten today, and with no dope I'm not hungry. I give Joseph my tray.

Sunday morning the door opens and I'm called out. I'm suspicious as to why. 

""What's going on?"" I ask. The CO puts cuffs on me, and doesn't answer.

I'm led into a room with two plainclothes officers standing. I take the power chair furthest from the door, facing the door. 

""That's his seat.."" One of the detectives says. I just look at him.

""Its fine..""

They sit. I'm mad as fuck right now.

""So we need your help. There's this batch of dope going around, and its bad. Real bad. We've had about twelve overdoses in four days. And your name keeps coming up.."" The younger detective says.

""Weird."" I state.

They smile, fake smiles.

""Well we think you can help us. We know a lot about you. You're not a bad guy. We know you're just a user, maybe you sell-""

""Look."" I cut him off. ""You need something from me. I'm a reasonable guy. I guess my main concern, is that I need something from you. And I don't trust you to hold up your end. I need to collect it in advance.""

""OK, what's that?"" The young one says, leaning in as if concerned.

""A cigarette.""

They look at each other, a little flustered. Its a tall order I know. But I feel like I have a ton of leverage here.

""After you talk to us."" The younger one says.

I laugh. ""You want me to play my hand with no chips? No thanks. I will go back to my cell now."" 

The older one speaks up. ""You aren't here to collect a bribe. This is to save yourself. Get ahead of this thing.""

""Naw. I don't think cops can offer deals. Thats usually the prosecutors job. So what else do you have to give?"" I state bluntly.

""We can tell the prosecutor you helped us. To go easy on you.."" The younger one says.

""Oh?"" I ask. ""I just want a smoke man. Then you can still tell him that. There's a pack of kamel reds in my property. One of those would hit the spot.""

They look at each other and step out of the room. I'm giddy with anticipation. Anticipation over having a smoke, and making some enemies in the police department. I can't believe this is going to work.",1469025700.0

Turns out, using trams/methadone/subs, even only a little, on more of my sober days than not = fucking hell when I actually have to be 100% sober. Physically I'm well enough to function, so maybe I'm just being a whiny bitch, but my whole body hurts and mentally I'm fucked. 
Yesterday was awful, got home and my boyfriend left his shit out. He's just using enought to avoid w/d right now, so I'm not upset with him and wouldn't ask him to suffer just because I am, but GOD it was so hard not to fuck up. I would have if he wasn't around. I almost did when he left briefly. And that's fucked, because I'm 100% sober for a really legitimate reason, so that's really fucking with me. Who the fuck am I anymore? I can't deny that I have a serious problem. I spent two hours yesterday googling ways to fake an injury to score some legal painkillers, even just one, so I have a valid reason to have them in my system. This goes way deeper than I thought. The only thing keeping me going is the fact that I *might* be able to use tomorrow if all goes as planned. One more day. 

Misery loves company, so feel free to join in on the bitching. I'll humor you. I get it. I can't bitch to my boyfriend because he so desperately wants to help me and hates seeing me like this that he
went out and bought us an adorable little new pet last night as a surprise to cheer me up. It worked. So I'll smile and get through this one last day and hopefully be able to use tomorrow (*just this once* of course) and then go back on maintenance meds and continue this vicious fucking roller coaster ride I'm on.

This has been going on for maybe 5 years, every 2 weeks i'd get 3-5 of the big 100ug patches at between £5-10 each (a total steal).   
I always knew she had a terminal disease, and that this wouldn't last forever, but the patches kept coming so I pushed the thought to the back of my mind.   
Today is patch day, so o texted my guy checking we were good and got this reply:  
""No mate they stopped them""  
I completely froze, and over the next few minutes as he explained to me what happened I felt like I was on the verge of having a panic attack.  
Turns out she's got more sick and had to go to the hospital last week, at which point a Dr asked why the fuck she was on such a crazy dose of Fent, and immediately switched her to something else, something that she now needs all of. 

It's over, my run is finished. Sure I can still get gear but it's not the same, a patch could keep me wrecked for a full 24 hours, the nods were so strong I'd wake up with my neck craned back, get more comfortable then be gone for another 30 minutes, and this would last hours if I used them properly!
This is like the feeling you get when you're sick and realise you've been burnt for the last of your cash, that sheer disappointment that's so intense you want to cry, because what else can you do?

I was expecting to get high today so I'm going to get some gear anyway, I know I'll just tear myself apart with cravings if I don't. It just means that rather than being high for 4-5 days, my £40 will last tonight and maybe tomorrow morning if I ration it, and even that's presuming it's good. Oh and let's not forget I've now got to worry about my veins again, fucking brilliant. 

I guess I'll just have to hope they put her back on it... 

*Edit - oh and I forgot, last week they upped my Mdone privileges so I only pick up twice a week. I was expecting to be able to save 5 days of Mdone while on Fent then either get fucked on that or sell it to pay for a couple of patches. Fuck sake!!*

*Edit 2 - She was already on high doses of Fent and OraMorph and a Dr decided to add Tramadol to it. She OD'd, got taken to hospital and that's what sparked the change of meds. I'm glad she's ok, that would have been a terrible way to go...*",1469008781.0

The initial rush after shooting is phenomenal, but once it levels out I'm not all that high. Don't get me wrong, I'll still have a good buzz going on, but I like the overall buzz from snorting better. Am I doing something wrong here, maybe I'm not doing enough to keep a solid buzz after the rush? I know I'm not missing and like I said the rush is amazing.

I know a lot of you are thinking 'great! If you like the snorting high better just go back to snorting'. I may very well do that, the only problem is I have to do so much snorting that its ALMOST not worth it. If I buy $400 worth of dope on Friday (payday) it will all be gone by Sunday and then I'm sick for 2 weeks until I can get paid again. Running out was never an issue because my dgirl would float me til I get paid again, but she is having a change in policy after a few dipshits ripped her off, so now I gotta suffer for someone else's stupidity. Ideally I would like to shoot and make the dope last longer. I understand that in theory this is a good plan, but in reality it won't be long before I'm shooting just as much or more than what I was snorting.

I'm in rock and a hard place.

In summary, does anyone else experience snorting being a better high than shooting after the glorious rush fades? If not, how can I fix this? Doing more I'm sure is the answer, I'm just fairly new to the shooting scene and am somewhat afraid of over-doing it.

All powdery white look with all the usual fent signs. 

That shit is pretty common around here and honestly I didn't care for it or think it was good shit. Sometimes I like the fent dope or straight fent. This kind was the kind that comes back looking like water and leaves a bunch of cut in ur spoon. 

Anyway this dude makes his weekly trip up here and this is what he got. I told him before the shit was not normal dope and was most likely pure fent and to be careful. 15 bucks worth bout killed the poor guy. (I didn't get him the dope)

He did the shot and almost immediately hit the floor. He was out for so long it got to the point where I either try to slam him with a sub or call 911. Before I called them I tried the shot of suboxone. Half a 4 mg strip saved this man's life. You could see the shot kick in within about 30 seconds and he started moaning and shit looked like something out of a movie. Then he woke up and couldn't hear very well he said. Kept having to repeat everything and pretty much yell for him to hear me. He had overdosed the previous trip here also off of some normal dope but that time I was able to smack him for 5 or 10 minutes and wake him up. 

Tldr dude overdosed at my place so I hit him with a shot of suboxone and revived him. Half a 4 mg strip. also fent all over the Lou be careful ",1468962551.0

1. Feel like a child again in interests, empathy and decreased stress

2. Usually more social, but definitely not feeling promiscuous 

3. Pain relief

4. No hangover or poisoned feeling (I never take over 60mg of oxy at one time). 

5. Always want more

**Alcohol**:

1. Feel like a limitless adult. Nobody can fuck with me. More empathetic

2. More social, more sexual (don't like the latter aspect)

3. Pain relief

4. Horrendous hangovers, depression, death feeling (this is really why I don't drink more).

5. Always want more when I'm drunk


**In conclusion**: while there are some marked similarities between opiates and alcohol, the two (obviously) are very different in mechanism and effects. Opiates are therapeutic. They make me feel well. Alcohol is intoxicating and makes me feel wonderful and then horrible and poisoned, with many regrets. I have never done anything regretable while under the influence of opiates; I've acted a fool under the influence of EtOH on many levels (violent, emotional, promiscuous).

The sun has been unforgiving the past couple of days and as I have worked outside I have felt the heat cleanse my soul and force much of the bad that I put in my life out of my body as gallons of water come in and right back out onto the ground having served its purpose. The cleanse is good, it clears my head so I am able to think again.


Of course I haven't thought about my life plans in a while and when my head is clear, as it seldom is, I am forces to think about my life path yet again. I am not very happy with where I am. What I am doing to get by. I always had bigger and better plans, plans to travel, Business ideas, life goals. Now it seems like my goal is to make it through each day. To make it through the fog.


The sun pierces the fog sharply and puts me in the spotlight, a spotlight which illuminates my deepest self. While it is cleansing it also shows me all the darkness and empty depths, broken promises and forgotten dreams that I bury deep within. These things force a cry deep in my soul. A yell for help, please silence these demons I thought I had forgotten.


The sun cleanses, but this also makes one tired and weak for a time being. What can a man do to resist his demons when he is weak and so fully aware of them and their hungers. A strong man would carry on and confront all of his fears and heartaches.
I often wonder if I am strong man when I go through these days of anguish. I try to be strong for my family. For my lover. For my mother and my father. So I can be there for my sister's and l brothers. 
The sun cleanses but the heat can also weigh a man down. 


So here I am sitting in a hot car yet again waiting. While the sun drives sweat and waste from my body.
Trying in vain to cleanse a soul which seems to be destined to dirty itself.
My friend comes back.


We leave.


The sun is going down now, but a gentle warmth is now coming from within. The voices are quiet yet again, but only for now.
When the heat and strain pierces the fog yet again the demons will be only hungrier so.

Yet they are quiet for now",1468946837.0

I've slowly rotated around my body, my feet have just about had it as of this morning. It took me 15-20 minutes to register my very last available vein just below my ankle (or what's left of it... it probably looks like a mangled, chewed up, knotted straw under the skin).

After I scored a half hour ago, I spent the walk to the nearest available public bathroom stall massaging my hands and arms looking for any promising looking bumps. Being the hottest day of the year, my blood pressure is very high and I'm pouring sweat - on top of the hot and cold sweaty flushes!

""Blip!"" My thumb runs over a little bit of skin on my hand that gives then re-inflates. There's no guarantee it will register, but its a place to try anyway.

I walk in the stall, get some water and... speed-run-cookup! The pin is ready to push in under 40 seconds. What an utterly poontless skill to have. Like those speed-cubers that can solve a rubix in under 2 minutes... except there aren't any competitions ranking peoples ability to melt, filter and load smack into a syringe ready to get high. 

I try my bump, aaand... yay! First time register! A slow squeeze... it continues in, no lump forming under the skin so its not a miss, it goes all the way in.

Then...a 5 second pause aaand..my hand and half my arm instantly begin to burn like hell. No, not an artery. I'm just too fast. The syringe hadn't even cooled down from prepping it. D'oh!

Ooh! And the pain fades rapidly and gives way to a nice little rush as warmth spreads through my body. Interesting, its far more than the previous couple of weeks doing.hits. Same gear, same amount. It makes me think, and I conclude that there is but one difference.

So, do shot locations make a difference? From feet all the way to brain, does anything get filtered or are there maybe other receptors that snatch a few loose molecules before they hit the brain?

Has anybody else experienced this phenomenon?

Is there any science to support the madness?

Wow.. 
Happy hottest-day-of-the-year guys! The UK is experiencing a major heatwave today. Phew!


P.s.

There is anecdotal evidence (although, personally, I don't see how this could possibly be true) that set and setting can affect potency too.

A lot of people (and I know this to be true from personal experience) do become actually sick and begun sweating with high heart rate on the way to pick up! Its more than just excitement too, its as if the body knows what's going on and begins to prepare! The excitement is enough to cause a major physiological response.

So, further to that effect, its been said that addicts can overdose away from home or their usual area even on the same amount they usually take due to surprising the body by altering a regular routine. If there is a place that someone regularly uses their drugs, the body may prepare. So, going somewhere new can shock the system if its not ready.

Well.. that's what I heard. I know for a fact that the strength of a good hit can cause intense associations to form between location and effect. It's what affects addicts in their recovery too and can cause relapses - I suppose you could call those associations 'triggers' if you're clean.",1468946302.0
4txk85,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4txk85/it_does_get_better/,15,https://redd.it/4txk85,Waffledown,It does get better,"Quick backstory. I broke my ankle about ten years and and as it goes I picked up a nice new habit to go along with my shiny new plate in my leg. I actually did a pretty good job keeping things in check and would only use on occasion. I thought I had no problem keeping myself in line. Well that lasted until about two years ago when  my occasional usage turned into a nice daily habit as it likes to do.

It was tough because I was doing such a great job being a functioning addict. I finished school, got a good job, met a wonderful girl and things seemed great. The problem was the whole time I couldn't help but feel those weren't my accomplishments but the pills. When I couldn't find anything I became obsessive and lost all of my confidence to do just about anything. Without my opiate friends I had become a shell of the image I had created. Just thinking of the times I lied to people I care about, pissed away thousands of dollars, and ignored real life in the pursuit of my addiction makes me still feel guilty.

Anyways, I finally got to the point where I wanted it all to stop. I got tired of living a lie and throwing my money and time away. Tired of the pain of withdrawals and losing days of my life to feeling like shit and lying to everyone I know. I went three days off Oxy and then a quick sub detox for four days and have to say for the first time in as long as I can remember I feel awesome. It's been two weeks since my last Oxy and just tad less for the subs. Physical withdrawals are long gone and while the cravings are still there, they're no longer accompanied by the overwhelming anxiety that usually breaks me down. Things are looking up and I'm feeling great.

I just wanted to give a big thank you to the members of this sub. No one in my life knew of my addiction, or at least ever confronted me about it, and it was always nice to have a place to feel at home. Being a lonely addict is a tough route for sure, and the support and community I've found here has been invaluable. Even it was just lurking to feel a connection to others in the same position. Sorry for the long post but to anyone else out there struggling, you can be successful with the right mindset and determination. Everything does get better, and you can get past your addiction.

This works quite well and I haven't felt the need to smoke it any other way. Now in comes crack..,"Even though it's the same idea it seems to be a completely different ball park. Now I never really cared for crack. I've done cocaine a handful of times, back when I was young and wanted to know what it was like, and later on when I'd be presented with the opportunity of doing pure or as-good-as cocaine. 

The latter was certainly remarkable and I instantly understood what all the fuss was about. But it still just wasn't my cup of tea. 

Heroin on the other hand, is not just my cup of tea. 

It's like a dogs favorite toy. He loves his owners with his typical mindless devotion but somehow that toy gets a hold of him. Somehow it's enough to make him growl at the hands that feed. 

That's heroin for me. It makes me talk like this, ugh. So anyway.... I accidently pressed save mid post. (5:06am PDT) I still need to finish this. 


I've got some nice connects here and there but sometimes when I'm in SF I like to cold cop just for the hell of it. 

There's a hondurasian (? lol no) guy or bunch of guys that sell dimebags of BTH and crack. The dope is nothing great but it's reliable, the dimebag will get you high and that's a lot to ask for when cold copping in the tenderloin. 

We've exchanged some accumulated smiles on account of tenderloins many unsavory characters as they've walked in, through and out of the scene of our many unceremonious drug deals. 

Somehow that's enough to create a sense of friendship even though we never talk. I say this because he routinely gives me more than I pay for. I think it's a combination of the fact that he doesn't use himself and I may be one of the least hairy customers in that I'm neither on the crusty nor preppy douche side. 

Though most likely he just knows how to make his customers feel special with his slick black combed hair

So today instead of a couple extra dime bags he throws me a bunch of white. I didn't really care. I actually had a juice high grade gram melting in my back pocket, I just felt like going through the motions of the tenderloin. I've come to enjoy it in a way. 

I'm really high right now. Really really high. As a matter of fact, that's the only reason I wrote this entire story while all I really wanted to do was ask some questions about smoking crack. 

So while smoking heroin is very straightforward, for some reason crack isn't? I suppose you could just chase it alongside the heroin but for some reason that isn't done. Why? 

How come even those people that share needles will go through the trouble of procuring a glass little tube (pipe??) to smoke crack. 

There's definitely something I don't understand about this substance. And given my general distaste for stimulants I haven't had the greatest desire to discover this for myself. 

Except for today but again, that is because I am very high. I somehow had enough to where I feel insulated from whatever evils this white substance may wreak upon me.              

I made sure to save some in case I learn something from this thread. 

I've skimmed over instructions of making makeshift pipe involving cigarette ashes and hole poked in aluminum foil. Why the ashes? That just seems bizarre. 

So why is crack weird? 

Why do you like smoking it? Did try crack before you tried heroin or were you like me, too high to decline? 

Somehow we all know that speedballing is dangerous but why? And how much of that danger is present when smoking crack on top of IV heroin? 

I chased it on foil today after shooting up. It hit me suddenly as I stumbled out of theindianrestaurantwhere I used the bathroom. My lips were numb my heart pounding, I felt it pound through the thick blanket. It put me in a very different frame of mind. 

I had been worried about running out of dope, whether I should buckle up and ride it out with some Kratom or get another gram and then buckle up and ride it out with kratom.. It ends the same way but at least with another gram I get to dream a little longer about what it would be a like to never ever run out of dope. 

A minute after smoking crack I was having multiple intense conversations with close friends insaneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee but useful. I called some of them after and we worked some things out. Life felt lighter and for a moment I saw myself as I was deep inside, totally free.

I'm on vacation with my parents and my GF. Both her and I are dependant, and long story short we ended up dipping into our stash a bit too often, and now I've got .2 of tar to last me until Sunday night. I've always stayed away from the needle because of the risks involved, ""you can never go back"" talk etc but seeing as being sick around my family for 4 days is not an option, I have no idea where to get dope in Santa Fe NM, and loperamide does fuck all for me, it seems like the only option I have rn. I've been planning on getting off and the only reason I didn't get on subs before I left for the trip was because I couldnt see the doctor in time. I've currently got an appointment lined up for the day after I get back.

So today I bought a box of 29g 1cc rigs at Walmart. I went to the shower of the KOA were staying at (we're traveling by RV) and got ready to do the deed, but chickened out. But after I smoked the point I had and realizing how little I have left I've made up my mind, and I'm planning on doing it tomorrow morning.

So anyway. On to the point. 

* How much should I start with to be safe? I'm not looking for an amazing rush or anything like that, I just want to stay well until I get home. 

* How big of a problem are abscesses and how do I prevent them? Honestly the idea of an infection scares the shit out of me and I'd like to do anything I can to prevent one. This is the scariest thing imo. Also any tips on preventing bruising/track marks etc.

* are the blue things in my arm arteries or veins? Do I shoot into those? I know this is a super beginner question but I honestly have no idea 

* could anyone point me to a safe IV use guide? I read a bit of the one in the sidebar but it's massive and kind of left me more confused than I started. Does anyone know if there's any video tutorials out there or at least a guide that's a little more visual?

* any general guides to IV usage or tips are appreciated as well. I need all the help I can get and I'm pretty damn nervous tbh

Thanks in advance everybody for your help, I appreciate it

Rarely even snort, just use homemade Fent HCl blotters sublingually. I'm certainly physically addicted at this point, but I can survive a day feeling ""normal"" with just a few milligrams sublingually-- and the BA using this method is not exactly high, so a lot of it is probably just wasted.

Even so, pills do nothing for me. I took 135mg of hydro a few days back, felt essentially nothing other than some stomach pains from the ~4g of APAP.  90mgs of roxi (60 intranasally, 30 orally) just made me feel a little hyper. I even tried pandas for the first time a few weeks back, I was so excited. I crushed up 2 K73s early in the morning (40mg) after ~12 hours without fent. Minor euphoria for maybe 30 minutes, then, nothing.

I miss the days when 60mgs of oxycodone made me feel like God, like I could accomplish anything--euphoric bliss.

I started using fentanyl because it was cheaper than pills. The blotters made me feel great at first. They still do to some extent. But my tolerance for seemingly every other pill (I don't do H) is completely fucked beyond belief and I doubt my brain will ever be the same again.

I do not think it is 8x stronger snorted for sure then oxycodone.. The only conversion charts I could find only had the option of ORAL or I.V.

Mine would definitely have to be the fucking hiccups. I have always despised hiccups more than anything. I have often been able to get rid of the non drug-induced hiccups by breathing in as deep as possible and pushing out as if im trying to exhale, pushing my diaphragm up into my lungs as to squeeze them as hard as I can. When I do a little too much dope, I'll get the dreaded opi-iccups. If I'm lucky, my diaphragm lung squeeze will work out (which thankfully it just did as I write this. I did a couple lines and the curse of opi-iccups hit me yet again. they've been coming and going all night cause I'm trying to kill this bag before tomorrow afternoon. I got a drug test in 4 days). The secret to the old idea of holding your breath isn't holding it, it's squeezing your lungs as much as possible. I don't exactly know why this works, but I assume it's because it helps rub out the spasm causing the hiccups which leads me to believe that hiccups are actually a muscular thing and not a neurological thing. 

Speaking of rubbing things out, not being able to get off without beating my cock red sucks ass. Sometimes I'll be able to get off in under 10 minutes but that's usually if I'm not very high or I'm also on a stimulant or something. Also, probably tied for second but probably should be ahead since it' can get to the point of being a health issue, CONSTIPATION! It sucks not being able to enjoy a nice 15-20 minutes of satisfaction on the throne of water and feces.

I have been lurking this sub for quite a while now. I have read so many interesting stories here, much more so than other subs. Such a warming community.

Anyway, I recently immigrated to the UK from Australia. Australia is a place where Opiate use has declined rapidly over the last few years, being replaced with none other than Crystal Methamphetamine. Sad, as Opiates are my favourite. I really couldn't find anyone that sold it, and I never explored in the dnm's enough to get my hands on it.

To the question at hand, how common is Opiate use in the UK, Heroin or Perscription? Would it be incredibly difficult to find? Is Codeine abuse as prevalent in the UK as it is in Australia? 

And lastly, prices (not sure if we're allowed to discuss that. Not necessary but rough estimates would be appreciated greatly).

PS: Not asking for sources, just an estimate of the prevalence of Opiate/oids in the UK.

Thanks in advance to all who took the time to read and reply. I really appreciate it!

Peace.",1469167369.0

So the last few nights, as I've been falling asleep, I've been formulating this idea of a mega collection of prescription narcotics. I wanna assemble one and I kept running through this list in my head but getting lost halfway through. So tonight, I sat down and wrote out a list of 20 prescription painkillers (no fent analogues ) that will be my life's work to assemble and consume.

Tell me what you think of my dream and my list. What would you include (I wanted to keep it at 20) or subtract. Which is your favorite. Are any of them stupid / impossible to find or consume without dying (etorphine and co is a stretch here)?

Without further ado. The list . . .

Tramadol,
Codiene,
Dihydrocodiene,
Hydrocodone,
Oxycodone,
Morphine,
Ethyl morphine,
Hydromorphone,
Oxymorphone,
Diacetyl morphine,
Meperdine,
Pentazocine,
Propoxyphene,
Levorphanol,
Methadone,
Etorphine,
Buprenorphine,
Dihydroetorphine,
Thienorphine,
Fentanyl

However, I read a lot of the posts on this sub and enjoy it quite a bit. 

I just wanted to say that I have now successfully been on buprenorphine for a little over a month and am really happy about it. I had tried to get on it many times, but always either took the bupe too soon, or couldn't stand the withdrawals for long enough and just go back to shooting up. (Or just stayed on it for a bit and relapsed because I wasn't ready to be clean.) The difference for me this time was that I was sick of being a junkie and using just to stay well. I can't even remember the last time that I was actually high.

This time what I did was leave town and bring xanax, gaba and tianeptine (I think that's what it's called) and used all of those in high doses for two days. At the end of the second day I started with the bupe and stayed away from the city I live in for a few weeks to keep myself from relapsing. (I should add that I barely remember those two days. I was very out of it and from what the people helping me said, I was screaming because of the pain, but I am very happy I don't remember the experience.) Once I returned to my city, I decided that I wanted to stay my version of clean and save money. I have a job that I love, but really live paycheck to paycheck anyway. I realized that I could start to try and save if I wasn't spending all my money on dope. I should also mention that in my country dope is extremely cheap. The bupe has really given me a chance to live a normal life and although I still get some pretty bad cravings, I try and concentrate on other things. 

This is not the first time I've tried to get clean using bupe or other methods, but it is the first time that I feel good about my choice. I just wanted to share my experience here for anyone that it may interest or maybe for people thinking about getting on subs. I hope everyone is doing well!",1469163297.0
4u15u2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4u15u2/i_am_an_idiot/,22,https://redd.it/4u15u2,OrangePepper5,I Am an Idiot,"Hello everybody!

First visit to Reddit was maybe a year or two ago. Started visiting the site more and more until starting coming daily about six months or so. But this is my very first post, and couldn't think of a better place to do so than here! 

I've been using H daily for about eight months now, give or take. I've lived in my area practically my entire 24 years on this earth, except for the five years (victory lap ya heard) it took me to graduate from college, and sadly I only know one dealer. This guy is great, product is ALWAYS top of the line, lives only about 10-15 minutes away depending on traffic, and doesn't BS you. I've been spoiled, and it WAS great. Past tense. 

Apparently he got busted late last night/early this morning. Now I'm fucked. Luckily, I've always kept a emergency 20 bag hidden away somewhere in my room for times like these. Of course I've dipped my hand in that cookie jar when I didn't necessarily need to, but I'm fucking junkie, and am constantly living in the now. Last time I did that was maybe two weeks ago, but I had since replaced the bag. To my surprise, when going to grab it, I actually had put two 20s in there, didn't really remember doing it either.  But who cares, I was straight. Now I know I won't be getting any boy any time soon, so I forced myself to wait to do it until I started noticing signs of WD, which for me, is sneezing twice in a row. When I'm high, I NEVER sneeze, but once the half life wears out I'm a damn sneezing fool. 

Sure enough, my first two sneezes come around 4/4:30 this afternoon, thank god I'm getting off of work at 5. Get home, bee line for my stash. I say fuck it, I'll do both at once. Go through the motions, draw it up, everything is going smooth until I shake it to get it all down. The fucking plunger drops out. It was like slow fucking motion as I watch my dark yellow liquid gold fall to the ground. I guess in my reckless and hastily prep, I had pulled the plunger too far, past the 100 CC mark. Has never happened to me before. I immediately drop to my knees with cotton in hand, my floors are hardwood, but here's the kicker. The shot drops about 10 CC on the wood, the rest, and the majority( about 50 CC, I prefer about 50-60 CC Of water per shot), dropped onto my fucking semi-shaggy rug. Yay!!! I soak up and pull up as much of the shit I can off the wood, and then, without hesitation, I start licking the shit out of my carpet. If there was a vag there instead, I would of broken the record for fastest orgasm by tongue. I was like a god damn machine for those five seconds. Humiliating? Yes, but it's not even close to the worst thing I've done dope related. Once I'm done with everything, it finally sets in. I'm not high, I have no way to get high, and I feel like killing myself; figuratively of course. 

Sorry for the novel, but I'm not going to sleep anytime soon, it's currently ten minutes till 1 AM here as I'm typing this, my WDs are starting to intensify, and I wanted to leave an impression with my first post. Thanks for reading everyone. 

TL; DR I am an idiot who wasted $40 worth of dope and my dealer got arrested so I'm extremely miserable at the moment. ",1469163275.0

It contains APAP, caffeine and butalbital--a barbiturate.  A good Fioricet high is on par with OxyContin for me.  (The new OP ones that are time-release anyway).  The catch is that I have to have not used it in a week or more, as the buzz diminishes quickly with repeated use.  If I have some dihydrocodeine or codeine on hand, I'll pop 1-2 of those with the Fioricet and be feeling goooooooood.  I can't use it as often as I do opiates though, as the rebound anxiety/headaches/depression are godawful.  

I also use Benzedrex or another stimulant in low doses daily, along with Prozac & an opiate (usually dihydrocodeine).  My DOC--oxycodone--only comes around ever so often, so I have to make due with what I have.  When my DHC runs out, I usually resort to tianeptine sulfate or kratom.

I feel like such a fuck up and a shithead.

So, if someone could guide me-- even if it's to other threads or just just spell out a few things for me, you'd be my hero.  Here's the general gist.  I'm getting quite a few opana/oxym's.  I've been taking them intranasally for awhile but to a point it seems like its effect continues to wane and I at least once just want to understand/try IVing (I have no experience with it on my own to be blunt).  I have shitty/deep veins, so chances are I'll do it once then never again just because I know it would take way to much effort-- but, I just would like the experience. I only know this because at doctor's nurses have always had problem or end up having to draw blood from me on veins on my hands.  So, I guess I just want to know if I was going to go out and buy gear, what would one recommend to attempt IVing opana?  Is there a place in person I can buy rigs?  Is cotton all I need to filter it/is there a really nicely written guide that already answers all this?

I apologize for my noobishness and I know some will warn against me even wanting to do this, but I'm among the many that have set their mind to it, even if it's not the best path.  I appreciate any help and guidance. <3

I smoke weed every day and have tried plenty of drugs but never became addicted to them. I was in a 1.5 year relationship with a woman I legitimately felt I was going to marry and spent all my time with her. She left me after her mom tragically passed away from a heart attack and it was too much for her to handle even though I tried to stick by her side.


I can't really put it into words, but she was my everything. Many of my friends have moved away in the past year and I don't party much anymore, I used to be able to do everything with her. I knew her family well; she knew mine. I'm sure I can find someone else, but never someone I can relate to so perfectly.


And now the only way I can deal with it is fentanyl. I have hundreds of doses suspended in saline and leftover powder as well. I've been doing it every night for the past week, and while it's not that ""fun"" of a drug, it certainly helps numb the pain. I fear I could get addicted to it but just can't bring myself to flush it, as I'd have nothing to go to when the heartbreak hits (I don't drink too much.)


I was just wondering if anyone can relate or if anyone has advice which could help me out. Thanks for any input.",1469126005.0

Hello Redditors!
Currently, I am working at Project Weber, an incredible organization which is devoted to harm reduction, and improving the lives of those who need a helping hand. Below I posted a short history of what Project Weber/Renew are all about. Essentially, we are a non-profit harm reduction agency for male, female, and trans sex workers.
History Project Weber was founded in 2008 as a harm-reduction organization for street-based male sex workers (MSW) in Rhode Island. The organization provides many services, confidentially and free of charge, including: rapid HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing, condoms and safer sex materials, syringe exchange and injection kit disposal, overdose reversal medications (Narcan/Naloxone), in-house and street-based peer-led support and outreach, risk-reduction counseling, and supported referrals. PW services are delivered primarily by peer workers – former sex workers who are keenly aware of the distinct psychosocial needs of MSW. Through this peer-driven model, PW has established trusting relationships with a large group of MSW in the greater Providence area. These experiences give the organization unique access to the target population and facilitate their utilization of the services provided.
Project RENEW was founded in 2006 with the goal to work collaboratively to provide services for women engaged in, or at risk for, commercial sex work or human trafficking in Rhode Island, with a focus on Providence, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. The primary focus of the organization is peer-led street outreach, intensive case management, HIV and HCV prevention and testing, basic needs services, and referrals. The clients are referred to partner agencies that provide services as diverse as detox, substance abuse treatment, mental and physical healthcare, housing, legal aid, and job training and employment. Project RENEW also works to advocate for increased resources for at-risk women, and serves as an information “portal” for those researching commercial sex work.
In 2016, Project Weber and Project RENEW merged in order to combine their efforts to serve a range of high-risk men and women, including transgender persons. Prior to merging, the two programs mirrored each other in many of their respective programs including HIV prevention and testing services as well as basic needs and referrals delivered through a peer street outreach model. This merger will position the new organization as one of the few agencies in the nation dedicated to serving a diverse population of sex workers. It is our hope that the merging of these two projects at the forefront of harm reduction work will facilitate information sharing among staff and peer workers to promote best practices across sex worker populations. We further anticipate that this merger will enable the new organization to secure additional funding focused on this broader, more inclusive population, including the transgender population, which had previously been underserved in Rhode Island.
Drug Safety Drug safety is an incredibly important issue to Weber/Renew. Often times, users may not know all the precautionary steps that they can take in order to better their experience, and reduce risk. Firstly, IV usage must be addressed. Using clean needles, and using NEW needles is imperative in reducing harm. While needles may look sharp after a few uses, they actually can become blunt after as little as one use, depending on the gauge of the needle. As the needle becomes more blunt, the odds of it tearing through tissue, and leaving pathways for pathogens to enter your body increase, which puts the user at great risk. Although cleanliness of needles is often touched upon, reusing needles is an issue which definitely deserves some more coverage. An excellent resource for IV usage can be found here.
Another piece of information that is commonly overlooked is the fact that crack pipes, which are often not the best quality glass, can transmit diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This doesn’t occur simply because of the transfer of saliva, but instead it occurs because as the glass pipe is heated, it can cause sores and lesions in the user’s mouth, which can then be a pathway for transmitting disease. An extremely simple solution to this is to use an adaptor which doesn’t get extremely warm on the stem of the pipe. This can be something as simple as some vinyl tubing, or it can be a dedicated mouthpiece that you have purchased.
As far as other, more well-known pieces of advice go, it is essential that if you are an opiate user, you also have some Narcan/Nalaxone on hand. This stuff can truly work wonders, and now it is being offered over the counter in many states, it may be expensive in some states, but your life is worth more! Another thing that is touched upon to frequently is the testing of heroin. Other drugs have the luxury of receiving publicity about the various reagents that are used to identify them, however, heroin is often overlooked in this regard. A testing reagent can be found here. The reagent is used to detect acetyl-fentanyl in your heroin. Again, it does cost money but your life is worth more.

And then I started thinking further, what if people here are already shilling?  Cuz I never see posts about just generic sour gummy worms, its always Sour Patch Kids.

So like are y'all already doing this and just keeping it on the DL?  Y'all need to help your boy out and link him to where he needs to sign up if so.

So, I'm just looking for a bit more help and guidance on one of the most serious choices that I know can make things worse more than better. History wise, you'll be able to see what I take.  I've been on many things over the years, but I'm actually incredibly new to the scene with opiates and mastering the best ways to maximize your benefits out of them.

After 10 years, oxymorphone has proven to be the best for me  in that it at least helps more than the others-- but orally, it doesn't do much.  So, after reading alot via posts here, I learned about the benefits of sniffing them. However, after time it seems like I'm losing the effectiveness without taking several more which seems pretty risky itself. So, after weighing the options and the risk, I've decided I want to give IVing a try.

I know many will say don't, hell a small part of me knows as confident as I pretend to be about self control-- it won't make things better long run.  But, all the same I want to try.  However, I want to look to the people here who have been around way longer than me-- who have much more details and techniques.  So, please, whether you can help me with the steps of IVing or recommendations on the best way to take Opana, I can't thank you enough and welcome any help.

Considering I've been left this month with the 54 over 814 oxy's, I'm even  more at a loss how you'd go about using this to IV since they're harder to crush and also gel a bit in my nose compared to non-white generics I've had.  All I know so far is that I would need 29g  long tip rigs if I do go through with IVing, as my veins are deep and difficult to find on my arm (help with how to even find them is more than appreciated).  But, from there I don't know the best/safest way to begin the process nor what I need.  The other problem is where I live does not have a Needle Exchange, so obtaining the materials easily through them isn't an option unfortunately.  I've heard about cotton and micron filters?  How does that effect what rig I need?  Does anyone know the best way/ can tell me what to do if I were to do it?  Even if it's some referrals to other posts, I can't thank you enough.  Thank you for ant and all help and suggestions that any of you can provide.

Also, I feel like it's possible that I might not even need to go to this  means and felt like I should reach out and see if anyone has recommendations that would make insufflation as maximized as possible or if there's another ROA that's better? I'm willing to bet there's some techniques/recommendations I have no clue about.  

I apologize for being so clueless and I know it makes me pretty average/noobish, but I only hope to become more informed and hopefully, if I defy the odds, use what help I get to get the most out of my use and be more responsible and able to assist others.

Thank you again. c:

This is my account of how I went from occasional tramadol use to a full blown, crying screaming u4 addict. I had my last dose of u4 3 days ago now.

My partner has a medical condition that isn't too serious, but he thought it might be fun to try some narcotics so he milked his condition as much as he could and got prescribed tramadol, zomorph and oramorph. I really had nothing to do with this and had never had any interest in trying any of them for 3 years. He kept his use casual. To be honest I was a bit of a prude when it came to drug use, but he would use them with alcohol and had a great time getting incoherently drunk. The once or twice I tried them I just found they either didn't have an effect or made me sick, and hangovers were bad enough when we would drink to excess every weekend. 

The drug use started when I got promoted in September 2015 from a regular shop assistant at work to leading the same team I came from (over 100 people) as a line manager with absolutely no management experience, as a girl that has always been incredibly shy. I couldn't cope with the stress and started drinking more. I just wanted to forget all the stress from work when I got home but I had to answer texts from my boss even on my days off. My working week went from 30 hours to 50 hours and to top this all off they only paid me minimum wage and only for 35 hours of my time - no overtime.

This was when I started taking tramadol recreationally. At first it would only be 2 50mg pills on a weekend (I had two weekends a week as I had Saturday and Wednesday off). Then I started taking it instead of alcohol as I felt  alcohol ruined the effect. Eventually I would start the weekend off at work by popping two trams at work at lunch time, then using 4 at a time, etc. At work I felt absolutely off my face and it made working Saturdays bearable.

Within about 2 months of starting with tramadol I was taking it most days. I was going through an awful time at work - especially after a gruelling christmas with 12 hour days and no days off. I began crying most days and I was generally an absolute mess. I wanted to quit - but everyone was so proud of me and told me how great of a job I was doing. My partner saw it was getting to me and one trammed up night I wrote my letter of resignation.

I should mention my partner began using research chemicals including u47700 around january but it was casual. Being the prude that I was I hated seeing him sniffing lines. My sister is also a big cocaine user and when she would come round they would both do lines without me - not that I berated them for it I just saw it as kind of forbidden. Eventually I tried u4 and cocaine and fell in love. When my sister wasn't round we would combine u4 with 3fpm to make a kind of speedball. I felt so good on it, and my sex drive went through the roof. I felt so in love and loved, and for the first time in a long time, I was happy. Alcohol wasn't even a part of our lives anymore.

I started job hunting straight away and got offered the first job interviewed for, starting in Feb. The hours were a lot better and I was just one of the many colleagues there so things were a lot more bearable. 

May Bank holiday was the turning point for our drug use. My partner had ordered a batch of u4 online but it turned out to be 4ho met - a really fun psychedelic (nice one Best Feel). We had the best four days of our lives laughing, taking u4, 3fpm, 4ho met and fucking and I know when I'm 80 years old I will look back at those days and remember them as the best days of my life. 

By now we were using so much u4 that a dependency was starting to develop. In the morning we would do a line to stave off the withdrawal - and once you've started the day off with a line of u4 it becomes difficult not to give in to cravings to do more. I got used to doing lines in the morning and would always do them before work. I never took u4 to work though. I would feel terribly ill at work withdrawing because of the incredibly short half life. 

My partner was just as bad and actually took u4 to work on occasion. Because I was so tired from nodding away all the time I would fall asleep at my desk. I tried to take 3fpm to wake myself up, but while I was withdrawing 3fpm would make me instantly puke.

Performance wise at work I only began to suffer during June. My partner saw a change in me and I was seriously addicted - he hid the stash. I would do anything to make him give me a line. Behind his back I would go round the house scraping dvd cases, cutting open straws to scrape out the insides, getting whatever I could off any notes lying around.

Luckily we had my partner's prescriptions to stave off some of the withdrawals. By this point my nose was getting seriously fucked up - hard inside, bloody, always blocked. My partner's nose and throat were worse. I thought my depression was emerging again but now I realise I was always depressed but I was hiding it with the drugs. I couldn't hide my problems any longer at work and my partner convinced me to go to a drug clinic.

They were useless, they didn't even know what u4 was, I had to wait 4 weeks to get any meds but I only had a two week sick note from my doctor. We gave up and decided to go it alone with varying levels of success. We always went back to using though. There was one time that my partner forgot where he hid a 50g bag of u4 - which I found a day after what we swore would be our last line. I ended up not going back to work and my partner is supporting me. 

About a week ago we decided to do a big dose of 4 ho met and the psychedellic made me see how stupid I was being - addicted to a little white powder, crying my eyes out over it, ruining my life over it. I asked my partner to flush our massive bag of u4 down the toilet and he did it, but kept a few grams back so we had time to taper.

The worst part of this week was realising I had finally scraped every little drop of powder from around the house. All our u4 was gone. I had a horrible feeling in my gut and felt like an idiot for asking my partner to flush it all. I wondered if I would ever be truly happy without opiates.

We got away with not withdrawing too badly thanks to kratom and the prescriptions. The tiredness is difficult to deal with. That and the fact that I have made my partner so depressed and upset by being the way I was. I'm just trying to remember we need the chemical balance in our brains to return to normal and we can be as happy as we were before all this started. At the moment he is coping worse than me with his mental state and I feel so guilty. I know he feels guilty and feels like it's his fault we went through this but I have an addictive personality. It was bound to happen.

If you made it this far thank you so much for reading. I am already seeing signs of my old self returning, my motivation growing. I'm in no way proud of myself and if I was alone I would have probably ended up addicted for the rest of my life.",1469276473.0

""One dark"" hangs up.   
20 minutes later someone.who I assume is him walks round the corner. We've never spoken beyond the phone so I have no idea.

I'm already long gone, probably in a public bathroom by now.

But today.. the whole routine was disrupted. I'd gotten to the walk to the place.. but on the way, I actually ran into the runner -  I guess he was returning from another serve. He didn't smile, he never has, but he started a conversation that I couldn't decipher a single word of. I always thought it was the phone making his voice muffled, but he actually sounds like that - combined with rudeboi speak - he might as well have been martian.
""Yo  man dems on rise. Road ting be up, one D aye?"" He looked at me expectantly waiting for a reply.   
""Uhh.. yeah, one dark I wanted"" 
""Riley stick down "" he pointed at a road to wait at. Turned round, disappeared for a minute and came back with the goods. ""Thanks"" I said, wondering if that word had entered the vocabulary on his planet yet.

Can you beleive it? I quit heroin. Buprenorphine saved my life.
More than 30 days without heroin.

I managed to do that, thanks to the (xtremely surprisingly) organised greek ""State Maintenance Treatment"".

As Europeans, you can guess that it's prohibited for any private doctor to prescribe Subutex/Suboxone, so the State has created this system, which is free of charge for everyone. 

I waited on the list for 7 years, but thankfully the new leftist goverment managed to erase the corruption in OKANA (that's how the system's called), and the waiting time dropped to 3 months (from 6-8 years).

The system doesn't only prescribe Subs, but you have your own personal therapist. 

It works as follows:

They call you, and inform you that in 1 week you have to go for orientation. In your 1st orientation, my temporary therapist informed me about Buprenorphine (everything: pharmacology, how-to, etc), and how the state maintenance system works. She told me that in 1 week I'll get my 1st dose of Buprenorphine, so I have to drop my dosage of H day-by-day, and come on Monday in full withdrawals. 

She recommended 16-18 hours. I abstainced 48 (!!!). I did that because I was FUCKING TERRIFIED of the case of Precipated Withdrawals.


And I did  it. 48 hours with no heroin.


My first day was dreamy. I was so dopesick, and before my 1st dose, I had to talk to a state doctor, in order for him to ensure that I am in full withdrawals, and figure out the dosage depending on my past use. He started me in 8mgs. It was heaven. Not only the hellish withdrawals were gone, but the Bupe actually gave (and it still gives me), a better, cleaner high than H.


I got ""stabilized"" for 2 weeks in the central building in the centre of Athens. My stabilized dosage was 12mg per day.

After 2 weeks of evaluation (your personality, whether you've relapsed, the geographical position of your house), they send you in a hospital close to your house. Cases of people who do parallel use of bupe and H (I cant fathom why they do this), are sent in far away hospitals, which are Low Tolerance Maintenance Units (aka hitler doctors and urine checking almost daily).

I was an A+ student. My file had an ""excellent"" remark, because I never touched H again, and because I have no aggressive personality.

So... They sent me just 4 blocks away from my house, in the BEST Maintenance Unit in Athens.

Long story short, they let me chose whether I'd like to come daily to take 12mgs, or every other day for 24mgs. I chose daily, because Bupe works best that way for me. 

In Fridays, they give us our ""Take-Home"", in an envelope with a presription inside.

If you are a good boy and have a good ""grade"" (kinda like college), they will give you the choice some day, to come once A MONTH, and take a month's worth of Subs.

In order to see who and if sells their take-home subs, every unit (especially mine, which is located next to the open air market), they have secret agents to see if any of their patients is ""Around"" for suspicious reasons. A mole, if you will.

Also, my therapist prescribed me Mirtazapine and Lyrica, which make a killer combo with my daily Bupe!! 

I am a whole new person, man. Already +10 kilos, more beautiful, healthy looking. I bathe every day, and I do not look any junky-ish at all anymore. 

Ask me anything about my Subutex experiences (because as of today, I have a 100% sucess rate), or the greek state system. 

*You can also message me ANYTIME you want, if you are in Sub treatment and want some support! If I can do it, trust me, anyone can!*

**With Subutex, I want to throw up whenever I see someone snorting heroine, and I've even developed an aversion to it, can you beleive it! This substance is a miracle drug if you want to really quit heroine.**

**And above all -everyone-. I'm now out of this sooo tiring game of ""where to find money -> go to the romas -> dangerous environments -> illegal situations -> snort H -> repeat"".** 

**It's worth it. Sooo worth it.**

Switched to morphine, currently taking 3-400mg MS daily.
It doesn't give me any high feeling, keeps my back feeling ok.

But I need to quit regardless of back pain, it's not affordable to continue buying at this level, and there are other concerns that go along with it.

I am really happy with life, and not taking it to avoid anything or as a coping mechanism, strictly for pain and to keep WD's at bay at this point.

I ordered everything I was ever curious about on DNMs to try. The latest order was a gram of heroin. Having 0 tolerance I snorted the tiniest little bumps and that had me feeling pretty good for a long time. I did that daily and now the gram is almost gone. I'm thinking about ordering again even though it wasn't my initial intention. It was such a nice after work high and I think its a good replacement for a pint of beer. 

My friends know about my experimentation. Some of them even do the same. They think I have a problem because I'm thinking of buying another gram.

But we are not normal. 

I used to have things. Nice things. A nice apartment,  a new car,  the newest toys,  treating my mom to an expensive vacation every summer. Now I'm sleeping on the floor on her apartment a few days a week  and sleeping in my car the other half. 

How I got here doesn't matter,  because lightning doesn't strike twice. 

There is no repairing things I've broken. 

I got lucky with my career the first time around. That won't happen again. 

I have no brighter future, because I'm living my future. This is where my life was supposed to go,  how I was supposed to end up. 

At least at this point,  I have nothing to worry about anymore. Things literally can't get any worse. 

My mom came into the room and starting sobbing,  saying  she can't support me,  and that I have to figure something out. And that she's been so depressed lately because she feels so guilty. 

So,  in the morning,  before she wakes up,  I'm leaving. I don't know where I'm going but at this point I'm done. I give up. Heroin wins. I can't keep trying anymore. There is no point in getting a minimum wage job because using what little energy I have to work my ass off,  for  a small percentage of what I used to make, is more upsetting to me than sleeping in my car. 

It bears repeating,  if you're thinking of trying opiates,  or graduating to heroin,  DONT.  Unless you want this post to be you in a few years. My life is over. I'll never,  ever get it back. There's nothing I can do to ever be happy again. I wouldn't want this for my worst enemy. 

My family cries for me,  my friends are to stressed to even worry about me anymore. 

I quite literally have nothing left. 

Let my life be a lesson for those who chip,  or are thinking about starting.

Help?,"So recently I quit a gram a day habit cold turkey (not by choice, dealer went MIA, everyone else was out of stuff) and suffered through about a week of terrible withdrawal. I'll try to describe it best I can... Long post so here's the **TL;DR: Quit a gram a day H habit, had a severe mental break that totally removed me from reality. Don't know if it was schizophrenia, dehydration, or if that what's happens to some people when you quit H. Figured I'd ask all you knowledgeable folks here.**

Day 1: The urge to use starts. RLS is affecting me, and I'm sick.

Day 2: All these symptoms plus throwing up.

Day 3: I start slurring my words. My roommates noticed it first, and after they mentioned it, I noticed too. I began to notice that I was sluggish, it was hard for me to concentrate, and whenever I stood up, I'd almost black out.

Day 4. Full blown schizophrenic episode. Seeing people that weren't there, talking to them. I was interacting with a dream world, while living in the real world. I was having *full blown* conversations, complete with hand motions, with figments of my imagination. My roommates would ask ""who are you talking to?"" And it would snap be back to reality for a second, I'd look around and go ""Oh... I guess no one."" But then the dream world would come back.

Day 5: Roommates called paramedics. They found in my room, naked, talking to my friend ""Carlos"" who was in the corner of my room. I was also as white as a sheet, since I guess I hadn't drank any water since day 2. Went to the hospital, and I guess I kept pulling my IV out, so they got pissed at me, diagnosed me with ""Opiate withdrawl"" and ""Dehydration"" and sent me packing within 4 hours. They put me in a cab, and apparently I kept talking to two people who weren't there. When I got home, my roommates put to bed, where I passed out.

Day 6: Kept seeing cats that weren't there, and spiders  (luckily I knew the spiders weren't real, I think at this point I started to come back to reality) along with crazing vivid dreams. I would dream something, thought it occurred in real life, and then act on it. Example: I thought I bought a lighter in my dream, and so I spent 2-3 hours looking for it.

Day 7: I come back to reality, somewhat. I keep seeing cats in my closet, and spiders made out of hair, but I know they're not real. I just try to sleep and have fun with my dreams since they were so vivid. I was beginning to be able to control them a bit, which was admittedly fun.

Day 8: Almost fully recovered. Memory from days 3-7 are almost non-existent. What I've told you is literally all I remember, with a few blanks filled in by my roommates.

I'm completely better now, not even a hint of whatever the fuck that was. And the best part is I'm clean for the first time in a long time :D

I've been reading and watching a lot about suboxone tapers and how it feels to get off of subs, and I really want to experience complete sobriety. Even though I feel ""normal"" now, it's not the same as complete sobriety ""normal"". Someone explained getting off suboxone like this, ""It was like someone turning a black and white TV into a 4k TV with the volume all the way up. Colors got bright, sound was loud! It's like becoming a new person."" 
One common thing I keep reading is, even though you feel normal on suboxone, you don't realize you're still ""numb"". You get feelings and emotions back, and they come back hard... The bad ones and the good ones.


  I've been clean from EVERYTHING (except subs) for the past two and a half months, and I really want to keep it that way and keep tapering down. So, the past two weeks I've been taking 4mg of sub with really no discomfort at all. On Monday I plan on starting 2mg and see how I feel. I want to be off of the subs by October.

I want anecdotal reports of how you managed to get off of subs and how you felt. SO if you got off subs successfully, please chime in and tell me how you did it, how you felt while on vs off, and anything else related!

I told my dealer ""I see you made a friend"" and he responded with, ""oh, it's dey kitty."" Like it's ""their"" kitty. After we leave I say it a couple times and laugh because it's just funny to me.

Anyway, I get up to the house and ask and he tells me that ""Dey bathroom is messed up"". I get back out to the car and tell my SO and I can tell he's just mulling it over in his brain. He looks super confused. I make fun of my dealer some more and then he asked me what a ""Day Kitty"" was and also what a ""day bathroom"" was. I cracked up and asked, ""what, a day kitty versus a night kitty??"" and he got pissed.

Through the years, I've watched a bit of those true crime shows (Dateline, Forensic Files, etc.), as well as the fictional / semi-fictional stuff (L&O, SVU, etc.). I've seen multiple stories, in which an otherwise ""undetectable"" substance (or just plain air. HA!) was injected into a person to murder them. However small the needle mark was, the medical examiner would usually find it.

Building off the needle mark, I've been an IV drug user for a long, long time. In the beginning, sure, I rotated spots, but heavy use lead to some spots collapsing. For the past XX years, when I find a spot, I usually tap it for up to a month ... Sometimes, it's a few months - this results in tracks, and eventual scars. When fresh, the tracks resemble a cut or scratch more than they do actual needle marks. Some of you may see where this is going.

Now, say someone (**SWIM**, lol) were to inject another someone with some substance, in order to kill them. If they were thorough, and maybe stuck the person, multiple times, in very fine line pattern (connecting the dots, making things appear more ""cut"" like), would an ME be able to determine that to still be an injection site?

I figured I'd start here, in this sub. Maybe the appropriate people could be paged to this post. Maybe it needs to be x-posted elsewhere. Just thought I'd share one of those dark thoughts my brain decides to pummel me with while trying to fall asleep. 

If anyone cares to build upon this thought, or has an answer, go for it. If you feel like calling me a dumb cunt, that's fine, too. Discuss.

Recently I was prescribed zubsolv, klonopin and zoloft by the same doctor. He made sure all the doses were small enough to have no negative reactons between them. For the first time in 6+ years not only am I clean (thanks to zubsolv) but I am actually happy and feel good from the other two. I used to wake up and just wait for the day to end so I could go to sleep. Essentially I was sitting around waiting to die and hoping that death would come as soon as humanly possible. Since getting these prescriptions my life has seemingly changed overnight. I am happy for the first time in ages.... I am not dreading every day and I am not counting down the moments until I can go back to sleep. I actually plan things and go out and do activities and see friends during the day.

At the time I almost feel like I'm doing myself a favor. Kind of like that feeling you get from tidying your house when you're all energetic and high. Ive done it so many times that Im better at noticing myself doing it now and I  walk away from the mirror before I do too much damage. But this time, this is something else.  Ive really overdone it. My entire fucking face, shoulders, areas of my back that I could reach, my scalp, ears, fucking scabs *everywhere* . Even the junkie  people I live around are like GOD DAMN SON! When they see me. I lost my job because of how bad my face looks. It was a piece on shit job that I didnt care about but I still need the fucking cash. Fuck. An old really good friend of mine was in town that I hadn't seen in 6 years was here. I was going to try to hide my using from him because hes been *pretty* much clean for those 6 years besides a bit of coke. Of course he knew straight away. He ended up relapsing and shooting ice and heroin with me I think because he knew I was high and maybe it got him thinking about it? Cant say that for certain but I bet if i went over there clean faced and clear eyed, healthy and sober looking there would've been like a 99% chance that he *would not* have begged me to get him drugs and shoved cash into my pockets. Im a weak as fuck, shitty friend and just a wreck of a human being in general so of course I agree to get them, especially he was paying for all of it. All together it about $250 in dope and $200 on ice. We had a pretty good time until he went in to some psychosis shit where he wasn't making sense and I was scared as fuck for him. So all in all it was a bad experience for him. He didnt even do even close to his half of the drugs either. He insisted many many times that none of his relapsing was my fault but I know he was just to make me feel better. All of this because I cant stop picking at my stupid fucking face. Over the past few days my face has even gotten *worse* because all of the extra dope and ice and  I cant stop picking. It happens like this, ill scratch my head because I feel an itch. While I scratch the itch I feel a little bump on my head. Im absolutely convinced that its a blackhead or a little pimple so i maybe it doesn't pop after a gentle  squeeze, ill pinch  the fuck out of it, or i just try to *scratch it out*, yea you read that correctly. Its as if the offending bump *must go* at all costs. Its so ironic because in my mind Im getting rid of blackheads and pimples and making my face look better.  But in actuality Im slowly and *systematically destroying my fucking face*  .Im on dope so Im *always* itchy as fuck,  thus rubbing my skin and feeling *tiny* little bumps that I think are blackheads or pimples that need popping. This is constantly. I keep noticing and stopping and noticing and stopping. Anytime my hand is idle i catch myself rubbing my chin, or side of my face, or chest. I think it might be the meth. Id never really been into it that much before i came to this city. Id only ever smoked it until last week. Ive been shooting dope for a decade and this is the worst ive done to myself. Ive just last week or so started  shooting meth with my dope and I think thats what's making me like this. Id like to add that when Im not on dope/meth, I almost never pick at my face because sober, logical me knows that Im making my face so much worse. I need to get my life together. ",1469207497.0

The title pretty much sums up my dilemma. In an attempt to quit heroin and abusing pain medication I'm looking into being admitted into a local addiction clinic and then selecting which medication (Suboxone or methadone or subutex) I would take going forward. 

Obviously I'm having trouble deciding which one would suit me best. It may not be, but it feels like a really important decision. 

For those of you out there with experience with any of these I'm asking for your opinions on which you prefer and why; and if you're feeling really froggy which do you think would fit me best.

As stated earlier my DOC is heroin but I also love opanas when available. My habit has gotten to around 1 g/day which for me is completely ridiculous and out of control.  To be honest I still think I need my medication to get me high (I'm not quit ready to give up that yet, I just don't want to die).  I don't need to be nodding out everyday but I would love to feel the warm blanket of opiate love. The big picture plan I have is to start taking one of the three medications, get settled into a routine of that, and begins therapy or counseling of some kind in hopes of getting to the roots of my issues.

Generally I try to keep an open mind, but I've always been skeptical of AA and NA because a lot of it seems kind of objective as far as people's beliefs and morals go. From my experience, feeling like a strong person has helped in the path toward recovery, but in these programs, they encourage you to think the opposite of yourself. They want you to think that you're weak and are doomed without God and the program. 

As far as the whole God thing goes, they touched up in the meeting today about how God doesn't have to be a Christian God or a Jewish God, literally whatever it means to you. For you, God could be simply love, companionship, and support. Personally, I 100% lack any sense of faith. I think that no matter the situation, everything is exactly as it's supposed to be, but ultimately I believe in meaningless existence. I'm very glad that was covered, and it was honestly cool to sit and listen to the speakers. I've always thought these programs are great and help a lot of people, I was just never interested enough to do it myself.

Anyway, back to self will. So I ended up talking with the speaker and several others, and I always brought up recovery from addiction coming from you and only you. Only your strength and willpower. I've done it before with opiates, but it only lasted a year and a half. Anyway, it honestly disappointed me to hear each and every person tell me that they firmly believe a person isn't strong enough to do it and needs to be balls deep in 12 step programs. Now, don't get me wrong, addiction is a real bitch, but I think it's doable. I'm seeing a drug counselor right now, but that isn't often and I pretty much fight it on my own, and I've made a ton of progress.

So I've just brought a fentanyl/mannitol mix which should be with me in the next few days. It was only $25 for 1g and for a first time user apparently I shouldn't go above 10mg snorted first time. I'd rather this than spend $65 on 1g heroin which sounds like it won't me as long. 

I've been intrigued by opiates for a long time and this was bound to happen, last time I was this low was about 4 years back and attempted suicide. I've suffered horribly with crippling depression and anxiety which stopped me from getting an education and decent social life. I've already been addicted to RC benzos in the past but it didn't go on for very long so I only suffered mild withdrawals.

I want to snort the oxycodone instead of drinking the resultant liquid from a cold water extraction.

I'm aware that I can perform a CWE and then evaporate the liquid leaving, presumably, just oxy with *some* APAP (1g per 100ml of water I believe) but this is slow.

I assume that there is a chemical process or solvent that oxy doesn't  dissolve readily into but that APAP does. Or maybe there isn't one. The hope being that instead of keeping the liquid in the end, you would throw it out as it has all the apap, and the solids filtered out would be the oxy you would want to dry then use.

I'm hoping the organic chem nerds embrace their inner addict and can shed some light on this for me ;)

EDIT: After looking up the merck index of oxy and apap, it seems apap is soluble in acetone. Oxy doesn't say anything about acetone, though.
Could acetone be used to ""dissolve"" the apap leaving behind the oxy and other insoluble fillers?

Is there some hotline they've set up to report potentially psychoactive products?

Can we overwhelm the government by getting things banned that have actually have no effect at all! Eg.. Make loads of claims and write anecdotes online about a rush purchasing things like cheese or tinned mackerel because it can easily be converted or smoked to become a highly addictive drug. Perhaps we should bring back the old tale about banana skins being dried out to trip on.

Has somebody already had this idea? Because I have definitely read a newspaper article about chocolate being crushed and snorted in clubs!

Alcohol cannot be the go-to drug for modern humans forever more? I don't drink any more, I just can't. I'm in my 30s and I just find it boring. I like the taste of interesting craft beers and I could get into wines with some effort I guess, I just dont want to. I feel those days are behind me and as I get older, I wouldntind something stimulating . In this futuristic world where underground chemists were making interesting new compounds to get round the bans, don't you think we should be granting companies approval to clinically study and develop much SAFER customised, alcohol alternatives that over 21s can choose to buy. We have the ability to program ceiling levels into drugs - subutex and, even codeine to a degree doesnt get you more wrecked the more you take, the effects top out at a certain ingested miligram range.

Its already well established that alcohol is literally the most dangerous drug ever in terms of short term crazy reactions and long term health implications. I just don't see why we aren't allowed to develop fun drugs. Not everyone can drink, some people are natural alcoholics, others allergic or simply terrible drunks. These reported deaths and hospitalizations from legal highs were miniscule in comparison to drink and most likely down to poor education, even bad batches (legal, but still unregulated)

I'd be very interested to see the ER alcohol admittance rate after the ban to see if it has gone up proportionally since the ban.

I could talk about this forever. My views on drugs aren't personal, they are purely factual. The number one fact is that you are NEVER going to stop anybody wanting to experiment. We are conscious beings, shit, even without chemicals, people have formed religions trying to reach nirvana through chanting and meditation, even yoga. People are obviously willing to risk their freedom for the personal freedom to choose what they do with their own brain and body. Having our choices made for us is not in the interest of public safety, its removes freedom and forces it to become a money issue in the hands of unscrupulous criminals. The current fentanyl epidemic proves that because people are dying at an unprecedented rate. Even looking at heroin, for all the stigma associated with it, ironically every danger associated with it is not even from the drug. They stem from addiction - which basically means an inability to financially support a habit and turning to crime. Disease from shared equipment because of a lack of government harm reduction and OD from not knowing what you're buying because its illegal!

Its been made so complicated.. but haven't those decriminalised test countries been massive successes? Everything I've read has been about the plummeting addiction rates due to the taxation going to education and clinics.

-

Wow, so.. Somebody replied and asked ""Why do you see drugs as a .necessary part of life.""
  

  
What a question. It sounds like something a right wing judgemental perfectly content with the current regime kinda person would say. Like.. well I don't need to experiment, that sounds bad, why would you do that. I don't want you to? Its exactly this attitude that holds back every field of discovery. From science even.. back to drugs - New studies that have been only recently allowed thanks to persistent scientists that had to jump through regulatory hoops for years - we've only just found out MDMA treats PTSD Psilocybin provides comfort and treats existential fears of death in terminal patients and also in addition to other psychedelics helps in addiction and along with ketamine, is a being hailed as a miracle find for treating chronic treatment resistant depression. I wonder if it will come out that people stuck on opiates are fundamentally missing something that it helps replace, hence knowing its bad for your life and finances but you just gotta have it, it would account for the insane relapse rates and people that recover ending up OBSESSED with their new fix. I'm sure we can think of a few people that drop opiates only to get super heavily into whatever they do instead (even AA and meetings become something to obsess over with some people).

Aaaanyway. Why do I see drugs as a necessary part of life? Well, try acid one time and tell me it didn't entirely shift your point of view on life, the universe and everything. Its like The circle in Flatland or Plato's cave. I've seen outside and there's no way of convincing you what its like unless you go there yourself.

I do not know a ton about hard core drugs. I can take it or leave it. But give me a beer and I won't stop drinking for a month. I no longer drink it's been two years. 

I do IV Meth ever two months. I have a good friend that drives two hours to hang out. He does IV meth 3x a day and he looks like a normal person guy with no sores.. No picking.. Talks like a normal person.. Perfect weight and muscle..no weird movements.. He's been doing this for a couple years even too. He's so sexy! I've actually never done his with anyone else but him. And if we ever stop hanging out I will probably never think about it again. 

Ok so he does the injecting on me. I refuse to learn because Its gross and when he is inspecting my arms I feel kind of dumb. I don't know how he talks me into it with our visits. I don't know about measurements or how much water or shit he uses. But he has used the same stuff and same amount from what he tells me anytime. I'm not very experienced or understand it. But I like to ask questions. 

I forgot to take my Zoloft for a day.  But always take it on time every day. But I was switching it to taking at night instead of morning. Off the routine you can forget. I've taken 150 mil Zoloft for three years now. Love it. No anxiety and I feel like me. 

The rush has been great everytime I don't do anymore then one shot and then maybe a 2nd if I feel like it. Usually the rush is so much less 8 hours later same amount. and that's my favorite. So sometimes more is just a waste for me and I skip it. And see my friend back for a visit in a couple months. The time before I hardly had the rush. I wasn't too super excited. I get thinking about how good it feel and wanting or thinking about it the next day or two. But then I don't care. 

So, he said there is just a little more in mine but should really feel a difference. I am probably annoying I ask so many questions and then don't listen because he's trying to find my vein which he does perfect everytime. But i get scared he will miss and fro, what I read it hurts. Usually when he is completely done with me. He pulls the needle out and I always say "" I don't feel anything "" and it hits me. This time he was t even dome and the rush was awesome and 50% stronger rush than any of the other times. My throat and chest I could feel it. And that feeling didn't go away for 8 hours the rush stayed up with me a little bit the whole time. So intense I'm the two hours. 
Did another shot and it felt exactly the same and again rush still hung on. Normally it's about 1/2 the rush feeling as the first one. 
Only thing is when I stood up and would walk a bit I would start to faint. Never got that before. Think my blood pressure went low sitting down laying down and talking I was fine. I almost was more relaxed though and I could just sit or lay there feeling good. Anyone experience the faint almost everytime you stood up for five hours? 

So did the Zoloft decrease the effectiveness? I saw so many things that it decreases it. It won't work at all (I know that's not true).. It's dangerous and then Zoloft doesn't effect it at all. Anyone know which one is it? And if it's not the Zoloft why so different both times. He is the dealer and makes it the same everytime. If he does have something a little different he will tell me the details and I pretend I'm excited about it but I don't really know what he is saying. 

I think I STILL feel it in my throat and I'm sober feelin now. It's kind of cool. I'd really like to know so In two months if I just don't take Zoloft for a day I'll be fine. ",1469294667.0

She uses too, only via IV though, whereas I'll mix-up smoking and IV. So one of the nights she's there I mix-up a shot for her. She's fine for like ten minutes we are smoking and talking. Then next thing know she is unresponsive and not breathing. I perform CPR for about ten to twenty minutes. IDK really I was panicking and lost track of time because this is my best friend here, I love this girl. I am on the verge of calling ems, the only thing stopping me is that the CPR is making her breathe, and she has a one year old baby (was not at the house at the time,) but I didn't want her to lose her kid. She comes out of it outta nowhere and all is good. So she leaves the next day and for some stupid reason she had stuffed a bag of rigs in the couch, which my roommate found. My roommate thinks they are my rigs which causes all sorts of problems. Luckily my SO believes me that they were not mine. Now she doesn't want me to have any contact with my best, and one of my few friends. My SO also put me on this probation thing where basically in her mind we are not together and wil not be until she sees some kinda positive change in me. Eff dat, I'm a codependent motherfucker and she ain't gonna be rid of me that easy, I love this girl to death, to the point where I agreed to basically cutoff my best friend for her. I'm honestly on the verge of saying fuck everything, dipping out and living by myself selling dope so I won't fuck with anyone else's lives anymore.

Now I've tried it before, tried to get that OP down into powder to IV it. Got to the part where you're supposed to microwave it, and I ended up blowing the plate up into pieces. Sounded like a gun went off in my kitchen.  No Bueno señor. 

So my question is this. Has anyone successfully been able to either snort, smoke, or shoot an OP oxy?

So 7 or so years ago I fell 30 feet and suffered an L4/L5 spinal injury.  4 of my vertebrae were crushed, I was in surgery for 6 hours while 4 screws were put into my spine.  I spent 6 weeks in the hospital and inpatient rehab, it was almost 8 months until I could walk without the use of crutches.  I still have nerve damage in my legs and I'm unable to move my right leg below the knee.  Despite this and having to wear a brace around my ankle I've gotten pretty good at ignoring the pain for the most part, I'm actually pretty into bodybuilding (no calves and glutes because nerve damage, but what can you do, right?)

Anyway, here's the thing: my spinal doctor, who was the same man who did my surgery, has had me on VICODIN 7.5s for this injury.  Not even regularly, either.  Anytime I want a refill I have to set up an appointment and go ask him.  Having read some of the people here who are getting dilaudid and oxy for messed up knees and elbows and shit, I can't help but feel as though if I go through a pain management doctor I should be able to get something a bit better.

Before you caution me against going down this road, I've been using heroin for a couple years now.  I'm wondering if you guys think I'll be able to get something a bit better than fucking hydros based on the mangled 8 inch scar on my spine.  Anyone who has had a similar injury and can chime in as to their current scrips would be most welcome.

Also, I'm wondering if anyone can give me any advice on what I should say or how I should approach this.  I plan on explaining my late-in-the-game visit by saying I've been using marijuana to cope with the pain, but since I'm returning to a school in the deep south and on probation, that's going to have to stop (totally true btw).  Is it a mistake to admit marijuana usage?  What should I say to try to maximize my scripts?  I'd love to get some dilaudids, but if I could get a lucrative oxy script I'd be quite happy as well.

Thanks in advance for any help, happy nods!",1469420487.0

First I want to apologise for the dramatic title. Second I want to apologise to the wonderful people at Medically Safe Injection Centre (think I got that right) in Kings Cross, Sydney, for taking so long to make this post. I've been putting it off but some thing that happened the weekend before last (that I took a while to come to terms with) has prompted me to make this a two parter.

This is a harm reduction post, probably from the last person who should be giving advice on the subject. If you're not interested or think it doesn't apply to you then hit back but if you're the kind of person who has ever woken up surrounded by paramedics then this could be relevant. I’m sorry if it seems long, rambling or full of unnecessary information but I've included a lot of side detail in the first post to show that, although I was obviously extremely drug affected, my my memory wasn't affected. 

I was contacted by a redditor who was working at MSIC after I made a comment regarding a strange incident that happened to me. Apparently neither he nor the clinic head I met with (I believe it was) had heard of an incident exactly like this.

For setting; it was Friday and I'd just started a new job and been paid for my first half week. I'd also recently finished 7+ years on methadone and moved to suboxone for the final months and found that I only required a 1/3 of what I was prescribed as long as I kept myself occupied I had some brown 'european' type gear (no. 3) that I'd been hold since Tuesday night that I planned to have after work but because I was feeling so proud of myself for getting a job plus making it 7 work days without turning up pinned or pilled up that I decided to treat myself before work. I had a little taste of the approx. ¼ gram I had. The thing about European gear compared to the Golden Triangle sourced no. 4 in Australian (and I've heard a few Australians say this) is that although the initial rush is a lot different (and arguably much nicer) it has pretty weak legs. So much so that even though I'd shot the whole quarter before I left for work, I was stone cold sober before I was halfway to work. 

I had some benzos around lunchtime but this is pretty common for me. I've been scripted for years and am use to large doses. This was a fairly small dose by my standards, bigger than I'm prescribed, but not a 'get high dose'.  I knew I was going to get on again that afternoon but none of my contacts were holding. 

I ended up having to go through a friend of a friend in the X. It was extremely lucky it was there otherwise I wouldn't of bothered going to MSIC and just waited till I got home. If my roommate was doing his usual Friday activity (shooting meth) then he would have been holed up tweaking, either at his dealer's place or locked in his bedroom, so he wouldn't of noticed me (plus he was use to seeing me 'nod off' mid sentence then wake 15 minutes and continue then sentence I was on so he wouldn't of been alarmed if he saw me sprawled out). I told him to get 4 $50 caps and keep 1 for his effort. I planned on doing two (in hindsight even this was way too much) and keeping the third for later in the weekend (it was the weekend for grand finals for the two major football codes in Australia plus there was a Aus/NZ rugby test match on so it was looking like aq good weekend to be doing not much). Instead of 4 $50s he came back with 2 $100s, saying that because we're going for a shot together we can just split it as water. I don't like holding heroin as solution as I’ve read a lot of contradictory information on the subject of whether heroin converts back to (weaker) morphine when kept in a solution over time. This meant I had to have either $50 or the whole $150. After the disappointing legs on the first gear I decided, stupidly, to shoot the lot. What I wasn't to know was that the gear was some of the strongest that had got round anywhere in Sydney for a while (The X is known for the easily availability, definitely not the quality, of drugs)

I barely remember taking the fit out of my arm before I hit the deck. I've OD'd a few times at MSIC and on every other occasion I've at least thrown the fit in the disposal unit before dropping out however most have occurred 30-45 minutes after using, nodding out while spilling coffee all over the place (sorry for that one too guys). MSIC are great at dealing with ODs. They normally give you oxygen as a first measure as this brings most ODs around and they know how much we hate getting narcaned. I'm not sure if this was the case in my incident as they claimed it was a pretty serious OD.

I didn't even know I'd been hit. At that stage I'd never been narcaned before and assumed I'd wake up, if not hanging out, at least sober, but I was stoned as fuck. They kept me under observation a while but they can't keep you there and I'd had a friend waiting outside for ages so once I was confident I wasn't going to hit the deck again. It was approximately 6pm when I was narcaned.

I went home and chilled out. Didn't take any more opiates or pills and had maybe 2-3 bongs (very little by my standards). I was nodding hard but I was able to talk with friends (even though they all said I looked extra fucked up). 

Just before midnight I went to the local ice cream joint. The staff there know me and am used to see me looking pretty fucked up but they were pretty concerned at my state and told me to have a seat till I finished my milkshake. Next think I wake up to paramedics telling me I've just OD'd again.

This is the important bit. I OD'd at 6pm, was brought back with narcan then OD'd again 6 hours later despite not using any more opiods, benzos or alcohol.

The people I met with at MSIC said that then generally accepted danger period for a secondary OD to occur after narcan is 2 hours. Most medical professionals apparently think it is not possible to OD without using again after 2 hours. This was also the time period I'd heard mentioned.

So the important thing to take away from all this rambling is that you're not in the clear just because it's been more than two hours since you've been narcaned. You DON'T need to use more to OD again.

TL:DR; You can OD 6 hours after being revived by narcan even if you don't use more.

Part 2 – General arning about reckless behaviour.

The story above was the beginning of a rapid down hill slide for myself. As I previously stated, I had never been narcaned before that night. I've now been narcaned 5-6 times and woken up in hospital a couple times for benzo related misadventure in the same time period.

The weekend before last was a real wake up call though. It took me until Saturday just gone to fully process what had happened (and possibly could still) to me as a result.

I came into some nice coke, which is rare in Australia. Not the 'fire' that the local teenagers sell but stuff that was impressing people who'd used in Sth America in the 90s. I've also currently got a source for very, very pure smack (if it's not in the 90% range then it must have been made by Khun Sa himself) so I decided I'd have a speedball. 

Started shooting straight coke about 3.30pm. By about 5pm I was ready for that speedball. I mixed approximately 50mg of each and hit the deck almost immediately. When I woke up it was dark so I assumed it had been a while and I was ready to do the other 50mg of dope I had. Of course I again immediately dropped. This time I woke up just after midnight on (what I thought was) Friday night/Saturday morning. I had some massive blisters on my hand my immediately popped, resulting in massive scars, plus I was sore in 4 different places (two spots on the face, one each on the leg and chest) which were the result of being passed out on the floor but I've had problems with circulation related issues from heroin before so I wasn't too worried. I went on with my life for the next day and a half till my room mate got home on Sunday night. It turns out it was actually Monday night. I'd been unconscious for over 24 hours (and missed a job interview).

I don't know how the fuck I'm here to write this.

I was kind of in denial for the first few days. My room mate still thinks it was just benzo related as I used money for household expenses to pay for the smack and I was too ashamed to show them my wounds or describe my problems. Around Thursday I was checking how the 4 spots were healing when I realised that the spot on my chest wasn't from passing out with something digging into my side but was actually a lump under my skin (to the side of my heart). Combined with the circulation problems I was suffering and the huge wounds on my hand, the result was that I thought best case scenario I was in for major surgery, worst case I was going to lose my left arm.

I freaked out by myself for a few days before I finally showed my room mate my hand. The wounds were obviously infected by this stage. He gave me antibiotics and aloe vera to put on the wounds (which has worked surprisingly well and quickly). We put off going to the hospital as it was then Saturday night and full of drunks.

I still haven't been though. My wounds are looking a lot better and the pain cause by the lump in my chest isn't nearly as bad but I know I can't avoid it forever.

The main point of this second piece is just be careful. If you fuck up at the very least tell a friend or someone who knows you use and has some idea what can help. Ideally just go to a hospital and don't be a fucking pussy like me.

If you've made it this far I want to thank you for your time.

I cant find subs so im going to try to cold cop methadone.

Which it is.  But I have plenty of experience cold copping so thats not what im looking for advice on. Im just asking if im about to buy some liquid methadone from someone, are there any quick or easy ways to tell if its legit? what color should it be? What should it taste like? Are there any other indicators that its good? In the states its super easy to get subs but where I am its mostly still liquid methadone and I just dont even know what im looking for when I see the stuff. Thanks for any advice. 

**EDIT** Ok, since alot of you guys are posting info that I dont really need let me just add a few details to clarify some stuff. 

The reason I cant just sign up for MMT or a bupe program is because im american and ive been in Australia the last 6 months. On top of that I dont have insurance. So I cant just walk in to the clinic and say ""sign me up"". The reason I was going to cold cop it is because im going back to America in a little over a week and I need the methadone NOW, or very soon. Otherwise i would just keep doing dope until I eventually ran into some one w bupe or methadone . the reason I was asking about liquid methadone is because from what I hear, its much more prevalent here in sydney. I do know some people get bupe but im just going from what I hear when I ask around. *Of fucking course* im going to buy subutex, suboxone, or methadone tablets if I happen to run into those first. Im not just going out there to look solely for liquid methadone. However, since I dont know shit about liquid methadone and since from what I hear, thats what im most likely to run into, I wanted to have an idea of what im looking for and what may be an obvious scam that I otherwise would not have picked up on. Hence why I made this post. And I know that with liquid methadone people usually do a long taper but I just want it to help me come off this bender ive been on. If I can get enough to just get me through the worst 5 or so days it should work nicely for my purposes.

TL;DR  I just want to know about liquid methadone. ",1469415091.0

I just need to work through this, and would appreciate any and all help/advice you fine people have to give. I've posted here before and received generous help every time, but for the sake of this post I wish to remain anonymous hence the throwaway.

I'll begin by giving my use so far, I started only a couple months ago at the beginning of this summer. Researched, read reports, heeded the warnings and still decided to try heroin anyway. I've only ever snorted it, and never did enough to the point of getting withdrawals. 

A couple weeks ago I confided in my closest friend about my use.  Today he told his parents (who are like family to me) and they told my parents.  Shit storm ensued with my parents.  I understand all of this has happened because of how much people care about me, and they only wish the best for me.

I am going into my senior year of college, 3.4GPA, and then will have about 3 years of graduate school so in ~5 years I will be making six figures if all continues to go according to plan.

My parents want me to go see a professional to have them talk me out of ever wanting to do such an awful drug again.  I know it isn't this easy.  I know I have to want to never touch heroin again.  I think this is where the problem lies..

I still have my shit together, and what is the harm in doing a bag if I've had a long day?

Making the promise to everyone else to never touch it again is easy. Actually following through and not keeping the promise to myself is the hard part.  Even thinking about it now.. Never? Ever? That is such a long time especially when it is so easy. 

So what? Pick up another habit? Try Kratom or PST? Get addicted to those and still have problems? 

Is it when you can't imagine never having it again for the rest of your life when you have become addicted? If that is the case I'm addicted to literally everything in my life.

For once in my life I truly don't know what to do. I've seen that video a million times about how heroin is just nice. No hangover, feel great, no bullshit.

Why do our vices always give us so much pleasure? If I could do heroin every day for the rest of my life and have that feeling forever and not have it negatively impact anything then I'd absolutely do it.  Unfortunately something seems to always have to give.

I guess i'm just looking for a little support, from total strangers, when I have many family and friends who already give me plenty of support.

Get out while I'm ahead. I know. You'll ruin your life. Maybe. You'll throw away everything you have worked for and everything those who love you have given you. When? After one more bag a month from now? Two?

On the other hand I could get killed by someone texting and driving literally today. So I want to enjoy the life that I've had and every moment I am given. What better way to enjoy my existence than with some heroin once in a while? 

I know the risks. Everything in life is risky. You take a risk getting in your car every damn day. Hell, even getting out of bed in the morning is risky. So what's the point? To lead a fulfilled life and have a family?

I have plenty of hobbies. I am a very healthy individual. Exercise every day, work hard, be happy... That last part.. Be happy. Heroin makes me very happy. Every damn time, if only for a few hours.

Oh I have to find other ways to be happy? Okay I am a happy individual without heroin, but I still want it in my life.

I think this is most of what I wanted to say. My parents are making me give them all the drugs in my room which really isn't much but violates my trust so much. Though I suppose I violated theirs as well.

Sorry for any errors, don't have time to proofread at the moment, will make edits as needed later.

Any of your insight would be very appreciated.  Be frank with me.  Tell me what I don't want to hear..  But be honest is all I ask.",1469389889.0

After the madness of 10+ years of being dependent on opiates what hurts me the most is that I completely lost track of my career. 
I was visiting university but I wasn't able to get a degree.
The thing is before I got dependent I loved coding and I was good at it.
That's because I did not much else in my spare time.
Fast forward past the addiction:  To realise that I completely fucked up my life is hard. There's no recovering all these years.
That would be bad enough but I also feel unable to even the most basic work. It's like being sober alone drains me enough that I justdon't have the patience for nothing else. 

Really , if I had the money I'd go to Switzerland for some assisted suicide.

I like to keep my accounts at least fairly separate for their separate uses.  I have my DNM account, my real life account, my old gaming account, and of course the account where I can talk about anything I damn well please because I never access it within a mile of my living quarters, or on any device I own without using security precautions (yeah, cops aren't gonna be decrypting my files more likely than not.  But I'm a geek/junkie.  Paranoia comes with the gig).

Two days is when I have my birthday.  I've been trying to come COMPLETELY off of opiates (like, not even lope or kratom or anything else) so that, for one day, I can completely and totally enjoy them.  And not just feel normal, better, or less like I want to pass out every time I stand up. I wanted to be completely independent of them, ironically, so I could get a high that at least comes within shouting distance of those glorious first few months.  Where I live at, though, that's damn near impossible.  Most of the people who ask me for shit are either hella broke or Engineers--the South has a seriously crippling painkiller dependency issue--and I find myself helping them out because, even though I don't indulge too much anymore I still make a few bucks off the top.

And I ALWAYS come through.  It's not usually what they want, and we get robbed more often than I'd like to admit (I seriously wish there was an open air market here, would make my life so much easier), but as a 7.5 year addict it's something I, personally, am used to.  I have had to pay back a lot of people for shit I didn't do (no, I'm not in denial, I just stopped stealing shit after I almost lost my family over it.  I've done fucked up things) just so I didn't lose their friendships.

And now...on my birthday....I got nothing.  I can't locate a fucking tramadol to save my life, and Kratom was just made illegal in my state (so I can't even just eat a ton of that and get /some/ satisfaction).

All I wanted for my birthday was to be high--truly high--for one day.  And not have to spend 150-300 dollars (seriously almost moved to NJ so many times when I was young just because the thought of nodding for 20-50 bucks a day sounded so great), and with my tolerance gone a handful of Norcos would take care of that issue.

But nope.  Not on my birthday.

For a dopefiend who's been at it almost a decade, the thought of being sober on the one day when I allow myself to indulge myself makes me wanna go rob the nearest Walgreens.  Just what the fuck Karma?  Can't a guy get a break?  I'm not asking for a free bag of dope, just to be able to find something that doesn't cost too much and gets me where I wanna be.  Or close.

""SUGAR DADDY? - Single white male seeking single female for co-dependent relationship. Me = average age, average height, average weight, above average income. Looking for age 20-30 yr old female in need of support. Tired of wondering how you are going to feel well tomorrow?  Wonder no more, allow me to be your pillar of support, Narcan included. Send info to (redacted email).""

So, does this offend you? Surprise you? Interest you? Would anybody willing to respond, male or female, just change around what this person is looking for (i.e. Change 20-30 yr old female to 20-30 yr old male).  Also, change around the person seeking the relationship, what if it was a female looking?

The mention of Narcan makes it really damn specific what is being sought out here.  Anyway, cheers! peeps its a really crazy world, be safe!

I won't take heroin. I am not mad ;).  Just a little codeine, I have especially fond
memories of dihydrocodeine.

I need that reward. And if I achieved my goal I DESERVE it.
Been clean for 2+ years and nothing is truely rewarding like life
was before being an addict.
Thus I truely take charge of my disease. I don't want to call it a relapse because I will do it of my own free will as a long term reward.

I think opiates need to be treated with much care and should not be used in casual way. I'd never think of taking them every day; that is stupid in every way.
I think it's better to  cooperate with the disease than trying to shun it completely. Give it alittle outlet. Give it a little food. Because as TMBG put it best: ""starving the beast / will only make it stronger"".

Does anyone know what this cut is? It rarely happens, and it comes from my same reputable guys I always buy from. (If I was out copping I wouldn't put it past some crazy junkie to ***actually*** use mascara to bulk up their product).

Like tonight every shot that I do leaves this horrible residue in the spoon once I filter it... but the dope is still great quality. 

Note the BTH doesnt smell like mascara pre-cook... and isn't especially hard or soft. Also, this isnt pill binders or pill casing residue...

I just wondered if anyone knew what chemical it is that smells and acts like mascara...or is it just something that can happen if the cook of the product gets effed up or someone adds to little or too much of xxxxx?

This is fiction, based loosely on true events. This is for entertainment purposes only. This is not written to muddy the truth, tell my story, or complicate legal matters. Its only meant to entertain, and serve as a warning.

Failed the UA. Well, fuck me. Its been days. Literally days. I was doing ice and down in big quantities though, and I've been curled up in a ball of sick on the drunk tank floor since I got here. Not sleeping, not eating. I guess it makes sense somehow. Maybe tomorrow.

Feeling bad for me (maybe) or because I showed signs of life, I'm finally brought into gen pop. Right into pod 1, which is also on lockdown. Life just gets better and better.

As I walk into A pod with the kickin junky crew, I spot a few more friends. But, the pods on lockdown. So into my new cell I go. As I approach my new cell I see two black guys mean muggin me. I know a lot of people around here, but I don't know them. Fuck it, I walk into Brandon's cell before him and close and lock the door. Per my design, he takes the floor spot in a 2 man cell turned 3 man next door.

My new cellie is a huge white guy, who's oddly familiar. He says ""hey"" as I get my shit in order.

""Where you from?"" He asks.


""Here."" I tell him.


He smiles. ""Me too. There's a lot of us locals in this pod. We look out for each other. And run this place.""


""Good to know man. Im dopesick though. Soo uh.. You have an extra book? I just spent four days on the intake floor with nothing. I can't sleep. I will try and be quiet at night though so I don't keep you up.""


""Oh shit man, you came to the right cell. My last celly left me a dozen books. So you're good."" He tells me. Finally some luck.


I pass the long sleepless night reading mediocre crime novels. The hours and minutes drag on. I catch a few 20 minute cat naps here and there, but I can't really sleep. My celly however sleeps the next 12 hours away. Which is good, because I can't sit still. I'm anxious to get out, almost shaking at times. My mind won't settle. I haven't eaten, but I keep thinking about a bigass bowl of fried rice, a soda, and a kamel red. After a shot of course. At times through the night I can't even focus on reading.


Morning comes, and I hear the pod door pop. Three trustees come in with a CO, to serve breakfast. I wake my celly when they pop our door.


""You're eating today?"" Asks Mantis, the Latino trustee. He gives me a grin and a wink, as he slips me what turns out to be an extra hard boiled egg and pad of peanut butter. Two pieces of bread and a 4 oz cup of orange juice completes my ""meal"". I trade my celly my bread for his juice, and greedily eat the peanut butter and drink the juice. Sugar tastes absolutely tits. I force down one egg, but it just tastes like withdrawal. Like stale mushrooms or something, I can't explain it. My celly accepts the other two. 


After breakfast I'm riding that button like a two dollar whore.

""Yes?""

""Krew tans, just need to take a UA to make bond.""  I state.

""Do you have money on your books?"" Bitch on the button asks.

""Uh, not sure. Do I?"" I ask.

""I will check. You're going to need $5 to take a UA.""

Shit...

Throughout the day I keep riding that button, drinking copious amounts of water, and forcing down a few sporkfulls of shitty food. I keep hitting a wall. Do I have money on my books? I'm not sure, I've been locked in a cage for so many fucking days I haven't needed any. Sometimes they tell me how busy they are, and promise to check into my situation ""later"". Which means, maybe the next shift will.

After lunch, I hear the pod door pop, as well as my door. A voice on the intercom crackles, and I almost lose it! Except - they say my name wrong. 

""Brandon, come to the blue line."" Wait.. Fuck! That's right, I took his cell.

""Wrong cell, he's in 1a. By the way, this is tans. Can I get a UA?"" I ask.

""Later.""

""Thanks cunt."" I say graciously.

After dinner, yes dinner, I'm allowed out for an hour to shower, move around, and make phone calls. I take what turns out to be a pretty cold shower, but it feels good to be clean and change. I run up to top tier to hit up my buddy.

""Hey krew, what are you in here for?"" Van asks.

""Just possession. Heroin allegedly. Hey, I need to call someone.. Can I get a phone card off you?"" I ask, hoping.

""Yeah man, can you make it local?"" He asks. ""Its three bucks a call for long distance, but only a quarter a minute local.."" Says the guy I last saw with over 70k in his safe. Shit..

""Umm.. Yeah. I can do that."" I say hesitantly. The only local number I know.. Is my parents.

He slides the note under the door, and I run down the tier to make a phone call. A few peeps I know pound on their windows as I run past, but fuck em. This is important.

I call my parents house after a few minutes of figuring out the system. My mom answers.

""Hello?""

""Hey mom, so, you're not going to believe this, but I'm in jail.""

""Yeah we know."" She's not amused.

""Yeah, uh, how?""

""Marie told your sister. You just disappeared. There is all this news of overdoses and.."" She trailed off. Oh - shit. I forgot about that. Fuck, they must have been worried.

""Well, sorry. Anyway, I need five bucks to bond out. Er, ten.. Fifteen maybe. I have to pass a pee test. I-""

""You have money on your books."" She cuts me off.

""Wait - what?"" 

""When you're arrested, any money you have is placed on your books. Your sister put some on there too to be sure. She did that Sunday.""

""Oh shit, cool, thanks mom. I gotta go, I need to take a UA.""

""OK, well, come here when you get out."" She tells me.

""Be my first stop mom"" I say, half sarcastically. 

I run to my cell, and bang the fuck out of that button.

""YES?"" the bitch on the button exclaims.

""Look, I have money on my books. I know I do. So I want to take a UA."" I say, a little heated.

""We are busy now, we don't work on your time."" She tells me.

""I've been asking all day, getting the runaround. I've tried being nice, assertive, and even begging. All I hear is later. Its later."" I begin to yell toward the end.

Silence....

I run the paper up to my friend, and give him his phone card back. I fill him in a little on my situation, and ask about his.

""I saw your shit on the news.."" I say ""you've been in here since?""

""Yeah. Seventeen months now.  I'm taking it to trial, but my attorney and the States keep continuing it. I got 38 felonies dropped to 12 now, but the serious charges are still there. But - I'm gonna win. If they don't keep dragging out the trial, and the lawyer fees. Shit."" He tells me. 

Damn, seventeen months in here? I don't know if I could do a week.

I ride that button like a rented mule. Finally, shift change, and a new voice. I politely state my issue, and hear a response.

""Its almost 11pm, you haven't taken a UA yet today?"" She asks incredulously.

""Uh, no. They kept telling me later. After breakfast, after lunch, after dinner, after shift change."" I say.

""We are very busy right now, I'm sorry, but I promise you I will take care of this as soon as we are able."" The angelic voice tells me. I think I'm in love..

About 45 anxious minutes of chugging water later, the pod door pops. My celly would be annoyed with my constant button riding if he were conscious.

My cell door pops, and I hear ""tans, blue line."" Sweet!

I damn near run to the blue line, grinning in spite of my circumstances. I'm greeted by a huge Libyan. ""Time to take a UA."" He says in his choppy accent.

I follow him to a bathroom, and he peter hawks the shit out of me. Whatever. I damn near fill the cup with the middle of the urine stream, cap it and hand it to him.

After a minute he shakes his head. ""Says you fail for Opium."" He says.

""That's impossible, I only failed for meth."" I lie. ""Let me see it?""

He shows it to me, and there's a very, very faint double line on the opiates. That should be a pass. ""Oh look, it says I failed for PCP too! This test is bullshit."" I lie. Im hoping after a few minutes the line will darken. I think UAs work like that. I hope..

""Oh no, it says you pass for PCP."" He tells me.

""Really? Can I see?"" I ask. He shows me again. I study it closely, and slowly.

""No, there's two lines for opiates."" I tell him. He looks closely at it.

""I only see one."" He tells me.

""Tilt it in the light"" I suggest.

""Sorry, you failed. It can take, maybe a month for opium to get out your system. So maybe try in a few days.."" He suggests.

Nooooo.... ""Hey, can you show your sergeant the UA? Maybe they see the two lines, like I do."" I suggest.

""Hmm. Wi!l that make you happy? So I can bring you back to your cell, and we can stop looking at your pee?"" He asks.

""Very happy."" I tell him.

""OK let's go. You failed though, she is going to say the same thing.""

As the cell door closes behind me, I climb up into my bunk, dejected. Fuck! I grab my book, and start reading again.

A voice comes on the intercom. ""Tans?""

""Yep."" I state, pissy. Ready to hear I failed.

""Grab your shit, you're out.""

I walk up 5 blocks, take the train into town, go 3 blocks over, and my plug is always standing on the steps, chilling. His name is Kermit, short for, ""Kermit the Frog"" short for, ""Kermit the frog from, The Muppets take Manhattan"", but everybody just calls him Kermit.

It usually goes like this, ""Hey Kermit, you got dat boi?"" and he says, ""Yeah, how many?"" and I say, ""2 bags,"" and he says, ""Aight, 40"" and I hand him the money and say, ""Here comes dat boi!!!"" then he hands me the bags (pink ones with a pig's face on it) and I walk 2 blocks over, to the CVS and ask to use the restroom, and I pour the bags into a baggie of Pop Rocks and eat it. 

Anyways, today, I do my regular routine, walk, get on the train, walk again, and when I roll up to where Kermit usually is, there's a different guy standing there.

Kermit is a 6'2"" black guy with some teeth and he weighs about 275. This is a white guy, about 5'5"", more teeth, and he has really short cropped hair with a mustache and is wearing aviator style sunglasses.

I figure, ""Hey, my plug had to take a leak, so he left his friend to do his business for him."" So I go through the regular routine, 'cept I don't know this dude's name, so I make up one. ""Hey, Whitey Ford Sings the Blues, you got dat boi?"" and he says, ""What do you mean?"", and I say, ""Dat BOI!"", and he says, ""I know you're talking about a drug, but which drug?"" and this freezes me. Cuz I normally don't tell people what drug I do, I just call it ""dat boi"". But I decide that if Kermit trusts this guy, then I should, so I say, ""Heroin, I'd like some heroin please, Whitey Ford Sings the Blues."" I get excited when he says, ""Oh, Heroin, diacetylmorphine, yes, please come with me.""

So, we walk down the alley, him 2 steps in front of me, and he's on the phone, but I can only hear one part of the conversation. ""Yeah, I've got one."" ""Moron."" ""2 minutes."" ""It'll be the best thing for him.""

I hear that last one, and I'm like ""Great, he's got dat good good boi!""

So, at the end of the alleyway he says, here, put these bracelets on. So he gives me these shiny metal bracelets that are sort of tied together with other metal, and tells me, ""Just wait right here.""

So, now I'm standing here waiting, and I'm asking you guys to let me know. Would you trust this guy?",1469492208.0

After 8 years on opiates/opioids = 2 years of codeine, than x months on pst and codeine,than methadone (home detox), tramal for x months and more than 3 years of being on buprenorphine (sublingual) I decided to try morphine i.v. (i.v. for the first time in my life). I was sure that I would be taking bupe as always the following day. No way... Precipitated withdrawal occured and it was the most painful kind of withdrawal in my life (I wish I had known about something like that before...) I decided to end my stuff [about 6-8 200 mg morphine pills] and found a methadone treatment center (being absolutely determined to end all of this shit forever and never ever be addicted again, thinking ""yay, I will be free from bupe and morphine, I'll never take codeine again and will be free forever"" - oh, imagination) where really stupid assholes were giving me ~120 ml of 1 mg/1 ml syrup for a month, and than kicked me out in about 3 weeks because of my benzodiazepine addiction which is also something my private doctor were perscribing to me because of my real problems. When my methadone-doctor saw that I'm not able to end taking it, he decided to make me sober by tappering -5 ml a day or 10 ml/after every 2 days etc. On 30 ml's I went on morphine again, because of the pain and my stupid ideas. shame Than I was taking it till my boyfriend got to USA. Before he did that I was trying to get 'cold turkey' from ~600 mg a day. It was like an exorcism to me, failed after 3 days. So, from April till the 11th of July i got to ~150 mg of morphine by myself (and teached myself how to do an injection) Than I went on a quick methadone recovery: 1st day - 20 mg 2 - 15 mg 3 - 15 mg 4 -10 mg 5 - 5 mg 6 - 5 mg 7 - last day, should be 2,5 mg Then, things with my boyfriend got very bad (it's all about cheating and everything that hurts the most), I know it was just a reason to take it, but I took about 100 mg of morphine + 20 mg of Oxycodone and till today I was taking it (consumed: 8 x 200 mg pills of morphine + 2 x 80 mg Oxy's in 7 days).

Now I really want to get rid of this vicious circle or get on buprenorphine again (maybe it's the safest way? to take it from the smallest doses and taper it very slowly and also be able to work, live, you know). I've got only 3 tabs of Tramadol 200 mg and after 3 days I want to switch it to buprenorphine. Would it work? Will I have a withdrawl because of taking morphine for 7 days in a row? I'm so scared... What should I do ? Please, help me. Hugs, Susan. ",1469485840.0

It was going to be a rough night. It's late.. I'm pushing my luck on a Monday night, I already scored this morning and its at the point where they're switching off, unless they also sell hard white, I assume their peak times are when everybody else is asleep between midnight at 3am.

So, I just got the funds together and I'm walking back to my home. It's 2 roads away, less than 3 minutes walking. I phone the guy who was definitely around earlier. Phone swiched off. I phone my number two, he's a LONG walk away, its an hour and twenty round trip but slightly more worth it that the first guy - it depends on how I feel and if the extra time is worth it or I'm too desperate! No answer. I stand on the corner of the entrance to my road, I alternate calling between one and two and both turn up nothing.
The chills have started, I sneeze, it's going to be a long night so I think about what I need to do in order twaste 10 hours until I get that familiar, comforting text in the early morning ""On"" 9am if I'm lucky, up to 11.45am if they're lazy and haven't got their shit together. I have no idea what time they get up. have their conrnflakes, wrap their balloons, take a shower and drop text everyone in their contact list.

I start to walk home, thinking how much its gonna be a rough night.

Out the corner of my eye I see two figures in an alley next to where I'm standing. I cross to the opposite side of the road so they can get on with what I think they're doing. One black guy, fresh tracksuit, shiny new trainers. The other guy, clothes falling apart, dirty unwashed hair and face, the black guy shoves a plastic bag back into his pocket.

I cross back over and wait by the exit to the alley, far enough away not to spook them. When they exit, I stare straight at them with a dopey look on my face, trying to look as harmless as I can.

The black guy points at me. ""Whos this guy, you know him"".. ""Nah""..
Shit. You get one chance at this. I revert to my best Hugh Grant style.
""Hi, I don't mean to disturb you, I noticed what was going on, and I'm needin' myself""
""Whatcho needin'?""
""2 Dark""
""Yeah, my mans here will serve you"" he got into the passenger side of a car that I hadn't even noticed was running and he sped off. The dirty man said 'Hey follow me' He was more posh than even I try and be. I have no idea why recently when I'm meeting new people, I go the exact opposite of their rudeboi London speak-tingz and go beyond undercover cop and straight to - there's no way this guy is that obvious an undercover. I've been turned away from trying to be gangsta, I just can't pull it off. But wicked posh. Nowt issues!

I consider the fact I'm about to lose my money, but he makes me call him so he's got my number first, asks where I'm heading, what I do. General questions. No alarm bells. All good. ""In the phonebox"" We cram inside together, I swaps my moneys for a BIG bag. It's almost too big, like its fake and hasn't been weighed. It's not wrapped in paper either, its a clear plastic bag and I can see dust and brown rock. At this point, its a either real or a very good fake, colour, consistency.. effort has gone into making it.

He wishes me well, I'm basically outside my house now. I go in, test on foil. Real deal! Little shot to test. It's all good!

SHIT! So, my previous cold copping record from my house was 40 minutes! I posted that stort previously on here as well. This is a new record, less than 5 minutes and I was already heading home from a couple roads away.

It was only last weekend I was thinking to myself how many people I've known and know now that sell Heroin from the 5 years I've lived here. And when I've been in the homeless community, I've heard other names like, ""I'll call 'Justin', 'Frosty', 'Jimbob', 'Sanhez', 'Goose'"" So, in this fairly small city (more of a big town really for the amount of people that live here)I have personally known of perhaps 30 names. I really wonder how many people individuals are selling it in this city! 

Another interesting thing is that each batch from each dealer is different (colour, texture etc.) so how many suppliers are there? I'd love to know more about the supply chain - knowing the end results of the flow from growing and making, smuggling and cutting (unfortunately) and cooked into my veins.. nothing if fascinating!",1469482574.0

All of last year I was using a lot of coke. Every weekend almost all weekend. I couldn't enjoy a night out without it. I spent a lot of fucking money on it. I thought I was addicted to it but I didn't do anything about it.

My friend was using H with his coke and he recommended I try it. I wanted to try it on its own before mixing the two. Since then I haven't touched coke much. I'd rather spend my money on H. I thought I was addicted to coke but I don't think so now because it was very easy to quit.

I'm a little bit concerned with how often I think about using heroin and how quickly tolerance goes up with it. That said, its cheaper then my coke habit, I feel a million times better then I did when I was using coke so often.

I want to use H a little more often but I haven't because I'm worried about addiction. However, I think I'm being overly cautions of addiction because I thought I was with coke and it turns out I wasn't.

I've made a throwaway for this, as i use a completely different sub mostly, and a few of the people their know me in every day life.

Now, like I said i'm not a user, but i read through this sub every day. 
The reason i find myself on here every day is that I had a pretty hard upbringing. I won't go into detail, as i'm sure a lot of you guys experienced the same or worse. I'm on here because i found myself relying on drugs (mainly Vicodin) maybe 4 years ago. I started using a lot, but i'm lucky one of my siblings pulled me into line, and helped me deal with a lot of the stuff i don't talk about (being my sibling they went through the same thing).
I come here because i empathize with you guys. I enjoy reading a lot of the stories on here, and every time someone gets clean i'm happy as hell for them! 
Reading this sub helps me feel not so alone in every day life. I know that there are people dealing with problems that i have had, and don't have every single day. And what i see is a large group of people who come together like a family online. I guess that's what i crave and enjoy most. Even though i don't post, i feel like i'm part of a group of people who actually care about each other, and don't judge, even when others do (that's the big one). 

You guys really have a good thing going on in this sub. And while i hope everyone here gets clean, i know life is hard as fuck. I walked a very fine line with addiction, and i feel lucky that i didn't fall in too deep. 
Sorry for the soppy post, but the guy who posted before saying he doesn't sympathize with anyone, and comes here for entertainment pissed me off. I wanted to let you guys know that as a lurker, i'm here for a completely different reason. The right one really.

Tl;dr
Pissed off at guy who said he lurks 
I'm a lurker for different reasons
thank you guys
you all help me a lot, even though you don't know it.

I was confident for as I'm on methadone and had taken over the contour cidiene for a toothache but had not used heroin for 6 days last Wednesday afternoon through till yesterday morning. My test results were positive for 6mam which is definitively heroin isn't it. It's my first time with one off these tests the usual opiot tests come back cleat after 5days max. I know 6mam has a short detection time so how is this possible?? Also they sent off a swab syliva test for the same 6mam after 6days this must be going to come back OK surely ??

Anyways I decided to binge for my 18th birthday but it ended up fucking me over. Long story short family found out and I got kicked out of home. Fast forward three weeks, And I've found somewhere permanent to live and have annual leave to pay rent till I start work again. (fam hasnt given up on me, they're supportivr but are drug testing me)

I've been internally debating whether life is worth it or not a lot lately, is there anything better than heroin in life? 
I decided yesterday that I wanted some more dope, but I just got paid and all that money went to paying rent.

I'm sorry for rambling, I'm just don't see the point of living an average life growing old and dying. I'd rather just stretch being a functional dope user as long as I can (maybe a few years) and then just intentionally OD when it starts to get bad.

I used to shoot heroin but haven't taken any opiates in about 4 months, some diluadid just fell into my lap and I've always wanted to try it so I did. I know that the BA on the stuff is abysmal so I decided to bang it (I used heroin for 3 years and shot for the last year so I know I got a vein and got that part right at least) but I've never shot a pill before so that's where I think I went wrong. 

I ground 2mg up super fine (small dose but I have 0 tolerance right now and I wanted to start small), and dissolved it in a spoon. Most of it dissolved right away so I didn't apply heat, there was some gunk floating around but not a ton, I reckon it was just binders and crap. Put in my cotton, pulled it up, registered in my arm, and banged it waiting for that diluadid rush I've heard so much about. And then-

My muscles went super rigid, like my neck, biceps, calfs, thighs, even my hips tightened up like I grabbed an electric fence again, my head hurt from the pressure in my neck. I panicked for a second and thought my muscle and sinew was going to remove itself from my bones.

It lasted a few harrowing moments and then faded. I'm still sore 15 minutes later, like I ran hard without stretching but it's not as acute as before, mostly just an unpleasant reminder that I'm not high & laying on my couch happy as a pig in shit.

So what the hell happened guys? Did I fuck up the shot and send something other than diluadid up my arm? Is this just how some people react to diluadid? Did I do enough to get side effects but not high? I have more & I don't want to do that again, but it also seems a damn shame to have to send it up my nose and waste half of it.

**Tl;dr:** I tried diluadid for the first time, shot 2mg with 4 long & sober months of tolerance, got incredible muscle rigidity and pain without any real opiate euphoria. Pupils are small but not completely pinned, heart is faster than average but that might be a reaction to the pain. No idea why & I really want to get that diluadid rush but don't want to feel that muscle pain again. Anyone know what happened?

He let me move into his place, where him and my sister could help me get clean. We got me into a methadone program, and after a rocky start, I went 13 months with clean UAs, having dropped dope entirely.

Around a month ago, I began to plan a move. I was moving from Sacramento, CA, to San Antonio, TX. And I started on the transfer to a clinic in SA. However, I got evicted a month and a half earlier than I had planned for, so I had to pack up as much of my shit into my little '96 Chevy Cavalier two door (which was made even more difficult with my 5 and a half foot python and his tank on the back seat) the day before I left, hit the clinic first thing the next morning, and get on the highway and go.

Starting the third day of the four day long drive, I started getting sick. That night, I stopped in El Paso and copped some dope, enough to get me to San Antonio. And it did. I missed the first week's intake (5am-6am on Mondays and Tuesdays only? What the?), so I had to go the next week, copping dope in the meantime to stay well, and I got in today and got my first dose (though they start at a real low dose at first and slowly increase it, which sucks). 

So, I'm gonna do what I haven't been able to do for 13 months: have a little fun. Nicotine, weed, alcohol, methadone, and dope. I've only got like a point, maybe two of dope (that I'm smoking; I am NOT getting sucked back into needles), and my methadone was only 10mg today, but I want to get a good buzz on for just one evening, and then back to finish the program. Hell, I'm already halfway through my taper, and as they increase my dose daily, I'm gonna have them stop at the lowest mg that evens me out enough to work.

Anyways, I'm rambling. I just know some of you were concerned about me, and I wanted to update y'all. I'm going right back into a program because it was *working*, and I've felt great this past year. I've got real hope of actually getting *FINALLY* clean. Also, I've got a couple job interviews in the next few days, so I'm hopefully gonna be getting more and more settled here in Texas (which I still can't get used to; it was over 90 degrees yesterday evening, but it was suddenly storming out of nowhere: pouring rain, strong-ass winds, and crazy fucking lightning. In July. Wtf is this place?). Anyways, thanks as always, my familia here in r/opiates.",1469586549.0

Havent stole anything besides a lighter cause I needed one. Well I've been sick as a dog. No job. Family won't give me money because they know i use. So today i said fuck it. Went to Walmart and hopped on GameStop.com. Every single thing in that gaming isle that didn't have a spider wrap on it, I searched the value. Until I found that Wii controllers sell for 20$ each. Fuck. Here we go. Without even a though I shoved 4 of them in a basket, hustled to the nearest isle with no camera and did my work. Walked all the way home with a bag full controllers in this 90° heat, then i realize I got the wrong controllers. These are worth 7$.

Did they see me last time? Are they watching me now that they know i stole? I never steal from the same place twice unless I know for a fact im safe. Fuck it I'm desperate. Grab 4 more of the right one and bust em open all the same. Tomorrow I'm going to a Walmart across town for roind.. 3? I'm not gonna say im professional at this, but I'm very quit and know what im doing. Never been caught stealing anything besides a slushy when I was 10.

I feel like an old man saying that. I spent my childhood tirelessly exploring the internet on my 1.4 kbps dial-up modem (when 5.6kbps came out it was straight fire). I like to think that I used to know a thing or two. Now I'm old(er) and use it for boring things... amazon, an occasional torrent, and a modest amount of porn. A reddit user (and listener) suggested I post on here. I won't say who in case he wants to remain nameless. I was surprised I already had an account- then I remembered that I posted "" Is it impossible for something to be not possible?"" on ELI5 when I was bored one night. They took it down, but I really enjoyed the in depth answers to the totally retarded question.

Anyways, I started using drugs right about the same time dial-up was phasing out. I scoured the internet for every fact I could read about every substance and became a horrific drug addict. I started with really pushing the limits with hallucinogens, and ended as a run-of-the-mill junky, alcoholic, cokehead. By run of the mill I mean years in jail, psych wards, overdoses, and over a dozen rehabs. Now I am sober and love to laugh about the crazy pastime. I find a real satisfaction in making light of a heavy subject. Some may say it is irresponsible....

You can find my show on iTunes, Podbean, or a bunch of other places. Just search for ""Dopey."" If you have a funny story, we love reading emails on the podcast. The person who told me to check out reddit posted on here before and there was some criticism about my co-hosts constant interjections. Don't worry, he doesnt do that as much now.... we have found our grove. Besides, Dave is the man. Period. 

Thank you if you took the time to read this post. I have a tendency to be a little verbose. Anyways take care. Dopey Nation stay strong!!

Chris 

P.S. I write for a few sites about drug addiction, mostly recovery mumbo-jumbo. I thought I would include a copy of an article I wrote for cracked because they didnt post it (and I thought it was kind of funny). Its about bizarre intoxication facts....




*Disclaimer* This article in no way advocates trying any of these ideas. In fact, if you are even considering doing so then you should probably remove yourself from the gene pool. 


Getting High On Your Own Supply
	
Have you ever smelled your own fart and thought, “ That smells kind of good?” It takes a rare person to acknowledge this sordid satisfaction, the delight that one receives from sniffing a strong batch of self-brewed flatulence. However, there exists a certain group of people who relish this world of debauchery and airborne fecal matter. The Jenkem addicts. 

Step One) Fill a bottle with piss and shit, Step Two) Let it ferment in the sun for a week, Step Three) Hit that shit! (inhale the fumes). A lungful of this devil fart is said to open the doors of perception, providing auditory and visual hallucinations for about an hour. Possibly originating in the streets of Zambia, this drug has spread across seas and has a subculture that is more bizarre than Juggalos. 


Heavy Drinkers Buy Super-Plus Tampax

	Boofing. Butt Chugging. Turkey Basting. Rectal administration of substances probably predates the suppository, but we can’t simply thank medical science for this newer drug jargon. We can thank the ingenious teenager who tirelessly works to beat the system and hide the stench of liquor. We can thank Al Gore for creating the internet and providing a public forum for such activities. And we can thank Mom and Dad for dutifully sniffing Johnny and Sally’s breath when they get home from the school dance. 

	Step One) Purchase tampons from your local drugstore, Step Two) Soak tampon in Vodka, Step Three) Insert up your rectum, Step Four) Say “Cheers!” On a side note, many intoxicants may be inserted up your rear for a rapid onset, high absorption, cost effective, and probably painful high. If only Freud were still alive to comment….


Zero Pump Chump

	Pfizer beware: Viagra no longer corners the impotence market. Not only does methamphetamine compete with the little blue pill, it outperforms it. Crystal meth, when administered intravenously at the proper dosage, can instantly produce ejaculation. No erection required. Why the pharmaceutical companies haven’t jumped on this is beyond me. Instead of “ Take one hour prior to sexual activity,” it could be “Take.”

	Step One) Purchase a large quantity of high-grade, shard-like meth, Step Two) Load syringe with massive dose of drug, Step Three) Squirt it in your arm, Step Four) Squirt your pants. Some people may argue that draining the beans without touching the frank isn’t the point of the barbeque, but I beg the differ. A nut is a nut, period.  


Fire up that Toad

	Were you an avid Family Guy watcher when the show still produced a few laughs, you may remember the episode about licking toads. Well, as they say, don’t believe everything you see on television. But in this case you can believe most of it. It turns out that the Bufo Alvarius toad secretes venom that contains a potent hallucinogenic known as 5-MeO-DMT. You can’t get off by simply licking this warty reptile, but if you milk its glands and smoke the dried extract, the journey is so profound it makes Jenkem pale in comparison. I wonder what would happen if you took a half rip of fermented feces and then finished it off with vaporized toad?

	Step One) Locate a Bufo Alvarius, aka Colorado River Toad, Step Two) Squeeze the poor thing’s nubs dry, just like you used to crank your whiteheads in the mirror, Step Three) Spark up the dried puss, Step Four) Say hello to the great beyond. Make it quick though because this rocket fueled trip only lasts a few minutes. 


Let me Jog my Memory with a few Beers

	It turns out I would have done better in college had I showed up for my exams drunk. A phenomenon known as state-dependent learning reveals that retrieval of memories is most efficient when the individual is in the same state as when the memory was formed. In other words, if someone studies drunk, he or she will actually perform better on a test if he or she is drunk. Perhaps I was privy to this information years ago, but I might have been sober when I learned it….

	Step One) Get drunk and learn things, Step Two) Do those things, drunk. The take home here: if you’re going to go through life drunk, you better keep at it!",1469585745.0

Well...I was driving around to get food when I stopped at one of the regular red lights where the homeless approach you. Next thing you know I have the idea of waving one over, it was a pregnant women in her mid 30's. Hand her a quarter and as if she knows any D boys. Immediately tells me yes. I pull around and meet her in a parking lot she explains the deal and says hell be here in 20 minutes. Meanwhile I go get my food and come back in 20 minutes. When I get back she hops in my car and takes me behind Wendys. Now I am nervous as hell as I have been robbed and you know its cold copping so... Plus she's middling me but I paid her 20 bucks on top of the 80$ sack she got me to do it. 

Well... everything turned out fine, she looked scary af from the outside but was kind enough to leave her purse and phone in my car while she went to the dudes car so I didn't feel nervous!! Plus she got me some of the most fire dope I've ever had! Woohoooo!!! Got her number too soo yeehaww.

Hahah side note, when her dealer came, black guy, I'm scared of black people...but thats not the point I like was staring at his car just out of it and he was like, while she was in there ""why the fuck is he staring at me, do you know him and she was like yeah yeah i know him he's cool"" :D. 

So my advice for cold copping is, ask the homeless who are working the street! Not the ones passed out, and try to ask a women generally less dangerous then men. Also never stare at their dealer!! ",1469583009.0

I'm a high functioning addict, I have a great job and I don't struggle for money because of my addiction, but it gets me so down sometimes knowing that it might all just be fake happiness anytime I am happy. I go several months at a time ""clean"" (on suboxone) and I'm capable of resisting the urge to use when I'm on suboxone, I know I am, but at some point I always end up feeling like there's no point to even being clean because my life just feels like a boring shell when I can't get high, even when I am not experiencing withdrawals. I just don't care about being clean. The only reason I do it is to save money (and suboxone is really fucking expensive too so even that is dubious). I don't even usually get blasted high when I do use, I just use enough to feel normal. I don't feel normal when I'm not using opiates. I just feel like I'm going through the motions. Why am I like this?

The first time I ever used an opiate I knew something in my brain had clicked and I wouldn't be forgetting about it anytime soon, if ever. I've been using intermittently ever since. It's like my brain chemistry is just wired for this shit and it fills some kind of void in my soul while simultaneously opening up an even bigger chasm between me and normal people. The only thing I want out of life is to be able to be happy - if opiates provide that however fleetingly, what's the point of even trying to stay clean?

Oh yeah, the tolerance and withdrawal cycle. I know what I wrote above sounds ridiculously optimistic about the effects of abusing opiates. And next time I'm in withdrawal I'll ""remember"" why it is that I shouldn't do this shit, but I always go right back eventually, sometimes it takes a few weeks,  sometimes a few months, but it's always in the back of my head. I've never had a real intention of staying clean. It's just this dumb ass cycle I continue to put myself through year after fucking year. 

I haven't lost anything really serious in my life to this addiction yet besides my self respect but I'm not naive enough to think that it won't ever happen. I know this shit goes nowhere good, I just don't care. And I have no idea what the right thing to do is. 

If you've read this far I appreciate it, I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest. I don't have anyone in my life who knows about my use besides a couple friends who also use and a few others who try to be supportive but who I can't possibly be truly candid with about this shit. As far as they know I'm trying to get clean. I'm not willing to put my problems on other people and non-addicts don't get it anyways. 

If anyone ever wants to chat about anything, not just drugs, hit me up. I've been lurking here for a long time and I used to have an account but I lost the password. I'm just so tired of being me. I'd like to hear about what it's like to be other people for a change.",1469581466.0

I know about stashing it in rice, keeping it in a cool place, all that good stuff. Those are all the things I did the last time this happened to try and save what I had.

What are some of the craziest gambling stories you guys have? It doesn't necessarily have to be about you.





I went to Laughlin a while ago. We were heading to the club when  I spied a craps table - that looked to be heating up. I told my friends I am going to check it out, and I'll meet em up at the club later. I never made it to the club - I was playing craps till 4 in the morning. Ended up walking away with over $1500 (bought in with $60), helped couple next to me come up fat too. Pretty much why I love Craps so much. The whole table was having fun, and winning a bunch of money. 



Was in Vegas with my friend and her mom. I had taken them to Circus Circus to drink (before you talk shit - hand poured Patron Cadillac Margaritas made right(Cointreu and Gran Marnier) for 5 bucks. Somehow, we made it over to the Riverside. They had a craps table right as you came in - bare. So I wanted to play so I bought in ~50. My friend and her mom go off to play some slots. They come back after losing and want to leave. I tell them, I have been shooting the WHOLE time you were gone and I haven't crapped out once. You guys HAVE to play. They reluctantly  put like 20 each down. To make a long story short, I shot for almost 2 hours STRAIGHT. By that time a Indian couple had joined us. Finally, I crapped out but everyone passed and I started shooting again. I shot for another 1 1/2 hours - straight. A guy come up, and started betting his whole stack on every point in the beginning.  I walked away with close to $1000, my friend and her mom with $500 (combined), the Indian couple with $500 and the single guy walked away with over $4500 (He even threw me a $100 chip for ""saving his trip"") !!! If I wasn't so drunk I would have bet my odds much higher - probably would have walked away with 5k :l







Laughlin sent me offers for free room and free promo chips, so I went recently.  Took $100 and my promo chips to the craps table and walked away with almost $500. Made my weekend. However, some fucking guy put a $25 chip on boxcars, and apparently another $25 chip on the hop 12 bet (I dunno why - same bet I thought), but he FUCKING HIT for over $1500!! I don't think I have EVER seen anyone bet more than $5 on those inside bets. 






At a small Indian Casino in Bishop I lost $50 on Blackjack in 2 minutes, got a players card with $5 free slot play. Ended up winning $350 on my last spin.








Oh ya, I had a buddy hit a bad beat Progressive jackpot and walk away with 60k. He had 4 jacks cracked by 4 kings. He said he went from being the maddest he has ever been to the happiest in 2 seconds. 









I heard this one from a dealer, when I was playing poker at 3AM.  So I asked the dealer what was the craziest ""bad beat"" he had ever seen. He said years ago, he had just started dealing and there was a sweet old lady and this young hot shot at a  table.  He was starting to be very disrespectful towards her. Couple hands later, it was heads up between them with the board AK-?-KA. The pot was around $400, and the hot shot goes all in for like $150. Old lady looks at her cards, then looks straight into the hot shots eyes and says ""I want you to know, that you have been one of the most disrespectful and rude players I have played with in over 60 years that I have played poker.... Well let me tell you something - I can read you like a book. You have pocket kings. I can tell that you need money much more than I do, and I really hope that this teaches you some respect"" - then she shows and MUCKS pocket Aces!!!  Hot shot just sat there... and flipped over pocket kings. He won the pot, but if the lady would have called he would have won over 40k from the bad beat jackpot.

It's been many years of being a a opiate user I started when I was 16 years of age. I'm 23 now and a few months ago due to a user here on this Reddit I went in and got treatment I won't say who it is. I DID not go to rehab I simply found a female doctor in the area who's main practice is addiction medicine. It has saved me from the daily grip of Oxycodone and the big H powder. It was a while ago I went to see this doctor I was so nervous and dope sick and was ashamed of asking for help. I went in.....it was a small 1,100 square foot office with a booking manager for appointments, and herself the doctor including a cute lap dog that was a therapy dog. I spilt everything I had done the wild parties the benzo use the drinking when not using family history etc. She sat there and asked how was I alive. Now take it that I'm a suburban white middle class boy...I told her I don't know. At one point I was taking 25+ etiz that were 0.7mg Id black out on the couch for 3+ days with pills melting in my mouth hoping not to die and just to feel blank and in space. It was hard the first few meetings then came the day I got Suboxone and a few other scripts for depression (trazadone) and cramps, ect. It was as she was god and saved me! I'm on 16mg a day I vist here once every two weeks. Each time I vist we talk about what's going on, what I did that week and she shares what she did that week also...she puts on light classic rock on while we meet and chat. Overall the experience with my new doctor has been amazing I feel healthy I go to the gym now I have a new job and passion to live for and its also becuase of you guys true real people who share here I know everyone here is not about healing here. I want to thank this sub reddit :) I'm doing good and I check in once in awhile and see all the photos I can admit I miss the lifestyles crushing up some A-214's and 215s or some of that east coast fire shit or maybe some yellow school bus 10-325's or some old school purdue circa 2002 OP 20's or some orange pandas, or just a few xanax the cool thing is I'm legal and I get a small buzz and I might have one Heineken a week. I found a new skill self control I can admit I was always love opiates, also I can tell you that the when I'm done with treatment I will relapse (I hope not!) And think of all of you guys who are struggling or sick or not sick and have the BOTP dope (Best on the planet) I will come back with a new story when I do if I do. I know I can come here for advice and that's what matters the most.

She finds me passed out on my bed with puke all over my shirt.. She calls 911, they narcanned me put me in an ambulance and sent off to the ER.

Mas y'all may have read in my other post yesterday, I was stressing because I didn't think the two pink 10s I did yesterday would show up in my UA tomorrow at the clinic (which I need to happen, I have to piss dirty for some sort of narcotic)..

Well, I lucked out & was able to cop a 50 bag, then another 20 shortly there after, on top of 4 footballs; inb4 "" mixing that shit is hella bad"".

I'm about to say fuck it, & get on the highest methadone does possible within the 30 days of me being there, even though I KNOW that that is a SHIT idea, & I'd probably be worse off than before..

Has anyone started off with methadone for a few weeks, then switched over to subutex / suboxone? Or, should I be a good boy, get my 8mg of tex daily, & ween off the last remaining week or so?

This whole clinic thing is new to me, & I swore driving past it everyday the last few years, that I'd NEVER 'stoop that low' (no offense) because, this is my only option at this point.

I may still be extremely naive about what happens down the road which is why I ask.

Granted the assumption that sources of potent seeds never run dry, I feel like this is sustainable forever and I never need to go through withdrawal again so long as I plan my orders right and keep a big stockpile just in case.

I use about 150g per day of a pretty potent brand. This is just enough to give me a good buzz without impairing me or causing me to nod. It makes me more outgoing, more sociable, more motivated to get stuff done, more stable in terms of mood, and a generally more well rounded person with little repercussion.

Opiates are very physically benign so long as I take measures to not overdose. All of the other classical problems that come with opiate use are inherently not present in poppy tea. I don't need to worry about the law. I don't need to worry about mystery cuts or fentanyl as in heroin. I don't need to worry about collapsed veins, abscesses or track marks as in IV'd opiates. It won't bankrupt me as in pills; at 150g per dose, I'm only spending $1.25 per day on my habit.

And to top it all off, it's extremely easy to hide my use from others. All I need to do is have what's tantamount to a cup of tea in the morning and everyone is none the wiser since it has such a long duration.

The way I see it, this is no different than a caffeine habit that I can't stop. Yeah, there's the downside that I need to have it everyday, but for all of the benefits it brings me, that's not more than a slight inconvenience.

But then I read through some PST forums and threads, and I see many users who've much more experience than me crucifying the stuff on a daily basis as a life destroying, oppressive burden. This really worries me, is there anything I'm missing?

I text her...no response...text again...
Nothing

I finally ring her number and i get the dreaded ""this caller cannot accept calls at this time"" because theyre out of minutes...

Goddamnit...i need something now, god knows I cant wait on her...it could be tonight before I hear from her...

So I call my backup..this guy has shitty dope, doesnt give anything extra, and charges me $20 to deliver...
And he takes forever...oh well...

So now instead of getting a gram, Im gonna get .6...of shittier dope....fuck it...im too sick...cant wait.

I get a call from backup telling me hes heading my way...itll take him like 30...ok fine...thought you were already on your way...but whatever...beggars cant be choosers...

Wtf?!? He's a busy ass guy, why would he wait 2+ hours, not knowing when I was gonna be ready, just for a small ass order...

I just told him my mom took me to her house so I could help her do chores, and that I wont be back for a few hours...

That is, unless you're forced to because of a script refill or a reason that budgets your money or usage for you..

So, my plan is, instead of doing every last speck of dust in every bag, I'm going to take a tiny crumb from each and put it aside.
Call it emergencies or perhaps a monthly blow out.  


I'm already laughing at myself because I have no idea if I'll have the willpower to hold dope (even an amount that I know won't do shit) and not do it, My thinking is; I've been hustling and working enough not to be real sick for a long time , I've been sick maybe three times this year where I was either broke or nobody was answering their phone. It's never been longer than 36 hours. 
  


But now I've got a decent 3 hook ups that also do 10 bags which means that so long as I can hustle up £10, I'm okay - not high, but okay. 

  
Wouldn't it be nice to get an extra big shot at the end of the week or month, depending on how long I can hold out! I've got a little plastic egg (you guys know kinder eggs across the pond?). It closes air tight and its perfect for scraping a smidge of powder into for long term storage.,

Boom, so, as of today (just now in fact) I've started shaving off a small amount - not enough to make any difference to the effect, but enough to notice a collection building after a few pickups.

What do you guys think? Has the thought if saving dope never crossed your minds? I know for a fact that no matter how hard I try, having any left by morning is a practical impossibility! The difference here is that I know it won't do anything because its too small - so once I get that mentality locked in, I'll be able to continue saving it.

  
Obviously it goes without saying that if this were crack, I couldn't save any for any more than 4 minutes! Crack is the pringles of drugs. Once you pop, you can't stop. Watching people on their hands and knees surfing across the carpet smoking every speck of white coloured debris they come across is truly pathetic. Damn, I've seen people flip in moments. Normal person, to weirdo bizzare cracko vacuum, picking through folds in bed sheets, jacket pockets become infinitely deep and require a team to dive in and search. Yuck.

Excuse my ignorance if this is violating any of the rules. I ran into 6 20mg oxycodone hcl (371 white pill) from a buddy that had a pretty intense back surgery. He had 6 left for his script and decided to gift them to me. Well, not being so interested in opiates (a long line of heroin addicts in my family) I contacted my local drug dealer to see if perhaps I could trade it for some cannabis, as that is D.O.C behind perhaps LSD. I read that these suckers can go for $1 per/mg, and I had 120mgs total. My intentions were to cut him a deal and trade those 6 for an eighth of marijuana, which he typically sells for $30. This is where things get shady, I asked him if he's had experience selling oxy and if he knows what they'd be worth. He says he will call me back. Fair enough. Calls back quite giddy, saying they go for $1 per 10mg and that he'd give me $2 per pill. Now, I don't know if my information was outdated or if the oxy scene has seen a decline in prices, but everything in my body was telling me that my trusted dealer was trying to bend me over and fuck me. I told him I'd just hold onto them in that case, and I could hear disappointment in his tone for the rest of the call. Now my question is, was that a fair price?

I have been using opiates for over 10 years now.  At the very beginning I got addicted to heroin and I was using daily for the next 5 years. Afterwards I got off it and didn't do any for next 7 years (i have been doing other drugs - everything except opiates).

By beginning of last year I slowly started using heroin again sporadically for a few months. That of course turned into a full on addiction which thankfully didn't last long- I was sober and out of withdrawals completely in September

After that i haven't touched any opiates (except kratom) until January this year and then I started again slowly.  That resulted again with full on addiction in march.

Until few months ago I was always doing all fentanyl analogues by the same RoA (nasally). It worked great, no problems whatsoever but then everything changed!

The most recent batch came in and a very sticky, oily substance, which consumed the crystalised Fu-F in the bag.

The main standout point in this Fu-F are large cuboid/reddish crystals which are covered in a slight oil.

So; obviously it was impure and/or unfinished. Nevertheless I did manage to get a (mild) high from this and it served as simple maintenance drug. The taste was also very different from Fu-F, it's grim.

Other batches from the same company have been very successful, for instance the previous batch lasted a very long time indeed! Not to mention other suppliers' stock.


> **So, now onto the big question..*(drumroll)*...""Has anyone had or noticed this form of fent. crystals (with special regard to Fu-F)?""**

These incidents are likely to turn up sooner rather than later as this batch is fairly new and has been released recently. So good luck everyone.

I really wish I stuck to my plan  and took a quarter of the instant release. 

I am ashamed to admit it but I put in four days of tapering at a very low taper.m this morning I woke up with tremendous  withdrawls    Which is why I  justified to myself that  I  absolutely needed it.  I didn't even try to use ,  I panicked and I took 10 mg. My normal usage for the extreme taper has been .2.5 mg of Opana IR on in the morning to ward off withdrawals.  My prescription is for 10 mg of Opana ER and IR x3. For the first four day  days I was super lucky and had very minimal withdrawals. But now I am almost out of my Clonopin to help me get through the first week or so, so I suppose I need to start again next week.

 Is it possible I only set myself back a little bit? Or is this the type of deal where if you take your normal about your pretty well back to your old self? I'm not talking about controlling the addiction/urge, I'm talking about whether or not my body is already  acclimated to the pain medicine  and if I am back at the beginning when it comes to physical dependence. 


 My question is this. And am I back at square one? Or did I set myself back like a day or so and should continue? If I set my self to at the beginning, and going to retry again next month and give the Clonopin a break for a while to increase its potency. 

Tl;dr

 Instead of taking a tiny amount of my painkiller, like I have been for the past four days, I took a whole 10 mg instant release. Am I back at square one? They're so strong that they're making me sick at the moment. Maybe I can continue the taper and see how it goes?",1469802987.0

I urgently need your help as I scored some nice dope which I want to iv. over the weekend and I'm, although being an occassional iv user, suddenly not able to inject properly anymore.

Excuse my long text, for tl;dr you could just read the first and fifth paragraph or so. If you want I can also upload pictures of my arms :D 

I'm only occassional shooting up, sometimes 3 times a week, sometimes 2 times in a month. My veins are still in a pretty good shape, the overall amount of (successfull) injections I did is maybe about +- 40 times. I have quite shaky hands due to an accident which is why I sometimes need 2-3 tries until I'm successfully in a vein, however I got used to it and most of the times it works flawlessly.

Now my problem which really messes up my weekend and my mood whereas I'm still at work and the prospect that I can't enjoy my dope as planned really annoys me.. it almost makes me sad :D

Sure I'm still a noob in iv use but I'm totally aware about proper injection techniques. For the last 3 days I poked myself countless times and had only 3 successfull shots. I prepare my shot as usual, put the syringe in position, poke through my skin and already pull the plunger back to notice as soon as it registers. This normally worked pretty well, plenty dark red blood flowed into the syringe, I push the plunger down, re-register and inject the rest of it.

However since a few days I often manage to register as usual but as soon as I begin injecting, it feels like I'm missing. So I try to register again and.. nothing, only a vacuum. This freaks me out as it happens every damn time and after the first unsuccessfull try it's very unlikely for me to still manage to inject properly so in the end I have to plug it.. :D

I'm only able to hit the following veins or they are the only ones I can see and / or feel:

In my crook (obv.), but I have to give it rest as I was overusing my crook in the beginning when I was not able to hit other veins

The one that runs almost in the middle of my forearm (I had seldom success injecting here, I almost never hit the vein as it's really tiny)
The one on the wrist that starts at the back of my thumb and runs along the side of the wrist

This morning I tried the one on the back of my hand for the first time with no success. It is very prominent in contrast to my other veins but still, the best I was able to manage was like I've written before: I registered but it seems like I slipped out of the vein after that.

Now these spots urgently need rest, my right arm is almost virginal but I still had a problem when I tried the one on my right wrist this morning, although I'm right handed and it becomes very prominent when using a tourniqet. The other veins in my right arm especially the ones in the crook are not noticeable with the fingers even with a tight tourniquet. There is one which doesn't run exactly along the crook but it feels like something is pounding in there (arthery).

I have a tourniquet which I can't use without hands so I often fasten it to make out where my veins are and then loosen it a bit and inject or put it away completely. In the beginning I was able to inject without a tourniquet anyways. However I'm beginning to think about that maybe I really NEED a tight tourniquet in order to solve my problem. I already tried shoelaces and wanted to open them with my mouth however I seem like I can't wrap it around my arm tightly enough to make the veins come out and easier hittable. 

What also bothers me is that I used the one on my wrist for like 7 or 8 times the last time (2 weeks ago) and although becoming very good visible, I seem like I cannot even register there anymore.

I also tried different angles, maybe I'm using the wrong angle? I have relatively skinny arms and the veins seem to run close to the surfe so I go in in a shallow angle. However I noticed if I go in at 30-40° and put the syringe in a more shallow position right after registering it sometimes worked better. But in the end it's very mysterious as my veins a almost brand new. And even though I'm right handed my veins on the right arm are barely visible / noticable with the fingers what seems strange to me.

Excuse me for the long text but maybe there are some completely wrong assumptions by me which I totally overlooked?

I already googled like crazy and I know almost every well known guide about injection, but I still appreciate any help that could 'save' my weekend. I'm so tired from work this week and planned on nothing than shooting up and now I'm not able to do it anymore ;( Also I don't want to go on wasting my dope by having to put it up my ass :D

After you've been dry for however long and you finally get your fix... What's your ritual like? What do you spend the first few hours of relief doing?

Personally, when I'm out I tend to let things around me go straight to hell. I'll stop showering and just take washbasin baths for a few days, I won't pick up my trash and let my garbage cans overflow, and let my dirty dishes pile up... It's not completely disgusting - I never let it get *that* bad - but it gets bad enough that I wouldn't want strangers to see it or me.

So after I push my shot I do my normal routine - smoke a cigarette, put my works away, check messages here, on Facebook, and my e-mail, that kind of thing - and then I spend an hour or so cleaning my house up. Not a deep-cleaning or anything *(I wouldn't advise eating off my floors for example)*, but I try to make things at least a little better than they were when I ran out all those days *(those oh so fucking LONG days)*ago. 

Then, after my place is clean I like to go take an absurdly long shower, scrubbing my whole body down, washing and conditioning my hair (even doing the ""repeat"" part of ""rinse, wash, repeat"") and beard, shaving/trimming my facial hair, brushing and flossing, then trimming all my nails. Hell, I'll even do a bit of manscaping if I think there's a chance of some lucky lady and me engaging in the kind of activity where it would be appreciated. *(You know - like going to church or engaging in a prayer circle.)* 

I seriously go all out when it comes to my Post-Dry First-Shot Soapy-Soap Clean Time *(or PDFSSSC for short)*. I'm talking multiple soaps, beard oil, different lotions for different body parts. Shit - I even use two different loofahs for God's sake!

She asks me to come over and do coke all night with her. Coke isn't really my thing, but she was a huge addict, so we did a lot and had a lot of fun (plus I got to do booty bumps!). I'd bring bud and some booze (she was a couple months shy of 21), just to avoid looking like a mooch. Still, she offered smokes all night, coke all night, benzos (which made me wait till the next morning to be able to fuck .. I now avoid benzos *and* coke I'd I have any hopes of banging that night) whatever alcohol I wanted, and bud all night. We banged and watched a movie, but talked non-stop for about 8 hours. I'd never met a girl like this and although she was gonna bang me before she even met me, I knew she had to be mine

Over the next few weeks, we'd do this same thing once a week until she stopped texting back (I figured she was back with her boyfriend).

Between then and now, we hung a negligible more times, just havin drinks and smokin. From this point, however, she stopped letting me hook up with her for the most part (sex maybe once or twice, and usually some kisses and some cuddles).

Just recently, I hit her up asking for coke (I didn't even want any, I just wanted to hang out) and she ended up staying over last night. We'd talked about dating before, but this was the first time we seriously considered it, and I'm taking her out dancing.

My question for **/r/opiates** is whether an opiate addict could safely date a coke head? She's tried dope a few times, but it's not her thing. I swear, I think about this girl night and day. While I used to think it was prob just the drugs that made us get along, last night's relative sobriety proved that I could have just as much fun with this girl without drugs as with them. She's the only person I've ever been 100% honest with and tbh could be the girl of my dreams, if only I wasn't scared that her coke use may somehow drag me down (I want to recover right away .. Maybe outpatient, since I'm hopefully going back to school in a month).

Has anyone ever had a similar situation? I can't stop thinking about this girl and tbh, would consider rocking up that finger (so to speak) if I wasn't so nervous that it could end my life.

**TL;DR:** I'm trying to recover, but one of my best friends (hopefully girlfriend) is a total coke head. Until she recently lost her job for political reasons, she was making like $50K a year at only 20 years old. Does anyone have experience with a similar situation or think that a relationship could flourish between two addicts who each have a different D.O.C.?",1469732501.0

We got close and I'd stay at his place all the time so I got to know his family. His sister was an addict. She would get so messed up she'd be looking for her 2 year old behind the stove. She'd sell her body for drugs. She'd do anything for drugs. 

She decided she finally wanted to get well and went to rehab. She was doing well, she only had to stay for 30 days. On day 27 she started complaining of chest pain. They thought she was lying to get pain meds and ignored it. This went on until day 29 when they found her unresponsive in her bed. Instead of calling an ambulance and taking her to the closest hospital, they load her into an employees car and start to drive her to a big hospital in the city that was an hour away. Ten minutes into the drive they stop and finally call an ambulance because she stopped breathing. She never woke up. They took her to the hospital and hooked her up on all the machines that do everything your body is supposed to. They evaluated and decided that she couldn't donate any organs based on her drug use. She died of pneumonia.

She was covered in bruises and track marks when she entered rehab. She let men abuse her for drugs. She finally got tired of it and died one day short of her new life. 

I was with them when they had to decide to pull the plug. I watched as the machine slowly stopped breathing for her. Her face drained of color, and she was gone.

I'm 27 now. I've been broken up with him for over 4 years now but I still think about Lindsey all the time. 

She was so sweet and nice when she wasn't fucked up. She loved her daughter. She just wanted to get well, but she was the girl who cried wolf.

   Used to be massive u4 addict for around 6 months or so. Quit that beginning of may I believe. Since then and now I've chipped maybe pst 3-4 times, heroin about the same amount of times.


   Recently I went on a 5 day heroin binge and on Tues morning I smoked a tiny little hoot in the morning. It's now Friday night (10:52PM pacific as I write this). During the 5 day binge I think I smoked 3 pts a day except for 1 day when it was only a pt.


   Anyways I obviously went through withdrawals, nothing nearly as bad as my cold turkeyd 2 gram a day u4 habit, but twas good old withdrawals none the less.


   Anyways, today was definately an improvement compared to the last 2 days , the tail end of wd. Still having trouble sleeping and restlessness. So my buddy knows an old guy that has no problem giving him ativan so he grabs me like 14 .5mg ativan for free. Sweet! I take 2 and then 1 more later and 1 more later, defs gonna sleep good.


   Anyways, buddy wants me to help him grab a point of h. Obviously a bad idea considerin I'm on the tail end of my wd, but he really did me a solid with those ativan.


   Anyways we grab the point and the usual stuff is this rock white stuff. Not super experienced with H (lots of U4 experience tho lol) but this stuff is good potent stuff from the small amount of h Ive done, gives me an INSANE histamine reaction. Never gotten anything that bad. I need to take benedryl and it helps a little but still insane histamine reaction, tho one of my other buddy doesn't get it. Anyways that beyond the point.


   This time it's this powdery brown colored stuff. Being the retarded junky I am, I ask for a small key bump of the stuff. Considering I'm stI'll in minor withdrawals I'm expecting something quite noticable. Don't notice much if anything,  so when we get back to our cars I smoke a bump on some foil. I do feel something now but not much. So I decide it's some weak shit, so fuck it ima grab a point to myself #justjunkiethings so I grab a point and I call my guy out on it and he's like yah wasn't able to get the normal stuff this time, this stuffs weaker. So not like he lied or anything.  I'd estimate it was a quarter as potent as the regular white stuff, my less experienced buddy said he felt it was half as strong. 


   Anyways I smoke that point, minus a few key bumps real quick. And yah I feel opiated, withdrawals gone. But considering how much ativan I did (I rarely use benzos) I wasn't that high , so basically I smoked a point of some lower quality H.


   So now my question is: how badly did I shoot myself in the foot? Is it likely that I'll be back to square one with withdrawals or was this like just a small step back in my detox?

Yeah, so who are they for? What are you going to use them for? You need a prescription for them, I can call your doctor if you'd like"" Basically fuck that guy. 

So, I'm going to try the other Walmart tomorrow and see if they have 10 packs. Where do you guys go in your area? I'm in a state under Indiana but above Tennessee, use your imagination.

At the moment, I tend to snort/smoke a half G a day (I try not to do too much because Money is an issue right now.) Not at all new, I've been prescribed opiates for 11 years. Out of curiosity, I'll be using the same dope I've been using, if I do about a half to a full point at a time, what would you cut that down to for a first dope shot? Half point? Quarter?

I need help.,"First off, please read this if you're willing to help out another addict in need. I could use the help and I need someone to listen.

Dear Opiates community,

I need your help... More importantly, I need someone to listen, and give advice because it's been a very long time since I've had that. So, my story starts at 19 when I tried heroin for the first time. I was a barback that worked 5-6 days of the week. I started to have bad back pains and ended up getting pills and eventually heroin from the su chef at work. I had a small addiction for about a year and left it behind... Sadly, it found me again, and that's where my story really starts.

A little more than three years ago I moved into a house where it was reintroduced to me. I started using occasionally and it eventually became an every day addiction. Over the past three years I've been on and shortly off again... But the past year has been the worst.

First it started the depression. I was working a good job, supporting my habit, and was able to pay for the other necessities in my life...but I wasn't happy. My friends left me behind when they found out about my addiction and I had very few people to talk to. Eventually I stopped hanging out with people and my life became what it now is, work/home/and nothing but me by myself. I work and when I'm done or have a day off, I stay at home watching videos/listening to podcasts/etc or I'll go for a walk.

Eventually I lost that job of three years. It was going nowhere and I had become a little disgruntled, and I was let off in January. That's when two months of struggling to keep up with my addiction with little to no money became my day to day struggle. It was some of the most miserable moments I had in my life...doing whatever I had to do to get the money, a lot of which I'm not proud of. Too many times I feel like I got by that day just by the grace of luck. Still, I couldn't quit, I was too miserable to be without it.

That's brings us to the last several months. I had finally started working again, but nothing really stabilized. My addiction really has taken over my entire life. I spend all my money on heroin, most of my time is spent thinking about how I'm going to space out my doses over the day. I don't have any friends to talk to except maybe a couple, but they've been distant. My living situation makes me feel worse. The guy I live with is a piece of shit who's only made my life worse. And my depression is at its worse, when my emotions manage to break through the barrier of heroin induced endorphins in my brain, I tend to just cry myself to sleep because I feel hopeless. I feel like I'm in the bottom of a hole I can't get out of, just staring up at the sky, yelling, hoping someone will hear me.

I need to do something. I know that I can't keep up with this. I know things aren't going to change. I talked to a manager at my job and told him that I might need to take a leave of absence and that I'd like to keep this job, and he was ok with it. The thing I've really been debating is the one thing I've avoided at all cost from happening during this addiction, which is telling my parents. As I've learned already, once you tell someone... You can't go back. But I need help, and there is no one else that can help me with that. I need to do something, but I'm scared and I just need someone to listen and give me advice.

So this is what I'm asking you Reddit. What should I do? How should I approach this? Can anyone make me not feel like such a piece of shit?",1469844637.0

I'm starting to freak out kinda. i have a couple other people i could call but they are *maybes* at best. and they're not dealers, they just middle and expect me to break them off when i don't have extra cash and all the dope i get i actually *need*. hell, I'm sick enough as it is and i usually don't give away anything, ever. so, since my guy isn't calling i decide its better to go out and try to score from my other sources than sit around waiting for a call that may not come at all. i got shit to do today. so as soon as i walk outside and start heading to the bus stop, wondering quietly to myself if maybe today a comet will fall from the sky and scorch this part of the earth, my phone vibrates. unknown number. fuck.yes. its my guy. he will be here in 15 minutes. crisis averted.

I made this account solely because my aunt is in dire straits and she is searching desperately for a solution to her insufferable pain. Communities like these often offer the best advice and I am relying on the combined expertise and knowledge here.

So my aunt, living in Colorado, who is now in her late sixties suffers from a number of severe and debilitating health problems which she has treated medically for the last 10 years with a doctor-prescribed opiate. Now, due to federal crackdowns on anything medical opiate, she's been cut off from what was successfully treating her ailments for 10 plus years, allowing her to live a very functional and happy life. Unfortunately, she's stated that with her present level of pain, she would be more inclined to kill herself than live with her level of suffering for much longer.

Basically, what she needs now is access to legal means for a prescription to medical opiates. She is willing to move overseas if that's what it takes to find her life-saving treatment. Any states/countries that have access to this type of treatment could mean an opportunity of adding maybe even another 10 happy and productive years to my aunt's life.

So please, if you are able to lend any knowledge or advice on her situation or how she could improve it, please, please leave me a comment or PM on what I/she/we can do to help. Thank you!",1469834702.0

My fiancée caught me, shit hit the fan, so I'm trying to quit. I've been to a few NA meetings, there kinda weird. A little cult like at times but the stories are good. Saw an addiction councilor and he asked a fuck ton of questions but I was honest and he said they would find a treatment program. They do mostly court mandated treatments so he was saying that all the ones he knows about are 100% drug free programs, like no weed/alcohol. Im not really a drinker but smoke, especially now that I've stopped using dope and so far at least when I'm high (on weed) it makes the time more enjoyable and helps me stop thinking about scoring/using. Now I know that may change but for now it's working. And I like to drink occasionally, going out with friends and such. Again I don't see that being a problem now but things could change. 

So to get to my question, do you think the councilor would just not let me do the program if I said I was gonna smoke and occasionally drink? I'm not doing it for court or anything so if I failed a drug test for those things idk what he would do? Like I doubt he would kick me out, that would seem weird but idk, I have never done this before. If anyone has experience please share.

Nevertheless it doesn't make the prospect of WDing any less scary. 

Background: been in PM for 8 years.  Used to take 6 5MG Vicodin per day (30mg) and 2 5mg Opana ER for yearsssssss.  Got a new doctor two years ago and he decided that I needed to be tapered off.  Started with the Opana and now I'm supposed to be down to 1 Vicodin per day.  Been getting a little help on the side so I'm really still at 4-5 per day (20-25mg)

At the end of April I tried to jump off cold turkey and went through hell for a week.  The lack of sleep eventually sent me back to the pills.  I'm kind of mad at myself that I didn't stick with it then, but I digress. 

So here's what I've got for my WD this time!

Chlonidine (1mg, 14 pills)
Xanax (.05mg, 30 pills)
Immodium 
Gaba (don't know dosage and how many, used to be prescribed so I have a ton left)

My main questions are:

1).  Do you think the WD won't be as bad considered I stopped and have only been using agajn for 3-4 months?

2).  Do you think my WD gear will be helpful?  I plan on using the Xanax (.05mg) ONLY at night to help me sleep.

4vgfn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4vgfn5/been_clean_a_while_now/,9,https://redd.it/4vgfn5,BB-8_,been clean a while now.,"Hey guys,
It's 2:16am, so I'm feeling all existential and shit lol.

I got home from rehab about July of 2015. Relapsed on and off between then and December, and got my act together by the new year. I haven't used since. I go to the methadone clinic near where I live, but I've gotten to a pretty damn low dose (36mg/day), and I've worked up to 6 take-homes/week. So I only have to actually go to the clinic once a week, for my counselling session.

I had a couple different usernames active in this sub... I posted a decent amount, commented a lot, interacted with a lot of you in general. It's a strange little community we have here but at times you guys were literally all I had. Like I remember being up around this time of night all time time, between the wee hours of 2:00am-5:00am, usually either in withdrawals or chain-shooting every hour or so, which was always a horrible waste of H in a desperate attempt to chase that rush... lol. During those middle-of-the-night hours I was almost always on this sub, just reading past posts, chatting with the other people who were up, etc. It's weird but I miss it. 

This last week I've been catching up on Season 4 of ""Orange is the New Black"" and it's triggering me like crazy. But I can't help but keep watching cuz it's so fucking good and I want to see what happens next LOL. I relate so hard with Nicki. When she (SPOILERS IF YOU AREN'T CAUGHT UP ON OITNB GO AWAY NOW!!!) relapses after finding Sophia's SHU cell covered in blood... I was literally sobbing, pile of tissues in my lap, crying ""NO NICKI DON'T DO IT, DON'T DO IT, YOU HAVE 3 YEARS NICKI, DON'T DO IT NO NICKI NOOOOOOOOOOOO."" :( :( :( 

I'm feeling sort of scared. I'm scared because it's been a long time, months, since I've had those thoughts- ""maybe you can just use one more time, just for a little while, just a day or two and you'll be fine."" But, lately they're creeping back. I don't even know why. Things are actually going pretty well. I've been working super hard this last year or so, and I have a lot to show for it. So why am I even thinking these thoughts? What's wrong with me :(?

I'm a fairly experience pre-med student, attending medical school next year, and despite my knowledge of chemistry and physiology, I still barely trust myself with mixing benzos and opiates, however I have a very good understanding of the proper doses needed to be as safe as kissable.  I just want to stress again, DO NOT DO WHAT I'M DOING.   

Now that my harm reduction and background is done back to the question at hand, I use tagame (cimetidine) to potentiate xanax by inhibiting the CCYP450 group of, basically blockinf the breakdoqn of xanax within your body, causing it to last longer. This works with almost all oral opiates as well.

What I've never been able to figure out, is if there's a way to make IV beroin last longer.

That's my third post about my tiresome pills which I got for free when I bought my dope as usual. They are 80mg Oxycodone ER pills, brand is Actavis Reltebon.

Yesterday I took one 80mg pill and although my dope tolerance isn't that high, it felt like a waste.

Now I'm curious about if I could inject those pills? I've got wheel filters available and know what I have to do. However I'm not fully aware if there are ingredients which would make them impossible or even more dangerous to shoot up than injecting pills by itself.

Any advise is appreciated and I know, shooting up pills is bad however I never buy pills, that's the first time before my heroin habit begun so it will be a one time thing or something I'll do very seldom.

The leaflet with all the ingredients can be found here:

He hasn’t made the best choices before and I knew he was involved with a bad crowd. He’s been looking and acting very different and I knew it had to be drugs. He was slumping over a lot of the time and doing odd things such as dropping items he was holding for no reason. The best description I could give is he looked like the zombies in old zombie films. When he wasn’t looking like a zombie he would be rushing off somewhere and be very irritable. If anyone dared get in his way he lost his temper. 

I researched a lot of the symptoms I was noticing and that brought me here where I read a little more. I started looking out for other signs his pupils are very small when I think he’s taken something. I think he gets symptoms when he’s not high because he looks physically uncomfortable and very sweaty. I don’t know if he would be using needles because he wears button down shirts and long sleeves often but he also wears short sleeves some of the time.

I scared myself reading here because it could be heroin. I know it could be prescription medicine too but that leads to heroin does it? Is there a way to tell if he’s using heroin or the medication? Whats the best way to talk about it with him? I’m very worried for him he’s not himself and I don’t want him to die. Please tell me what he’s doing, and what I can expect, and what I should do.

The only reason i don't want to wait is that i have no more pins and i have a fairly high tolerance, so 10mg of methadone iv wouldn't do much for me without some help from good old Mr. Clonazepam. Thanks for the any input.

*Update:* I waited until the morning to take any. I was able to take about 2mg of klonopin potentiated by two 200mg tagament (cimetidine is cheaper but tagamet was all i had) taken 30~ minutes earlier. and then injected 10mgs (clear) methadone liquid between 30 minutes to an hour after taking the pins (when i started to feel them, to potentiate the small amount of methadone [for my tolerance.]. i dunno what type, but not the cherry type or anything like that. just clear, bitter, doesn't taste like any added sugar, liquid methadone. i wasn't feeling sick yet, but i iv'd the done anyway and i actually felt the rush. i feel okay now. a bit better than i did before. also have been smoking the marijuanas. so, experiment over and thanks for riding the train! peace.

**Warning:** Don't mix downers. Opiates, benzos, alcohol, etc.  Downers are dangerous alone but when  mixed together, whooo buddy. They can depress your breathing so much that you stop, aka an overdose. So, always get hizigh with a buddy and some Narcan, if possible. i know that's not usually feasible, so just don't mix these substances pls :(.

I'm in a maintenance program where I take 16mg of subs a day. Been in it for about 8 months this time. Decided that I could use a heroin holiday. Took my normal dose around 11am on day one. Used that same night around midnight with very little breakthrough. Day two I took 2mg of suboxone around 10am, and started smoking black about an hour or two later. Breakthrough was much better by this point, but still not great. By about midnight that night though, I could easily get high beyond the sub remaining in my system. Only had a g to smoke, so it was gone that night. Was an enjoyable break from my daily dose of subs. Day 3 I went back to my normal dose of 16mg around noont, with no petcipitated withdrawals.

I wasn't so confident I'd be able to use dope and get high with no physical consequences, but it seemed to work just fine! Guess it's true that if you keep some bupe in your system, petcipitated withdrawal is a non issue. Now let's just hope my piss test comes up clean.",1469918231.0

Unfortunately though my days of taking dope are numbered as I am looking to quit before my semester starts in Sep. anyways I come from a 6 month Roxxy binge, alas it was only at most 2 a day but still the withdrawals were brutal as fuck cutting it cold turkey(connect randomly cut me off) after about 18 days of being clean from the roxs my friend introduced me to dope. I got thru the physical pain but the PAWs was killing me so I decided to try it. I instantly fell in love and have been doing it for about a month now. A bundle would usually last me about 3-4 days. Anyways I bought a brick yesterday and made a pact that it was my last batch to my GF. I was hoping to spread this thru August seeing I can make one bun last me days. Would you guys say the Withdrawals would worst than my roxxy W/Ds? I also have 3 Suboxone 8mg strips i plan on tapering with after I'm done with the brick. Any other useful things I should grab to prepare? Anyways thanks guys. Wish you all the best. ",1469898229.0

4vct7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4vct7j/suffocating/,18,https://redd.it/4vct7j,Scratiii,suffocating.,"So I haven't used in like a week but i got some on Friday. Everything was normal more of less. After the first night of use, I wake up super short or breath. Almost having to force myself to breathe. Well after last night I almost can't breathe st all. I have to be sitting up just go breathe, I can't take deep breaths, and if I walk like 5 feet im completely out of breath. Has anyone experienced this?..

Update: passed out shortly after posting this from lack of sleep. My lungs don't seem to hurt that much anymore and I can breathe a little easier. I'm going to be taken to the hospital in a little while just waiting on my ride. Thank you all for your concern <3 and thank you for the advice ",1469896742.0
4vct4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4vct4w/iv_site_question/,6,https://redd.it/4vct4w,mynewopiateusername,IV site question,Hello bropiates I just had a quick question about IV. I am not a seasoned pro only been injecting a few months. I recently got 30 mg IR morphine and have been able to register/hit most of the time. I just moved to a new area and not able to get new rigs right away. But when I just poke in and miss and take it out a little white bump forms. It doesn't really hurt and nothing is injected. Does anyone know what's up with this? It also gets a bit of redness and that bump but normally goes away after like 30 mins- an hour. Anyone have insight on this? Thanks in advance for all your help hope everyone has some happy nods today :),1469896716.0

They have no idea and I don't know if I wanna jeopardize that. The thing is I'm really struggling with this shit. I had $6 for groceries all of last week. I got sour keys and a box of frozen waffles. Do you know what its like eating only waffles for a whole week? I'm sick of this shit. I haven't made any friends here because I look like a fucking junkie. 

You would think being so fed up I'd buckle down and stop like a normal functional human being. No because my autopilot is fully engaged to stick shit in your arm mode. I need someone to lock me in a room and tell me too damn bad. My parents wont take no for an answer I know them. I wanna tell them so bad I want them to help me. 

But I also don't wanna sabotage myself that way. I can never go back from that and I'm scared. I don't know what to do does telling your parents help if your too much of a pussy to quit on your own?
