Ive been suboxone for keeping me away, stopped 1,5 week ago, waited 4 days and then started with oxy, then morph. in all ways.. and no effect.

Can suboxone whichi is SUPER POTENT (i use 16g) 2 x, (but again, stopped and waited 4 days to try others.

I've found this long list of drugs that interact with these enzymes and thought it might be a useful resource here (also at bluelight and erowid but i dont feel like making an account, feel free to copy and paste this there if someone wants) so I'm making a but of a PSA for potentiator awareness and information. For those that dont know, potentiators are drugs that interact with other drugs to make the effects better in a variety of ways. Think of your brain as a burning house, opiates as firemen, and potentiators as their axe. Sure, theyll get to that fire and do what theyre trying to do, but if they have an axe itll be really easy and theyll have time to try out that new xbox for the station that was ""lost in the fire."" CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 are enzymes that have to do with how opiates and many other drugs are broken down in the body; inhibitors make them less effective, inducers make them more effective. Ill try to give a quick breakdown of what i know here, but dont take my word for it and do your own research.


https://liferaftgroup.org/long-list-of-inhibitors-and-inducers-of-cyp3a4-and-cyp2d6/


Inducing these enzymes will increase the elimination rate of most relevant drugs and each enzyme has their own set of metabolizations with certain drugs. For example, CYP2D6 metabolizes tramadol into O-desmethyltramadol, a much for potent opiod so youd want to use an inducer with tramadol. CYP3A4 metabolizes morphine into inactive products so you'd want to inhibit it if taking morphine. There are many many things these enzymes can do and it varies drug to drug, so make sure you do your own research. Generally, inhibiting these will make opiates last longer and CYP2D6 is more often considered when potentiating. There is certainly much much more to know about this topic so heres a thread with lots of discussion and explanation.


http://www.bluelight.org/vb/archive/index.php/t-370193.html


As a little aside, I very much enjoy learning about and applying knowledge of drugs. It'd be really cool if people more knowledgeable than me could point me to a specific place, method, or direction that can help me learn more.



Potentiators CAN be dangerous in the sense that if done right, you're essentially taking more of the drug than normal with a given dose, so watch out folks. If I got anything wrong here please correct me. I certainly do not do drugs I just really fucking love drugs because of the science. And stuff.",1512744591.0

I also took a really low dose (0.05mg) of flunitrazolam (benzo RC) when I woke up, but that's like 8 hours ago. It's duration is only 5 hours but it's half life could be longer? I can't really find reliable info on that, should I wait longer? 12 hours before taking that dose I took more of flunitrazolam, but that should be long gone out of my system too right?

rules:  
1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.  

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.  

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

Stopped by a shop for some cash, I tho thw asshole low balled me so I went to another shop with a smarter owner/manager, arrived at about 1:45 after stopping to toss the $5 minimum needed in my gas tank, the cars great on gas 26mpg to 45mpg usually closer to mid 30's where I live. After getting 35$ more than original guy I hit up my guy for a meet. 


  I texted first then called 3 minutes later and was hoping to be quick as I was in the area, hence the impatience. He calls me back right as I hang up after hearing his VM. He asks where I'm at I tell him then ask if he's got both and he says yea, yea (awesome only one stop and waiting to meet on one dude before I can retreat home to get my groove on) and well dude told me to meet him 3 different places before deciding McDonalds, great its 3 minutes behind me. Pull up texting him let him know I'm there and light up a smoke and what do you know he shows up right when I get halfway done which when I first started going through him was common, but now it was a nice chance of pace.


  I didn't take any pictures, but he hooked it up for just a little over $100 I got; 16 bags of boy and I'd say close to a gram of soft girl (yes I know its cut but for the price I'm good w/ that). Got home by 2:55 and pushed off shortly after. Been partying pretty good solo for 9 hours. Now I am drinking some rum and coke to chase down my 2mg of klonopin That I crushed and parachuted to try and enhance it a bit. I know alcohol, and klonopin, and dope is generally a recipe for respiratory depression, but I have confidence in my use and the such. Plus I would like to sleep tonight and save my last bit of coke n' dope for a nice morning shot. Being as I have 1 more shot of dope and like 1-2 of coke debating on coke still.



  Well that's my story's pretty much the state of my life, I do this once or twice or thrice a month the other days I set due and get by with suboxone. Any questions or hate or comments or love always appreciated. I do not love this cycle, but I love the time when I'm at today.

A few minutes later, they were there to arrest us. Dick cop told me they were charging me/us with possession. I was confused though, because the dope was all gone. All that was left were empty bags & a rig. So they took me in and left him in the hospital for a few hours, then came and got him too. As I layed there on my cement bed, in my fucking freezing cold cell, I finally asked them wtf was going on. Like what am I even being charged with? He said that Im being held on probable cause for 48 hrs and if the DTs can't put a case together, I'm free to go. So the DTs came in & started asking me where I got the dope from and all that good stuff, so honestly I told them.

They had the same convo with my bf but i guess they told him that if he doesn't txt them with dmans phone number, ""the deal is off"". But what deal? We were released with no charges. We didn't get a court date. Are the DTs gonna come find him and make him cooperate with them to get the dman? Im confused because don't they use people with charges to help them, and then offer those people immunity from their charges? Can they arrest him for not helping out? And aren't there Good Samaritan Laws that protect us? i just read that there were. Also, the DTs said that there was a rig and some residue left in the bags so thats how they got us for posession. But I dont think we got charged because they released us. Is he obligated to work as an informant? Will they come get him if he doesn't? Is there a law protecting us? Can someone help please.

I got into heroin about this time last year. Quickly became less and less interested in other drugs, even other things. Dope and depression became the ONLY things in my life and I'm making a serious effort to improve myself. I've been dependent on various substances from age 15 onward, currently 19 and trying to dig myself out this hole while im still young and have time to make something of myself. I'm finding the hardest part of getting clean isn't staying clean itself, however trying to find other things to fill the shoes left by heroin. I almost never leave the house unless im going straight to my job or home, and am missing the whole lifestyle surrounded by my addiction. It was fast paced, unpredictable. Also certainly dangerous and stupid, but theres nothing quite like it.

I realize none of this is groundbreaking and things like this get posted all the time. I just felt like making a short post that I can go back to in the future and see how I was feeling at this pivotal moment in my future.  Hope someone read it, thanks!

I don‚Äôt see anybody talking about it on this sub,"Agmatine really helps. If you‚Äôre already shooting up several bags of H a day don‚Äôt worry about it. If you can afford it at that level at least, but you can take agmatine. I‚Äôll explain why. 

If you are taking milder Opiates, agmatine will help a lot with potentiation. Your opiate will feel quite a measurable bit stronger if you take agmatine before it. I weigh about 240 and take 2,000 mg agmatine with my opiate medicine, so adjust your agmatine dosage based on that. I could probably take 2,500 of ag, but 2,000 seems to work the best. As well as potentiating the opiate at dose, it also lowers your tolerance slowly. So taking agmatine daily will lower the opiate you need, to feel high or keep you from getting sick at least. This is where you heavy IV users will get some benefit. After a couple weeks you can go from 6 bags a day to 4 or less. It doesn‚Äôt affect the feeling of any opiate other than a mild boost to the sedation and euphoria, so it‚Äôs only a bonus.

Tl;dr taking agmatine will make your opiate stronger and lower your tolerance over time. ",1512700643.0

Since getting clean our lives have gotten exponentially better. New apartment, new jobs, doing well. But she is struggling with depression and has been dead set on picking up this weekend. I thought it would pass as the week went on, but it hasn't. 

I'm not going to lie, I wanna use too. Badly. You know how it is. But I'm kinda happy. I love my job, I'm good at it, and I don't feel so empty anymore all the time. Maybe I can stay clean. But she is intent on going this weekend. Like 110%. 

If she goes and brings it home, I'm going to end up using. I'm very worried that if I ask her to do it on her own away from me she will OD. She has never shot herself up before, and she's always telling me not to ""baby"" her in regards to her dosage when I used to shoot her up. 

How can I approach this? I've said I'm unsure about it. I've told her if her connect isn't around let's just forget it then.. and instead she tells me ""oh fuck no this is happening.""

What do I do? I'm already so anxious and looking forward to using, but I'm not sure I even want to? My stomach is doing backflips in anticipation of something I don't really even wanna do.

Well, 5 minutes later he come out of the store, reaches into his pocket and says ‚Äúhow about this? Will this help you?‚Äù And hands me 2 $50‚Äôs.  I was speechless. 
I hugged him and could only say thank you thank you. 

He said God told him to help me when I walked passed him at the A&W.  

My Dboy is gonna be here in 15 minutes.  Thank you JJ. 

TL:DR: Outside a store, guy walks up and hands me $100 when i was gonna be broke the whole day. ",1512676596.0

I'm down to 60mg from 100mg in mmt. I have had all of my take home bottles for 4 years. I have been at 60mg for a while now and I am comfortable with my dose for now. But I get nervous about picking up my 6 bottles on Fridays because in the morning I feel like crap getting ready to go up there without a dose. So I am wondering if taking omeprazole does make the methadone last longer. I know people say to take 20 mins before but I made the mistake of taking it after taking my methadone this morning. Also wondering if it does help the dose last, will my mistake of taking the omeprazole after instead of before still help?",1512676058.0

7i8lg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7i8lg9/quitting/,21,https://redd.it/7i8lg9,honeybunchesofOPES,Quitting,"I see all of these posts with encouragement for people that are struggling - whichever part of the process they are at and I just wanted to chime in to say:

Thank you. I‚Äôm going to have to make myself quit (again) tomorrow because I‚Äôm finally at the point where my family‚Äôs quality of life might suffer. I previously worked in a position that made me regularly in excess of $250k a year but I was traveling 60% of the year and started using Rx to cope with the depression of missing lots of family events (I missed my sons first birthday & Christmas). 

I quit that job and reinvented myself in a different career and have been able to garner decent money but not enough to support a habit, pay a mortgage, pay for private school, etc. to maintain the facade of normalcy. I have been working in this career field for the last 2.5 years and able to tuck my son into bed every night. I however wasn‚Äôt able to reinvent myself in the sense that I still take pills. I am spending money that I shouldn‚Äôt to cope with another unhappy and stressful situation at work. 
The content of my current job and the schedule are extremely satisfying. I however have been working with a man that has hit on me (in varying degrees of intensity) over the past year and a half - most could be easily and jokingly (phrases such as ‚Äúoh haha thank you that‚Äôs flattering but I think I would disappoint you) dismissed but this summer I was actually propositioned for sex while my wife was away. I had to actually be very stern that I‚Äôm straight and was not interested in having sex. Since June this person has withheld business and effectively reduced my income by $50,000. I‚Äôve been seeking out a new position (both in current industry & prior) since July when I saw the writing on the wall after the sexual harassment. 

I‚Äôm at another crossroads now. Yesterday I was offered a position in my previous industry as an employee ( I was a consultant when I raked in the $250k) for $120k + vehicle + several other intangibles since it‚Äôs one of the largest MNC in the world. I will certainly have to take a drug test - more than likely urine but I worry about hair since they are able to quantify (somewhat) how much you‚Äôve taken plus I have taken some RX opiates not prescribed to me which would pose an issue. This position has extensive travel (50-60% of the year) but within 1-2 years (it has been explicitly stated) that I would be groomed for an office position. Being away from my family until that happens will be just as difficult as before though because well, I love them. 


Yesterday I was also offered a position at a VERY nice brokerage in an ideal setting that has a tremendous track record. Their lowest producers make $120k and their best make $400k+. I think I could start out very well with my track record over the past two years. I‚Äôm somewhat afraid of that position because it is completely commission based. I‚Äôve spent a lot of money I shouldn‚Äôt and I will need to float myself until I start to close deals.  There is no drug test for the second position. 

I turned in my notice last Wednesday and my employer asked me to close out all projects and then go, which should be next Wednesday. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do but I do know that I need to quit taking pills. I don‚Äôt want to go into details but it‚Äôs no small amount. I have been to rehab once before and got 3 months clean only to fall back into it. I‚Äôve quit and been through withdrawal probably 100+ times over the last 10 years outside of rehab. 

So many scenarios, possibilities, endings and of course I need to quit to ensure that I am able to pass a urine test and there is no necessity for hair. I acquired 8 - 8 mg Suboxone but it‚Äôs so hard to even get to the 24 hour mark unfortunately. I will start these tomorrow I guess. I wonder if anyone here can help me determine initial dosage?

I completely get that all of these problems are first world issues and pale in comparison to what some people go through - but they are real and they are my problems. I am going to have to try and make a good decision for my family and detox at the same time. I‚Äôm tired, confused, excited, scared, and a multitude of other emotions to try and steer my ship correctly. 

Sorry for the long whining post but it‚Äôs tough to share in meetings for some reason. Thank you for listening. Input welcomed. ",1512671876.0

Would you go back?," So after a few days break i went and copped today. I get to the block and right away see a dude that i copped from before but he says he doesn't know me so i park me truck in the parking lot at the end of the block where they always are. Three is two younger dboys one starts grilling me he finally says ok but immediately walks away. I'm used to this hassle, i don't look like your typical junkie, I drive a clean older truck and already come alone. I don't take it personal if i was them I'd wonder about me to, but i have been coming here for a month. I bail out, which you more than often have to do.  I walk back to the first guy i talk to, two more come out he asks if they know me they both say no.  After a little hesitation 1 walks up, easy and smooth transaction. I walk back and say to other one, common man you don't recognize me? You served me a few times. He says hell no, i don't recognize no one. I just say ok and get back in my truck. As soon as i do three squads come flying in. The first one stops in front of the house they are always coming out of. The second goes to go around him, it looked like he was gonna pull into the lot where i was parked. If he wanted me there was nothing i could do about it, i had no where to go. So i popped my bags in my mouth and watched but he through his car in park and got out. It looked like they all got away and i was able to slide out the back of the parking lot being only two blocks from the eway and being in the clear. It's on a vey busy street that is under construction so it took a long time to make it those two blocks. The dboy who said he doesn't recognize anyone was walking in the same direction and staring at me the whole way. 

So getting to my question do you think it would be a bad move to go back? Im not talking about because it's hot, but because they might think i set this up. This spot has a ton of traffic, is been hot this isn't the first or the last time the cops have hit it.  AGAIN I'm not asking if you think i should risk getting stopped by the cops there, but if you would risk getting out for a hand to hand. They were asking if i was a cop not a snitch so i think the worst that would happen is no one would serve me. But idk we all know its part of the game. I think it will be good to try again in a couple days. What do you think? ",1512671273.0

I got lucky and got a free ride into a decent rehab, it had its downs like it was cold and there wasn't a lot of recreation, although it was advertised that they had a ton of recreation, a spa, massages, a gym. Really theres just a lady who came to do hair if you made an appointment on like the 3rd sat of the month which is also family visit time so you have to take time from you visit to get a haircut, a lady who comes once a week to do massages and acupunvture both you only get free the first time (wait, no free massage just acupuncture in the ear only) and if you want it again after that (nvm the $40,000 you pay out of pocket) you have to pay and schcedule it. They had an outdoor shuffle board thing and basketball hoops but it was right next to the bay in November and it was freezing!! Bottom line, I need to be VERY comfortable to reallyh fpcus on my recovery and I cant put this off any longer. I want real opinions from real people on the pros and cons of their recommended rehabs. 

SO please guys, if you've been to rehab, please share your experience here...please recommend a rehab for me!! I have insurance that is pretty much accepted everywhere so I'm hoping that will get me in. Warm, medication help, lots of recreation and activities, a busy schedule, good food, amenities

Also please if there are any you advise to stay away from (example someone said Passages: Malibu is a scam) post it here and the reason. I've had a lifelong battle with opiates and I used to be a whole person! Now I feel like I am nothing and it is time to take my life back.",1512664732.0
