I'm new in this subreddit, so excuse me if this thread aren't allowed.
I want you to follow my detox, so everyone can get some information about tapering off, and what symptoms you will get at which day. I know that everyone aren't the same, but some things is pretty similar.
It's very difficult to cope with these symptoms.
And I also have to talk with someone about this. I'm starting NA tomorrow.

Here's my tapering.
I went from 14mg of Suboxone, tapering 2mg every 14 days. This was okay, only the 7th day was bad but next day you were fine. I became a little manic everytime I wen't 2mg down.

Now I'm out of Suboxone at day 7 and it's horrible. My abuse center only have 2mg strips and now lower dose, so from 4mg to 2mg to 0mg was horrible.
Then I felt okay, after the 7th day after I went from 2 to 0mg.

Day 1: Feeling good, nothing at all.

Day 2. Still feeling good.

Day 3: I become manic and started talking a lot and was wandering around the house like a kid with ADHD (i got ADHD and are manic anyway, but this was deteriorating my manic)

Day 4: Like day 3.

Day 5: Started feeling weird.

Day 6: Woke up at 4AM and was feeling really weird. But managed to sleep again. At 7AM I woke up feeling really bad and the sleep was strange, sleeping in fetal position, my joints hurt, my back hurts, I am crying about things that I didn't think about when I was abusing.
Vomiting, everything hurts, restlessness, lethargy, hypertension, stomach is really bad, depressed. Took a walk and felt a little better. Going to solarium later to sweat, drink a lot of water and take a long bath.

Day 7: Like day 6, just worse.

I'm looking forward to feel good, cause I feel really shit.

Anyone have so advises what to do, and why is the symptoms starting at day 7th? Because the double half life is gone and it's out of my system? Half life is 72 hours, so at 6th day it ran out.

Or do you think he is secretly using? My mom confronted him about this but he gets angry and kind of yells at her and says she can't understand his pain and that he has his way of getting off of it...maybe he's tapering off or what do you think?

My mom is on welfare and is around retiring age but she can't work anymore because she's been in too much physical pain especially starting this year, she barely worked. Her health is deteriorating rapidly because of this ordeal and I'm worried once we run out of money how will we support him when we can't support ourselves... I can barely support myself but I'm trying harder to make extra income so that I can give her support. Please, any advice or suggestions is appreciated

Edit, added: 
What should be expected from someone in withdrawal? 
Average duration of withdrawal, how many weeks? 
How much average food and liquid should be expected to be consumed in a day? 
On average at what rate should he be increasing his foods and liquids throughout recovery? 
Basically, what are the average things we should expect from his recovery to know that he's keeping on track with quitting cold turkey?

I WANT TO PROLONG the amount of time that it sits on the mucous membranes of my glorious unhemerhoided rectal tract .

2) What about when swallowed. What if i want to make my pill last longer. What if i want it to take longer to dissolve and get into my bloodstream? For instance maybe a vicoden . putting it inside of again, a large pill capsule, very thick. (uncrushed) , and swallowing it. Wouldn't it take my stomach longer to dissolve that pill? therefore i would be getting a little less at a time than usual?

So guys, if anyone can help me out without it turning into something that is going to break rules, I would SUPER appreciate it. 

Background: long time high dose opiate user, ALL of which has been given to me as RX's. Circumstances have changed and I am in a position where I need to make the switch to heroin. The problem is that I am the exact opposite of what most people would think takes opiates, RX'd or not. Please don't tell me ""don't do it"". I know the risks and it is an unfortunately well thought out decision. I have so many questions though:

1) I know what neighborhood to go to. Assuming I successfully establish that a person is a dealer... what then? Would it be reasonable to say ""I'm sick, do you have anything that may make me well, I have twenty bucks?""

2) If yes, then what happens from there? Obviously I'm not going to just hand him the money and watch hopelessly as he wanders away, never to be seen again. But, what is the ""proper"" way to complete the transaction? Do dealers just chill on street corners with a ton of dope on them, or is it a ""brb, wait here let me grab it"" sort of thing? 

3) How does the actual exchange of money for goods go? I mean does it just happen out in full view of the world, or do I get led to a more descreet location (I am female so that is frightening).  I mean how does the transaction close...? I hand him money at the same time he hands me dope, real smooth-like like you see in the movies? I almost feel like that whole thing would be making it seem even more obvious. 

4) What physical amount/size of package would i be receiving for $20. I mean, something literally the size of a postage stamp.. bigger, smaller...? 

5) Do dealers usually have several different varieties of dope at a time? For instance like this stuff is really strong but only lasts a few minutes, and this other stuff doesn't hit as hard but lasts longer, etc 

6) Lastly (for now), while I know that obviously there is virtually zero consistency for strength of heroin, with all the cuts and whatnot. But if we are going like middle of the road average quality, what would $20 worth of heroin compare to morphine as?

My roommate wouldn't initially reveal why, but after a little probing it was narrowed down.

&nbsp;

For all I know it could be as simple as my sibling thinking I smoke too much pot and that it's adversely affecting my ability to find a better job. This would be great. It might result in me laughing in their face but in that case I would be relieved and maintain an open mind.

&nbsp;

The other possibility is that someone contacted my sibling with a genuine concern for my well being and hinted that I may be doing H. There's one person I could think of who may approach my sibling with a genuine concern. Still wish they didn't go that route. 

The other possibility is that it came from a middle with a big mouth. He would've said something to his family, then it would've went from one big mouthed family member until it got to one who is a good friend, a straight-edged well-to-do good friend who also couldn't keep it to themselves or simply come to me

In both possible cases, I'll deny and keep my cool. At worst if I'm given a specific accusation I might ask ""where the fuck did you get that idea?""

&nbsp;

Perhaps my sibling is concerned and is taking shots in the dark. In which case I'm good as there's no evidence. Normally I'd think my roommate was concerned and suspected something but I don't think that's the case. My room mate seems to know as little as I do about the specifics of the planned meeting with my sibling later this week.

Or, tie off, get needle into vein, *register completely*, then remove the tourniquet??

I used to shoot heroin all the time at work, as well as shoot/smoke meth (but I'm not really a fan of IV meth). So what else to do besides spend the first two hours on the clock banging coke? Been a great shift so far, that's basically all I've done is prep and shoot coke shots. I have 5.5 hours to go, have a small bowl of weed and a bunch of kpins. Like... why do I get paid for this?

My coworkers need to be breathing down my neck and always in my presence so I don't do things like shoot hard drugs at work and on the clock. 

But nope. I'm all alone. I work a custodial job, but due to its location and government status I'll be able to move a very high paying job if I don't fuck this up. So ya know... gotta stop slamming shit in my veins. I didn't think this job would be like this. Due to this locations reputation I thought it would be strict and disciplinary, but I have way too much freedom, which as of now is a poison for me.

Sorry, literally just slammed my last shot of coke and it was a big one so I had to get a ramble in.

This is a long story and I dont know what im really looking for, support? Maybe just a look at a path youre thinking of taking .Others going through the same shit?
I relapsed in August,2015. I was clean from like February to August, so 6 months. I previously used opiates since 2009. Starting with Oxy 30s and quickly went to heroin. Anyway so when I relapsed in 2015 I started on heroin and got scripts for suboxone so when I ran out / couldnt find any I would just hold off the withdrawals with the subs. This has gone on till right now until yesterday. I was on suboxone for a minute and I was so sick of it. I couldnt shit normally. Not shitting made me feel shitty. So most of the time I just felt like shit. Not being able to shit gave me sharp pains so when I didnt have weed it was just fucking hell. I did not enjoy having to use enemas every 3 days to have the most excruciating pain emerge from my ass. Then afterwards the enema is so harsh my intestines just felt horrid. So I ran out of suboxones and promised myself I would not get another script. That was at the beginning of September. I got to about 60 hours clean and couldnt take it anymore and got high. So I kept getting high all throughout septembet well its october now and im out of money and ways to get drugs.  And I really just want to push through and get off this shit. I dont even know what it feels like to truly feel normal anymore. Everything is controlled by drugs,  am I even truly in control of my brain or is everything subconsciously ran by drugs?  But I dont think I really want to stop using maybe here and there but god damn I just want to get through the withdrawals and be normal for a little bit.
So I took my last dose at about 9:45am yesterday. So it is now 24 hours and I woke up in the middle of the night tossing and turning. My legs kicking and I know I slept but it felt like I just was awake and tossed and turned. I think I can do it. Plus Im about to start treatment for Hep C so I dont want to be withdrawaling while doing all that.",1506951427.0

So here's mine but it's probably not the best story I have more but this is the only opiate related story I have. 

Now mine is nothing short of incredibly embarrassing and a great example as to why harm reduction is so important. Anyway, I was completely opiate naive at the time. I had no clue what my tolerance was and I took more than oxycodone on an empty stomach than I should have. Oh and to make matters worse I was in school in my economics class (so 12th grade) when I began to feel extremely nauseous. I forgot that it was the day that we were presenting projects. So what I thought happened was that I told the teacher I was sick and that there was nothing that I could do so I asked him if I could lay my head down so I wouldn't get sick everywhere.  But sadly that wasn't all that happened. I honestly thought that I slept the entire class but no, my group presented the PowerPoint and I read off each slide. I honestly had no idea that you even could blackout on opiates. Anyway, when I found out what actually happened I asked my friend how I did. The normal thing to do, right? Well I haven't gotten the full story even after all this time but apparently I read really fast and slightly too quiet and I paused longer than I should have when showing off the slides. Which I normally would have done that but I guess I waited longer than I should have. Whoops. Then again I'm not exactly sure if that's really what I did in my drug induced blackout state because the teacher never said anything about it and we got a grade on it so who the hell knows? 


This was also the first time I realised I might have a drug problem.

73rue7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/73rue7/girlfriends_xanax_addiction/,50,https://redd.it/73rue7,watermelonanarchist,Girlfriend's Xanax addiction,"Hey guys, I'm not sure where I should post this conaidering the drug in question is a benzo and not an opiate, but I'm sure most of you are very familiar with alprazolam as well. 

From June 5-September 5, 2017, I was a daily Heroin user. I started off smoking it for about a month before shooting for the remaining two months of my addiction. I'm currently enrolled in an outpatient rehab program where I have been prescribed a dose of 6mg of Buprenorphine. I know what addiction and physical dependence to drugs is like, which is why I'm having trouble understanding why she didn't tell me what she was struggling with.

We're both on probation for marijunana possession charges, hers occuring in January and mine in April of this year. We've been best friends since August of 2016 and only recently (July I think) began having an intimate sexual relationship. We've done heroin together, she knows the full extent of my addiction, and I made sure that she would never become addicted the way I was when it came to dope. That is--heroin being the main thing I was trying to hard to keep her away from. I never thought that she would ever have a problem abusing xanax.

Anyway, she told me a few nights ago that she was using the drug way more frequently than she had originally told me. I was worried for her saftey, knowing how benzo withdrawls can cause seizures and even death in the most severe cases. She says shes been doing it daily for about a month as a coping mechanism to forget about a date rape she experienced in June as well as her horrible home life and her abusive alcoholic father. We're both 18, but haven't yet graduated high school, so the two of us are still living at home and its really hard for her to deal with because of the way her parents treat her.

I would've understood if she had told me sooner before it had gotten as bad as it is now (she takes a dose as high as 8-10mg of alprazolam a day) and wakes up with intense anxiety, irresistable cravings, and bad withdrawl effects. She says that she's only been getting sick for the past week, which makes me hopeful because when I first started getting sick from heroin it was nowhere near as bad as it was when I sought treatment. 

Anyway, I have some phenibut that I plan on giving her to ease her withdrawls as a sort of ""xanax methadone clinic"" type of fashion. I told her that the next time I see her I'm going to give her a gram or two right when she starts getting sick (depending on how much it takes for her to start feeling better) and then give her a half of that dose to take home in order to prevent abuse. I trust her more than anyone else I know besides my father, but I don't trust her self control (of which she has none).

I saw her tonight about two hours ago before she had to go home, but at the time I hadn't thought of giving her any phenibut to take home. She doesn't have any xanax left as far as I know of, but she has gone at least 24 hours without it this last week without having any severe withdrawl symptoms like seizures or anything potentially life threatening.

(I know you guys are gonna say that she should go to rehab or a doctor to have official treatment done, but right now that isnt an option. Her parents are bad people and wouldn't help her, but punish her for being a drug addict if she came out to them. Giving her phenibut to replace the xanax is the only way I see working at the moment.)

I have two questions here:

1. She says shes been using xanax daily for a little over 31 days and has only started experiencing withdrawl symptoms this last week. Since she doesn't have any xanax (or money), she wont be able to get well tomorrow for most of the day (unless one of her friends does her a favor like the did today) (I also cannot see her during the day because we are both on probation and have the same PO, who specifically ordered that we not see eachother) so I will not be able to buy her xanax or give her phenibut until tomorrow night around 10 or 11pm. If she goes the whole day without any xanax, is there a possibility she could have a seizure or even die from the withdrawls during that short period of time? 

2. I've done a lot of research on Phenibut on the internet (and I also just took a gram 4 hours ago) and it has the same effects as xanax, it feels exactly like xanax to me (but more mentally stimulating) so, could I help her out by doing a controlled benzo-replacement therapy ""program"" by giving her Phenibut to get rid of her withdrawl symptoms and cravings?

Thank you guys so much, I really love this girl and want to help her as soon as I possibly can. Her life means more to me than my own, and I want to do everything in my power to ensure that she makes it out of this thing alive. :)

New to Reddit but I just wanted to share!!,"I've been doing a variety of opiates for 10+years. It was the fucking bane of my existence. I loved it and hated it. I always wondered(usually while I was super high) was it true? Was it truly better on the ""clean"" side of life?! I'm here to tell you guys that yes, holy shit yes, life is amazing now. I've been clean for two months and I can't even express the joy I feel at not having to snort anything to fucking function. Here's some background info, so I started out using opiates after a kidney stone I had at 18yrs old. And by use I mean ABUSE. I had no experience with opiates before this but I instantly loved them. Spent the next 12 yrs and countless thousands of $$$ and I was fucking hooked. Couldn't find my way out. Withdrawals are a bitch. I would literally snort some oxy, and then stare at myself in the mirror in disgust for the next several hours until withdrawals set in. Then I would wither in pain until I would break and buy more. I'm here to tell you, PLEASE LISTEN, you CAN MAKE IT! I never thought it was possible, I DIDNT EVEN BELIEVE IT WAS TRUE!!! but it is guys, it's better being clean. I would get clean for a few days and then get depressed about how ""boring"" life is without opiates. THIS IS JUST A PHASE AND IT GOES AWAY!!! STAY STRONG! For me, what really helped me quit was cutting off communications with other users(changing my phone number and becoming a homebody for awhile initially) and also surrounding myself with people I respected that had no idea what I was going through. Maybe this is against the normal ""support system"" but my family had no idea I was hooked on opiates and I would DIE if they found out. This helped  me out after I was over the initial withdrawal period. I was so concerned about someone from my family noticing I was having withdrawals that I swear it helped me get over them faster. I would force myself to be ""normal"" (even though on the inside I felt like I was fucking dying) until one day I literally woke up and felt fucking normal. It shocked the holy shit out of me. It was like a switch turned on and I felt ALIVE for the first time in a decade!!!! Of course not everyone's recovery is the same, but this was my experience. The shame I felt at having someone find out about this helped keep me in line until I was over the hump. What also helped was that I moved somewhere far, FAR  away from everyone (all my other opiate user friends) I knew. I think the distance and time helped me gain a better perspective on my outlook on my life. Were opiates fucking awesome? Hell yeah. But compared  to now, where I don't have to make sure I have enough to last or worry about withdrawals, there is literally no comparison. I used to read posts like this and roll my eyes, but it's TRUE. I no longer wake up with those horrible aches and pains, literally DREADING the day, DREADING BEING ALIVE. Like I said, I'm new to Reddit so I don't know if this belongs here on this sub, but I wanted to share this in the hopes that it it helps someone, even one person, that you can fucking do it. It's fucking hard. I'm not gonna lie, I'm in a position (now that I have moved far, FAR away) that I can't even find opiates if I wanted to, and I wonder if I'm really ""clean"" or not. I wonder if I randomly run into someone with access to opiates if I would relapse. I AGONIZE over this. But for right now at least I'm clean and I can only hope and pray that it stays that way.  You can do it. Don't ever give up. Don't ever think it's too late to stop, it's not! I'm with you! I struggle with you! I'm not religious at all(I pray to the Flying spaghetti Monster lol) but I will keep you In my prayers! Please don't ever give up! Please don't ever think it's too late. I'm 30 years old and I'm finally clean, enjoying life, fucking REVELLING IN LIFE!!! You can too!! Just quit, it's not worth it! I sincerely hope this post reaches at least one person! ",1506931118.0

So, silly me, took about 8mg earlier in the week, not taking into account that I probably didn’t need it as I’ve been off the booze.

I doubt you'll take offense and if you do,know I didn't mean it that way. Anyways to get to the point of this post. I just want to tell all of you. I want to scream it to you all. You are fucking loved. Everyone of you is loved by someone. No matter how low you may think you are. Someone out there wants to see the best for you. Drugs are a choice that turns into a disease. It rewires your brain into the desire and urge we call addiction. We have that same choice to stop the maddening cycle. We have the strength to do it. I know you all do. If I can you can. Us addicts are some of the most creative, imaginative, persuasive, competent, strong willed, loving, patient, helpful, caring individuals on the planet and I know that's true because I've had the please of meeting. Hundreds of addicts. It's this disease that destroys who we are at our core and fools us into thinking the person we are in our addiction is the person we are at our core. But that is such a HUGE LIE. We deserve happiness. True happiness. And it can be found through sobriety. I've only got 5 months but I'm telling you. I'm so excited to wake up each day doing something I love. Helping other addicts who are suffering. Sobriety comes with real emotion, drive, initiative, charisma, some pain from the wreckage of our past, true insight, real friends who care about you and who you actually care about. So many many many great things! I'm not saying you all need to stop! (Well, that would be the shit) but I wholly accept I have no control over what you all end up doing. Just know the life after addiction waiting for you is far far far beyond greater than any drug high. You are special. And you deserve inner peace. I love all of you. And you will be in my thoughts. I just wanted to express this to you guys because I don't know who this will help but even if it's just one person, than I am ever grateful. So again, love you all. Goodnight. ",1506907477.0

But people ask ""why do you use heroin? You know it's only gonna end badly"" or drug users ask ""why heroin? There's other good drugs out there. Get clean with pot/kratom!"" (LOL).

And the only answer is that I simply love heroin. 

It's got such a great personality. It's perfect for all situations. A low dose for energy, high dose for sedation. Euphoria without neurotoxicity (unlike amphetamine, my previous love...amph turned on me hard and fucked me up bad with long term panic attacks, anxiety, and crushing depression). 


It takes the one universal shitty thing for almost all living organisms -pain- and erases it. It takes the worst thing about being human -mental anguish- and cures it (however temporarily).

It doesn't lose it's magic. Other than tolerance, which is a characteristic of all drugs, it'll give you the same effect every time. 

That's what so bad about it: it's literally Sunshine in a Bag. No matter what is going on, you dose some heroin and you feel good. It's the cure to literally everything. No other drug can do that. That's what makes opiates different and more dangerous than other substances. 

Depressed? Heroin makes it better. Happy? Heroin makes it better. Entire family died in tragic accident? Heroin makes it better. 

It never gets old. Amphetamine got old, eventually. After it lost the magic, I grew to hate the cold buzz of speed, no matter how much I needed it to stave off the exhaustion and anxiety and depression. 

Heroin can stop working on an individual level, when things get bad enough. This is not an advertisement for heroin. I've gone through hell because of it and wish to God i never experienced the opiate bliss because it fucked up my base-level happiness. 

And now I'm that idiot typing up an ode to heroin on an opiate forum because I love an inanimate chemical. A chemical that has caused me immeasurable agony. 
 
I can't tell this to anyone in my actual life because they'd think I was crazy. I don't know how to deal with loving heroin: when I'm clean there still that bit inside of me that remembers and loves it. On a deep level I love it.

I've dealt with alcohol and amphetamine addiction. I went through delirium tremens, and used speed daily for over a year. Eventually I got sick and tired of these drugs and managed to stop with a little bit of help, because the love wasn't there. I *liked* these drugs, a LOT, but I didn't love them. So quitting them was difficult but eventually things got back to normal. Since they turned on me and SUCKED towards the end I was able to stop liking them. 

But heroin is magical, and no matter how bad things get, that first dose of the day, or after something goes wrong, is *stiil* magical. 

After crashing my car while nodding off and having to deal with that, which was awful and horrible and made me realize how shit heroin made my life, I found a missing gram and immediately dosed, and suddenly everything was better. When I got a DUI from drinking, the next time I drank I just felt sick and guilty and still horrible. 

Anyways, shitpost rambling over. Fuck heroin for being so amazing and lovable.",1506883985.0

Not dead, just professoring (who knew professoring was so much work?)  Last week, I realized that my 2 g of fentalog was running low, and proceeded to do a very brief taper, after being on (at least) a maintenance dose for the last three months.

Funny what your brain does when you're totally out.  You start thinking about every place you might have left a trace of the stuff.  After licking the bottle clean yesterday, I remembered this morning that I spilled some in my backpack the other day.  Waking up in acute withdrawals, I spent the morning licking every corner of the inside of a particular compartment of my backpack where the spill occurred.  Damn this stuff is potent -- I felt better within minutes.

On the plus side, I can poop again.  Diarrhea is sure to follow, but for now, I'm at a good place in terms of bowel habits.  Funny how the second longer, stinkier and more poop-filled brain keeps my bigger, more neuron rich brain honest when it comes to drug use.  Without all the sophisticated feedback mechanisms present in its upstairs counterpart, the gut brain develops no tolerance, and it knows better than the skull brain when my fent use has started to spiral out of control into a binge.   

With more than a 5 mg a day dosage, it goes into a coma:  You keep eating, but not so much as a fart comes out the other end for days.  You start sticking things in your out-hole, in hopes of getting it to behave more like an out-hole, but results are less than encouraging.  And the things you've had to do to it fills you with shame.  Eventually, you realize the only solution is to cut down on your usage.

My big question...you never let your money walk..but that's the main way they separate themselves from actual ""selling"" by making one boy take the money and another provide the dope. They're letting their money walk?!

In my dream my wife left me, which she has threatened to do recently, and the feeling I had was the fuckin worst.  It felt so real and I just remember saying over and over ""just give me a week"" trying to convince her to stay so I could prove I could quit.  I was so desperate and I DO NOT want that feeling in real life.  I almost overdrafted my account yesterday to cop and I'm so glad I didn't bc that dream would have been a lot closer to reality.  We have a lil 18 month old boy who is the shit and I couldn't imagine life without either of them.  The worst part is he didn't even register in the dream, just my wife, so I could imagine the pain of losing them both being 10 times worse.

I just came clean to her about my use a couple weeks ago and told her I would quit.  I didn't, she caught me nodding on methadone and threatened to leave.  That was a first but for some reason it didn't really sink in.  I continued using like the fucking selfish prick that I am but I'm hoping the sheer desperation I felt in that dream will be the motivation to stay away.

My girl and I have been on a break this past week. Low dose subbing for the first few days and then we grabbed a half of some garbage dope to let the subs unbind to us. 

Well apparently we got a half of some fire last night and I fell off. I blacked out and was moving around unconsciously for most of the night. My girl recorded me and inbetween nods and unconsciousness, I was thrashing and hitting myself. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? I've had this happen maybe 2 or 3 times aside from this but I always attributed it to polysubstance use. Last night, all I had was dope. A .5 klonopin from the morning but I don't think that would trigger this. 

The episode scared my girlfriend and she almost called 911. Anyone else have experience with this? Was it a mild overdose? The thrashing looked scary as fuck and the only thing I can think of is that I was so itchy and unconscious that I would thrash and hit myself. 

Just wondering if anyone had a similar experience or any info on what could have happened. Thanks guys and keep nodding on. ",1507043506.0

not trying to make a neg post or seek attention from anyone, I am just eager to see what people can reflect on about their opiate use, perhaps their views on life with or without substances and why they choose to live. Just kind of pondering the poor essence and lack of value that comes with a life absent of substance. I can't understand the value of the monotony or the tribulation of a life filled with repetition and mundane.

I'm wondering if anyone has experience of kratom raising their opiate tolerance so that they need to take more to feel even anything? I take kratom everyday for my lower back, and have been for about a year, with added T-break days. Before I started using kratom, 10mg hydrocodone was enough to take the pain away and 20-25mg was enough to feel euphoric. 

Ever since I started kratom I noticed that even 25mg of hydrocodone isn't enough to make me feel anything? I've even went up to 35mg spread out in two dose over two hours and still nothing. I'm afraid to take too much and have it all hit me at once, if that's possible. Has anyone had this similar issue? 

I've read online that some people speculate kratom occupies certain opiate receptors, which causes there to be no room for anything else, in turn making your opiates useless while kratom is in your system. One guy online said it took 3-4 days of no kratom use to be able to feel opiates again? ",1507039976.0

solider up through another walk. Tonight it is very brisk and the sky is clear with nothing but the bright moon illuminating my path. 

Each second is measured by a step. 
I'm trying so hard to focus on the music. 
The sounds. 
The instruments. 
Anything to drown out the loud thoughts from my frantic brain. Trying to get a micro rush of endorphins going through the sound of a sick guitar riff. 
It is 1am and going to be yet another sleepless night. 

I had been up for 3 hours after a short nap. As soon as i opened my eyes, panic set in. I had done my last bag 3 hours prior to the nap so I was nearing 7hours. 
the feeling of dread and fear was brewing inside of  me. 

I'm playing the ""waiting-for-direct-deposit-to-hit"" game, in which so far no luck. 
Usually in the past my check always cleared by midnight-2am, so I think, okay just one more hour tops. 
It's a   (mildly annoying) routine-- I periodically check my account from the time midnight hits (usually in mild to sever WD because I can NEVER successfully ration the day before) then the money shows up, me and my bf run to the spot and then sweat baby jesus the relief hits and I sleep! Wash rinse and repeat! 

I walk long and drawn out laps in my apartment complex. The moon is so bright and I look up and wonder how many others are wandering, lost, broke and sick in the same city as me under the same moon. 
I try to remind myself I could be worse, infact the situation could be so much worse: I have a roof over my head and funds coming in for sure. 

I alternate between walking, coming back to the appt. shifting uncomfortable positions on my bed watching crime docs and mysteries. I roll my ""desperation cigs"" (tobacco cut out of used cig butts and re-rolled *yum*) and check my account. 

Constant disappointment. 
$0.02. 

Literally two cents in my account. 
My anxiety is heightening and the more I move around the more I don't notice it. But I'm getting tired and weak and my brains starting the mess with me. Especially because,

2:15am nothing. Check again at 230. Nothing. Keep checking in 30 min intervals.

It's 330am and panic sets in. 
I go on another walk but this time I'm checking car doors hoping to find one unlocked with money inside.
Of course nothing. 
I look at the moon and curse at it. 
Before I become immersed into being a junkie, I used to be quite spiritual and often draw energy and power from the moon. But that's long gone. 
 
My boyfriend is at the appt WDing as well, so the energy inside is all jacked up. I try not to go home. I don't want to be inside those walls. I don't want to stare at my belongings with literally no emotion or regard for anything. I don't want to shower. 
I'm jealous of how well my bf takes WD. He just plops on the bed and passing time successfully watching movies. 
I however can't stand still. I hit things just because the force of doing so feels good. My limbs naturally jerk anyways. 
All I want is to cuddle with him and be held. I want him to whisper it'll be okay while he brushes my hair and tears. 
And yet I can't stand still. 

Now it's 430am and I've just accepted that this might be a flook or for whatever reason my account is on hold for being so low? Idk. But I give up checking. It's just torture. 
I start to look up sub induction and what to do if I get PWD. I have two I was saving for an unfortunate time. 

5am bf asks me to check and I'm like ""eh I'm just going to be disappointed"" but Fuck it I do it anyways and there it was. 
$2330 in green, available. 
My heart sinks and my sweat and shakes stop for that very glorious moment.
""GET DRESSED AND GET YOUR SHOES ON"".

We anxiously speed to the spot in the hood and like clockwork, my bf gets us the goods and we are headed back to get well in the same apartment I had been loathing the last 6hours. 

It's 630 am and I'm finally well. But it's hard to shake off the hell I just endured the last 8 or so hours. And that wasn't even bad. I would say mild WD generally and I still struggle BAD. 

This is the life I've come to know and live daily.



Thanks for anyone who read this. Again, this is basically just a blog post. I know personally I like reading real accounts of the day in the life of an addict so hopefully some of you can relate. Take care my friends. 

Tldr; I spent the early hours of this morning in WD waiting for a direct deposit to hit. It was late but I'm good now. Just my point of view and experience.

Normally it gets me a little to fairly high. I've discovered that adding 5mg valium and I'm in dreamland. Like proper nodding out, crazy dreams, coming to talking about whatever was going on in my head, making zero sense of course. Never been so high in my life.

Now I know this is dangerous, and I've decided not to do it often at all, and I will definitely never increase the amount of alcohol (makes me so very sick) or valium. I was curious, though, as to whether replacing the 5mg valium with say 10mg temazepam would be any safer, or even produce similar results.

Nice to be back, by the way :)

Edit: so my regular 200mg wasn't doing shit. Down the hatch is now around 8-9mg promethazine, 10mg temazepam and half a beer. I'll probably take the drinking quite easy. I'll get back with a report.

Edit 2: I had around 4.5 standards and nearly threw up. Otherwise everything went as expected. I couldn't tell the difference between the val and the temazepam. ",1507032712.0

I have a long ass story and I'm not gonna tell the whole thing but I'll summarize I used opiates ever since I was about 15 stealing pills from my step dad and literally stealing 2 bottles with 120 hydrocodone from my ex gfs dad and then dropping her and not talking to her for months. That's how it started. Then eventually went on to heroin cause I ran out of pills and then my dope plug got caught in the high school I was in and then I got a dilly plug and got em for like 2 bucks a milligram. So I bought the whole bottle and once again ran out then went on to the dnm for dope and that's when it got kinda bad but then I actually got clean for 8 months due to a fucking eye opening trip on DMT. Like insuflated 300mg of Dmt.. That's a shit ton.. Then I think 2 December's ago my friend and I started going to cop dope and that was when it was my second worst time cause that's when I first shot up. And then after that I was good. I was on Kratom for a year and a half successfully but in recent times I started experimenting with research chems and chia seed tea. And now I've been on a huge dose of chia seeds for like 6 months.. Which is actually the longest I ever used consecutively.. Before that the most was about a month..
So now I need to quit again for a while and stay on Kratom and actually be happy and enjoy my life.. But I'm scared to death... I'm scared that I'll never be happy again. I'm scared that I won't enjoy anything in my life. I'm scared to go out and socialize again and make friends.. I'm tired of being isolated with me and my gf and having literally no friends.

Wanna catch up with you guys.,"It's 12:23 AM here in the great PNW, and I'm on night 4 of no sleep. It's been a very engaging couple weeks. In the past 16 days I've done heroin twice, but holy fuck have I continued the mission of making boundaries just to break them. I've been shooting a shit load of cocaine, a shit load of meth, and smoking a little bit of crack. I also at one point did some MDMA throughout 1 of the 16 days, can't remember which one right now. Ya know, I've cut way back on heroin, but I don't think I've actually made any progress. 

I saw a lot of coyotes today. They weren't actually there, but I saw them. Lately has been the farthest I've ever gone with abusing meth. Before I would do it like this, a friend of mine had a pretty bad IV meth habit and we always called him a window peeper, because he'd always be gacked as fuck intensely staring out any available windows in a rapid rotation for hours on end. I'd do my meth my way, then eat and sleep and hydrate and ya know, actually draw boundaries. Well today I was looking at those fucking coyotes for hours. I'd tell myself I'm just trippin because meth and sleep deprivation, but I would look out the window again and be like, ""Okay but wait no that one is definitely real. I'm totally not wrong this ti - Oh fuck. Yep I'm a window peeper. God damn it."" Like this is a line that I have crossed, just like all the other ones. I used to have a boundary at IV drug use. Now it's basically I don't even consider other ROAs a real option. Like there isn't another way to do it now. I also over amped on meth yesterday, made a post about it over in /r/Drugs. I would definitely say this last year holds the record for damage of personal life and severity of self destruction. 

It's also been a reoccurring thought to me that I'm lying to myself in a couple areas I thought I had covered. I believe that no matter how shitty or good things are, outside of our own perception there are really no expectations or standards, so everything is always exactly how it's supposed to be. I also try to have the perspective that nodoby who goes through an addiction problem has a smooth or easy ride, so I must be doing it right. If it felt easy that must mean I don't care enough or don't recognise the how high the stakes are. But lately I've been wondering if all those thoughts are just a coping mechanism. I have a feeling that our existence is ultimately meaningless and hollow, and I hate looking at it that way so I try to throw some color in there. 

I must still be high if I typed all this out. I seriously need to close my eyes and hope for the best though, because now the letters on my phones keyboard are getting wavy. That's really all I have to say to you guys, just don't do meth and remember that we'll probably die very confused and that's totally okay.",1507017558.0

Long story short, I needed to grab a couple grams cause I was leaving the city for a bit and wouldn't have any connects so I asked him to middle for me. He was dopesick so I offered to get him high if he could hook me up.  When I get out of the city, I start dividing my shit into daily rations and I'm missing like $80 in dope. Cause of that I was sick for like 4 days at the end of the trip. I can't prove it but I'm pretty sure he ripped me off because he thought I wouldn't notice. I think this because everything was in .1 bundles and several were missing and I'm sure if the dealer handed him clearly less than he asked for  would have said something. 

It really pisses me off that he would just do that and think I wouldn't notice. I make enough money that $80 isn't that big of a deal, it's more that he knew I would be sick and didn't care. On the other hand he's completely broke, living with his parents and spending all his money on drugs so maybe he was desperate enough to get to that point. Still, we've been best friends since grade school and it's fucked up that he'd screw me over like that. I don't want to cut ties with him because he's been my friend for so long and it's only $80 but stealing from your best friends is a pretty big betrayal of trust.

I'm sitting in my car and next thing I know I started hearing gunshots then all of a sudden I hear loud screams coming from not too far away so I text my boy and I let him know what's going on turns out his daughter was attending that concert and he didn't know that it was happening so here I am sick as a dog wondering what's going on and if I'm going to be able to get my s***. What's really crazy though is once he told me that his daughter was attending the concert all my selfish ways went away and all I could do was worry for his daughter.

So I tell him forget about me make sure that your daughter is safe I'll be alright so I go home and sleep and hit him up as soon as I wake up asking him how his daughter is. Thank God his daughter ended up alright but the guy that she was with got shot in the leg and they had to go to the hospital. Well he tells me to come to the hospital if I need anything so I go up there and I make sure that I bring flowers and get well and I give it to him. He even looks at me and says thank you I don't know any other customer that would have done that. In return not only did he not charge me for the half that I was going to originally pick up he tossed me an extra 3 G's for free. So my prayers go out to all of those that are injured and especially to those who lost family members in the tragic incident that happened in my hometown. It's crazy to think you hear about things like this happening all over the world but you never think that'll happen to you or the place that you live until it does. Just like the drug game you tell yourself that you would never OD you think that you never will and tell you do. So be safe everybody and remember that anything can happen to anybody at any time.",1507003553.0

I finally got 2 subs I'd been hunting for a good friend of mine then headed to get high and chill. After I got to her house we got high which is great. Then we went to buy scales and picked up a giant slice of pizza each. Probably the best pizza I've ever had. Got the scales and headed back and ate and then I sold a half G to my cousin. With the money from that we went and got a hooka, shisha, and junk food. It's fantasia rainbow shisha which tastes like fruit punch. Got sour patch kids of course, Snyder s honey mustard and onion pretzel pieces (so fucking amazing!), Twix, butterfingers and a few other junk food delicacies and we got more high. I did like 5 other shots I haven't mentioned. Now we are watching rick and morty, smoking the hooka and just chilling. I know this is a worthless shitpost that doesn't matter to anyone but today's the best day I've had in a very long time and I felt the need to share it with the world. I'd like to thank my friend. Dunno if she's cool with me posting her Reddit name but this is the best time I've had in many months. 

Also are there any hooka fans on here and if so what shisha would y'all recommend? Nothing menthol lol.

Sometime last week I gave my friend 80 for 2 gs (I said d biddle cuz he's kinda halfway between dboy and middle) and had to wait around for his reup.  I gave him the money up front because he needed it to re and I get a better deal that way, it's usually 50 a g.  I had done this many times in the past with no problems so I trusted him.  It started getting later and later so he said he could just bring it out to us and my wife and I went back to the weird spot we were living in 6 miles outside of town.  He didn't pick up his phone for the rest of the night and we eventually passed out.  The next day after hours of his phone being off I finally talked to him, he said his plug had ghosted on him the night before but that he would have it soon and still bring it out to us.  Then stopped picking up his phone again for the rest of the day.  Around sunset we said fuck it and walked the six miles to town cuz we lost our ride.  When we got to his spot he wasn't around and still not picking up his phone.  We hung around his spot in town for a while and he finally texted around 11:30 at night that he was a couple of towns over but didn't respond when I asked if he had it and when he was coming back.  Finally around 2:30 am he called to say that there was 1 gram stashed outside the rv in our spot and that it had worked out to be more expensive but he would still give us some undisclosed amount soon, he also claimed that he had dropped it off hours before which made no sense as he would have told me when he first texted.  Anyway after a long drawn out process of asking people for rides and waiting on tweakers being tweakers we got a ride back and the gram was there.  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was waiting to pickup a couple towns over but found out he had gotten it much earlier that day and had just gone over to the casino, even though our town has a casino too!  Anyway the next few days he keeps not picking up the phone and I check at his spot once or twice a day but he's never around and is making no effort to get us the rest of what he owes us.  We are staying well by running into people with dubs on them here and there but not finding any steady connects.  Then about 4 days down the line I'm leaving his spot and this Mexican dude in a SUV asks me if I've seen him and a lightbulb goes on and I say ""no, but you got any black?"" and he says yeah and I ask for a g so he says 40 but when I hop in and give it to him he breaks off a big chunk and says ""this is almost 2 grams"" and I grab his number and ask for his name and of course it's the biddles plug!  So dude can keep the other 40, I've since learned that he generally just sells 5 g chunks for 100 though I did meet him one other time and get 3 gs for 70.  The biddle is still MIA just have to get some clients now and I'm set!

My life gets better every day since I've quit, but that's not what this post is about.

So I'm a store manager at a high end grocery store in my state. My store is located in center of my states biggest city, so homeless are everywhere. It's not unusually to catch a homeless passed out drunk or nodding off in our parking lot. 

Well it's part of my job to get them off company property.  I truly do feel sad for having to do it but the area my store is in has high class clientele and we receive daily complaints about the homeless begging, being passed out in the middle of the parking lot and the syringes, SOOOO many used rigs ditched in my parking lot. 

So yesterday I had to kick this homeless middle eastern guy out of the store because he was shop lifting and got caught shooting up in the female bathroom. It was a whole ordeal, him screaming and spitting on me the whole time. I decided not to call the cops because even though I'm clean I'm still a junky and I know what he's going through. 

I escorted him to the edge of our parking lot but I couldn't legally force him any further so he set up camp right on the edge. So I finish my shift and I go out to my jeep, which was where he set up camp, and I noticed a small tote bag with a blanket in it. I didn't think anything of it and was about to drive off when I got curious and decided to go through it. 

I emptied the bag and only the blanket came out. I then unfolded the blanket to find a whole bunch of uses foils with A LOT of smokeable tar on them and what had to be at least three points of tar in a ziplock baggy. I was blown away this guy forgot his dope. I started trying to convince myself to use but I thought long and hard about how far I've come since quitting so i put the foils inside the ziplock and drove around the city for a few minutes and discreetly threw it out my window. 

I hope it got into the right hands and I know you guys are going to think I'm dumb for wasting dope but after I did that and was past the point of no return I felt so good about myself. If only this could have happened when I was using. Sorry for the novel, this is my only outlet to talk about dope and I had to tell someone about this lol ",1506990001.0

- Pop. You miss the vein and get some under your skin. Not too painful, but not pleasant either. Supposedly not a waste as it does eventually absorb, but because there's no rush, its hard to say if you get anything from it at all.

- Histamine reaction. Probably happens to people in UK more often as we have to mix our H with Ascorbic acid (Vit C) to break it down to dissolve to shoot and if you add to much, it seems to make the area on and around your injection site all lumpy and red. Othertimes its the gear for some reason. You can end up with an entire arm blotchy, lumpy, red, itchy and hot. Takes 20 minutes to go back down usually. No shots in the same place during that time or for a while afterwards as the veins are all squashed and you can't see what you're doing.

- Tight vein. It's a small vein in a sensitive area (feet, ankles, back of hand) You go in super slow, register, push at 10ml/min! Yet it starts to sting badly as you near the end of the shot, sometimes you can pull back a bit to reregister.. sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't - meaning you've either skin popped half your shot by accident or the blood has stopped flowing back and pushing further causes pressure to build, but it still gets you. Sometimes you get a burning sensation that close to artery-town, but it never truly explodes into the type of pain where you *definitely* know you've fucked up!

- Lumpy skin. After a while using the same vein in the same area of the body it stops hitting. Maybe its truly dead and not working any more or perhaps you just can't find any more space along it to hit. When you run your finger along to look, instead of the telltale raised vein all you feel are a bunch of lumps and bumps. They're not abscesses and they're not liquid trapped under the skin.. perhaps its scar tissue or bruises.. whatever it is, its sensitive swelling that feels like a Klingon's forehead.


Anyone got any others? I've experienced all of these in my time, but all damage has cleared up when I'm clean and I don't seem to have any lasting damage. Even my tracks faded away to virtually nothing. A few nice veins came back too after a year of stopping prodding them with sharp spikes!",1506973205.0

I've spent some time here on and off since I found reddit via this subreddit from my brother's browser history after he OD'd. It was almost 2 years ago. I don't think he ever posted based on my hacking skills, I could never find a username. But I assure he was in this sub every single day for 2 months until he died. 

And now my best friend's husband, who was also a regular here just died last week. I am not sure if he posted or just lurked like my brother, but she said he'd mentioned stuff he read on reddit. He learned to be a ""safe"" user here. 

Okay I really am not here to call anyone out or shame anyone or anything like that, but my friend and I are both left with the desire to help. I don't want one more family to suffer like this. My family has been completely torn apart, and my best friend now has to raise their children alone. She is a total wreck. I used to come here and share Jesse's story because sometimes a few of you would message me and say it helped you not use that day. And that felt good. I also became a licensed foster parent and am currently foster mom to an opiate withdrawing foster baby. I thought maybe fostering drug addicted babies, and showing love and compassion for the parents who have had their children removed, would bring some help. 

But what else can we do? I want to turn these devastating losses into something positive, somehow.

Most of the time, I absolutely hate having a vagina. If I was religious, it would be very easy to believe that women are being permanently punished for Eve's fuck up, because everything about being a woman tends to suck massive ass. Periods suck, cramps suck, childbirth sucks, and more that I could go into, but suffice it to say that I am jealous of men, often. 

      
But as far as hiding spots go, there's really nothing more secure than a pussy! My vagina is the only way I make it through the supervised drug testing at my job. I've got a small lotion bottle full of pee in there right now, and all I have to do is squat and pop the top on it, a lot easier than what my bf has to go through trying to hold it under his dick without the guy seeing.

...So far this is the first month in 7 months that I haven't had a 3+ day hospital stay. I'm really proud of myself for that. It's also the first month in 3 months I haven't required an early refill. I successfully tapered from 80mgs to 15mgs per day in ONE month. However, when I get my refill later this week I will jump back to 30mgs per day. I think that's sustainable now. I'm planning on asking my doctor for ninety 10mg oxys and then only take 20mgs per day and build a reserve stash for those days when the pay is outstanding/horrid.

Around 10 I start getting a splitting migraine and next thing I know my limbs are shaking uncontrollably. Idk if I was having a seizure as I never lost consciousness and was never confused. Just tremors. It lasted around 20 minutes. Luckily I had a qtr of a bar in my ""oh fuck"" stash.

I just wanted to ask, what are yalls thoughts on this. Did I seizure? Has this happened to anyone else?

Thanks for reading.

744xzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/744xzy/drunk_ron_and_the_birdman/,4,https://redd.it/744xzy,Sangroscura,Drunk Ron and the Birdman.,"I found temporary work out west and even though I’m clean-ish and all that good shit I took my first moment alone in the shade as an opportunity to say high to my fucking boo, Black. It was tar that first got me on maintenance and it had been years. Bu that was in a major city and this was a quaint little beach town without any rough edges I could spot. It was a like sunny Punxsutawney. I’m used to the East Coast way where there’s always that neighborhood everyone knows is drug infested. 

I started with the google. Some guy on some forum complaining about a Latino in a park next to his house that he just knows is selling drugs out of his van. It’s all I had and that’s where I began. Older couple walking their little dog. Cute girl jogging with her little dog. Gay guy walking his little dog. Until finally – a guy doing yoga with his shirt off. He was actually pretty impressive but I took it as a sign that I should try and scope some new leads. I should have quit but once the idea starts floating around in my head it lingers kind of strong.

The 7-11 across from the Mediterranean joint I ate at my first night there. There were a couple of homeless guys right out front. Of course. I start by asking for weed to break the ice and then switch it up and ask him about black. He had an encyclopedic hobo look - raggedy pork pie hat and all, smoking the shittiest cigarettes no one knew existed, torn shoes – but with pajama pants that had kittens on them and they were fresh, clean and crisp. Bird Man he said.

He tells me there are a handful of others that sleep in this canopy near the cushy downtown shops that should be able to help but if not he can call his daughter that just got clean but will certainly know where. I tell him I’m good with just hitting up his homies and letting the chips fall where they may. 

Bird gest to the spot and says “Aww shit. Fucking Ron.” It was early afternoon, Ron was drunker than midnight and in no way ideal for the incognito. I plopped my ass down and against a tree where I could see Bird Man and he could see me. Ron was the only one that was awake. Bird tried to wake up Scott repeatedly because he was the one who would really have the ins. I knew this because he would come over to me and provide the occasional update. Bird asks Ron in between attempts at waking Scott or the gutter punk-y kids sleeping in their spots if he knew anything. 

Ron doesn’t know shit but he wants a light. Bird, smoking a fucking cigarette refuses to give him a light. Come on Bird. Bad form. You’re my dude and Ron makes for a rough scene but give the man a fucking light. Ron is right pissed.

“You won’t give me a light! You ask me to get you fucking heroin but you won’t give me a fucking light!”

This was a high traffic zone with the weekend locals and tourists. I think maybe anyone that was listening to music with headphones on didn’t hear Ron, going on and on. This Viking looking gutter punk and a skater kid that were sleeping in this canopy woke up. Not a wince from Scott. They both yell at Ron to shut the fuck up but Ron kept going on about the light and for good measure the fucking heroin. 

Skater took  Ron’s portable speaker and smashed it against the ground. God damn it. That was just dirty pool. No love across the board for poor Ron, but he’s a burly sumbitch and he’s right pissed yet again and not about to let this one pass and him and skater end up on the ground trying to gouge each other’s eyes out – on top of an undisturbed fucking Scott. Damn you Scott. You’re the MVP and we’re all waiting for you to show up to the game and make it happen. I break up the fight. I feel like I’m responsible for having caused it.

I tell Ron he’s got a couple of scrapes and that he should wash them off at the fountain, distracting him each time he looks back at Scott. And wouldn’t you know it Ron spoke to me with an even, reasonable tone. Everyone was so nasty to him. I thought we’re all cool when Ron decides to wipe the blood from his hands on skater’s hoodie and all hell breaks loose once again. A lady is on the phone with the police and she is asking out loud if any of them have any weapons on their behalf. 

“Shaggy has a jack knife” Ron volunteers. 

Well, shit Ron. I’m starting to see why the other fellas lose their patience with you from time to time. I bounced as did everyone else minus Scott but where there’s a will there is a way and I came back an hour later and hit someone else up who took me across town to another handful of homeless and their encampment next to a bridge and then this and that and I’ve gone on long enough but more waiting and more of that and no I’m not a cop I got my black.

Homegirl used to be consistent but now plays all the usual games with my time and money, and it's starting to get old fast. To make matters worse, her boyfriend also helps with selling and I'm pretty sure he fucked me over outright last night, even though he always acts super friendly. I went to pick up thirty worth of black, and I immediately did a double-take on the baggie he handed me as it literally looked like a point or two, not three. Lo and behold, I get home and throw the little black ball on my ""jewelry scale"" and it read .18. 

Now, I had originally asked for a 20, and they both stay fucked up on tar and Tina, so I'm not sure if they were just disoriented and forgot to throw another point on the original order, or if they simply wanted an extra $10 for no additional product, but it fired me up nonetheless. I'm supposed to be getting a half gram later and I will be weighing that shit the minute I cross the threshold.

I don't wanna start shit, and I don't have other plugs at the ready, but I refuse to give my money to someone who is clearly *not* giving me my money's worth. I don't want to burn this bridge but I want to rattle their cage and let them know I'm not a fucking idiot and that I know my shit is short without losing it and going off on them.

I should probably go to a NA meeting but I'm afraid I'll just find a new connect and start this whole process over again. I want to get high. I'm so sick of feeling too much and feeling nothing at the same time. Opiates have truly been one of the only things that have truly made me happy and I just can't imagine the rest of my life without it. At this point I'm just smoking weed even though it's like a last resort kind of drug to me, I'm only smoking it to get out of my own head even though I don't even like the high. I just want to escape. I want to see the blood register before I push the plunger down. It's sickening... is this what the rest of my life will be like? Just constantly missing something that I can't have? 

I've got Ehlers Danlos syndrome and fibromyalgia and knowing that I'll have to deal with this chronic pain and constant dislocations without any adequate pain relief is so depressing. I've been open about being in recovery with my doctors so now I will forever be given Naproxen or something equally useless to treat my pain for the rest of my life.

Heroin Tears


Her anxious legs, her body feels the absence of the last smoke, the last snort.

She preps her shot thinking it will be boss but down the drain she goes.

She'll fight her mind, her body, her spirit, but doesn't know which way to go.

So her body decides, as she's screaming in her mind, let me go, let me go!

She preps the needle with the spoon as her priorities are left in the dust.

Everything ice cold but not that hole in her arm, it's slowly trickling out blood.

Seconds bring instant comfort, relieving her restless body and anxious mind.

She cannot bear the withdrawals that come along dragging her behind.

A sharp spear laced in poison detracting delicate skin to bruises and scars.

Unit, by unit, her shot dissipates and every inch of her eagerly awaits to embrace the rush of the high. 

As time slips by, the high subsides and she is dry, all insecurities exposed in bare sight.

Panic..on the search..broke..fiending..stealing..robbing..lost loved ones..manipulation..broken promises..

The curse gets worse. It's meaningless synthetic comfort, the happy juice she can never refuse fills her receptors, a matching piece to fit the puzzle

The feeling can't be beat, a silent stream reminding her in her dreams creeping into the sunrise bursting with a desperate scream.

Worry and panic demands her full focus and the lies and deceit don't stop until fear of not having money has subsided. Begging and crying, playing the victim with no rest until she got her fix.

She's not happy, she feels dead. Synthetic pleasure breeds depression, and she's cannot function on her own, she disregards her responsibilities and continues to fail

Her presence overdue, regularly absent she won't pass, she'll miss out on every opportunity or simply won't care for consequences.

Dope is her only interest, where she pours all her energy and effort, she even proposed to forever be a servant, for what she loves most.

So much aggressive energy to remain living, guilt-tripping her lover into enabling her, she get's what she wants.

 Time and time again until she drains his resources, with nothing left to give, he starves.

Confusion blocks her judgment as she believes the sickness is out to get her, but she has exhausted her funds too, tired of depending on her dope dictator, wishing to be free from the physical and psychological deterioration. 

Her best friend heroin left her for dead, locked her in a cage kicking and screaming.

How much do you really love me?? Fight for me and score some more the funds to feed the fire, exhausted, not a dollar to my name.

Validate me, i'm what you need. I'll give you hugs and kisses, dreams of the childhood you never had.

Leave it all in the past because i'm the high that leaves you in a fragile state, mistake by mistake it's the price you will pay.

Near and far, nodding in and out, constantly chasing the dragon. Familiar pleasure filling the lungs provides the sense of stability blocking out pain and discomfort.

Oblivious to the vicious demise quietly poisoning your body, draining your youth as your life is dictated where the abstinence of dope exaggerates the sickness that overruns as you lose control of your life and question your purpose. 

Losing touch with reality, addiction becomes erratic-out of control. You don't recognize the face in the mirror anymore, a slave to an demanding lifestyle draining you from the inside out. 

Not sure your reason to keep living, hoping one day you can beat your disease never looking back. The day came, you're tired, you've given up, you need out. Looking back, you've accomplished not a single thing. 

Only getting older with more expectations, forced to revaluate your progress, found out to be limited to none. You're so done.

Running with open arms into recovery is the only chance you'll succeed, and to breed your goals and dreams you need to believe. To put in your effort and defeat the beast thats waiting for the chance you slip up and bleed. 

Take one day at a time, this is a must, far from simple , but you need to trust. 

In yourself, a higher power, an inspiration, will be the motivation to reclaim your life back, claim true happiness, and become the best version of yourself.

Doesn't actually get me high. In fact, it just has me stuck in a state in which I feel like something is missing , so I wind up mixing drugs to alleviate that. The doses of benzos I take are always on the lower side .. .5-.75mg of xanax is what I usually would take. 
I've been using Xanax and etizolam (1mg) daily with my oxycodone use. I have anxiety problems and I am using these benzos therapeutically - I'm not trying to nod out or any of that shit. I'm just trying to alleviate anxiety. I know it's a band aid and that I need to find a real solution - I need to get off all drugs.. and I know I will if I live just a little longer. 

Today I tried clonazolam for the first time (not clonazapam). I read up on it for a couple weeks before obtaining some. I know 1mg of clam is equivalent to 4mg of Xanax or some ridiculous shit like that. People are idiots and take .5-1mg doses their first time and black out and do stupid shit. I must have taken .125mg of it... I'm scared as fuck about dying in my sleep. My lungs seem to be working on their own as I type - meaning I'm not consciously putting any effort into breathing. Seems like the respiratory system is working okay . I do notice my breaths are a little shallower than usual. What do you do in this situation ? Just wait it out before you sleep ?

That being said, what is the going rate of h in your area? Im in the furthest state south on the east coast and h is notoriously expensive and shitty here. That being said it is possible to find a quality connect, it just takes some searching. All h is either sold in caps or little bags. I have yet to find anyone selling in weight. Most caps ive gotten are filled to the brim and contain what i believe to be between a point or two. These caps can be bought for 20 bucks a pop, all the way up although most dealers will give you a price break around 100 bucks, so 6 for 100 or in some cases 3 for 50. Recently I've gotten a connect whose quality is the best ive had down here and she sells by the bag. Again, 20 a bag and contain a bit less than a fully packed cap. I would say each bag has at least a point in it and some bags have closer to two points. She did 6 for a 100 for  me today and i would say i got between .75-.85, just from my guesstimate. 

I used to live in the middle of the east coast in the dmv area where weight was sold, in between two major cities, one of them being a city known for it's heroin. I had various connects all whom sold halves for around 50-60 bucks and wholes between 100-120. When buying in bulk the lowest i paid per gram was 85 bucks and that's when i bought 7 grams. Straight fire too, i was middling at the time and the order was for around 4 different people. I ended up pocketing around two grams for myself. Those were the days. Also it should be stated that there was this quinine/heroin mixture sold often on the streets that was heavily diluted dope that could be bought for ten bucks and is sold in caps. It's designed for iv users as people who snort would barely be able to even get high off the mixture as it's that diluted.

Improbably, I leave a foil somewhere in my parents house after spending a single night there. I am almost sure my father just made this up to bust me, since I was snorting, but it worked and I fessed up. Two years clean...poof. 

Finally stopped using on Monday after about two weeks of using all day every day. My previous record for continuous use was also two weeks, but I only used in the evenings back then. This was wake up, use, bathroom break, use, get home from work, use, etc etc so I was nervous I had pushed it too far and was going to finally get dope sick. So I stopped.

I won't pretend I went through anything like others have suffered, but I was rattling with the RLS and crawling skin. And the guilt! The shame! The horror, the horror...

Felt so bad I told my partner. I figured I'd get back on subs and she'd never have to know but my conscious got the better of me. Felt so bad, bringing this shit into her life. She's a good girl, never had anything to do with the seedy underbelly of society that we take for granted. So, naturally, she's horrified and I'm crushed and tell her I'm finished with the garbage and things are gonna change. 

She's only known the ""clean"" me, which is me on suboxone, but on subs my depression and anxiety and cravings are all totally gone. Finished college, got a great internship, found the love of my life, all these great things on subs, and I got off cuz I lost my fucking insurance.

 So I go crazy fast and whip together insurance and find a sub clinic AND get an appointment for later this week. I *really* want to get back on subs because as far as I'm concerned, they're the miracle drug. Cured my depression and anhedonia and the only side effect was constipation. The no cravings is just a bonus. 

Anyways.. 

Gonna have to decide whether to get high tomorrow or dump a gram of fire #3 from the darknet down the toilet. So fucking difficult. I've been wanting to try smoking #3 for years and finally have the opportunity. It was supposed to arrive on Monday and if it did I'd still be going strong. But now it's gonna arrive tomorrow, when I'm home alone after I was given the day off for basically no reason. It was going to be my last huzzah, but the gears ground to a halt too soon. 

So yeah. I'm dumping this shit 100% on my own. 

Edit: tried a tiny 3 gram dose of kratom and my stomach is fucked up good. Slowly drinking enough rum to melt away the pain (I usually hate drinking these days but now all I can think about my boy /u/OldDirtyBurton even if I wish he wouldn't talk about drinking gross, nasty alcoLOL all day....

First time, I tried ^(tried) to go carefully and did 200mg in small additions (25-50mg every 15-30mins) in span of 2 hours. Didn't get much euphoria, but more of a sleepiness. After maybe a 1.5 hours from the last dose I suddenly felt extremely nauseous and almost puked, but prevented it with a little bit of weed, which, as I've read somewhere before, usually helps with that.

It's worth mentioning that I'm generally afraid of nausea, don't know why. This time it pretty much freaked me out and left in streams of cold sweat. Awful experience.

Yesterday was my second attempt, a slower one. I did 100mg with a bit of weed first and 50mg more 4 hours later. Nausea this time was weak but persisting. Euphoria had also changed and revealed more pronounced and enjoyable high. This balanced out general serotonin dirtyness of tramadol and I liked it. Second dose hit almost instantly and was so good. You know.

In both cases nausea was ruining everything; or attempting to ruin, all the same. Opioids that are currently available to me are tramadol, codeine, heroin and methadone. First one is pretty shitty, last two ones I'd leave alone for a while, ..

***TLDR:*** .. So my question is: how nauseous codeine is, compared to tramadol?

Or is there any way to deal with nausea? Or maybe it goes away when some experience comes, like with alcohol? Anything?

What is Solubility? Solubility is the property of a solid, liquid, or gaseous chemical substance called solute to dissolve in a solid, liquid, or gaseous solvent. 

Human cells membranes are made up of mostly fats called phospholipids and they have holes call aquaporins in them that let water pass freely. So that means basically all fat and water soluble drug molecules can absorb all over the body, through various epithelial tissue. 

Below is a nice write up about the specific differences on the two classes of drugs and how they manifest in the body, and a clinical study at the bottom where they reviewed 45 difference studies to determine the bioavailability of opioids, benzodiazepines, and antimigraine drugs delivered intranasally.

TLDR: Drugs absorb through your nose, stop using words you don't understand to say they dont. 


First here is a nice explanation of the difference in water vs fat soluble drugs:
>Drug Distribution
By Jennifer Le, PharmD, MAS, BCPS-ID, Professor of Clinical Pharmacy and Director of Experiential Education in Los Angeles, Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego.

Source:
http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/drugs/administration-and-kinetics-of-drugs/drug-distribution

>>After a drug is absorbed into the bloodstream (see Drug Absorption), it rapidly circulates through the body. The average circulation time of blood is 1 minute. As the blood recirculates, the drug moves from the bloodstream into the body’s tissues.

Once absorbed, most drugs do not spread evenly throughout the body. Drugs that dissolve in water (water-soluble drugs), such as the antihypertensive drug atenolol, tend to stay within the blood and the fluid that surrounds cells (interstitial space). Drugs that dissolve in fat (fat-soluble drugs), such as the antianxiety drug clorazepate, tend to concentrate in fatty tissues. Other drugs concentrate mainly in only one small part of the body (for example, iodine concentrates mainly in the thyroid gland) because the tissues there have a special attraction for (affinity) and ability to retain that drug.

Drugs penetrate different tissues at different speeds, depending on the drug’s ability to cross membranes. For example, the antibiotic rifampin, a highly fat-soluble drug, rapidly enters the brain, but the antibiotic penicillin, a water-soluble drug, does not. In general, fat-soluble drugs can cross cell membranes more quickly than water-soluble drugs can. For some drugs, transport mechanisms aid movement into or out of the tissues.

Some drugs leave the bloodstream very slowly because they bind tightly to proteins circulating in the blood. Others quickly leave the bloodstream and enter other tissues because they are less tightly bound to blood proteins. Some or virtually all molecules of a drug in the blood may be bound to blood proteins. The protein-bound part is generally inactive. As unbound drug is distributed to tissues and its level in the bloodstream decreases, blood proteins gradually release the drug bound to them. Thus, the bound drug in the bloodstream may act as a reservoir for the drug.

Some drugs accumulate in certain tissues (for example, digoxin accumulates in heart and skeletal muscles), which can also act as reservoirs of extra drug. These tissues slowly release the drug into the bloodstream, keeping blood levels of the drug from decreasing rapidly and thereby prolonging the effect of the drug. Some drugs, such as those that accumulate in fatty tissues, leave the tissues so slowly that they circulate in the bloodstream for days after a person has stopped taking the drug.

Distribution of a drug may also vary from person to person. For instance, obese people may store large amounts of fat-soluble drugs, whereas very thin people may store relatively little. Older people, even when thin, may store large amounts of fat-soluble drugs because the proportion of body fat increases with age.


A review of the clinical pharmacokinetics of opioids, benzodiazepines, and antimigraine drugs delivered intranasally.

Abstract
Background: Interest in the development of drugdelivery devices that might improve treatment compliance is growing. A dosage formulation that is easy to use, such as intranasal application with transmucosal absorption, may offer advantages compared with other routes of drug delivery. The literature concerning intranasal application is diffuse, with a large number of published studies on this topic. Some cerebroactive pharmaceuticals delivered intranasally might follow the pathway from the nose to the systemic circulation to the brain. To determine the suitability of these drugs for intranasal drug delivery, a systematic review was performed.
Objective: The aim of this review was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties of intranasal, intravenous, and oral formulations in 3 classes of cerebroactive drugs that might be suitable for intranasal delivery—opioids, benzodiazepines, and antimigraine agents.
Methods: A search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (dates: 1964–April 2009) was conducted for pharmacokinetic studies of drugs that might be suitable for intranasal delivery. A comparison of pharmacokinetic data was made between these 3 routes of administration.
Results: A total of 45 studies were included in this review. Most of the opioids formulated as an intranasal spray reached a Tmax within 25 minutes. The bioavailability of intranasal opioids was high; in general, >50% compared with opioids administered intravenously. Intranasal benzodiazepines had an overall Tmax that varied from 10 to 25 minutes, and bioavailability was between 38% and 98%. Tmax for most intranasal antimigraine drugs varied from 25 to 90 minutes. Intranasal bioavailability varied from 5% to 40%.
Conclusions: This review found that intranasal administration of all 3 classes of drugs was suitable for indications of rapid delivery, and that the pharmacokinetic properties differed between the intranasal, oral, and intravenous formulations (intravenous > intranasal > oral).

Would h work as a pain killer? What is the amount I can do that will make this bearable and not ruin my life?

I have snort diladin before a few times and did not feel an addiction- this was before the recent injury for Rec. Purposes.

Any response helps, a pm, anything.

But now that I am old enough to consume the show from an adult and user's perspective, I can see how problematic some of this shit is. For example, my *biggest* pet peeve is when they start to do the backstory of the addict and they ALWAYS decide to throw in ""and at 12, (insert name) tried marijuana and alcohol for the first time."" Like... okay? So did half of my middle school???

I just find it kind of hilarious that the person being documented could literally be speedballing, smoking PCP, or even shooting bath salts, and the producers are still like ""yeah let's make sure we emphasize their descent into the drug world started with a couple hits off the joint at parties, this definitely correlates to their current, life-ruining habit and all-consuming addiction!""

lol I smoked a whole lot of weed, oil, and ate many an edible before I ever even considered popping a blue, LET ALONE smoking H. This post ain't shit but a rant so if you don't like it, you can *get out.* 

Jk, happy nods yall! :~)

TL;DR - I think it's funny and annoying that Intervention always highlights when a person first tried weed, regardless of the severity of their addiction or whether they even continue to smoke cannabis. ",1507278756.0

At first I thought it was just a drug dealer trying to get me back to giving him all my money but it seems to have gone a little further. There have been more than normal winking emojis and ""I've missed yous"" when I don't call for a few days and other shit like that. It hasn't been anything overly forward but it's a little more than subtle. 

I have nothing against what people like and how they want to live their life. But I'm just not into that. The problem is that I want to be like ""yo dude if this is what I think it is then I'm not interested"". But I've been getting very good deals, sometimes just straight up free shit and I finally have a connect that I don't have to wait on and is a one stop shop for dope, white of both variants abd bud. And it's all fire. 

So basically what I'm asking is does anyone think it's possible to tell this dude what's up without losing this quality connect? 

I'm kind of thinking there's no way keep this solid connect and I'm going to have to revert back to the dark days of waiting around hours for what was supposed to be ""10 minutes"", going to 3 different places for different substances, and having to pay full price every time.

The biggest factor is definitely the amount you've been using. Coming off a couple bags a day is WAY different then coming off a brick a day habit.  I've noticed different types of opiates can determine the length of withdrawal.  When i was in a different part of the country, all I could get were dilaudids, going cold turkey from d's sucked, but it wasn't nearly as long as coming of a solid H habit.  I swear, atleast for me, like 25% of it is mental as well.  I always get through it easier if I can stay somewhat busy, (go to work if the sickness is not terrible that day, goode movies/tv shows, ect.) Being around other people who are going through it can SUUUCK.  I have a sibling who, when she gets sick, just complains and whines about everything, I CAN NOT be around her when i'm ill.  But I've been in detoxes where everyone just kinda keeps to themselves and just deals with it.  Those kind of people are much better to be around when sick. It really helps to keep your mind occupied, and not have people around you who in one way or another constantly remind you that your going through it.  If I can some how afford it, suboxone and xans REALLY help the first few days.  Definitely makes it feel like more of a slide then a crash landing.

(Sober for 3 years just relapsed),"I first started abusing opiates when I was 16 as a sophomore in highschool. I had undergone a few surgeries due to a really serious leg injury I went through at the time and was put on a few different prescriptions. I was given 240 5/325 hydrocodones after my surgeries in 2010. I started taking them and then having this internal desire to take more and more of them. I really enjoyed the feeling. It didn't only kill my pain but got rid of my anxiety and panic attacks, made me happier and more social. I generally enjoyed being alive more than I ever did before using opiates.
I ended up going through all the hydrocodone and then within the next year after that I didn't touch anymore opiates until I developed a cystic area in my throat that had abnormal cells. I had to get another surgery at 17/18 and they removed a big section of tissue from the outer linking of my throat tissue. It made it really painful to talk, open my mouth (chewing, etc.) And I was given a 120 script of 10/325 Vicodin and then some 5/325 percs. I went home for a day and soon realized I couldn't take them because my throat was so inflammed and fucked up from the surgery. So I went back to the doctor and told him what was up and how I got a bunch pain meds but couldn't even take them because my throat was so fucked up. So he then just went and prescribed me more, but in liquid form. So I had gotten 2 full scripts of percs and Vics and then got prescribed 2 big bottles of liquid hydrocodone. This is where my real problem started.

I was using the syrup for pain at first and then very quickly started abusing it to get high. The syrup ran out and then I started using the pills and fell in love with the oxys specifically. I was taking opiates all day every day for about a solid month straight. By the end of the month my scripts were running out and I was getting ready to stop using. I didn't know anything about withdrawal or anything like that.

The day came. I ran out. Went to sleep that night and woke up the next morning dripping sweat and vomiting, dry heaving into the toilet for hours. I was too weak to stand. Etc. I was living with my gf at the time and she helped me get through all of the wds. I finally got over the wds and didn't use any opiates for about 6 months. Until I was 18. I got a good job and bought my first apartment.

I had a lot of friends at the time who were getting strung out on Heroin. I had told my friends not to bring it around me and not to use it, blah blah blah. I honestly didn't even know what heroin was, didn't know it was an opiate. Just knew that people injected it and became horrible people from it. I was living in this apartment for a couple months and the job was really intense physical labor, I started craving opiates and told my friend. My friend had a few points of dope on him and he told me that H was an opiate and that he would let me try some. He explained to me that it was the exact same thing as morphine, just slightly altered to be faster acting in your brain. He talked to me about it for a good hour or two and finally explained to me that I could snort it. I didn't have to shoot up. And that's where I caved. I said fuck yeah, I'll try it. He busted me out about 1/3 of a point and said to snort it. I did and then immediately fell in love.

After that day I was chipping at first and don't even know at what point I became fully physically dependent on it. I started using daily. Would only go to work while using. If I wasn't using I wouldn't go to work. Wouldn't visit family. Or go anywhere really. I started doing about 2/3 bags a day and very shortly after quit my job and bailed on my apartment and moved into a town house on the other side of town. I started selling bud and dope and was making a shit load of money.

I shortly after got up to using about 1 gram to 2 grams of Heroin a day. All snorted. I was using non stop all the time and had never had to go a single day without heroin for 2/3 years. I always had some on me. My dealer loved me and always knew what time to show up at my house in the morning to supply me with more. I'd get a quarter oz of heroin and 4 lbs of weed a day. My use was out of control. My house quickly turned into a trap house. Close friends started overdosing in my living room. My girlfriend of 2 years left me. I started not caring about my hygiene. Only caring about dope. Started coming up short on front money for the lbs of weed and needing more dope.

I ended up owing my weed guy like $2000 by the end of it and still just stuck to selling heroin and that was it. I couldn't afford my rent anymore and left to move in with a friend across town. He was an addict at the time and he had a big chunk of money in a bank account that his mom managed for him so she used his money and paid for his apt for him. Be let me stay there if I just got him high all the time with my H supply.

I tried Iving a couple times and never liked it. I hated it honestly. Didn't like the way it felt. It made me sick I was the only one in my group friends who stuck to snorting. I had the biggest habit out of all my friends but never started IVing. From that moment on its all just a blur. Just 2 years of copping and then withdrawals off and on, off and on, endlessly.

I finally got clean because I had no other options. Dope ran dry. Friends were dying all around me and I was the only one stuck in the middle who never OD'd from it.

I moved 300 miles away to a family members and got clean and stayed there for a year. After a year I moved back to the city again and I stayed clean. Was able to say no and genuinely didn't want to use again.

Now fast forward a couple years. Ive moved around a lot. Been clean for 3 years. Moved out of state with some family and left all of my old life behind. Left school. My pretty decent job running a restaurant on a college campus. Everything.

I moved out here, working a shitty gas station job and just kinda chilling. Getting adjusted and looking for better work. I met a beautiful girl and we hooked up and have been dating for 4 months. Things have been pretty great. Life's been good. But then the cravings started coming back. Out of no where.

Life was better for me than it ever has been since before I ever started using in the first place, and I found it hard to keep heroin off my mind. It made no sense. There was times where I was really struggling and could never ever say yes to wanting more heroin. I hated it and had no desire to do it, no matter how bad shit got.

But now that I have the most to lose, and things are going well, I caved and started buying 30mg oxys on the darknet. After about 3 purchase of oxys, I was wasting a lot of money and not getting much use since they're so expensive and don't last too long. So I decided to just get heroin. Cheaper and more efficient. So there we go. Bought .5 for the first time in 3 years off the DNM about 36 days ago. I used it over the course of 7 days. And then went through some super minor wds for about 3 days. I just got another .5 Monday. 3 weeks later after my first relapse. And im currently using now. Expecting it to last me about 7 days or so again.

It feels great, I missed it. But I honestly don't know why I'm using it. I don't even really want it. I'm not experiencing much pain. Life's really going well for me. But here I am crawling back to it again.

Why now of all times?

I would give 1 or 2 bucks to someone if they approached me at the gas station if I could afford to but I wouldn't go out of my way to give them any money if I was at a stop light, I would just leave the window up and not think much of it.

I didn't refuse to help because I think they're lazy or useless drug addicts and I certainly don't believe I'm better than anyone else. It's just so easy to lie to yourself and justify not giving a stranger my money because I might need it for something ( probably drugs) before I get paid again.

I've never lacked empathy but you guys and gals really made me understand that the few bucks I spend on things I could do without each day if I really had to can be enough to brighten the day of someone in a bad situation or simply alleviate a small amount of the stress I'm sure they must be under.

So anyway, after copping today I gave a homeless couple $20 and 2 of my precious beans as they both looked rather sick. The man that I gave the 20 to was extremely grateful but I think he was even happier to receive the beans. So he and I both want to thank all ( most) of you for helping to change my outlook as far as helping those having a tougher time than myself at the moment goes. I plan to continue doing this whenever I can afford to.

Tl;dr: This sub has changed my outlook on giving money to panhandlers and I wanted to thank everyone here for doing so.

At the age of 26 now, I have a stable job and health insurance and want to revisit getting professional treatment.

 I have chronic pain resulting from some terrible surgical complications in my mid-late teens (Spent 3+ years in-&-out of the hospital, 2 metal rods put in my chest, and daily prescription of 5x 10mg oxycodone). After getting cut off by my surgeon and flat-out denied by my PCP, I went to the darknet markets and have been able to self-medicate and regain my quality of life with 5 to 10mg oxycodone and 200-400mg tramadol per day (sometimes one, sometimes both). I have done this for 6 years now, and I'm tired of the work, the expenses, and the constant fear of losing my job or going to jail if I were to get caught by the law or a drug test. 

I want to go LEGIT, but am afraid that my history of self-use and young-age won't allow it. I just want to LEGALLY get my quality of life back... but
I have to imagine that confessing to my doctor I have been taking opiates w/o a prescription for 6 years will have me labeled as a junkie. But how can I justify getting help if it would otherwise look like I have gone without for 6 years now?

In the beginning of my recovery I was on Methadone. Methadone stopped me from using other drugs but it made me feel like a zombie so I switched to Suboxone and then eventually Subutex, which I am still taking today. Yes,I’m not doing oxy’s, Roxi’s or heroin and I’m no longer struggling to find my fix all of the time but my life has completely changed. I’m talking a full 180 degrees from what it used to be and I often find myself wondering why I am doing this whole recovery thing. 

When I was using (7 years) I had a life. I had friends that didn’t use drugs and only drank. I was in school. I had plans with friends on the weekends and I had friends to text/talk to on the phone everyday. I had my own place and I even had a healthy relationship with a guy that never did drugs and only drank. I was pretty content with my life. My only big problem was that I knew that using wasn’t going to be able to last much longer. At least I didn’t wake up every day feeling like I had no purpose. 

Fast forward to these past two and a half years of being in recovery and my life is depressing. I am anti-social. I have no one to call a friend... and I mean NO ONE. I have no job, I live with my parents, I’m not in school (didn’t even graduate college), I have no motivation and an irrational fear of change, no boyfriend obviously, and no life. Why am I doing this to myself? I have no clue.

I have been seeing a therapist since the beginning of recovery. I have seen two different therapists over the whole two and half years. I have been seeing psychiatrists since I was 14 (now 24). I’ve been on all kinds of antidepressants, stimulants, anxiety medications, etc. I am currently seeing an addiction doc./psychiatrist/GP as well as my therapist who I really like. I am on antidepressants/anxiety meds, Subutex, and Adderall for my ADHD. When I think back to my old life, I remember that I’ve always been on an antidepressant and ADHD medication and I never had a life like I do now. I hate this. I hate my life. I wish it was different.

Here's the deal. I'm prescribed 10mg norco per day. I am trying to quit the damn things but sh** happens no excuses, and I've taken much more than i should be. 

The past few days I've taken probably 20-100 mg (going back about 5 days) yesterday i took 50, today ive taken 10. 

If it adds to the equation I usually took the larger doses over the course of the day in 20mg increments. Yesterday i took 20, 20, 10 and today i took 5mg at 10:00 and 5mg at 12:00. 

Urine test possible tomorrow at 11ish, my question is: will they be able to tell the higher levels from this week, or yesterday- or will they have metabolized enough out of my system to just show up as positive? 

Also, it's just a neurologist clinic setting, i dont *think* they use any fancy screenings but i could be wrong. Of course it will show up positive in my system, which is what they want. But will it show a certain level? Or an exceedingly high amount, or will this weeks dosages have passed through me?

Also i cannot find anywhere that states how many mg of Norco equals the cutoff of 2000ng/ml.  Not sure if knowing that would help! 

Last thing! I tapered my dosages today to kind of balance it out (made sense in my head). But now im thinking, will not *enough* pop up tomorrow? Bc they usually tell me to take one 10mg pill the night before my appts.

I had a few people at my house tonight. Plenty of dope, hard, and K. There was one dude who came with one of my friends who we'll call Scar. Now if you come in my house that means I like you or sort of like you. I don't hide valuables or anything because you shouldn't steal in the first place. You would be stupid to fuck  up in here anyway. Long story short...my daughters gold chain was in the bathroom all night until Scar went in. I told my boy, who is also her Godfather and somebody you just don't want to fuck with. He said ""hospital or example?"" I opted for example because even thieves will call the cops. Now my boy starts talking about gold and you just see this dude getting scared. Here we go now...my boy loads up a fat blast of hard then puts the hot pipe on Scars neck and told him to just give it up. Well he does and starts crying about all his problems and blah blah. The pipe thing was a little harsh but now it gets funny. He made dude strip to just boxers and sneakers before getting kicked out. I wish my daughter was here because she would have fucked him up but I don't get down like this in front of her(drug wise) And whats the moral of this little diddy...?",1507379533.0

Now the solution if far less cloudy than it was originally, almost transparent. But I have no visable residue in my filter. Then was some in the bottom of the cup when the cooling was finished.

My questions are. Is this solution safe to drink with 200 mil of water? Or did I use to much?

What does having not enough water do vs havibg to much water?

Does no visable residue in the filter but a major difference in coudlyness mean the filter is still working?

So I figured this was my opportune moment to ask her for her plug's information, right?

Wrong.

Homegirl hit me with ""yeah he only sells in bulk and nobody is ever okay with giving out their number so don't even worry about him, I'm your dealer."" This same bitch literally called *herself* my middle man within the last damn week and has told me over text, ""my guy won't meet for less than 40, so if you need that I'll help you out."" So basically I've either been lied to for the last month that I've been copping tar from her, or I'm getting lied to right fucking now, OR BOTH!

I guess I shouldn't expect more, I knew this chick had her own addictions and was probably not the most trustworthy person in the world to be dealing with, but I'm not sure about establishing an ongoing relationship when she constantly shorts my fucking sack and will leave me waiting all day to pick up when she's just busy getting fucked up. And when I told her my sack was short a few days ago, she told me to calibrate my scale and that she had double checked the weight, and then today I picked up yet another ""half"" that weighed out to fucking .26.

Now that I've asked for the number, I just got ten fucking texts in a row explaining how she's trying to deal now and will help me if I'm having an issue and blah fucking blah. WELL BITCH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY FUCKING GIVE ME WHAT I PAY FOR, THEN I WOULDNT BE ASKING YOU FOR ANOTHER PLUG. And the audacity for her to act like my scale doesn't work when I bought this shit last weekend and it weighs dollars, change and my 100g weight *perfectly.*

I think I'm gonna just not respond and let the silence tell her that I'm fucking tired of getting jerked around. Any advice, other than ""call that bitch out"" considering I already have, would be appreciated.

In a couple of weeks I'll be having surgery and will be needing strong pain relief when I wake up. From what I have been told by the doctor who referred me, the commonly used painkillers where I live are morphine, fentanyl and oxycodone.

My concerns stem from the fact that I have used MDMA, cocaine, benzos, meth, LSD and have had no effect from each drug whatsoever. I had tried MDMA, coke and acid before I was on any medications and all worked fine so the meds have definitely counteracted the drugs. Even coffee doesn't do anything now.

When I talked to my psychiatrist I mentioned that my meds had blocked the dexamphetamine I used to be prescribed for ADHD (obviously didnt bring up the other stuff) and he didn't seem to know why or have any other reported cases. 

He said that the painkillers should work fine, but given that he didn't know about the dex, and the fact that these other drugs have stopped working, I'm a little concerned because this surgery will take at least a few weeks to recover from, my dad had the same one and pretty much needed the painkillers all the time to get through it.

Hopefully you guys can give me a bit of help with this. I don't use opioids recreationally so I don't have any tolerance.

when i set up my shot i use two seperate rigs. one to dole out my water and to squirt into the cap and suck up through the filter/cotton. and one to actually use on myself. i do this to prevent the rig im using to poke myself a hook or to blunt it by fishing around in the cooker and squeexing the cotton while sucking up and filtering the shot. after i filter it i take the plunger out of my injection rig and back load it.  here lies my issue. after backloading the rig i put the plunger back in and squeeze all the air bubbles out and set it down on the table to tie off and prep the area (alcohol swab, adjust light on my table etc) by the time i pick the rig up and am ready to do the deed i notice there is a small amount dribbling out of the rig. one drop at a time. this happens wether i keep no air in the rig or if i leave a space to aid in registering. this is frustrating because i know its not alot im losing but anything that is dripping out of the needle tip is an amount not going into me hahah. my question is, how the hell do i prevent this and what causes it? have any of you experienced this?

When you're heating your shot up, swirl the liquid around a bit so it covers the whole bottom of the tin, and after you toss in your cotton and draw up your shot, fold the sides of the tin in to close it, and save it for later. When you feel like you're slipping into w/d, open it up, toss in some water onto the same cotton, scrape up all the residue, and you'll have a shot that will level you out.

*Black Mirror* quickly went into my top 5 favorite tv shows ever... A thrilling 3 part series that centers around our unease about the future.  Each stand-alone episode is a suspenseful story that explores different themes of modern technology.  **9.7/10**


*Ozark* Netflix's newest crime drama has a wonderfully complex plot.  I got hooked before I even finished the first episode, the plot had me from the first scene.  Like a drug, I couldn’t help but come back for more with each episode.  Despite a few hardly noticeable plot holes (it’s not up to Breaking Bad level of suspension/disbelief) All in all it was a very enjoyable binge watch.  **9/10**


*Documentary Now!*  Each episode satirizes a different well-known documentary, sometimes with exact precision and sometimes not-so-much.   Having a super talented cast and great writing, there are parts when it can feel very much like an SNL sketch.  Every so often, these skits expose hidden talent and this show furthers its comical memorial to documentaries from the past.  *Documentary Now! is so good, it will make more interest in the docs it is satirizing but also showing respect for.  It's the kind of movie that could be shown in a high school history class.*  **9/10**


~~American Horror Story:  I’m waiting for the whole new season to come all out.~~ 

> *Animations I’ve been watching*

**Bojack Horseman**  Will Arnett voices a former tv star that’s trying to restart his dying career.  This tv show brings up some controversial topics which other shows wouldn't dare touch.  This is a cartoon about life.  So much so that, while it's hysterically funny at times, it almost seems wrong to pigeonhole it as a comedy, from the comical drama to the character development, there's no cartoon quite like it. The truth is that this frivolous cartoon about a talking horse is one of the most relatable, daring, heartbreaking, soul-shattering, uplifting shows on TV.  *It honestly doesn't get the recognition it deserves.*   **9.4/10**
 

*Big Mouth*  Brand new Netflix original,  the adult-animated comedy show that delves into the 3 teens experiences of puberty.  **8.5/10**


*F is for Family;*  Bill Burr voices the father on an adult animated show, that’s set in the 70s and follows the fuck-ups of the Murphy family.  **7.5/10**


*Trailer Park Boys;*  Funny AF always. **8.6/10**

(Other shows I'd watch if you haven't already)

Took the sub and immediately felt better, even though I wasn't really in withdrawal. Just knowing I had a bupe shield surrounding my receptors made me feel safe and secure. 

I also felt my interest in life surge. Before, I had heroin on the brain. If I wasn't day dreaming of being high I was reading this sub, or related ones, constantly. I'm an avid reader but I stopped reading. Stopped researching interests. But on the subs, the heroin thoughts disappear and suddenly I'm reading non-drug subreddits and thinking of busting out the MPC again. I feel normal. 

I've been on subs before for about two years and goddamn, I didn't realize how happy and active I was until I got off the subs. With one dose I got back most of that vivacity. 

Anyways, for anyone thinking of MAT I can't recommend it enough. Suboxone is a fucking miracle drug. Cured my depression/anxiety, totally killed cravings, no more anhedonia, and no more heroin. 

I know subs have mixed reviews. They don't work for everyone, or you don't want to be dependent on a substance, or you get bad side effects...and if they don't work for you I am truly sorry, methadone is also awesome. Subs saved my life and made it worth living. I don't care if I have to take a substance everyday to feel normal. I do the same thing with my antidepressant. 

Subs are the future. And for anyone who wants to explain to me that subs aren't the same as being ""clean,"" I don't care. Quality of life is much more important than maintaining technical sobriety. I'll take happiness and subs over white knuckle meetings, always at risk of that final OD relapse. 

If you're staying away from subs because of the stigma, or because you consider them ""unclean,"" or because the old fucks at your AA meeting (who have never touched an opiate) shame people on maintenance, I urge you to reconsider. I can't believe that I regularly see opiate addicts talking shit about suboxone being ""just another addiction."" Ridiculous!

*I’m a hound over in Crippling Alcoholism.  This was originally posted there while I was blacked out.  And while I’m not a member of the tribe here, I’m good friends with /u/FashionablyFake and I would never have told the story without her approval.  She recommended I post this here because it’s directly related to a good friend of ours…*

I closed the bar. Have had 3-4 hours sleep each over the last 3 nights. I saved a teacher friend last night from a bar fight – he’s fucking 42. Tonight a rando guy literally fell out of the bathroom and faceplanted into a subsequent pool of blood on the barroom floor. My friend relayed to me his first experience as a bartender – inner city. Dude had a seizure – he has one directive.

Get the dude who had a seizure to pay his bar tab of $80.

The bartender tonight took ages to get an ice pack for the lad that busted his nose. Manage your load or be “that guy.”

Why do we “gatekeep” in CA? Because “that guy” is everywhere. Many times have we been “that guy.” All of us who are ~~crippled alcoholics~~ opiate users. We seem to take it a bit farther. We lose our kids. We are homeless. We have comorbid issues. We see the darkest in the dawn. It’s what makes us, “us.”

We are addicts.

Wanna play here? Wanna “fit in” – admit it. You, like me, are an addict. And to truly be crippled?  You’ve lost shit. Valuable shit.  Shit /drunk and the norms take for granted.

So I was inspired by the story by /u/Dr_zevon and our interaction after loomy left us.

There’s a lot of shit here in ~~CA~~ these subs. The friendships here run in currents I often forget. Many people have only this as our only place to find friendship. And a percentage of this population WILL see the darkest of the dark. Many saw my experiences. My story isn’t unique. I’m just another alcoholic.

We are addicts.

“OK Lem – why the long bullshit story that goes nowhere? Again.”

Because – we are addicts.

Addiction is not cool. Addiction is not beautiful. Addiction is pain. Addiction will kill us. The loomy story is dark as fuck.  *Note: loomy is a CA friend who OD’d in May* Guess what – they all are.

I tell this story second hand. Another ~~CA~~ Redditor and I debated ever telling this story. Like an acid it eats us daily. It’s what addiction is. Where this road of happy leads…

I love /u/TimBF

Tim helped me when no one could or would. Tim bonded hard. Like so many of us? Tim wanted nothing more than to be loved as deeply as he expressed his love. Tim was an awesome human being. Tim was a force for good. Tim was a pillar not only in CA but also in /r/opiates – yeah, so many of us have co-morbid issues.

We lost touch with Tim. So many questions. Tim doesn’t just “go away.” Was it something I said? Did I upset him? Like any drunk – he’s hard to love. But I cannot not love him. Tim understands my pain – shares it. Like me? Tim wants nothing more than to not hurt.

We are addicts.

So a quick note to everyone who wonders if “I ~~drink~~ use too much?” To the Ricky who makes another depression based post? Noise?

This is a god damned support group that won’t admit it. We get it. This place is fucking dark. The pain is astronomical. We make one another laugh because the stark reality is crushing. I mean look at the posts from the last months?!

So I tell this to not only tell you borderline asshat’s to get out now, but also to honor my friend. Someone I and many others loved. TimBF’s story is unremarkable but so important.

We are addicts.

On the surface You, me, them, Tim – we all have a veneer of our lie. We manage our reality. We don’t think our boss knows. Our wife, our kids. Parents. Neighbors. The veneer. We may even keep it here in ~~CA~~ /Opis – “everything is fine.” Hell – it’s our manta – isn’t it? EVERYTHING IS FINE!!! I SAID…

Addiction is dark. I’ve been typing to avoid this story.

You think you’re above this? That it will end any differently?? IT WON’T.

Tim had a few loves. Tim loved CA. Tim loved Opiates. Tim loved several of us that knew him well. Tim loved his Father. Tim loved his Sister. Tim loved Willie, his pug. Tim loved the Blue Jays. Tim made promises to himself he would never break.

We are addicts.

Tim died of an overdose on May 31th, 2017.

“OK Lem, whatever – a good guy died of an OD and was a drunk , you dramatic fuck…”

Tim neglected his life. Tim was on his way to be evicted. Tim had been using his Father’s drugs. His most beloved friend, his dog Willie the pug? Willie was very sick. His Father, already sick, had deteriorated and was close to death from neglect. Tim was out of work for half a year. We, the addicts who loved him had no idea how to help. Addicts hurt EVERYONE. Tim was in crisis. Tim died.

Tim owed dealers lots of money when he passed.  He’d been seriously beaten within a few days earlier.  No one knew.

Tim was beautiful. Tim is us. We are addicts. Nothing about this is beautiful but you.

His family never knew – the veneer. His Father thought he fell asleep as he collapsed from his shot. Surrounded by 100’s of empty beer cans. That beautiful son of a bitch’s story was over. Never again could we “make it up” or “think he’s ok.” We can only remember. As best we can.

We are addicts.

His Father and dog almost lost their lives. Literally. We hurt those closest to us. We hurt ourselves. And sometimes we get to laugh.

~~CA~~ Opis is one of those places. ~~CA~~ Opis is a happy place for so many of us. A literal island in our mystery of thought. A place we can forget that…

We are addicts.

It’s a dark path. Brace yourself. It will hurt. It will hurt your loved ones. It will hurt people you’ve never met. It will destroy you to people you would have met. It’s the most important thing in the world to us. We all joke about wanting to die? We do. And if we do it right? It’s fucking awful. It’s not a “story.”  It’s fucking reality.

So hey ~~CA~~ Opis? Let’s drink to not leaving this story behind, but know we will, and hope for escape. Because this shit is hilarious, but its never fun. We’re real people.

We are addicts.

I miss you Tim. I’ll always love you and never mean to disparage you – I just needed to not let this tale fester and eat me anymore. People should understand. Your story isn’t unique. Mine certainly isn’t. No one here is special. But you have people who fucking care. People who understand. You are so sorely missed. Love you bud.

We are addicts.

In that? In that we’ll never be divided. But people and things will always be taken from us. So raise a glass and cheer (or grab your DoC). We are the architects of our own demise.

We need one another because there comes a day our voices get snuffed out. Until then? Let’s have no veneer. The best I’ve ever met are this lot. And even our stories end darkly.

My last dose was about 17 hours ago and I feel like shit. I managed to get off the dope for about a week but I was still eating a couple Xanax bars a day, smoking crack, and drinking a liter of whiskey a night.

I've been using a plethora of drugs daily since I was 15, with a few short stints of sobriety when I was 16 and 18 stuck in treatment. My 24th birthday is in a week and I don't even know who I am. I've got a great job making about 60k a year, a townhouse, new car, and yet I feel like an empty shell. The last time I remember being happy is when I was dating the love of my life whom I got clean for as she was straight edge, just to throw it all away to get high. That was nearly 6 years ago now. I've battled with suicidal depression for about 9 years now and it's starting to take over again.

I've got my withdrawl kit stocked with about 30 bars of Xanax, a few Valium, 3000mg Gabapentin, a ton of Imodium, Somas, Tylenol, and Nyquil. It's 11:30am and I still haven't made it out of bed despite a bar and a half of Xanax and some Imodium. 

 Laying here stuck in my head I can only think of getting more dope and being content with life or grabbing one of my guns and swallowing a bullet to turn it off. The only thing keeping me from doing so is my mom. She's never given up on me no matter how bad I was fucking up my life, no matter how many relapses or just years of daily use. When I was a 17 year old meth head I was the worst son any parent could have and yet no matter how many terrible things I did, she never gave up on trying to help me. 

A couple months ago when I told her I was trying to kick heroin and crack and it broke her heart. She thought I had only used it for a couple weeks (didn't mention the crack, Xanax, or excessive drinking going on too) and wanted me to move back home. I told her I wanted to try and kick it on my own and I'd give it a couple weeks to see how it went. She told me she was flying out in just over two weeks to check on me. Before she made it out here I was back to a half gram of heroin a day on top of everything else.

I guess I don't really have a point to what I'm trying to get at here, sometimes the only thing that helps me cope is to write. I'm going to try to get up and shower and maybe head to the mountains for some fresh air.

Anybody wanna shoot the shit for a whole? Just got high for the first time in around a month, and attempts prior to that were pretty underwhelming due to vivitrol. That medicine is evil if you're forced into getting it or don't truly want to be 100% clean. It petty much made me seriously bconsider blow my my head off with a shotgun everyday for the first 2-3 weeks. Not funny, but lmao looking back bc I can't imagine even being that sad, especially rn cus I'm lit as a mofucka.

So what's up with y'all on this beautiful Friday?

Also have a question on how to approach a situation. Kid in my IOP asked me what he should do earlier in he week bc a friend asked him to split some shit and get high. I told how quick shit can get dicey and I didn't want to ruin our friendship cus I actually liked him - cool dude - but I def want to get high w him lol. He made sure we were hangin tn, and I think he may have some of his own stash anyway. How do I go about letting him know I'm cool with it while saying I don't want to ruin being friends? Also it'll be a little suspicious if we both fail out UA the same days hung out that weekend. I'm a straight guy btw, so it ain't like that at all.

Feel free to give me advice or tips, or talk about whatever. I'm in a good mood td  boyos 😏.

Edit: words n grammar tho

Edit 2: update below

Didn't OD luckily but fell out cold for 2 hours or so even tho I banged the smallest fucking amount ...that naltrexone rapes tolerance boyos. Only got the shot a few times to appease family; the last was slightly over a month ago. Talk about depression - holy mother ducker I literally felt like blowing my brains out with a shotty everyday. People also talk about it helping with cravings and being a blocker. Yeah, nope to both. Cravings were easily more intense for me,5 and often, as well as it not blocking when you can jus override it. Spreading awareness anybody looking into Vivitrol. It's definitey going to be helpful if you truly want to be be clean.",1507306687.0

She told me I am encouraging the opioid epidemic by using heroin and ruining a once nice place to live. First of all, this is a wonderful place to live and I see no homeless junkies or anyone giving off that vibe EVER here so she's being dramatic about that. She yapped on about how the mayor gave speeches about the epidemic and making narcan available blah blah and I was like yeah because this is a nationwide issue, it's not just your community (I come from MA where this is a million times worse too so Im sure it's relative to me). PS her community is like the nicest in the state - the epidemic here is in the hood and rural areas where I know she doesn't live. 

Anyways I got heated because she would say shit like ""Get Clean!!!"" as if that was the magic answer. Like yooo did she just unlock the secret?!! 100 gold coins to you Ms. Snob, you've got it all figured out. Lol like no shit you fucking idiot, if it was that easy there wouldn't be an epidemic. I think I was less mad about her attacking me personally as I was about her being so fucking ignorant about addiction in general. Just a snobby fuck who has no idea what she's taking about. Or maybe I am a little offended about her hating be personally too, idk, it just happened I haven't fully figured it out. 

I did say some nasty shit back to her bc I felt like she deserved it but prly just made her views of us worse so sorry for that everyone. In response to her ""ruining a nice place to live"" I said ""oh really? Isn't this the place that went to fucking war because you cousin fuckers believed black people were subhuman?! ... if you ask me it's gotten much nicer, I think we're on an upswing😉."" Maybe shouldn't have said that lol AND DISCLAIMER: I love you southerners, you are NOT cousin fuckers I was just heated and trying to throw low blows at this dumb bitch. First time I've ever thrown that at someone and I'll try to keep it the last, I don't like perpetuating that stereotype of you nice people. 

Anyways let's wrap this novel up. I'm annoyed. But I guess I gotta let it go, comes with the junkie territory after all doesn't it? Gonna be judged and hated by ignorant people who have less compassion than we do. Oh well. ",1507306541.0

 Thank god.
But i am gonna prolly take it when i feel im peeking off the oxy and smoke a bowl. I guess i will nod? Its been so long sense i nodded. I got sum1 watching me so its kinda safe.

Woke up with bloody pillow no idea wtf happend till i looked in the mirror. I learned from that, sometimes you just need to kick your own ass or die trying. Oxy ops suck they take so long to work so u get a creeper kinda effect that in very unforgiving. But should i try this xan before taking oxy er or with it or during peek or comedown. Anyone mix xanax with oxycontin and have a method any advice hmu. Ps already took an oxy slowly coming up as i type. So taking it before oxy is already out of the question. More oxy?

The promises to our child and myself that are left unfulfilled that shows no care in his mind. The unfinished tree house in our garbage filled backyard. The days I work 10-12 hours just to come home and cook for the family and clean the house while he stays motionless on the couch. The tears on his boys eyes when he passes out and doesn't play with him like he said he would. The times he is suppose to be at work but instead at home again passing out. The times I go bed alone. What he does know is all the lies he has told. The scapegoats he has used the heartache he has caused.

By this time I was out of my parents place and had just gotten robbed for my phone, wallet, and dope. Yeah it was frustrating but we always come back, it just takes a while. Anyways my world was crumpling down before me. My parents wouldn't let me move back in. I lost my job and terminated my apartment lease. I was transient for a while. 

Luckily for me I met up with an old friend/business partner. The encounter totally caught me off guard but fuck it I was selling approx. A quay (7gs) a day. I could get China, Tar, hell I could even get Dilaudid on the regular. Despite my homelessness I was doing okay for myself. Then JoGin had me drive to their motel up north. He had custys that needed both Crystal and dark. I came prepared. 

We stopped house to house dropping off sacks for a solid 2 hours. JoGin didn't use h anymore so once I had made a profitable margin I made a .10 shot of China. At this point I was still newer to the whole shooting up thing but I made it happen. 


Then I woke up in my car. Randomly parked at a Walmart. Called up JoGin and told him I was set. We needed to go to the courthouse so I went and picked him up. Court was boring nonsense so it just blended together. Once we got back though things started to intensify. It's important that I explain that our plug ""Guamtemalla"", JoGin, and I all stayed in the same room. My plug g(well call him g for convenience) ALWAYS had a gun, and an oz of each on him. This always brought concerns when we were out driving. Well this time we didn't even make it to the car.


As we hauled 2 bellhop carts full of luggage to my small sedan, this cold silence loomed over us. I opened my trunk and was instantly met with 4 ATF Federal Agents aiming AR15S directly at me. The group was about 10 strong including some police officers, but mostly ATF and the Postal Inspector. We knew instantly why they were here. G had gotten us caught up in Raids around 4-5 times but because of his mother's$ he always avoided Indictment. Well not this time :'(. My boy got searched, had his weapon seized and his drugs were given to us. The ATF apparently didn't give a fuck about drugs but all I could think about was g. He was being indicted on the spot (he's still @ FCI Englewood now. Poor guy). Turns out g had been stealing mail and working with the shadier pisas and primos. Which caught up to us. JoGin and I weren't charged and were able to keep our paraphernalia, but our reliable plug was gone for good. 


Since this day I've seen him a few times but I try to avoid prisons like the plague. He's looking at 16 years for making a deal with the feds to Indict the snitch from his Discovery. So maybe that sentence decreases or maybe not but I'm glad his ex GF is in prison and unable to snitch on anyone else. It always broke my heart to see how cutthroat the game is. Stay safe out there

I'm a 29 year old opiate junkie, who's been a 14 year old opiate junkie (minus the needle which I didn't see til I was in college),a kid who only tried opiates one time, maybe at age 11 (when prescribed: x2 6oz.Notuss(hydro/ephed mix. I believe it was synthed by the devil himself with me in mind, as he branded it ""Trojan Horse"" from age 11 to 22)) for purely innocent and legal reasons (originally). I only tried opiates once, its just lasted 18 years. All this to say from the bottom of my heart of a true  og certified junkie, whether on here or other forums past, this online community has been a beautiful gem of my haggard and tattered soul for a very large portion of my life. Thank you. I love you. 
     Why am i actually creating a username and posting text tonight?  Well, in a nutshell, after all but losing my best friend to him being skiddish of my needle habit and things just getting too crazy,  I've finally got him back. 7 months ago i got arrested in a big city an hour and half from home (rural south isn't the word,one red light in the whole county [which had 4 cities]), and spent 7 months locked up in big city with pyramid, somehow, even tho I had used a couple times when first got there, I no longer had a desire for opiates, or the life that went with them.  I was locked up with more heads and more drugs in that jail than my home county had, and I didn't want any more, not anymore.  
    So I get out, something in me different tho I can't place it, I get out of my apartment drug dealing place, go back to my southern Baptist mom and dad who haven't even let me on their property in years but are now starting to believe in me tho cautiously and with piss tests. They are now are letting me stay with them and driving me to work til I get a car, my best friend who hasnt been in my life for about a year talks to me everyday and we chill every weekend. He's been supportive, letting me crash with him and loaning me money for a cell phone, buying my food and work clothes, and he got me a legit job working like 55-65 hours a week, which is too many, but feels good to actually make $3,ooo a month legitimately. Hard work but I'm doing it. I've been so good. 
     Yet tonight, we saw an old buddy at Dollar General one who just a few years ago could blow my mind with chemistry / synth skills, and i never could picture leaving the dark side. But there he was holding his kids, and he looked really good. Gained weight, just like I had, it became do or die only he was gonna lose his kids, and he did it. Ive found when its sink or swim time for many of us, some people can and do actually swim. He says he's done with 3, both synthesizing and using it, and clearly he was, but he hands me a tec when leaving. I told my best bud, he would-be known anyway, as he too was in the checkout at dg with me. What I hate about myself is, I went back to his house, shaved a piece off, nodded hard, had to lay down,  and when he asked I lied and said no, it must've been the weed or something.  Then I started puking. Puking hard.  He walked up (hes a Tec addict whose been clean himself about a month or two so he instantly knew what he wad seeing), he busted out laughing so hard at me, and said, ""you didn't have to lie to me brother, its ok"" ......  now this is when I really felt like puking. This is what makes me hate my choice of demons, the fact that I lied to him after everything he's done for me, and he knew anyway, and is still there. I can't stand shame, and coming off the high of being clean since June, job, going to work, making money, not spending it on opiates, being hugely proud lately, I feel so ashamed at myself tonight.  My friend deserved better. The most stupid part, I didn't enjoy the tec, that feeling I literally died without is now a feeling unwanted and unpleasant to me, and id like to know more about what happened?  
    What happened to break the chains and cut the opiate junkie locks that I was tied to for more of my life than not? 
     Query 2: What should I do or say to my support group, which is my best friend who has went above and beyond only to have me lie to him tonight about slipping and sniffing a piece of Tec?  Why the hell did I lie?  I didn't shoot it, im not going to, im done with it, didn't feel good like or used to anyway. I knew he would still be there for me, what was I thinking?  
      I guess this is rant/advice seeking and offering with a splash of encouragement to all you guys. But I must BE AWARE, AS I HAD LET MY GUARD DOWN, FOR EVEN AS WE  WERE CELEBRATING THE OLD ME BEING DEAD AND GONE, THE JUNKIE STILL LIVED ON.. Sorry. (Longest shitpost rant ever). Love y'all..

I bring good news from the Frontline. Today marks my 3rd week being sober from everything. As crazy as it is to imagine that for the 1st time in 3 years I've gone more than 2 days without heroin. That's astonishing to me, but with each day I grow stronger and more invested in that number. I feel like a human again and we may not want to make the change but for all of us that have been thru the worst part and survived....trust me it's worth the withdrawals and depression. Everything we put up with is all in our head. 

Well anyways love you guys and be safe.

I know this is 1,000mg over the max 24 amount for adults, I also understand it takes up to 72hrs to notice damage if it's occurred...however as I understand it damage takes place from a buildup of a toxin that occurs from Tylenol being metabolized. I have the fastest metabolism of anyone I know , could this lessen my damage ?

I've done this before, even for 3-4 days in a row at my worst. Only thing I ever felt was some slight nausea. I know this is dumb I'm just in a lot of pain. Finding someone to trade me blues for the norcos bc I enjoy living too much to go out like an idiot.

My buddy works at a lab and I'm having him do a liver enzyme test on my blood so that I'm not flagged as a drug abuser from my doctor.

I'd do a CWE but my roomTes would wonder WTF that shit in the freezer is haha.

I suffer from anxiety and I should've known that googling this would be a bad idea. ""You're gonna die, you're gonna die"" :0. I'm a bit worried, I know it's not safe...

Ahhh the struggles of being opiate tolerant and in chronic pain In a country that would rather push toxins than safe, effective pain relief. (Can we agree that the only reason APAP is even added to hydros is to deter high seekers? Tylenol had never done anything for my pain , and is definitely negligible in it's pain relief power compared to even 10mg of hydro)

Been a daily reader of this subreddit for about a year and finally have to post my life situation and the story of how I got here. I hope by reading this some people will be affected in a good way.

I am 28 years old. Grew up in a very standard middle class family, and had a very happy childhood, my parents have been married for over 30 years and have never had any sort of argument. I did no drugs or drinking until I got to college. During my freshman year is where I started drinking and partying a lot while also making sure I never missed class and got my homework done. It was also then that I started doing ""drugs"". Once I found weed I was convinced that I had become a new person and everything I learned about drugs growing up was absolutely false. From there I tried all the other stuff... coke, Molly, k2, salvia and all tbat good stuff. 

I graduated college in 4 years and got my bachelor's degree and just found an amazing girlfriend and got started in my first serious relationship. She was perfect, everything I've been looking for my whole life, I thought I was lining up everything in my life perfectly. Stopped smoking weed, basically stopped drinking and partying, stopped going to casinos with my friends and spending all my time with her. After 10 months of dating, I found out she had been cheating on me and it absolutely CRUSHED me. That's when my life would completely change forever... That's when I tried my first pill...

My buddy saw how depressed I was and how down I was on the world. He unknowingly is about to change my life. The first time I tried a hydro10 I found my new love. I found everything that I wanted in a small pill. It made me forget how shitty everything was and it took care of me.

Now, I didn't start doing them everyday, I was very weary of prescription medication and controlled myself pretty good. That didn't last long. Once I was 23 I was doing pills everyday. The only thing I could get was hydro 10s and I basically had an unlimited supply of them from a person. I had saved up a ton of money by working and being very smart with my paychecks. Once I became a daily user, my self control went completely out the window. I had realized that I was a full blown addict. I drained all my bank accounts, starting ""borrowing"" money from my parents and friends, but that wasn't enough... I lost all control and starting stealing from my job.

I stole 4800 from my employer, was obviously caught, and was on the verge of driving my car off a cliff. I called my parents, told them everything and was blatantly honest with them. My parents, who loves me more than anything in the world, were completely stunned and disappointed. My dad drive 3 hours down to where I lived in my college town, repaid my company the 4800 dollars, and took me back to go live with them. 

Once I got back to be living with my parents, I was now viewed by everyone I know as a drug addicted list. It killed me on the inside, and for the next few months I spent all my time in my bedroom being depressed about the world and embarrassed at the person I've became. Since I moved back to my hometown I had 0 connections to drugs and did my withdrawing alone and I'm my bed and got clean. Great right! I'm starting to get my life back on track, rebuilding relationships, getting a great paying job, and getting a new girlfriend. Things are great now that I'm 26. I have everything in order!! What could possibly go wrong!?!?!

Well, as we all are aware... Once your an addict you're always an addict. I had happen to run in to an old friend from college where me and him use to party pretty hard. I went to a baseball game with him and while we were tailgating, he busted out some of these blue pills. Now, he has no clue that I had a problem with pills before, this is going to turn out to be the new worst day of my life. I, clean and sober, decided I was going to try one of these oxy  30s... i mean there's no way I can let my life spiral and go to hell again right? Wrong. I was hooked... again... fuck... 

To keep this not as terrifying long as it could be I'll sum up the next 2 years of my life. Opiates. I made the switch from blues to H. The day I first tried tar is the day my life is officially over. Went from somehow spending at least 120 a day on 30s, to starting to only spend 80 a day on H. Yeah, shit spiraled and now am currently spending at least 160 a day on H. Getting money by ANY MEANS NECESSARY. 

I have officially made it know to everyone in my life AGAIN that I am a drug addict again. My girlfriend who I live it, is the nicest sweetest person I've ever met. She has helped me so much. But I have lied to her nonstop for 2 fucking years. She has given me so much money to buy B it's pathetic. She has had no idea that's that where her money to ""pay my phone bill... etc excuses"" has gone to. I've came clean to her about everything. Here's my current life situation: I have a job, but who know for how much longer with all the days I take off sick and withdrawing. I owe 2 separate dealers over 400 a piece, who are making threats against me. My parents no longer trust me and barely consider me their son. I've lost every friend I have due to borrowing money and not paying it back. As of an hour ago I went out to my car to cry/ look for tar crumbs and cutting open my straws to look for residue to get at least one puff off the foil.

I've been on the phone all day with treatment centers, which has been a slight nightmare. I had no idea how complicated treatment facilities make it with all their rules and stuff. Anyways, I found a place that I can go to detox/ get help. This will be my first time going to something like this. I am scared, nervous, excited, and frightened. I have such an addicting personality and I'm scared I won't make it and am scared I will go back to using. I need to make this happen. For me, my girlfriend, my family, everyone I know. Sorry for the long post but it feels good to get this off my chest. I hope I can make it through treatment, and anyone who is reading this who is just starting out... STOP right now. Please don't end up like me. Be good bropiates and I hope everyone is having a great Saturday night and hope everyone is comfortable with their lives and much love to everyone who reads this post",1507423363.0

I just wanted to say that I've been feeling kinda depressed after my last relapse, and though Im not craving super hard or anything it has been rather debilitating. I'm gonna chock it up to PAWS or some underlying depression which has been off and on for me most of my adult life. 

I have some friends, a couple really solid ones, mostly just acquaintances and people I know through college. I have good family support and Ive been seeing this girl recently too. But none of them get it. All the experience they have with drug abuse/dependency is peripheral at best. I mean the girl likes to get down and party but she is definitely a normie. 
Im not feeling super spiritual these days(constantly waver between agnosticism and atheism) and I do not attend any 12 step meetings or any real channel for my drug/addiction related struggles or concerns. 

You guys are all I got, r/opiatesrecovery is a little too stern for my liking. So for that I thank you all, whether it be making me drool with your dope porn, or breaking down any notion I have that I could one day use opiates responsibly, to even the day to day gritty shit like copping threads and other bullshit/medical issues/robbed type threads. anyways I just feel as though I can be myself around here and not get judged or trolled(ok maybe, heres to you /u/oldirtyburton).

My addiction had taken over and escalated to the point of taking about 130 pills a day.

I've been an IV heroin addict since I was 19 which is seven years ago. After discovering loperamide to help alleviate withdrawal symptoms, I became addicted to it. My addiction slowly progressed to the point of me taking 130 pills a day. In the ICU, I was close to death. I was told my heart quit beating for over two minutes and the doctor told me it was a miracle I didn't die or have brain damage.

Fast forward two years and I've been out of treatment for about two months. I started taking loperamide again here and there after my obsession for opiates became too much. I'm now taking 96 pills every couple of days and I can already feel the effects it's having on my heart. I wake up with chest pains and can feel my heart palpitating every so often. What the fuck is wrong with me?? How do I stop this? Now I've reached a point where if I go more than two days without lope I am in horrible withdrawals.

I didn't expect that and was bummed out by that. I read that your body ""remembers"" being addicted and fucks you hard when you only relapse for a short period. Thanks, body.

However - I binged HARD on those 0.5g without tolerance for 2 days, basically high 24/7 for those 2 days. What would happen if I only did like one dose - would I still be in withdrawal? I need experience reports, bros.

I probably won't do opiates again, but I just thought of that fucked up withdrawal again and felt like asking this.

The hows and whys.,"I am a heroin addict who has been completely sober for over almost 8 months. I'd like to talk about how drug addiction has affected me, what got me clean, and why I still come to this sub.

Around 2012 I was spending time with a friend of mine who I enjoyed getting high with. At this time in my life I was at the tail end of a rather extended and enjoyable addiction to prescription painkillers. We got on the subject of people posting pictures of their drug stashes to the internet, my friend said ""check this site out"" and fired up /r/opiates in his browser. This was my next foray into an addiction I never knew existed. From that day forward I was a daily user of Reddit. 

What I noticed about this website, and this sub specifically, were that almost all walks of internet personality were well represented. Die hard text book drug nerds who understood why these drugs were so enjoyable, seasoned veterans dropping wisdom on the new users or community in general, trolls or people with a stick up their ass I assume were either in the midst of withdrawal or perhaps one of those never satisfied with anything types, and casual users busting it up about their daily lives. I loved this sub. 

I'll keep the rest of this as short as possible because this message is for everyone but I'm trying to reach those who feel like they'll never be able to live their lives without drugs. My final run ended in February of this year (2017). I'd turned once in a while snorting heroin into shooting again and eventual full blown addiction. The weeks leading up to this day were like any other starting around April of 2016. I would work my manual labor job, buy enough Heroin to do some in the morning and when I got home from work. From April 2016 until around September this was my MO. I'd wake up around 4:15AM, snort 2 bags, drink coffee and listen to music until 6:30 when I had to leave for work. I loved this routine. I was still saving money because I was buying enough Heroin to keep me going and it wasn't enough of my income to be completely broke by the end of the week. This would change eventually.

Around late August although I maintain I was able to do my job well, the people at work who had gotten to know me when I was completely clean noticed the change. I looked terrible physically, I was always tired, incredibly moody, barely ate. I was the spry, hard worker with focus I once was. I was let go from my job. This left me in quite a predicament. I was let go on a Friday and used the money I got that day for working the previous week to buy as much Heroin as I could. I still had a good amount at home (about 5 or 6 days worth) but I knew I would be useless without it and had to find more work to get another check before that ran out. After buying more Heroin I'd figured I had about 19 days worth which lasted 10 days. The combination of being angry from losing my job, lack of daily responsibility, and hopelessness knowing I wanted to stop but couldn't basically hardwired me to run through the stash as quickly as possible.

The industry I'm in I've made a lot of contacts with. I'm very employable, tons of experience, my own car, valid license, I look like a promising prospect as long as nobody knew about my drug addiction. I ended up putting ads on Craigslist for my people in my industry, and finding work that way. This got me from August until around December or so. I was actually making more money working this way, but being honest my heart wasn't in it. I just wanted to buy more Heroin. I lost my car in November (irreparable motor damage) of 2016 and now had to take the train to get to my Heroin supplier(s).

I'm from an area on the east coast with a very famous Heroin scene. It was just my luck that both my suppliers lived within a 5 minute walk of the train station. My routine at this point was take the train to work, get cash at the end of the day (get back to the main station around 5:30PM) take another train to my dealer's house (adding about another 2 hours), then taking the train home. Essentially I'd leave my house around 5:15AM and not return until maybe 10 at night. Every weekday and most Saturdays. I'd dip out on the train being so fatigued from work and lack of sleep and just picking up. I couldn't imagine my life at this point without getting high. Every part of my day was focused on being high on Heroin. I decided around early December to start shooting (again).

From December until I went to rehab my life was just insanely bad. I stopped getting my haircut, stopped shaving, stopped showering daily months before. Other than having a place to sleep every night I was beginning to look, act, smell, and feel like every homeless junky you've ever seen in your life. I was suicidal at times but I just kept telling myself through those dark and endless days filled with ever present desperation that I was fucked up on drugs and really didn't feel that way. This was simply a very convincing illusion I'd created through hard core drug abuse. The situation came to a head with my homelife around February. It was a Friday I'll never forget. After months of speculation, lying, denial, arguments, thievery, and general scumbag behavior I finally admitted to my family I was a drug addict and that I needed help.

Rehab was a welcome change in my life. I needed to get away. I needed to not work, I needed to not have money in my hand, I needed to get out of that fucking room I'd spent so much time feeling lousy and shooting Heroin wondering when it was all going to end. I can't explain in words how relieving and freeing the feeling was of finally knowing it was all over. That everyone knew I was a junky fuck up and I was stowed away safely at a rehab. At the rehab I feel I rather correctly made the choice that just getting clean and going back to my normal life was not going to keep me straight. I didn't want to go home so I made the choice to move to a half way house. I would stay at that half way house and eventually move onto another type of facility that basically just wasn't home which is all I cared about. I got into a 12 step program and I'm realizing at this point in my life that I can't just smoke pot or drink socially or pop pills on occasion. It's all or nothing and if I want to stay off Heroin it's in my best interest to be completely sober. Is it really that bad? I don't think so. When you're getting high all the time and have years of your life where you'd been getting high it's almost impossible to imagine your life without anything, ever again. 

I feel like this is the right move. It's been almost 8 months and since April of this year I've had a car, I've had money, I've been working, and I haven't gotten high. The idea pops into my head sometimes, especially on this surprise rainy day that I don't have work. Today would be the day. Life's going well, plenty of cash, friends and family back in my life. Life's going well, better fuck it up again by getting high. I don't want to drink socially, I don't want to smoke pot or eat edibles, I don't want to take E and go to a rave, I want to shoot Heroin. That's all my drug use has reduced me to. I enjoy my life today, and I'm looking forward to moving further and further away from those dark days spent sticking needles in my arm wondering what tomorrow was going to bring.

Super freaked out by possible repercussions cause paramedics, fire dept, and police showed up. What to expect?","Hey guys.

Thanks for reading.

Okay, so, clearly not a great night for me. I have been clean for the past 8 months, and 2 days ago my boyfriend and I got into an argument, I got drunk and stupid, and went and picked up. Made the plan that I was only gonna use until the end of that sack. He knew all about it and we made amends and everything was chill on that front except for the fact that I was using, which frankly I didn't really like either overall. It was nice to have a little vaycay back to the dark side tho, I will give it that.

Anyways, tonight was BF's birthday. We have a great day, play football on the beach, get burgers, go to the bar with friends,  then come home (to our brand new and AWESOME apt that we just got rented to us despite all odds lol, which I mention because I think it's relevant in what could be at stake here if I've fucked it all up).

Sorry if this is rambling, I was just narcaned, it took me like 10 whole minutes to figure out whether I was sitting or the EMT who revived me was just super tall (spoiler alert: it was both) so yeah please bear with me.

Anyways let's get to the good shit. It's time for bed, I decide like, fuck this shit I'm really done with doing this, I could potentially split this shit I have left up and do some in the morning but I'd really rather get it out of the way now so I can get back on my subs (fun logic right), so I load it all up in my shot and weeeee.

The last thing I remember is leaning backwards and my bf saying ""babe, are you okay??"" And I said ""I'm fine!"" Aaaaaand then I woke up to a giant blurry blob of an EMT person towering over me telling me to ""WAKE UP"" and obviously I obliged that request so, you know. Here we are.

Anyways, my question is this:

Apparently, hella EMTs responded to my poor frantic BF's call. All were at least 8 minutes away. That would have been fine, except 3 minutes into the 911 call, I stopped breathing. A full minute passed, no breaths. Turned blue. The 911 lady made the decision that it was critical I get narcan IMMEDIATELY and called all units in the area into the house.

Just to be clear, police officers are equipped with narcan as of last year (just the nasal spray kind) cause Santa Cruz, CA is such a high risk area for opiate abuse.

So, first on the scene to show up within 4 minutes from the initial call = police officers

They talk to my bf outside for a bit, and:

~30 seconds after the police, the fire department arrives.

The police leave, saying that the fire dept is more equipped to handle it. Pretty cool. They didn't even come inside.

FD runs upstairs after talking to my bf and they apparently start setting up on me (?). This part is unclear as obviously I was unconscious and one of the FD people took my BF out in the kitchen to ""talk"" while they revive me.

Then, like minutes later, the paramedics arrive.

They narcan me. Still no fuckin idea where but apparently it was IM so, guess we'll find out soon.

I wake up out of what I can only describe as a legit dream sequence/hallucination scene in a movie. First I heard ""WAKE UP, littleloopyo, WAKE UP."" Then the towering black blob was saying it. Then all of a sudden it was my boyfriend saying it (???) like the blob morphed into him and his body, then it morphed into a lady paramedic, and then all of a sudden it morphed into not only the giant lady paramedic, but also like 12 other EMTs standing around me, most of them digging through my purse and pulling up any prescription bottles they could find and looking through them. 

There's nothing in there but Subs, but still. They took them all out and left them in a little row on the dresser.

Asked a bunch of questions about my boyfriend, because he's diabetic, so there is a big box of needles right underneath the shelves next to the bed. So that looks bad. Especially considering why they were there in the first place. Obviously. So. My question is. 

Are we like a marked house now? What sort of repercussions can I expect from this kind of incident? We just moved into this new place, I'm up for a new job and it's a really small town and the field that I work in is even more of a niche. Should I be worrying about our livelihood at this point? Did I put it all at stake? Are the police gonna be like a knock knock knockin at or door like we're major drug users in the neighborhood or something? Especially with such a nice apartment it's like, I don't know I'm really not trying to brag (lol especially considering it's just cause it has a dishwasher so, height of luxury, obviously) but it is for the neighborhood, are the PD gonna put some note on our address being like ""worst drug dealers in the history of ever since they clearly dip into their own stash, but they have a dishwasher so, that kind of luxury is suspicious please watch em""???

Lol basically I'm just tripping about how 3 different departments and at least a dozen officers were at my apartment tonight. The EMTs and the FD went through my purse and wrote down all of the ""drugs"" I have (all subs, plus some antibiotics cause I have a sinus infection) and it just makes me worry.

That was a really private thing I just went through and it feels like the entire like community was present to witness it. I literally came to with about 8 people standing over me. Not even including giant EMT lady. The idea that this WOULDNT come back to bite me in the ass sounds really far fetched right now. And I would love some advice!!

I have chronic pain and I'm doing detox from my hydrocodone. My last dose was about 30mg about 96 hours ago and, well, I haven't been able to sleep more than about an hour or two since I began because of the aforementioned chronic pain.

So, my question is: If I took a 5mg dose of hydrocodone to try to get at least a little sleep, would it reset my withdrawals? The WDs were INSANELY easy this time compared to the other times I've tried to take a drug holiday, I don't want to reset the physical symptoms which seem to have subsided since yesterday.

So my connect usually has premade dub bags. She sells em for around 20 a pop although she does do some nice price breaks, usually I throw in w my girl and we get around 6 for 100. Now these bags have between .1-.2 in em, but more often then not they are closer to .1. I would say for 100 we normally get .7-.85. At least. Perhaps even more. But it’s not exactly a great deal in terms of quantity. Quality wise it’s the best stuff I’ve found on the streets in my area. I’m in the south and in a state notorious for having fent and the dope that actually contains dope, is known for having extremely diluted h. This stuff is very similar to the stuff I was able to get back up north. I recently ordered off the dnm and while the quality of that shit was discernibly better than this stuff, it’s still comprable. I would this stuff a B, B+ whereas the stuff I received through the dnm was an A.



Anyway, background info aside, let’s get to the gist of this post. I was stuck at work all day today and worked a busy ass double. My feet hurt, my back hurt, I was pooped and after having one of the best and most profitable weekends in regards to work in recent memory (it’s been the off season these last few months and even tho season doesn’t start for a few more months there’s been a noticeable uptick in business. Made almost 400 bones these last few days) I was more than ready to go hit my connect, get home, snort some dope and hit the shower w my girly. 

So I’m getting off work and give her a call, my girl wants to throw in on top of my usual 6 for 100 deal. I ask chick if she’ll do 9 for 155. So 25 bones off, in other words. Even tho I literally just started going to this chick the other day/last week she has been very open to price negotiation, which is starkly different than previous dealers I’ve had both down here and throughout my life. She says sure, to head down. Highway is clear and instead of sitting in my car for 30 minutes like I normally have to whenever I cop in the middle of the day because of stupid, bullshit-ass traffic I make it down to her place in 15 minutes. She’s one street over from where I normally meet her and I roll up to her in the middle of what appears to be a mini kickback taking place in the middle of this hood at 10 o’clock at night on a Sunday. Whatever, no worries. So she comes up to the car and is on the phone and is digging around her pockets. She gets off the phone and asks the question I have been waiting to hear, “I just have a g and a half on me, it’s not bagged out do you just want that?” “Sure, absolutely, how much were you tryna get for it?” “Oh the 155 is straight.” 

Holybuttfuckyes.jpg.

Toss the cash, am handed a bag with two fatass and dense rocks in it with some pebbles and powder at the bottom. Zip home, break all the dope down and am very happy to announce that this shit is not only the same fire she’s had but it’s also the fattest bag I’ve been lucky enough to scoop off the streets down here. Compared to the fat gram I grabbed off the dnm, and compared to the grams I used to get back in my old state, this appears to be at least 1.5 if not more. I wanted to take pics of the two dense rocks but I figured I would break one down and keep one in tact then snap a pic. 


As for the price, 155 for a g and a half is cheaper then what I would pay back home, which is thee biggest dope haven/city in the middle of the east coast. I would pay 100-120 for a gram and normally 60 for a half. So this is right around, and is in fact cheaper, than those prices, obviously. The state i am in doesn’t seem big as far as being able to buy weight is concerned. Especially the particular area I’m in. As you move towards the central and northern parts of my state it seems like people, at least on here, can get actual grams, but the lowest I’ve heard is 180 and it’s usually around 200 bucks. This is one of the biggest comeups I’ve had, at least in recent memory and since I got back into the dope game a few months ago. This shit should last be a solid minute. Plan on taking a T break with Kratom after I make my way through this batch, but in the future i am def going to try and get her to sell me weight. Even if I have to pay 10-20 bucks more, it’s still way more worth it then getting individual dub bags which seemingly aren’t even weighed out and are packaged by eyeing them. Some bags are minuscule while some have .25 in em. I hate that inconsistency, as most anyone would.


Anyway y’all, this dope weekend turned into an even doper night! Awesome way to end my weekend. How were y’alls weekends? Anyone have a similar experience w a dealer tossing you way more than they normally would?

The only reason she did it is because she was at this kickback and clearly didn’t have the time to bag this shit up. She probably got the bag from her connect for like half of what I paid and figured, fuck it, a quick way to double my money. Also since first hitting her up I’ve dropped a few hundred bucks this last week so she probably sees me as a nice, and profitable new customer. There’s loads of connects and dboys down here (literally was asked, “if I party” on my way home from grabbing this bag. Which everyone knows means, “do you do dope?”. I told him nah and that I was good. Like I said, the vast majority of connects down here have shit laced heavily w fent and my friend and is tolerance is pretty fucking low. So, that or either his shit was cut to fuck garbage. I had no reason to try and grab a tester from him, had a pocket full of diesel. Plus he yelled it out across a gas station parking lot as a few other people around. Dude couldn’t have been any sketchier.) but what there’s isn’t a huge option of is connects w solid product that contains actual heroin and this good product available at a moderate/decent rate. Super stoked on this come up and hope everyone is doing rad!
Below is a pic of the the one rock and the smaller rock broken down. I don’t have access to a scale but this shit is def, at the very least, a gram and a half. I think it may even be a point or two mores

I also want to qualify something about the type of user I'm addressing.  There are people in this sub who are pretty hardcore.  Props to them.  I have no doubt those people can find the things that they want in Southeast Asia, but the risks are actually pretty huge.  The days of simple bribes are mostly gone.  This post is intended for what I assume are the remaining 85% of you who enjoy regular to semi-regular opiate use through pills and the like.  Those of you who read, but likely don't post because you can't associate your regular life with routine drug usage.  You're the ones who would be enticed by the stories I continually read on here.  I've spent a lot of time in most all of the Southeast Asian countries and so I just wanted to share some facts.  Entirely a throw-away.  Apologies for that.

It definitely used to be the case - even as recently as 5-10 years ago - that you could walk into a pharmacy in most SE Asian countries and get mostly whatever opiate you wanted.  This is NOT the case now.  I really can't reiterate more.

**Thailand**: has become incredibly strict.  You can definitely find Tramadol and 30/500 codeine blister packs at some pharmacies, but you're not going to find hyrdos, oxy, fent patches, or anything like that.  Yes they exist.  Yes if you go to dozens upon dozens of pharmacies, ONE is eventually likely to sell you.  But it's not easy to do and you'll have to look pretty hard without a source.  I've asked around a lot in recent months and most pharmacists just won't sell them.  A lot of pharmacists will give you a pretty dirty look just for asking.  There are definitely areas where opium is more readily available (eg: you wouldn't feel unsafe getting it), but note that this is absolutely very illegal and you don't want to be caught.  The penalties are severe.

**Myanmar**: very unlikely to find anything.  They've passed laws prohibiting virtually any kind of opiate from being sold over the counter.  I recently spoke with several pharmacists in a few different cities.  They were happy to explain it.  You may be able to get Tramadol, but that's about it.  Yes, there is a lot of H in the country, but this is not something you're likely to track down given the risks.

**Vietnam**: very few opiates to be easily found.  Again, they've had relatively strict laws put in place to prohibit the sale of opiates and most pharmacists definitely seem to abide.  You can likely find some stronger hydros/oxy on the outskirts of some towns, but it'll start to feel pretty sketchy pretty quickly.  Vietnam villages are dirt poor.  They WILL sell 30/500 effervescent tablets of codeine pretty much everywhere and I believe Tramadol is mostly available.

**Philippines**: just watch the news for 5 minutes.

**Singapore/Indonesia**: pretty much the same as the Philippines, but with fewer deaths.  Though in Indonesia there are a lot of islands so maybe it's around some of them.  I've not found it in the more popular areas.

**Cambodia**: possible to find oxy and hydro, but it's not easy.  If you have transportation and are really willing to go from pharmacy to pharmacy for quite some time, you'll eventually come across pharmacists who are willing to sell you these.  Bear in mind though that they are absolutely not permitted to do this and most take the law very seriously.  If you do find it, you'll pay pretty dearly for it; please understand you're really just paying off the pharmacist - not technically buying an OTC medicine (which was otherwise permitted just a few years ago).  Occasionally you'll come across OxyNorm which dissolve on/under the tongue and occasionally just tablets.  Everything will be packaged by MundiPharma (an Indian company) and the quality will definitely vary.  I've tried them all.

**Laos**: some yes, but mostly no.  Laos has cracked down hardcore on drugs in recent years.  Stories exist all over the place - mostly of Aussies getting busted with some small quantities of drugs and not being allowed to pay bribes.  Those that do typically have to pay about $400-$600 PER officer that is around.  They really don't fuck around with it any longer.  There ARE places that are willing to break the law and you can definitely find the 30/500 codeine tablets, but that's about it.  There are some towns that ""legally"" sell opium concoctions.  You can look these towns up easily on the web, but this is not pharmaceutical.

**China**: I read mixed things.  I haven't been to the more remote parts of China in a number of years, but more importantly, China is just enormous.  I'm sure pharmacists across the country are willing to sell, but it's definitely not readily available in the major cities (and I have personally checked through many of these cities in recent years).  

**Conclusions**: like I said, if you're one of those hardcore people who doesn't mind subjecting yourself to any kind of situation then this might not apply to you.  If you respond, I just hope you can put yourself in the shoes of other people who might not be as bold in their drug conquests.  For example, you can assuredly go to regions of Myanmar and get some of the strongest heroin available in the world.  BUT, these are very dangerous situations for most of us.  If you're a college graduate with a decent job who just happens to really enjoy opiates and isn't about to take such risks - especially in a foreign country where you almost certainly don't speak the language no less -  then beyond perhaps just asking a pharmacist or a local that you happen to befriend,  please understand SE Asia isn't the playground it used to be.  If you're comfortable walking down dark alleys with people you don't know in countries where you don't speak the language at the risk of imprisonment or physical harm, then you'll absolutely find everything you want in bountiful quantities.  And I'm not being cheeky, I just can't take those risks and I suspect many others in this sub can't either.

I'm also not meaning to be a downer and be super disappointing to people, but it just seems there is a great deal of misinformation about this topic - especially in the search results.  To be fair, a lot of it is just out-dated.  I hope that this sheds some light on the topic and I would strongly encourage others who have recently been to create a quick throw-away and reply with your experiences.  They've no doubt been similar unless you're able to be really honest about how you acquired them (eg: drove down some dark road in the jungle at night to meet some random guy in a hut and then drove 30 minutes back to your hotel with the drugs on you to consume them - some of you can handle that; most of us just read 5 nopes).

Finally, to the mods: I tried to be pretty informative and spent some time typing all of this up.  I realize that sourcing posts are strictly prohibited, but I'm only citing countries as a whole and specifically trying to explain how they're NOT sources - contrary to many tales in this sub.  My intention is to save people the heartache of arriving in these very distant destinations only to be super disappointed or worse, to subject themselves to pretty dangerous situations because they expected to stay high while abroad and didn't bring anything thinking that pharmacies were candy stores.  I avoided citing any cities within the countries and tried to keep things pretty general.  Just please consider the intent and that per rule #2 and #3, it's very non-specific and includes no localized information.  In short, if you feel it's still somehow over the line, please shoot a quick message for me to tweak it and/or redact/further-generalize certain parts.  I really do think this information should be more readily available to people in this sub.

**tl;dr: If you come across posts in this sub suggesting that opiates are readily available in Southeast Asia, please understand that these stories are either from people who found them only with (a) a great deal of luck, (b) a great deal of time, or (c) a great deal of risk.  Opiates, especially pharmaceuticals, are NOT readily available throughout most of SE Asia like they once were.  I posted this because many older posts state just the opposite (while often comments will challenge these notions in recent days).**",1507502034.0

They were bad.  Real bad.  Not the worst I have kept around in my junky carreer, but this is not my junky career.  I have been sober 2 months.  I like not being sick.

753mj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/753mj2/wake_up_its_an_emergency/,19,https://redd.it/753mj2,sloan_fitch,"Wake up, it's an ""emergency""","I wake up to a text message that I choose to ignore. It's my friend Clifford and one of the subsequent messages indicates that ""it's an emergency!"" 

It is my experience that ""emergency"" is an operant word that tends to preceed being asked to do something inconvenient. My  plan was to wake up, sip some coffee, take 1 or 2mg of bupe, eat a healthy breakfast and maybe even squeeze in some writing and exercise. 

&nbsp;

Ignoring messages usually works but my friend Cliff decided to walk on over to my house with his dog. So I get off my toilet seat, not like I was having much luck pushing anything out anyway and proceed to open my front door. Opened it and immediately turned around and went to my coffee maker while allowing Cliff to show himself in. I still don't remember what the emergency was. I know his mother fell that day, but obviously he handled that emergency. The emergency that Cliff was inconveniencing me over had to do with raising money for dope. 

&nbsp;

Although I am presently at a stage where I'm switching to street subs and likely to seek them out from a real doctor quite soon as well, I was alreay entangled pharmacologically and financially with my friend Cliff. Financially because we had a thing going for the past month and a bit longer. When I got paid and he was broke, I'd buy dope for both of us and when he got his script he'd pay me back in script. If he got paid when I didn't, then he'd buy dope that week. It kinda worked but there were a couple of pay cycles where I'd have spent all my money wthin one or two days. This is not sustainable.


**So about these entanglements**: When I last got paid, I bought three buns for Cliff which settled a debt that I accrued with him while buying two for myself. Tried to get four subs but the connect could only get two subs so one for me and one for Cliff. I would've much preferred getting three subs for me and one sub for Cliff. Cliff would've preferred gett two subs no matter what because he would take half a sub every day including the day of his (regularly scheduled GP/PM) doctors appointment.


Yeah, he said he would even take half a sub on script day. What kind of stupid shit is that? Like just hang in there for five hours. Well, he only has one sub to hold him over so my advice is simple. Cut it up into smaller pieces. My friend ain't about  that. Perhaps his tolerance was already built-up to subs and what works for me doesn't work for him. Nonetheless, with one sub to last four days he should do what I do. Half a sub on day one, 2mg on day 2, 1mg on day 3 and day 4. I've been amazed at how effective the smallest dose of bupe has been in the past.

&nbsp;

**Well anyway, because I'm such a nice guy**, I had set aside and reserved a crisp twenty-dollar bill for Cliff's script day. He asked me to do this a few times early in the week so that he could take a cab to and from the doctor. Well, on Friday when he  texted me ""it's an emergency"", he was trying to hustle something. So he sat in my kitchen brain storming what could be done. Ultimately he convinces himself that he could spend  that reserve $20, combine it with the $20 that the dboy owes me and get another $20 for a bun, *""to get through the weekend.""*


This lazy fat fuck can't just fucking cut his sub into 2mg pieces and suck it up? Instead he manages to talk me out of twenty more dollars. Granted, I'll get it back on script day but I'm not trying to stay hooked on opiates. I already had a close call with my family and lied my ass off. I figure this is as good a time as any to stop. 

&nbsp;

A month ago I said to Cliff, ""if I'm gonna run out of money this pay cycle, I'm gonna need to sell some of the roxies that you owe me in order to pay for a haircut."" Of course, the one person I could easily offload roxies to, Cliff doesn't like so he kindly treatens to cut me off, give me no roxies if I sell any of mine to this oher friend that he doesn't get along with. He said, ""when I get my big pay check I'll give you the money to get a haircut."" *Yah, sure*. I finally managed to get the haircut but only by carefully countering his con-games during the start of the following pay cycle. 

&nbsp;

In this most recent pay cycle, I needed to buy a $100ish dollar part for my bike. I had every intention to order it on Thursday night but did not because I had a bunch of unexpected bills of high importance hit me at just that moment. So I went ahead, I paid those bills and as a result have to wait 'til the next pay cycle to buy the part for my bike.

&nbsp;

Cliff did not know I paid important bills but he did know that I did not yet order the part for my bike. So on friday afternoon he proposed that I spend the money for my bike part so that he could get dope and that he would then pay for that bike part when he got paid on Thursday.

Luckily for me I already paid important bills. I told him that it's his choice to spend the $20 cab money that I was kind enough to set aside for him and he justified doing so. Basically said to himself and I, ""I'll walk to an from the doctor.""

My goodness, if I still had money for that bike part it would've soooo been ordered. I would've lied to Cliff and said ""I already ordered the part"" then proceeded to finalize my decision after reading some reviews and ordered that part. 

&nbsp;

His emergency was that he didn't want to fucking suck it up, couldn't survive the weekend on one 8mg sub and could hardly come up with a creative hustle. 

It's not even over. He asked me to drop by today to talk about details for his script day. I feel so divested. I work on his script day, and at this point I only want the roxies that are due my way so I can raise a few bucks and trade one for a sub. 

He asked me to bring any xanaxes I had over to his house today. He gave them to me a few days ago so it's not like I paid for them. I literally take one any time I Want to get a deep sleep. So I gave him my last four xanaxes knowing that he gets his roxies on monday which is what he offered in trade. After I gave him the xanax he fell asleep on his couch for two hours and I went back home to east dinner.

&nbsp;

Before Cliff went to bed he texts some shit about considering postponing his doctors appointment so that he could wait for unemployment pay to come in. I just don't see what there is to discuss. Like what can I do to help him in his endeavor? I hardly have any money left so he can't talk me out of any cash.

All I know is that if he gets his script monday and gives me anything out of it, I know someone whom I can trade with to get a sub. ",1507489188.0

I’ve been clean 2 1/2 weeks and just wanna share some stuff I’ve learned.,"First off, sorry if you are tired of the “xx amount of clean time” posts but I wanna talk about some stuff that helped me get clean. And this might be kinda long we’ll see.

So in December of last year, I went to treatment because my parents wouldn’t help me with college if I didn’t. I was in a corner and rehab was the only way out. I was actually almost done with my suboxone taper when I entered treatment. 

After being in treatment for a few days, I was at an emotionally low point, and looking back, I feel like I was brainwashed a little bit into the idea of abstinence from everything. Now I’m not saying that abstinence can’t work, but this ultimately led to my downfall I suppose. 

I stayed clean for about 4 months by exercising and going to NA and AA meetings basically because I had no other friends that were sober. At the time I literally thought AA/NA was the only way you could stay sober. It literally consumed my life. And it always made me think about doing drugs! Because when all you do is talk about your past, that’s what you think about right? I will say though, meetings can definitely help some people, but they just aren’t for me.

I relapsed on H after 4 months of being clean after feeling like I had been brainwashed. And that relapse really fucked me because I only did it a couple times then stopped, basically proving in my mind that I could handle it. Boy was I wrong. I had planted that seed in my brain again. 

After the relapse, I had about another month sober before I had surgery on my arm. I was not prepared for surgery because I had become a very active person. Always exercising and just being an outgoing person because that’s the true me when I’m sober. Of course, I didn’t tell the doctors anything about being an opiate addict and they prescribed me a good bit of Norcos. I was on these little bastards for like 3 weeks and since a couldn’t do much(arm in a sling), I got used to them bringing me happiness and filling my idle time. Let me also say that this is when I started doing junkie shit again like lying about using them. 

Well, after the Norcos ran out, I start hitting up old pill dealers for oxy and opana. The oxy and opana was for about a month before I got the great idea to shoot up heroin “just one time” lol. That “one time” literally turned into three times that same day haha. 

At this point I just told myself that I would kick before school starts back, but nope. I was FUCKING FOLDED the first couple weeks of school and failed the fuck out of one of my tests. Thankfully, I was running out of money and realizing how big of an issue this was that I stopped cold turkey. Holy shit, I was only doing 3 bags a day and that shit was rough! I can only imagine the people who quit on larger doses. 

I have been clean 17 days now with the help of OTC meds and pot. I truly believe that abstinence isn’t for everyone, atleast it’s not for me. I like to smoke a little weed from time to time. I like to have a drink from time to time. I haven’t even really thought about using heroin since I kicked, but if I would’ve chose to go to meetings, then I would be thinking about dope all the time! I truly feel like if the first time I relapsed, if it was something lesser like weed, it would’ve gave me a different headspace without giving me that total euphoria that opiates do. I just had dope on my mind because I sort of had a grudge against abstinence and wanted to go all out. 

I know the odds of using opiates successfully is about a million to one for me. But that doesn’t mean I have to stay in my past. For me, I just have to move the fuck on with my life. There are an infinite number of ways to stay clean, for some people it’s the 12 steps, for some it’s the SMART thing, but for me it’s totally removing myself from that part of my life and filling in my time with new hobbies like exercise, meeting new friends, working on my studies, etc. 

Much love to you all, especially the mods that help maintain this safe place for us.

The following describes my life. It was not written by me but it accurately depicts what each and every family endures as they witness their beloved child, spouse, parent go through addiction and its consequence.  Thank you for reading.

Dear active drug user,

I know you believe it’s your life and you’re only hurting yourself. You’re wrong. I know you believe you’re indestructible, that what you’ve witnessed happen to so many of your friends won’t happen to you. You’re wrong again. Sooner or later it will.

Here’s what will happen after you die.

First, someone will find your body. Maybe you’ll die at home and your Mom will find you and start screaming. Maybe you’ll die in your bedroom; maybe in the basement that your Dad rebuilt so you and your friends would have a place to chill. 911 will be called and first responders will come. Paramedics will cut off your shirt, put the paddles on your chest and try to shock your ass back to life, but it won’t work and one of them will turn to your Mom or Dad and say, “I’m sorry, he’s gone.”

Your family will be ushered outside, the police will string up that yellow “crime scene” tape and start their investigation. Your cell phone will be confiscated and your parents will probably never see it again. Hours later, while neighbors start gathering on the front lawn, they’ll put your body in a bag, put the bag on a stretcher and wheel it out to a coroner’s van and take you to the morgue. Maybe they’ll cut you open, take out all your organs, weigh and measure them and them stuff them back inside you and sew you up. More likely, they’ll just draw some blood and urine to do a toxicology screen.

Hopefully, you won’t die in your car. If you do, I hope you’re not driving at the time. I hope the last thing you do on this earth isn’t crashing into and killing someone else, maybe more than one person. I pray that’s not your legacy. If you don’t die at home, your parents will get a visit from the local cops and a ride down to the coroner’s office so they can identify your body.

That first week after you die will be a busy time for your parents. They will need to figure out who in what was your life needs to be notified; the rest of the family, your friends – that will be difficult because the cops have your cell phone so all they’ll be able to do is tell one or two of your closest friends; most of the rest will hear about it pretty quickly, but some won’t learn for weeks — your employer, your school. Lots of tearful phone calls will be made.

Your parents will have to pick a funeral home, arrange for your body to be shipped from the coroner’s office to the funeral home, pick out a casket, find a cemetery, one close by, so your Mom can visit you every day; pick out a nice four by eight foot plot, maybe beside a tree, and buy the only piece of real estate you will ever own. Your Mom will have to pick out the suit you’ll be buried in and deliver it to the funeral home. Your parents will need to decide what your obituary should say; should they acknowledge that you lost your battle with addiction or simply say that you died quietly at home.

Your Mom will go through all of this in a fog because she will be out of her mind with grief. Maybe she’ll carry one of your unwashed shirts around with her for the entire week, holding it to her face so she can smell you. Maybe she’ll sleep in your bed with your shirt and a framed photograph. And she won’t stop crying. Everywhere she turns something else will remind her of you. The leftovers from the last food you bought; the stale remnants of the last soda you ever drank.

One of the women in the neighborhood will organize folks to deliver casseroles and other food to your parents and neighbors will stop by once or twice a day for a week or so bringing food. Preparations will need to be made for your funeral. The church or hall will have to be decorated. Your Mom will want lots of pictures of you and each one she picks out will cause her to cry again. Eulogies will be written and delivered, maybe by your father, maybe by your little brother, maybe both. Your family will stand in a receiving line and will have to hear, “Sorry for your loss” and say, “Thank you for coming.”

After the service, your coffin will be carried outside to a hearse; maybe your little brother will be one of the pallbearers. The hearse will lead a procession of cars, all with their lights on, to the cemetery where there will be more tears, and a prayer will be said before your casket is lowered into the ground. Not everyone will have gone to the cemetery. Someone will volunteer to go to your parent’s house directly after the funeral to set out the food your neighbors have brought for the mourners who will come over after the funeral.

In the weeks after your funeral there will still be more matters to attend to. Your parents will have to wait for the toxicology report to be sent to the coroner’s office so that final death certificate can be prepared. Your parents will need lots of copies so they can notify your creditors, close your bank account, cancel your auto insurance, maybe notify your parole officer.

In the months and years that follow, things won’t get any better. Every holiday will be a time of sadness instead of joy, because it will remind your parents that you’re gone. And now they have another anniversary to make them sad, the anniversary of your death.

I can tell you for a fact that your Mom will never be the same. Some things she used to do joyfully she will no longer be able to do because they are too painful. Remember how she used to like to surprise you with special treats she bought at the food store? Well now she can’t go food shopping because everywhere she turns in the store she sees something she remembers you liked to eat. Those gardens she was so proud of in the front lawn. They’re forgotten now. The only garden she cares about is the tiny one around your grave that she tends almost every day.

So don’t think, and don’t say, that it’s your life and you’re only hurting yourself because that is simple not true. Your actions have consequences and they can be irreversible for you and can destroy the lives of people who love and care about you. Please, please, please, get clean, if not for yourself, then do it for them.",1507647399.0

here's a bit of background, been clean off of fent for six months, sobered up, relapsed with heroin, been sober from that for a month now, taking kratom everyday to manage cravings & to stay sober from opiates, here we go.

so we all know the epidemic is blowing out of fucking proportion right now and it doesn't seem like it's going to get any better soon, unless you know your h is pure you won't need to switch to fent, but if you get the bad batch of h, with fent, and ur tolerance isn't that heavy, it's fucking lights out. anyways here's my pros and con of each opioid

FENTANYL

PROS
- way way cheaper than heroin, id recommend dnms to get the best bang for ur buck on this stuff, many analogs to choose from to
- since it's so cheap, you will NEVER EVER EVER be dopesick because you'd have so much and it's so strong!
- strongest opiod in medicine XXL NOD!
- withdrawals are really short and this drug does not feel as addictive as heroin (personally)
- fent has the highest bioavailability through nasals, so no more track marks! unless u choose to
iv

CONS
- withdrawals are way worse than heroin if your doing a very very high dose (5mg daily habit at peak) i don't even think the strongest sub will ever cover you at kind of tolerance
- not as euphoric as dope, idk why it just isn't, but it's XXL NOD
- very easy to overdose on if you have no idea what your doing with it, i heard narcan won't even bring you back
- short lasting 

HEROIN

PROS
- WAY wayyy more euphoric than fentanyl, hands down, much more happy happy nod
- a lot les potent than fent, not as easy to overdose on (this is changing with the dope being cut with fent)
- last way longer than fentanyl
- has a rush to it!

CONS
- way too fucking exspensive, you'll get fucking dopesick all the time if you don't have enough money to pick up more and more each time
- DOPE IS CUT WITH FENT NOW ADAYS WHICH IS KILLING EVERYONE
- ugly track marks depending on ROA
- withdrawals last a bit longer but not as intense
- weaker than fent

Aight well that's pretty much all the pros and cons i can think of atm, if you'd guys like to chime in and throw in more pros + cons that'd be appreciated, if you disagree with one of these pros + cons throw it in i want to see what you guys think about this in the comments, i'm curious to what the community has to say about these 2 very potent opioids. 

EDIT: i personally enjoyed fentanyl much more because i was never ever dopesick until i decided to quit, i was always well no matter what, because it was cheap and i had so much, and honestly, id never go back to h because it's so fucking risky now overdosing on h cut with fent because of this epidemic. this is all subjective tho, please chime in your 2 cents

When he came out I talked to him about why he didn't just tell me he wanted it for alcohol. He explained to me because people are generally more judgmental with alcohol. We talked for a few minutes and I told him I didn't judge him and noticed  it was lightning outside and almost 9pm. I asked him if he needed a ride home and he was very gracious and accepted. We talked as I drove him a few miles down the road to his apartment. When I got home a friend stopped by with a couple 30 mg morphines for me, totally unexpected. Made my day!

Only ever mixed gaba with smaller amount like 40. It has def potentiated the smaller amounts. I know gaba is a relatively safe drug, but not sure about the combo.

Also a little sketched out adding things before bed, when I want to sleep and can't be as conscious about my breathing.

As a side note I'm sure I jacked my tolerance to all hell this weekend. Crazy binge after I tore or sprained my scapula. Gonna try to go without next few days and rely on some benzos. Not much left and about two weeks til refill. Man I'm dumb. Sure that's pretty common haha.

I sent him a message and he got back with me pretty quick with the typical response that his scale has been acting up and his bad. He said he'll fix it on next pickup.

*I orginally sent this as a PM to a thoughtful individual on here, but the more visibility the better chance I have of getting some advice that could save me. Anyway, here goes:*

Thanks for your thoughtful reply to my essay, it was so long that I highly doubted anyone would reply because it was so long, but my motivation was just to get my feelings out in writing.

After my post, I came to the realization that getting clean is my second highest priority in the world. I really wish it were my first, but honestly my job is my first priority.

This is due to the fact that so many other facets of my life fell by the wayside due to my addiction that I cling to my job thinking that it makes me valuable. I recognize how foolish this is, but it’s my reality, even though I know my attendance suffers from trying in vain to WD.

Even though I value it immensely and would never do anything to jeapordize it on purpose, there’s a big part of me that would be immensely relieved to know it’s over and that I could focus 100% on trying to recover.

Even so, the mental toll of being a heroin addict (guilt, morning exhaustion, fucked up nose and dick that only half works, the lies, etc. etc. are coming to a head and I can feel myself getting close to cracking up. I honestly don’t know what to do, and I’m not brave enough to ask my parents for help. They think I’ve been clean for months and months.

Long story long, I guess I’m kind of hoping I’ll be blessed with insight sooner or later. If I had been at my job for two years instead of a year and four months I would be far more willing to take a month or two of FMLA (unpaid leave where u keep ur insurance benefits) and use it to go to rehab.


At two years you are sort of “tenured,” and it’s a lot harder for them to fire you. But until i get there, taking 2 months off could very well sink me.
I just don’t know guys. I am despairing. Thanks for listening.

75czdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/75czdc/i_typically_use_h_once_or_twice_a_month_lost_my/,7,https://redd.it/75czdc,sonty_the_gnome,I typically use H once or twice a month. Lost my plug and I hate cold copping in my area. Finally got a new plug and got high for the first time in 3 months. Was happily surprised for a number of reasons.,"I'm on the east coast and where I live it's extremely hard to find good dope even when you're willing to pay extra.

Prices are ridiculous for a bundle here and you're lucky if it's even average. Usually it's just shit at least half the time. I'm on subs so even though I don't use much, 16mg a day gives you a pretty decent tolerance and sadly and typical of my luck, opiates are my drug of choice and I've always had a high natural tolerance to them.

I have a fast metabolism so I don't have to wait 36 hours after my last sub dose to get a decent high, especially since I'm an IV user. My state you need a script to get needles at the pharmacy but I'm 15-20 minutes from the border to another state where you don't need a script and it's $12.53 for a box of 100 which I think is a pretty sweet deal.

Sorry for the long post but I want to give details to show why I'm so pleased.

 I finally get a friend who strictly does pills hit me up and says he has a coworker who sells him bud and happens to sell H. (My bundles still smell like some dank weed lol). Anyway. I'm in the suburbs about 15 minutes away from one of the worst cities crime and drug wise in America. This is going by crime per population. Not a huge city but it's usually in the top 3 for worst cities in the states.

In the city you can typically find buns for 2 for $40 or something similar. The problem is, it's usually complete shit and as a white guy in his mid 20s you stand out very, very much in these areas. It's not uncommon to get pulled over by the cops just so they can ask you why the fuck you're driving through here. Between that, undercovers in unmarked cars that look like some soccer moms vehicle watching hot spots, the high chance of being robbed, beat for your cash or just shot (took two bullets in the chest in April just trying to get a friend from the train station and a 17 year old tried to carjack me), I typically will avoid the area. Like I said, since I keep it to recreational usage and don't have to worry about getting sick, I just stay the fuck out of there.

Now once you literally leave the projects and bad parts of the city, prices skyrocket. The average, even being 5-10 minutes from the city is at least double per bundle. The further away the worse it gets. Typically me just being barely 15 minutes out, I usually get people trying to charge me $50-$60 a pop. I live very close to the local campus and those kids make it bad because most have parents with money (icy league price school) and they're dumb enough to pay ridiculous prices without even attempting to haggle. Most dealers can tell I've been around long enough and I won't pay more than $40 and if it's not at least decent they won't get my business anymore and I'll spread the word about them, which works because it's a very small state.

Anyway I met the new plug today, told me $35 a bun off the bat without haggling and while I'd still prefer $30 or so I decided to try a bit before arguing. I'd heard he's a stand up guy for a dealer which we all know is rare. He was not only right on time, but early and met me close to where I live even though he lives in the city. Already off to a good start but I'm always pessimistic with new dealers. Shit nowadays even a guy you've dealt with before can suddenly start giving you noticeably less quality shit and it's happening more and more.

I get 4 bundles. I get jealous when I see pics on here where people in other states get stamps with the square full or even half full with dope. Here you're average stamp has about 1/8 of it full. Was not surprised to see this guys stuff was the same. Anyway I go home and try 3 bags. It usually takes me 6/7 to feel anything beyond a tickle and a bundle shot to get a decent rush. I shot these 3 skimpy bags and felt like I'd shot about 8 bags of what normally goes around here and these bags were even a little smaller than usual.

I'm trying to save the majority for when it's been longer since my last sub dose because I get to use so rarely on account of being broke as shit. Also I should mention this was only about 12 hours since my last dose. I just did another 5 before posting this and again was not disappointed 😁. I believe I have found my new plug. He was pretty chill, on time, didn't try to give me 11 bag bundles instead of the standard 13 for this area, and delivered some quality shit. I didn't realize at first but the bundle I've been dipping into so far is stamped ""Toyota"" while the other 3 all are ""on fire"". I would assume he gets them all from the same place so hopefully the rest is just as good. This just made my day, especially since it's been a bad couple of weeks and the last 3 or so times I bought it was some of the worst shit I've ever had.

Thanks for reading my long and maybe not so exciting to most people post. I was just happily surprised and wanted to share my experience. Never even got his name but I've named him in my phone Douggie T. Just feels right.

I was sick and broke and has nothing at all to sell. $5 to my name. I laid in bed and have up trying to feel any better. If I was gonna get high it was because the universe remembered I was owed some karma. As I lay there kicking my restless legs, my neighbor knocked on my door. Juan is a 30 something year old guy that got refuge status. This dude told me stories of the hustles he had to do just for food...it makes being a junkie sound easy. Now that he was in America he turned his hustling game up. I open my door and let him in, carrying a duffle bag which I had gotten used to. ""Brother, I have a deal just for you, I would never sell this low to anyone!,"" He said, but me, as many of us are, am a master manipulator and could see the gears turning in his head, probably wondering if he should come up with a new opener.

  ""Brand New, pressure cooker, top qualify, $40 for you,"" he grinned, pulling a massive pressure cooker out of his bag. Fuck, just what I needed, a God damn pressure cooker. He failed to notice I didn't even have any dishes in my apartment not electricity. ""No man, id rather buy a suicide capsule. Opiates. Downer's. That's all I want to buy and all I'll ever buy."" Looking disappointed, he opened his bag back up, glancing in it a saw mac books, iPhones, and what looked like a plastic bag completely filled with watches. I always liked watches and I asked to look through them. Most were horribly faked rolexes, casios, and no names watches. ""Any one, $5, they're all real, I never sell fakes,"" he lied without a second thought to me. I was fucking sick, and done with this, as he packed up to leave, I notice in the bag a fossils watch. I asked to look at it. It was without a doubt real. ""I'll take this one, I can't believe I'm paying that for this fake ass watch."" Taking my $5 with a grin, I let him out, hearing him knock on the next apartment door.

    I could tell the watch was definitely real gold, and it even had a few Diamonds. After franticly searching online, I found the model number. They were not sold anymore, but I found a grip on eBay, all no less than $400. Well, junkie Jesus looked down with pity on me today. Okay, first I called my dealer. Nope. No trade. Okay, I put it on Craigslist for $200. No calls, even after two hours. So, convinced god had getting me high in his agenda today, I took 5 gabapentin and my absolute emergency two xnnax bars, and with great pain and suffering, walked to the bus stop.

   As the bus pulled up at the mall I had made a 180. I felt relaxed and the xnnax took away all the awful thoughts that had followed me all day. I still was sick, but so much less sick it almost was a high. I straightened my jacket, having intentionally wore my nicest clothed, took a deep breath, and went over the story I had made up on the ride. I had gone over it in my head so many times I almost could forget it was all bullshit. I was now a pissed off trust fund kid, angry about the shit watch I was sold, and for as long as it took I was not a junkie, I was not sick, I had more money than the workers at von maur, and things simply had to go my way.

  ""Mam, I need your assistance,"" I said with a frustrated sigh, pulling the watch out of a case. ""I received this as a present for my acceptance to my school of choice, from my fiance. For two monthss it worked great, it wore it more than most of my collection. Then it stopped working, ""I I said, with a tone that seemed more annoyed than mad. ""I'm so sorry sir, have you tried replacing the battery?"" She asked. ""The battery? Of course, it was the first thing I tried. Now I'll be honest, the only reason I'm here or even care about this is it was a gift from the woman I love. I'd like a replacement, and I feel like a gift card would be appropriate to reimburse my time today, but I'm in a hurry and I'll take a new WORKING watch."" The lady had a look of disbelief and confusion on her face. Taking the watch from me, she started looking for a new one on display. I could not believe it. This. Might. Work. I had to try hard to keep looking upset. After a while, she came back, looking almost worried. ""Sir, it seems we don't sell this model anymore. I can replace it with a watch of your choosing under $100. ""Absolutely not. I'm not a man who will see his fiance spend hard earned money on a gift for me that doesn't even work two months, and go tell her i can buy some Chinese brand watch I wouldn't put in my collection. What I want is a gift card I can give to her so her gift to me can be the satisfaction of giving her a gift. Really, this is the least you can do. I have a wedding in four months and I will not have any reasons for us to fight."" I said, with every ounce of seriousness I couldu muster. She quickly scurried away to talk to what looked like the floor manager. After what seemed like twenty minutes, she came back. ""We can give you $200 for the broken watch."" I should have aaid fuck yes Ill take it, but I was so cought up in my alter ego, I reminded her the watch cost $500, and she upper her offer to $350. Im betting her manager told her to offer 200 first. As she handed me the gift card, I said that even though this is a disappointment, I appreciate your efforts to help, and I won't make it point not to shop here. I walked away, gift card in hand. 

  As soon as I was out of her sight I couldn't hold it in. ""Fuck yes!"" I pulled my fist in the air. I got a few weird looks. it seemed now that I knew I would be getting high, the sickness almost seemed to go away. I knew exactly what to do. 

  As Juan pulled a roll of cash from his duffel bag, which i now couldn't help but notice contained an array of power tools, I counted out $260 as Juan called and checked the balance of the card. ""How did you get this anyways?,"" he asked, hanging up.
""I don't even know where to start,"".

Juan had gone, my plug arrived in record time once i told him how much I was buying. I laid down, as the first line of opana hit me, my pains disappeared, and I was floating. All the bullshit I went through seemed like a distant memory. That was the day I truly believed J.J od'd for my high.",1507585760.0

I'm also at work right now so doing huge lines is out of the question because I cannot Fuck up here. I have 8 and a half hours to go until I can really do it. 

I feel really bad about the overdose. I just got that fucking car like 2 weeks ago. My dad helped me pay for half of it. Also instead of telling them that I overdosed on heroin, I told them that I fell asleep on xanax. I have really bad anxiety, and my cousin has a script. My parents know that I take xanax sometimes so I had to tell them that instead of telling them what really happened. I hope to take that fact to the grave with me. Is it possible to fell an overdose about to happen and prevent it? Also is there way to sober up if you're too high? 

Thanks for any input

Ps: Is it possible for anybody to find out who I am by looking at my account?  Like basically can anybody see your email address and shit? I'm really paranoid and that's why I just lurk around on this sub and never post",1507578386.0

Is it dangerous to take tramadol almost everyday on the long term ? is it going to raise up my tolerance a lot also ?

I'm in the middle of carrying this out, but wanted to run the numbers by somebody else to make sure everything seems correct. From what I can tell, it's right, but another set of eyes and another brain to double check wouldn't hurt in case. I haven't had any negative effects thus far.

Goal: approx. ~1 ug/mL sol'n to add to each IV H shot

Process:

- crush up 50mg naltrexone tablet and add to 96 oz(~2839mL) sterile water
- sol'n of 0.0176 mg/mL naltrexone to water
- use syringe to remove 1 mL from sol'n which contains 0.0176mg naltrexone
- dilution formula C1V1=C2V2 to find V2
- dilute 1mL pulled with add'l 16 mL of water to create desired 0.001 mg/mL sol'n; this is equivalent to 1 ug/mL
- remove 1 mL from newly created dilution, add add'l water as needed to have enough to prep shot
- shoot as normal

Please double check my math and add any advice or tips you can here. I'm not worried about micron filtering as it's such a small amount though. I think I need to up my dose from 1 ug to around 15 though - thoughts?

I'm not currently physically dependent on any opioids.

Edit:  the post below says 1-2 ug per shot, maybe I don't need to up it then...?

How it works:
(From another thread)

Stay below 20mcg (micrograms) and space apart by at least 6 hours and your fine. No W/D's whatsoever.

It does not strip your receptors of anything. It prevents opiates from interacting strongly with the KOR's (Kappa Opioid Receptor) in your brain, while still allowing the opiate to interact with the MOR's (Mu Opioid Receptor). KOR's are supposedly the ones responsible for building tolerance and allegedly plays a role in physiological dependance. MOR's have everything to do with euphoria and the other positive (yet extremely few) benefits of opiates/opioids.",1507566865.0
