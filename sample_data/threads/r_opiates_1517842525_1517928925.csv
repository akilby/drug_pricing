7vlk9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vlk9f/nine_days_free/,5,https://redd.it/7vlk9f,onesadisticpup,Nine Days Free.,"and I must say, it's been quite the roller coaster.

I've lurked here for quite some time now, this is my first time posting, on anything on reddit in general, and I've been on here for years. 

I've been consistently taking opiates for 4 and a half years up until this point. 
Not gonna bore you with my life story but for a little background, at age 14(in 2009) I got drunk for the first time. Two weeks after that I tried adderall. Then xanax. I tried percosets and vicodin at this age too, but didn't really enjoy them that much, they made me throw up mostly and I thought the high was uncomfortable. I fell in love with xanax and was pretty bad on them throughout the rest of high school and beyond. After I graduated, I tried coke, shrooms, molly, ecstasy and drank pretty regularly.
In 2013 my mom got diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver(she was an alcoholic my whole life), was given 6 months to live, and was perscribed vicodin, via hospice.
I was in such deep pain, I just started taking them. Everyday. It was free, no one noticed any ever went missing, and when the script ran out they were delivered to our door step the next morning, free of charge. 
I never liked them until it was the only thing really making me feel slightly okay with having to deal with my mom being terminally ill.
So obviously I became mentally and physically dependant on them, she ended up living for a year and two months. I had quit on my own one month prior to her death.
The longest I went off of them was 3 months, in 2013/beginning of 2014 (2 months after my mom died)
When I relapsed, I tried roxys for the first time. It was a suggestion of my girlfriend at the time, who did roxys years back a lot recreationally. She wanted them for her birthday.
I blew my entire tax check on them and the rest is history.
I continued to do any type of pill I could get my hands on, or afford. Percs, vics, but I especially loved roxys.
As the years when on I got worse and worse on pills and basically all my money went to them.
Toward the end of 2017 I tried heroin for the first time. I loved it. I did that for months between pills also. (only snorted heroin, never IVed anything)

And now that leads us to right now.
Last Saturday was my first time off pills in my most recent several months binge, and as of right now it's been a full nine days. The first two days were brutal, and I was staying with a friend of mine who helped me through it. She refused to give me xanax or anything but ibuprofen to ease the WDs. At first I was pretty angry about it but in retrospect I'm happy she didn't cause I remember every detail of how awful it was and I'm glad. 

I've tried and failed quitting so many times. Never could really go passed 7 days clean. Boredom is my biggest problem sometimes. 
Also, this is the first time I've quit for myself.

I'm not in NA, but I've been before and I think I'll try again. 
Towards the end I was very suicidal and even with my drugs, I didn't really wanna get out of bed most days. I was sick of myself and what I had become. I was sick of hurting people over the years with my addiction. 

I gotta say since the WDs have stopped, I've been so much happier. I haven't felt this generally good in a long time. Without my crutch. I am still mourning it though, I do still crave it, and God do I miss it. 

I've been taking it day by day, and I truly do not want to go back to that. I want to continue to be free from its shackles, I've felt like a fucking slave for years, because I have been.

Sorry for the long post..I mostly did this as my own personal therapy, to extract all these thoughts out of my head.

Being off of opiates has so many more pros than cons, I finally wake up and feel normal. I'm not sick, I'm not instantly getting up to pop a pill or snort h, just to feel normal. 


If you actually read this, thank you and thank everyone on this sub. I hope everyone stays safe out there, and if you want to quit..it's so fucking worth it. 
I hope I never fall back into its clutches.",1517899536.0

I have a chronic illness that causes my joints to dislocate frequently. I am in a ton of pain all the time and because of these dislocations, I end up getting major orthopedic surgery very frequently. We are talking 3-7 surgeries every year.

My doctors are very cautious about prescribing me any sort of pain medication (even getting stronger anti-inflammatory medications can be a challenge). However, when I get surgery, I typically get prescriptions for whatever I need. I'm in the military which has random drug tests and I need a recent prescription to be able to keep my job, so this is very important and legality is also an issue.

Here are my biggest issues that I need help with because I can't keep living like this: 

1. I have an addictive personality. I can become addicted to random stuff like video games and cake without any issues. I know for sure I would have an alcohol issue, so I just don't keep it around my house. Here's the problem: I get major surgery and get worried I'm going to get addicted. I debate whether or not I should use the pain killers *at all*. Typically, I stop taking them after 48 hours or so, even though I'm in agonizing pain and essentially only sleep when I physically pass out. My doctor asks me to please take the meds for 2 weeks or longer, but in the past, I knew it was going to be a problem MUCH before that  - and I know he wouldn't help me with the aftermath.

How can I conservatively use these medications without causing a ton of issues for me in the future? I mean, there has to be some happy medium between not using them at all and becoming addicted, but I just don't know how to gauge it.

2. When I do take the meds for more than a couple days, I need to be able to work from home because I don't have enough time off work to go to physical therapy and recover. However, I CANNOT for the life of me stay awake for more than a few hours at a time when I take even a basic dose of Percocet. I alternate with an NSAID, but even caffeine can't keep me awake/alert. I only take one pill every 8 hours or so... Any suggestions?

3. Tramadol does nothing for me. At all. No pain relief or anything, which is surprising because other opiates knock me on my ass. Is this common? How do you suggest that I communicate this problem since doctors feel like Tramadol is the only thing that they can safely prescribe WITHOUT sounding like I'm a drug seeker?

4. How do you deal with family and friends that act like you're subhuman for using these medications? If I tell people I can't drink beer because I'm on Percocet, my friends act like I need to go to AA and need an intervention. I can't help but feel dirty when they react this way.

5. Constipation, lack of hunger, and sex drive - any advice here? I sometimes don't eat for 24 hours or longer when I'm on them.

This issue will never go away and will just get worse with time, so I want to be able to have as healthy of a relationship with these meds as possible.

I appreciate your help.",1517892114.0

I am so fucking sick of the misinformation, naivete, stupidity and outright lies regarding our plight I vomited out a fucking novel to this person. 

Y'all got any edits, additions, retractions or ideas? Thanks!

> Heroin has no medical benefit

Actually, heroin has huge medical benefits and is one of the most innocuous drugs out there. It is used in most countries under it's generic name diacetylmorphine or diamorphone. ""Heroin"" is a brand name patented by its creator the Bayer corporation (yeah, the aspirin guys) in 1892 or so. About the only physical effects it has on a person is constipation.

Now, the risk of addiction and possible overdose is really bad, but the main problem with overdose is the inability to get anything where you have any idea whatsoever the potency (that and the dealer fuckwits are cutting EVERYTHING with fentanyl nowadays make it a serious gamble.

But, that just proves my point. Put supply under the purview of the FDA or some such so that addicts can get a consistently reliable product where they know the strength and know there are no adulterants. That right there would eliminate the VAST majority of overdoses (trust me, most addicts have damn near Doctor of Pharmacology level knowledge of their drug of choice).

As far as a rise in addiction? Nope... if heroin was legalized tomorrow and you could go down to the corner market and get some would you? I would bet my life that will be a no. Neither will the VAST majority of people. Education is what we need. How many new smokers are there every year? Not a lot. Why? Because of the education today's youth has regarding it's dangers. Kids, for the most part, aren't stupid regarding such things.

Anyone else that takes up the habit voluntarily will do so regardless of the criminal consequences.

The vast majority of new addicts are a direct result of the actions of doctors over prescribing opiates. Now they are trying to close that barn door by shutting shit down totally and leaving Jenny Johnson from the 'burbs with a raging percocet addiction in a world of shit. Once the dope sick hits her (or anyone honestly) they are going to do whatever is necessary to ""get well"".

Usually (or in my case) the steps are:

* Multiple doctors in different areas 
* Faking pain in local ERs 
* Forging scrips or begging for friends/family's leftovers or having them fill their unwanted scrips for you
* Straight stealing friends/family's scrips
* Finding an illicit seller of pills
* Figuring out the going price for pills is $1/mg and realizing heroin is much cheaper (your pill supplier usually informs you of that)
* Snorting/smoking heroin
* Realizing you are wasting too much that way and the effects take too long to arrive
* Asking your dealer for a clean rig and crossing the line into IV use
* Not having a clean rig so you reuse old ones
* Your old one's needle is so dull it doesn't work or it plugs/breaks
* You borrow your ""friend's"" rig because of course they are clean... you wouldn't hang out with some diseased person right?
* You just don't give a fuck anymore and your life is off the rails
 
I understand you are a bit naive regarding this stuff. I was too. But would you go to a brain surgeon for a heart transplant? No. Brain surgeon isn't dumb, he just doesn't know much about heart transplants.

So. let the experts handle this. Pretty much every expert in the field of addiction medicine and social work agrees harm reduction and the end of the drug war is the ONLY answer to this absolute nightmare we find ourselves in/

We are very slowly moving in the right direction. but a staggering amount of lives are going to be lost before anybody in power gets their head out of their ass and fixes this shit

Peace y'all

Edit: Oh, BTW, this was in response to the following I wrote about how we can fix the ""opiate crisis"". She disagreed and said ""heroin is too dangerous"" to unleash on the virgin populous of our great country.

>I subscribe to the [Portugal method](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it) of dealing with addiction and all the bullshit that accompanys it.

>Decriminalize everything across the board. Keep dealing and trafficking where it is at.

>If a person is caught with a drug of some sort, write them a summons to appear before a Legal professional (judge), medical expert (in addiction medicine) and some sort of social work expert.

>If the user can demonstrate that they use responsibly (they hold down a job, don't rob people, are generally not hairballs) then they go on about their business. If their live is off the rails then they are ordered into state-financed treatment based on current addiction medicine protocols (no bullshit AA/NA... I'm talking CBT and individual life skill, financial and related therapy).

>Pay for all of this with the money you save not locking people up for what has been proven to be a legitimate medical/psychiatric issue and not continuing this idiotic ""war on drugs"".

>Allow users to obtain pharmaceutical grade drugs from a licenced or otherwise government run source.

>Drug cartels will collapse overnight. Billions in wasted money saved, police, court, social service and emergency medical providers will be freed up to concentrate on the real problems.

Seems simple to me.

When I was an IV heroin addict 3 years ago and was homeless with no place to go, I thought that was my rock bottom. When I relapsed after a year and 4 months sober and lost everything I worked hard to get back in that time in just two weeks I thought I hit rock bottom. I have been clean off opiates for over 6 months now, and 2 months off suboxone. So what’s the problem you might ask? I tried crack cocaine for the first time 3 weeks ago and have lost complete control of my life. The reason I say I am truly at my lowest point in my life is because I know now it’s not the material things that you lose or don’t have anymore. I have worked really hard to get where I am now. I live in a gated community that is 20mins away from the one of the nicest beaches in the east coast, I have a job that I actually enjoy going to work everyday, and most importantly a fucking amazing and supportive girlfriend and group of friends and family. I had to earn a lot of trust back and trust me it took a lot of time. I got hooked on crack when I went to my dealers house to grab some vyvanse and they asked if I messed with it. I had only tried crack three times in my life before then and it was back when I was using heroin and never thought it wasn’t all that great. Long story short, here I am 3 weeks later and I can’t stop. I’ll get two days sober and then have dreams about it where I can feel like I’m actually high in my dreams then I wake up craving it. I told my girlfriend and my best friend the truth about everything last weekend, after I had a mental breakdown high off crack and tried to get in a high speed chase I hit 132mph in my mother’s Mercedes while crying hysterically. I pulled over to the side of the road and just started praying for help. I had 4 days sober after that, then bought a 30 sack after I had a couple drinks at an oyster roast. I know I’m being so selfish and I know I’m on the verge of losing everything that I’ve worked so hard for in my life, but I am completely broken. I don’t even enjoy getting high anymore, all it does is cause me anxiety, but I can’t fucking stop. On top of it all I have type B strain flu virus, and I know smoking this much is just making me more sick. I know this isn’t opiate related but if anyone has any experience or advice that would help in anyway it would be so appreciated. Thank you to whoever read this and be safe y’all. ",1517881827.0

As I walk up he produced a small baggie and asked if I wanted a bump - it was coke and he told me he had it on deck if I needed any. Told him it wasn't really my thing unless it was offered at a party. He gave me his number ""just in case"", which I appreciated, and I  figured that would be the end of it.

Fast forward to this past Friday - my plug was being unresponsive and I was getting sick and desperate. I began to go through my overflowing list of contacts to see if any of the folx in my phone would be able to provide a viable solution to my problem. I saw my coke-dealing coworker's number and thought - ask if he has a friend who has black.

Took a while for him to reply but once I asked, he told me that HE had the hook on it! I was ecstatic, asking when he could hook me up and all the other details in true junkie form. He told me he was at work but could hook me up later that night after his shift. Guess what? I haven't heard from him since.

I genuinely don't get it. All he had to say was ""nah I don't fuck with that."" What was the point of leading me on just to completely flake on me? What the actual fuck? If you're not the *plug* do NOT act like the fucking plug! Such a waste of time - and there's nothing I hate more than a goddamn, motherfucking FLEX!!!

I still feel regret over throwing away seven months of complete sobriety and I wish my junk-fucked brain weren't so convincing in telling me "" *chipping* is fine bro "".

But to be fair, I'm doing a lot better. I recommend you guys try the same. Stay sober and let your tolerance deplete , then switch to another ROA. I know what the needle fixation feels like, I was strung out badly for two years on daily dope and weekend-ly speedballs. 

It's so much easier to keep your tolerance in check when you're not banging. A gram lasts me three days now that I smoke, back then I'd need a gram and a half to stay well all day. Plus your WD will be much worse when you're shooting, since your body absorbs more dope due to bioavailability and therefore your habit is more severe. 

It's just more fun. Smoking dope is a casual affair, watch some TV while chasing the dragon, just chillax. Whereas shooting would always end with me tearing my jugular open and dousing myself in blood like some pagan blood priest.

So here it goes. I've been using opiates sense I was mid 20s. Not I'm mid 30s. I'm going to fast forward to heroin. I was using about 2 grams a day by IV. I couldn't afford to. Couldn't  keep up with it so I got put on methadone. Of course I still used heroin but now I was only using heroin once a day for the most apart. Unless l had extra money then j would use more. It helped because methadone keeps me from having to stay well all day and night. But I'm at 65 mg so by the night time sense I dose in the morning I start to feel crappy. This is when I usually do my shot. I'm from the west coast and all we get out here is tar. I wanted to try all the other types dope I had heard about. Plus I was having to shoot a half a gram of tar to blast thru the methadone. So I started getting interested in the dark net and the dark net markets. So much tasty looking things on there. East coast powder dope. Golden triangle pure powder. Etc etc. But dark net markets take bitcoins which to me looked like a pain in the ass to get at that time. 

I use to do surveys online to buy cool shit with the gift cards you can chose to cash out in. So I bought things like a PS4. A 55k 4k tv etc etc. Then one day I stumbled upon a survey site that had a higher payout system then the other I was using and surprise surprise. They paid out in Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash etc etc. I was excited. Fast forward to now.  I make about 400-500 a month on my survey site. Which I use to buy my dope online. I've tried all kinds and had some really good stuff before. I ran across a listing once for synthetic heroin. When I read the feedback people where saying it was super strong and it was free to sample so I decided to try it out. When it came I was super careful as everyone said how strong it was. I put maybe about a quarter of a match head in the spoon and did it up. It was so strong I was scared I was going to OD. That .1 sample ended up being 10 doses for me. So it went a long way. Now I'm at the point where I buy a .3 or .5 every week and a half it I love it. I like it because it doesn't fuck up my veins. It's like shooting water. With black tar seems like I fuck a vein up and soon as I use it. On this stuff I can use the same vein over and over and be cool. I do try regular dope from time to time when like a new vendor will pop up with some good sample deals and I'll buy some stuff. The really really good pure powder heroin online is like 200 bucks a gram and that is why I mostly stick to my synthetic heroin which I know is a fent analog but at least it's a good one with nice rush and legs as well.  I can say if I use too much of it for like days straight then my tolerance goes up and I have to slow down so my tolerance slows back down. For anyone that messes with any kind of fent read about what your doing and what the chemical does to you as well first. ",1517863729.0

I don’t have many close homies, and the ones I do are probably sick and tired of me but hung about it. But basically back in Spring of ‘17 I was hustling with my baby mama. Life was damn good! We both were working and used that money to pay the bills. And meth was selling in our town for fucking $120 a gram all day. So we spoiled our daughter, and for a good while there all we did was smoke weed. My daughter was never around drugs by my hand. But... shit started to change. We started making less and less money, because baby mama was dipping into the supply. I honestly didn’t notice for a LONG time. But eventually it became obvious.

I started having to lock the dope up at a locker at my place of work. I’d give her an allowance but she’d need more and more and MORE! Until we started getting into vicious fights about it. Eventually she got me locked up, stole all our money and split out of the state with my daughter. She’s out where drugs are much more scarce, and she’s NEVER been a bad mother so I’m not worried... definitely miss my baby girl because she was my best friend hands down. Used to have tea parties and dance parties every day with that little rascal... but I get to FaceTime her and visit when I can. So it’s okay now.

I ended up moving back home and meeting this TIGHT 18 yr old friend of my sisters. This chick was a cutie and was only 4 foot and 9 inches. That’s a legal fucking MIDGET homie. I swear to god that pussy was the best I will EVER encounter. We fucked 3 times the first night we hung out inside a hotel room I purchased. She had no idea that I was back to my shit... doing a little bit of heroin and pills whenever I could get away. Eventually she caught me, and she actually wanted to do it! At first I thought it was amazing and I started getting back into the pill game selling and smoking em up. She fell in love with me, but would say shit like “these [pills] just make me love you so much more” hahahaha so right there I knew how this was gonna end up. 

I got a job opportunity out of town that was too good to pass up on. She moved with me, but not before pushing me (didn’t have to push to hard) to rob my pill dealing (close family member). We dipped to this hotel two and a half hours away from home were I was gonna start working. And that’s when shit when down hill. My pill dealing fam called me out and shit. She ended up fighting with me about it, and SHE flushed all of my fucking pills. I’m talking 15 of the 30 M’s, probably about two dozen Morphines, and a shit ton of Xanax. Idek how much haha. 

After she flushed the pills the next day she was withdrawing hard. She had never done hard drugs before, and she blamed everything on me. Which ya know... some of it was my b. I was more than eager to get her hooked like me. But anyway, she ended up robbing me while I lay in bed dying, taking my clothes, and taking the car that we took out there. She dipped back home without me, and while the car was technically hers and all... I just paid outrageous amounts to fix it up and get it inspected and registered. So that was fucked. Me and her have hooked up a few times since the break up, just because I probably won’t ever be able to turn down that midget pussy. Just take my word for it, it’s the wettest tightest shit in the fucking world lmfaooo. 

A few months after our break up the legal midget girl moved out of state to stay with her cousins. I text her occasionally and I’d do anything to get back with that girl. And not just for the world class chocha. She was a good one for sure. But anyway I was back on the prowl. 

At this point I was single and I was back ON man. Started feeling proud about myself again. Got a GOOD job working my ass off in a ducking coal mine. I showed up lit as shit everyday and had an amazing Junky Credit Score. Dealers in my home town were like in love with me lmfao. And while I was out partying with my mostly drug free friends, I met another girl who I still consider to be light years out of my league. 

She had that vibe where you could tell she used to be goth in high school, but now she just wore black and got tattoos. Her hair was dark and her skin was like an olive color. She ended up slipping to me that she ‘liked heroin’ while it was just me and her sharing a smoke outside. My eyes probably lit up like Christmas. I told her if she wanted to get high she just had to give me a ride. I ended up not being able to score that night. But for the next week all we did was kick it when I was off work and smoke tar. 

I eventually got ousted from my home because of drug use, and lost my ride to work. I lost the job, but used my last check to go on one hell of a binge with that girl. It took a surprisingly long time before we actually hooked up. But when we did I was glad. She had that junky style skinny that we all know fairly well. And I honestly think that is the hottest type of body there is...

We just got hotel rooms, racked up drug debts, and fucked. We had a lot of fun, except for the times my dick was to drugged out to work lmdaooo. I got her to eat my ass one time lmfao! I’m not into fingers up there, but a tongue feels heavenly. Eventually my money ran out though, so we were living at my grandmas and eating off her allowance from her mother (chick was 19 but still dependent on her rich ass momma). That just stresses any situation out a lot, and I knew it was bound to end. I caught mad feelings for that girl, but I’m just to high anymore to give a fuck. Even she fucking moved though! Like 3 hours away hahah! They all **really leave** when they ‘leave’ me hahaha. Me and her still text too, and I’m gonna be visiting her in her town soon. Cause she might not have been as wet or tight as the midget girl, this girl is stunning and so much better at having sex. Skills pay the bills baby. ",1517821061.0

So, if any melbournians/australians are aware, Codeine is prescription only, which is a horrible decision, not because i want a cheap high that will kill my liver, but because people have legitimate pain and the government really thinks that it would solve the opiate crisis...

If you're not aware of my situation, im 23 and i have chronic back pain, or, sciatica, with spinal stenosis and scoliosis, all of which aggravates my back a crapload.

I'm stuck on what american's call tylenol 3, (500mg paracetamol, 30mg codeine), it doesn't even tough the pain but it does enough for me to not cry out in pain every time i move. I'm fucking sick of relying on pills to feel somewhat better, but it's the only option i have... i tried requesting for shit like low dose oxycodone, just so i can get an alternative treatment or atleast a different pill that can help, no-go, the doctors here are tighter then a nuns cunt. I got prescribed 200 panadeine fortes (sorry, tylenol 3's), and im already almost out (got them on the 20th of last month)... i know its an unhealthy amount im taking, but its either take the recommended dosages and still be in pain or step it up and risk liver fucking damage, which is my biggest fear. 

I know people recommend the CWE (?) method, but if i remember correctly, codeine and paracetamol work well together, and codeine alone isn't much of a pain killer, its more of a recreational thing... but im stuck between a fucking rock and a hard place and already this year ive thought about doing myself in. Pain is horrible every day, i wake up and i can't move unless i literally roll to the other side of the bed, take my pills, wait in agony for an hour until they kick in and then i can slowly get up and walk around, im fucking 23 and i feel like a WW2 vet with 70 year old injuries. Every day i wake up crying, both in sadness and in pain as i realise that this is my life now. 

I hate opiates, and i love them too, i hate the negative stigma around them but i also understand them, im so confused about life right now, and for the past 4 years i feel like ive been living on these pills more then on life itself. 

Even now im practically sobbing, you guys might see me as a username who can type but fucking oath ive been battling this horrific pain for almost 5 years and im sick of it.

Not to mention my painkillers (200 T3's) run out in 2-3 days and withdrawals + incredible back pain is going to send me over the edge, and im scared.
