How do I do that without flat out asking the dentist? Most likely his answer will be a no.,"I am getting my wisdom teeth removed on friday. It's fairly standard procedure to have T3's prescribed to you as the pain doesn't warrant anything stronger. I know some doctors are more lenient than others on prescribing harder opiates. My goal is to get 5mg oxy's but I'd be happy with percs.

Since I'm not very likely to have a stronger rx written by blatantly asking for one, I'm planning on telling the surgeon I am allergic to acetaminophen. What is the likelihood he will prescribe something stronger? If low, what other creative strategies would you suggest that may work?

Instead of solid, clear, intelligence the internet has become a sort of reverb chamber for false, dangerous, and completely unnecessary information.

When you are trying to learn about something which is controversial, illegal, or taboo the misinformation and ignorance is amplified.

I'd like to share everything Leon knows about opiates.  Every statement here is coming from his extensive first hand experience.  If Leon isn't sure, he keeps his mouth SHUT.

Read on if you are interested in poppies, opium, pills, addiction, withdrawal, potentiation, , seeds, interactions, allergies, preparations and combinations, safety, and dosages.

1.  The Flower - it all starts with a beautiful flowering plant papaver somniferum.

Please erase the Afghan or Iranian desert image from your mind; along with the east Asian jungle - that was disinformation.  These beauties grow best in places where veggies and flowers flourish with ease - like your backyard.  Cooler, rainier places like WA, OR, MN, could grow opium crops without irrigation that would leave Afghanistan in the dust. 

There are hundreds of various flowers within this species.  Forget the flowers, learn what Somniferum leaves look like and you will be able to spot opium poppies in every neighborhood wherever you may live.

Bigger is not better.  Don't get scammed.  Large pod varieties were bred to help opium scraping laborers be more efficient - not to help you!  If you are drying whole pods, who gives a shit?  5 small (quarter size) dried pods unslit can be more potent than one giant (roma tomato) dried pod which even weighs more.

They grow almost everywhere.  They grow like weeds that you can't get rid of elsewhere.  One ripe flower spreads almost a thousand seeds.  Leon has seen many vegetable gardens so overcome with poppy seeds that they had become the dominant ""weed seed"", meaning that if no care was taken to pull non vegetable plants from the garden that poppy flowers would dominate without any special care.

Forget about opium.  Yes it's pleasant, but its not worth the cost of time/labor or addictive mess.  If properly grown and prepared pods don't get you off then you're already in the world which heroin and 30mg oxy fuel as ""maintenance drugs"" to stave off withdrawal sickness.  If you're not there, Leon recommends that you steer clear of that shipwreck.

How effective are dried pods?

Holy shit do they ever work!  Leon scouted out a large public garden which in two visits each spring, dried promptly, yields enough fun to get him floating, nodding, lucid dreaming, and grinning to last ALL Freaking YEAR!!  Brewing at least every 5-7 days.

Please re-read the above and ponder.... Leon often spends $0 for his enjoyment.

How to achieve similar results:
Understand when to harvest EXACTLY - 2-3 days makes a huge difference.  Learn proper storage conditions.  Prepare properly - perfectly good stuff can be ruined in minutes by poor prep.  That goes for seeds as well as whole pods.  

2.  Seeds - it was right in front of you all along.

Yes, poppy seeds are alkaloid covered wonders - unless they've already been washed thoroughly.  A point that Leon had been dying to share:  after consuming pounds and pounds of dried pods through the year, there is always a pile of seeds left at the bottom of the storage jars.  These are white, unripe seeds not what you find in the store , but consider that Leon reports that the tea made from the remaining seeds blows his mind to nearly uncomfortable itchiness and highs.  As the seeds ripen they obviously are still covered in goodness.

Leon says that store bought seeds can be highly effective, but to look for dark, dirty, and clumpy seeds.  Light blue seeds that flow freely like silica sand through an hourglass - CRAP!  Avoid anything from the EU.  Look for Turkey or any Middle Eastern origin.  Starting dosage for store seeds is 8 oz.  Know that peak onset can take 2.5 hrs and easily last into the following morning,

 3. Pills and fast acting pharmaceutical opiates.

Natural opiate metabolizes SLOWLY, which means the effect takes longer to feel, lasts longer when active, and wears off very slowly.

Pill type opiates act FAST, they are felt quickly, they only last an hour or two and they begin to wear off quickly.

Pills tend to encourage drug abuse because of their basic quick-hit nature.  Exercise extreme caution when taking both natural morphine from plant matter AND pill opiates.

Morphine has been used to overcome opiate pill addiction widely - because its strong, slow, and long lasting.  In other words: Morphine (the main pod ingredient) is satisfying.  Oxycodone is satisfying, said no one - EVER.

Leon reports that the withdraws after daily pill abuse are down right scary and at times seem impossible with panic, sweating, depression and psychosis.  The withdraws from PST use every 2-4 days is like having a light cold or allergy spell for a day or two.  Some other version of a hangover from too much drinking alcohol.

To be continued...

Questions and comments very welcome

( this was in the wrong subreddit before sorry)

A Method

Buy yourself a French press.  I have damn near worn mine out from making tea every week.

Snap the pods off 10 days after the flower petals drop.  In a mixed garden or large area think 50% of the petals off for 10 days.  Cut them in half horizontally.  Dry them in a food dehydrator on a low setting.  Properly done this will yield bright green crispy pods with a bonus - a nice little ring of dark black opium dried on the cut edge of every piece.

If they turn brown you are drying too hot, if they get spots or mildew you took too long between harvest and drying.  Keep them separate of they will spread mold to your entire batch.

Store them in jars like good bud and they will keep all year.

Heat enough water just for the press.  Hand crush (do not grind or powder) your dosage.  If you are new please start small, like 1\2 cup crushed in a batch.  Experienced users will want 3-6 cups crushed.  DANGER - these could be life threatening dosages if caution is not exercised.  Do not drink alcohol with this, you could stop breathing and die.

Also I have found some unlucky souls are seriously allergic to poppy tea.  Stomach cramping which turns into a painfully uncomfortable high and nausea a few hours after dosing.  Its like having a bad mushroom trip without the visuals.

Lemon juice 1/8th cup
Berry Zinger tea bags 2

Stop the heat just below boiling.  Add your crushed pods.  Wait and stir, wait and stir, repeat for 15 min.  This can be pressed right away and sweetened with honey.  You probably just made enough poppy tea for two people to enjoy high all night.

Instead of straining it right away - leave it warm but off the heat for an hour and the strength will proceed to nearly double.  If you're really patient, put it all in the French press and leave it (pressed down) overnight then stir it back up and repress.  It will kick your ass.

It keeps well in the fridge after pressing for 3-4 days ( don't store with sugar)

Have fun boys and girls!

I started taking Tramadol around 9 months ago (recreationally). Since then I used pretty much every day...I guess the average is 400mg a day but I've gone up and down, with an attempted taper or two.

About 4 weeks ago I got 75x 20mg Oxycontin. At that point I was tapering off Tramadol. After a couple of days I was on about 80mg avg Oxy... dropped the Tramadol for 4 days... and haven't done more than 200mg Tramadol since Oxy started.

On Friday I cut down - 50mg Tram, 80mg Oxy. Saturday 0 Tram, 40mg Oxy. I then went around 24 hours with nothing...by about 11pm last night I caved into the panic and RLS and had 1 20mg Oxy. It took the edge off but around 4 hours later I caved and had another. The RLS didn't go but it eased things slightly. I took St Johns Worts earlier that day...I've read that it greatly reduces the effectiveness of Oxy.

I want to get my body used to having less and less, until the WD symptoms are manageable and I have to tough it out from there cold turkey. I haven't enough to do a long taper. (about 10 pills left).

**tl;dr: if I have to cave into WD again, should I see if 50mg Tramadol gets me through...or stick to never having Tramadol again and try to get by on small irregular oxy doses instead?**

I am obviously zombie walking. Sometimes I will be in a store buying some random item or in a diner having coffee. Often I have mysterious bruises. Am I temporarily lobotomizing myself by shutting down my frontal lobe? Is this a tolerance issue? And finally , has anyone else had similar experiences mixing benzos and heroin?",1385963233.0

so i occasionally turn to the darknet for meds to make it through to my next appointment...and now i'm not sure where i'm going to turn with the giant clusterfuck that everything has become. i am not sure how i'm going to function at work, because my choices will be to go through wd now and feel like shit till my next appointment, or finish the script, then go through wd and possibly fail a UA (they don't always pop them on me, i had one last month so highly unlikely). i'm not proud of my decision to go about doing it this way, but i don't want to be kicked out of my treatment program for problems beyond my control...

ugh...i'm going to be purchasing a new small safe with my next good paycheck, hopefully one that doesn't require keyed entry, as i'm too paranoid that my key will be found if it's apparently that easy to find my medication...

1rv1ra,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1rv1ra/border_state_healthcare/,1,https://redd.it/1rv1ra,ImposterPreposterous,Border State Healthcare,"This is a blog post I made almost exactly a year ago. I thought you all might like it:

I followed the heroin dealer's directions and found the building more or less where he'd said I would, and more or less as he'd described it: yellow, with a sign reading ""Honduras"" over a secondary door. I think he actually said ""Nicaragua,"" but I reckoned it was close enough. Inside I saw a tall drink merchandiser, a folding card table with two middle aged middle american women sitting and talking in low tones, and a counter with an older mechanical cash register. I grabbed a mandarin Fanta from the cooler and walked to the counter. The nearest of the women stood up and gave the other a worried look as she made her way around me and behind the register.
 
!Buenos tardes! ?""Tienes Ampicilina?"" I asked. I had just left a friend's downtown wedding. I wasn't dressed as well as I should have been for the occasion, but I'd lay money that I was whiter and better dressed than anyone else who'd asked her this question before. 
 
She responded brightly, but the words slipped around my understanding. I only caught the syllable ""mox,"" while the rest of her speach blended into a collage of pitch and rhythm, her delightful Salvadoran accent contributing to a music that, by appreciating, I failed to comprehend. It was a pleasant moment, but I was immediately embarrassed, and stammered something in lame Tex-Mex about my Spanish being poor, and did she have any antibiotics?
 
The woman's face turned hard, and she stated curtly ""No tengo.""
 
""!Por favor, senora! Tengo dinero"" I plead, and began reaching for my wallet. The look of contempt on her face spoke volumes to me just then. She didn't give a damn about my money.
 
""You think I'm a cop."" I said, deadpan. She smiled a quirky smile and nodded.
 
""Necessito por me espossa."" I said, still fumbling in my wallet. I know my face communicated some of the pain of the last weeks to her. She softened immediately, and I felt the compassion that likely guided her into this line of work. Still, her answer remained the same. ""No tengo"" she again said. ""Nada.""
 
My fingers closed on my ancient green card. It was held together with a lamination of cellotape, deteriorated and dirty, and it plainly stated that it had expired back in 2005. I held it up for her to see, and once again said ""Por favor.""
 
I left with three packs of Amoxicillin: one for my diabetic wife with her poor wounded foot, one for my unemployed friend with an abscessed tooth, and the last for another friend, too prone to abscesses in his often punctured arms. ""Amoxicilina"" had been the word I'd almost grasped out of her first sentence to me. She tried to give me dosing instructions as I left, but it was clear that my Spanish was insufficient. I thanked her, grossly overpaid, and beat a hasty retreat. I wanted to assure her that I knew the appropriate dosage, and that I knew where to look learn all I needed to know about infection and treatment, but again, my Spanish was too weak to serve.
 
I drove north thinking about treatment resistant bacteria, about the efforts our society has made to ensure that these packets can only be obtained with a prescription and from a pharmacy. I thought about the financial barriers between me and my friends meeting those requirements, and how our situations, though common enough, are not so pressing or prevalent as to make antibiotics available to us easily outside the normal routes. How different, then, is it for the illegal immigrant laborers who live in this part of Dallas? These weren't sample packs - they were from a reputable Indian pharmacy, distributed in El Salvador and a few other Central American countries. The woman I bought them from was educated. The shop I found her in was like a little foreign aid camp. Like a Doctors Without Borders mission to a third world country, but right in the heart of Dallas. Are these antibiotics paid for by a church, I wonder? By a larger charitable organization? Is the demand for them so great that market forces alone make them available here? I don't know.
 
It is a strange America that we live in. Our society is not what I thought it was, growing up. ",1385933375.0

However, my friend gave me this Oxycontin and it seems to be able to take my pain and I've spoken to my doctor about it and he finally agreed to prescribe some to me after months of battling trying to explain my pain and that nothing else helps.

it's about that time again, that i take a good long break. this time though, i want to actually get clean and STAY that way.. which as you all know, is the most difficult part. i'm a heroin user, ROA being IV. i have about a .5g a day habit on my worst days. so not terrible, but i'm tired of being strung out all the time, constantly dope sick, and broke. if this is post is better suited for r/opiatesrecovery, then i'll head there but i feel more comfortable here.

anyway, my SO and i are attempting to taper down using less and less tar each day (sounds ridiculous i know). i really think it's going to work this time.. as much as i love getting high, i'm not happy anymore. i don't get a rush anymore, and now i'm just sticking a needle in my arm to stay well and feel normal. i want some normalcy back in my life.

my SO has commented before that i seem much more high-functioning on opiates, and i believe he's right. i'm less lazy, less lethargic, and more get-up-and-go when i'm high. i get a lot more done. but i'm sick of using, so i was considering getting on a suboxone maintenance program for a couple of months and see how i like it. not only would it prevent me from getting high by making dope useless, but i would still feel the energized way i do when using.

the questions i have i'm hoping i can get a few answers from you all. i'm worried that if i book this appointment and everything, if the bill would show up on my parent's accounts (they do online banking and such). i'm still on their insurance until i'm 24. i was under the impression that by law (or something) if you told the doctor to keep things confidential they would and my parents wouldn't know, but a while back i had gotten a pregnancy test at the doctor and my mother asked me about it even though i told the doctor i wanted it kept confidential. i would like to keep my privacy, it's very important as all of my family and friends now believe i've been clean for quite some time.

my second concern is, does it show up on a medical record? for example, in the future if i needed them would they no longer prescribe me narcotics or opioids of any kind? would i be prescribed ibuprofen for the rest of my life? because i don't want that.

i've heard great things about suboxone and i really want to give it a try to help me kick for good. (a loooong break. i can't be done with that sweet, sweet dope forever...)  there are no clinics or methadone clinics or even needle exchanges where i live, so a private in office doctor is the only way.

First off I walked in the room to find him nodded out with his face next to a plate with a couple of lines cut out on it. He never quit breathing and his breath wasnt even shallow. I was in the room with him until he woke back up and I repeat, never stopped breathing, not even close. So he wakes up a little disoriented, starts getting himself worked up, and starts Googling OD symptoms and convinces himself it just happened to him. Now I've been around, I've seen ODs, and even saw a girl get narcaned back to life. My friend did not OD. He has been on about a few week steady run on tar, he cuts it up with lactose powder to snort it, and never does more than .2 in a day. He whines a lot, including texting me that he is ""Dying"" while I'm out trying to cop, when its been less than 2 hours since his last line, the point being he is a stereotypical hypochondriac who is prone to exaggeration. Anyway, this whole episode did get me wondering what would you say the smallest dose of standard strength H be for someone to OD? I know there are a lot of factors in the equation, but I'm wondering what everyone's opinion is. My friend has a fairly low tolerance, but is by no means a total opiate rookie, he had a 70~100mg a day hydrocodone habit before he kicked that, now he has a small tar habit. Thoughts? Opinions?

Thoughts & advice?,"So I have a Sub (strip) and I'm curious what /r/opiates thoughts are. I am working towards getting cleanish (slowing down) and my last shot (Dilaudid 8mg) was 6-8 hours ago. I'm already pretty sick but as the Sub also has Naloxone (Narcan) in it I don't want to get thrown into withdraws when I take it. I mainline the strips and I'm only gonna do half of it tonight but sometimes the buprenorphine does not kick in exactly side by side with the naloxone so my worries is that the narcan will hit me before the buprenorphine does. If this happens does anyone know how long it takes for the bup to kick in via IV?

I know most will suggest against IV use of the strips. I agree. I'm sure it's not the best thing in the world but before they ever had sublinguals buprenorphine was injected.  (without all the extras from the strip tho im sure.) A lot of people I know here also IV them. I am completely unable to put them under my tongue for longer than 10 seconds before I throw it up. Was put on these when i was kicking a bad heroin habit few years ago and it totally ruined them for me. Even the smell of the strips makes me nauseous.

Good and Bad news.  I hurt my back over the years playing sports, and working labor jobs.  It has been getting worse every year, and unfortunately it has become nearly unbearable in the recent months. My job is physical, and my current state of pain makes it awful some days, but I must work. I always avoided doctors, because being young I assumed there was no chance of getting help as far as pain meds go.  I've been given steroids, muscle relaxers, and a lot of dirty looks, so I just gave up.  I always had my IV heroin anyway, which was fine for years, but I want to be more legit now. I haven't done heroin since march, and oxys from the street are such a ripoff, and not nearly as good.  

I got my MRI report, and the doctor was suddenly so much more respectful upon telling me there is a serious tear, and that it's certainly the cause for my severe pain.  He recommended me to a back specialist, and will provide a recommendation for me wherever I'd choose to go he said.  Where do I go from here?  The bad news is my back is seriously fucked up, but the good news is I now have proof of it, and a doctor willing to back me up.   I want to play this right.  So...those with experience in this realm, what would you say is the best course of action now?  Pay it slow and safe is what I'd guess.

To start: this is gonna be long, there is no dope/pill porn below, and the post is overall kind of somber, so if you're buzz is killed easily maybe just skip this one.  But I definitely could use some support and appreciate any and all you can muster up :)

I used to post here quite often under another name, and at that time I was pretty much a full blown junkie. I HAD to use every day just to function, and I spent pretty much all day every day figuring out ways to hustle a bag or two up, which usually involved driving people who had more money than me direct to the spot for a few bags. I saved them a couple hours on the train, I get high..win win, right?

Except it got old, fast.  I started having a LOT of trouble finding veins, and unless the dope was EXCEPTIONALLY good, I pretty much never got high-just ""well."" 

From almost the second I started IVing, my dad caught on (I was living at home at the time) and became quite ""observant."" So besides going through all of this trouble and barely getting high, I was getting berated daily by my poor parents who were watching their son kill himself.

I got on suboxone and somehow convinced my folks I had stopped using, when in reality I was kind of ""cycling"" on and off sub.  I'd go anywhere from 3 days to 3 months without touching dope, but whenever I had a surplus of funds, I'd dive right back into it. My non-using friends had also confronted me, and I was lying to them too-telling all of them I was on the sub and never intended to touch dope again. I was living a huge lie.

I ended up moving across the country at the beginning of the summer, as I was offered a job in a city I've always wanted to live in.  The worst part of the city, and what finally motivated me to quit FOR REAL, was the dope. (Another thing that massively sucked-my job fell through. Long story and not really relevant, except for the fact that I'm spending my retirement money to get by right now.) I thought it was tough getting a nod off of primo brooklyn powder-not even close. Those of you who are hooked on the east coast, count your lucky starts that you don't have to deal with tar. It is NASTY stuff, and any miss at all results in a near immediate abscess.  I became ""that guy"" who was forced into wearing long sleeves in 105 degree heat because my arms were positively FUCKED.  I finally decided enough was enough, but I knew I subs didn't work for me. All they did for me was keep me from being physically ill, but I still felt like utter shit the entire time I was on it. 

So, I decided to go on mdone. The clinic I'm at is fantastic. When you first come in, they EXPECT you to use, as they can only dose you 30mg due to state law. You're encouraged to get clean at your own pace, and never punished for your honesty. This was crucial to my truly cleaning up my act, and for the last couple of months, I was being PRETTY damn good. My one ""cheat"" was every other Saturday, when I'd get my take home for Sunday, I'd take one and a half my dose to get a little buzz on, then would just tough out half a dose on Sunday. Mdone has such a long half life that it's actually quite easy to skip a day or two..I believe w.d. doesn't start until day 3 or 4. So, this past saturday, I said fuck it, and I doubled down on my dose. Just chugged my take home when I got home from dosing on Saturday. I probably would've been fine if I just had a chilled out day, but I got a phone call at about 2pm-one of my friends from college was in town, for one day only..out of the blue. He had just proposed to his GF and they were so excited they decided to drive from New Orleans to Austin, since this is where they met a few years ago.

And as tends to happen with ole college buds, I got tanked. I've got a pretty decent alcohol tolerance, but the double mdone definitely contributed to me being entirely too drunk by bedtime. 
I woke up on Sunday feeling like absolute TRASH, and I knew I had no mdone. Now, I wasn't in w.d., but no matter how bad you're feeling, your daily dose of mdone does perk you up a bit. There is no denying that.  And without it, I was weak. The thought popped into my head-""just call up the man, just this one time."" I tried to dismiss it, but it kept getting louder and louder. You all know how this ends-with me cooking up some shitty tar and putting it into my arm. 

I felt HORRIBLE about it almost immediately. It was like prep, shot, rush, guilt, all within 2 minutes. All I've been focusing on for the last 2 months was not using-to the detriment of pretty much everything else, but hey-I was ""Clean""-and now I wasn't. 
I went in yesterday and seriously considered telling my counselor that I used, but when she greeted me with a jovial ""what's up? How was your weekend?,"" for some reason I responded with ""great!"" And that was it. I was clammed up-I couldn't admit to my counselor that I had failed.  She had just seemed so proud of me for how well I had been doing, and I wasn't ready to admit my fuck up. I go home after dosing, feeling pretty guilty, and eat about a pint of ice cream and pass out. I wake up, it's dark out, fuck it, I'm drinking then going back to bed. (I usually only drink about once every two weeks-just for context) I had a bottle of wine left over from Turkey day, and I powered thru that while watching the Saints get de-STROYED by the Seahawks. I was ready to call it a night, when I get a text-""hey, I'm right down the street. You need?"" 

It was my ""guy""-and he texted me at just the right (by right I mean wrong) time. I'm drunk, my guard is down. Fuck it, just one more time, I already fucked up, might as well. I had just happened to take 100 out of the ATM when I went to get gas so I could pay the mdone clinic today-I guess I'll just use that. Yea, I'll take a G. Fucker delivered it right to me, and I split it up into 3 shots. I was giddy-looking back on it, I want to cry, but at the time, drunk me was psyched.  I actually got a decent rush out of the first shot. I passed out for a bit, then woke up around 3am, still drunk, and did another. This time, no rush at all. It was like I just threw 35 bucks down the toilet. Passed out again, wake up at 830am, hungover as FUCK. I do the last of the dope just because I want it gone, I don't want to see it anymore. Like I predicted, I didn't even get a rush. Then I went to the clinic, and didn't even make eye contact with anyone there. I felt like such a scumbag, but it would've been even worse if I didn't show up at all.  And once again, I couldn't bring myself to admit my weakness.

Now, I'm just fucking hating myself. I am no position financially to be dropping a hundo on a Monday night. I can NOT go back to shooting dope-I'll be back living with my parents before I fucking know it. I actually have a great job prospect here, I have a FOURTH interview coming up with a company that really takes it's time in the interview process. And I'm fucking it all up.

I have zero desire to use right now, but I'm scared of what's gonna happen when it comes back. I have pretty much no support network outside of my mdone counselor.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I have plenty of people who care about me-but I'm too weak to reach out to them now. I absolutely can NOT tell my parents or friends I slipped-they wouldn't understand.  They do not grasp the permanent nature of addiction, and think it was just a fluke thing and I'm back to the guy who would never DREAM of doing dope.

That's why I'm here.  In the past, when I was struggling, some people from here really stepped up and I had some great ""phone support."" That was a couple of years ago, and 2 phones ago, so I've lost touch with them. I know I need to get to meetings and all that, but I want to start smaller, with something more manageable, and I've always felt that there is a decent contingent of good, caring people here who actually give a shit about people besides themselves.

To sum it up: I need a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to, who I can be completely honest with. If you want to do it via PM, that's cool, I'm fine with texting, and actually calling me is fine too. If you'd like to lend me a hand, just drop a line. I'd really appreciate it.  And to everyone else, thanks for even reading this. I know there are plenty of other people going through the same exact struggle I am-keep your head up. That's what I'm telling myself, anyway.",1386094936.0

I'm addicted and dependant but trying to rapidly taper as of Saturday.

I started Oxycontin a month ago....Avg 120-140mg a day. When I first started Oxy, I went for 4 or 5 days without Tramadol...and I haven't done a full 400mg of Tramadol since getting Oxy. 

I don't understand why I didn't suffer withdrawal after the days without Tramadol, as I understand it has fundamentally different properties while acting as an SNRI. 

This isn't long enough to take PAWS into account... but I would imagine 4/5 days is enough to see some kind of physical withdrawal or was the Oxycontin providing enough distraction for me to not realise I'm in WD. 

Has anybody had any experience or knowledge on this?

I'm on a rapid taper since Saturday, determined to quit, nobody knows and I guess I'm using these opportunities to reach out and communicate, while understanding the situation I got myself into. It's very selfish in a way, but I appreciate any replies.

Skip to the bottom for my questions,"Hey r/opiates, I'm kind of new on this sub and so I'll introduce myself first. You can call me Jay.  I have been on opiates for almost 2 years now and am currently taking about 160mg of oxy a day (all I can afford, well I say afford loosely)  it gets quite expensive. It all started about 2 summers ago when my aunt who is a nurse ran out of her percocet script and she came to me to get her some pills ( I grew up in a rough town and had many people I could go to, she's a suburbanite who knew no one) I didn't think she was an addict as she told me she hated asking and she only needed them because she misplaced her meds and couldn't locate them(a lie because I found out a while later her doc took her off them and she was sick), now, I had never even done drugs besides a little weed here and there but was open and had many friends who had connections so instead of watching her suffer I decided I'd be a good nephew and get her pills. It took no time at all before I found Vicodin, 20 mins? Well she gave me the cash and I bought some, she thanked me and I thought that was the end of it....

Wrong, gradually she started asking me to get more and more stating that her script was discontinued and her doctor was being mean about it. Because she was my aunt and a medical professional I trusted her that she really was still in so much pain( she cried and swore she was) I continued helping. 

Well, I have a long history of soft enamel and bad teeth so I had multiple broken teeth and cavities that would hurt time to time but ibuprofen would usually sort it out. At least until one day when I hit my face against my front steps after tripping and broke 2 teeth. I tried taking ibuprofen but it wasn't working and living with my aunt, she heard me crying in my room. She came in and checked me out and offered to give me a Vicodin. Now, I wasn't into being high, even weed wasnt ""fun"" I didn't like it that mich and did it only a handful of times. I hated drugs and tried to stay away from them.( I saw friends lives ruined over crack and Meth before) I declined her offer but after about 20 more mins of unbearable pain I caved and took one.

MY GOD! this was nothing like weed (weed always makes me feel nauseous) it was like god himself held my hand and smiled into my soul. I was happy and felt no pain. After that I went back to taking my usual ibuprofen but something started happening, every time I had a toothache and asked for ibuprofen my aunt would insist on taking Vicodin instead. ""It works better"" "" the pain will go away for sure"" ""trust me, I wouldn't do anything that would hurt you"" ""I know what I'm doing"" now, I don't believe in blaming others for your addiction, you CHOSE to do it as well, no matter the  pressure but something has to be said about the trust I had in my aunt who is family, and the fact that she was an RN and her job was literally making pain stop I had an unbreakable trust in her.

It wasn't long before I was taking them every day. I had a deal with her where I would go get them and she would buy for both of us (sweet deal looking back) but eventually I started getting less and less and less. I didn't know what was happening but I couldn't get even a little happy off of 5 pills at a time! I couldn't even get that many now! My aunt explained that we needed stronger stuff and that's the day I realized I was a drug addict.

Over time she became less and less generous. She would buy a lot 300-400 worth every few days and only give me a couple of the pink Roxi supply I secured.  I finally felt what withdrawal was and I hated it, her, everything for making this happen. We began fighting about it until I wised up and realized I could simply overcharge her, after all, she had a shit ton of money and I felt it was all her fault I was sick and wasn't gonna take it anymore. This went on for a while, she was so rich and bad off in pills that I was charging her more than twice the amount and she didn't bat an eye. Things were good again, I had all the pills I wanted and even had more than she did, and it was justified!....so I thought.

She found out. She stole my phone off of my nightstand one morning and took my contacts (she knew names) I found out immediately because she stopped asking me to go. She was buying more than ever and I was getting zero. My connections betrayed me because of money. That was the worst because to keep them quiet and not telling me what she was doing she paid them extra.. a lot extra. Why would she pay them that when she could be paying me? I had gotten greedy..I wasn't me anymore.  I had a reality check and realized I couldn't completely blame her for my addiction. Nor can I blame her for not financing my habit. I do still feel like she is responsible for some of it. I trusted her and feel like she wanted someone to use with her(misery loves Company?) Maybe I'm wrong I just don't know. 

Things were bad. I left. I worked but to afford my own was more than difficult . Pretty soon I found a dealer who basically laughed at me when I asked for Vicodin or roxi. after a couple of times she turned me on to OPs. This is when I graduated. I have been up and down with how much I  take. I am at a point that its costing way too much to do. I now have a fiancée and daughter to worry about (they were there the whole time at my aunts too but we were now paying bills in our own apartment ) I am on my own. My fiancée knows nothing about my addiction. I have no one to turn to for help in what I need to do. I can't afford rehab and I don't have time for the program my city offers. I would have to be there for 3 hours ever day in the am but my job is a set schedule that I can not alter. 

The point of this thread is to tell my story and I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense. I am tired, sick, and on mobile.

I want to also ask, what do you guys pay for OPs? I think my dealer is gouging me. I am charged $40 a pill for OP 80s. I have a lady who will sell me some for 30 but that's still expensive at 2 pills a day. I don't know what to do because I literally can not afford it anymore, my family is suffering financially because of me and my house of cards is about to collapse. I have about 5 methadone that I'm wondering about taking to try and quit but I'm not well versed on any of this.

I need help and I am hoping you guys can, if there's anyone who knows how I feel its you guys. 

Some more info. I have gathered that the pills I take are referred to as oxyneo. People say there was a different type before these that was crushable, I don't snort them, I take them orally. I cut them into quarters most of the time but I've heard that they aren't meant to be broken up. Am I stupid for how I take them?

Anyone here ever get headaches after nodding out? More specifically, after smoking tar? I'm usually a casual oral oxy user but I got some tar and said why not. Smoked some yesterday(.4 split between 3 sessions, about 3-4 hour a apart) I didn't really nod nod or anything but I did get high.

Fast forward to 11am today, smoke a point with my coffee, go about my day. Smoke another point at around 330, continue my day. Then when I get home(630ish) I smoke about .2, take one hit of some marijuana and have a single beer(I like this combo the best for most opiates). Needless to say I nod in n out for like an hour and a half then eventually pass out for about an hour and a half. I then wake up, stand up and get a very sharp piercing headache. I immediately take two Tylenol and drink some water. 15 minutes later it dampens it, I take another Tylenol and more water, it gets rid of it mostly. However I can kinda still feel it a liiiittle bit. 

So sorry for the lpmg story just wanted to include any important details. Anyone else ever face this? Should I be worried? I never ever get headaches so this is why I figured it was linked with the H. Thanks guys!",1386241278.0

Yesterday I met up with a buddy of mine who met a guy who could get some fire dope. I bought a half gram of some straight white vinegar smelling powder and immediately did a 50mg test shot. This got me high. I have a relatively low tolerance because I try to take regular breaks to ensure I don't form a physical addiction (been there done that killed myself a couple times and don't wana go down that road again) anyways this dope was fire. Not the best I've had but certainly above average. That night after I did my 3Rd shot I had a huge wave of nausea barfed everywhere and haven't been able to hold food down since. (Haven't quit doing shots though either)


This is just strange to me. I usually never get sick and can generally eat even if on dope. I don't know what's causing this so here I am in search of a more educated person to enlighten me on why these side effects are happening to me.

On top of whatever of whatever opiod I choose, there are 4 other skeletal/muscle relaxers that I have to take on top of them.

They give and fill prescriptions for both of the above, and then give me a choice as to which I will use.

I switched to the patch about 3 months ago and found that the timed release through the day was better than the ups and downs of the pills, however when I recently decided to try dropping the patch and going back to the pills for a bit, withdrawal hit me like a ton of bricks. I was a non functioning human being for 24 hours while I waited for the next patch to take effect.

One of the reasons I was looking at dropping the patch is I have had severe weight loss since starting it.  I'm 6'3"" and weighed 185 when I started, however as of this morning I am 157.

I don't know for sure that the the buprenorphine is causing the weight loss, but the timing matches  So I thought I would ask if anyone else is aware of a link between weight loss and buprenorphine.

Under closer examination these M box's have some obvious things wrong, for one the color is a light blue instead of the regular almost white color of the M's. Another thing is they feel too thin, regular M's were always a little fatter than A's and V's and this looks more like the size and color of an A but with an M stamped on it. The 30 imprint looks almost too clean and they feel really tough to the touch, they almost wont even break up when trying to crush them.

And by a few I mean ""so problematic it wasn't worth the risk"". Here's a few tips to maintain a good relationship if you have a good dealer you intend to keep. Feel free to expand.

1. Your dealer is likely not a Pakistani national. Do not call at 3 in the morning unless you know they are cool with it. If you buy your morning junk the night before, this becomes a non-issue.

2. Cars have several seats for a reason. Do not lead a convoy to your Dealer's. If you do, at least make your final moments of life entertaining with CB radios. So maybe the LE can just go ahead and tune in, too. Dumbass.

3. They are not Pawn Stars. Do not arrange something and bring your bike as collateral. Or your grandpa's coins or the bridemaid's dress you tucked the tag into during a wedding. Yes, this happened.

4. They are not magicians. They will let you know when they reup as they likely want the money as bad as you want the shit. Do not text/call/drive by incessantly. It's fucking creepy. 

5. Don't hang out unless they're your friend. In which case that's a bad idea because they will fuck you over or vice versa. Which leads me to 

6. Not every rip off is punishable by death. Sometimes you have to let shit go and move on to whiter/blacker/browner/khaki pastures. Or go ahead and regulate. Get rowdy like your family's drunken redneck overly-aggressive Thanksgiving touch football. Fights begin, cops are called, fingerprints are taken, days are lost, bail is made, court dates are ignored, cycle is repeated. But no death, this is not Singapore.

7. Do not try to buy drugs in Singapore.",1386292789.0

Or is it pretty much awful from the start? What's the time frame for physical addiction (if any)- I.e. how often do you have to use to keep withdrawals at bay? Or does this also vary? 

Finally, any helpful tips or techniques that I should be aware if I choose to take a break for a bit? Or the other end of the spectrum- what to expect if I keep using, and if anyone has any hints/ tips or generally useful information that you wish you knew when you started using a lot?

I'd like to tell you guys my story and I invite you to tell yours if you'd like or just to give some advice. Anything, really, is welcome here in my thread. :)

So I've been on the stuff again for a few weeks now. This must be something like my 10th or so streak. Each lasting from a week up to 6 months. 

I have had to accept that I do not really get high anymore. Even on the first days of a streak. The high is not what it once used to be and neither are the withdrawals. Everything has changed.

This drug is starting to bore me. Even the thrill of finding new suppliers is not nearly as fun as it once was. I recently got a new source which allowed me to purchase 50 grams at a price of 20EUR/27.4USD a gram. This stuff goes for 50-60 (68.5-82.2) a gram on the street. Pictured in the photo are about 5 grams of this. The color is a dark, almost reddish, brown.

Nonetheless I do not really enjoy getting high anymore. Quite on the contrary: Getting this massive amount of dope seems to have made the whole situation even worse, since it has robbed me of the thrill and excitement that comes with the daily hunt for dope. 

In the end though, this might be exactly what I need. This might be the final chapter to my dope adventure. This revelation might finally be what will set me free. Maybe after this streak I will at last be done with this drug.

Posting on an alt since I don't exactly want this post on my main...I'll try and keep it short, but I want to give as much pertinent information as possible so the people who'd like to help can give reasonable answers.

**Background Info:**
I found out late tonight that I'll be getting drug tested tomorrow morning by **my family.** I used IV heroin tonight and have used for the past 3 days. Before that I had between 2 and 3 weeks clean. 

I have been tested by my family somewhat regularly for the past month or two, but I always got lucky and got the test when I had  3+ days clean.

What they do is they use one of the standard 5-panel urine tests that you can buy from CVS/Walgreens. 60% of the time my dad will stand in the bathroom with me (maybe 10 feet away and with his back either fully turned or looking at himself in the mirror unable to see my nuts etc) while the other 40% of the time they just give me the test and tell me to go do my thing. 

Another item to note is that to this day they haven't handled the sample. After I urinate I leave the bathroom with my sample and put the paneled strip inside. They'll usually watch this portion of the test to see the result, and to make sure I'm doing it properly. After I pull the test strip out of the urine sample they read the verdict and then prompt me to pour the sample into the toilet (I think it's important to reiterate that they have not once touched the sample cup...yet...). 

**Dilemma & Question:** 

The dilemma is fairly obvious. I'd like to try and pass the test tomorrow morning when I wake up. Here's some final info on some of the ""tools"" I have to aid in this process. 

- My own clean urine (don't know 100% that it's clean but I pissed w/ 15 days sober - I have always pissed clean after about 65-70 hours)

- Condoms...lol

- Two forms of bleach (sodium hypochlorite in liquid and salt form)

- And obviously lots of water

So r/opiates, what say you? What would you do in my position given the info provided to give you the best shot at passing. I think it's clear that using my own clean urine is best, however I can't guarantee that a family member won't watch closely this time, etc.

I know we get lots of posts on how to pass drug tests, etc. But I thought that in my case since I have a significant amount of information & detail that we might be able to come to some sort of semi-consensus on what gives the best chance.

If you made it this far you're a fucking lunatic and I love the shit out of you. I really would be grateful for any and all responses.

TL;DR - Found out 5-panel home drug screen tomorrow by parents. They rarely come in w/ me and have yet to ever hold the sample of urine. No labs ever either. I used tonight and have my own clean urine that I just saved from the other day as well as bleach, condoms, etc. What should I do?

EDIT - it's likely I won't have the ability to go anywhere to acquire other items between now and test time (roughly 4-5 hours from now). So try and pick a solution w/ the things provided. If you think it's absolutely critical then post a comment and I can try to go to a store, or wherever. ",1386413877.0

Don't get me wrong I appreciate the people who did write, but if you guys care more about the person who saw a fucking cat while shooting up than the guy needing help with injecting, then what is the fucking point of this subreddit anyways. Me and cat person posted at nearly the same time, his post shoots to the top, but my important question is barely touched. This is bullshit, this is supposed to be a community focused on harm reduction, but few people bothered to help me. I am so disappointed in this sub right now! Can someone please at least help me now???

Halfway through the shot, I fell out of the vein, lost <5 units around the injection site. It stung for a while and rose up into a red bump with mild inflammation spreading about half an inch in each direction. So I need to know, is this just gonna leave a mark, or is there a possibility of having more serious complications.

EDIT: The point is why the fuck should I bust my ass trying to help people and reduce harm for everyone else with my specialized knowledge in Med Chem if noone is gonna return the favor. This is what pisses me off. If I see something like that that I can answer, I always comment. Especially if there is a possibility that harm could be done. This is what upset me mostly. This isn't the first novel post that has been completely ignored either.

EDIT2: I appologize for being hostile especially to GGNN, but my post was not nearly as bad ask everyone is saying. You all are over reacting and trashing me much harder than I ever trashed the community. I just reread my post and have no idea why you all have been so mean to me. I didn't trash ANYBODY in my post why so HOSTILE? I only started trashing GGNN because he told me I was whining like a girl for posting this. I don't get it guys, you all act like I wrote something that offends the community, my post isn't half as bad as the other guy who posted negatively about this subreddit. Thanks to everyone that was reasonable and helped me, I guess I had to make a more visable post, because once you a think I am offending you, everyone runs to help YAY! But seriously, I didn't make a threat, I am just trying to make a point. I feel like I have gave much more to this community than I have received. It just really pissed me off because I was in a drug deprived state and couldn't get the help I needed to fix this. I just really though people would try to help me with my legitimate question. I was very hurt when noone did. I wasn't actually angry at anyone till everyone came here and started trashing me. Whatever guys this is bullshit.

I feel completely betrayed. I thought we all were friends. You won't have to worry about replying to a post from me again.


It's so funny that you are all pissed at me for overreacting, but you all overreacted to my post MUCH MORE than I ever overreacted. Wtf happened to the kindness and friendship in this community.

I'm absolutely certain it isn't too much, because its 60% of the dose I need to not get sick. I have only one syringe. I have a few microgram filters lying around and would much rather use them than cotton. The problem is, the filter attachment won't fit an insulin syringe. It will fit an unopened oral syringe I have though. Here is what I was thinking about doing:



Get a water bottle. Take some water from it and dissolve the heroin inside the bottle cap. Suck the heroin through the filter into the oral syringe. Now here is the tricky part. I guess I should transfer the solution from the oral syringe to the insulin syringe without contaminating the solution. Should I just stick the syringe needle into the oral syringe and suck out the liquid if possible? Now I just need to wrap a belt around my arm and stick the needle into a visable vein slowly at about 15-20 degree. Then I need to register some blood to make sure I have the vein correctly. Then I should be good to just push it in?


Let me know if I have anything wrong in my procedure. Yes I know, I shouldn't be doing this alone. But fuck it I don't know ANYBODY (well I know one guy 50 miles away) that IVs.

I have tried psychedelics more, mostly just weed, MDMA, LSD, shrooms, and a few different stimulants. My DOC is weed and coffee by far. This is my first time snorting something.

It was nice. I think that's about it. A small body high and mind high. That nod. Very relaxing, slightly uncoordinated. The unfortunate side effect is that I became rather drowsy, so I drank some coffee and ate an armodafinil after about 2 or 3 hours after the first line. (That wasn't a moronic decision right?) I don't pump, so that's why I chose the nasal route. It was certainly relaxing and enjoyable, but I think if i was given the choice between weed and Opana, I would choose weed. I suppose that is just personal preference, would you make the same choice? (Although, I can assume this answer is a universal no in /r/opiates, right?)

It was a pleasurable experience, but I don't think I would actively try this again. If I got offered I don't think I'd turn it down, but that all depends on the situation. If you have the chance to try this drug, I would recommend it, but just be mindful about abuse.

I got his number and said I'd hit him up over the weekend, finally texted him this morning and got replies every ~20 minutes along the lines of ""hey we still on, you still want this?"", ""this is straight 10/10 stuff!"" - should have been a big warning sign but I really wanted him to be legit, and I knew he was on Mdone so he must have had something to do with the game...  
So we meet, he seem nice enough, asks me why I don't score local, I said because it's normally shit, something which he agreed to.  
Got home, opened the bags and smelt chocolate powder. Great. I sent him a text saying if it wasn't safe to shoot say now and we'd call it done, that I didn't want to loose an arm over it.  
20 seconds later (after putting on water & heat) it was obviously trash, but he actually texted me saying ""yea it's chocolate"".

That in itself is pretty daft, but what just seems so stupid to me is that I know where to find him, the pharmacy know him, he has to go there every day, I have a stream of texts off him offering to sell me drugs... and he ripped me off.  
I told him that, saying for £20 it wasn't worth the hassle, but that he had to be pretty fucking dumb to pull that shit, and then the fun started.

He starts getting real angry when I text him, so naturally, having no gear and being £20 down, I replied a few more times, each one getting it's own, special little bundle of illiterate rage.

That tis the question.,"Quick background, I've posted here before but this is a new account for real life privacy issues. Lurked here for about 3 years over the course of a progressively intensifying Oxy addiction. The last 6 months of which peaked at about 300-450mg a day both IV and intranasal. I always did both for personal preference reasons. I also supplemented my roxy habit with dope often. Got sober at the beginning of August, was clean almost 4 months and then had a one night relapse recently of 150mg roxy. It was nice.

So basically it was suppose to be a ""one night thing"" but I'm changing the plans. I want to get high. I really am going to try to keep it to one night binges every other week or so. I still go to outpatient treatment and get drug tested once a week. So duh I'll just use right after my tests. This plus limited funds at the moment should keep this plan on course. I accept the fact this is a slippery slope and I'm ok with it.

Now my question. I would like serious opinions and discussion about the pros and cons of dope vs oxy given the context of my situation. Money is tight. We are talking 30mg roxies at $30 each from a reliable connect vs ECP at $10 a bag(have not sampled but the guy said its fire and 4 months ago his shit  was like a 6 on the 10 scale). I would probably have $80-$150 to use for these binges. I want the most bang for my buck(pun intended). 5 blues did fuck me up the other night but I did them all within 4 hours, then wanted more. I didn't IV them because I'm scared to overdose because of the clean time. I nearly lost my life last winter and in the time I was clean it really sunk in. But I'm daydreaming about pushing off. Opinions on doing this safely is also appreciated. I'm leaning toward the H but I have this irrational fetish with blues.

Never saw any stamp bags too, we measure our stuff with straws or transparent baggies. The pricing is actually very decent, our 4g bag is 50-70usd and 8g bag is 90-120usd

I need advice on how to best minimize this harsh ordeal ill soon be facing.

1sf8ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1sf8ax/stages_of_od_and_a_little_narcancpr_information/,71,https://redd.it/1sf8ax,srblows,Stages of OD and a little Narcan/CPR information for you guys. Since many have asked what OD'ing is like.,"Essentially to give you a stages of OD based on low dose->high dose 1 being lower dose (not severe OD):

1.  Nodding off, slow respirations, remaining conscious
2.  Nodding off, slower respirations, staying unconscious for longer periods of time or only alert/able to wake by stimulation (pain or someone yelling at you, slapping you, etc)
-  At this stage if you have an easily obstructing airway (ie you snore at night, or require a CPAP machine, or have a very full neck/chin)  then you can obstruct your airway and block your ability to breathe still while semi-conscious or unconscious but you should be responsive to stimulation especially painful stimulation.  Your respirations will probably be around 4 breaths per minute at this stage and if you don't have an easily obstructing airway you will continue breathing even if unconscious, just slowly and could wake up with a respiratory acidosis which will cause you to hyperventilate automatically once you are alert to bring your CO2 down (it goes up with lower respiratory rate it's your bodies natural response).  This is the stage of people who have OD'd and lost conscious but woke up OK.
4.  You nod off, stay unconscious and can only be awaken by extremely painful stimulation or you will remain unconscious even with stimulation.  At this stage your breathing will be VERY slow or you won't be breathing at all, i.e. at most 1 breath per minute, probably more like 1 breath per several minutes or not at all.  You will be unconscious and require ventilation.  At this stage your blood oxygen content will gradually get lower and lower (depending on if you're breathing at all) and you will turn blue and eventually lose pulse.  If you do not get resuscitation or narcan soon at this stage your blood O2 saturation will get low enough that you will eventually develop cardiac instability (Ventricular tach then Vfib, then asystole, or sometimes just bradycardia-> asystole) and death.  

The longer you are down at this stage the less likely someone will be able to revive you.  A patient who has completely lost O2 saturation and pulse will need CPR (chest compressions) first and require ventilation.  

If patient is young and healthy and loses complete O2 saturation and pulse, even if asystolic for short periods of time (minutes) usually resuscitation is possible.  If down for longer than 10 minutes, especially longer than 30 minutes, resuscitation is unlikely.

At any of these stages Narcan will be effective in reversing the issue.  IV narcan is the best option.  If pulses are already lost then ones best option is a vein close to the heart such as the external jugular (or internal jugular or subclavian if you are really good) and chest compressions must be conducted to get the drug there as well as keep the heart pumping.  IM Narcan is an option if you can't hit a vein quickly however it will take longer to kick in and is very unlikely to work if the person has lost pulses, so go for a vein or wait for EMT's.

I've seen IV narcan take as long as 3-4 minutes to work in a patient with good cardiac function.  It will take much longer if you are doing chest compressions.  

Base your Narcan dose on the respiratory rate (count how many times per minute you see the chest rise and fall).  If the patient isn't breathing at all, start HIGH i.e. at least 1mg IV.  If the patient is breathing at least 3 breaths per minute even if not responsive you can start with as little as .25 to .5 mg Narcan.  I generally also dilute my Narcan with a little water, but it will depend on what kind of syringe you are using.  

Once the dose is given, as long as there are pulses: wait, it takes a few.  Watch the respiratory rate (chest rise), because the OD victim may not wake up instantly (especially if a lower dose is used).  As long as the patient is breathing >4 breaths per minute then you are fairly in the clear.  They will wake up eventually if you used enough Narcan, if you didn't you can always wait a bit and use more.

In steps of importance as soon as you see the patient go unconscious:  

1. Try yelling at them (stimulation) if they are not awake, if no response then stimulate them with pain to see if they wake or start breathing.  Best way for that is sternal rub (take your fist and rub as hard as you can in the center of the chest), or jaw thrust (thumbs behind the back of the lower portion of the jaw) PULL HARD, you will not usually dislocate the jaw.  If responsive to pain Narcan may not be necessary, or a small dose is fine.

2.  If no response especially to pain count respirations and give Narcan if you have it, call 911 either way (please) but your choice if you have narcan, watch respirations in further painful stimulation (keep trying).  If patient turns blue you can try mouth to mouth but I would not recommend it.  Just keep checking pulses until responder's are there (if pulses are lost start chest compressions)

http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/CPRAndECC/HandsOnlyCPR/Hands-Only-CPR_UCM_440559_SubHomePage.jsp#

American Heart recommends hands only, however now as of 2013 they are changing the language to read ""if you want to do the old method of 30 compressions 2 breaths then YOU CAN"" lol, such a cop out.  

Please do not do chest compressions on a victim unless pulses are lost.  Mouth to mouth is your own business, know it is not recommended for non-trained CPR because it can cause stomach contents to be regurgitated and aspirated which will put the victim at risk of yet another possibly fatal condition aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.  

TLDR;  Try painful stimulus first, measure breaths per minute, if breathing with pulses DO NOT DO CPR, Narcan can be used whenever, however if patient is breathing it can be used in low doses, high doses for victims that don't need them will cause instant withdrawal and psychosis can be an issue.  If you want to kiss your buddy to give him breaths, now American Heart says you shouldn't be they don't give a fuck if you do apparently.  NOT ALL OD's even involving loss of consciousness are life-threatening, LOOK FOR BREATHING.  ",1386548696.0

After hearing a story from her friend, my mom decided to ransack my room because she thought I still might be using. She flipped everything and cleaned it, she found stuff I didn't even know was there... but she didn't find the dope... all 5g's of it, 2 of which being someone else's that needs to pick up today. 

I flipped shit and told her the syringes were for me helping the community to distribute (or sell) them cheaply so junkies were practicing safe use and all that shit. She also found a narcan syringe that was used because I saved my fiance's life on Thursday. 

Anyways... I lost everything except for my dope, and around 50 syringes and a thing of cotton. I was screaming and yelling and telling her to fuck off. She leaves and I was pissed so I asked my fiance to make a shot. So while she''s cooking... she comes back home and BANG BANG BANG BANG loud as fuck on the door. She pops the lock but is so fucking stupid she doesn't see my fiance cooking but instead see's me fidgeting with some HCL powder. I jump to the door and shut it, I yell THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE, THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE. 

I come back in and the cookers are still fucking there! I casually rushed over and poured the liquid onto the floor :( and said ""oh these?"" ""they're fucking trash! I'm cleaning the shit you missed so you can leave me alone!"" She proceeds to re ransack my room. She finds the 2.5 g bag I had brought with me that do to work in my roadie pouch. She says ""What's this?"" and I snatch it out of her hands. Got it back. 

Anyways I started flipping out and I punched 10 holes in my wall and broke a fucking stud. Yeah I know, how alpha of me! 

I confess that I'm doing dope, but say I'm not using needles and that when I told her I was selling the needles I was telling the truth. I want to leave, I had to sacrifice everything to come live with her. I seriously destroyed my life, and fucked my dad over (even though he's a piece of shit also) just to help my mom. 

A normal mother wouldn't ransack her 20 year old sons bedroom. Or maybe they would. But a normal mother would leave when their son is screaming to leave (me) alone. She just fucking stood there. So I finally get her to leave after 30 minutes of her standing there, and I just did a shot. My fiance got so scared she left to her grandmas. I just called my dad, he's on the way. I plan to confess my use to him so we can get along again. I've been lying saying I'm clean to look like the better man, but I realized my mom is a crazy cunt and he was right to have done the things he did. I don't know how me and my fiance are going to live together anymore. I don't know what to fucking do. 

Oh yeah and she was saying that I'm going to rehab. No, you can't make me, actually. 

TL;DR: Mom found all my gear and some of my dope. Got dope back, mom is acting like a crazy bitch. Going to dad's and will have no way to see fiance until I can afford an apartment. And this is all because of a story her friend told her last night. I don't know what to do. Once the dope runs out I will have nothing left :/ ",1386545227.0

I have been an opiate addict for the past 8 years. During this time I would partake in oxy, opana, MSContin, fentanyl (which I OD'd on and was in a coma for several weeks - had 2% chance of living)... That's a whole nother story. At my worst was using around $225/day of OC 80s (so 400mg+)

I don't want to preach to you guys - because I didn't want to hear it all this time.  But...Needless to say, the past year I started on Suboxone and as of Monday I took my last tapered dose.  Few days later the WDs came through full tilt and yesterday/today are the first days I don't have a majority of the symptoms. I'm dealing with the stomach problems with immodium and pain with aleve, sleeping with diphenhydramine... It does work!

We'll see where this journey goes but this is truly the first time in this long time period where I've been sober. I have no ankling to call my old friend - and am hoping I can stay strong.

For those of you who want to quit - yes it hurts.. Yes the weeks and months ahead for me I will have PAWS.. But its worth it! 

I'll update this post and let you guys know what ends up happening, but I hope this is it for good..  If you have any questions, feel free to PM me

1sjdoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1sjdoc/i_cant_take_it/,28,https://redd.it/1sjdoc,ImposterPreposterous,I can't take it.,"This year has been so hard. I've buried so many friends in the last twelve months. I've been under incredible stress, and have suffered more financial hardship than I care to describe. A lifetime battle with depression, anxiety, obsession with suicide, and violent impulses has taken repeated unexpected turns. And of course, the addiction: my enemy and my savior.

Through it all, [my beautiful wife](http://i.imgur.com/GWAVXhA.jpg) has stood by me. She has been the very image of composure, strength, grace, and support. She has never for a moment wavered. I've written a few times about her diabetes, and the close calls we've had with ketoacidosis on the one hand, and diabetic comas on the other. I've mentioned that she's deaf, I think. In the last three years she has gone from slightly hard of hearing to requiring hearing aids: 80% hearing loss. Four years ago she had bypass surgery, which saved her life, but the pain from the wires that hold her sternum together is immense and chronic. You guys were here and supportive five weeks ago, when she had her defibrillator installed, and these miraculous doctors saved her life yet again. They also knocked our wind out with the diagnosis of Congestive Heart Failure, stage 3. So, we've spent the last month trying to come to terms with that fact that she will die soon.

We hardly noticed the blister she got on her toe after we bought her a new pair of shoes. It seemed like such a small thing! It is important, however, to pay attention to even the smallest wounds to the extremities of diabetics. When the blister burst the wound got red and angry, and it spread, so we went to see her podiatrist. He gave us strict home care instructions, as well as antibiotics. He told us that managing her blood sugar levels was of critical importance until the condition cleared up. There was a small black area, necrotic, at the time, but the X-rays showed that the bacteria had not reached the bone. Everything was supposed to be all right.

In 24 hours time, it went from bad to [a gangrenous nightmare.](http://i.imgur.com/1EmxHgW.jpg)

The podiatrist told us that if it worsened, we were to go to the Emergency Room immediately. Last night we did just that. The attending physician diagnosed it as dry gangrene, but then refused to take responsibility. He referred us back to her podiatrist (who is AFK/MIA and has been throughout this week's freak ice storm). He gave her a 2mg shot of dilaudid and a script for a handful of norcos. He sent us home! I snapped the photograph I posted above right after we got home, so that image is what he turned his back on.

I spoke with /u/srblows about our problem and experience at length last night, and he advised me to go to a different ER, and to fail to mention the existence of our podiatrist. This tactic was superbly effective, and my wife was admitted at 2pm yesterday. They will amputate the second toe this evening, but so far we have been unable to get them to agree to put her under for the procedure. This has me shaking with rage. To top it off, in the time since I took that photograph to her being admitted, the rot spread. Four toes are now affected, and they are talking about how to save her foot now. So it isn't certain whether this single amputation will be sufficient. I shake some more, but it isn't just rage.

I left her there and came home to make sure [our son](http://i.imgur.com/vdSVtWC.jpg) ate proper meals, and to talk to him and ensure he understands the situation. He will be thirteen at the end of next month, and he is a very bright young man. After supper I drove him up to the hospital to spend time with his mother, and so I could get some kissing and hugging in myself. As it approached nine o'clock I informed him that even though school is cancelled tomorrow again due to the ice, that his luck would surely run out after that. It was time for him to go to bed, and I wasn't going to have his sleeping schedule messed up. I told my wife I would return after he was bathed, tooth brushed, and properly tucked in.

The problem is, I didn't return. I went and copped and I got high instead. I know she is awake. I know that she knows. I know that she will be waiting for me right up until they sedate her for the procedure. I know she is scared and I know that she needs me. I'm scared too, and I need her. But I can't hold it together, and she *doesn't* need me blubbering and bawling like a kid. She needs the man she married, but I haven't got the foggiest idea what happened to him. I sure as hell don't see him in the mirror right now.

Typing all of this has helped. I think I can drive up there now. I think I can deal with her seeing me cry, because I guess if we cry together then it isn't so bad. I can't excuse the 4 and a half hours I just wasted. I hate myself for making her worry. I don't know what has happened to me, but I'm just not myself anymore. I blow over at the slightest breeze lately.

I really wish our few remaining friends lived closer to us. I wish they could get on a plane and come sit with us at the hospital. Hell, I wish some of you could do so.

I love you guys. Thank you for listening to me. Please think of us tonight and tomorrow. Say a prayer if you are into that sort of thing. Send us good vibes either way. Surely we need them.

It's supposed to make you pass a drug test (piss test mind you) and I can't speak for lab test (gas) I can only speak for your standard 5 panel or 7 panel NIDA and I'm assuming higher panels, as long as it's a DIP TEST.


Let me say, IT WORKS. I literally just passed my drug test (7 panel) for PTI in SC about an hour ago right before my eyes. Sat there out the panel in my pissed and watched as all the panels (including Opiates AND opioids, so yes hydrocodone and oxycodone was included and THC, my main drugs I was stressing about) slowly rose to two lines which mean negative :). 


To state why I was worried is because like any addicts it's hard just stop taking your opiates so I did the stupid thing and just found a highly praised, cheap method that had the highest pass rate and continued to use. My last dose being 40mg of hydrocodone last night (supposed to leave your system 2-4 days after last dose) so I know it was still in my system. Also I smoked weed, really good weed, last weekend after I got drunk (I know, stupid) and that can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 90 days depending on frequency and quality, so I know that was also in my system. But I passed flying colors for all categories nonetheless!


THE SCIENCE:
From what I've gathered through research is that Sure Gel or fruit pectin (a gelling powder used to make jams and jellies) once ingested coats your stomach in the gel preventing anything in your system from exiting through urine for about 3 hours or so. It does not detox you forever, only mask for a short time. So if you know when your test will be then this is almost fool proof. 


THE METHOD:
What I did was starting about 5 hours before my test, started drinking water. I probably drank about 2 liters total. Then about 3 hours before my test I ate a small meal and took a vitamin B complex to add a yellow color back into my piss. Finally about 2 hours before my test I mixed a WHOLE PACKET of the Sure Gel into about 500ml of cranberry juice and downed it. Be sure to drink it fast and constantly shake or stir or it will start gelling up. After that I drank another bottle of water and made sure I pissed about 2 times before the test just to flush anything that was left out. 


THE TEST: 
When I pissed I made sure to piss a little into the toilet then collect mid stream my sample.  I then handed it to the guy who measured the temperature. He gave me the panel, showed me where to hold it, then watched in complete happiness as all categories rose to passing level. NEGATIVE. SUCCESS. 


TL;DR:
I passed a drug test while opioids and THC was in my system by drinking water and a $2.94 pack of Sure Gel from my local grocery store.

My legs are kicking uncontrollably. My skin is crawling and I can't focus on anything but the pain I feel. Every waking second is a new hell. I wake my boyfriend up, We fight as I beg him to walk a mile and a half to the only cure. While doing this I completely disregard his suffering, and the torture he is also feeling. He is weak, and I would rather suffer than try to stand. He slams the door without looking back, and I wait. Selfish. That word plays around in my mind as the time ever so slowly taunts me. I wait, and I wait. The door opening is a sound that is euphoric to my ears. He has the cure.  My body feels stronger already, but really it's all in my head. I run down the hall and he reaches into his pocket. In slow motion I watch it drop from his fingers into mine. Then everything speeds up. I drop the pill to a piece of foil, inhale it's precious fumes, and before I know it... It's gone. My body softens, I feel human again. More than human though, I feel like I am floating on a cloud. I look at my boyfriend. He is relieved, the anger is gone. His demons play well with mine. I have never escaped reality so effortlessly. And I don't mean obtaining the cure, I mean by what it did to my mind. I fell down, down, down, into a feather bed. Wrapped in clouds I forgot what pain was. ""We're running out of money, we are going to lose our apartment"" He shook me, pleaded with me, fought me, hugged me. I cared, somewhere. Deep down I know I did. On the surface though, I fought. Excuses flowed through me. ""Shakespeare made all of his young lovers die. Poisoned, stabbed, or drown.. He must of realized some people are only meant to sleep together six feet underground."" The road I was leading myself down was dark and lonely. I picked up my phone to see all the missed calls and texts from family and friends. I ignored them all. As time wore on, only the collection agency's cared where I was. Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but, when we look back everything is different? Pill, foil, smoke. I nod off, into a euphoric sleep with the wings of an angel caressing me.. Then I wake up. My legs are kicking uncontrollably. My skin is crawling and I can't focus on anything but the pain I feel.

I've got the FTL brand seeds, the way I've always made my tea is putting the seeds into a 2l bottle, adding some lemon juice and a shot of vodka, then adding enough water to reach the level of the seeds in the bottle, and shaking for 30 seconds. Then I unscrew the cap and squeeze the bottle to get the liquid out without any of the seeds making it into the tea. I do another wash then drink the liquid, I got 4 pounds so I'm gonna use it all and hope I catch a nod.

Also, does tolerance ever go back to baseline? I've noticed that even with very long periods of abstinence, I still have a fairly hefty tolerance(relatively speaking). Back when I was using it took 5 roxis to catch a nod, or a few bags of dope up the nose.",1386632122.0

Hey druggit I need your help. I also need to get some things off my chest, so I have a story to share with all of you lovely people. 

Almost two years ago I met a girl. We'll call her Rose anonymity reasons. Now little did I know at the time, but Rose would become a very important person in my life. When we met I wasn't in a very good place in my life. A few months prior I was evicted from my house, and shortly after that I lost my job. So I was staying with some very good friends that were kind enough to take me in when I had nowhere else to go. We began dating after a few weeks of talking, and after a few months of dating she offered to let me move in with her. She didn't have a job at the time either so I actually ended up moving into her mother's house. Not exactly the most ideal situation, but I really liked her, and she accepted for who I was. See I have a lot of issues with my back, and knees, but especially my back, so I take medication for my pain. Not prescribed medication, so basically anything that I can get my hands on. She understood, and she not only accepted it, but also defended me on occasion. She saw how much pain I was in, and would do everything in her power to help me, especially when it got so bad that I couldn't hardly even get out of bed. 

So time went by, and we inevitably ended up falling in love. Deeply in love. She also inevitably started to take the occasional pill as well. It scared me. I didn't want her to end up as an addict like me, but I thought it was okay as long as I was there to watch over her and make sure she didn't get to deep into anything. I would have never been okay with myself had I let that happen. Unfortunately as many of you probably know, when you are messing around with things of that nature you are walking a very fine line, and chemicals of that nature are nothing if not very sneaky, and deceptive. What was once a occasional roxy turned into driving around for an hour and a half trying to score a bag. 

Now our relationship was strong. It was not perfect by any means, but we overcame many a obstacle out of nothing more than sheer love. Things gradually got worse tho as they always do, and I started to see the signs of what I never wanted to happen to her. I saw the feinding and realized, it was already to late. By this time all I could do was feed her habit. I should have stopped right then and there, but I didn't. I was to afraid of losing her considering once the drugs took over our relationship started falling apart, fast. Without her I had nothing. To this day I'm still just an empty husk of a man. I smile, I laugh, but on the inside there is nothing. Anyways once I realized what I had done I started slipping into a deep depression, and it only got worse. I'm not surprised she left me. I would have done the same thing. I couldn't be there for her. I wasn't even there for myself.

The breakup was messy to say the least. I still harbor some resentment for the things that happened in the aftermath, but I'm trying everyday to put that behind me. Because despite how deeply I was hurt, I know that she is the only person on this planet I still want to be with. 

Until just a few days ago the only contact we've had was shortly after the breakup when she texted me to find out if I could score some dope, and the subsequent conversation that followed which basically consisted of me screaming and crying about how she hurt me. Things had started to return to a state of normality. I was no longer waking up in the middle of the night balling my eyes out because of some nightmare of mine she had invaded. But like I said that all ended a few days ago after months of willing myself to not pick up that phone. She asked me how I was doing, and I neglected to answer. I was to afraid it was some ploy to help her get high. Before to long curiosity got the better of me though and I responded. Why after everything that happened? Because I'm so damn in love with this girl it hurts. That's why. So after talking for a bit I let her know that I'm always here for her. If she ever needed to talk or ever really needed anything I would be there. 

She responded. She said she thought she was addicted. My heart sank. 

And this druggit is where I need your help. See while I take them to relieve pain, she is the opposite end of the spectrum. She takes them as a sort of anti-depressant/social lubricant. She doesn't know how to stop, and quite frankly neither do I. She says she isn't ready to stop yet anyways because at this point they are the only thing that makes her even the slightest bit happy. I would stop for her. I want to. She is my world. I would love for us to do this together, and maybe one day be back together, with an even stronger bond. I know that may never happen, but so long as I can fix what I had such a large part creating maybe I can have at least a little piece of mind, and continue on with my life. I have some ideas as to how to go about recovery but I want your input druggit. And just so you know, the only way I will ever leave this girls side is if I turn out to just be nothing but toxic to her, and she could never get clean with me in the picture. We may never be friends, we may never lay in the same bed and hold each other again, but regardless of how much it hurts me I'm going to be there. Poppy is a hell of a drug, but love is even more so.

This past weekend has been dry.  Small batches here and there, but nothing stable at all.  So last night a fellow user calls me with a tip that a guy at 'local sketchy motel #3' has some fire.  So I pick her up and we head to the motel.  We pull in and a older black guy is standing in the upstairs hall, eying us the entire time.  We walk upstairs, into room 218.  We find and older black woman braiding a young man's hair.  She is nice enough, but looks at us incredibly judgingly.  The older man who was watching us has now entered the room.  He is big, at least 6'3"", easily over 200 lbs.  He hands a cell phone to the woman, says something fast and slurred, then turns and asks for a cigarette.  The woman says a couple lines, then hangs up.

""He gon' meet you outside...you gots to do your business out there, I ain't having that happen around my baby (referring to the young man seated at her base)""

This seems fishy.  We go outside, the older man following us closely the entire time.  He speaks up ""We gon' get in your car, do the deal, then you gotta get on, they's cameras all in this facility"".  The sketch level increases.  

We hop in my car and wait...5 minutes...10 minutes...then, the man's phone rings...
""Aight, pull on over here by the drink machines, and he gon' jump in and do his thing""
We pull around, but I see no drink machines in sight...We turn the corner, where we hit a dead end, facing a brick wall, closed in on 3 sides...

My heart is racing. In my head, the 1000 scenarios that all end with me being robbed, killed, or beat all play over in my head.  I look to homegirl, ""This is sketchy as fuck, what the fuck are we doing?!"" She shakes her head in the international ""I don't know"" signal. 

Next thing I know, I see a figure emerge from the shadows...He walks with a typical crook in his step.  He walks up and inspects my car...he looks at the older man, who signals ""It's all good man, just get in""   He slides into the backseat, mumbling.  He says something undecipherable.  The older man translates, ""what y'all want now?""

I tell him 3.  He fumbles around, revealing 2 wax bags.  He hands them to me.  I say ""I needed 3"".  He mumbles for a couple seconds, then says, ""Its all there man, scale it an' ev'rythin'.""  I look at them in the darkness of my car.  One looks kinda fat, the other - probably an even point.  If it's dope at all.

I hand him the money...fucking 90 bucks.  Can't believe I'm doing this.  As the money enters his hands, I feel the intense adrenaline rush like I know I'm about to be ambushed by either police or worse, this man's goon squad. 

He flips the money and counts.  My homegirl asks if we can call him again if we ever need.  He says something under his breath, and gets outta the car.  I look at homegirl.  

""We need to GTFO of here...""

I pull in reverse, start backing up, only for the big guy to be standing directly behind the car.  

This is where I get fucked.

He says ""Hold on a minute, now..""

(FUCK)

""...lemme get 5 dollars for a pack of smokes...""

I'm trying to get out of here.  I give the man my pack and back out in a fury.  

I drop homegirl off with her bag.  She bangs the shit, so she'll know if it's good early on.

I drive home.  I pull in the driveway.  Homegirl's calling me.  This is not good.

""Hello?""
'YO....'
""What's wrong, are we fucked? Shit ain't good??""
'I shot that shit..........threw up immediately.  This shit is FIRE man'
""Gotta go"" *HANG UP*

Run inside and crush my two bags up.  It's super hard.  I make a line about 2 inches long.  

*SNORT*

Immediately I taste the dope.  The drip is glorious.  I gag immediately.  There's a weird, pill-like taste in there as well.  With in seconds, goosebumps shoot through my body. 

Dope ended up being pretty damn good.  I'm pretty sure what we got wasn't 3 pts.  but there wasn't gonna be anything else coming this way, so whatev.

I wish I had more time and money to prepare (dont we all) but I don't and this is the best I've come up with. I've read kratom and phenibut are both miracles to have during withdrawal. Unfortunately I don't have 60 bucks to throw down on bulk kratom or a tub of phenibut or the time for them to get here. Wish I would think of these things in advance...

I've also been reading online that lyrica (pregabalin) helps alot with the restless leg symptoms. Which is the worst part for me. I can deal with feeling like total crap, but I NEED my sleep, and cannot sleep with that bullshit. 



So with the last of my money I've gathered 

* 4 1/2 bottles of lope

* ~20 75 mg lyricas

* 5 servings bali kratom

I know lope is highly regarding as just about the only thing worth utilizing during WD's around here, but does anyone have any idea how to incorporate the lyrica or kratom? I was thinking:

* 225 mg lyrica x2 time daily, once upon awakening once at night

* 15-20mg lope upon awakening.

* 1 serving kratom upon awakening, possible once mid day during peak wd

* NSAIDS as needed

taper lyrica by 1 75 mg at each dosing each day after day 2 or 3 depending on which is worse, until gone.



I've also read dxm is helpful during withdrawal and with how bad I'm gonna feel I know I wont be above going out and jacking a few boxes of cough syrup pills if it'll help. 

Any ideas or suggestions?",1386730909.0

So pure that I'm pretty itchy and nauseous :@,"Note: I post here regularly under my main account, but decided to make an alt account for privacy. 

So after a long hiatus from dope (all the way back in August), I decide to treat myself with a gram, and it is SUPER DANK. With no tolerance, I decided yesterday to snort 25mg after testing out a small 10mg bump to gauge quality, and after jumping in the shower for a quick rinse, I start to notice the all too familiar 'warm fuzzy blanket' feeling and the delightful tingly effect all over my body. My eyes begin to get heavy. A smile creeps across my face. I know I'm about to be in a state of pure bliss.

I get out, dry off, look in the mirror, and boy oh boy, my pupils are almost non-existent. I head back to my room, put on some classical music, crawl into bed, and *relax*. Ahhhh, so nice! 

After about two hours, however, I start feeling bit queasy. Not enough to vomit but it was definitely there. And I was beginning to feel super itchy (more than usual). Even with an antihistamine (25mg diphenhydramine) I can't seem to get rid of the itch. Ugh!

Today, I did the same, but I only snort 25mg instead of 35mg. What I don't understand is why I had so much more itching today on a lower dose than I did yesterday, and today I took 50mg DPH and not 25mg. I still have nausea too, both of which are bad enough to make me realize that if I'm taking such low doses, even without a tolerance, this dope must be pretty dang pure. Almost too pure...the rocks I got literally take 5 minutes to grind up. It's so pure that it'll probably last me 3-4 weeks.

Is there anything other than antihistamines that I can take or do to reduce these negative side effects? The only explanation I can think of for the nausea is maybe I'm not eating enough food, but I've never gotten nausea from opiates before. I also wonder if perhaps there's some cutting agent that is causing all the added itchiness? It's bad enough to the point where I have no interest in redosing if it means I have to deal with all the scratching, rubbing, and nausea. What gives?! :'(

Plus if I end up failing the subject that im on the borderline of 50% in ill be devastated, only got a year left in my degree and dont need to make it two...

Heroin just feels like the most decadent treat I can give myself and I love it for that. I tend to binge whenever I get it now, cant help myself not to have it daily when its just sitting there hehe. First 0.5g I bought at the start of the year I snorted but have been IV'ing it whenever I buy it since because its god damn expensive in my country($280/g) albeit nicely potent, can catch a nod of 0.05g which during the first few days using has me throwing up and in the second week of a binge still lets me catch a nod. Guessing my big breaks between binges help heaps though.

It was fine honestly, my addiction never bought any problems while it was underground and the people I associated didn't know about it. There was never a fight, no obvious signs of addiction to my family, life was really good honestly. Besides the comedowns and sick periods, of course.  
  
Then one day, it all just came spewing out to my dad who I was living with at the time that I was pretty god damn addicted to smack and I've been on it for the past year while living under his roof.  
And holy fuck, did life take a turn after that.  
The fights, the dis-owning, the homelessness, the hunger, the depression, it was the fucking shittest time to be honest. Over the few weeks while this was happening I had gone through my last ever withdrawals and had given up opiates cold-turkey. I was, however, smoking a lot of green and taking a decent amount of benzos still, with the occasional stimulant shot.  
  
After a few months of living like a bum, I had enough. I made calls, broke down in tears to my family apologizing for what I'd done to them, begged for a second chance and to get help.  
And honestly it was the greatest thing I have ever done. I moved back in my mum 1400 kilometers away and it was still a struggle though. I was still using other drugs, and she'd have none of that. There was a month of daily screaming matches, getting kicked out on the reg for bringing illicit drugs into her house, and sneaking out to get high.   
  
This went on all the way up until she said I had to see a psychiatrist and get some help or leave her house for good. I went along to the doc and had a good long chat, just trying to keep everyone happy by being there. Somehow, the discussion went from a focus on the possibility of bipolar (which I have) to being diagnosed with symptomatic ADD and given a Dexedrine prescription. And since then, I haven't even felt the need, let alone having cravings, to get high or drunk or get in any kind of mind-altered state at all.  
  
Admittedly I'm pretty addicted to these pills now, and I'm extremely tweaked even as a write this. But it's better in my opinion that having a shot of smack a few times a day or using oxy's like there's no tomorrow to look forward to.  
  
The prescription has been the a god send, for me at least. It's got it's cons, but they don't close to weighing out the benefits of this drug.

So today was not a good day. My boyfriend and I were fucked out of being paid back by people we had fronted. So we were left sick and needless to say I was sick and pissy and bitchy.

So because of that I took all my anger out on my boyfriend (fuck up #1) I said things I would never say and called him names and was just a pure fuckin cunt. It got to the point where our relationship was on the line!!!
At one point, he said to me that I'm never gonna be happy till I get my pill for the day. When he said that it hit me so hard. Its true. 

What I don't understand is how my life can be so consumed by such an inanimate object. I want my boyfriend to be the reason I'm happy or the sunshine or just listening to good music and having a pill sometimes be great but if I don't have it that it be okay too. I just can't physically make myself stop thinking about getting my next pill or that I'm gonna do to get my next pill. I just got my drug charges dropped and now I'm writing bad checks and could possibly get charged for that. I used to be a smart girl but addiction has changed me and I think about my life later on and if it stays like this I will be homeless or in jail. I was in rehab for almost a year and it didn't do anything for me obviously. I'm lost in the cold hearted bitch of addiction's spell spiraling out of control.

I know that hydromorphone is water soluble which is why I did this, then I used a short clear straw to snort the liquid and tilted my head back to keep the solution out of my throat and to not have any fall out of my nose. I felt a slightly heavier buzz but nothing better than hydro or oxy. I was wondering if you guys had any tips on how to take dillies to feel that crazy high, besides IV or plugging.

I'm pretty low down the dealer chain, but I make decent money, and recently have been making even more because I found a new, cheaper connect in the city. So I get paid 815 dollars, nothing special, but enough to get my my usual 2 logs ($600).  

I call my guy and schedule the deal, as usual, only this time he says he has (popular dope city in the northeast USA) bags which are more expensive than usual. I have been making these high-dollar (for me, anyway) deals with this guy for over a month now, and he's never steered me wrong. In fact, he's hooked me up on multiple occasions. This isn't even the most I've spent with him at once, so I've been a pretty good customer I think.

Of course, since it's new stuff I'm a little hesitant and I ask if I can try a couple before I buy, since he knows I'm getting some pretty good weight. He says yes, and pinches me off a couple out of this 14-bag bundle - which I guess is standard for the city I mentioned. I load up my rig and shoot it, and get a pretty good rush and feel nice, so all is well. I tell him I've got $600 bucks and he tells me what he can give me for that, and I agree.

So he goes into the kitchen where I guess his stash is and brings me out the product, and I leave on my merry way. Now, my people have been waiting on me all day and I make at least 3 stops before I get back to my house. As soon as I get home after those stops, my same people that I just met with are blowing my phone up telling me I beat them and this shit was really expensive and didn't do fucking anything for them.

Naturally, I'm confused, I tried it and it was fine, and I have a HUGE tolerance so I know what I'm talking about for the most part. I tell them to hold on, I'll get back to them in a few minutes. I get ready to load up another shot and dump a few bags out. Immediately I notice that there's no vinegar smell like what I tried up at the dealer's house. The color is the same, and the weight is the same, so I load up anyway and shoot.

Nothing. At all. No rush, no high, no nods.

Fuck.

So I continue to try a little out of each bundle, hoping there was just some that went bad or something. Nope. They're all beat.

I call my dealer up and tell him the situation. He bullshits me and tells me that none of his other people have complained. And that I tried it right in front of him and said it was fine. (It was at the time)

So basically, I'm out $600. And not only was that product my way to get high till next payday, selling off some of it was my gas money, my food money, and most importantly my money for Christmas presents for my family and girlfriend. I have less than $200 after buying from some other guy last night just so I could get high, and it looks like I have no other way to get my money back. So the holiday is ruined for me.

So be careful who you're dealing with guys and gals, even someone who you think you're cool with can beat you in this game.

**TL;DR: I got sold $600 of bunk product and now have no money for anything, including Christmas presents for my family**",1387036687.0

Danny Boyle has stated his wish to make a sequel to Trainspotting based on Porno which takes place nine years later. He is reportedly waiting until the original actors themselves age visibly enough to portray the same characters, ravaged by time; Boyle joked that the natural vanity of actors would make it a long wait.[1] On 10 September 2009, Robert Carlyle revealed that Boyle was ""edging closer"" to making Porno. Carlyle, who played Begbie in the film, said he would ""jump through hoops of fire backwards"" for the filmmaker and would ""do Porno tomorrow for nothing.""

The film will pick up on the same characters 10 years later. However, Ewan McGregor, who played anti-hero Renton, has said in interviews that a sequel would be a ""terrible shame"". Boyle and McGregor have not worked together since 1997's A Life Less Ordinary, when McGregor was passed over in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role in Boyle's big screen adaptation of Alex Garland's novel, The Beach.[2][3] In 2013, McGregor noted that he is ""ready to work"" on the film with Boyle after reconciling.[4]

In 2013 Boyle said that any sequel to Trainspotting would be loosely based on Porno which he has described as “not a great book in the way that Trainspotting, the original novel, is genuinely a masterpiece”. Boyle says that if the sequel happens 2016 would be the release.[5]

In July 2013 at the San Diego Comic-Con Robert Carlyle officially confirmed that the sequel will happen

My first question is what the actual half life of fentanyl in the body is approximately, since this patch would indicate that it delivers the dose over 12 hours, and i have one source saying transdermal administration is 7 hours and another saying 20-27 hours (the one more likely for a 3 day patch). The second is, can I cut sections of this patch off geometrically and use math to calculate an exact safe dosage for myself? 

I do not have much of a tolerance currently because i'm an on/off user but i've been doing 10-20mg of hydro a day again for a few days and it was already enough to trigger a tolerance build, and i don't have a steady pill hook right now. My next question is how fast the patches release if heated while wearing them. If I can make the small section i cut off instantly release i can get a solid single time dose out of each square without wondering if i'm gonna accidentally OD because the section i cut off to keep me good for the normal amount of time it lasts is overexposed to heat. As a side note, I am a rave DJ and would LIKE to be able to use a section for an upcoming full weekend of gigs I have because my back will be too fucked up for me to comfortably stand over a mixer by the middle of the second night, but the temperatures in these venues can easily get pretty high and I'm concerned about the patch possibly releasing to fast if i use it in a time release manner. At what point of heat external to myself should I be concerned. I was assuming heat pads and any direct heating source were both a big no no but there's always something people miss

I know the risks of fentanyl are much higher than any other opioids that are readily available so i would actually do a test run at a quarter and then half the dose i'd think is good enough before taking the full one, just in case i have a fent sensitivity. I will also have EMT's present at the event for most of the 12 hour period in which it will be releasing who keep naloxone handy (I called and checked with the company we use to be sure). I also don't currently have access to any other hookup except a go through for norcos who wouldn't be able to handle the patch either, nor even afford enough norcos to trade for it (something I can since I budget for it monthly when its a problem). I know this is a bit of a ramble but I just got back from tonight's event and picking it up and I'm extremely excited to have something this potent (for 1/4th of dank bud no less), and my last pill just kicked in. My life is just taking off right now, I don't want to fuck it up taking this patch and overdoing it or worse, but my pain isn't bad enough by my physical therapists standards right now to recommend prescribing me any medication long term enough that i have what I need, and using this patch myself could cover me every weekend for the next 3 months if i keep my tolerance where it is and my math is correct. **IF I CAN'T CUT THIS PATCH PLEASE SPEAK UP**, It's staying in the packing until I know the safety precautions I need to take so I can sell it for a bottle of oxy or something instead, but right now all I have is this and 3 norcos till the end of the month.

Good reading inside, if you have the time. If not, carry on. Won't hurt my feelings. I understand.","{{{WARNING}}} This will be a longer post than usual. I'll put a summary at the bottom for the lazy folks. 

If you frequent this sub and are an active part of this community then you may be familiar with who I am and some of the events in my recent life. You may like me, you may not. Either way, I want to share some of my experience and my plans for the future. 

 I'll start with a brief account of how my addiction began and some of the progression that led to where I am now. 
 When I was 16 I was working the graveyard shift at a Whataburger in Texas. I partied a lot at the time, and usually got high before, during, and after work. One night, a buddy of mine showed up at the restaurant and gave me three 10mg Vicodins. I had never taken any kind of opiate and had no knowledge of the drug other than they were used to treat paid. He said, ""Dude, don't take them all while you're at work. Just take one."" Sure. I ended up eating all of them one by one because I didn't really feel much. Within an hour, I was working my ass off, sweating like a two dollar whore on discount night, and scratching my nose like it was a lottery ticket. That was the night I found my first true drug love, and didn't at the time know what kind f journey I was headed for. I found my buddy as soon as my shift was over and said, ""Man! You got any more of those little fuckers? Those were the shit. I need some more."" He was out and I was bummed. I dabbled after that for years. A couple of unfortunate broken bones would lead to a couple of prescriptions and I was stay higher than the clouds until the script was gone and I would have a dry spell until I found more. Never really was a problem, though. Just a party. Eventually I found OxyContin. Holy fuck! I didn't think it could be any better, then ""Reneck Heroine"" was thrust into my life. 80mg = $20 ( I miss those days ) I still only dabbled though. Around the time I was 20 I was taking loritab 10s regularly and began taking them daily. Didn't think there was anything wrong. Didn't know what Kim of fire I was toying with. I remember the first time that I has withdrawals. I had gone for two or three weeks strait of taking three or four a day and had run out of money. The day after my last dose I felt fucking miserable. Body felt like I was covered in lead. Vomit coming out of one end, you know what coming out of the other end at an astonishing rate. I didn't know what was wrong with me. (Did I catch the flu in the dead of summer.) I called my dealer. ""Man, I can't come by today. I'm broke and I think I caught the flu. I feel like I'm dying over here."" He tells me about what I had done to myself, that I was going through withdrawals, and the only way to feel better was to take another pill. Hair of the dog, right? ""Kinda like drinking a beer when you're hungover"", he says. ""Come over and I'll give you a couple, but you gotta slow it down."" I immediately knew that I had to give this habit up. I couldn't end up like my uncle, who was a heroine junky. After a couple of rough days, I made it out alive and didn't pick up another pill until I broke my hand. Full prescription with three refills and I never looked back. Opiates became my life after that. I was either nodding my ass off, looking to my next nod, or sick as fuck because I couldn't cop. I moved a couple times, kicked each time, but eventually came back to my love that I hated so much. 
 I ended up here in Louisiana. I stayed clean for an entire year after I moved out here and was sure that I was going to keep it that way. Christmas Day 2008, a guy that worked in the shop next to mine tells me to come over and drink a beer. As we drank and told lies about our past, he puts his fist out and tells me Merry Christmas. I took what he had, and can you guess what it was? Two pretty oval shaped loritab 10s. Off to the races we went. My use went back to daily within a couple of months, but I wasn't doing too bad. Just three, maybe five a day. I began having knee problems so bad I couldn't walk unless I had a stomach full of pills. By the time I had my surgery, I was taking ten to fifteen loris a day. It became obvious to my girlfriend that I had a problem when she found out that I burned through $2,000 of my surgery money on pills. I was ashamed, but we worked through it. I told her I would stop after my surgery and recovery, and life would be ok. I didn't tell her that when I went on my lunch break at work, or when I came home late, that I was going to score with money I borrowed from my mom. (I worked for my parents at the time building race cars) I moved on to Roxys during that time as well, and was eating them at first. Moved on to snorting them after some peer pressure from my buddies, and after a lot of thought and curiosity I began my IV career early last year (spring 2012), still convinced that I had full control of this beast they called addiction. By the end of 2012, I was on my way to rehab. I spent New Years 2012/2013 in a twenty eight day treatment facility. I was a married man now. I had an almost two year old son now. I had a life worth living and didn't want to throw away the best things that ever happened in my life for a needle and a 30mg pill (or five 30mg pills). After rehab, I felt so alive. I had emotions again. I laughed and loved like I never had before. I had no clue what I had been missing out on all because of my addiction to the opiates I enjoyed so much. 
 So it was time for me to be a productive member of my family and society. I got a job. Started working 12 hour shifts right out of the gate as a machinist. Then the pain started to resurface. Pain that was a result of a car accident I was involved in early 2012. Before I started working, I was positive I would be ok. I could endure the pain without any temptation to pick up an opiate again. Wouldn't go through that same old viscous circle in life known as addiction. I was wrong. I started going back to my doctor and got back on the Narco 10s. Those led to Roxys yet again, and before I knew it, I had a needle in my hand again, only this time, instead of injecting a 30mg pill into my veins, I'm forcing .25mg of this interesting little powder known as heroine. 

 This is where I am today. Pushing H into my body once rig-full at a time. I haven't even tried to hide it from my wife this time. She knows everything, and although I'm not proud of myself or my actions, I'm honest with her. I know that was what hurt her the most the last go around. The lies and betrayal.
 So I ask myself, I said, ""Self... What do you intend to do now? End up like your junky uncle - dead at 45 from an overdose? Or are you gonna pick your fucking nuts up and beat this shit this time?"" Ladies and Gentleman, today I am choosing the latter option. Tomorrow I start on my poor mans detox. I have three suboxone strips that I plan to use for the first few days, and when those run out I'm gonna Lope it up. I have a gram of some dank ass bud, which I haven't partaken in quite some time. Atleast a year since I smoked pot last. I also am going to purchase some Xanax tomorrow and Monday I get my script of Klonopin. It's going to be rough, but I'm prepared this time. I'm going to be the man.. The father that my son deserves. I'm going to be the husband my wife deserves. The son my parents have missed out on all of these years. 

 If you've actually read this entire post, thank you for taking the time to do so. I know it was long and probably poorly written in some areas, but this is who I am. This is my life and struggles that make me who I am. Besides being a junky, I'm a motor head, a musician, a comedian, nerd, food lover, goofball, and a slew of other things. I love life.  I love being able to enjoy the little things like sitting around a camp fire with friends and family and playing old country music on my guitar and murdering the lyrics of an old Hank Williams song or destroying Bob Seager. 
 I'll keep you all posted on my progress and definitely am not going anywhere. If any of you ever need any help, I'll definitely do what I can. I'm always available to talk. Keep your heads up and your blood flowing. Happy nods family. 

The Lure

TL;DR: Started from the bottom, now I'm here. Ok, seriously : Started taking vicodins when I was 16, led to me shooting heroine at age 28 with a bunch of other opiates and drugs somewhere between those ages. Now I'm going to kick the opiates again.

My second time ever, I was 16 years old and had a ton of leftover percs and vicodin from getting a bar placed in my chest. Took 5 percs and I just felt perfect, I got that 'click' in my head, and realized that this was the way I wanted to feel for the rest of my life. It was the perfect feeling, everything was fixed, I wasn't anxious, I was peppy and talkative, I felt so grateful to be alive. I realized that this was THE drug for me, and I fell head over heels in love with it. I'd had very few drug experiences prior to that, alcohol a few times and pot once or twice. I actually got my very first IT job while buzzed off a nice stamp of H up the nose, I put it up my nose 20 minutes before the interview and aced the fuck out of it. Opiates fix everything that's wrong with me, if there was a medication that could do that, I'd take it, but there isn't one.


You can never recapture that magical quality of the first few highs, that pure exhilaration of discovering something incredible. That's what I miss the most out of my highs.

I'm not going to IV them because honestly it would just be kind of a waste. I've been snorting them. It seems to have better effects than oral.

Rather, this definition probably varies, most likely influenced by the geographical location in which you exist or it is used regularly. I'm from the south and first heard the word tooting used to describe drugs by my dad who asked me once if I ""was tootin' any coke"" one night while we were out (I wasn't that evening). 

Like I said, the definition you adhere to probably is in accordance with the one that is used in your geographical area. We don't have BTH where I am, and, thus, nobody uses the word to refer to smoking. I've heard the straw used for snorting ubiquitously referred to as a tooter across a multitude of geographical areas, so I felt if was say to say ""tooting."" If we can settle that debate, I'd love to get back to the matter at hand: NETI POTS!

Do you guys also use a motherfuckin Neti Pot (http://i.imgur.com/0D3GskP.jpg)   to keep those ski slopes clean???

Folks ask about things that will potentiate and this is my fav methods to share with folks! Shoot, I've been tooting dope most of this evening. Nothing extreme, but had a long day at the office, and felt like enjoying my evening at home while I cleaned around the house. Have some quality dope, but it just wasn't getting me blasted, so I decided to neti before I ran out for a quick errand. 

Did my business, and it was very productive. Tooted a ill bit of dope and walked out the door, destination walmart. I'm not one to drive under the influence, and generally avoid it at all costs (DUI in college. Terrible experience I don't want to replicate). I wasn't really that high before this last line, and had probably consumed less than .2 total throughout the evening. I felt totally comfortable driving until I got to the end of my street. I had quickly realized that it would not only be unsafe for me to drive, but that I would very likely be involved in an accident due to the fact I was suddenly nodding like a worn out puppy so I turned around. Trip delayed until tmrw, but no big deal, and I'm a lot happier high as fuck!

So...do my other sniffers neti????",1387091038.0

-first off what you need for this will be a Piece of foil, Bic Pen hollowed, lighter 

When you have the fentanyl patch cut in into strips the size of your finger nail after you done this you take off the bigger side of the sticker part off. Now u  need to hold both sides down so while you use your finger nail to scratch the sticky part off go back and forth nice and easy till it starts to roll into a snot bugger, after it's off u roll it up and place it onto the piece of foil heat it up until it bubbles then smear it down a line.

My terrible technique has made it pretty hard to hit the veins in the crook of my elbow, which has led me to injecting into the veins on the topside of my hand as well as the vein on the side of my wrist closest to my thumb.
    
Last night I tied off using some rubber-bands.  I was able to tie them up pretty tight which was causing my hand to feel numb pretty quickly.  Luckily, I was able to register very quickly in the vein on the side of my wrist nearest to my thumb.  I shot halfway, re-registered to make sure that I was still in, and carefully shot the rest in.  As I started to carefully remove the rubber-bands I got a sudden hot pain in my hand.  It wasn't immediately after the shot, but not too long thereafter.  I quickly bit through the rest of the rubber-bands, no longer being concerned with saving them.
I could taste the hit, but didn't get much of a rush.  My hand however swelled up pretty fast and it was difficult to close my hand into a fist or move my fingers very much.
I decided to give it a warm bath and compress and then get some rest.  It's been about 18 hours, and I think the swelling has gone down a little bit, but it's still visibly swollen and the tightness persists.

TL;DR: Shot into wrist, hand swelled up. Swelling relieved some after 18 hours, but still worse for wear.

I want to know what to expect. I am used to bangin ~10-20mgs of Oxymorphone. However, it will be about 30 days or so since I last dosed when I get the H. I want to know how you guys would compare ~ a stamp of some good H to OxyM. I don't want to accidently overdue it my first dose. Is the rush the same? How much longer if at all does it last? I mostly did the opana for the incredible rush I got. Plus the taste in my mouth was to die for, and the nods were definitely enjoyable. Hopefully someone has experience with both. Also, would BTH be better, or some powder? I can get either. 

I'm sorry if this seems like a dumb obvious question, I've just never had a straight answer of OxyM compared to some decent heroin.

A few other questions, too.","What the title says. I noticed roughly four years ago when I took a low dose of robotussin I would feel lethargic for days. I thought it was normal and continued to use it before I was put on prescription sleeping aids. One night I took a semi decent dose (150mg dxm) and tripped my balls out for 6 hours when I was 16. I went to my doctor very confused about what just happened because I had no idea the robotussin caused it seeing how all my friends had to drink half a whole bottle to get the high they talked about. I was tested and came back with CYP2D6 deficiency, and have sense had fun with my little charm/curse with dxm every now and again. 

Anyways, the past few days I've been doing some research into DPH to see what kind of high it gives and realized really quickly I wanted no part in that shit. I've taken up to 100mg DPH just whiten the past month and I just fell asleep (while on dope) and was at least hoping to use it in low mg's. Tonight I had a terrible allergic reaction and I was again double checking to see if it would cause any adverse reactions if I took it. I then stumbled upon a forum of people saying their pain medications wern't working at all and they all had the CYP2D6 deficiency. To think of it, I can't remember a single time I've gotten high off of hydro's or codeine. I took like 60mg after not touching opiates for six months and it did nothing besides make me sleepy. I've also noticed I've always had to take a lot more than other people when I first started fucking with opiates. Am I double screwed because of this deficiency? 

TL;DR (like all my questions are): Does the CYP2D6 deficiency also make DPH more sensitive like it does DXM for me? Would this explain my inability to get a high from hydros/codeine sense the beginning of my use? Could this possibly explain why I've had to 'abuse' other opiates to get pain relief before an addiction? 

I hope someone decides to take the time to read this, I'm very curious about this kind of stuff. ",1387197483.0

However, from around June until a week ago I was using 80mg crushable oxys. I used around 3 of them a day on average. I used those well before I ever touched the d's and they are my personal favourite. Now they are real tough to get a hold on.

So I switched back to the dillys but I'm finding that they don't have nearly the same effect. After 2 or 3 of them it staves off the withdrawal effects but I'm just not getting a buzz like I used to. Even if I do 8-10 of them in a day. I understand tolerance and all that but I mean I just don't understand where the buzz went!

I should mention I snort them. Any suggestions for how to get a better use out of them? Besides ye ol' IV method? Any tips would be appreciated! ",1387129850.0

[IV Dope],"So been chipping for almost a year now, only get on the H during my uni breaks, so like 4-5 times the last year(but those are 1-2 week binges). Anyway after like the 2nd or so binge I ran out of sterile water and just started boiling tap water in the kettle, letting it cool and mixing it up. 

Never had any complications and the bottled sterile water that comes in the sharp kits downunder is kind of dodgy for more than one use(according to the text on the vial).

But yea sterile water seems a bit hard to come by, unless you buy the sharps kits to get it cheaply as I think their government subsidized, sort of would had to be for the price they come at( 5 x 1ml Terumo insulin syringes 1 x 10ml water for injection 5 x Antiseptic Wipes 5 x Filters 1 x Disposal Container for $3.5 or I think their $4 from the vending machines as opposed to pharmacy) 

Anyway my dad is back from hospital recovering from a crazy infection that almost took him and now has two IV lines into his arm and has to take a drip of antibiotics twice a day. Pretty cool they let him out of the hospital and let him hook himself up, was just such a trip to walk into the bathroom when I came to visit and see all these needle tips, sterile water containers, syringes and drip bags haha. He's doing real well though so no need to worry.",1387127770.0

So, my most terrifying moment would have to be this one night, I had a couple hundred bucks, and because I couldn't drive, I had a girl I knew come sneak me out, in her grandfathers truck, that she had stolen. So, were on our way to pick up, when I notice she is straight fucked, she had take 15 hydros, and was nodding all over herself while driving. So I'm really nervous, I'm in WDS, and just about to shit my pants, and the whole time, it's just pouring rain outside. So 45 minutes, and 3 heart attacks later, we arrive at her friends house to pick him up, because it's his connection were going through. When we go back outside to leave, the road is completely flooded.. Were terrified because we both have to be home in 4 hours, so our folks don't find out we were out. So, stupidly we try to drive through the flood. We go about 20 feet, before water starts pouring into the car, and there's nearly a foot of water in the bottom of the vehicle, and were completely stuck. So after 5 minutes of siting there, watching the water pour in, I say fuck it, and floor it, and miraculously, I find the road, and start to gain some ground against the river that was flowing against us.. After about 1 minute of teeth clenching pure terror, were finally starting to get out of the water and back on some higher ground. So, after that we decide we can't make it all the way to pick up, and decide to stop, and see if one of her other friends happens to have anything. Turns out, she had meth and kpins, so I smoked a bowl of meth, and took two kpins, and headed for home, as the sun came up over the cornfields.. I walk inside, and lay down.. Not 2 minutes later, my dad walks in, and says it's time to get up, and go see my drug counselor.. I literally have never been that scared in my entire life since that night.

I recently got some #3 and I'm having some trouble smoking it. Any help would be appreciated

I put it on the foil in a line and then run the lighter under it (trying to hold it further away). Smoke does produce but it pretty much instantly turns to black. I've read about trying to run the H down the foil as you're smoking it to get the vapour but how are you meant to do that if its in a line?

Should I start my H on the foil in a pile or in a line? Also I'm using a piece of a soda bottle so I catch more of the smoke because I'm not good enough to use a tooter yet.

I figured the members of /r/opiates are all pass the gay/gross plugging comments and opinions unlike most forums, so I thought this an appropriate place to ask for advice, opinions or experiences on this unusual topic.

So here it goes: 

I ran out of fresh rigs a few nites back. I wasn't willing to reuse as the only rig I had left, had been used twice not cleaned and left sitting for 2 days with dried blood and a clogged needle. All pharmacies where closed by this point. 

I instead resorted to plugging my H, for fucks sakes. It was the best alternative that I had (or so I thought). My withdrawals were so shitty at that point the waste seemed worth it. 

Now I plug dillies a lot, more than IV in fact because I don't really like injecting those wax beads we get here in Canada. 30% of the time I inject a pill I get a vein collapse or huge painful rash, never with H. 

Dillies plugged are amazing!!!!! No extreme rush like IV of course, but I get em cheap and 20 bucks to get flying high is OK by me! Lasts longer too up the bum in my opinion.

Back to the H going up my ass; I tried it once years before when I was a chipper and feared the needle. It didn't work at all. I chocked it up to; too much poo, too little H and improper technique (first plug attempt).

This time I knew what I was doing and I wanted to fly.
I took a massive poo that morning after an opiate binge and gave myself an enema that nite just to be safe which cleared out a lot too.

I proceed to plug a fucking half gram of awesome powder H and laid on my left side like I do for dillies. 

5 minutes pass, would have felt hydromorphone by now.

10 minutes pass, still nothing

20 minutes on my side and I start loosing my shit knowing I just essentially poured $100 bucks up my ass for nothing.

So why does my rectum absorb dillies even with a constipated log loaded, but does nothing with a lot of very good H in a very clean rectum?

Any thoughts? Experiences to share? Advice?

Just pl let me know if I'm missing something important here!

I'm a 23-year-old who was injured working out two years ago and knocked my sacroiliac joint out of alignment. In addition to the muscle spasms from the joint disfunction, the muscles in my hip are chronically inflamed causing the sciatic nerve and femoral nerves to be pinched, so I'm pretty much miserable 24/7 - dependence on opiates has been the result. 

I know there are forums for people with chronic pain on Reddit, but you guys seem really accepting and full of valuable information.

**Update1**: She was given narcan (obviously), and she's kinda there. Low pulse and oxygen. Bf tried to wake her and tell her that he's talking to me, and she smiled and mumbled something about reddit lol. I'll take it, for now.

**Update2**: I should be getting another update from the bf tomorrow. He's all torn up about it, they'd been having their issues. It's a wakeup call for him too, learning not to take things for granted.

""I went in the living room to see if she was there and she was on the floor. I can't forgive myself. I wont be able to forget the way she looked laying there.""

Think about it peeps. There's always someone who'll hurt at your passing.

**Update3**: She died last night. For four minutes, then they got her back. She's doing much better now, but they won't even let her have her phone, so I'm still talking to the bf. But it looks like she's out of the woods.

**Update4**: Probably last one. Talked to /u/you_gottabe_kidding herself, she's gonna be alright. Feels shitty as hell, but she's gonna pull through. Thanks for the thoughts and prayers and juju everyone, glad this one didn't end as badly as it could have.",1387334347.0

He was super nice & he didn't try to get me to fuck him for free shit.  He treated me like a real person.  My week was running out & my choice was the east coast or homeless.  


Anyways he said I could crash him as long as I look for a job.  Two rules keep the house clean & no free dope.  Great deal & he just slings a little bit.  I met some of his friends & all the girls were super nice to me.  Usually girls are cunts to me & they wanted to hangout and shit.


He sucks at answering his phone so they are hitting me up.  I'm confused why he's fucking lagging so hard.  And I tell one of the girls sorry that I missed her call & he's on his way. She sends back ""MY bad I'm
Not trying to bug you :/ ""


I was so confused then it hits me.  I'm on the inside, he's the fucking dealer that takes forever.  Then he hits me with some deep shit when I give him shit.  Every time he goes out there it might be his last & that's why he lags.

i can manage a pretty normal life being high everyday, i dont let my addiction take over my willpower, i always make short term goals and long term goals that i can realistically accomplish.

Be careful y'all. I'm getting em taken care of, but no painkillers or nothing :/ got aleve and aspirin. Maybe a tylenol3 if I'm lucky

Even worse , none of my friends have this problem. Maybe it's my mono? Weakened immune system and everything?? It just sucks. And i'm stupid, and feel dirty and dumb. One of the only times I've severely regretted shooting. Or using.

1t8ahp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1t8ahp/loperamide_od/,36,https://redd.it/1t8ahp,TheEndd,Loperamide OD,"Hey guys,
Ok so here is the scoop, for past three days me and my girlfriend moved to my mom and have been withdrawing from opiates. My mom is very open and understanding of my choices in life and when I told her my situation she told me she already knew. I told her we wanted her help in order to get off of opiates and be able to afford things other then drugs. So for the first two days things were fantastic. We literally had no withdraw symptoms at all. I would also like to mention that when we told my mom we wanted to get clean the first thing she did was ask what we needed in order to get through these initial withdraws. To Walmart we went to get those magical pills that not only stop massive shits but also shitty withdraws. Either way, throughout the first two days we weren't really monitoring our intake. We were probably taking around twenty of the 2 mg pills ever 4 or 5 hours or so. Any ways, on the second night, I take my last dose. Took about 30 of them. Come the next morning I wake up in an ambulance driving me to the nearest hospital.I had no idea what was happening. At first I thought I had unknowingly got dressed at nigh and went out to a bar and got roofied or something. So anyways the paramedics are asking me the usual questions, ""where do I live, what is my social?"" Things of that nature. Come to find out my girlfriend woke up and found my breathing really shallow on my bed. She immediately slapped me and tried to wake me up. When that didn't work she went and got my mom. My moms first thought was that I had picked up some norcos again and that I had OD'ed when I didn't. Apparently the paramedics had to hit me with narcan in order to get me to stabilize. I dont know what the fuck happened. I didn't do anything other then try and better my life and all I get is half a day feeling like absolute shit in a hospital room. Either way the moment I woke up and started remembering my name and what had happened the night before I starting forcing myself to move. Not only physical but mentally. I was doing math in my head while simultaneously trying to do toe touches in the ambulance I have never heard this happening to anyone. So please, if you have share your story and make me feel like I am not just some random anomaly. By the way, I know it wasn't technically called an OD, it was classified as being poisoned. But I was still shot with Narcan and that shit made me feel worse then anything in my entire life. Please and thank you for all of your responses if there is any. I am completely done with opiates after this. If Lope almost took my out I am never risking putting Hydro in m bod again. No judgment here though. Happy nods and may your next adventure be a safe one.

tl;dr:didn't wake up after taking loperamide, paramedics administered a shot of narcan. Woke up while in an ambulance while being treated like shit all because I was trying to withdraw on my own instead of subs or methadone. ",1387433264.0

Is there anything I've missed?

----------

Ok so first of all you're going to need to make sure you're in a reasonable sized town. That might sound obvious but you'd be amazed the number of people I've seen complain that they can't find anyone when their local population contains more farm animals than people.

So with that done, it's time to hit Google. Check all of the following searches:
1. Where to buy heroin in [town]  
2. [town] needle exchange  
3. [town] methadone clinic  
4. [town] drugs project  
Now a quick explanation:  
1. Obviously you're not going to get anything specific here, but a lot of times it will tell you which parts of the town has the worst drugs problems, which is where you'll want to go to cop.   
2. Most towns have loads of exchanges that are nothing more than a standard pharmacy, you're looking for the main one. More on this later.  
3. Same as 2.  
4. I don't know if this is true for all towns, but I know there's the Manchester drugs project, Bolton drugs project and the Bristol drugs project. These will almost always be the main needle exchange, the main Methadone clinic, everything. This is where you want to start.

Now you know where to go, but before you bolt out the door make sure you're carrying the **bare minimum**, and I really mean that. No wallet (just take £20 and your bank card), ideally no car keys (f they get taken and you have 1 of those remote blippers, you can bet your ass they'll find your car) and if you can manage it, a cheap, old phone with just enough credit to make a few calls. If you haven't got an old phone then bring your current phone, but just go careful.

So, time to hit the streets.  
Head to the towns drug project, go inside and ask for the exchange. It doesn't matter what you get, all you really want is to see what bags the exchange give people. Now if you see ANYONE coming out of the building with 1 of these bags, you pretty much know they are actively using (nothing worse than asking someone who's been clean for 5 years to score for you lol...).  
Next up, find somewhere you can sit for a while without looking suspicious and just watch / listen to the people coming out of the building.  
Personally I'd play it safe and only go with someone who's got an exchange bag (remember this is a building full of addicts, chances are a lot of them would rob you without a second thought), but it's up to you.  
Once you've found someone that looks promising, wait for them to get out of earshot of the entrance (but not too far away, it should be obvious to them why you've approached), I personally just ask them if they know where to score round here.  
You're going to have to use your best judgement here because, some of them will probably see you as an easy target (presuming you're young-ish and white, like myself heh), some will hook you up but try to make something off of you on every sale, and then some of them will just help you and introduce you to a dealer - fingers crossed for the latter!  
If they seem a bit reluctant, offer to buy them a bag in return for helping you out, I've never seen that approach fail heh :)  
At this point the only thing that needs stressing is the importance of getting the dealers number as well as theirs. You don't want to be middle manning through them every time, you want a direct connect to the drugs!

Other than that all the usual rules apply; only buy 1 and 1 for your helper (if it's good then of course get more, but it pays to presume everyone is out to con you until proven otherwise heh), do not ever, ever, **ever** give over money until the drugs are in front of you (no stories as to why they have to just run into this 1 house etc, if they insist on this they are most likely trying to rob you), basically just use a bit of common sense and you should be fine :)

Finally if for some reason the above doesn't work you've got 2 backup options; 1 is to walk around the areas you found to have high numbers of drug problems and just ask people that look like users (definitely the most risky, this should be your last resort) or you can ask a homeless person. I'd open with offering to either buy them a bag or give them £10, what ever they prefer, that should get things sorted quickly :)

I hope that's helped, just remember to stay calm, think things through before acting, don't give out money (*eeevvveeerrrrr!!!!* :p)and don't be afraid to just walk away from a situation if it starts to look bad.

Good luck, if you've got any other questions feel free to PM me :)",1387417858.0

I started off young with the whole clubbing; dropping E's doing speed 3 days a week and generally experimenting with everything i could get my hands on. 

I idolised Pete Doherty at the time, for those who don't know him he is the lead frontman of The Libertines and The Babyshambles and was also a chronic heroin user. I'd always told myself and my friends I wouldn't touch heroin and we'd joke about the idiocy of users- yet somehow I unconsciously knew one day I'd be an addict.

I'd sit on the toilet and fantasise about administering a shot whilst taking a shit, i'd think about heroin constantly. After looking up heroin on the internet, reading stories, experiences i suppose that i have become completely desensitised to the word HEROIN.

So fast forward a few years, Im using tramadol and CWE'ing codeine from OTC meds daily. One of the days shopping in Walsall town centre ,I see a haggered, rough looking dude on a bike with scratches and shit all over his face. I approach him and get 2x bags of brown powder heroin. Im shaking and i feel pretty ashamed with myself that it came to this. Still- a day later im back on the phone to the guy getting more and more. 

This is half a year ago, im now using everyday. As i write this i am holding an ice pack over a histamine reaction on my hand where I've missed a shot. This is the first time in a while i have sat back and assessed the direction my life has turned and i cant help but think how I predicted it all in my head and the scary thing is; it doesnt even bother me. The heroin is a warm blanket of reassurance that walks with me everywhere, the comfort of a mother thats lifts the weight of the world from my shoulders. 

I used to be a good kid, playing with toy guns at the park where my mum would take me everyday, dressing up as batman and playing with my toy soldiers in the dirt- and now I sit in front of a computer 9 hours a day wishing the day away until i can get back home. 

Anyway, thanks for listening. I have no one in my life that knows about my secret masquerade (sp?) and it feels good to put this onto 'paper'

It started when I got a script for clonz and adderall from my family doc. I was taken off them only a month later when I started seeing a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist refused to scribe me anything, and stupidly I granted permission for each doc to correspond with one another about my medical info. 

So now my psychiatrist tells my family doc he shouldn't have prescribed me those drugs in the first place, and theirs now way I'm going to get anything from either. Fuck!

Then I get an idea! 

I take the empty script bottles to a walk in clinic and say: ""I'm leaving on a trip tomorrow and can't see my doc in time to get a refill"". Bullshit Bullshit Bullshit etcetera etcetera...

It fucking worked! Full refill of both scripts!

Obviously this doc wasn't going to keep doing this. He only did it because he thought he'd only have too once anyways.

So a few days later onto another walk in clinic. She didn't buy it and turned me away.

I continued doing this for a good year, traveling up to 3 hours away to find new docs. 

Roughly 1 in 3 would give me something. Sometimes only adderall, sometimes only clonz, and occasionally; ritalin, loraz and other alternative benzos and stims. As long as I had a bottle from another doc they felt OK with it for the most part.

If I hit 5 docs in one day I was swimming in pills! I had more clonz than I could literally take.

After about a year of this I found a doc who would continually prescribe me both. Kinda shady, but all the better for me. I stopped shopping at this point.

A month later I get a call. It's the fucking police! They want me to come in for questioning... refuse to tell me why over the phone. I decide it's best to comply (and so should you!!).

I go to the station I'm directed too. I get walked into a small office and the door is closed behind me. I wait. Longest wait of my life! I couldn't see out of the office and must have been in there for an hour.

Now up to this point in my life, I've been involved in plenty of drug related criminal activity. Probably enough to put me in prison for over a year. I had no idea what doctor shopping even was at the time. I was 18 and ignorant. I was shitting my self trying to think of what I was booked for.

In comes a man dressed in a suit. Sits down. Opens an envelope and pulls out some papers. hands them to me and says nothing. Looking back it was like a fucking movie seen.

I gain my composure and start deciphering the tables of info on the  papers in front of me. 

I quickly come to the conclusion it's a list of at least 40 doctors names with corresponding prescription records and dates. Oh shit.

The police investigator sitting across from me starts telling me about doctor shopping an what a serious offense it is. He was actually a very nice guy but was trying to relay the gravity of the situation.

He starts telling me about the prison time I could be doing! Scares the shit out of me with possible charges and fines I could incur.

He then leans over and says: ""Fortunately for you; you seemed to have stopped a month before your 18th birthday"". 

Didn't even think of that as I was obviously 18 by this point!

Of course they could have still sent me somewhere and charged me as a minor, but I think he believed I genuinely didn't now it was illegal and was so scared I'd never do it again. 

Haven't gotten either drug from a doc since. 

I've always wondered what the cop would think if he knew that I just get it them on the streets now. Much easier that way.






EDIT: 

I really can't understand you guys who have had bad experiences with cops, stereotyping them all as horrible people.

My brother was caught with a gram of coke and had several 8balls planted on him by the arresting officer to attach intent to distribute. After a month in jail my brother was released because the officer failed to produce documented drugs from a previous bust.

That cop abused his power.

Another cop could have let my father (who he knew was a junkie scum bag) die in a burning car but decided to get third degree burns and risk his own life pulling him out instead.

He was one of the kindest most intelligent men I've ever met.

Your all talking about them fucking you over to get what they want. How many times have you fucked someone over to get drugs or money for drugs? At least there doing it to get there idea of justice. However twisted.

THey'd give me confidence, productivity, happiness, a carefree attitude feeling like I can take on the whole world... they make me feel like who I'm supposed to be and I want them. Every day, I want them.

Because the days I don't have them feel like shit and I'm stuck in my own head, being anxious, worrying about stuff that isn't there, and embracing emotions that don't matter.

I know NA has taught me that I can't be free until I stop using, but what if using is the only thing that makes me free from myself?",1387392943.0

My bff, AnotherAllTimeLow made a post a few days ago about me ODing on heroin. I don't know many of you, but I feel like us addicts are all connected some way, and I just wanted to say I'm sorry for my foolish behavior. I have read so many threads on here about one of us ODing, and I know that feeling. Even if you have never even talked to the person, it makes you sick to your stomach when you read it. I'm sorry I made such a stupid decision, and that I caused anyone to worry. I know it didn't keep you up at night or anything, but coming back after being dead makes you look at everything a little bit differently. I immediately wanted to apologize to every person i had ever done wrong. I thought I had checked everyone off the list....then I remembered you fuckers. :) I'm really, really bored and can't sleep....the nurses are limiting my 'phone time' (it apparently makes me too emotional. Ha) but I managed to get it from my SO, so of course I came straight here. I am having some serious withdrawals. Which i cant complain about considering its my own fault....but good god the arm/leg pain and cold sweats are horrible. 
I also wanted to say thank you to everyone who wished me well. Its nice that people I have never even met were worried. In the past few months when I just couldn't seem to find a happy second in the day, y'all were my entertainment....I knew I could come to r/opiates and get a few good laughs. Seriously, y'all tell some of the funniest and fucked up shit I have ever heard. So again, thanks for being a breath of fresh air when I was suffocating. I love you guys....even y'all I don't know. :) I am especially thankful to /u/AnotherAllTimeLow. You helped me more than you will ever know. At a time when I needed it most. Its amazing that a complete stranger took so much time and effort into giving me such great advice, and making me laugh a lot! I'm just so sorry I didn't listen and follow your instructions as closely as I should have. Your messages were what I looked forward to during the day. Something that seems so small kept me from doing this weeks ago. 
I'm rambling....at least I can still think and make the words though! If anyone has any advice on what I should expect in the comming days and how to deal with it, I could use some help on this. Or if anyone who has ODed (whether you died or not) wants to share their story I would love to read it. It would make me feel better and not so alone in this.",1387530857.0

Well he was supposed to go home but instead stayed around the area and met up with some people who had completed treatment at his rehab. He asked one of them about their pharmacists location then picked up prescriptions in her name for benzos (which she doesn't abuse and is in recovery) meaning that she had to pay for them.

He overdosed on Thursday, I just found out. He was calling some sober friends of mine asking them if they wanted drugs off him. 

Really crazy shit, no one really expected him to have died and more so, no one really thought it was possible to die so suddenly after being in the game for years and years. It just goes to show no matter how much experience you have this WILL take you out the game one way or another.

I've always been really really methodical about my use and always chalked it up to a scientific process. But it doesn't matter, I ended up slipping with that and nearly died as a result.

* Ok, onward!  Here are a couple shots of the dope  itself.  It is definitely on the lighter end of the spectrum color wise for this particular d-boy, but still absolute fire.  I also managed to swing by a gas station on the way home to snag a coke freeze and a couple donuts: [Dope 'n Donuts](http://i.imgur.com/to76HSV.jpg)and [the only type of gator tails I was looking to partake in tonight.](http://i.imgur.com/ADo4Hoi.jpg)

We'll make it ourselves, and pass off a bit to some close friends, but mostly keep it for personal consumption.  At any rate, I haven't done the QWISO in a while, had some loud, and a lot of keef that I hadn't used, so I went for it.  Here is a shot of it after about six hours drying, with another 18 or so to go before it is ready to be scraped  and pressed, and then another 12-18 hours under some heavy ass weight before it will be ready for the vape pens: [QWISO](http://i.imgur.com/aEs8HLB.jpg)

Well, I doubt anyone is really keeping up with this since it's late, but if you are, perhaps you can empathize with me. Arrived home. Obtained dope via removal of pan, did a victory dance (Disclosure's essential mix has been in for last hour, so lots if grooving actually), and proceed inside for victory celebration. Arrive at desk, pull out glass surface, bags, empty one, and think ""well, that is pretty white for dope...it couldn't be, could it?""  SON OF A FUCKING BITCH, IT IS BLOW.  Back to the trap...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've been working on some writing tonight, some poems and a couple short stories, and have found a great flow. I've finished 1st and 3rd drafts respectively for the short stories, and 4 poems in a series I what I think will be 8-10. If you have a creative hobby or skill, you know that the times of creative abundance aren't the norm, and the periods of absolute creative excess come sparingly.  Definitely happening tonight, and didn't want to risk losing it overnight.

I keep a pretty extensive and awesome (IMO) on hand collection of substances, and had both some speed and crystal for the energy boost to stay awake. No thanks Tina, you just make my writing weird, but the speed will do. If I'm gonna take some speed, I might as well go ahead and assume that mindset of sheer invincibility with some dope too. Oh no, was out.

Fortunately the d-boy is a 24/7 shop and I'm over there in 20 min. Grab my g, hang out to smoke a blunt, and then off again. By now, the speed has kicked in, and my paranoia levels are a bit higher than normal. Just feeling like my reg stash spot isn't gonna be safe enough, so I search around for something new and improved.  

Ended up dropping the dope behind a panel in my car. Fingers can't reach it. Kinda concerned, you guys. Can see the tip if bag, but not sure what sitch is like behind panel. Keep your fingers crossed for me until I make if home and can utilize some tape on a hanger to grab this thing. If that fails, the whole panel is off, I hope. 

Feeling like an idiot. ",1387613157.0

I was on a Suboxone program for a little over a year and I've been off the Subs now for roughly 10 days. I tapered from 16mg daily to 2mg daily and jumped. I was of course prescribed clonidine, promethazine, lomotil and some Klonopin as ""comfort meds."" Surprisingly, I've had little to no physical symptoms to speak or complain about besides some diarrhea, some restless extremities and obviously some insomnia. Suffice to say, I was horrified by everything I had heard about coming off Buprenorphine and expected to suffer, especially jumping from 2mg as I did(I was dosing 2mg daily, my last dose was 1mg). I know it has a ridiculously long half life and thought that perhaps the buprenorphine was taking its time leaving my system and that I still had to deal with whatever was coming to me, however, at day 10 I have to say I feel ""not too bad."" I've been forcing myself to leave the house just for small errands and it exhausted me. 

I'm going to assume that the lomotil is acting similarly to loperamide in terms of dealing with withdrawals. My question is, having been physically addicted to the buprenorphine or rather being addicted to a partial agonist and successfully withdrawn from it, how soon again could I smoke some black without running the risk of undoing the 10 days, or rather, would smoking ""just once,"" put me back into the throes of withdrawal. 

Please keep in mind that I'm not asking about precipitated withdrawals as I won't be taking Suboxone again. I simply would like to know if smoking some tar will or will not trick my brain into thinking it's getting what it ""needs"" and thus, making me once again physically dependent on a full-agonist opioid, or the earliest I could smoke without becoming physically dependent once more. 

I like to watch TV or movies while I nod, occasionally listen to music, depressing shit, but I fucking love it. It's my favorite time of the year to smoke, I was hoping to nod to the Sherlock series 3 premiere at the latest (I remember the series 2 premiere, good times), which premieres on the 1st, which would be 20 days off of the subs but there are circumstances keeping me from enjoying the .6g I picked up last night whenever I want.

Any advice or comments would be appreciated. 

Thanks.",1387587619.0

While I was walking to my car, I was thinking about the dream. I realized that -- morbidly enough -- having enough drugs to kill myself is a really comforting thought -- not because I want to die, but because it means I have a *lot* of drugs. It's a sort of standard size for a stash to achieve.

So last night, I picked up a very small amount of meth, and 6 1mg xanaxs. Well I took a couple and was on my way home, in very in climate weather, and I slid off the road, and flipped my car three times, so as soon as I stopped rolling, I grabbed the two packages, both in cigarette cellophane, and shoved em up my keister, thinking it would only be for a little bit. However, after an hour long ride to the hospital, stripped naked besides my boxers, and all my clothes looked through for belongings, I was happy to be let go. One problem. I went into the bathroom to retrieve my drugs from my bum, and they were so far up, I couldn't even come close to getting to them.. So, about 4 hours later, I'm home, really really beat up, and wanting to get high, so I give myself an enema, with an oral syringe and water. I then, proceed to squirt the water out on the floor. (Yes I cleaned up) however what happened next horrified me.. It almost look like small boogers covered in blood were coming out. I got worried, but continued.. When I finally dished out the smaller sealed package, it was COVERED in blood, so I set it aside and continued. However, next time, it looked like drops of pure blood were falling out of my rectum.. It's not horrible, but it's painful, and worrying. Any ideas besides a doctor? Considering I totaled the living fuck out of my car. And no I wasn't high and driving.. ",1387643462.0

First. Soldering iron. At least 900 degrees is what I was told. The Weller brand makes one with a triangle of built in LEDs arranged evenly around the grip's apex that aim down the barrel. Google it to have a picture in mind so you see how this works. The light allows you to see and catch any missed smoke (hah noobs). 

You just tap tap tap a piece roughly the size of your keyboard's lowercase o +/- to taste onto the hot barrel, NOT the tip. The actual part used for pressing hot solder is not what we want. We want the outside assembly surrounding and before that tool.  

As a 'dabber' I use a nail. Paperclips don't hold the tar well enough (mass of it, dripping, too thin). You can stab a ball, wrap a snake around the nail's tip, get creative and find what you like best. It plumes up seriously quick and is much denser than that of a foil user's. Stay right on top of it, and don't really drag or run it down, just tap, tap, tap.  Again, experiment with what you like best. You will alter the angle where tapping contact is made b/w tar and iron as the tar is used up, and from there the other plane inclinations will become evident. Basically thought just stay right on top of it, maybe a little behind, and stick to small taps at first. Takes practice forsure, you have to inhale pretty damn hard. 

The very bottom of the barrel that connects into the grip (think full tang knife) doesn't get hot enough so don't bother with that area. You will want to use a relatively fat tooter. Scrape off any remnants, and refresh. The way you hold the iron isn't of much importance, the tooter and inhalation control is more important. 

You will have to use about a point to get the coating off of the metal if bought one new from a store. 

This got me thinking about heating coil playtime. The paper clip on paper clip method I've read about worked but was sort of a pain with such a small surface area. Tips here are welcome, but I don't think it really works too well. 

If you're still reading, this is where it gets good. 

Use a paperclip (either an unfolded one or the curve in one) and tap that shit on your car's cigarette lighter. **bold**mm-mm-mm-mm-mmmmmm, toasty.**bold** Very dense hits, and shit man its your car's cig lighter. think of the possibilities. Paperclips are also disposable paraphernalia. Timing and insulation are important with all of these styles of smoking, I recommend insulating your nail with electrical tape. After say 3 little bits smoked, I guess the cig lighter would smolder after being plugged back into the car for reheating. Maybe the actual receiver itself, I don't know, it was dark. 

So its essentially doing a dab of hash, but junkie style. An acquaintance of mine uses a glass bowl with the bowl broken inward, a glass rod, and a blowtorch to do something similar. 

New toys new toys. These hits are exponentially better than foil ones.

Since we give ourselves the luxury of feeling awesome, greatness sometimes follows.

My shining moments while under the influence:

2012: Donned a Pac-Man bedsheet with eyeholes, ""haunted"" my neighborhood in November.

2013: Irate that my subdivision doesn't raise or lower the American and North Carolina flags, I made a new one out of an old blanket to fly on the vacant 3rd pole. It said simply, ""TITTIES"". They now pay attention to the flags. 

I believe these things more than make up for the time I got drunk in Applebee's while dressed as Lady Gaga on Halloween and bawled, inconsolable, in a booth with my friends because I found out Trent Reznor got married.

Amuse me. Tell me what debauchery made your 'fuck yeah, I'm cool as fuck' mental list you keep inside your head. Don't lie. You have one.

It's a shit gig at a sandwich place. So I saunter out of there around noon because there was too many employees. Lovely... The gears are rolling into place & I haven't gotten high in three days so the anticipation begins to well up. I feel like the smoothest cat in that place. Tracks lingering on my arms. All the girls think I'm bad. All the guys don't know what to think about me. I definitely walk out of there feeling pretty good about myself, rip open my check, & what the fuck. It's just enough for a half gram. One dollar more actually. Unacceptable, but I'll make it work as the cogs are now in motion & that feeling in my stomach starts to accumulate.

 I start walking towards my humble abode. My mom just got into town last night so I must weave her into my plans, sleazy as that is. She's out shopping with my girlfriend, her boyfriend, and his mom. I put on some Lou Reed (Velvet Underground & Nico) and start flipping through numbers trying to figure out who would want to be a part of my Christmas miracle in the form of a ride. I make some calls and sit back and wa...wait. Where the fuck am I going to cash a check Christmas Eve?

 An hour later, no response from any of my transportation options and little hope for my check being cashed. Morale is sinking fast. We ride around with my mom for what seems like hours trying to find some phantom specific gift for her boyfriend that no one seems to carry. No banks are open. Not even the Walmart bank. We get ahold of the ride, he says great. We get ahold of the connection, all is solid. Then with a sudden burst of clarity it comes to me. Payday advance joint. After some heavy searching we find one that is operating until six. After slight cajoling I manage to convince my mom to drive us there under pretenses of Christmas funds. They take 3% so the margin is painfully close but we can work with that.

 We get my lovely dear mother to drop us off at our friends house. After a goodbye and agreement upon which time we rendezvous tomorrow, the daylong wild goose chase and it's ups and downs which I left out for the most part is adjourned. Through impossible odds, the Christmas miracle looks like it is going to happen. Our friend comes out of his apartment, and we pile into his beater car with a loose muffler for a journey to the ghetto. After winding and such through the iced over roads we make it to our middle woman's house. An old black lady who is veritably loony. Loony as she may be, she has never done us wrong and always has the dopest dope around. She has multiple connects on her phone, and can always get what we need. All for the low fee/insurance of 10$. No sack pinched ever, no wait, no bullshit. Very worth it in this city. We drive to the actual spot, get our shit & the miracle has happened.

 Now back to our friends roach infested apartment. After more meaningless driving and an anticipation level that is absolutely off the charts we arrive. The spoons are loaded, Burroughs ""A Junkies Christmas"" is put on youtube, and all is well with the fucked up world. I bought a bottle of fiji water because the wound botulism story. I also wanted to shoot with pristine mountain water. Warm intense relief rushes over me like a horizontal hot bath. Everything is right with the world, and will be all through Christmas day. Otherwise I'm not sure how I would deal with all the people. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight.  I hope you cats all got yours. ",1387950174.0

Yesterday, I took 0.25mg sublingually. I felt sedated, but otherwise okay for the first 6 hours. Then I began to sweat, and was overcome by the most intense nausea. I eventually slept, but am still feeling mildly nauseous now, 24 hours later. 

Questions: 

1. I am traditionally very med-sensitive. Coupled with my lack of opiate experience, is it possible 0.25mg was too much for me?

2. The strips expired 2 months ago. I read that shouldn't be an issue, but could it be?

3. I took 6-12mg of Codeine for about 3 days, and stopped 3 days before starting the Suboxone. Is it possible some might have still been in my system?

1tqc99,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1tqc99/update_on_my_situation_for_those_that_care/,22,https://redd.it/1tqc99,SpecialSause,Update on my situation (for those that care),"Well, I still have no idea what we are going to do for a place to stay.  I still don't know what we're going to do for income other than trying to apply for unemployment and SSDI.  I was very, very sad that they waited until the week before Christmas to tell my wife that she was unemployed as we hadn't had the money to even start to buy Christmas presents at that point.  FUCK!  So when I wrote that first, panicked post, we had no money and no Christmas presents for either of our children.

Well, I am happy to say that my brother and his wife sent 2 presents, my mom sent a present but it won't be here for another couple of days, and there is a private school that is interested in my son  because he's in Kindergarten and reading chapter books and doing algebraic equations already (although the school is expensive and we can't pay for it for obvious reasons) and they went above and beyond and were able to give both my son and daughter a few presents.

So Christmas wasn't completely disastrous.  Both my kids seemed happy.  My son was happy with what he got and I'm grateful that they were able to do that for him.  I felt awful that we weren't able to get him anything more.  There's so much that I wanted to get him.  But he was happy and that's what matters the most.

Of course there was family drama as there always is whenever we do anything with my wife's mom and dad.  My wife's mother has Capgras Delusions where she thinks that members of her family are being replaced by doppelgangers.  I kid you not.  It's frustrating and scary.  She refuses to get help and my wife's father refuses to get her help because he's terrified that if he takes her to get help that they will lock her away in a mental hospital.  But she needs help; more help than any of us are able to give.  

Because she isn't getting help, she is stressing my wife out with the things she does.  At one point when my daughter was 3 or 4 months old, my wife's mother accused me of trying to suffocate my daughter on purpose and then frame her (my wife's mother) for it.  She says I smiled at her before I walked out the door (supposedly right after I tried suffocating my daughter).  Of course my daughter was crying which clearly indicates that she was breathing and not suffocating.

Anyway, the drama that occurred today was that she was here at our house and she started going through our stuff when we were in the living room and not paying attention to her.  Well, while she was going through our stuff, she came across a book that I gave to my wife a while ago that is ""The Encyclopedia or Witchcraft and Demonology"" because my wife has recently started to identify as herself as Pagan and that stuff fascinates her.  My wife's mother is Christian and she flipped her fucking lid for no reason.  She comes out yelling ""SO NOW YOU'RE PRACTICING DEMONOLOGY!""  Which just shows she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about because you don't ""practice Demonology"".  But I digress.

My wife doesn't even do any of the ""witchcraft"" or any stuff like that anyway.  It's just subjects that she is fascinated by and I bought her some literature about it.  My wife tried to stop it before it went any further.  She told her ""Just stop.  I'm not arguing with you about it.""  And her mom started yelling ""When did you start getting into this witchcraft and demonology?""  Which my wife pointed out that she asked ""WHEN"" instead of ""WHY"" because she's trying to figure out ""WHEN"" my wife was replaced by a doppelganger.  And just to make things worse, my wife's dad was sitting in the chair and just says ""you reap what you sow"" which my wife retorted back to him ""that's ironic that you say that considering that 's a 'Pagan' saying"".

At first, I wasn't sure why her father would even say ""You reap what you sow"".  I wasn't quite grasping the context in which he meant it.  It was later that talking with my wife and him that we later realized that he was telling her that her being Pagan and practicing Demonology (which she's not but that point is moot) is the reason she lost her job.  If she were Christian, she would still have her job.

The sad part is that 2 years ago, we moved away from my family from Florida up to Maryland so that our children could be closer to my wife's parents.  However, because of my wife's Paganism and my wife's mother's unchecked mental illness, my wife's parents have minimal exposure to my children and they have almost no relationship.  And my wife has said several times in the past couple of years that if she would have known it was going to be this way that she never would have moved up here.  She just knew that my parents had an awesome relationship with our children and she just wanted her parents to have that as well.  The reason being that my parents have 3 other grandchildren besides my 2 children (5 total) while my 2 children are the only two grandchildren that my wife's parents have.  That is why we chose to move up here and have our children closer to her parents.  Unfortunately, that hasn't been the case and the only thing that our closer vicinity has done is strain the parental-daughter relationship of my wife and her parents and has not strengthened the bond between my children and her parents whatsoever.

After 3-4 months of use however, I noticed my skin becoming dry and scaly. The skin on my knuckles is raw, scaly, dried out, and peeling. The ends of my finger tips are also becoming dry and they are in pain and feel like the skin is dry and feels tight and like they are splitting...WTF! I have never seen this before, or heard of it. My friends that are using with me are having the same thing happen!

I know this shit is coming from the Mexicans as I know the Mexican lady who is bringing the shit to the valley. Is it probable that they have been rethinking their approach to heroin and have started crudely processing codeine into desomorphine? I imagine it's cheaper and easier to do. The cartel probably has the connections to get pure, raw codeine and from there it's just like baking a cake.

Has anyone else seen this ""pure,"" heavenl shit floating around and have u been having issues with your skin? I love this amazing quality, but i don want my body to die while it's still wrapped around my living organs and brain.

What would everyones suggestions be on how to handle a situation where you're meeting up with someone you don't know?

What are some red flags?

At what point do you know that you're not dealing with an undercover and are good to discuss illicit activity with this person?

I'm OCD about chopping that ish up, and will sit there for 30+ min getting the particles as small as possible) chopped powders up them?

Is there a specific timeline of use I should be sticking to that will also mitigate potential problems?  That is, is there a threshold point like 3 months of continued use that if I were to continue, the chance of encountering issues is substantially higher than if I were to take a break then? Something I should've probably asked first, what are the potential issues which I could encounter as a result of my preferred ROA?  Are any seriously debilitating?  Anything else I should know?

-- Some New Information --

Fired up again this morning, I think there is at least one active opiate ingredient in this mix, since it is removing my withdrawals altogether and giving me a bit of a buzz (nothing spectacular).

My question is, could there be dilly/fent/hydro/oxymo/hydromo/oxy in this ? It smells like pills and tastes like pills. I want to get a micron filter and see if I can distill a useful mix. I was even thinking about putting all 3 grams left in a shot glass full of water and stirring it over an hour then letting everything fall to the bottom so I can inject real liquid from the top. Several problems exist with this (right amount of water, is this even usable? etc). Right now my method to use involved putting cottons in to take up all the water and precipitates and scraping it all up, then squeegeeing it to another spoon where I can actually draw up the (mostly only liquid at this point) solution and bang.

Not an opiate user, the most I've ever used is hydrocodone from a dentist for a wisdom tooth. 

I'm not asking if I should try it, I'm asking the following question

1. If H is a 10, how close does a line of dilaudid get to the 10 for a non-opiate user?
2. I've heard it doesn't last very long, how long will it be doing things?
3. If a non-opiate user were to take lines, how much would be ""too much,"" and how much would be ""just right?

Thanks folks

(Technically isn't my dope, it's my dads. And some other dude who bought through me) I had to go through my cousin, my other dealer is old news now. Anyways, me and my dads gf just happen to decide to pickup some more narcan before we dose. 

My cousin guaranteed me it was amazing dope... he wasn't kidding. .1 had me on my ass. Now here's where the horribly bad news comes in. Me and my dads gf do a shot in her car. I do mine first, then she does hers. She did .05-.1, and decided that she wanted me to drive. On the way from her walk around the car she falls over. I rush over to her and she has blue lips and is not breathing. I had to use 6cc's of narcan to wake her up and it took five minutes total till she finally took her first breath. During all this time the entire neighbor hood is watching in awe as I'm preforming CPR (just mouth to mouth) and hitting her with 'her medication'.. They call the cops and by the junkie gods this is when she comes through. The GF the 911 operator that she has a condition where she'll have such extreme panic attacks that she passes out. They believed her, and that I the things I injected her with she told them was adrenaline.  

And, something weird happened. The 911 operator on the phone tells her that she's okay to leave this persons house. Thank god she did because I had half a gram in my car and would have been blamed for everything. I rush home, stash my shit. I can barely do a point because this shit is so strong and I do .5 a day of regular dope. 

Bottom line is, this is the third person I've had to use narcan for, and the first time I had to use 6 shots. Stay safe everyone, please do a tester shot before.",1388241996.0

Going to rehab.","Welp. even as i begin to type this and the thought of me entering this process creeps into my head i am beginning to tear up. 

I first took opiates when i was 13, and i am 23 now. It was just psychonautical use of vicodin etc that i had stolen from my grandparents. it was truly great times.

 i ended up going to boarding school for senior year in new hampshire at a very tiny school and stopped abusing opiates. after school i moved to chicago to live with a girl i met there and lived with her opiate free, i moved home in 2010 and my best friend was dealing roxies. i did not touch them for an entire year he tried to get me to smoke them and i took a hit... once weekly use over months slowly became nightly use... 

I live in new york, and there is a new law that is making prescription pills near-impossible to find, and also driving up the cost dramatically. It's called I-stop or something, it prevents dr shopping. 

Due to this, I started copping dope from a friend in town, single stamp bags for 15, i am too ""jewish"" for this and i eventually started getting bundles through a different f(r)iend in town but got middlemanned heavily by him. i eventually got the # of the dealer i was picking up from which went from bundles to eventually me picking up about a quarter oz of raw powder a week (you can see my past posts). i was dealing weed and dope and this enabled me to afford the 800$ qtr oz every week, and i was using atleast half a gram a day having a grand old time. well i just didnt go to math this semester because i'm a doped up motivation-less idiot (passed the other two classes, just barely, c+ and a b)and my mom came home one day when i was cutting class about a month ago or less.. she freaked out on me.. i went to class

i got back and there was a drug test pee cup on the toilet. long story short i came clean to her over the course of a week that i am addicted to opiates. she does not know its heroin although she thinks that for some reason (motherly intuition of some sort) i have told her that its vicodins and oxies etc.. 
i live on long island so we are looking at this place on the north shore that has inpatient or outpatient rehab and detox.

i attempted to quit on my own last week 3 times using kratom, methedone, and immodium, in all different forms and together, not together etc. i lasted 12, 20, and 24 hours, respectively, for each time attempting to quit. I used 120x liquid kratom during the 20 hour one, and i was feeling literally zero physical withdrawals and in fact was slightly buzzed. but all i wanted to do was sniff some powder and feel warm and normal. all  i could think was ""man some dope would be good ONTOP of this"" i literally could not handle any of the mental anguish that i experienced when trying to quit and went out and picked up as quickly as i could after caving( also people hitting you up and you getting free grams of dope essentially out of it doesn't help either. .. )
i have never even been truly sick, only experiencing the first day of withdrawals and hardly that. i honestly am so scared to go through it and suicide to avoid is a fantasy of mine, but something i know i will never commit (but wish i could lol) i just couldn't do that to my mom. 

Also i am a huge pot head and i love to smoke oil and going into rehab i know they will take this away from me : ( so now ontop of quitting dope i have to quit the love of my life, that is not addictive at all. when i am trying to quit dope or have none and am sick i dont even THINK about smoking weed. and didnt for each of those times i tried to quit, i only smoked AFTER i picked up and used. i only sniff and i never have shot up and for some reason i thought that would make my addiction/withdrawals much less so compared to IV use. i figured the horrible withdrawals would only come from IV use, as per usual in my life i am completely fucking wrong. 

I honestly dont know why i'm posting this. I just want to talk to someone about it. I need to talk to someone about it. I know i have to quit. It was and is getting totally out of control. I have to pay a man to feel normal, and that just is not right. But the process of quitting is so utterly horrifying i am crying just typing this. We dont know the time frame yet but it is ASAP, i work at a supermarket and we are trying to find out a way i can get medical leave so i dont get fired. 

oh and if anyone is wondering what's on the line here, if i dont do this and get clean i am homeless. if anyone has any advice you can give it to me. i am hoping someone reads this forum who is sober and actually has quit, and wont get advice from a bunch of people high on dope, but alas.

So, I've been smoking for around 10 years now so i'm a bit experienced with smoking, ive also tried heroin before. i think i was given opium or heroin in my oil because the dude who sold it to me had a girlfriend and she told me it had opium. another person called me earlier today and said they tried that oil from someone else and they said it was the same and they said it had heroin in it. im kind of afraid of addiction and idk how long it would take to become addicted, i don't think i was impacted by my first experience with the drug but ive been smoking this oil kinda nonstop for like 2 weeks. what i want to ask is do you think thats enough time to become addicted? how long did it take you if you are addicted? and do you think it could be heroin/opium?, i can taste the hash and every time ive smoked hash i get a tingley in my nose and i get it with this stuff. the girl who said it was opium told me it was .5 lb of opium added to 4.5lb of hash. The girl who said heroin said it was under an ounce of hash and they were mad it was short so they added black tar heroin is what im assuming to it to make it an ounce or over. what do you think i should do i have less than a gram of it left, should i just smoke it or flush it?

Also what would you think it is? ill try to add pics from my phone, sadly its only an iphone nothing special like a real camera that can take a real picture but i guess it'll have to do

THe biggest problem is that there seems to be (from feel), at least SOME dope in it, but the only way I can draw right now is by continually pumping more water in (I mean 0.2 of the powder with 90 units water for a 35 water shot).

So far I don't think I have even been high, but my WDs did go away at least from several shots. I've been bamboozled, but is there any way to turn this 8-ball into some usable shots by getting around all the filler clogging the q-tips? Do I need a micron filter for this?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I just want to get high at least once from all this.

That's how bad this experience was. Basically I've been a casual opiate user for a couple of years now. It's somewhat of a habbit, but not something I go too far out of my way to do. That being said, I've done many opiates/opioids, including Suboxone, Methodone, Poppy Seeds, Oxys, Tylenol 3s, Trams, Opana, and most recently black tar. After smoking some with my friends, hours later when any noticeable effects had worn off I tried going to bed but had my first ever experience with sleep paralysis. As I began to fall asleep I noticed my muscles growing weaker and becoming increasingly more difficult to move. This was accompanied by a dreadful feeling of some sort of thing (for lack of a better term) in my room that was watching me. The scary part was I knew there was nothing there, I was completely lucid but I still felt some sort of presence. It was horrible. Luckily I snapped out of it but it kept happening. I even began to hear screaming at one point and that was enough to keep me from trying to fall asleep for the night. Overall it was one of the worst experiences of my life and I just wanted to know if anyone had similar experiences (my friend has on Methadone, but when he woke up, not while falling asleep) and if there were any tips for preventing this for future reference?",1388309080.0

Only took 2 or 3 a day, then dropped to two max, but taking halves a time.  I ran out a little over 24 hours ago.

I don't think it's too horrible right now, but I can feel it getting there and I'm a little scared/uneasy/uncomfortable. I'm mostly venting, I tend to keep to myself and none of my friends really know what's going on, so I have no one to share with or compare myself to.

I was doing some research online, found some stuff that said klonopin helps, so I'm having my script filled now.  (Had it for a while, been do for a refill)  I've also heard benedryl can assist.

that said, do you think seroquel would overpower that and help me sleep it off? i've heard people talk about trying other substances to counteract WDs and it backfiring on them, i did that with nyquil the first time i tried to kick and it was a disaster (if it's relevant, i was kicking H then, now i'm kicking morphine, both eating pills and shooting liquid). if i can wipe out or at least lessen this irrational fear of lying awake flailing around in my bed, i will have a considerably easier time with it this time around. shit's about to get real tonight by my estimate and i'm fucking dreading it because i'm a wimp.

This show is headed in a really fucked up direction.  And it's just brilliantly violent.  I used to watch snuff films almost every day, and there was shit in this show that made me cringe.

My Dr wouldn't write the script if I was too early, my insurance wouldn't fill the script if I'm too early, so who the hell are you saying you won't fill it early?

Recently came across four 5mg Morphine RDT (rapid dissolve tab?) tabs, which have no markings on them and come in individual rip-open pouches.

I have little-to-no tolerance to opiates, only using about 1lb PST on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of each week.  I have taken the past weekend off due to the holidays and whatnot.

From what I've read, eating/sniffing these morphine tabs will be a waste, is this true in anyone's experience?  I've also read that IVing pills is risky and I don't really want to go that route anyway.  I've read that plugging is the way to go, so I'm willing to try it this way (after much mental hyping).

Just wondering if anyone thinks that 15-20mg morphine up the butt is worth doing for a nearly opiate-naive person.

Also follow up question: would you combine benzos with this?  I have 1mg Xanax and several mgs of Ativan at my disposal.

follow-up edit: Way back when, about 15-20mg hydrocodone made me feel good and more recently I was kind of underwhelmed by ~180mg codeine.  Hope this info helps. Thanks!",1388248101.0

Second happened ten minutes ago doing the dishes.

Right now i have a fever of 102. Im sweating not stop, my muscles/body aches all over to where i can barely move, i cant stop coughing and clearing my nose. I havent had a cold this bad in probably 10 years, yet it has nothing on just the first few hours of being dope sick. For me(and a lot of others) the restlessness/insomnia of being dope sick is the real torture. The overwhelming feeling you cant sit still but it hurts to move. If youve never been through it you have no idea. I almost enjoy having a bad cold like this. Im not sure if its activating endorphins or something, but in a strange way almost reminds me of being on dope. Not sure what the point of this post was, just venting i guess.

Edit: on a side not i called out sick today. Wasnt even planning on scoring but had extra $50 and just said fuck it. Not only are the stamps i got fire, they are freaking huge. The first stamps ive gotten in years i would say are def .1 maybe more.",1388410414.0

I'd love to hear your stories on the subject as I know this has happened to many of you. Here's what happened to me tonight:

I was in major WD's a few minutes ago. Was expecting to be in a lot of discomfit until tomorrow when I got a call from my guy. He had promised to let me know in the off chance he got a hold of something and true to his word rang me up. 20 minutes later and I'm staring at a gram of ECP!

One problem though; I had no rigs and neither did my dealer. Sunday night at 11pm; fat chance of getting any that night either. 

Being a heavy IV user I never get high from snorting. luckily after rummaging around in my room I find an old syringe with a broken needle and decide to plug it.

The last time that I plugged H out of desperation I used .2 and felt NOTHING. This time I went for broke and did .75 lol. A horrible horrible waste that I don't condone but I just didn't care at that point.

Up it went.

To my surprise it hit me like a ton of bricks. I almost fell over walking from the bathroom to my bedroom, and those of who have plugged a lot probably know that if it hits you that fast your going to get really high.

Now I'm pleasantly nodding! Feels about equivalent to a quarter IV'd just without the initial euphoria of course. My wd's are totally gone and I think I'll get to actually sleep tonight!!

Gotta love it!

Is usually potentate my oxy as much as possible, tums/tonic water/Benadryl 20 mins before. Does tonic water work for intranasal H too? Any other potentaters?(besides general ones like booze/weed/benzos)

Another random quick question: why do they cut some H with fentanyl? I thought fentanyl was super strong and somewhat hard to come by.

She is very inexperienced with all drugs, and decided to experiment with H of all things.

Now, several weeks later, she is asking me and her BF to introduce her to dealers. Saying she will stop all contact with her family and BF to do more. Want get out of bed unless she knows someone has some H.

All this, and to her, she is still in control and its just a bit of fun.

Her BF and myself are trying to talk to her, but she went listen. All she cares about is who is scoring next.

She is a good less and we can't see her ruin her life through it.

How can we get through to her and make her realise that she is addicted and needs help. She is getting very aggressive, which is not like her.

We need to do something, and fast. But she just want listen.

I've successfully done it a few times before and know damn well that its no walk in the park. Regardless of how much you think that you are going to quit ""tomorrow"", once tomorrow comes, and the withdrawals kick in, quitting usually doesn't make much sense.  The problem is temptation and accessability.
 And hope. 
Once you lose all hope, its pretty simple to stop using, but in most cases, hope is just a phone call away to the dope man.  
Recently I've tried two times to quit, and around hour 36, somewhere between the overactive bladder and the bone chills, I cop out and call up the dope man. 

I've come up with a method for getting through the infamous first 72 hours, which is about how long it takes for my body to reach homeostasis: tomorrow I'm going camping two miles deep in the forest, which completely cuts off any chance I have of calling the dope man (shoot, I won't even have cell phone service out there).

WARNING: long post. i also get into some explicit stuff towards the end. i would really appreciate if an experienced opi(preferablly H) user helped me out here but all are welcome to read/comment obviously. all i ask is that if you judge me, please try to make it comedic. i could use a laugh or five. 

Long story short, been doing opis since i was 15 on and off(started with hydros from a minor surgery, then moved onto hydros/oxy prefered/other pharms, now mostly just oxy. been getting into H). never been addicted, i know everyone says this but ive never had w/d's, had times where i did opis for a week straight and then stopped cold turkey for months, had sporadic times where id use every couple days for a couple months and then stop for 6 months, etc

where i usually live i get tar. i prefer oxy due to the high/consistency but all thats been available lately is tar. i've gotten tar about 5x and smoked it all times. im not a fan of shooting, nothing personal/against it)

im currently staying in an area where all i can get is powder. im told its good by long time powder users(i think they're long time powder users, they'll probably see this post lol) and it seems good to me but i have nothing to compare it against

only thing is ive had some pain problems that ive never experienced before with any drug(besides some bad coke once) and i was wondering if some experienced users could grant some insight as to whats up.

the first time i copped i got half a bund and did it over the course of 3 days. that first night i did .1, second day i did .1 around 11am and then .1 at night maybe around 8pm, same for third. only negative affect i noticed was my nose was a little sore.slightly dried up. i figured this was normal due to a bunch of goddamn powder going through it.

next time i copped was maybe 6 days later, got 2 bundles, which lasted me 4 days(lol). honestly i dont remember the spread but i did a lot each day obviously, i sold 2 points. so 1.8gs(i'd say it actually turned out to be 1.5gs a couple of the bags were more like 0.04) over 4 days, spread out pretty evenly, except for today i only did .25. i figured this was a lot since my tolerance wasnt high(not a low tolerance but i'd say the oxy equiv would be 100mg oxy = great high with slight nod). the negative affects i noticed the end of the first day and have persisted until now(today,the last day, i did the last point 3 hours ago).

my nose is super dried up, inside and out. i figured this was just me being dumb and doing too much too quick. i keep lotioning it and hopefully it will go back to normal soon. its always been a lil dry on the outside but the inside is like a fucking desert. its also painful around the entrance to the nasal cavities/the middle part where it connects to right above your upper lip. wet and dry huge blood-boogers are plentiful. it feels as if i have a couple small pimples forming/formed at the entrance to my nasal cavities also

dry skin over all: i drink plenty of water, and even more whilst doing drugs. however, it seems this isnt enough. to be blunt, i havent shit in 3 days and my ass(they pretty area) is super super dry. 

heavy eyes. while not really painful or anything it is pretty damn annoying. they're just...there. also bags under my eyes. i just look strung out. i honestly dont care but shit im sure some people notice.

randomly blacking out: i cant tell if these are just mini nods or what. part of it may be due to lack of sleep but i think its 70% dope/30% lack of sleep(only been getting a couple hours of sleep each night). IE, ill be looking at my phone, read two texts, go reply, and then bam its a minute later with half a sentence written looking like this(yeah sure i can meet you down at the stewetekkkkkkrrrrrs= peter) and i dont remember explicitly falling asleep. or ill be watching a streamer on twitch, black/pass out, wake up and ill be facing the other way with the stream off. these are pretty sudden, not really gradual. EDIT: i fell asleep/woke back up four times while writing this. while very important, 

obviously being itchy is part of opiates but holy lord mother of god. its not so bad today but the other 3 days holy fuck i have never been so itchy in my life. i figured it was because of the high amount i did but i didnt know it was even possible to be this itchy. half of my body is somewhat raw and i have at least 6 scratches. 

lack of bloodflow/control to my nether regions: while i know its near impossible to masterbate while on opis, i found the middle two days i could only get fully erect for around 30 secods and after that i honestly could not get more than 5% hardness despite watching an incredible amount of quality porn

going off this: it was difficult for me to pee. i dont know how or why but i only went piss three times in the past 4 days. i felt like i had too, i felt it in there, but when i got to the toilet i just couldnt.

severe heartburn: enough said. i used to be on a bunch of meds for my back and they gave me an incredible amount of severe heartburn(so bad i was unable to eat) so they gave me ""the purple pill"" but on steroids. it worked well. i took it once a day for 3 weeks and after that i never needed it, even after continuing my hellspawn medication. however, this purple pill on steroids only combats this heartburn for a couple hours. we'll see if this heartburn goes away after tomorrow but as of right now it flares up while eating making it somewhat difficult to eat.

severe hiccups: fuck these things. with them come it seems to be small pumps of stomach acid that screech out with the force of a hundred suns. 

since this is already long as shit i'll just add more if i can think of/notice any

so, any H vet/doctor/knowledgable person please feel free to advise/help! appreciate it!

if i can give back in any way let me know!",1388463699.0

So I fall back on my other boy, who just isnt picking up at all.

So I take it to plan C at this point, which is try and cop off the street. I have done with before so I wasnt too worried. I'm out there (on foot), and I call to a boy standing on the porch of a house that I have been to before. He says he can help me, blah blah. I hand him a bit of cash and he takes a quick stroll with me in tow. 
Before long, things seem to be taking a long time and he seems to be trying get distant between us.
He joins a bunch of boys, a few of which look to be dealer types (nicer clothes, etc). They tell me to hop in a house with them really quickly.
As soon as I step in, I am followed closely in. Door closes and as I stand in the entrance area, I realize I am cornered.
My first boy comes up to me and simply says: ""You know what it is, empty the wallet.""
So I try to make a quick move for the door, but I am truly cornered. At which point two guys just shake my shit down, run through my pockets, all while yelling at me and pushing me around.
I get thrown over a barrier and a bigger guy starts tappin me with a baseball bat, just yelling like... ""Just give it up, it'll make it easier"" ""We taking everything""
SOMEHOW, they did not notice my car keys still in my front hoodie pocket underneath my jacket, even though I swore hands had been in there.
They toss me out of the building and I am back on the street, with nothings but my keys.
Luckily, I also left my debit car in my car, so I am not completely cleaned out.

Nonetheless, I drove home sick and am now wasting away in my misery.

I have not seen or heard from him in 30 Years,  and actually started to believe he was dead.

But he is not dead. Looking at his photo,  I know with 100% certainty he is my dad. 

I honestly have no idea how to handle this. I don't even know if I want to know him.  The person I considered my father died 3 years ago.  Now for some unknown reason,  my birth father has decided to contact me...  After 30 Year's.

If you're rich you're cured.  

If you're middle class you're cured ... provided you are willing to mortgage the house, go into massive debt and probably bankruptcy.

If you're poor you're fucked ( what else is new ).

Great part is as long as they keep the therapy out of most peoples hands they will have a steady stream of new customers.

Just wanted to make a user name for this subreddit.  I'm hoping my first post won't be too long.

I was very badly injured in Afghanistan in May '12.  Months in hospitals plus additional time in-patient physical rehab.  I played the VA game for over a year (any ex-military here will know the utter BS and bureaucracy of the VA), and finally got to where the doctors decided *for me* I wasn't in pain any more.

I moved away from my hometown to start over as they say.  I'm in a pretty small west coast town.  I'm single with no real family and on full-time disability.  I started hitting up doctors when I moved here, and initially got set up pretty good.  Lots of ""thank you for your service..."" doctors giving out pills like popcorn.  I was doing well but my tolerance was growing of course.  

I also have PTSD and depression and had to see a therapist here to get anti-anxiety and depression medicines.  Unfortunately after a few months my therapist got wind of my doctor-shopping and they have started to cut me back.  I know very soon I won't be getting pain medicine prescriptions anymore.

It pisses me off to no end because how would some doctor be able to decided for me that I wasn't hurting any more.  I cannot imagine not being able to take something for my chronic pain.  I wouldn't make it through a day.

Though I've tried a lot of other drugs, I've never tried H. I can't IV, but I'm seriously considering looking into H for pain control.  Can any one here provide a little insight on usage for pain management?  I'm alone and hardly know anyone so I know finding a local source is going to be a challenge.  Its around here but I know I'll have to play it safe.

It'd be great to hear any information people here could share.

TL;DR: Disabled & in chronic pain, doctors cutting off medicines, thinking about H for pain management, but not sure.

thanks

EDIT - Thanks so much for all the responses.  I want to take some time to reply to you guys so I'll be back in a bit.  

EDIT #2 - Oh man I am overwhelmed with the responses here.  This is much more than I expected. You all have given me a lot to think about and so much insight and that is very cool.  I want to reply to everyone which may take a little time.  Lots of people are asking about my injuries and my career and I can share more.  Thank you all again.  I hope everyone has a good New Years Eve.  I'll be popping oxys and hydros and playing Skyrim ha ha.

FINAL EDIT - Wow I can't even say thanks enough.  I've learned more in this one thread then all the googling I've done.  You all are a great group and I appreciate the time people here spent answering my questions.  I tried to add a lot of replies and included more details on myself.  I think I'll be sticking around this sub.  Everyone was really cool to share advice and experience.  Happy New Year.  Oorah!",1388427263.0
