I thought I'd done enough hair on so that the meth wouldn't do much, maybe add a little euphoria. Nope! The meth won out so I was up all night geeking and grinding my teeth. It was Hell. I hate geeking and worst of all I was out of hair-on. FF to noon today and I'm getting a ride to go hustle from the 1 roommate I have who is cool. I've asked my other 3 roommates who constantly try to take advantage of me to help me get well or find benzos as I'm sick and still geeking and didn't sleep at all. They all pretended they couldn't help even though I found out not long later they got dope without me. As we are riding my decent human being roommate says ""man I bet you feel rough. I bet you'd kill for a xanax"" to which I replied ""yes I would"". He hands me a blue football and I was sooo happy. There's nothing to drink so I throw It into the back of my throat and engulf it. ""Too bad it wasn't a whole bar worth"" He says. I reply with ""man at this point 1mg is a godsend."" He hands me another blue football with a shit eating grin showing he's thoroughly enjoying playing drug Santa. He's a good dude. I go to throw this half into the back of my throat and things go horribly awry and I throw the fucking thing over my shoulder. It goes somewhere in the back of the vehicle. Sleep deprivation, dehydration and meth made me fuck up tossing a pill in my mouth which I've done many thousands of times and never botched. Him being the cool chill mofo he is he says let's go to McDonald's and search for it. I start digging everywhere. Under my seat, under floor mats and down in the seats. The back seat is a bench like seat with a little hole thingy that holds the part the seatbelts plug into. I figure it's a long shot but I jam my sore track ridden hand down in there and begin digging. I immediately feel a pill and pull It out. Its blue hooray success! Wait, the little fucker is round. I tell my friend ""false alarm, it wasn't the football"" and hand him the pill I found without checking it. I return my hand to the hole and feel another pill and just as I'm hoping I've laid my fingers on my missing football I hear ""OMFG THIS IS A ROXI!!"". We had just pulled up to the order screen for the McDonald's drive through when he yelled this but no fucks were given. I pull my hand out the hole and yep I'm grasping another ROXI 30. I dig and dig and find 2 more ROXI but no more. We 're just blown away we now have 2 roxi 30s each. I bang mine and between that and the xanax I'd taken earlier kicking in I feel the evil grips of the malicious Tina relenquesh and I feel decent. Lucky for us he's the friend that drives all the druggies around and at some point in the last few months one of the several friends of his with roxi scripts got careless and dropped a few. I'm seriously wondering if there are more under the seat now but roxi will only help me if I'm sick since I do dope. Would be great to sell tho. I am eternally grateful to JJ, I really really needed the help then. I had a good day hustling and remember the other 3 roommates from earlier? They had got a point each earlier and I got a fat sack. 1.5G of fire and right this sec they're begging me for a crumb. Me and buddy who drove me had a wonderful day getting fucked up.

Being a young adult, I was so used to having my freedom and doing what I wanted so being stuck in the house was driving me insane. The day my parents decide to finally let me go out, (January 25 I believe), My mom finds my rig. None of my family members knew I used needles so it wasn't a fun day for me. I got my ass handed to me and now I'm back to square one. Can't leave the house AT ALL. I turned 20 recently and it's really sinking in. I'm not allowed to get a job. I'm stuck in my parents house, doing nothing, going nowhere in life. I mean, it's amazing to be clean for this long. I've only used about 3 times in the last 4 months. Now that I'm through withdrawal and I can actually piss clean, I just want to get a job and move forward in life but I can't without being homeless. I've got nowhere to go. My family cares about me so much and I care about them too. So how on earth do I go about escaping my parents without them feeling like I chose drugs over them? If I do anything they don't like, I'm out the door. It's all driving me completely nuts. The walls have been talking for a while.

So I've been in the dope game out here in the rocky mountains for a little over 8 years but oddly enough I have never had to cold cop in my life.  I've always just been fortunate enough to know or meet people at the right time and shit has just worked to where I could just get what I needed delivered...until this week. For a while I've had one ok d boy and one douche of a middle. Now my d boy was good on timing and price but his weight fluctuated. His 50 dollar half grams were anyone from .35 to .55 which sometimes sucked and sometimes rocked. But d boy got locked up on Tuesday and I know he's been deported before so he's fucked and now so was I. My middle has been stringing me along all week so fuck him. I felt like such shit today I had to take a sick day at work so there's a whole days pay gone.  I finally reach my breaking point said fuck it and decide to try my luck cold copping. I mean I've heard where the spots supposedly are downtown how hard can if be right? So I set out on my quest. Money in one pocket, knife in the other, and phone in hand wearing my dirtiest looking outfit. I spend 2 and a half hours crisscrossing the city on foot trying every spot I've ever heard mentioned.  Down this path, on that corner, under yonder bridge, in a couple parks and boy do I score. I find people selling weed, blow, crack, boomers, acid, meth, and Xanax. But of course no damn dope. FML. Now all that stuff I already know where to find it but I'm not one to waste an opportunity so I get some numbers and dejectedly start the long walk back to my car with just a couple xanis in my pocket to show for my trouble. When I am just a few blocks from my car and literally on the grass directly in front of the state capital I see a group of homeless who weren't there before. And what is sitting on the ground next to them? A beautiful roll of tin foil. My people! So I initiate a quick chat and offer to throw some cigs and cash to whoever can help me out and surprisingly the only black guy of the group hops up and says ""yeah my older brother can hook it up come with me."" Now the reason I'm surprised is cuz the Latinos usually have that shit locked down around here but hey whatever.  And sure enough the dude walks me over a couple blocks to meet his literally huge like 6 and half foot tall gangbanger brother and the deal is done.  Now here's the kicker the new d boy actually uses a scale.  What a concept right lol and for 50 bucks he threw me .6 which he says is always the price. Mission accomplished! Now was this hard work,  junky Jesus,  luck?  I don't know abs honestly I don't give a fuck. Not only did it work out but I've got a better hook than I used to have. So happy nods opi family! Life is good

TLDR: d boy got locked up. Had to cold cop for the first ever after 8 years of use.  Found some Xanax but no dope. Had given up when the universe finally rewarded me. Ended up with an even better hook than before.",1486794960.0

I cleaned up in the past years, but I still dabble in prescription opiates. Most people use opiates to escape their reality or make themselves feel better emotionally, at least in my case that is.
The effect that everyone is going for when using opiates is euphoria and opiates do achieve euphoria most of the time. However, there are times that opiates give you dysphoria or depression instead of euphoria. Does this happen to anyone else?


My ex girlfriend left me for another guy a couple of months ago. At first I was not hit by it at all, I just had a ""fuck it"" and careless attitude about it. Now I have been using morphine recently and the fact that I am single and my girlfriend leaving me for another guy is catching up to me.


I am a 25 year old guy and I am pretty masculine, but abusing opiates can make me feel very emotional. Lately when I have been high, I have been feeling very emotional, like a woman on her period (I know this is embarrassing to admit this). I have not been crying (I have an urge to unfortunately), but I have been feeling very depressed and just feeling very alone, like I am left in a dark room by myself. I think it is the morphine that is causing these feelings. Because I have had these feelings before when I use opiates.


I feel that opiates do cause feelings of dysphoria and depression sometimes. Does this happen to anyone else? Or do you get euphoric each and every time? I am really not taking this well with Valentines Day around the corner. I probably need to get off the Morphine because I do not feel like this when I am not high on opiates :(",1486792562.0

But let me just give you a bit of a teaser, and if I get some good stories I will expand further more on some of the things I have done with cops.
Now this is going back well over 20 years ago. At the time one of my best friends was a member of the Vice Narcotics Squad in major city with a lot of drugs. We became friends through another mutual friend and started hanging together and going to a lot of bars and drinking. He was a few years older but we were both in our 20's. We did a lot of drinking together and just raising hell like any normal 20 somethings would do out at clubs. But when you party with the cops a lot of rules don't apply to you. There were some bars in the area that we're known as ""cop bars"" and would basically comp out bartabs or seriously discount them. I wasn't a cop nor am I a cop, the felonies on my record prevent that from ever happening that.
I don't even know where to start because there are too many good stories. We both used to like to do cocaine and with him being a narcotics detective there was an endless supply of it and this was stuff that came from the top, like right off the kilos. When you have access to that much coke things can get pretty crazy especially when you have a badge and a gun.
So this cop,l I will call Tom to protect the innocent. Anyway, Tom was a good cop and he did undercover work. He was never a patrolman and never wore a uniform. He just looked like a regular dude you would see hanging at the bar. Tom wasn't the type of cop to bust someone for smoking a joint at a party, or he wasn't the type of cop to even make an arrest when he was off duty. To him it was just a job. In fact he wasn't worried about the guy selling a few dime bags or a few grams of coke. He went after the guys that were selling multi-kilos of heroin and coke. But more importantly he was a cool dude and he was my friend.
So I guess i will start off one of the stories by telling you about the first time i found out he used drugs. I always was facinated by his job and always asked questions about what if tey made him try it or what if they thought he was a cop but he always had some bullshit answer and he didn't really like to talk about work. So this one night we were out drinking and we came back to my house because some girls were going to meet us there. I remember standing in my kitchen and he says to me.....""hey, you want to do some lines before they get here'.....I was like sure, whatever dude. Because at this point I had no Idea he ever used this stuff or even tried it. I wasn't really paying attention to what he was doing but i turn around and sure enough he was chopping out some FAT RAILS....I nearly fell out at this point and grabbed the bag he had. This was a sandwich bag filled with about a half ounce rock that was shimmery and shiny like a diamond. This was the early 90's when cocaine was real fishscale. So he rolls a bill up and hands it over and I don't hesitate to inhale the quater gram rail he just laid out. I hand the bill over to him expecting him to be like.....haha, I'm not doing that shit. But sure enough he whiffs it up and I could tell it wasn't his first time either.
So as the night goes on we continue our binge, and the girls never show up but that's fine because we have a huge back of blow. We had back out to the bars and stay out until the sun comes up the next morning.

So I have plenty of other stories I would like to tell if you are interested in hearing them. Things like the time we were out bar hoping and someone offers us some drugs. Tom says lets see what you have but come in this alley because you never know where the cops are. we dip in an alley and Tom pulls out his badge along with his 9mm and puts it to the dealers head, tells him he is under arrest as I go through his pockets and get all his goodies. Then Tom tells the dealer that he has 10 second head start to run to make his get away because it's his lucky day.
Or the stories of having so much FREE COKE that gram size rocks are just spilling out and we don't even care because there is so much more where that came from.
Anyway, if anyone has some similar stories I would love to hear them. Most of you guys will probably think I am making this up and that's fine, I don't really care if you believe me or not. this shit happened and it was a long time ago. I'm not really too comfortable talking about it but who cares.",1486769872.0

I'm in GA and the south is supposedly flooded with pharms. I used to be able to get dilaudid, roxies, percs, etc. pretty much any pharm opiate I wanted without much trouble.
The problem with a small town/suburb is that you have to get lucky with who you know. there is no cold-copping here. once you get out of that scene, it can be kind of hard to get back in and find new people. Everyone I used to know is either clean, locked up, or moved away. I keep trying to find people near me with scripts but it's borderline impossible.

and forget about boy- you just have to get really lucky. I know that heroin is an epidemic in suburban communities, but it isn't flooding the streets like it's portrayed. it's still kept under the radar and it isn't something you can just ask around for. I knew one guy in my area who sold really quality dope for $20/point, but he got locked up within a couple of months. All the other dope around here you have to drive a distance to get, and it's almost always cut with fent or is just plain shitty.

maybe I don't know the right people, since I've heard of people in the southeast getting roxies opanas and dope like it's nothing. maybe it's a good thing, since the only reason I've been clean so long is because I cut myself away from that whole scene.

I was about five and my mom and father would have fights about dumb shit all the time like for a example my dad tried to teach my mom how to cook pasta because every time she cooked the pasta noodles would be hard and really soft in some places and my mom felt like my dad was making her feel dumb so she stabbed him in the cheek with a screw driver and my dad didnt even lay a hand on her (witch was surprising i would've strangled a woman if she did that type of shit).

  My 3 older brothers had it worst then me though, she would beat their knuckles with her knuckles, we had CPS come to our house 4 times, my mom even left her kids in the corner for hours apon hours and even tried to distance one of her kids named anthony from her own family because she felt that my dad was ""brain washing him"" but even worse then that she left  her family for the literal definition of a man child and a bum just because my dad would try correct her and she couldnt handle being wrong and it makes sense because the new boyfriend she had the type arguments that went exactly like this ""no your wrong, no Your wrong!"".

 my dad finally kicked her out of the house so she can live in her boyfriends truck and i cant imagine how hard it was for my dad to take care of 3 teens and a 6 year old and pay for damages of the already broken home.

 My dad got pretty obese from the stress from past history and the present future, he started gaining a 100 pounds every few months and eventually got fired/quit his job because of the weight and other health issues. 
Then one day my brother james tried to flick a cigarette into the trash can in his room and ended up lighting his whole room on fire. I was the only one that was awake surprisingly, so i wake up my dad and he went up stairs with a pitcher of water and by the time he took 2 steps up the stairs leading to my brothers rooms he knew the house was fucked, so he ran up the steps anyway and woke every one up and got every one out. 

Since we didn't have a house anymore we got my aunt to drive us down to florida and got our own house, my other 2 brothers got their places after year of living with their dad and ended up living with their girl friends.

 Me, my 3 brothers and my dad lived together and my dad payed for every thing with the government money we got once a month, witch as you expect wasn't alot for 4 adults and a kid.

 All my brothers had the hired and fired type of employment history after a while my dad weighed nearly 500 pounds and we was struggling with food every 2 weeks out the month and i barely had clothes so i was wearing the same clothes 3 days out of the week.

 It really didnt feel that bad at the time but thinking about it now shit was crazy, like my 2 holidays was the 3rd and my birthday, I remember being woken up at 2am every 3rd and driving with my dad to go to the McDonalds to get like 30 burgers and hit the store when they opened and just eat like crazy, So that was the monthly event. 

Some times (4 times to be exact) my mom would visit me in florida and sleep over because idk why my dad let her in, but she would stay for like a week or 2 and when she would leave she would just leave a note that i couldnt read at the time, she left without saying a word 4 times.

 When i started getting alil older like 11 i was the most shittiest kid imaginable like i was fighting every day in school, like fighting the first day off of suspension and getting suspended again, just alot of unneeded stress for my dad and the worst shit i did was hide(melt in the seat) when my dad drove me to school so my friends wouldnt see me because i was embarrassed of my dads obesity and i seen that hurt him really bad because i would hear him cry while he sits in his wheel chair in the living room at night while he thinks everyone is asleep and i didnt even realize that it hurt him like that, im honestly crying as i type this because i cant imagine being in his shoes going through all of that, even though that we was poor he would still get me the toys i always wanted just to make me happy.

 Fast forward to December its a few days past my birthday and my dad caught a cold from my brother james and started to get slowly worse and worse and one day he forgot to put his air mask on and he woke up hallucinating from the lack of oxygen to his brain (there is a word for this type of thing. But its too big to remember, it usually happens with fighter pilots that fly in low oxygen environments) 

so me and my brother james hear my dad yelling this ""james A*** please head to the front office for consoling"" like he was the principle to school and it made my high ass brother laugh his ass off and i go into the room where my dad was and he was just chillin on his bed staring at me (he only had COPD meds so he couldnt of had an overdose from pills),  i yell to my brother to call the cops but he refused at first because he was high as hell and didnt want to talk to the cops but after i told him that dad might die he called the cops and my dad was brought to the hospital and about a week later my dad was on life support.

 My brother anthony came back from maryland to florida and took me to live with him because james didnt seem like the taking care of kids type but before i went to my new home with my brother anthony, he took me to the hospital where my brother would pull the plug on my dad but my brother asked me if i wanted  my last words.

 I replied yes, i held my dads hand and said i love you and he ant say nun back, after that visit i got in the car and went to baltimore mayland to live with at my brother girlfriends house for like a year or 2 and i was still fighting every day and started to smoke weed and had my first gf slap the hell out of me when i was 13 for fingering her best friend at a sleep over that gf was attending at.

 my brother ended up kicking me out because his gf didnt like me and he couldnt do anything because it wasnt his house and he had his baby to watch after. He ends up telling me that i have to live with my dreaded mother. 

So my brother drove me to Delaware to meet my mom at a hotel so my brother can drop me off, funny thing is that he hugged me good bye but when my mom gave him a hug he kept his hands behind his back.

 So i just chilled there till my brother sent over some papers so my mom would be able to get survivor benefits from my dad dieing it was 1500 a month and that sounds like alot for 3 people but it was really 200$ a month because her boyfriend (witch has a job and makes $700 a week)  didnt pay for anything. So my mom was paying electric, all the bills and food and the bank was putting her in the negatives and he just leached off of her for so many years i always reminisce about beating his ass. 

When we would be struggling with food he would lock food that he bought for himself  in his car and eat like 3 things then let the rest rot, so hopefully you get the point that hes a bum lol.

 When my mom/her bf didnt like the landlord for dumb reasons like my mom would not pay the full price for rent because she never had enough money for it. So dumb reasons like that made me live mostly all over the east coast as a teen and been in mostly every hood but the time i was in philly was the shittiest because my mom and he bf did the most grimy shit like for example one of my homeless friends caught her and her bf eating a burger at a checkers while i was at home with no food but most the Crazy things that happend in philly i already posted about a while ago so il save you the reading.

 Things were like that for the whole time i lived with my mom and in that time of living with my mom i started doing most the hard drugs like k2, oxy, pcp, adderall. almost a year of smoking k2 at 15/16 i was throwing up blood and pissing the color of coffee. 

I gatta clarify that my drug use wasnt all because of my parents and life entirely but i just like feeling high and good, good is a feeling that havent felt in a while.

I hope you enjoyed the story i really thought about not posting this because i dont really use alot of opiates in this story but i dont wanna feel out of place on other subs because not alot of people on other subs like druggies but a great gal convinced me to post this because we are a family!",1486768688.0

Sitting in nod on my couch all day sounds awful.   

Rather than using opiates being the end goal, perhaps it will be more beneficial to use opis a boost or an accelerator to other goals.  Don't let drugs be your ambition and sole reason you live your life.  Use them responsibly and in a way so that your usage allows you to reach your ultimate destination or accomplish what you need to do (finish your degree, sign that deal, complete the project, etc.).  

The whole ""Junky gunna Junk"" mentality is lazy, detrimental to society, and gives the rest of us opiate users who aren't ""junkies"" a bad name.

It was green and had an ""OX 80"" imprint on one side, the other one was blank. Here is a link to some pictures of the pill: http://imgur.com/a/bahtr

I proceeded to quarter the pill and, crush one of the pieces and then snort it. The inside was white and easily crushable.

Please note, that I didn't have any opioid tolerance when snorting it.
After 10 minutes, I felt a little bit of warmth and a general sense of well being. It was barely noticeable, though. I waited for a little while and then proceeded to snort another quarter. I didn't feel any increase in effects. I waited again, crushed the third and last piece and snorted them. Now I had a hard time keeping my eyes open, but it wasn't like a nod.

That was 12 full hours ago and hasn't changed yet. I feel slightly uncomfortable and my eyes are extremely heavy. Basically, it's the same as right after snorting the pill.

I was planning on getting em after work around 330, and having to drive 45 to my dudes house, not the end of the world, but not how I wanted to spend my Friday afternoon after a long hard week at work.
Well my plug calls me about noon, and says he's in the area, and he can deliver. Said he'd be here in an hour....and I shit you not he was early by 5 min! Blew my mind

I work in a stuffy ass engineering unit for a major auto manufacturer, huge tech center, over 10000 employees here. Needless to say, similar to corporate prison, lol, though I love my job! 

The facility is huge and literally has hundreds of bathrooms, so I copped, popped 3 thirties and walked to a nice private restroom and chopped up another 45 mg, right up the ole beak, walked out feeling like a million bucks! 

Out of here at 3, so two more blissful hours to go. Grabbed a bunch too, so I get to surprise my lady with em too when I get home!

In fact I had some bags from a different and I poured them next to each other and they look identical. Usually if it's bad cut you can tell by the looks. Either it's grainy or it's a different color. But this stuff is powdery just like regular dope. The guy I get it from is a regular connect and wouldn't burn me. In fact he said he would buy it back. he said that some other people complained it burned.

My Federal refund was just over $1,500.  My State refund (MD) was around $250.  I filed my return Friday 2/3/17 later in the afternoon (maybe like 3:30 PM*ish*).  So that was only one week ago (technically less than a week, since I got my money in the AM.

___

**READ THIS PARAGRAPH!!**  If nothing else, read this paragraph, because ...*drumroll*...  I got my refund today!!  Well, actually, I got my State Refund yesterday (a **6-day** turnaround from the time I filed) AND I got my Federal Return today (a **7-day** turnaround from the time I filed).

___

**State Tidbits:**  As I said, I filed this past Friday afternoon, one week ago.  The State (MD), on the tax refund tracker, it had said that it was approved on Tuesday 2/7/17, and the money was sent that same day; I'm thinking, WOW that's fast.  Now, it did say that the direct deposit could take 48 hours for the funds to hit my bank.  In my mind, I'm thinking, since everything was electronic, it'll be in there by the next day at the latest.  Unfortunately, that did NOT work out... HOWEVER, the bottom line is that my State refund only took 6 days which is fucking tight.

**Federal Tidbits:**  According to the IRS' tax refund status tracker, it said that my return was ""APPROVED"" on Wednesday 2/8/17.  The money had NOT been sent at that point, but it said on the status tracker that it should be sent by Friday 2/10/17, and if the funds haven't hit your bank by 2/15/17 to then call your bank... because some shit is fucked up.  Anyhow, I check the tracker this morning (after 9:00AM EST), and nothing had changed, it still said that the funds were supposed to be sent on 2/10/17 (today) but the tracker had **not** reached the third level which says that the funds have been sent.  At this point, I'm thinking, fuck me; with the weekend coming up, I'm probably not seeing that IRS refund until Monday AT THE EARLIEST... Well, well, well... I decide to just check my online bank account balance because 'why not'... stranger things have happened.  SURE ENOUGH, baby!!... that refund was sitting in there lookin at me all pretty n shit!!

**TLDR:**  I filed my return this past Friday, and got my State refund yesterday (it only took 6 days), and got my Federal refund yesterday (7 days)!  FUCK YES!!

I just wanted to ask if anyone remembers the wild wild west days of internet pharmacies? When I say pharmacy I am saying that there were sites that you could order Hydrocodone products like vicodin and lortab and also benzos like xanax. I am going back to about 2002 or 2003. There was a period of a year or so where there were semi-legit websites where all you had to do was fill out a questionnaire and submit it. The people running the web-site would have a real doctor look it over and write a real prescription and the web site would fill it. You could get about 90 pills for about $100 i think and it came in a real pill bottle with a real label. and you could order from multiple web sites. There were even some web sites that would require you to submit your real medical records. Also, some sites you would submit your information and they would then have you go visit a Dr near you that the website would pick. I never did the Dr visit thing but there was a period of about 6 months where I was ordering vicoden regularly off the internet. I think back then hydrocodone was a schedule III or IV so there was some legal loophole where all of it was semi-legal. Then the news started doing stories on how there were these off-shore pharmacies filling millions of pills a month and the whole thing stopped. It was a real shady business and I would get phone calls from people claiming to be with such and such pharmacies and they could fill any script over the phone and this went on for a few months. Now you still see online pharmacies claiming to sell these types of medications but you know that are all bullshit and as soon as you give them your credit card info it is sold to someone in Russia.

No loans or mortgages but that's because my credit's gone sour and paying those haven't been high on the list. My alienation started when i was just a teenager so i have no practical skills whatsoever in there.

The code of conduct and morals couldn't be simpler. The normal world is just court cases and whatnot bullshit, weasel business imo. It's awfully difficult with bureaucracy.

Hell, even talking to normal people is really hard. They talk about work, their kids, things that i have no part in. I could talk about drugs, using said drugs, or what's happened because the drugs. Telling them about person who went to jail two years ago and week ago, when he was released, he went to where the snitch lives and knifed him. They'd look me in horror. But that's just normal.

IV Heroin user have debates FOR EVER about weather it' s better to use more water or less in your spoon.  
While I've tried to find any actual evidence in research papers about delivery efficiency and absorption depending on potency of solution, I've never found any peer reviewed works specifically for IV heroin and more specifically No.4 or 'china white' (basically we are not talking about black tar heroin here) 
 
So as there is NOTHING to say larger amounts or smaller amounts of water get you more high (believe me ive looked) 
2 common word of mouth concurrences are: 
1. smaller amounts will hit you quicker, peak higher and finisher earlier.  
2. larger amounts will hit you slower, peak lower and finsh later. 
NONE of that has been proven, and while the majority of users agree with those 2 suggestion, some users SWEAR the opposite, but none of it is immune to confirmation bias which, i believe is responsible for those opinions. so take it with a grain of H.  
 BUT HERE""S THE REAL ANSWER:  
You should use LARGER amounts of water in your spoon, here's why. 
1. loss. Say you mix half a G in 4units of water, if you bump your spoon or something and 2units goes on the dirt, you have lost a quarter  gram, but if you mixed in with more water say 10units and then bump 2units over the edge of the spoon to the dirt, you have lost only one tenth of a gram.  Simple, spread you stuff though more water and you will lose less for each drop spilled.  
 2. Risk of OD.  ok, so you know your dealer?, and you know your amounts?, and you know you tolerances right?  WRONG answering yes to those three questions will get you klled. The end, i dont want to hear any 'but' debates on this.  
 So a couple techniques can help, obviously using more water makes your stuff less potents and you lessen the chance of a 'surprise' OD, but as you push the plunger in its good practice to stop half way for a moment, you wait a breath until you feel your stuff hitting you, Does it feel like it normally does? (same stuff as usual) Is it coming on faster'slower than usual? (the heroin maybe stronger/weaker) Are you getting any strange tingles in your arm?(missed shot) burning feeling?(hit an artery /bad cut/dirty tools) tightness of breath/lungs?  eyesight fading? (bad stuff) going stupid sleepy? (bad stuff/ cut with sleepers)  - Now these are just precautions, DO NOT take these symptoms as fact, i'm no doctor just a 30+year IV user. but you can see what taking just a moments pause maybe preventing. If something DOES feel super strange or you high is coming on 100 times faster, DONT push the rest in. believe me i know its tempting, you dont have to pull it out right away, just give it another moment or two ok. if shit is still weird then stop.  
 3. You lose less on the INSIDE when you use more water too.  If you poke THROUGH a vein (not ONTO but THROUGH) ie. it sticks out of the other side and your just squirting water/H in to your muscle, then the less potent the mix the less you lose un till you fis it by re-insertion .  
now this is the part of IV use 90% of user fuck up: YOU LOOSEN THE TOURNIQUET BEFORE YOU PRESS THE PLUNGER!  
Yes, BEFORE (if you read and proper IV user guide carefully you will say it says before) (dont show me other say to loosen it after, i know some say that)  But the idea of a tourniquet is to make the vein 'present' for easier inserting of the syringe. You notice how a syringe tip is cut at an angle? well the 'hole' should face up, away from your arm and pointing to your heart, the lower the angle of insertion the better.  Say your arm is flat on a table with the crock of the elbow facing up. The the needle should be pointing towards you and as low as an angle you can get to get in you vein (its harder to poke right THROUGH a vein this way) with the hole facing up (less likely to lose solution when it in your vein) once you are in the vein (old schoolers will get to know this by feel, yes really) you draw back the plunger just a bit to check for blood in the needle (this is could 'registering) and it my favourite party of the process, when i see that 'red ribbon of bliss' float and curl its way into that tube then i know my moment of beautiful flight, or my total relief from hellish pain is now only the push of a button away.  
 .. sorry, got carried away then.  
OK so once you registered successfully (seen blood, needle in place) NOW you release the tourniquet, you dont want pressure on your veins by leaving the tourniquet tight when your injecting, this can force some of the solution OUT of you veins (kind of obvious when you think about it) 
If you have done the insertion correctly, there is no need for the tourniquet on as you push the lunger. (remember, its just to present the veins for insertion/registering)  note. the above guide asumes you are injecting in your elbow crook.   
  . . . and TAHT ladies and gents is my:  
 'Why more water is better and Smarter/Safer injecting guide""   
 TL:DR
 Use more water because it's safer and you lose less when you spill it

It is now 5:23 AM eastern time. 

 I go to college in PA.  This is all so irrelevant, but the 4 mg alprazolam (xanax) which I have been taking throughout the day for the same period of time is a combo made in heaven.  

I have been a lifetime lurker, I literally have never posted anything on reddit in my life.  

This shows the synergy between the two drugs.  Dexmethlyphenidate and Xanax have given me some of the most enjoyable nights of my college career.  

Now on to my more nefarious vice: the almighty bean.  We call 30mg roxicodone ""beans"" or quite often, ""jawns"".  I used to rip them with my one friend who I'll henceforth refer to as ""P"".  P had a connect at school in Rhode Island who happened to live close to us.  At first, I would only cop through P and not his connect.  Once I got P's connect, the frequency at which I copped increased exponentially.  

 This was my summer going in to my junior year of college.  I had an internship, so most of my days that summer were consumed by the 9-5 lifestyle.  Once I got home, I would hit up P's connect, henceforth to be known as R.  One profound memory I have of those times was when I would be driving to R to cop, who lives a few miles up the highway.  The contrast between being in NYC and whipping down the NJ highway to score blues literally 45 minutes later (the length of my commute) really started to make me feel like an absolute fiend.

Wow sorry for bombarding you guys with minutiae, I swear I'll get to the point. 

Long story short, I kept doing blues throughout the summer and into my junior year of college.  Junior year wasn't bad, I would pop perc 10s and of course rip 30s whenever I had the chance, but I didn't get withdrawals at that point.  That was the one rationalization I have made which may be a turning point in my life.  I am a master at rationalization, that's why I've been doing opiates at least 6 times a week for the past 4 months.  

If you guys care to critique my life choices, feel free---but actually this is the opiate subreddit so you guys will be pretty understanding- damn now I finally understand why so many people take their time to write anonymously on reddit.  Judgement free zone, hard to find these days.  JESUS this combo makes me ramble even when I try my absolute hardest to be succinct. 

MY semi-MAIN QUESTION-

What's the best way to smoke roxys.  Back story:  I was strictly snorting them for about a year and then my boy showed me how to slide one on tin foil and get massive hits. Not only were we getting high, we were also fostering a camaraderie, because even though we are just doing drugs together, me and my smoking buddy, henceforth to be referred to as WM, had some unforgettable times roasting and bumping tunes cruising around campus.  We call the process of smoking a roxy ""roasting"".

My ORIGINAL purpose in writing something on reddit for the first time was to dispel the myth that smoking oxy is stupid/ineffective.
Yes, the bioavailability is signficantly lower.  But the ritual, the ritual of getting the necessary materials (foil, lighter, blue), taking massive rips as that bad boy slides down the foil, and generally just kicking it as you get rocked is a great facilitator of camaraderie.   

TLDR:  Smoking roxy is not dumb, it gets you and your boys rocked and maybe you can even make a friend by showing someone how to roast a bean properly, trust me WM will be my boy forever.  And it all started with one little roast, ah the tangled webs we weave.

So if anyone disagrees with me and thinks smoking blues is dumb I'll be up all night, or morning, because its actually now 6:15 am. 

WELP I gotta finish the remnants I have in my handy dandy foil.  Happy smoking folks- and figure out a way to quit or you'll fuck up the trajectory of your life, whether thats your academic trajectory or your spiritual trajectory.  

ONE LAST THING: my girlfriend just broke up with me so send me that reddit gold shit so i can get enough money to cancel our valentines dinner and take a different girl.  Is that reddit gold stuff real cash?  Please answer that if you can, its pretty important.  I think I could make a living out of interacting with intellectuals and drug addicts alike.  

If anyone gives me a thoughtful response to my absolute incessant rambling, I would appreciate it.  I honestly couldn't tell you if I made a point in what I wrote in the paragraphs above because when I write I write things once and then I don't look at it again.  Proofreading is for those with a weak understanding of the English Language.

Anytime I'm nice and high (as in, feeling VERY good, but nothing TOO extreme) and I smoke a cigarette, I get an overwhelming need to throw up.

Now, there are times when I'm able to stand over my bathroom counter and spit out the saliva that's formed from my ""mouth sweats"" I get. While also, carefully, burping a bit here and there, to alleviate the pressure. After about 8-10 minutes the feeling has passed and I'm golden. 

Other times there's absolutely nothing I can do to stop it and I'm taken Vom City. Luckily I'm almost always able to keep it at bay until I make it to a suitable place to unleash it. 

I've found that the chances of me actually spewing rise pretty greatly if I've eaten anything within the last 30-45 minutes, which I'm sure has a lot to do with having a full stomach. Which really fucking BLOWS as I love to smoke after eating just like every other smoker in the world. 

So does this happen to ANYbody else?! Or does this cheese stand alone? Trust me, if it doesn't happen to you, give an extra thanks to the God of your choice because it f-in sucks grundle ending the night blowing chunks when you're feeling good.

5tkele,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5tkele/to_ujurassicvibes_the_kid_who_thinks_he_is/,99,https://redd.it/5tkele,VariableBlunt,"To u/JurassicVibes, the kid who thinks he is strong-willed enough to try Oxy and never, ever in their life get hooked.","No one is telling you that you're going to wake up the day after you take them and think to yourself ""I need to do whatever I can to buy more oxy and nothing else in life matters now."" That's not how it works. Chances are, as long as you take enough to have the full opiate-virgin experience and get this easily obtained euphoria, you'll have a nice, deep sleep and the next morning you'll wake up with a bit of an ""afterglow,"" similar to MDMA, but with an opiate feel. You'll be fine then. The issue is that you will remember the feeling and you might even think, ""huh this was nice experience and I had fun, but i don't get why everyone on reddit was freaking out, this isn't really such a hardcore drug and is pretty subtle"" (like you have mentioned somewhat expecting.)

You'll go on with your life and continue with your so-called amazing self-control. You'll continue setting your monthly targets and goals, will achieve them, and will use some oxy as a reward every month or two. Again, this would not be a problem on paper. You'll be fine, as you say, you're continuing to avoid using more than you said you would and you haven't upped your dose, at all. You'll be ok.

The problem with this train of thought is that, the more you use them, the more your brain will link target goals -> working on them -> reward. This is how reward pathways start. Your brain will remember the good feeling achieved from the Oxy & you will have no guilt about it. ""It's really not such a scary drug like those guys from reddit kept saying""

This routine continues for say, a year. You stay on target & you dont stray from your dose or your schedule. Again, the routine is going to continue reinforcing pathways in your head, and the oxy will make it a much stronger and direct connection. Maybe one month you meet an extra goal and do it every two weeks. You do this again maybe 2 months later and take it twice again, only now you are starting to notice a dip in the amount of euphoria you are getting, BUT you aren't gonna up your dose because you're strong-willed, so you take some potenators and get way higher than you have been. You take the potenators everytime you dose now cause it was so nice.

THEN something in life happens that sucks really hard., like getting dumped by your longtime partner, you lose a great job you worked hard your whole academic life on getting, your mother dies from cancer suddenly, ANYTHING really shitty that you can think of. You admit to having anxiety and depression so you are familiar with getting in a depressed slump/rut, i'm sure. Now, after all that longtime planning and careful dosing of these opiates (that you haven't truly been respecting because you think you are stronger-willed than everyone else, remember) you decide to get some a week after you had last dosed. This new dose lifts you out of your headspace, but just temporarily. You go back to being down.

See where this can lead?? This is where the real danger in using opiates regularly lies (and yes using one every month or two months is regular). No matter how careful and ""strong-willed"" you may have be, you can't account for life throwing you a shit roll. You have already created these direct paths in your brain that lead to not just euphoria, but contentment, a lack of depression & anxiety, FEELING GOOD. It really isn't hard to justify further use with these drugs, ESPECIALLY when you use them as a reward. You will use again. And again. And again. It continues and continues.

But by all means, use them and think that you are in the extreme minority of people that won't get hooked on the feeling because you've used pretty much all other classes of recreational drugs before (just like 95% of us on here). The best thing that can happen to you when you try it is that you wont really like the feeling of being on an opiate.

Good luck, and please respect (and even fear) these drugs and where they can lead.",1486887390.0

So I drive 30 mins in opposite direction to pick up my friend then 40 mins into the city. The supplier which is a friend of this kids dad insists we come in for a game of ping pong. That shit turned into 3 games. Still did not have the meth in my hand . I wanted to be the one to divide it up. The kid who gave me the $100 would get half and me and me and my friend would split the other half. 

Then my friend has  this brilliant idea of picking up left over road salt from the snow storm and using it to cut the kids bag. I didn't like the idea but at that point I'm like fine . So after an hour we finally leave the suppliers w/house meth in hand (his) smh 

Now the supplier needed a ride . It was on the way so I was like ok fine whatever but the whole time my boy is all pissed off bc no matter how much he begs this dude will not give him a front . I'm sitting there like give me the fuckin sack so I can split it up before we get to this kids place.  so he hands it to me. I put all the road salt in one bag and was pulling meth out of the other bag to mix in. My idiot friend is sitting there the whole time yelling and critiquing me (mind u I'm parked and starting to drive ) so finally I was done I'm like ok u jerk off if u don't like the way I did it then u do it. I hand him the bag and specifically tell him which bag is the mix and which is just the meth . Well wouldnt u know this idiot mixed the bags up and gave my friend who paid the  pure one and we got the rock salt meth mix .

I have some OP 20s, but I am under the impression that control released oxy doesnt have much recreational value, since the 20mg dose is spread out over 12 hours. I really like the idea of getting a decent buzz that lasts that long though... so keeping in mind that my typical dose for instant release is like 30-40ish mgs, if I were to take like 3 of the OP 20s would I get a decent buzz? I imagine 60mg wouldn't be too much of a risk for a serious OD, especially not being released all at once. Or would I have to take even more? 

Basically, if there's a way to take enough of these to be recreationally viable, how much can I safely take (I have done a lot of opiates so I have a moderate tolerance) and based on my typical dose stated above how much SHOULD I take?

Finally, if what I'm afraid of is true and there's just no way to get the effects I want with XR oxycodone, is it possible to break the current OP 20s in half or something to counter act the delayed release? And if so, does it work pretty reliably?

My parents got wind of it finally and I was off to rehab. The hell of detox is something I can't describe, but I'm sure a lot of you know what I'm talking about. I was just a fucking kid still and I had to go through that.

So then I was a young adult fresh out of rehab. I made up my mind to never take a drug again. If I suffered an injury, I'd rather feel every second of that pain that have to detox again.

I was already a little of an outcast. I'm a goofy looking skeleton of a guy. I'm also an introvert. Because of that I was picked on mercilessly in high school. I was beaten up and verbally tormented. I had a few friends I had met through being a musician. They started inviting me to parties.

They knew I was sober and that I was just at the parties to socialize. It was all good. They have been my friends for years now.

Now cut to 4th of July 2015. I was at one of these parties with my buddy and some asshole from high school was there. He was pressuring me to drink and drug all night. He played it off like he was just busting my balls, but he knew he was torturing me just like he used to do in school.

That night that fucking piece of shit put heroin into my system while I slept. I woke up tripping. That was fucking it. The end of my life.

The mother fucker is still doing time for what he did, which is the only happy part of this story.

Anyway I'm fucking deeper in to heroin that anything in my life. Nothing fucking matters anymore. Family, friends, girlfriends, music, whatever. Fuck it all because this shit is my life.

I'm on 10 bags a day and I do whatever the fuck I have to do to get my shit. That number is only going to go up until I'm dead.

I guess the reason I'm posting this is to reach out to people who are curious about trying this shit. It's not fucking worth it. I'm dying for you. I never got to make the choice to do drugs. That fucking choice was made for me and I am going to fucking die for it. Let me die for you. Don't fucking try it.

I'm not going to preach to anybody who already does it. To  each his own. But if you never tried it, don't start. Please

Part of me feels like this is the last coherent shit I'll ever do with my life. I'm literally about head out to get some shit right now.

I didn't pick this shit for my life. Please don't pick it for you either",1486850495.0

So, I've been using heroin daily for 3-4 months now. I have no previous experience with opiates outside of this time frame, but I have been a drug user for over a decade and have been to rehab once for alcohol/cocaine use.

I'm definitely still in the honeymoon phase of my addiction - there haven't really been any negative consequences to my use thus far. I'm very aware that things will not remain this way though, and I was wondering how long it took for opiate addiction to start to negatively impact some of your lives? 

Clearly it's going to be different for everyone and dependent on a wide array of factors, but I'm just trying to get a general idea. I insufflate, btw.

I almost feel like I was doomed from the start. Part of me wants to be clean so badly, but another part of me just loves being high too much. It doesn't help that I've been living in shelters for the past couple of years, and surrounded by some people who drink, smoke weed, or use harder drugs all day every day. Not all of them... but some of them. I just can't seem to find in within myself to work up the motivation to improve my circumstances. It's depressing as hell.

And I know these all sound like stereotypical excuses. This morning I told all my closer friends I was getting clean, and they all gave me this big hurrah... we stood outside our shelter and loaded 3 pipes with chunks of shatter and passed them around... we probably smoked close to $50 worth of weed extracts alone lol And I was really determined this time, but lo and behold, I was back smoking weed with them again about an hour and a half later. And then shit quickly went downhill from there, until I reached the point where I just said *fuck it* and ran downtown and cold-copped a hit of heroin.

Now... usually I'm relatively content with weed, and that's one thing. But I've struggled on and off with meth in the past, and as of lately have been smoking heroin every day. I'm not even sure how long this has been going on for now -- I want to say only a couple of weeks but I think it's been more like a couple of months. Every day I get the meal tickets from my shelter, go and sell them and use the money for dope. But I'm going to be out of the shelter at the end of the month, and back out on the streets (their 90 day policy). And I really did want to get clean and actually save up $20 or so. Then if I ended up on the streets and had a low opiate tolerance and some money, I could always just off myself the best way possible if shit got to be too much for me to handle.

I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm at my breaking point. If anyone actually made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you're in a better place than I am at the moment. I love this community. <3 ",1486838458.0

My DOC's are IV H and PST, I just use my 90x Tramadol script to save money in between scores. Personally I can get a decent buzz off of it if I take 3-400mg.
 Usually my pharmacy gives me Teva (TV 58) or Caraco (377) brand pills. I've had the Amneals in the past and I didn't notice any problems with them. However, this time they're barely keeping me well, and even that's debatable. My pupils are dialated and i'm getting hot flashes like a motherfucker. Unfortunately, I didn't realize they weren't doing shit until I had taken 3x my scripted amount the first day I got the script, so I'm guessing I'm shit outta luck in terms of calling the pharmacy and saying they don't work. 

Has anyone else ever had problems with a certain brand of generic painkillers not working? I've had Amneal suboxone before and I thought it was fine, and the Amneal tramadol I got a couple years ago when I switched pharmacies didn't give me any problems, so I'm not sure wtf is going on.

5tr1wm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5tr1wm/hi_all_my_questions_about_black_tar_heroin/,11,https://redd.it/5tr1wm,RuneBaxe,"Hi - All my questions about Black Tar Heroin / Smoking it, and effects? (First time Tar user)","Hi All, recently started using Tar. In the past I have used ECP and mostly pills but this week was the first I tried Tar. I had few questions about my technique and/or random thoughts I was hoping you guys could help address. I did use the search button to find some solutions but some of these questions I couldn't find, or some of these are follow up questions from the previous questions asked. Thanks all.

1) When smoking Tar on tin foil, is it okay if the tar doesn't move around but stays in the same spot, like if it didn't move but it kept producing smoke to inhale, is that okay?

2) Another thread I read the bottom of the foil shouldn't be that burnt, well all the times I tried smoking the tar, the bottom was burnt all over like heavy dark burn marks, why is that a bad thing?

3) Do you guys end up saving more tar from shooting it then smoking it? Reason I ask is this weekend was the first I tried smoking it and I had 3.5 G's and I'm down to 1. But when I was doing ECP, i did about 1.5G in 2 days but here 2.5, so I'm wondering if I will conserve more H from shooting it then smoking it.

4) Another question about smoking - I'm not sure if this is where they say 'Chasing the Dragon', but when I smoked today, I basically felt pretty good off .2 but I felt like I could feel more if i smoked more, so i added another .2 and smoked it, and it wasn't too much better, but like barely better, so I thought have enough to get by, why not smoke another .2?  So I basically smoked .6g of Tar in 1 sesion, but I can't tell if I felt a huge difference off of smoking .6 then .4 or the .2. Do yall who smoke feel the same way or do you actually feel a lot better / higher from smoking let's say .5G then .25 G?

5) How many times a day do yall smoke Tar, and about how much per each session?

6) I read something about Tar evporating / melting and I noticed that today. Yesterday I had a bigger nug of Tar but the whole bag looked very sticky and had residue, today when I woke up and went to smoke it, the nug was less than half the size it was last night and the bag was still sticky, but i couldn't really tell if it melted or just disappeared, can yall comment on if this happened to you before, and what actually happened? What can I do to prevent this from happening?

7) So the 2.5G I finished was in 3 different bags, there is still a lot of sticky residue, mostly brownish that kinda looks like gel, is that worth salvaging? Since i smoked it, I kinda just put it on the foil, but not all of it is sticking, is there a better way to salvage whatever is remaining?

7A) I read sometimes people freeze the BTH if it's too sticky, or can you freeze it to try and get the residue? Also, if you freeze 1g of tar and smoke .5 of it, do you have to throw the other .5 back in the freezer or can you just leave it in your pocket for the next smoke?

8) Will you smell after smoking BTH? For example if you have to work at 8, and you pull into an empty parking lot near by and smoke for about 20 minutes then head into work, will your coworkers notice you smell like anything? How about will your car smell if you gave someone a ride later that day?


Sorry for so many questions, this weekend was my first time trying so I wasn't sure what was right or wrong.

I typically would spend 10-20 min trying to get a god damn drizzle out until this... 

First, I sit on the toilet (girly, I know). But I have found that if I smack the shit out of my thighs, legs, chest or wherever, I can do a full pee like 10 seconds later hahaha. 

It's really random, but somehow it works. I think it 1) gets my adrenaline pumping and somehow allows me to go, 2) maybe get blood flowing to different parts of your body, idk... 

Sound really weird, but it 100% works. You don't have to like injure yourself, but I always do a solid few smacks to where my blood gets flowing and it's easy money.

Anyone else done this? Give it a try. 

TLDR; If you can't pee on opies, sit down on the pot, smack yourself in the legs/ chest or wherever til your blood boils a little and you are able to pee almost immediately. Lol. ",1486956082.0

Yup and that's what scares the fuck outta me. I'm 37 days clean from heroin and not a day goes by where I don't fantasize about it.

I've lost the obsession to use*, but the thoughts and cravings will most likely be there for the rest of my life.

I'm scared to get high. I'm not scared to cold cop in Newark at 3AM. I'm not scared to stab myself with a needle over and over until I hit a vein. I'm not scared of ODing and leaving everyone in my life disappointed and confused.

I'm scared of that feeling I get when I pull back and see my dark red blood fill that syringe. I'm scared of that feeling when I push down the plunger and it doesn't burn. I'm scared of loosening the tie-up and holding the spot where I just shot up so it doesn't scar.

I'm scared of the next 10 seconds where my body is overcome with the greatest feeling in human history. Why? Cause I want to feel that feeling forever. And it's just not feasible. My body will get accustomed to it, I will start to get dopesick, and the insidious, vicious cycle will start all over again.

And that's what keeps me clean. Play the whole tape through, not just the positives. Just wanted to vent. Be safe, bosses.

So that was the old post. This guy is doing a taper at 2mg a day. He is on 58mg right now. I just stole him from the $1 store, #3 96ct bottles of immodium and we can get more if needed. He has roughly #16 50mg seroquels and #5 100mg seroquels. I think some flexeril to.

I've never given in to temptation during the week, even when I feel like shit.  I think I could control it.  Then again, that's what almost everyone here thought at one point.

On a Christmas vacation a to Grand Cayman several years ago, my Aunt took me to an AA/NA meeting in the town of Hell (real place).  It was nice to hang out with her and have honest conversation.  The meeting was surreal.  The member were all rather intelligent, and all started their drug use thinking they could control it, but they didn't.  I watched grown men cry and comfort each-other, cursing the crimes they committed.  The nicest, most honest man there told of the times in which he stole from his family--his mother and his children--just to get more dope.

I watched a friend nearly get totally hooked onto-desmetyltramadol and U47700.  

I watched a friend of a friend do catastrophic irreparable damage after 3 fentanyl overdoses in a month.  

I used to say I'd never use drugs, they were the devil.  Then a friend of mine gave me a joint, and it was lovely.  I got more, and more and more weed.  Soon I was using an ounce every 2 months, at the age of 15.  I told myself I'd never touch a hard drug, anything other than weed and psychedelics and alcohol.
 
Eventually, I found my dog's pain meds, tramadol, and read that they were non-addictive (bulllllshit).  I, being a reckless fuck, started taking these every once in a while, often mixing it with small amounts of liquor.  

I got busted by my mother because I was a dumb kid and tried to vape in the bathroom and exhale through a gas mask filter.  I was forced to quit smoking weed.  When I look back, I realize I was addicted, because I thought ""oh it's just weed, it can't possibly be addictive or deleterious"".
I really enjoyed tramadol because, frankly, my life is living hell.  I had a shitty family situation; my mum was emotionally and physically abusive, manipulative as fuck, neglectful, and generally narcissistic.  My father was a gorilla of a man who scared the fuck out of me when he got mad; he was a blackbelt in karate, and when we fought, he tensed up and got in very aggressive physical stances, and looked about a millimeter from putting my ass in a stretcher.  If I tried to walk away I an argument (which happened almost every day) they always followed, screaming their side of the story at me.  My father would actually chase me.  At one point, I was forced to use a bullwhip to keep my father from pinning me in a corner.  

My mother and father got a divorce, wit vast amounts of drama.  I got pulled into it, and had to listen to and advise my mum about what she ought to do, an generally parenting her. They used to fight almost daily, sometimes all day, and would storm back and forth through the house, shouting, cursing, throwing things, pushing each-other, threatening each other with divorce, guilt tripping the fuck out of each-other and gaslighting each-other.  All of this happened in front of my sister and I.  Somehow they seemed to think that our family was normal or more peaceful and healthy than normal.

And opioids made it kinda disappear.  They were warm and comfortable and took away the constant feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and confusion about who was at fault for my family.

For a while there, I would consume myrrh for the very light opioid effects nearly every day.  I don't recommend you try it.

After a surgery, I got a hydro script.  I used about a third of it, then disposed of the rest, thinking I wouldn't need it again.  I somehow ended up with a serious withdrawal from going cold turkey after just 4 days on it.  I suspect my body metabolized the hydro into hydromorphone at a higher rate than would those of many others.

My mother, for some reason, gave me a free sample of green-veined kratom, which I absolutely loved, so I got some extra.

Then a friend offered me oxy, so I bought some.  It wasn't that strong, really.  Just more compact than kratom.  I keep my usage in check, just on the weekends, but I realize that I don't want to end up like that poor crying man.  I don't want ok get hooked on pharmaceutical opioids, the risks are too high.  If I ever do fall into a true addiction, I'd much rather it be mere kratom (which has a low dosage ceiling, which is basically an integrated usage limiter.  Its withdrawals are supposedly extremely mild.  After I run out of oxy, my last 25mg, I'm gonna set it aside for a few months or maybe years.  It just isn't worth the risk to me.

**TL;DR** So many people think they have gotten the best of strong opioids, then wake up one day and realize they are junkies.  So I'm gonna stop using oxycodone and other strong opioids, and stick to 2x-per week (only on the weekend) kratom from now on.  Further, I'm gonna try to keep an close eye on my use.

Please don't hesitate to add rebuttal but understand I have researched the subject and I'm also in recovery myself for addiction.

My wife was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia about 18 months ago.  As a caring husband I was devastated for her.  It was a disease that sounded horrible with a life sentence of pain and suffering.  She had gone to all the specialists and even had a spinal epidural/spinal tap to test her spinal fluid.  She went to the ER at least 3 or4 different times in a 2 week period.  They would say nothing is wrong.  Every last one of them bit give her percocet or vico din and send her on her way.

After her Dr diagnosed her with the fibro the pills started coming in.  Lyrica, Vicodin, Klonopin, and a slew of antidepressants.  I was told they would help ease the pain and allow her to live a mostly normal life.  Things did not get better.  She mostly falls asleep on the couch 2 or 3 times a day.  Another thing is the compulsive behaviors such as hoarding and overspending and shopping.  I'm starting to sound like an asshole husband, right.  Well I've truly tried to be patient and understanding.

Well one time she tried to come off the drugs and the withdrawal was evident.  I recognising the warning signs and believe me, I know first hand as an addict in recovery.  I'm clean 5 yrs by the way.

I began researching heavily and long story short evidence all led to 3 things that makes my opinion that this is a scapegoat disease for other underlying issues.

1. Fibromyalgia diagnosis skyrocketed when the pharmaceutical companies heavily marketed drugs such as Lyrica.

2. Most patients have suffered physical trauma in one way or another.

3. Depression and anxiety were often present in diagnosed patients prior to the symptoms and diagnosis.

I'm sad to say this but I feel this is a made up and fake disease.  I'm worried about our future together unless she can recognize this addiction.  Anyone else have the same experiences?",1487080214.0

Saturday night me and the wifey got into it a bit because she wanted be to cop dope and get some weed and I'm not willing to roll those dice. She kept pushing and pushing trying to provoke a fight so I grabbed my shit from the bedroom and decided to sleep on the couch so things wouldn't escalate, I'm seconds away from falling asleep when I see the tell tale sign of flashlights playing across the front of the house which leads me to opening the front door to two local cops.

They come in and ask what's up so I tell them, theyreally to my father, her sister and her sisters boyfriend who are all here who all tell the truth and tell the officers that nothing has happened and it's all good. They talk to her a few minutes and come back and say they have to detain me, obviously confused I ask why and they say I'm being arrested for domestic violence and that she said I hit her. Everyone here but her is in complete disbelief and tell them I never touched her, etc but because she made the claim I hit her. They take me to and her to the hospital, she gets checked out and sent on her way wiggly because she doesn't have any marks or other signs of the alleged domestic and before I'm even booked into county she's at my one dealer who lives by the hospital most likely sucking and/or fucking to get high. I finally go infront of the judge and get bond set and my dad pays it and a few hours later finally get released. She's still at my dealers house and her grandpa that raised her calls me (immediately apologized and said he dunno WTF she's doing this to me as he knows I'd never do what I'm being accused of) and ask me if I can pack her meds and clothes and shit and if I could show her where she's at so he can pick her up and take her to his house. I do the right thing despite being pissed and complied (she needs her seizure meds or could potentially die).

About a half hour after I let him follow me to the spot and show him where she is at he calls me to thank me and mentions she is completely annihilated when  he got there, so while I spent the weekend in country over shit I didn't do she's cheating on me and getting fucking lit.

Like the title says this is not to be preachy everyone likes to fuck around and everyone's got their own shit to have fun but its been a month since my older brother died of a heroin overdose. Me and my family knew he had a pill issue but didn't know it had escalated.  On Christmas eve he overdosed in the bathroom right after Christmas dinner.  My dad and I were able to perform CPR and get paramedics there in time to keep him alive.  We got him into the best treatment, the best rehab, and he tried so hard he seriously wanted to get clean, but after 3 weeks clean he relapsed just once and got bad batch he was home alone and no one was around to help him this time.  He was my best friend, he was my older brother, and for the vast majority of my life, I thought he was the coolest person in the world. For all of his too few years, he was the funniest, goofiest, best person.  Someone out there loves you someone out there needs you alive trust me. You have a parent, sibling, SO who cares and the short term pain of revealing or dealing with your addiction will be greatly outweighed by the decades of happiness you'll get from getting clean.

I have a 20-30mg tolerance, so I have 2 questions. 
1) For smoking and eating, the ""Match Head"" sized balls is a good starting dose?
2) For smoking, 
a) When mixing with weed, will smoking it like DMT be effective?
b) Is there a specific type of pipe (a link would be appreciated) that would be good to use? 
c)Is there any way/place to get a pipe that can be used with an alcohol lamp like a more traditional pipe?
d)Will using a dab rig/ e-rig/ nail for marijuana concentrate be as effective as a traditional pipe?
e) Anything I can DIY?

Yesterday while driving home to my apartment after copping a grm I got pulled over for unpaid registration, which i cant get done until my check engine light issue get solved.  The officer checks my record and finds that so some bullshit unpaid parking tickets from like 6 years ago my license was suspended, its some total mistake on the DOTs record keeping because I know I took care of this.  The cop was really cool about the entire thing but had my car towed.  I managed to keep that grm in my pocket the entire time and didnt get searched in the least.  Cool cop even drove me all the way home while shooting the shit.

So today I wake up and do my last dope, start calling around for a ride to get my car back.  Well of course when I need a favor no one is around to help, so I spend the day stuck at my apartment.  I start calling my dboys and after like an hour of searching through my options I actually convinced one guy to drive out by me to drop off some dope.  Well of course I had to play on his schedule which took like 3.5 hours for him to show up.  I had to walk 2 miles each way to the bank and further to get cigs and food.

Walking is just a pain in the ass, everything gets turned into a long mission instead of a 10 minute thing.  Took me the entire day of fucking around to get everything sorted and together, which normally takes me an hour to do.  I sure feel my follow carless junkies pain, this is no fun.  To be forced to wait on someone else to come through is a bitch.  Luckly Ill have my car back tomorrow tho.

(story fixed with paragraphs),"So yesterday morning my wife and I were having our coffee and sitting on the couch talking about the day ahead of us. We were having an early dinner and her mom was coming over for dinner. that was fine with me because I like my mother in law and my wife is an amazing cook. 

But my wife starts in with me about what am I taking? and please tell her if I am using drugs again. I do have a history of drug use and abuse and I went to rehab 8 years ago for heroin and she knew I was on benzos too. But lately I have been taking .5 to 1mg of xanax at night and passing out and she has been catching on to that. I've been blaming it on drinking at work and after work.

 So she has some errands to run, and I have some errands to run namely coping some heroin. So I get a bundle and sniff two bags and get pretty high. I'm still feeling the 1.5 mgs of pressed xanax I took the night before and I walk in the door 15 minutes before dinner. 

She looks at me and can tell I'm high and asks what I was doing. I get the 10,000 questions but i'm really not that high but she asks if it's the Flexeril that I'm taking. I know something is up because I keep some flexeril in a prescription bottle alongside of my xanax in my desk drawer in my office. I realize that she has been going through my drawers and I go upstairs to my office, open my desk drawers and find that my last 2 xanax bars that were in my pill bottle are gone. 

I go downstairs to confront her but the doorbells rings and in comes her mom. So I can't bring it up in front of her mom. I sit through dinner just thinking about where my last two xanax are. Did she flush them down the toilet?"" Is she hiding them? did she throw them in the trash? anyway, I can't wait for her mom to leave so i can ask her where they are.

 After dinner her mom leaves and I turned to my wife and ask where my two white rectangle pills are. I tell her I use them to help me sleep or help me when my back hurts. I told her the were months old but I still want them. After much back and forth she says that she threw them out in my trash can next to my desk. 

So I casually rush upstairs and start looking through my trash can that is filled with beer bottles and mostly papers. It was pretty hard but I did it. I found the first little bugger just about half way down the can laying on top of some crushed up paper. Then after about 5 more minutes of digging i find the other one. I never thought I would find one much less both of them.

 Since they were goners and I wrote them off I just chomped on one and took a shot of nyquill and settled in to watch The Walking Dead. By the end of the episode I felt like a walking dead zombie. I made myself a huge bowl of ice cream with caramel syrup to top off the xanax and promptly passed out like the dead.",1487032085.0

My favorite:


*The essence of life is such an expensive commodity, that through the centuries, entire generations receive a mere hour of it all told.*

*He who accepts this, accepts the fact that he must die even before he is born. But he, the one who has forever been obsessed with poison, should extract 14 hours to himself from every day. 
These 14 hours are equal to 8,000 years of life lived by 400 generations. But let's just say 5,000 years. Which means that in the course of just one day, I live 5,000 years.*

*In one year, this comes to approximately two million years.*

Yeah. No one wants to read this and im sure it's better for opiatesrecovery but you guys are fam so I wanna post here. Plus, I've been MIA for a while because shit hit the fan in my real life and I've been away from here and I love and miss you all. So, I'm currently sober. Not by choice. Which is never good. But, if I think about it, sober life has some great things to offer. Nothing like heroin, but I'm trying to be positive. Here's my list of things I've found I like about sobriety. 




















Music sounds better. Actually, I listen to music. When I'm high, I don't do anything creative or fun. So what if I'm listening to the same song about heroin on repeat for the 3rd day in a row?

















It makes me want to write more. It makes me post more here. It makes me want to get out all the thoughts in my head rather than just numb them. 


















Food tastes pretty good. Today is day 4 (sorta--you know how it is) and I finally wanted some coffee this morning. The days of WD make me not want to do anything but lie in my own filth and dream of heroin. But today, I was happy to get up and put coffee in the French press and now I'm sipping on it and actually enjoying it. I love food and coffee when I'm high, but I can actually taste it and goddamn is coffee a gift from the gods I dont believe in. 


















It is soooooo easy to cum. Masturbation doesn't give me carpel tunnel or bore me after trying for so long. Yay for 30 second orgasms!! 




















But goddamn would I love a bag right now. But I'm gonna keep on keeping on.

I'm not asking for any specific vendor or anything**

basically, I've been clean for close to a year now. I still smoke weed and cop the occasional suboxone piece from friends w/ scripts, but I haven't used an actual full-on opiate since last may. I mainly fucked with pills- roxies, dillies, percs, etc. sometimes h too, but mainly pills. I was never a full-blown addict. I mainly used once or twice a month as a treat to myself. I never went through physical withdrawls or anything like that. Anyways, I find my life has been super depressing without opiates. I need that release, it was almost therapeutic to me. Nothing makes me happy- hobbies, friends, sex.. nothing feels satisfying anymore.

Being out of the scene for so long, all of my old connects are either out of the game, dead, or locked up. The only things I've been able to find are subs and hydro 5's, which are weak as fuck. I live in a suburban area, so cold-copping isn't a thing. Not to mention my town is crawling with cops at literally every corner, and even driving around with a little bit of bud is nerve wracking (no idea why there are so many cops, I live in a pretty affluent area where violent crime/gang activity is virtually unheard of). I just don't feel like putting in the arduous work involved in finding new connects. I got lucky with who I used to know, they were super trustworthy and kind. I don't feel like going through the effort of finding new people.

so, that leaves me to the darknet. I have an old laptop from high school that I can use as a burner. I'd have to get a P.O. box since I'm living with my parents while I'm finishing college. does anyone have any tips on using the darknet? general scene info? from what I understand a lot of roxies on there are pressed so I was thinking about sticking to OPs or opanas or something.

'For sale: baby shoes, never worn.' 
And
'When he woke up, the dinosaur was still there.') 

So, how about it? Can we tell a story in one sentence? I'll try: 

'I hated crack, until I didn't.'

That was kinda weak...

'How much further to rock bottom,' he wondered as he lay in the shed.

'The man called D had been 10 minutes away for almost 3 hours'

My dboy is actually a dgirl.  She delivers to my porch.  We use a system where I don't even have to interact with her, though I actually do like her.  I've gotten from her for 4 months.  I like dealing with a female.

Problem is: she often has complete garbage, like 2/10 and the best she's ever had was like 4.5/10.  Lately it's been ALL shit.  I don't want to waste my money on the garbage she has, but I don't know how to even begin to find someone new.  

I used to cop with a friend of mine who was really outgoing, but she's in rehab and not coming back any time soon.

She doesn't do it herself, so maybe she doesn't know and her business is suffering for it, I don't know.  Would you talk to her?  Or would you find someone new, and how can I do that?

Then my parents called the prosecutor and convinced him to take time served off the table to force me into rehab.

I know its just bitching and moaning, I've had clean time before and I can do it again. I'll probably take the time off to lower my tolerance, maybe take some psychs and get a plan going for my life. But still, I'm worried about the whole situation. I'm used to the NY court system (where I have the one charge) and I'm not too worried. But I caught another charge in NJ (fucking Paterson fam...its not even worth it these days) and I've never been caught there before. They told me the two buns I'm being hit with is a felony and I can't afford a public defender which is apparently not a free thing there. I'm really hoping I can get drug court for both charges and get the shit dropped or reduced to disorderly. Also my codefendant bounced on that second NJ charge (totally not blaming him, I encouraged him to) and I'm hoping it doesn't reflect badly on me.

I am a longtime lurker/ former heroin addict who finally decided to check in and say hello.

Nutshell story: I started using heroin when I was 17 in the early 1990s and was addicted to heroin and dillies until 2001ish. (There were a few years where I wasn't using in there.)

I went to detox in 2001. It was hell. I entered using fire dope and they RXed low dose roxis for a week and then stopped. No taper at all and no comfort meds. I didn't sleep more than an hour a night for about 2 months. 

I went to a free, religious rehab for 3 months after a week in detox. (I am quite agnostic, but that rehab saved my life.) I relapsed a handful of times after I got out, but never got back into it because of a wisely timed move to another city, a good family support system and the fact that I never quit smoking weed. I never did meetings, mainly because I was always going to smoke pot again and the meetings I attended in rehab were odd to me. It was half a roomful of people who ""quit"" drugs, yet still obsesses about them daily and another half who were there for court and would totally hook me up if I asked them. I guess I prefer to just stay home and obsess alone through the internet, without exposing myself to the folks who can hook me up if I am so inclined. 

I have lurked here and at other forums (any Opiophiles here?) since I quit, mainly because I like keeping my finger on the pulse of the scene and I also like pictures of dope. I like to live vicariously through you guys and also remind myself of why I won't go back. (late d-boys, spent money, WD aches and pains, jail)

I have noticed a trend of bewbs and butts being posted. While I whole heartedly support nudity, please don't stop the real dope porn. I can google a million sets of tits, but I can't really see current sweet, sweet dope pics anywhere else. (Fuck it, post the bewbs and the dope.)

Anyhoo, I hope to be a little more active in the coming days, just to commiserate. You guys are like an NA meeting for me, without leaving the house and dealing with actual people.

I desperately attempted to pass the time by indulging in one of my routine hobbies -- wandering the alleys downtown, searching for any dropped values. Drugs; money; phones; jewellery; gift cards; anything I could make a quick buck off of. And I sometimes manage to stumble upon the strangest items... At the end of the nights, I'm happy if I just come away with half a cigarette or someone's leftover fast food. -_-

Anyways, after a few hours of wandering around and finding nothing, I decide to head on back to the shelter where I'm staying, and on my way, just as I'm about to give up and call it a night, I decide to search the ground at one last subway station and after walking around for a moment or two at the station, BOOM! Lo-and-behold, there's a dimebag right at my foot with a point of some fucking fire H in it. I smoked half of it with one of my friends from the shelter and was even managed to save half for the following morning (yesterday).

So Monday morning I got up around 6 and smoked a bowl of weed and then the rest of the h. At around 9, I sold some meal tickets I had and then went and copped another small hit for $5 which I smoked immediately. And so by the time last night rolled around, I was already starting to fiend for another hit. I was feeling quite burnt out and a lot less ambition than the night before, but I decided to at least take a short walk before heading back to the shelter for the night, because just sitting in there stoned in depressing as hell. I ended up back at the same subway station, and ALMOST IN THE EXACT SAME FUCKING SPOT WHERE I FOUND A POINT THE NIGHT BEFORE, THERE WAS A LOOSE $20 just lying on the ground. I'm like *... you've gotta be fuckin kidding me.* lol I picked that up, went and grabbed another $10 of h and kept $10 for today. Smoked the entire ten-piece all in one session, got back to the shelter around 9pm and passed the fuck out.

Then I had even more good luck this morning! I was up at 5am and went to cold-cop a hit for $5 which only took a couple of minutes. I smoked that and then met up with a few friends. We sold some more meal tickets and when I had a total of $10 I went to buy another paper, and as I was doing so I found another dimebag on the ground with close to a half-gram of speed/meth.

I dunno if this just happens to be a string of unrelated, very lucky happenstance or what. I really have been trying to make an effort to be a better person and friend lately, so I wonder if it's karma finally working in my favor, but at the same time I don't want to get greedy haha

Every other shift or so, I will run a heroin overdose.  Thank god for Narcan.  That said, I understand how it essentially brings the patient into immediate withdrawal symptoms.  I've never experienced what that feels like from opiates but I have from other classes of medications so I believe it must be a terrible feeling.

I do my absolute best to be as kind and compassionate as I can.  I will never judge an individual for drug use or an overdose.  I have plenty of personal issues and overdosing is an incredibly easy mistake to make.

What I see out of overdose patients is a super wide array of responses.  I've had patients thank me for my help and be great people and I've had patients wake up and immediately try to fight me.  Overdoses always make me a bit anxious because of this.  My physical health is what lets me do this job and I have a daughter that relies on me so my primary goal when working is just to stay safe.

I'm not the cops.  You won't get in trouble for needing medical assistance, even if you go to the hospital.  All I want is to keep you alive.

Anyway.  Tell me what life is like from your perspective.  Tell me what an overdose is like and what Narcan is like.  Tell me what you're thinking if you see me or the police or anything.

Not my better judgement is shining through, but it's too late...I've been smoking daily for almost 2 months now. I feel what it does to my body, my mind, and my life and I need to quit. 

What is the best way of opening up to your parents, how do I tell them I don't want to break anyone else heart, I just feel like it really will but regardless I need to tell someone before I get deeper into this and start banging. I've held off with the needle all this time so far, because I realized that's a sure fire way to get addicted right away.

 I wake up every morning just trying to imagine what my life would be like if I never touched drugs. If I didn't have to wake up with a lungful of resin, or having to withdraw and spend all of my time and gas to get more, or even stealing from the only people who love me with no remorse. I don't want to live this way anymore, I'll say it... fuck heroin, and fuck me for trying heroin already knowingly getting addicted. 

I can't bring this to a family who's as broken as mine is. I just can't. I need to do it alone, kratom and a healthy diet.

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5kc0jc/i_just_relapsed_update/


Just a final thank you to all who provided the support and wise words when I was in desperate need.

I ended up doing 33 days at an incredible inpatient center. It allowed me a tremendous amount of time to really get to know myself without the pressures I had previously felt on a daily basis when I entered early sobriety (and had no coping mechanisms)

I've been out for a couple weeks now and my perspective could not have shifted more. In some people's eyes, I threw away a few months of clean time. Fuck that. I'm not even sure how much time I have right now and I could not care any less. 24 hours out of every day is the only clean time I need. 

I won't delve too deep into detail, but I owe everyone who advised me a sincere thank you. I love everyone here. (I don't post much at all but I read just about everything) there will never be judgement in my eyes, I will always love opiates and that's ok. They just don't help me personally anymore. 

Stay safe everyone and if anyone does decide they might feel it's their time to switch up, I'm on reddit daily. I'd be happy as hell to help anyone who asks.",1487088211.0

When I first started using dope in 07, dope was referred to as Brown, Breezy, or Diesel. (This was in Brockton, MA) White colored dope was an unheard of phenomenon. It was all either Brown, or Beije colored dope, that drew up a deep amber color in the rig. Good shit was just referred to as ""fire breezy"".

The dealers referred to us (the users) as ""zings"" or ""fiends"".

10gs was referred to as a ""stick"", for $650-700$(Am I breaking rules here?? Will edit post If I am)
And the lowest denomination bag you could buy was a ""40"", which was a .1- .2 bag for $40. You could be pretty confident in the quality of whatever you were buying.


FAST FORWARD TO 2017.

Brown colored dope is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find.  All the shit going around is ghost white and draws up completely clear. Fent laced dope is being OPENLY ADVERTISED by dealers as ""Fetty"" or ""Fetty Wap"" (no idea how they came up with that name, but EVERYBODY uses that around here now.)

The dealers all refer to us as ""geekers"".

A stick is no longer a stick, but a ""finger"" and it's price dropped dramatically from $650- $700 to $450- $500 (I'm assuming because of the heavy fent presence)

Now, you can never be sure of what you're buying, so you never know how much to do. You know 100% there's fentanyl in all of it, the question is just what the ratio is to actual dope.


If you hit up your guy during early morning hours, or late nights, chances are he won't come outside unless your spending at least 100$ with him (this isn't every D-Boy but A LOT of them. This is the most spoiled generation of dopeboys ever)

The majority of these changes happened in a short span of time. I swear it all hit the fan after 2013. I think a lot of the changes where I'm from, including the price changes, inadvertently are related to the rise of fentanyl.

Also, this is not to say these changes are necessarily bad or good. I know a lot of users on this sub have mixed feelings about fent, but I personally love the shit, as long as I KNOW that's what I'm getting.

But now adays you got these young kids posted up outside of corner stores talking about ""I got that fetty wap"", not even knowing wtf they're talking about.

So the question is, how has shit changed in your cities?",1487218861.0

Give me your feedback!","There are a lot of controversial ideas about addiction. So many people are so ready to write off addicts. My main idea is that addicts are so much more than the disease. The main problem is society writing them off as that disease. 

If society was more accepting and would realize addicts could easily go back to a normal clean life, the heroin epidemic we have right now wouldn't be happening. If an addict gets caught with a little bit of heroin, they are now felons. Almost impossible for most of them to get back into society. So they keep using. 

If we got rid of EVERY possession prosecution, we would save BILLIONS of tax payer dollars, we could get millions of people back into the work force, in turn paying INTO taxes, not taking them. We could also reduce the cost of future convictions, fix broken families, stop the spread of aids, allow them to get loans for houses, apartments, etc so they don't rely on govt. sponsored programs. 

If we were to decriminalize ALL personal amounts of EVERY drug, and focused on being accepting and welcoming to people who were/are addicted the problem would all but go away. No one wants to be addicted really once they've been in it long enough.

If we were to all realize that addicts are just normal people, addiction wouldn't be a lifelong disease. But because of the situation we put these people in, it's so hard for them to get out. 


Everything about this war on drugs has failed, because it failed to help the root of the problem, the users themselves. As long as there's demand, someone will find a way to get it to them. We need to focus on helping those addicted, as well as stop draconian sentences on other drugs that aren't dangerous, addictive, or affect society in any way.﻿

**Keep in mind, the ideas for rehabilitation and acceptance below assumes the user isn't using any addictive substances, but may be using occasional drugs like weed, the occasional beer, and maybe some psychedelics throughout the year. 

These are ideas for moving past addiction, but still being treated as normal people without re-introducing the same problems & ideas that lead us here in the first place (IE: Once an addict always an addict / 3 strike laws / etc.) **

We need to stop the following:

-Making it so hard for people with possession to get a job, assuming they are pissing clean for addictive/habit forming drugs, ex-users can work just as hard a 'normal' worker. 

-Denying student loans to people with possession arrests

-Making it near impossible to find housing, so we're often left looking in bad areas where drugs are abundant

-LOOKING DOWN ON EX USERS. Nothing is worse than feeling so inadequate. You're already feeling low because you were addicted and fucked up your life. We don't need it from you too. 

-In contrast to that, the pity. We don't need you feeling sorry for us. If people really want to help, just treat ex-users normally
-Following that, just treat them like you would treat anyone. Special treatment either way just helps extend the divide. Singling them out just wrongfully re-enforces the notion that they are one step away from fucking everything up again. 

-That once an addict, always an addict. Obliviously that doesn't mean you should be able to go back to using oxy a few times a month no problem again. In that sense, it will never change. But the false notion all drugs are equal and that absolute sobriety is the only way I think is a very flawed notion. That being said, I think some people absolutely cannot touch drugs again. But, to some people, especially me, it's very important that I can exercise self control, as well as have a way to satisfy my urges without relapsing. Personally I use weed whenever I feel a lot of stress, need to unwind, have strong heroin urges, etc. As long as I'm not using it to constantly escape reality I find it isn't a problem. For that reason I don't allow myself to drink a lot, defiantly not by myself. I may have a few beers while with friends, but that's it. 

-From that, I think any blanket generalizations about addicts are usually bad. Everyone is different, and more often than not people categorize people into these addict traits wrongly. But after hearing them for so long, people start to believe them themselves and start behaving the way they were told they were, even when they were nothing like that in the first place. Looking at you manic depression and other mental issues 

-Lastly, solving the underlying mental issues. Now by this I think it's the most important thing that we are finally starting to do. And I don't mean things like group or talking to some crackpot psychologist or psychiatrist, who are the ONLY doctors today that never see the organ they are working with/fixing. 

I mean real neuroscience. With modern advances in brain-scan technology, we can see way better than before exactly what our brain is doing, how it differs from other brains, and most importantly, the physical structures that cause the underlying mental issues. 

For the first time, we can see where there are deficiencies in blood flow, neural transmitters, brain activity, ""crosstalk"", different regions working/not working together, etc. This means no longer do we have to play russian roulette with diagnosees and medication. We can for the finally see what exact medication to use, and most importantly, if it's working. 

I'll bet you, like myself, most addicts start using to self medicate. If we can work past the underlying mental issues, and fix the social taboos and misconceptions, I think we can really finally ""win"" the drug war. 



I'm REALLY interested to get your take. Let me know what you agree with, that you disagree with, what you would change, and what you would add. 

I look forward to your replies!

Info here and questions if anyone can relate.,"I am one of the many idiots who used Immodium (loperamide) to help stave off withdrawal symptoms and wound up getting addicted.  There isn't much information out there so I thought I would make a throwaway and put my personal experience out there in hope to connect with other people.  So back story....

Been on and off suboxone for the past two years.  I was only taking 8mg at my peak but I wasn't able to continue seeing my doctor due to moving to Florida from New England so I tried to ween myself down.  I wasn't having much luck with the withdrawals.  I had some 7.5's to help at first but then a friend of mine from up north said she would send me some.  So for about 5 months I was taking about 2 - 4 mgs a day, would go maybe a few days with out until more came.  Well, eventually she stopped sending the strips and I was once again with that old familiar feeling.  
I have no way of getting any kind of real opiates since I don't know anyone here in the boonies of central Florida but read that Immodium could possibly stave off symptoms and maybe even give you a high.  A lot of ""oh it's just placebo"" out there but I can assure you it is not placebo.  Lopermade is a synthetic opioid that is active in the receptors in the gut however in high doses such as 100mg, it can cross the Blood Brain Barrier and you get high!  Well, I started with just 40mg up to 100mg but by the third month I was taking doses up to 600mg!  Very stupid, I know.  I decided I needed to stop because it's dangerous as fuck at those high doses.  I was having Parkinsons type side effects.
I was able to get four 8mg sub strips from my old friend up north and god damn was I happy to see them.  
My last dose of Loperamide was Friday and it was a high one - around 600mg.  I waited 2 days and took 2mgs and decided to IV 2mg.  Bad, very bad idea.  I wound up going into precipitated withdrawals and it was HORRIBLE.  I guess I didn't wait long enough.  I read that Loperamide is actually similar to Methadone and I remembered I once went on a Methadone binge and while all fucked up I decided to snort some subutex before I knew anything about Bupe......yeah, bad idea - threw me into p. withdrawals.

So my last dose was 5 days ago so far the suboxone hasn't been working very well.  I don't know if anyone can relate to this or knows what they're talking about but this is where the questions come in.  I've been taking about 2mg every 12 hours or so and it's not very well.  I mean, I feel a lot better than I did after the p. withdrawals but still getting hot/cold flashes along with the chills and RTS.  Hot baths work wonders but I figured the suboxone would be working by now.  I know that it removes all the opiates from the receptors and then takes a while to fill back up but would it take this long?  Doubt anyone can relate but if so, let me know.
I know this is really stupid, trust me, but addiction is addiction.  I made this post in case someone is going through the same bullshit and needed some sort of help from someone who has been there or in hope to connect with someone who has been there before.  I hope this helped.",1487206783.0

Now I usually score all my dope from the soutside and pay around $100~ a gram. I could make a gram last about 2 to 3 days depending on how the quality it was. I wasn't an insanely high quantity user anyways. I don't think I've ever scored a Fent batch(Thank God) either.

I thought I knew what quality was until I ordered from the DNM. Even my ""best"" dope from my town was 1/3rd as strong as this gear and that's being generous because I didn't really have a tolerance with that batch. 

This stuff has lasted me 5 days so far and I get a much more natural nod(Compared to Dormin cut dope) and the rush, legs, and come down are amazing. It's like my first line all over again...every single time...

* Heroin can be very strong by itself without Fent.

Anyways, I've been using Xanax pretty much everyday for a little more than the past two months. Binges here and there, and have probably gone maybe 4 to 5 days maybe a week at the most without it at a time. That was probably 3 or 4 weeks ago, since then it's been about everyday and the last time I haven't had any was for a day or two and was a week ago. I can honestly say I didn't seem like I had any withdrawals when I didn't have any. Not even rebound anxiety.

However my tolerance is very high (I usually take 4mg at once, and then through out the day depending on how much I have I'll maybe go through 4-6 more mg. I don't really black out either). I can most likely get by with probably just 4mg a day to be honest, but I need to stop feeding this crazy habit. I don't want to be a Bartard anymore.

So, my question is, I have about 15mg of Xanax left. I have no access to anymore. If you were in my shoes how would you go about tapering off? Never really felt withdrawals like I said, but I've read stories of people who have said the same thing and then had a seizure after 6 days of not taking any and I just wanted to be proactive about the situation and at least do some sort of small taper and not just jump off from what I've been taking everyday.

I'm a chick and I've never bought anything through a dealer before, and I just don't want to get played (more than I am going through a middle) or end up in a super sketch situation.

Anyway, my middle quit the game, I got another suburbanite middle, and now a month later she's out of the game too. I have 4 of my first middle's dope dealer's numbers in my phone from January 2nd. Can I give them a call? What the hell do I say?? ""Hi I'm friends with ____. She called you from my phone before?"" And if this is okay, is it a good idea to make a big first time purchase?

Well, to begin with, nobody, and I mean nobody, can talk a junkie out of using. You can talk to 'em for years but sooner or later they're gonna get a hold of something. Maybe it's not dope. Maybe it's booze, maybe it's glue, maybe it's gasoline. Maybe it's a gunshot to the head. But something. Something to relieve the pressures of their everyday life, like having to tie their shoes.



i know you've all probably heard/read this before but i just wanted to share. watched this movie (drugstore cowboy) again for the twentieth time the other day and these lines have been bouncing around my head (also went through some lockup, detox, and trying to get into methadone treatment so it's even more relevant). 

i tried explaining it to someone the other day, and they couldn't get past the 'tying their shoes' metaphor, they wanted to know what was so difficult about tying your shoes. lol, i tried to explain it just as life's pressures but they came back with 'well that's life you deal with it'

again, just wanted to share a little bit of one of my favorite pieces of art. i'm in a fucked up/rough place right now and just super torn (i know, most of us here are) and these lines resonate at the exact frequency that my mind runs at. it's so spot on, i wonder of a junkie wrote them. burroughs maybe?

I spoke with my SO and replied her some crazy totally unrelated things all the time. And spoke of some really weird things. Every time I said something in the middle of my sentence I realized I don't have any clue about what I was talking lol.

I also got up and wandered around the apartment bumping into things without knowing what the fuck I was supposed to do. All the time feeling like shit from WD.

I remember at one point I got the idea to do some espresso. But instead of grapping the metal portafilter, I took a metal pasta scoop and tried to attach it to the espresso machine :D

At midnight I didn't care about PWD anymore and started slowly taking subs. Luckily it was ok and now I feel fine, not high though... Kind of want to push the dose up just to try to catch a buzz.

5ulalb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ulalb/shitpost/,20,https://redd.it/5ulalb,Craigasm,Shit.Post.,"So. A day after I made a post talking about finding a great new connect and not having to deal with the worst dealer known to mankind, my parents find a rig in my room (in b4 comments about not doing shit while living with your parents). Trust me, I would love to be out on my own but my chronic pain condition makes this practically impossible. I can barely work as it is and was only working to maintain my habit. I was basically making my condition/pain worse by working but hey, junky gonna junk. 

Luckily, I have fucking awesome parents who love the shit out of me. I should've been kicked out months ago but they truly care about me/my well being and truly want what's best for me. I'm tearing up rn thinking about how much they've done for me and what a complete shit-bag I've been to them.,

Any who, I was given an ultimatum: either go to an inpatient rehab or go to the local methadone clinic. I chose the latter. The first few days were rough. This clinic starts you off on 30 mg no matter your background/ tolerance. I was shooting 1-2 grams a day so this first week was somewhat difficult. I told them the amount I was using, that I have taken methadone before (a friend gets scripted them and gives me them for free) and had a tolerance to it but they still started me at 30mg. Luckily I had a bunch of Valium saved up and a refill on my script for them. Also had my OxyContin script and got my Roxy script filled a few days ago, so withdrawals weren't bad. 

When I first got caught by my parents, I was seriously considering suicide. I figured going to the methadone clinic would mean I'd be red flagged and once I tapered and eventually kicked methadone, I'd never be scripted anything ever again. The thought of this scared the shit out of me and I was really close to loading up a lethal dose. I convinced myself to not follow through with this because it'd be a selfish act and I couldn't put my mother through that after all she's done for me. I told my friend who was also feeling similar thoughts about this and he convinced me to go with him to a nearby clinic that deals with suicidal people. They helped me so fucking much. I'm now scheduled to see a therapist which I really need since my addiction has basically isolated me from all of my friends and I have no one to talk to about this. (If you're ever feeling suicidal, please reach out to someone for help).

Also, this same friend who drove me to the suicide clinic referred me to a really great chiropractor who I saw yesterday. Dude is seriously the only doctor I've been to that seems to legitimately care. He did a few x-rays and told me he has to ""go home and do some homework on my case"" to see if he can help me. I'm praying that he can because I've exhausted nearly every resource/option and surgery isn't an option for another 10-15 years (or unless there's some medical breakthrough before then) so needless to say, my fingers are crossed. 

Anyway, I wanted to let you guys know I'm doing much better. No more thoughts of suicide and I've started reaching out to friends that I've been avoiding due to my addiction. I've still got a long way to go in terms of recovery but I'm beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I love you all so much and wish you all the best in life. I hope you all have a great fucking day and remember to enjoy every second on this crazy 🌎.

I was chilling with my girl who's struggling with dope addiction right now and we were smoking a bowl out in her back yard. We were introduced when we were 14 by my best friend and we used to l.o.v.e. smoking in her backyard when her parents weren't home. Our bodies were still in rookie mode and we got so fucked up, sometimes we would pop some bottles too to make it even more fun (unfortunately she started doing dope and kinda stopped chilling then I started selling and she was just like my customer basically). But man we were always smoking up when nobody was home and we both loved it. 

I've been trying to reconnect with her now that I'm out of jail and she is struggling with her recovery (I'm not selling anymore). We've been smoking in her backyard again for the past couple weeks and she just doesn't seem to think its that good anymore. I could see she wasn't getting ripped like I was and I said something, she said that heroin ruined weed for her.

I replied that her expectations were too high and that she's not gonna feel as fucked up as with dope. She said that its not like that, after about 2 weeks of smoking she said that she didn't get high anymore, we smoked 3 bowls and she said she got a mild head rush (I get that too we smoked cigs for that :D) and slight mood elevation but not much more.

I can't believe that, I didn't know that could happen but now its just another reason I don't wanna touch dope. Weed is my favorite drug and I would never want anything to diminish that, ever. That has to really suck because we smoked like 1.5 g between the two of us and she barely got high, not cost efficient at all.

so i've really only been using daily for a couple months. subs and tea for a minute before that too tho. smoked my last bit on valentine's day around this time (so this is really only day two?).

anyway, I do want to get clean. at least for a minute. i've been toughing it out, just finally got thru the projectile vomiting stage (i hope).

my question is, though, if i take 2-4mg subutex or a few immodium am i just re-setting the clock? or will it soften the blow? i'm trying to make it out to a friends show tonight and i don't wanna shit my pants/projectile vomit at the spot...

Now keep in mind my current Xanax tolerance is 4 mgs. But I only had 1.5 today cos that was my last.

Should I wait to take the Oxy, and if so, how long? What should I take to potentiate it?

Ive been a heavy IV user (all substances..but mainly heroin) for 4 years. 3 months ago i decided to get clean & just yesterday by some insane miracle picked up my 90 day keytag...insane..
BUT ANYWAY..
Just a bit ago i went to this mall that never has ppl in it. The only outlet that actually has juice happens to be in the bathroom. So im chilling in there charging my phone & this chick walks in. Shes on her phone & tells the person shes about to take a shit n shell call em back. Ok cool. She takes the very last stall & plops her purse on the floor & fumbles around in it (im assuming to grab her kit) then i hear the distict sound of glassine bags being opened & torn. I was actually a little surprised she didnt try to muffle or do it more discreetly. A couple mins pass....and i hear a sigh of frustration ...couple more mins & an ""oww, ugh, dammit"". So i just come out and say ""look dude i know this is weird coming from a stranger but i can tell youre having some trouble in there... Im also a user. Ill glady help hit you..im quite skilled in this area"" now wait for it.......and nothing. NOTHING? REALLY?! i was seriously a tad bit offended by this. So i let like 5 more mins pass & i reoffer to help..& again, no response. So i took that as my que to exit the situation. BTW she flushed the toilet as i was leaving so im fairly certain she was concious. 

So fellow bropiates & ettas...what do yinz make of this? Would you have accepted the help of a stranger? Been too shy? In shock? Too embarrassed? If you were me would you even have offered to help?

Had tried opiates over the year but over the last 2 years they've consumed me, I don't have nearly as high of a tolerance as some of you guys but at the height of my addiction I'd use a gram of dope a day, up the nose, iv H has never been my thing but pass me some dilaudid and a fresh rig and thats a different story. 

More recently I'd use .25-.5 a day 3 or 4 days a week and pain pills moxed in between or ontop of the H, would use 5-7 days a week. Also more recently I've been trying to kick opiates and have replaced them with coke, but it's all from the same dealer so I just started getting coke and H or pills.

Anyways its a pretty nice place, my insurance is covering like 70% of it and my parenrs are going to cover the other 5-7.5k, its for 35-40 days on the short end from what the guy I talked to said, but it's more of an individualized program so some people are there for 50-60. 

Not 100% sure if I'll have my phone, atleast the first week, so I just wanted to check in to those few people who see my name pop up occasionally, I personally feel I need this, my parents aren't making me do this, I  want this because I have missed lu6t on so much and so much has gone to waste over the last few years to drugs.

I'm looking forward to the tolerance break on mary jane and to be out of the program with over a month clean of all substances will be amazing. That'll be my first time since 8th grade having 30 days over my head.

Just wanted to make one last post before I go in, if I have my phone I'll definitely check in but the dope porn won't help lolol, enjoy your nods, best wishes to everyone on your journey.

Also, do you guys feel like you can tell if you have dope or fent, based on the taste?

i do quarter gram shots of tar where i currently reside, and i weighed out one tenth of this stuff and banged it and was in nodded out bliss for 5+ hours. 

man do i miss powder, but i do NOT miss south east US prices. still, this stuff is worth it and has made my visit home so much more enjoyable.

**First and definitely the biggest my girlfriend who I met online.**

(UK-US) I met her nearly a year ago, and am planning to go visit in May. It was meant to be new years but I relapsed and she didn't want me over like that.
She makes me happy, she fills the hole that I was filling with painkillers.  I won't go into sappy ""I love her so much"" I'm sure you get the picture. 

**Secondly is Hash.**

Cannabis never spoke to me like it did other people, however, Hash is heavenly. Removes all my anxiety without the mind fucking effects of Pineapple Express. I can smoke a joint without having to read the instructions of a pot noodle 13 times, stopping after the third to sit on the kitchen floor to see if that made it clearer.
Hash helps with withdrawals, as we know nothing truly helps, but it's something. 

**Finally is a hobby**

I sold my gaming PC for rent and Dope about a year ago, I have just sorted my financial situation out, enough to go visit America and rebuild my PC with second-hand parts, which to a geek like me is half the fun. I'm even mildly modifying my case to allow for a double radiator and fan on the top where there is currently only one.

This is apparently the exact mixture some darknet vendors use to sell to people as ""heroin substitute"".  That said, my main concern here is obviously safety.  Best methods for getting a nice even mixture? I am familiar with volumetric dosing,  however I would prefer to have this in a powder form.

I have read several different listings that vary slightly in dosage, but seems to be (they claim) about 40mg Fu Fent per gram of powder up to a 1:6 ratio, which if I'm not retarded should be about 166mg per gram.

I have a very good, reliable milligram scale.  So, any advice as to how I could/should mix this? 

Final catch: I've read this is possibly FuFent _freebase_.  If that is the case, it shouldn't just dissolve in water in order to IV, correct?
  
How do these ""professionally mixed"" batches handle this?  
Something tells me these amateur lab guys aren't doing some ethanol extraction on the fent before mixing it into the mannitol...though I guess I could be wrong.

tl;dr -
I have personal batch of fu fent + mannitol I would like to make into one of these fake ""china white"" style things that are going around... Key word being personal--I'm not looking to profit here.

First post on reddit ever right here. Occasionally comment in this sub, pretty casual opiate user here. use hydrocodone once every few months if I find it at work or if its traded to me or something random like that. But I do very much enjoy them on those occasionas. So I found four 7.5 mg hydrocodone pills today. Unfortunately they have 750 mg of acetaminophen in them. I was hoping to take all four at once since I have done around 30 mg of hydrocodone syrup before and I handled that pretty well. I have two questions though. My first is mainly; how can I get that acetaminophen out of them? I've read a little about cold water extraction but wanted to hear some insight from people on here about a good method for doing. My other question: these pills expired in like 2012 or something. 4/5 years ago. they were in a bottle with the cap on, it had been previously opened though since there were only four left. but the cap was on when I found them, in an abandoned house with some possible humidity and other weird stuff going on. Will these likely be less potent as result? And does the cold water extraction cause them to loss any potency? Any help would be greatly appreciated as this is a rare find for me and I want to get maximum enjoyment from them!",1487385910.0

When I was a little kid my older cousin became addicted to oxycontin, and after being kicked out of his home my parents took him into ours. He did really good for a long time by getting himself a job and learning a trade. 

After a while everything seemed to be working our for him, but then he relapsed on heroin for the first time and stole one of our cars for a joyride. After that my parents kicked him out, and he didn't come back until months later. 

He ended up getting his job back, and stayed off of H for another 4 months with my parents drug testing him each week. Sadly the pink cloud wore off and he relapsed once again, which got him kicked out of the house. 

We didn't hear anything from for a few weeks, but then a young woman appeared at our door, his girlfriend. She informed us that my cousin was going to face credit card fraud, so my cousin slammed a lethal dose that killed him. His ""friends"" left him with a needle in his arm, dead. 

I never really understood what happened since I was so young, and my parents never really talked to me about it. I assumed it was all his fault and just pushed my feelings away. 

When I found this sub I learned about the reasons that caused him to live like this, it completely changed my life. I also developed anger against my parents for kicking him out instead if helping him like I would have tried to. I know now that although he chose to take that first pill, he was so helpless to get help. No one understood him, and that was the saddest part. 

So I want to thank everyone here for helping me confront my feelings and understand the lives of opiate addicts. All my life my mother and father told me these people were nothing but scum, and it was all their fault. Now I know the truth.

It still hasn't worn off and was the only way I felt something was IV (this shit does not work by the way, don't attempt was really stupid). The rush was barely there anyways, and it was a big placebo effect. Almost no euphoria whatsoever. Got more desirable effects from sublingual suboxone.

Anyways, I am a bit worried I've done to my veins in this two week timeframe. When I'm not with a friend I am horrible at shooting up by myself. I have skin-popped, gotten bruises, missed shots, more than I have hit my vein in my opinion. I have shot up about 10-20 times in the past 2 weeks in the crooks of my arms and near the veins forearm.. Was wondering if I have done any permanent damage to my veins in that period.... my arms seem to be healing right now, and I had some lumps but they have all gone down significantly. No major swelling or hot spots in any areas. If I stop shooting up now, will I avoid any permanent damage? ",1487360711.0

I crushed one up and started with a small line, about 1/5th of the pill, and snorted it. Fucking Fentanyl. I was rocked but not in a good way. No euphoria, shitty legs, and just overall intense. I ended up puking while trying to not nod all the way out. 

What really is scary about this whole ordeal is that these pills are pressed identical to pharmacy but these are about 3-4 times as strong as a pharmacy 80. It's pretty scary honestly and I am thinking about quitting dope just because of Fentanyl and all of it's shitty analogues.

Anyways, I hit my dealer up and told him that these were not real and he basically said no refunds and that he would make it right with powder when he re-ups. We'll see.

Anyone know what's going on or has experienced this before?,"I've been IVing opiates for about three, four? years now. I always got a good rush from using mostly H, and occasionally roxies if there was nothing else. 

For the last six months or so, I've noticed that my rushes feel really different. At first, it was just that they started to take longer and longer to hit me. It used to take like five to ten seconds for it to start creeping on and feeling good. Then it started taking 15, 20, 25, now it takes about 30 seconds. And when the ""rush"", if I can even call it that anymore, starts, doesn't seem to hit all at once or something. It feels drawn out, so it's not as good. Instead of having really amazing 30 second to a couple minutes of a nice euphoria, I have like five minutes of a very slight euphoria. Like it's taking so long for it to get pumped through my body that I don't get to experience it all at once in a timely enough manner anymore for it to be a real rush. Sometimes if the dope is really poor quality, or the pills aren't very high mg, I won't feel anything at all. Which isn't normal for me. I have a low tolerance. And I've used pills that I know came from a pharmacy/aren't fake, so I surely should be feeling something from them. I do get all the other symptoms of being on H or pills though. Like I'll nod for example. And if I try to do more than I'm used to, which I have before thinking that maybe my tolerance was just higher suddenly for some reason, but that isn't the problem. I still get very weak hits, and from doing an abnormally large amount for myself I'll start nodding way too hard and too much and know that I've pushed it too close. 

I went to the Dr. back in December and he checked my blood for a number of things, and he mentioned to me that my cholesterol was very high and I needed to diet and exercise. Im a skinny small guy but I don't get much cardio in my life and have always had poor circulation to begin with. I'm wondering if maybe this has something to do with it? Like maybe my heart and circulation are so bad that it's really not able to get the rush pumped through me very fast. This seems kind of ridiculous though for it just being high cholesterol to cause this. Is there maybe something else wrong with me that I should be worried about? Or am I just being paranoid?

Either way, it's a bummer not being able to get a real rush anymore :(",1487517395.0

A med that works a tiny bit on our opiate receptors (mu) however it possesses SNRI properties (boost in serotonin & norepinephrine) unlike most opiates. So if you take 50-100mg of Tramadol when you're out of opiates, it's not going to give us higher tolerance users an opiate high, but it can take you out of a bad mood most likely due to the unique mechanism of action it has as a SNRI as well.

It was originally intended for the sacred chapel of /r/opiates though. [Praise Bob](/r/SubGenius) and praise the milk of the poppy, but fuck all y'all junkie jeebus bitches. 

This has been driving me insane for a while now. I could see why (hard) drug distribution/sale charges are felonies, but possession? It makes absolutely no sense. 

For one, you're not hurting anyone but yourself, if that. Two, a felony charge is only going to make a drug addicts' life exponentially worse. Putting a felony charge on a heroin addicts' record isn't going to improve society whatsoever. It's just going to make it so they are unable to get any kind of real job in the future because any time they are background checked, the charge will raise 100 bright red flags and you will not get the job. The only places that will hire you are those that are progressive and have no problem hiring people with records, or places that just don't check your background. 

You would think that in this post year-2000 world we would have progressed beyond the backwards idea that any kind of drug possession (other than weed now that it's being legalized and/or only a misdemeanor charge, depending on your area) requires a felony. How could anyone think it's a good idea to make someones shitty life even shittier? I say this with a pretty shitty life and addiction already. I have no idea what I'm going to do here when I really have to face the music (not going into too much detail) about this charge. Hopefully I can get it reduced to a misdemeanor but who the hell knows. 

This country is seriously fucked, and I think it's going to get even more fucked now that we have a super huge asshole in charge of the executive branch, a bunch of billionaires in his cabinet/pockets, and a legislative branch that is most likely all on his side even though a lot of the other republicans have said they don't support trump. I'm pretty sure they're gonna support him over a democrat that actually makes sense. I really hope this government collapses sooner rather than later, I'd really enjoy complete anarch for at least a week until the ultra-violent militias take over. At least they most likely wouldn't give a fuck about drugs. They might even grow/sell them themselves, who knows? Maybe the world will turn out like the show 'Into the Badlands' and we'll have a Baron in charge who has a ton of poppy filelds with an army of opium smoking field hands who will harvest the latex. I'll take that job!

TL;DR: Drug laws are bad, mmmkay?

5uwv7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5uwv7t/ive_been_experimenting_with_potentiators_for/,15,https://redd.it/5uwv7t,nodsville,I've been experimenting with potentiators for almost a year. Here's a list of what works best (for me),"First thing's first. I'm not, nor have I ever been, an everyday user. I use around 2-3 times a week with one single dose. I still manage to catch a nod using only 15mg of oxy. That's the dose I use every time. With this, I've never gone through any extreme WDs. I may get some mild symptoms, but it's manageable. And some of these supplements below can even help with those symptoms. Here's my ritual:

**DXM** - The secret to keeping tolerance as low as possible is NMDA antagonists. I've found them to really enhance everything about it. The only thing it doesn't seem to effect that much is duration. It will still last as long as normal. DXM wise, you don't need to go high at all. 30-60mg max. Usually 45mg. Take it about 30-35 mins before dosing.

**Agmatine Sulfate** - This seems to be quite an awesome supplement. It is a NDMA antagonist as well & is used as a pre/post workout type of thing. It increases nitrous oxide to improve muscle pump. Also aids in helping your muscles repair after training. And I can vouch for that - using it as a pre workout definitely gives more of a pump during the workout. With that, it also helps with tolerance towards opiates (and other drugs, but that's another topic). I find it's best when you have it built up in your body after taking it daily. But start out with 500mg in the morning & night. Before an opiate dose, I do 1g. 

**Magnesium** - Interestingly enough, yes I do find taking a daily magnesium supplement to help a bit with preventing tolerance build up. Yet another NMDA antagonist. It's important to note what type of magnesium to get since there are a bunch of forms. You need chelated magnesium or magnesium glycinate. These absorb best in the body & therefore, more effective. 200mg after breakfast & 200mg after dinner (good to eat with food).

**L-theanine** - I love this substance. I get a bit of anxiety from time to time and I find this really helps relax me without the overwhelming sedation benzos comes with. I mix with caffeine & it basically cancels out any of the negative effects from the caffeine. And also use that mix as a pre workout with great results. Take 200-400mg 30 mins before an opiate dose.

**Tums** - Obviously only applies if you're eating your pills. To be honest, I just use this as insurance. Like a ""why not"" type of thing. It may allow your body to absorb more of the pill, maybe not to amazing extents, but it can't hurt. 2 tums 20 mins before dosing.

**Grapefruit Juice** - How many times have you heard this one before? Well, this I find not necessarily potentiate effects, but it does make them last longer. The acidity though could effect absorption of the oxy so I would just make sure I finish drinking before taking the tums. Start drinking sometime an 1 - 1.5 hours before dosing. an 8oz glass is all you'll need, but I really love the taste of it so I usually end up having more throughout the high.

EDIT: While WHITE grapefruit juice is almost always recommended, at least be sure your juice is **100% JUICE!** Most of the red stuff is not 100% juice, while most of the white is. Keep that in mind.

With all of that, all of these substances I've listed are for the most part very safe on the body, if not maybe even good for you in a way! GFJ has plenty of Vitamin C :) But anyway, yeah I've really found these things to help make the best out of my pills! If anyone has anything to add or recommend, let me know what you think!",1487482431.0

So here's what happened...

I wake up this morning way earlier than usual. I'm up but I'm half asleep still. I can't get back to sleep so I figure I'll watch some TV and slam my morning dose. Once that's out of the way, I head out of my apartment to grab a smoke. As I'm smoking, I'm nodding out pretty hard, so I figure I should probably go back upstairs and go back to sleep.

I end up passing out for another 4 hours or so and when I wake up this time, I actually feel rested and like a normal person. It's been a little while so I figure I'll get another shot ready. This is when my nightmare starts...

I have two bags, that aren't in the pocket I thought I left them in. I start to mildly freak out...I check a few other places, nada. Ok maybe they fell out of my pocket when I went for a smoke. So I canvas my route outside, again, nothing....so now I'm full fledged freaking out. I start praying to JJ and looking everywhere. Of course I can't remember shit.  After looking everywhere I got nada. I basically resign myself to the fact that I'm a fucking idiot and lost them, they are gone.

One last place to check in my apt, the trash can. So I open up my trash, dig through it a bit. Low and behold, two bags of dope sitting at the very bottom. I must have fucking thrown them out!

Anyways, I praise JJ and go on with my day with a lesson learned. Curious as to how many of you all do the same thing to yourselves....?",1487477612.0

So that got me through a few hours today.. getting off of benzos so my anxiety is through the roof.. fighting the urge to take more benzos so I attempt to find more Oxy.. none of my connect have it. Except for my asshole aunt.. she gets 10/325mg bananas.. but this month her doctor switched her over to the pink 10mg Oxycodone IR's.. so what does she do? Charge $15 a pill compared to 3 for $25... brutal and irritating.. so I buy the 2 10mg Oxy IR pills for $30, in almost disgust but hey this is the world I introduced myself into, for now I can't change the people in it, only myself, anyways, I get home and the one is dirty!!! How do you get what it looked like a dried up boogie on a pill!!! It was gross... so I scraped away until it was clean (I now had a 10mg pill and a 9.9999mg pill lol). Usually I would eat two and then snort one to be where I wanna be, but if I ate just two, it wouldn't cut it... so I snorted both.. with 1mg lorazepam oral (before I snorted it to boost the high).. it hit me hard compared to the orally I prefer my original method but who am I to complain right now.

Right, THE post that requires me to use a throwaway as I'm sure to get crucified for this. But if it helps someone, great.

I only ever dabbled occasionally with light drugs such as weed, snorted the odd rail of coke at a stag do, that kind of thing. I'm a n00b basically, but that also makes me the 99% of people who might stumble upon this reddit. 

Recently, and out of interest, I tried experimenting with different forms of opiods, starting with codeine, DHC and oxys. Using recommended dosages on Erowid, being opiate naive, well, none of these did much for me. Bit of warmth, bit of relaxation (but had been more 'high' just smoking weed, and more 'calm' by trying benzos) - bit nauseous... nothing exciting.

So I thought, screw it, let's go for the biggie and be done with it, chalk that up as ""I tried it once"". So I got myself a gram of H from a reputable source, in its #3 form to be specific. 

So here's the problem: If you look for info about H on this reddit you have only one kind of comments to find, which is ""Never try it because it's soooooo good you will never want to stop"". If you go on erowid you will read comments from people who allegedly experience TINY dosages like 30mg smoked and wrote ""It's as if I was KISSED BY GOD"". And that's actually mild - stop now, go on erowid and read it for yourself. ""BRAIN ORGASM"", ""BETTER THAN SEX"", ""THE BEST FEELING OF MY LIFE"" etc... 

Or my personal favorites, the numerous (!) threads asking ""Should you try heroin before you kill yourself"" because apparently being on H is the 'pinnacle of human existence', and will cure you from wanting to off yourself because you'll have discovered that life in fact, does not actually suck if you have the right chemicals in your brain. Here's one: ""https://www.reddit.com/r/SanctionedSuicide/comments/573u4v/if_you_are_planning_to_kill_yourself_without/""

Mmmm.. Ok I think to myself, I better be careful with this, so I buy a milligram scale (cost me an arm and leg) and research how to 'chase the dragon' the proper way with a minimal of waste. 

So I load my foil with 25mg of the stuff (erowid said so), do it all properly, let the little blood-like droplet roll down and inhale a bit, thinking 'holy crap here comes the big smooch from GOD himself"". And, erm, nothing. So... I wait 10m (because reddit and erowid told me to) and try again. Nothing. So I try again, the whole 25mg. Nothing. 

So I could have stopped there but a quick look at this sub makes me think, mmm, well, where's my kiss from god? Where's the bit where I fly above the bed like that guy in breaking bad? Basically, where's my 'pinnacle of human existence'?

So the next day, I load up 100mg on the foil. That's 3x the 'strong' dose of what erowid says. Same experience. 

Eventually, a friend come and visit. He's drunk and so am I. He pops 2 oxy IR 5mg for good measure and we both take the 875mg remaining (400 something per person) and smoke the shit out of it during the span of 2 hours (It takes works to smoke that much). By now, surely if Erowid had its number rights, we'd both be ODing. Well, besides ""I feel a bit relaxed"" and ""my face feels hot"", nothing than some good strong indica and a valium 5mg couldn't have done.

So, long story short, here's the thing guys: I know some of you suffer from addiction, I'm really sorry, I was once an alcoholic and I know addiction is horrible. I really genuinely wish you the best. But can we please stop the complete BS about smoking this stuff being better than sex with 72 virgins please?

Yes it's dangerous, yes it's addictive - I'm sure it is. But if you really want people to not join the junky club, don't tell people 'never to try it' and don't exagerate the experience. I haven't tried (and won't try) injecting, and maybe injecting is different - but there are numerous - no, countless threads on this reddit about smoking the stuff that give it too good a reputation.

It feels kinda like taking a valium and drinking a couple of beers. It doesn't give you a hangover. It has some anxiolytic properties. It might make you puke, but no, it won't transform you into a junkie at the first hit and it won't make you see God. If you want to see God, take DMT, now that's an experience that does blow your mind (litteraly). 

TL;DR: H is a dangerous analgesic that's also completely overrated. ",1487465108.0

What I'm trying to say is I don't usually take oxymorphone, so I don't have tolerance for it. If I take it for 2 days I shouldn't get much withdrawal off it because I haven't been using it for a long time. But if oxycodone and oxymorphone are basically the same drug, then I'm just feeding my oxycodone habit.

Not the most comforting thing to exist.  I never thought people would put fentanyl in fucking ""xanax"" pressed bars.... but here's my encounter with just that.

I acquired some ""xanax"" a couple months ago from a friend.  He said that his plug got them for him, and that they were weirdly thick compared to normal, but that they were probably just re-pressed with an RC benzo.

I cautiously nibbled on one, and didn't die, but got a massively powerful euphoric nod (complete with rushes of orgasmic itch-free bliss) from a single quarter bar.  This was, of course, a little odd.  This wasn't xanax, clearly.  I assumed that it was just an RC like etizolam, which I had heard was much better feeling than xanax.  

But it should be noted that these things didn't do *that* much about anxiety, constricted my pupils like mad--to pinpoints at a quarter bar--made it literally impossible to stay awake at half a bar, and felt generally like an opioid.  I didn't catch on though.  I kept popping them intermittently, and had rather a hard time quitting them after the first time I used them (a three day binge, which concluded in something that felt suspiciously like opioid WDs).  

But I still didn't catch on.  When I was down to a bar and a quarter, I had a trip that was overly intense, and I tried to terminate it.  Not termination occurred, but the body load (which was the bit that was troubling me anyway) was replaced with a beautiful warm sedated feeling.... hmmm.  This definitely isn't xanax....

But wait there's more.  It took until someone alerted me to the me fact that it sounded like I had fent laced bars for me to figure it out.  I Googled it, and sure enough, it seems to be a fent press based on the images.  The bars have two layers, a thinner bar of some sort with a half-millimeter veneer of material pressed over its surface, making it look like xanax.

Anyway, I figured this out yesterday night.  I binge pretty hard most weekends, because, y'know, I can.  Plus I don't have anyone to hang out with, so it's not like I have to act sober.  Thus I figured ""score, time to snort fentanyl!  Awesome!""

I cut off an eighth of a bar, knowing that a quarter taken sublingually was enough to get me blasted and that it was about 2x as potent intranasally.  I then cut this eighth in half.  I was already very high on kratom (burned about 11g today), so I only had this 16th of a bar, insufflated.  After about 30 minutes, I was markedly higher, but felt it safe to try a little more, so I snorted the rest of the eighth.  This went well, and was very enjoyable, if not any more euphoric than oxycodone.  To be honest, I definitely prefer oxycodone and hydrocodone to fentanyl any day.

About 6 hours later, I had taken another 2.5g of kratom (red vein, so quite sedating) and decided I wanted to go back to fent land.  I cut off another eighth and snorted the whole thing, thinking that, since I was actually closer to sober than I had been earlier
In the day, this should be a safe dose.  

I sat down to bang out some calculus homework, and realized that very suddenly I was feverish feeling, barely able to keep my balance from sedation, nauseated as fuck, and barely breathing.  I stumbled to the bathroom and dumped 25mg of IR amphetamine salts in my mouth, crushing it up and swilling it around; this was the best thing I could do without narcan.  

I resolved to keep an eye on myself and call 911 if I didn't get better in five minutes.  I did, obviously get better.  My assumption is that I hit a hotspot in the bar, and that this caused the dose to vary significantly between the two instances.

Unfortunately this also means that I'm not sleeping much tonight, thanks to having to emergency speedball.  4:20am has come and gone without a sign of sleepiness...  felt amazing though, so whatever.  Best fucking nods I've had in months.  

**TL;DR** look out for fent bars, they appear to be very uncommon, but still are circulating on the streets.  They seem to be unevenly dosed, and should be treated with extreme caution.  I accidentally acquired some and came worryingly close to ODing on them today.

Take care everyone.  Love you guys.  ",1487585038.0

My buddy wanted to go outside to smoke a cigarette. I proudly and loudly don't smoke cigs haha; I try, but they make me so much more sick  physically than any other drug on the earth, including moderately large amounts of alcohol 

So, I grabbed my chillum (a new term for the straight glass pipe that about a decade ago would be a ""bat"" - bigger than a one hitter. Also sometimes called a ""glass blunt"" but these only fill up to like 1/5 of the very front in a small bowl. Maybe one 5-6ish people could hit it before totally cashed)- I grabbed my chillum and walked out in my sweatpants and shirtless

Was lighting my chillum when buddy says ""/u/southern___psychonaut STOP IT. He's never aggressive esp in speech to me so I quickly hid the chillum in my pocket and turned around to see _____ police department officers walking up to us. Asked us if we had seen two dudes and described them

And this is where I have a bit of an issue. Tried to ask one of them if I needed to be on the lookout for them, if they were dangerous or armed. That's when he told me to go back inside  because I ""smelled like Seth Rogan,"" so I took my hint and ran inside to hide anything I could get my hands on.

This is a decent sized city tho and in the last year I've had 5 encounters with cops while either being caught red handed with a tiny bag of weed, and each time they've all smirked (with good and bad connotations ofc) and basically let me take the escape haha

But seriously; they weren't gonna waste any time and resources during a manhunt on a 0.26g bowl of herb yknow

I live in a somewhat progressive southern city. But I was surprised heavily when dismissed so rudely asking about potential danger in *My neighborhood!!! Is this normal?? Especially with something as basically chill as herb 

Also, yes. I'm hella grateful that they gave me an out!!!!! If they wanted to question me or saw even a glimpse inside my door I could be in a fessed booking facility tonight haha!

Sheesh that was nuts 

EDIT: so, I don't live in a house, I live in a massive apartment complex that is on top of a small mountain/hill, and my building is toward the very top. When stepping out my front door, the only people who could see me would be my neighbor across the breezeway. It is especially odd to see cops that far up the hill without their lights flashing or something obviously going down- that's why I was concerned over whether or not the dudes they were looking for were dangerous or not. Seriously, you've gotta drive to the very top of the large hill past 20-30 other buildings to get to mine, and it is often p hard for even people on the phone w me to find the building. I've lived here for over a full year now and I've only ever seen my neighbors here, and it's super quite rare for me to go outside with weed cuz so many of my friends smoke cigs that I'd be going out there every five minutes with a bowl if i went w all of them. This is the first time that a cop has ever spoken to me at my apartment; the other times I've talked about have been in quite various, random, and reasons-for-things-completely-unrelated-to-me. Yes I'm lucky; but, I also am more careful than this post seems to come across. I was nodding tf off when typing it last night ",1487578904.0

I thought I would take some time to share something I think is super important. Please know your rights when you have an incident with the police. Getting pulled over is always a nerve wracking experience. Even worse when you know that you have drugs in the car.  My tips refer to small drug purchases like we deal with every day. Rule #1 while in the vehicle, keep nothing drug related off your person. No empty baggies, spoons, roaches, pipes nothing . KEEP A CLEAN CLUTRER FREE CAR!! Whatever drugs you buy or have with you goes directly up your Pussy or under your nuts.  The only time you are allowed to be strip searched is after you've already been arrested down at the station . The cops WILL LIE TO TRY AND GET UOU TO BREAK and admit to having drugs on you . This can only lead to one thing -Your arrest.   If they ask if you have drugs on you say No. if they ask are there drugs in the car say no not to my knowledge. If they ask to search your car say no. If they ask to search you say no. Because if they have probable cause they will search you and the car and don't have to ask permission. They will lie and say the dogs are on the way, they will tell females that a woman cop is coming down no matter what don't crack. They will say I know you have drugs on you if you give them up you will get in a lot less trouble . Do not give in. If you give in and give up the drugs all that will happen is ur ass is def going to jail now ! 

 Don't let them scare you with jail threats . The second it is getting hostile stop talking . Say am I under arrest or can I leave . Legally all you have to tell a cop is your name and give ur info. That's it. They can look up other stuff about u they need to know . Believe me if they have propable cause to arrest u they will and nothing will help u! The reason you're not in cuffs yet is because they don't have anything to arrest you for ...yet . Don't rat on yourself ! 

Tell whoever is with you in the car to keep it simple . Do not get into conversations w cops they will try and pin you against each other with lies. Tell everyone to shut up and chances are you will be able to go home. Don't get spooked . Even if u are arrested most are misdemeanor charges and you will be released in a couple hours. But most people dig their own grave when it comes to this. Either they crack and hand over the drugs , they have shit laying around the car , or have active warrants etc ",1487564991.0

Withdrawals have not been terrible, although I do have the full pharmacy to help (unlimited xanax (which I'm experienced with and have no affinity for addiction) gabapentin, zopiclone, metaclopramide for nausea, Imodium, etc.

My first day was major anxiety which I knocked out with xanax, and since then I've been surprised with only body aches, ZERO appetite, lethargy and inability to sleep for a few hours without crazy hallucinations.

Last night the all over body restless syndrome got bad to the point gabentin wouldn't help and it took a fairly hefty dosage of xanax to get me reasonably comfortable.  Oh I'm also taking the best multivitamin money can buy, drinking a shit ton of water and taking L-Acetyl-Cartine, DLPA, L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine, along with top quality Omega 3 fish oils.  

I do have to confess I have been using Dexedrine (dexamphetamine) every now and then which I find miraculous for WD symptoms and gives me lots of energy - is this really stupid of me to be fucking around with dopamine like this when I'm trying to recover?  I also take 40mg Citalopram daily which I have done for years (psychiatrist said not to fuck around with that dosage till I'm clean for a few months)

Is this normal for Subs withdrawal at day 5?  It seems to be progressively getting worse and I've experienced no gastro/diahorea yet which I find strange, but have had instense waves of nausea.

It's the suicidal thoughts that press me down and the rush of all things I've been suppressing and now I'm dealing/grieving about that should of been done months/years ago. This is why I turn back, I put thoughts into actions sometimes and have followed through 2/3 times, but luckily, failed. I know that this is common with coming off, I think logical as best as I can. What advice do you have that helps with the mental side of coming off. It's fucking torture (excuse my language I'm sorry).
Thank you.  ",1487556189.0

I've done research and can't find any answers on the web. Does anyone know how/why the Vivitrol shot blocks your receptors for roughly a month?

For anyone that is from the land of crabcakes and scramble... or if your area gets scramble too, I have a short background story, followed by a question.

I am a longtime user of the blues, and very rarely mess around with the brown stuff.  I'm not great with the lingo, I'm not great with sourcing it, I'm all-around pretty amateur-ish with it.

Anyhow, around my way, it's very tough for me to find ""raw.""  Also, I don't really ever cold-cop.  I've done ""raw"" about a dozen or so times, never shooting it, only snorting it.

So, I was super low on cash ($20), and not much hope, so I drove out to this area that's pretty ghetto, pretty slowly.  windows down bc it's a nice day, and take my chances.  I'm a clean cut white guy so this will be pretty different; I'm certainly out of my element and stick out.

I hear people all over, shouting ""GIRL!... GIRL!...GIRL!""  Damn, I'm pretty sure that's crack.  I guess I'm looking for boy??  Even though I'm pretty sure that's scramble, I know I'm not gonna have much luck asking specifically for ""raw.""  Anyhow, this one dude flags me over, and asks ""you good?""  I say, ""Boy?!?""  He replies, ""iz you da po-lees?""  I, of course, say fuck no... Anyhow, let me skip some... his homegirl had some, he asked how much, I say I got a $20, he says, ok two.

Homegirl comes over, serves me... BOOM... very easy.

However, I really don't want scramble, but it's better than nothing.  I've had scramble a couple of times, so here's my question.

I can definitely feel it.  They were in those big capsules that typically fill about a half gram's worth of stuff (not saying this was .5 at all, just wanted you to have an idea of the size of the capsule).

But the shit looks pretty white, VERY fluffy, and small little balls of fluffy powder.  I bump the first one, feel pretty good.  Anyhow, does my description sound right?  This is scramble, yea?  Anyhow, that's my story.  Maybe it entertained you, maybe you can answer.  I don't like scramble, and it's not a whole lot, but I figured I'd ask what you all thought.  I tried taking a picture but it didn't turn out great. Perhaps I'll post it shortly...  thanks for reading!",1487534847.0

I don't know about you guys but after the first few times I tried percocets in high school deep down I knew that I loved opiates and would probably at least try heroin at some point. For anyone who is right in the beginning of their love affair with opiates I'm about to drop some knowledge that will make sure that you'll never become dependent. Let me repeat that with some emphasis,  
If you're not yet physically dependent on opiates, and you follow my instructions TO THE LETTER, I will inform you how to be able to use opiates daily, for as long as you want, without EVER becoming physically addicted!!   
That being said, as with all things, you can become psychologically addicted to them still, but won't have to deal with the horrible physical withdrawal from opiates.  Okay so their is only one thing that you need, naloxone. If you are using opioids with a long half life(methadone, LAAM, poppy pod/seed tea, etc..) you will need to use naltrexone instead.  I'm going to reiterate, you CANNOT ALREADY BE PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT, even if you have been physically dependent in the past but current aren't this will not be as effective. So you need to get as much naloxone as you can, ideally not the liquid because that doesn't have a long half life.  Okay so now you have your naloxone and you want to go get high, so just go get high like normal, you don't have to do anything differently yet. Okay, now that you've gotten high and have come down(you don't need to wait until you've come down all the way but it'll be a waste of your high if you don't), you now need to take a standard dose of naloxone. Since you are not physically dependent you won't have any precipitated withdrawal, you could even take this at the peak of your high and not get precipitated withdrawal, don't do it, it'll completely remove your high, but you won't get sick.  Now, if you are 100% compulsively adherent to doing this after every  day that you use opiates, you could do this every day, and not only will you NEVER BECOME PHYSICALLY DEPENDENT but your tolerance will also never increase, so the same dose you used on day 1 will give you the same effect after 5 years on doing it.  Now that being said, once you start saying, ""I ran out of naloxone but I can just get high without it one time and I'll be fine"", which is true, but it leads you down the path of forgetting to do it more and more, and before you know it your addicted. So I know this is kinda a pain in the ass to make sure you have naloxone, and remembering to do this every day after you use, but it's way less than becoming a full on WD daily junkie. One last note, be sure to use the naloxone before you go to bed that day, I know it's inviting to just use your nod to go to sleep, but those extra 8-12 hours of opioids being bound to your receptors makes a big difference for tolerance and addiction, DON'T DO IT.",1487526457.0
