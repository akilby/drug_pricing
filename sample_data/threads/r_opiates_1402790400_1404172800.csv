2878re,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2878re/opiate_pet_peeve_hour/,78,https://redd.it/2878re,PercoThrowaway,Opiate pet peeve hour,"Hey guys. I figured this would/could be a dope post to laugh at/cry at/cringe at/release anger at. It could be anything, ranging from ""I keep telling my little brother to quit railing our moms 7.5mg Lortabs"" to ""last time I shot up a whole gram and my nose didn't even get itchy, any way to get my tolerance down?"".

 1. My biggest pet peeve currently are the people doing opiates in my area. Opiates are fucking boooooming around here now, and it seems like most people between 15-30 have at least tried an opiate(not that extreme obviously but DRAMA amirite). I'm also known as the ""guy that knows everything about drugs"" in my large group of friends(not that they call me that, but I do a shitton of research/harm prevention for both personal use and because I know most of my friends are dummies and wouldn't look up past the first link on google). I wish I had a dollar for every person that come to me asking if they can snort/if I wanted to snort some lortabs. I try explaining to them the multiple reasons why this is a terrible idea, and yet some of them still do it lol. Or when they do whatever drugs mixed/with booze/weed/whatever and after ask me if it was okay or not...

 2. also fucking hate the itchies. I'm the only opiate addict out of my group of friends, but the majority of them have now tried hydro and oxy(i have one friend thats a semi-frequent user, think hes slipping sadly). Since I explained to them why they were itchy as shit after taking 20mg oxy they now know every time i'm on an opiate and lowkey call me out on it lol

 3. Another peeve is the fuckin dealers. A friend came from a couple hours away to cop. The dealer doesn't answer until like 5 hours later when my friend is almost home. Next day the dealer doesn't answer. The next day the dealer answers later and says 100% today.

 4, I went and semi-cold copped last night. I had to pick this dude up, find his uncle. His uncle had to go re up, so I follow him in my car. He stops at 2 corner stores to get a fucking loosie, finally drives to the trap to reup, takes 15 minutes, has me drive around the block to pick up the dude and the stuff finally. Two hour ordeal for .9

 5. Asshole fiend hydro/oxy addicts that try to middleman me like I don't know pill prices so they can get a big return from the dealer. Same dude said he had suboxone and that it was the same as oxycodone(not literally the same drug but everything else................I should of told him about sub but fuck him)

 6. This usually happens late night/early morning : nodding the fuck out(sometimes with a couple beers in me and/or some mary) in the middle of a text and it going all ""so yeah im realjhjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj"" on me. Or sometimes i'll nod out, eyes closed and all but my thumb will keep typing but missing all the right keys lol like ""I know right I can't wait to go up to the univershgekofelghw "". Actually nodded out writing this one no joke.

also just had a quick question : does tonic water potenate(sp) heroin(east coast powder, usually light brown) like it does hydrocodone/oxycodone/i'm sure other opiates? I'm sure it does but I was just curious if anyone knew 100% for sure and if it potenates further/less/the same.

Not opiate related but I have 0 fucking breakfast food in this house.

i'll add more as I think of em, I just wanted to get this posted. Stay safe and nod on! Go Range- oh wait. shit.

This guy just got out of rehab for heroine. He was in a hotel room alone. He was high on pills already and decides to shoot up some heroine. He ODs instantly, falling to his knees and has his head on the floor. His mom finds him there after he doesn't respond to anyone for awhile with the needle still in his arm. The final ruling said that he choked on his own vomit.

 I've got about ~20 cottons that I used to filter my ECP, and maybe 5 or so mixed in that I used for Tar. I want to not have to go early as fuck to go cop tomorrow morning, so I figured I would use these cottons as my wake up shot. Most of the time, I leave a little bit of dope in the spoon and soak it up with the cottons, and put them in the caps of my rigs, and even squirt a little bit (few drops) of dope on them sometimes. 
My question is, what is the absolute BEST way to crank all the opiate goodness out of those cottons to do a decent shot? I have just mashed them in the cap with some water before, and I have taken them out and cooked them in my spoon for a little and then mashed them up. Any suggestions?

This is my safe place lately.,"Four years ago i was really messed up. I had been working in this bar for years (started when i was 17) and the place had in-house coke and pill dealers.

I was only 20 but was allowed to drink as much as i wanted, i had a fairly serious coke habit that i supported by middling and stealing and i was taking hydros and oxys like they were gonna stop making them.

I pretty much dont remember my 19th year except that at some point i moved out of my moms and got my own apartment which allowed me to stop pretending i wanted anything but to get fucked up. And that was all i did.

One night after work i was sitting outside the bar smoking and drinking when a friend of one of the bouncers started chatting me up. She was a cute redhead, an actress, a student. She had her own car and could wake up in the morning without taking any drugs (i think id forgotten regular people did that).

We started seeing more of eachother and she moved in to my apartment after a month of actual dating. She got me clean, like really legitimately clean (except for weed but i never counted that). She made me feel good, something i hadnt felt without drugs since junior high. We got a bigger apartment, we saved money together, went on vacation (i was normal! Like a real human person!) we had a cat and a nice life.

It lasted 3 years (yesterday was the anniversary of our breakup) and the last year was horrible. She cheated, i used again (but not anywhere near as bad as before). Then we got into a very physical fight where she fled our apartment, leaving me in an electric and heatless apartment since they were in her name, and we have not spoken a word to eachother since. I had a really bad few months after that, tried and failed to overdose, gave myself alcohol poisoning, blacked out and woke up in other parts of my city with no idea how i got there. 

In the past 3 months i have gotten my life together again, i re-kicked coke and got my drinking under control, remade friends and even some new ones, i even managed to save nearly 1000$ towards a car as she took ours when she left. But im on pills again, only small dose and it IS partially for back pain but they arent prescribed.

So, today i saw her. For the first time, with her new boyfriend. She was texting and didnt see me, walked right up to me looked up and made eye contact for a full 2 seconds before walking right away. Instant panic attack, sweating and scared and i bolted and couldnt stop crying. It was really horrible and proved to me that i need some form of closure from her. 


This is already too long and im sorry but i dont have anyone to talk to and im popping hydros right now just trying not to think about the look on her face when she realized it was me. Fuck. What do i do?

Though, I really want to start participating more anyways, so here I am!

So on with my half rant.. I just slammed my last shot of H about 20 minutes ago and was rather disappointed and annoyed. Earlier today, about 8 or 9 hours ago I picked up a half g of some rather bomb shit. When I got home, I threw the whole rock into my cooker and got it all prepped. Lately, we have had some pretty bunk stuff going around and have been slamming the whole half g's at a time, however this dope cooked down super, super dark, almost black. After drawing it all up into my rig, I thought to myself, ""Last time it was this dark, I OD'd..."" That happened a little over a year ago. But anyways, I decided to spray half of it back into my cooker. DAMN, am I ever glad that I did, because if I didn't, I'm pretty confident that I wouldn't be here typing this now.

So, after getting pretty fucked up off just he quarter g, I drew the rest back up into another rig and threw it in my desk drawer for later and nodded off for a couple hours. When I snapped outa my haze, I decided to go out for a walk down by the lake and enjoy the beautiful weather we were having. The whole afternoon, I was feeling pretty good and told myself that I would save the other half for the morning instead of having to hustle something up quick before work.

1AM rolls around and I'm still feeling alright, not sick though not high. So, I decide that it would probably be safe to finish my shit up now and still be good for work in the morning and not super faded. The shot was exactly the same amount, same dope and everything. The biggest difference was that I didn't get nearly as faded from this shot. In fact, I barely felt it.... Now I'm quite disappointed because I was expecting that super amazing nod that I experienced 8 or 9 hours before.

It seems that I've experienced similar scenarios in the past but have always discredited my thoughts for some reason. Tonight though, I'm positive that my dope was not nearly as strong as before. Why can this be? I looked into it briefly and found on a couple of other forums that the potency shouldn't be effected. My findings from tonight really seem to beg different though. Has this happened to anyone else here? Am I just going nuts? The only thing that I can think of is that the dope was still so good that my opiate receptors are still loaded up from the shot before and couldn't accept the new flood of opiates coming in. I know that's pretty basic answer but anyone think that could be in the right direction? I'm tired and need to get to bed. Sorry for the story but thanks for reading if you got this far.


tl;dr - Cooked up some dope around 3 PM today. Shot half right away and got super faded and nodded off. Loaded the other half, already cooked up into another rig and stored in my desk drawer for later. After about 8 or 9 hours, I slammed that saved shot from earlier and barely felt it. What gives?

Ninja edit - I'd also like to mention that this dope was from the same guy that I have been going to for the past couple of months. It's always been the same dope up until today. He never mentioned anything about it until I called him after the first shot to have him warn people. He then said it was a new batch from the city and was happy that I gave him the heads up. This is just another reminder; ALWAYS use with friends or someone around that knows what to do. Test shots are your friend and sometimes your savior, ALWAYS use a test shot. Also, Narcane is a good thing to have for anyone, just in case.... Today was a big reminder for me that things aren't always the same, even if it appears to be routine.",1402901789.0

Her favorites are opiates. She said she loved either oxycontin or oxycodone, I can't remember which. We're planning on smoking crystal meth together this Thursday, but I want to surprise her with some sort of opioid. So I tried to look online to find which one was better for recreational purposes. I found oxycontin is the time release form of oxycodone, and I'm assuming that makes it worse for recreational use, like how snorting vyvanse doesn't do anything. 

 But then I saw how a lot of people online preferred oxycontin, and now I'm confused. So which is better? And what's the best way to do it recreationally?",1402873593.0

Long story short, the guy my friend was picking 30's off of just up & left with the money. Turned off his phone, gone. I was pissed because I thought he had them already & I am not in the habit of letting my money walk. I was out $75, but my friend was out over $300.  My dude spent the night trying to track him down, driving all over & it turns out, yeah, the guy fucked him over. And this is a guy he's been using forever. 

Now this is usually the point where I accept the burn, albeit angrily. My friend got fucked too, I don't expect shit now. However, he felt bad, and he's an honest dude. He gave my bf a gram for free & gave me 10 norcos. It's not the same, but its better than nothing. And really awesome of him to make it right out of his own pocket. (And no, I don't think he himself burned me & spun this yarn. There's too much evidence to the contrary.)

2.) Inability to stay asleep.  I can crash for 15 minutes or 5 hours, but I always wake up and am always wide awake when I do.

3.) Hungry very sporadically.  I will eat voraciously for a day, then hardly eat for several.

Every month Im excited to get my script filled, gear up and bliss out.

* ~250mg high purity dope
* 1 - 8mg hydromorphone
* (possibly) 100mg cocaine

I'm not really worried about the coke because I'm probably going to add 25mg into each shot, if any. I've never speedballed before and I don't know if I should start when my tolerance is so low.

What I'm really wondering is if there are any any special methods you folks use for combo shots. I'm thinking that I won't have to heat this dope, but I've never cold cooked dope before. I've only ever done street dope.

So, if cold mix is the way to go here, I'd presumably:

1. Dose H out very carefully. I'm thinking 20-30mg for first shot since I've no tolerance.

2. Ground up a quarter of my dilly. Less? I'm really only doing this to add to that rush.

3. Set dilly powder in my cooker and add water. Wait about 5 min.

4. Add my measured dope and stir a bit.

5. Filter.

6. Draw, tie off, and shoot.

Am I doing anything wrong here? Suggestions? Dose improvements?

The help is much appreciated.

Cops pull you over, they test the suspicious flour sack, it tests ""positive"" for cocaine / heroin (after all there is *some* in there). Would they charge you with 10 pounds (however much the sack weighed) or Heroin / Cocaine? How would they delineate the charges? I've been thinking about this for weeks and it's bugging the shit out of me.

TL;DR - You're driving around town with a gigantic sack of flour, but also mixed in the  flour is a finger nail's worth of cocaine / heroin. The cops pull you over, test the flour, it comes back positive for drugs. Are you charged for the entire sack of flour's weight?",1402961291.0

I've had bad insomnia for two weeks now. I should have stopped lowering my dose last week, but ""it's only a little insomnia, I'm fine"". oh how i regret saying that. I've been feeling icky since going down this past Friday. my insomnia was getting better and then i went down again. it's a couple hours til methadone time. usually i feel okay. but i couldn't stop shitting. i went to lie down. big mistake. woke up 2 hours later. couldn't stop shitting. had to prep a hit while on the toilet. i promised myself i wouldn't use more than my p a day but i couldn't help it.

and then comes today. i wake up around noon and do my last hit. i go meet up with a friend. he hooks me up. i go see my psychologist, go downtown, the usual crap. I'm in the mall and all of a sudden i know I'm going to shit myself if i don't find a bathroom. so i tell myself okay i think its okay to do another hit. fuck, dope ain't as good as what i get. oh well. get home at 10pm do another hit. i just drank my methadone. 

two days in a row I'm doing more dope than usual and I'm stuck on the goddamn toilet for quite some time. muscles all hurting and spazzing out.

all the while i keep telling myself don't be fucking anxious and don't fuck this up for yourself you're so fucking close!!

i went from 110ml to 65ml in a month and a half. I've gone down every single week. but this week i know my limits and I'm not doing too well so I'm staying at 65ml for another week and pray to god my body stabilizes itself. they said i can be at max. 50ml to switch to suboxone. I'm almost there. ugh. i can taste the victory already. in two weeks i see my nurse to make the plans.

i want to tell you guys that you can do it. i know you're determined, just like i am, but don't push your body more than it can handle. last week all i had was a little insomnia. nothing else. thought i was fine. went down again this week and i feel horrible. I'm trying so hard. i made a promise to myself that as long as I'm not on the shitter all day i won't do any more drugs than my allotted point.

i should start feeling better today or tomorrow. i hope. i really do. ugh. i can't wait until the day that I'm no longer a slave to any opiate.

UPDATE: I felt much better today. Still felt a little shitty towards the end of the day (but not near as bad as yesterday) so I did another half point. gah. i need to stop it with the extra half p. at least i didn't spend the day pooping. that was a plus. i hope I'm back to normal tomorrow. i gotta remember to call my clinic tomorrow for that script for sleeping pills that i desperately need. thanks for all your advice :)",1403072409.0

Anyone who's seen the show knows that House has an addiction to pain killers, and his drug of choice is Vicodin.  I'm up to season 3, and in episode 6, you finally see what his scripts say.  Now, personally I'm not a big fan of Vicodin as it is (give me oxy any day!), but his script is written as ""Vicodin 5/500 2-4 tablets pog 4-6 PRN for pain.  Disp# 105 (one hundred and five) one week supply""

First of all, if he's working in a hospital and can pretty much get ANY script he wants from his friend anyway, why would he stick with hydrocodone?  He's shown he can inject himself with morphine, or he could easily get a fent patch or strong oxycodone without the APAP.  Second (this is the one that inspired this post), that is a fucking TON of APAP to take!!!  As written, we're talking 12 GRAMS of APAP for the maximum daily dose.  Alternatively, dividing 105 pills by 7 days (it did say a one week supply) is STILL 7500 mg of APAP!  There is no way anyone could take that much APAP every day and not have liver failure!

I dont weigh very much, and i would say 10mg of oxy usually puts me in a blissful sleepy state. I also usually dose high-ish when i use phenibut alone, around 2-3 grams.

They really do work great as long as you prep them right. Once cut the hard plastic shell off of the outside of the pill and cut the white part separate from the grey you just chop it up into itty bitty teeny weeny pieces with a razor blade (grinder doesn't work well with these, gotta use a razor or really sharp knife) If you have a pill crusher put small pieces in that and see if it will get them any smaller, if not, just make sure you can get it chopped up as fine as possible, the smaller and more powder like, the more even and better your pill will cook, also ending up with a slightly stronger shot than if you didn't get it fine enough. Next, add them to your spoon and cook until it changes to a light tan colour, don't overcook it or your wasting your pill, squirt 150 units in, reheat to mix up a little then squirt your other 50 units in, add your filter of choice, draw up, then shoot. If you did a good job prepping it I think it feels closer to a 12mg shot. A lot of work, but definitely better than being sick.

I always snort (never IV) and over that time period I have taken 15-20 different two week tolerance breaks (every few months basically) where I would just cold turkey quit heroin with loperamide to help. I find that in 2 weeks of total abstinence my tolerance drops by 3x and euphoria from heroin skyrockets up so it was worth the two weeks of hell every time for me.

My gear comes from the best darknetmarket sellers, so it is very good stuff and I use on average 300mg/day. I can feel just barely okay on 150mg/day.

On Monday of this week I went to an addiction clinic nearby in heavy WDs to see what help they could offer me. I am in Canada so this is free. I spent the day there, saw a doctor, they gave me 8mg suboxone, tested me for every disease (all clean) and gave me a daily 8mg subs script where I have to go to the pharmacy every fucking day to get my single dose (it also costs me $14/day for a single sub dose WTF!).

The subs made all of my physical WD symptoms go away but I am experiencing EXTREME anxiety that I have never felt before in my life. The anxiety level is worse than what I get during heavy wds. I don't know if it's wds or some kind of side effect of subs. I need 2mg of xanax every day just to survive and a benzo addiction is the absolute last thing I need right now. This is the first week taking benzos (I don't use them at all normally), but still I have to stop this real soon or I am going to be in deeper shit than I started.

Now I don't know what to do. I can stay on my subs and keep taking benzos to survive (and get addicted to xanax), I can go off subs and try to taper down using heroin myself then cold turkey it (might fail and total relapse), I can get an increased sub dose (will that help with anxiety?), I can switch to methadone (but that seems worse than heroin) or I can do something else that I have not thought of.

I am seeing my doctor on Saturday and he is actually an extremely cool guy who is genuinely willing to help me quit in any way he can. The dude even offered to prescribe me weed if I wanted, so he will prescribe me anything reasonable if I ask for it. Unfortunately weed just makes it worse for me.

So I've been dopeless and feckless for about a month now - it's a clean piss and health check if nothing else. Anyhow, my biggest issue has been the PAWS insomnia. In the past month, every now and again I would buckle like a bitch and take like .5 mg of sub after it being a few sleepless days or being in a situation where I need sleep, or convince myself I do. Anyhow - if I take a sub or something, it's not like i sleep. I don't. But I could give a fuck and I can at least enjoy being online and doing whatever while I'm awake, and then I'll get the sleep the next day. 

Essentially, I can't get comfortable enough to even chill proper during my insomnia, which I've had since I was a child and is a big part of why dope was so appealing. I'm going to lay down my cocktails and resign myself to the no sleep. I've tried everything that's not an opiate to sleep. I've gone from benzos to seroquel to dxm to fucking everything - whiskey and weed my fork and knife - no level of abuse gets me to sleep, and it's an awful sleeplessness because it makes my mind foggy and I can't even read a book or do something online.

Ideas ?,"So I started on a pain management plan for a fully torn rotator cuff injury that I am having surgery for next month. The doc does pee tests every two weeks and, of course, THC was present in my urine.  I didn't know that would be a problem as I'm also a card holder (medical mj legal) but he says he can't refill my pain med scripts next time if I have that in my system.  I really don't want to give up smoking as it helps incredibly with sleeping and I've just been dong it so long that it's just part of my normal life.  I can't bear my pain though so, forced to choose, I have to go with the opiates at least as long as I'm in pain.  

Does  anyone have an idea on how I can still smoke and pass the urine test?  The bathroom is totally private so bringing in synthetics that I have read about would seemingly be easy but then I worry the opiates won't even show up.  I assume would be bad as they would think I'm selling my meds ...  Can I get synthetic urine and add a little bit of crushed up oxy to it or is it some other form in the pee since it's run through the kidneys ?  If I do smoke do you think I can quit for 3-4 days before appts and have a negative result ?  Any ideas are welcome and thanks in advance !!

I didnt want to say fuck all pharmacists because I know theres some good ones out there. When I first started filling scripts for pain meds (after a long hospital stay about 6-8 montsh ago), it took me 2 days and 9 pharmacies before I found one that would fill my script for 4mg dilaudids 5 a day every 4-6 hours as needed. I was almost in tears and even had my mom with me, discharge paperwork, hospital bands on, and tape over when I had a PICC line. I found a great pharmacist at a big box store, who knew about crohns and has a friend who has it.

So I go in today and its not him working. I always go on Wednesdays cause i know he works then, and he just never gives me any fuss. So there an older gentleman and immediately I start getting a bad feeling. I give the script to the girl, and she says that the pharmacist has to check it out, and that hes covering for the usual guy. Im 31, and on the outside look like I work out everyday, so i understand my script looks weird. He looks at me, then the script, me, then the script. Then he says ""Im not filling this"" and turns his back on me. I politely say ""sir why cant it be filled?"" and he just says ""Im not filling that"". I say sir I have been coming here for 8 months and have never had an issue, Im a regular here and come in every few weeks with various scripts for my crohns. This time he ups his volume ""im not filling this ok"" and walks away. I goto the pick up window where he retreated and asked for his name and let him know I will be calling his higher ups. I ask when the normal guy comes back and he says friday. I told him im out of pills and withdrawals will put me in the hospital, and say thanks on the way out. I walked a lap around the store and then went back to ask the girl if he was working the whole day, of course he was. I then quickly asked him why he didnt even look in the computer and check my history with them. He sighs and then asks to look at the script while simultaneously saying ""our computer says our inventory is out"", when he never touched the computer. I tell him that the regular pharmacists knows me so well that its already ordered and put on the side for me EVERY TWO WEEKS. After staring at the script for 15 minutes and tapping on the computer he says ""hey man it will just be 20 minutes!""

I am just completely and utterly baffled by this. I don't understand how a pharmacists has the power to look at me then my script and decide that I don't need what was written because he is protecting his own ass? I get that part but he didnt even check me out in the computer first. I feel really really bad for people who are younger and might have cancer or other serious illness's and get treated like this. If you have a legit script with all the right legal info, they should HAVE to fill it. I just dont get it.

Ultimately me sticking up for myself got me my script, but with what i have stress in no bueno at all. I cant even explain how frustrated I was when he was like ""im not filling that"" over and over.

Im sure that some of these people are properly remembered by friends and family but for a lot of us, this community is like a surrogate family because we've been disowned by the people we love in the real world. 

Especially in the case of an OD, I figure these people that *we* know for their humor and compassion, either just vanish because they have no one, or are hated for throwing their lives away.

I think that we should hold a virtual ""service"" (just sharing memories and whatnot) for our friend and all pitch-in for some sort of memorial. I was thinking of a tree with a plaque, so that there is *something* good left behind in their name.

We can work out the practicalities, but I figure we would give whatever we can to Tracey (if she can do this, she may be too busy) which should be enough for the tree and a small donation, in the name of the member, to Tracey's harm reduction efforts.

I always feel it really hard when I read about an OD on here because we're all so helpless to do anything at all, but this would at least give us a way to show that we cared and they mattered to us.

Back story: I have been on oxycodone 30mg for many years now as a result of deciding to try out perc 5's with my best friend in high school (2006). Shit escalated within a few years. I was taking up to 6-8 30s per day for several months at my worst (not as bad as it could have been, but bye-bye student loan refunds!) and decided it was time to quit.

I was clean for about a month, except for one day I took one roxy 30 in the middle of the month. I felt pretty good about my sobriety break, because it gave my tolerance a chance to decrease. 

Incident: A little over a week ago I was robbed, which sucked. I was moderately upset for a little while but figured I guess he needed the money more than me, whatever. I chalk it up to the game, and I happened to lose this round.

On my way home, tail tucked, I must have run over a bolt; my tire blew on the interstate 30 miles from home. I had a spare and a jack for my car, but no wrench to take the bolts off my tire. My poor friend was hero enough to come down and rescue me. In my attempt to save gasoline I turned off the car while I waited, and my battery died. Thankfully he also had jumper cables and it all ended up okay, but all in all it was a pretty crappy night.

However, the night took a turn for the better when I took a chance and messaged my old 30s guy to say hello because I was in his area and thought of him. Turns out he was still around after months of us not communicating. He is the best dude I have ever had. Always, ALWAYS on time, often gave me free shit to go along with my 30s, or gave me an extra for free if I bought more than ten at once, was generally very gentlemanly and polite, and he often gave me snacks or a juice box for my ride home. My favorite one was when he gave me one of those blue ""Hugs"" barrel juice thingies, which I hadn't had since maybe third or fourth grade.

Met up with him later that week, and everything went great. I was grateful. I realized today that I have been buying from him for just about four years now, and that's a pretty long business relationship for people like us. Right now I'm nodding away after only half of one 30 and 500 mcg of xanax, after taking one whole 30 at 7pm before working out for an hour and a half. I am having such a great day and wanted to share it with all of you! How fantastic is it when your tolerance goes down dramatically?!

I don't know if I'm expecting any responses, but I hope you all are having as nodtastic a day as I am having. Your posts have gotten me through some very tough times, so thank you.

TL;DR: Was robbed, flat tire and dead car battery same night. Met up with my old (FAVORITE) guy and am having a GREAT night. Er... morning. Love you all!",1403246964.0
28mefu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/28mefu/need_to_detox_from_opiates_afraid_of_the/,14,https://redd.it/28mefu,gage69,Need to detox from opiates? Afraid of the withdrawals or using dangerous & addictive drugs like Methadone and Suboxone? I have the answer! [x-post from /poppytea],"Opiates are fun but it's nice to take a break from them once in a while. Being a slave to opiates is no joke. It can ruin family, friends, jobs etc. After getting clean from opiates I recommend getting in a support group of some kind depending on how long you've been using. If you wish to go back to doing opiates, go for it! And know you'll have this secret trick up your sleeve if you ever want to start using again.

So what is this mystery cure? Ketamine. That's all they use in the UK to get people off opiates. It's super safe, doesn't lower heart rate and is non addictive. Ketamine can become mentally addictive if used for months and month in a row, just like how milk can become addictive, or Cheetos. With Ketamine be smart when using it and I guarantee you'll have NO problems. Follow the directions below and you'll be A-OK. Stray from the path below and it's on you. I've personally detoxed using this method three times and have helped over 400 get off opiates. Methadone and Suboxone are addictive dangerous drugs. Ketamine is NOT.

Ketamine hits the same receptors as opiates, so there is no withdrawals, zero. Oh, you will shit a lot, but that's good, just all the toxins from the opiates that were built up leaving your body.

So, for the 24-72 hour opiate withdrawal hell period, you need to get your hands on about 4-5 vials of Ketamine or roughly 4-5 grams of powder. Check out /r/darkmarkets to buy your supplies because along with the Ketamine, you'll also need a 10 pack of syringes. The ones used for Diabetes is fine and you will need Valium/Ambien or some sort of anxiety/sleep aid. It's not super important but helps because it is nice to get as much sleep as possible during all of this.

    Get our supplies together. What I mentioned above.
    Plenty of water, gallons, can never get too much. This will dehydrate you and with the drugs and Ketamine, you don't want to mess up your kidneys.
    Food. You won't feel sick or nausea with this detox method, but comfort food and soup is always nice to have on hand.
    A room with a bed, cable, computer and internet is the way to go. Somewhere to lock yourself off from the world for 3 or 4 days where you won't be disturbed.
    Take a shower, be as clean as possible because you're going to be shitting a lot and spending a lot of time in the bathroom, which leads me to number 5
    Get your room clean. Get your bathroom clean. Use bleach and alcohol. Actually use alcohol a lot for the syringes and everything else too, such as the surfaces of your buttox where you will be making the hourly injections. If you're doing everything right, your room & bathroom should smell like a hospital.

This is where you have to step up and become the doctor, it's easy though.

Once the cravings from the opiates come on, and ONLY when this happens is when you begin the Ketamine regiments. Wait as long as possible until it's unbearable. Seriously. Mixing Ketamine while you're high on opiates will make you violently ill. I know someone who died from this. But, once the tears start coming on, your muscles start cramping and you feel like you need to release your bowels, you're good to go. So lets begin!

In my personal experience and what I share with others is to begin by taking 1/20th of a vial as needed. Once the Ketamine wears off in about 1-3 hours and you begin feeling any withdrawal symptoms again, do another shot. Try to stay around shots of 1/20th of a vial. I was doing 1/10th of a vial and things can start to get pretty weird from the drug since Ketamine is a dissociative drug. Though come day 2 or 3 of Hell, your tolerance will build and you'll probably be using 1/10th of a vial every shot.

Be safe. Basically, just do injections of Ketamine every time you start feeling withdrawal symptoms.

Use your butt cheeks to inject the Ketamine IM. No need for IV and snorting Ketamine powder for 4 days straight, fuck that ha

When injecting Ketamine, always clean your surface first and have plenty of rubbing alcohol to clean the needles and keep them sanitary.

Important: When IM'ing in your buttox, stay below a line. Body builders who inject steroids use this line, it's like an 'X' on each cheap. Basically, stay low on your butt and you won't have any problems. If you go higher up on your butt, you risk hitting a nerve (I forget the name). But trust me, you do not want to hit this. It immediately swells up and you can't sit on it or apply any pressure to it for 3 weeks or so. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I can't even imagine this happening while detoxing.

Continue doing this, until you have no more opiate withdrawals. And then, you're done, you're sober! You'll have no desire to do drugs again, well, at least for a while ha Stay sober as long as you want, then do opiates again if you want and then detox with Ketamine.

And I always get questions that pertain to what opiate withdrawals ketamine stops.

""Will I still have stomach pains?""

""NO - You will have no withdrawals""

""What about sweating? Will I still sweat?""

""NO - You will have no withdrawals""

""I'm a heavy user, like 300mg oxies a day, will I have withdrawals?""

""NO - You will have no withdrawals""

""What about nausea and loss of appetite""

""NO GODDAMNIT! YOU'RE BODY STILL THINKS YOU'RE HIGH ON OPIATES SO IT'S NOT EVEN FUCKING POSSIBLE TO HAVE WITHDRAWALS.""

Best of luck! Please share this with someone you know who wants to take a break from opiates.

It finally stuck and I was sober for 13 months. In that 3 year period regardless of the relapsing my health significantly improved, I rebuilt my relationships, and found a new, more fulfilling career. Just to preface all of this I was not a unproductive junkie prior to all of this either. I graduated from NYU with a double major, followed by 60+ hour work weeks at a well established ad firm... 
Now, bringing it to present day, I've been chipping for the past 12 months and I've actually been pretty successful. I typically use 2 days out of the week and am only getting about a gram of tar at a time. I have some rules that I try to keep in place which keep me relatively in check. Here they are and if you're a chipper I would love to hear yours.

1. I can only use Thursday - Saturday: If I have any left over I either have to sell it or flush it. This has happened a couple times and while it's a pain in the ass I know myself well enough that if I have it I'm not going to be able to not use it. 
2. No cocaine or using potentiators: I know this might sound crazy but I do have some semblance of self control when I'm just using the tar but if you throw some coke in the mix and don't give 2 shits about anything anymore. 
3. No getting high after 330am: If I mess up my sleep patterns it makes everything a lot harder to get back on track after my couple days and while I'm not detoxing at all after the 2 days when I can't get to sleep Sunday night I will start craving. 
4. No re-ups: If I use up whatever I get on Thursday by Friday I can't go get more for Saturday. This is more so I don't get into the habit and so I don't rush through what I have. 
5. If anyone ever realizes what I'm doing I stop for 6 months: While this hasn't happened yet if someone realizes I'm getting high then I'm probably not in control anymore.  
6. Getting high is not a treatment for my depression: I'm using to relax and have a nice time. NOT to treat my depression. A couple of times I've had to skip a couple of weeks because I was feeling depressed and when I start using the dope as medication it's game over.

I know it might seem a little crazy to have all these rules but I've decided if I want to keep getting high I can't use with impunity anymore. I'm in my late 20's with a mortgage, friends, and other equally important things. I know it's a slippery slope and I'm going to probably either get strung out again or have to stop for good, but for now if it aint broke dont fix it.

Using a throw away because i've said this before and failed but this time so help me god if I don't get off this shit i'll go crazy. Once upon a time getting high was fun and occasional and I still had friends, a girlfriend, was in school, etc. All of that reversed and I STILL didn't change. What is it gonna take? I'm 22 and my emotional health is fucked.  
I see doctors and therapists almost every week. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have a terrible relationship with my parents (they don't know the extent of my drug problem), I'm not in school, and life is just as a standstill. I have to stop. My life is under the microscope because my parents want to know whats wrong so I can get better, the doctors want to know the root cause for my illnesses.  
And at the end of the day it's dope. It's dope that runs my wallet empty and has me down and tired and withdrawing and too fucked up to be in a relationship. Well, it's not the dope. it's me. I know some people never have issues with it.  
This is not the life I want and i'm writing this because I plan on changing that, for good this time. I have 21 days clean besides taking one free hit 3 days ago which sent me far back into depression. From one hit. I think my body as well as my mind are done with the chemical happiness.  
Life is pain. It truly is. I must resign from r/opiates, permanently. I read these stories every day because it makes me feel normal, or not so addicted. This is a great community, but I can no longer be apart of it. Everyone is different and I am just sensitive. too sensitive to be fucking around with the most powerful drug there is.

A note - I know I haven't made the best of decisions today but I really don't need to be told how stupid I am, I need help and advice.

Long story short, my friend and I have been flipping small amounts of dope (no, I will not hook you up, don't fucking ask me, I don't want this to get deleted for sourcing) to support our habit. We met up today with someone new we met off an internet forum. (*Strike One*) I didn't have the best feeling about it, but they'd been a member for four years and even though they only had one post, I figured no LEO would sit around for four year with an account, waiting til now to go after someone. (*Strike Two*).

We arranged a meeting spot, my partner and I headed over there and, lo and behold, a fucking COP is sitting in the parking lot in a mostly unmarked vehicle. It was obviously a cop from a distance, and once you got closer it had ""police interceptor"" written on the back. We literally drove right behind it, saw it, and bailed hard. We got a safe distance away and then texted the guy and told him to fuck off, we saw the cop, and no way were we meeting him. He pleaded with us that he'd driven an hour to our side of town, he wasn't a LEO, it was just bad timing/luck that a cop happened to be there, blah blah blah. 

1. Question - would he have brought a cop in a car like [this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/59928955@N06/6004013562/) and [this](http://www.cmautowerkz.com/inventory/2004_cv_0202/sc2.jpg) (it looks pretty obviously like a cop to me, even from a distance) right into the small parking lot in which he was meeting us? It seems too obvious...

We fuck around a bit, trying to decide what to do, and decide to give the guy one more chance (*Strike Three*). We arrange to meet him in a different parking lot. Leave the dope in a hiding spot so it won't be on our persons when we meet up with him, meet him, grab the money, explain the where the dope is, and book it the fuck out of there. The thing is, we were in my car, and he probably got my plates, and my plates are registered to my apartment. And now, his account on the forum is deleted. Today, of all days, his four year old account is suddenly deleted, after our close call with the cops. I'm freaked out. And he won't answer my texts and I'm afraid to call because...well, I don't know why I'm afraid to call but I am. I'm gonna call him tomorrow morning though that's for sure (it's after midnight here and even though I'm panicking I'm considerate to a fault and if he IS legit I'd hate to wake him up right? :/ ).

2. Question two - is the evidence from our conversation/interaction enough for a search warrant?

3. Question three - should I be frantically cleaning the fuck out of my apartment right now in preparation for a search warrant?

Again. I know I fucked up. I'm never meeting this guy again, his number is already blocked. But I just don't know what the fuck to do. Should I be cleaning the drugs/paraphernalia out of my apartment right now and preparing for the worst??? :( Please help. I have no idea what to do.

**TL;DR Met a person off an internet forum to sell some dope, went to meet him and a fucking mostly unmarked COP CAR is in the parking lot. My partner and I bail, but he manages to convince us to meet him somewhere else. We hide the dope in the parking lot so it won't be on our person when we see him, meet up with him and explain the deal and take his money, then book it when we tell him where to find the dope and he goes off to get it. He probably got my plates though and my car is registered to my apartment. Was he really a LEO and should I be cleaning my apartment in preparation for a warrant?? I'm getting more paranoid and panicked by the moment. Please help :(**",1403328925.0

I've had my moments of ""sobriety"" (my definition of sobriety is smoking weed drinking and taking xanax lol). Well I've been ""sober"" for about three months now. No xanax. Just weed, drinking and the occasional adderall. I had moved away from the city a few hours north where I can't find anything. Well, I visited the city about a month after getting sober.... I tried a pack. I know enough to just sniff a little (i don't IV). Before I quit I could easily snort a $20 and get pretty high and possibly want another pack. Well this time I snorted about a fourth of my $20. I ended up getting sick as fuck,throwing up all night. Almost like the first time I did dope. I ended up getting frustrated with myself and threw the rest away. Then a few weeks ago, I got a hold of another $20 pack. I did the same thing, tried to take a little less this time. Same thing happened, puking all night and ended up throwing the rest away. 

Now I've had longer periods of sobriety in the past and was able to start off doing about $10 pack and not get sick...

Why is this happening? Am I allergic to dope now?! lol Or is it just too strong?

I am about to start MMT and just have a question....

I'm thinking of being good until I get my take homes and then balancing MMT and preserving my ability to shoot maybe once a week or something on the side.  

I understand that if I'm on a dose higher than like 70mgs daily, that I can forget about being able to get high, but once I have take homes, I'll be able to regulate that a little bit more.  

For those of you on MMT, have you given up on trying to get high or have you been able to dance that dance?

Also, side note, I have never tried the methadone....  Will my cravings truly go away and what is the high like?  For those with social issues, will it help with being more social and energized?  ",1403285716.0

I got the bundle and the bags were fat but the dope was pretty weak. I did the whole bundle in 2 hours and only got a little high. I call him on my lunch break to see if hes got something different. He says hes got some new shit he wants me to test. When i tell him about the poor bundle i got earlier, he at first was like what? She should have given u the scarface bags(i got blank white ones) and he seemed confused. I told him she told me that she had to make the bags up. He was like oh shit, she must have made up this dope(the shit he wanted me to try) with cut on it. He pulls out this huge bag of slabs of dope, and said it was an oz. Hes like this shit is okay, but it cant hold any cut. He picks out a big ass chunk, probably arpund a G and is like here, yoy can have this. Then he pulls out the scarfaces and was like this is the misile she was supposed to sell you. And he gave me. 2 of those and i bought another bundle of the scarfaces. Ive been going through this dude since 06 and he has always been super straight. I dont understand why more dealers cant be like this. He has probably 10 upper middle class - rich white people who have been clients for years and we all stay pretty loyal to him. Plus all the other people who come and go. So many more dealers could make more money just by doing right by their clients. Oh yeah and he also gave me a couple straw bumps of the fire raw he had in the scarfaces. Anyway i love just cjilling with the dude cause he gets high too and is always super generous with the raw when we hang. Of course over 8 years theres been some batches that werent great but on multiple occasions he has let me trade the weak dope back for something better if he told me it was fire and turned out not to be.

Another thing i like about him is that despite the fact hes a big thugged out black dude im not afraid to argue or stand up to him if i dont think somethings right. It doesnt happen often(its been 8 years so theres bound to be sime disagreement), but sometimes well get in a argument about where to meet or rarely the quality. You actually get more respect and better service if you stand up to him.

So I am at my parents house for the next week (I've already been here a week). One of my parents recently passed away, so I'm helping the other parent take care of business. My parents are former nurses and the deceased parent had a lot of medical issues and pain.

So of course the junkie in me overtook the grieving child and I started looking around for ""leftover"" meds. I reasoned that they were just going to go in the trash, so taking them wasn't directly hurting anyone. Now I guess I should say that I didn't bring nearly enough dope to deal with all the emotional wreckage I've been dealing with...losing a parent SUCKS. Also, the family does not know about my usage.

So I scoured the house and only came up with a small bottle of Norcos. A few days later I was cleaning a top shelf and my hand brushed against a pill bottle...wait, what?? My heart rate sped up, my mouth started to water and I got all tingly. If it was on the top shelf, it is probably something good!!! 

Pull the bottle down and almost faint from excitement when I see that the scrip starts with oxy and there are like 60 or more of them. I pull out my phone, use the pill checker and.....

Oxybutynin... is used to treat overactive bladder (a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause frequent urination.

Sigh...so I crushed a few and banged that shit so hard!!!! Oxy is oxy...right? Plus I don't REALLY need to pee, right?

Not really...
I wondered why Junkie Jesus had forsaken me and I actually raised my fists to the sky and silently cursed my other parent for throwing away all of the good meds (fent patches!! Pills galore!!!) before I got there.

I am in an area where cold copping isn't even remote possible. Way too risky and forreal forreal dangerous. So Imma stretch out those Norcos and ride it out. The Junkie in me wants to call the pharmacy and see if I can get some of the meds refilled. But I'm not going to...really. I'm not.

So I know I'm not a frequent poster in this sub but through the lives of several accounts I have learned so much about opiate use, myself, and humanity in general by lurking. You are all incredibly interesting people and I can only hope to run into one or two of you in the future to swap a few stories.

 After getting into Roxi's and percs occassionaly, I figured my use wouldn't increase at all. I have been snorting H all day every day for a 4 month period and I thought no one would notice.  I always told myself if someone noticed and asked me what was up, that would be that.  I was snorting almost 2 buns a day and was dipping into my savings wayyyyy too much.  and for a 20 yo guy going to a private college, I really can't afford to give all my money away for the best feeling the world has to offer.

On Monday I went over to my close friends house to watch the world cup game around noon and was half nodding on his couch without intent while his parents were there.  Him and a few other close friends ended up talking to me saying I wasn't being the normal dabbersupya that they know and that they could tell I was having some sort of drug problem.  I have come clean to 3 of my 4 best friends so far, and boy does it feel good.  Knowing someone close to you knows what you're going through can really be a big help.  I have been clean since tuesday now and I have gotten over the worst of the withdrawals using lope and benzo's to sleep occasionally.

Now that I have been clean and my friends have made it clear they have my back and don't think any less of me for it, I feel sooooo much better about my habit.  No one knew besides one redditor who ended up completely cutting off communication with me, and I was feeling hopeless. My friends telling me how much they care about me and how I need to go back to the old me really hit home.

That's when I realized...... the best feeling the world has to offer isn't heroine. I'ts realizing you have overcome the drug that has taken so many lives and caused so much grief among people who love each other.  June 16th is the day I can remember that I finally took a step back from the cliff I was about to plummet off of.

- use new syringes 
- use clean surfaces used for prep
- use sterile water 
- do not use things like spit, Gatorade, soda to inject
- do not share equipment 
- stay hydrated 
- do not overuse antibiotics. It will make treatment much more complicated 
- do not trust other people to do a sterile prep. Either do your own or watch each step. 

If you have no access to sterile supplies, at MINIMUM clean your injection sites before and after and get clean water. It makes a huge difference . 

I hear people say on here- well I have shot up a zillion times and never had an abscess. Well, it is like an OD. Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it won't and if it does it is life threatening.

Okay my favorite community, the time has come that I ask for all your opinions, experiences, and thoughts. 

First, a little background information, I've been hooked for nearly three years. I didn't start off with hydros and bullshit like that, went from roxis, to dope, to dilaudid, the occasional fent, OPs, opana, etc. But really, I just love the fuck out of my dope. During those three years, I have had MAYBE two months worth of days clean all together. I've gone to detox, came out worse than when I went in. I've tried the sub doc, stopped after a week because I wanted to continue to get high. I've tried cutting back, to no avail. I've tried cold turkey, and wanted to kill myself. I've tried alot of things basically, none of which worked. 

Before I started doing opiates, I was doing well in college. Drinking and smoking pot all the time, but never affected my school work. Deans list, was supposed to graduate early, extremely good internship for my dad's company that paid super well. Opiates destroyed all that. I got into opiates with my boyfriend, who I've been on again off again with for the past 4 years. We've put each other through hell, we've fueled each others addictions and made them worse, we've enabled each other, all the things couples in addictive, destructive relationships do. But, despite anything and everything, he's my forever boy. There's some people that just know when they've met that person that they'll be with for the rest of their lives. At 22, I know I've found my person. Nothing will change my mind about that. He is the only person that I can always count on, that will (almost) always put me even before himself, and who loves me unconditionally despite all my fuck ups and all the fights we've had. 

Now, to the hard shit. These drugs are destroying my life. Dope has taken everything from me. I have no relationship with anyone in my family, all my friends have abandoned me until I can 'get my shit together' (understandably), I can't get a new job with my dirty piss and because of how unstable I am. I'm living from high to high, doing my best to escape the sickness of withdrawals. I'm tired, I'm beaten down, I'm ashamed of myself and what I've become, I'm lonely, and I'm afraid. But at the same time, I fucking love heroin. I love making life's bullshit fade away as soon as the plunger goes down. The final verdict though is I'm at a point that I'm either going to end up in jail, an institution, or dead. Simple as that. I no longer trust myself to have control over my own life or to make rational decisions for myself. 

So that's where you guys come in. I have a lot of choices on what I can do to stop this shit and get out while I hopefully still can. I would love to hear everyone's personal experiences with each option I have and how successful the choices made were. I'm also going to include my experiences with each, so maybe you guys can help me decide what the best option for me is. So here we go. 

1) Cold turkey: I don't really think I have to even say this, but fuck cold turkey. I always tell myself that if I go through the suffering of cold turkey, I'm less likely to relapse because of the hell that cold turkey entails. This typically isn't the case. I usually last a week or two, max, then I'm right back where I started off. 

2) inpatient detox program: I recently completed such a program, and it was hell on earth. I don't really even consider myself clean during my stay, because I was so fucked up on so many meds along 24mgs of subutex a day and my prescribed klonopin. I met a very bad character in rehab, who I then became 'friends' with outside of the center when we were released on the same day. He introduced me to dilaudid, gave me multiple k8s a day (which I had never tried previously, trust me when I say I fell in love). He also introduced me to some fantastic cocaine, which I became slightly hooked on for a few weeks as well. Speedballs and all that good stuff. I was so much worse off for the three weeks after I got out than I had ever been before. I am very, very lucky to be alive. This leads me to be wary towards short-term detox programs. 

3) suboxone maintenance: I got on suboxone shortly after my horrible few weeks after detox. My parents footed the bill (as they have with everything recovery wise, all they want in the world is for their daughter to get better and money isn't an issue for them). I lasted about a week, someone stole my entire script, and I went back to dope. Now, if I go with this option, it won't be through a doctor. My boyfriend is getting on suboxone tomorrow, and because the things are always way over prescribed, he will be dosing me with some of the extras he gets. 

4) naltrexone: yes, the pill that prevents you from being high. I don't know much about it and I'm very curious to hear others experiences with it. 

5) vivitrol shot: the goddamn vivitrol shot. I've sworn so many times I would NEVER get the vivitrol shot. But things are getting bad enough that it's a possibility. I just want to hear others problems/experience with it. 

6) long term treatment: and finally, my last option, long term treatment. I'm 99% against it. I'm not cool with leaving the town I've lived in my entire life to somewhere that I know no one. My parents want me to go to a place called Marr in Atlanta. There's a very slim chance that's gonna happen. 

So, those are my options. Please give me feedback on the methods you've tried/recommendations. I appreciate it greatly!

I have lots of fun and terrifying stories, mostly relating to driving from stroudsburg to east orange and back twice a week.

im not sure if looking at dope porn every day is very healthy for me, but it definitely fills part of the void.  i might never post again but i just wanna say thanks for your pics and stories.  its helpful to me to be reminded of how insane this lifestyle can be and i hope you can stay safe

I'm about to get on a plane for a cross-country flight, and my usual roxy hookup could not come through, so I'm gonna be flying with a few tramadols and one 30mg roxy to hold me for 2 days. ARGH.

For some fucked up reason, the last few days my withdrawals have been really uncomfortable. Usually a tramadol will keep me happy and good for 7-8 hours, but this time they did nothing. When things got unbearable I'd take a 1/4 roxy (7.5 mg) and feel perfect, but only for 4 hours. I don't have enough roxy to last me through Wednesday late afternoon at this rate. Even kratom doesn't feel like it's helping. I don't know why my usual remedies aren't doing the job, but I need to be on my A-game tomorrow (wed) because I'm giving a huge presentation all afternoon.

ANYWAY, I have a few 8mg suboxone strips that I cut into 1mg pieces. I've never tried it before, and I'm a little worried trying it before I hop on a cross-country flight, and before one of the highest-stakes presentations I've done tomorrow. I can't be loopy or derpy, but I can't have the cold-sweats and skin-crawlies of WDs either.

So... I've got 4 50mg tramadols, 1.5 roxies (45 mg total), and about 5  8mg suboxone strips cut into 1mg strips. I've got a fresh Xanax scrip, too. Oh, I also have a full bottle of lope, but that never did anything for me. My usual roxy habit is between 90-150/a day for 2 years now.

What would you do to stay comfy?  Also: I only take stuff orally... no snorting or injecting or anything.

TL,DR: Need suggestions on how to stay comfortable and awesome during a high-pressure work thing, when my usual WD remedies aren't working so great.

*EDIT:* Praise Junky Jesus! My bf hurt his knee a few days ago (not bad at all) and had a doc appointment this morning, and he got a scrip for percosets without even asking. So... WD issue handled. Thanks for everyone's input! xo",1403617331.0

Well I still am able to get meds but really want more clean days then chipper days, well anyways i pick up 10 80mg Ops and took 3 of them on Friday and it was Great for the First few hours then it became a task of being high and sick throwing up(smoke is ciggs), Fun But sucks every time i went to smoke.  anything I drank or ate after I smoked I have to Throw up. Fyi before Friday i was 2 and half week clean got high 2 days and was clean another 2 weeks before that so i had 28 days clean and 2 days high before this weekend.  Well on Sat i was thinking it will be a little better but samething, had a Blast for the first few hours then sick and high the rest of the night. So Today i take 3 one last time and got really sick but this time my Vision got really blurry and head was spinning, like all most about to faint type shit.  It was scary.  I was thinking next time i should go down and just get Percs or 15mg roxy.  This shit was a task and a little scary.   Being clean is great though and what is crazy is my Clean days are funner and better then my high days.  I think this may be a sign, but i still wanna keep my script.

28y4ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/28y4ud/on_suboxone_for_6_years_tapered_off_relapsed/,9,https://redd.it/28y4ud,digispin,"On Suboxone for 6 years, tapered off, relapsed.","This has been on my mind for a while because I've never read any post related to being on Suboxone for such a long time. In 2009 I was taking an 80 mg Oxy and chewing it up and loving it about once a day. To me this was clearly unsustainable and a friend told me about Suboxone. I found a local doctor and started treatment with 1 8mg tablet per day. It was a bit rough at first but I got acclimated. Slowly over time, I reduced to 6 mg, and then to 4 mg about the time the films came out. My doctor was great as I essentially chose when to go down to the lower dose. There was a little nudging on his part but I always felt in control. So over the years I continue to reduce the dose. Now at 2 mg I probably stayed on the longest simply because of the 2 mg strip. Then I went to 1 mg and then 0.5 mg.
Two months ago I decided it was time to taper to zero. My doctor prescribed me a few meds to help with the detox: clonidine, phenobarbital, Seroquel, and naltrexone (not needed). I cut my remaining Suboxone strips down to the smallest manageable size (about 1/8""). Once I finished those I started the detox regimen. Just as my doctor predicted, the third day was the hardest, with the shits and whatnot. It wasn't that bad really, nothing like when I was doing the Oxys and dealt with withdraws for a week or whatever. My Doctor said my gradual tapering helped the detox greatly. I felt very confidant in myself because all my old sources for Oxy where in jail, dead, moved, who knows what.
A month and a half go by and I'm not craving but I'm somewhat depressed, having sleeping problems, and a huge lack of initiative and interests. My doctor described this as post-withdrawal syndrome. In coordination with my psychiatrist, I went on Celexa.
I wanted to feel better/normal. I considered asking my doctor about going back onto Suboxone but that didn't make sense to me. Not surprising to myself, with my ingenuity and determination, I discovered Silk Road somehow. After a few hoops and whatnot, I had some Oxys in my possession. I relapsed of course. (Amazing after 6 years how my mind remembered and reacted to the mere taste of the crushed pill).
Soon after, I go back to my Suboxone doctor and shamefully tell him the bad news. Doctor gave the me two options, start taking the naltrexone or go back on Suboxone. I chose low dose Suboxone. I started at 1 mg then a month later went to 0.5 mg. This is where I am today. Feeling fine and happy I'm not wanting Oxys.
Sorry this post became very long but the TLDR version is: How long can one reasonably and medically appropriately take Suboxone? I can seriously see myself taking a tiny dose ~0.25 mg for the next 10 years or forever.
There could be a better time in my life to do the taper off and detox. Perhaps while stabilized on Citalopram for 6 months or longer. It certainly would be nice to stop taking Suboxone and going to my doctor every so often for a refill.
Six years on Suboxone sounds crazy, but I've been living a healthy productive life.

 I posted the other day in /r/darknetmarkets about how i was late getting to the post office saturday and couldn't pick up my package from the darknet til today. I was mad that the PO people were rude to me and i was mad i was 15 minutes late. Well, fucking Junkie Jesus was looking out for me. If i would have gotten my package Saturday, i would have went balls deep into shooting heroin. Bummed, i waited til today so i could pick up my package on the way to class and get high before class.

   I wake up this morning to my suboxone clinic calling me. ""oh, they need me to reschedule for some reason. Fuck it, i'll call them back when i wake up. I have another hour til i have to wake up for work."" Well, i wake up and listen to my voicemail. FUCK MY ASSHOLE WITH A PINEAPPLE. They need me to come in today within a 4 hour window with my suboxone films and my urine. Film count and UA. First of all, fuck. I have begun tapering myself. My contract doesn't say anything about ever having me do this, or that they can do it and only give me 4 hours. If i don't show up, i'm out of the program. Well, i have work and can't miss today. I can't show up by their time. I also need to make sure my count is what it is supposed to be by their account since i'm tapering. An hour on a calendar with all of my prescription labels (i keep them all), and i finally have it all done correctly, and a callendar for them to base it off of if they tell me i'm wrong. Turns out i'm supposed to have 93 of them total. I had 117. whoops, lol!

  Long story short, i get them to give me up until an hour after my shift ends. I get there, piss, they count etc and i'm good. IF i had gotten that package Saturday, i would be fucked right now. I fucking love my PO and the fact they wouldn't/couldn't help me out that day. Just needed to share my lucky day! Not looking for anyone to tell me not to use while I'm in a suboxone program. Don't fucking post telling me I'm a bad person etc. I don't care about your opinion. I don't do it often. Hope everyone's having as good of a day as I am!

Benzine, however, sounds like a terrible and dangerous cutting agent.

My dealer is an idiot and doesn't understand the first thing about pharmacology or chemistry, so I was hoping some of you may have some light to shed on the matter. Any experience, stories, knowledge, insight, ect, would be greatly appreciated.

On top of that I dabble in loads of heroin from time to time (smoked) and also copious amounts of poppy tea 3 times a day. So needless today my withdrawals were going to be pretty bad. They started last Thursday, Friday was the worst day of my life, I nearly tried to kill myself. Search on internet for some help and I discovered that gabapentin can be used to treat opiate withdrawals. I have nerve pain so I had a shit load of gabapentin prescribed to me that months ago I just stopped taking. MY GOD, gabapentin got rid of almost all of my withdrawal symptoms, but only if I took 1200 milligrams (4 pills). I couldn't believe how well it worked. and on top of all that, it makes you super tired so I slept like a baby. I got through to yesterday (Monday) doing absolutely no opiates. It was great.  
  
But like always I relapsed yesterday, however I only took 20 milligrams of hydro and that got me fucked. I couldn't believe that only 4 Vicodin could do that to me. It had been years since that happened. I may have relapsed yesterday and a bit today, but it is a huge step forward from where I was and I am proud of coming only this far. There is quite a ways to go.  
  
tl;dr: Gabapentin gets rid of all of your WD symptoms, but only at 1200 mgs plus. GET SOME. It WILL help you if you need it. ",1403660710.0

I need help on how to deal with it.,"I posted this to /r/drugs but someone reccomend I post it here. Any help is greatly appreciated.

I'm a fairly regular reader/poster here, and enjoy psychedelics, weed and other drugs every month or two. But I've always steered well clear of opiates. To give some background, my Dad isn't the smartest man. I had an interesting upbringing with a Mum who's a flat out psychopath, and my Dad who means well and has a heart of gold, but really isn't too smart. I've lived with my dad since my early teens and helped him with all sorts of stuff, he can't even read or write particularly well. He was very very ill as a child and spent little time in school.
About a year ago he contracted stage 3 cancer in his bladder and ended up having it removed. Things not being helped by the fact he is somewhat of an alcoholic, or used to be, hes cut down a lot since the surgery. He almost died but made a fantastic recovery and now lives a pretty normal life. But he was prescribed lots of codeine first, around 60mg a day, then liquid morphine, no idea of the dose. And now about 60mg of extended release morphine a day.
Thing is he's been taking more and hes been treated terribly the doctors, never seeing the same one twice. So he just phones up and says hes out and he gets more. I don't really know how much he is taking at the moment but I think it's 3-4 sometimes 5 30mg extended release morphine pills a day. Him not knowing about my knowledge of drugs, I kept a nervous watchful eye on how much he was taking, but it seems out of control.
It is clearly affecting his cognition, hes just a zombie, he cant hold down a job. Passes out randomly when he takes too much. Or when he dosen't take enough he turns into an absolute arsehole, which is most unlike him. I'm not being nasty, he isn't terribly smart. I've tried talking to him about it but he won't have any of it. He simply dosen't believe there's anything wrong with taking what the doctors give him. And without a single solid doctor I have no one to go to for confirmation he is taking too much and should consider tapering.
He is some pain, but he made an amazing recovcery from the surgery. And he isn't about to drop dead soon, by natural causes anyway. I don't think he needs these opiates and I know he dosen't even realise he is addicted to them. Not that he will admit anyway. They are slowly turning him into a monster, and with me recently finding him asleep knocked out at weird hours of the day I'm getting really really worried.
I'm 19, and live with my Dad and my younger brother. I do a lot of stuff he should be doing, and have been a parent to my little brother since I was a young teenager. What do I do. I'm scared to death he's going to OD as I know he will just get whatever he asks for. I'm in the UK if that helps. Sorry for the wall of text.",1403639410.0

Call my guy on the way and he says it's all good and to come through.  Well I get out to the hood where I cop and he doesn't answer the phone.  So I drive down his street to see if he's out on the block or anything, nope. So I roll down the alley to see if he's back serving someone already, nope.  So as I'm rolling out of the alley some homeless guy on the sidewalk yells at us asking for a cigarette, I said not to stop, but my driver is a nice guy and pulls over to the wrong side of the road to give this guy a cigarette.  Well as he's pulling a ciggy out to give this guy, the guy just walks off.  My driver is like don't you want the cig? And the guy yells back look behind you! So I turn and look back and there's a cop behind us with his lights on, OH SHIT.  I have rigs and a spoon on me, the driver has a suspended license, we're 2 white boys in the straight hood 50 feet from the dope spot. So real quick I try to stick my rigs and spoon in my asscrack.  I thought I got them lodged in there pretty good so when the police ask to search I'm like yeah go for it.  immediately my rigs all fall down my pant leg and on the ground and I'm in hand cuffs hearing my rights read to me.  
     Now this is where it gets crazy.  My driver is trying to lie to the cops and say we were just coming from Ivy Tech to the highway and didn't mean to turn off into the hood, but I know whats up just cooperate and tell the truth when you're already caught and it will be the best thing for you.  So I tell them yeah, we were here to get some dope. Blah blah blah.  Well he pulls me off to the side and is like look we aren't getting anything from your buddy, but we need info on what's going down over here. We know it's a heroin area but we need names and houses. So I'm like ok I'll talk. Now before you call me a snitch, read on.   So I start telling him whatever dumbass bullshit I can think of off the top of my head.  I'm like yeah theres a black guy who calls himself G-Dog in a blue house 5 blacks that way drives a white pontiac, his numbers blah blah blah.  It was all straight bullshit and this cop ATE IT UP. He loved it.  So he's like yeah you gave us some good info so we're gonna let you go, but we don't wanna let the block see us let you go we want it to look like we're arresting you. So he tells my driver to TAKE MY RIGS AND SPOON WITH HIM and drive to the gas station down the street!!! WTF HE LET ME KEEP MY RIGS! And he put me in the back of the cruiser and drove down the block so everyone could see me get arrested then dropped me off to my buddy at the gas station! Have you ever heard of any shit like that?!

That being said, some Aspirin will make it into your codeine solution no matter how careful you are, especially if you're using 100 tablets like I was.  one thing about Aspirin that I did not realize is that it concentrates inside your body over time.  if you take enough doses of Aspirin consistently over a long period, you can OD the same as someone ingesting a whole bunch of aspirin at once.  I started getting Tinnitus and other symptoms of Aspirin OD and did some research and it was a reality check.  Just because Aspirin is safer than Tylenol doesn't mean it's safe.  be careful and don't make my same mistake.  space out your doses and try and keep your tolerance down if you're resorting to Aspirin/codeine tablets",1403783916.0

The SAC (student assistance counselor/substance abuse counselor) who worked for seventeen years at the high school I attended was fired very recently for brokering a drug deal between two students. In the article I read about it, it said that a student came to her complaining that she had been shorted in a weed deal with another student, and that she wanted her money back. The SAC brought the other student (the one who sold the pot to the first student) down to her office and reversed the drug deal. She did not call administration or the police, as is district policy. I am torn between being pleased that there is a job opening in my field (I know, I know, drug counselor, drug addict, not a great mix. Whatever) and upset because I know this woman, and she loves her students and would not want to break their trust by breaking confidentiality. The student who sold the pot to the other student was expelled shortly after the occurrence because he was found with drugs inside the school building, and he said he only had it because of what happened, implicating the SAC. 

What are your thoughts on this, fellow bropiates/skag sisters? Skag sisters. Ha. That's not even a thing, is it? I would appreciate opinions from either side, so if you have one, go all out in details.

Well not just they took him at 7am tuesday. His gf is convinced he had been selling to a UC. The day before the cops came by twice. His sis covered him the first time. The second time i told them he was out of town doing a job with a friend. The next morning they bust in at 7am and took him. Hes stuck in jail on 50 grand bail and although we have a bailbondsman lined up ready to get him out they wont let him bail out until like friday. Hes truly one of my best friends in the world. Hes like family to me. I want to get clean together not alone. This isnt his first strike and was already on probation with a year suspended sentence. I miss him already and hope the judge sees that all his priors are because of his addiction. Im hoping he gets some sort of inpatient program rather than prison. Either way the trial will take months if not a year or more before anything happens. 
Now i sit here contemplating my own sobriety. Only 50% of me wants to get clean the other half loves heroin more than almost anything. I cant figure it out. I could quit cold turkey be sick for a week or two and then be free but i know if im not fully commited it wont work. Im sick of lieing and stealing from family but i dont know if im ready to be clean. Ive got support but all i want right now is my best friend back.

I woke up only 12 hours since my last shot and had restless legs starting. It surprised me that the WDs started so quick from dope.

Anyhow, I took a half a text and it didn't stop the WDs. 4hours and another subutex and a half later, I had to go to work. I took two more subutex with me to work and I had to eat both of them, a half at a time, 4 times over a 6 hour shift, and it still didn't stop the withdrawals. 

The strange thing is, in the 5 years I was doing subutex I never did more than one a day... I ate 3 in less than 12 hours and it still didn't stop the heroine withdrawals. 

I thought that subutex, since it didn't have the opiate blocker, would stop the WDs from happening. 

Am I missing something? I do not have the money to keep doing dope but I can't afford to withdrawal like that again and not be able to work. How do I use the subutex to keep the withdrawals from happening?

vicious and cruel, pathological liar.
if i had the chance, id set you on fire.
push me to my limit, i might just snap.
get in my face, grab my fuckin gat.
im sick and tired of hearing your crap.
i hope you die in prison you fuckin jay cat.

You manipulate my mom, you make her life hell.
on the rest of your fate, my mind will dwell.
how dare you leave, and not pay any money.
knock out your teeth bitch, see if thats funny.
cantankerous at best, you bloated alcoholic.
in the fires of hell, your soul will frolic.
you gave me life, and ill make it or break it.
if i gave you some coke, your dumbass would take it.

You taught me some skills, oh yes you did.
i learned how to lie, cheat, and other shit.
maybe ill forgive you one day, but ill never forget.
all the bruises you left, my body you hit.
you dragged me through hell, emotionally and physically.
all the pain you caused, i wish you could see hommie.
bastardization seems to come in cycles.
your unlocked guns only add to your debacles.

I cant believe, the power i gave you.
wont let me come home for a shower, what gave dude?
im full of resentment, but man i dont hate you.
i pray for you every night, relying on fate too.
youll always be my dad, but never a father.
so what i shoot dope, you never cared nor bothered.
ill always have a mom, who'll love me forever.
you'll always be a tool, but power i give you, man never.

in and out of my life like a pull out couch.
you live in an emotional dumpster, you Oscar the Grouch.
your life may be together, all on the surface.
but youll always be an addict, with no fuckin purpose.
i love my life today, im so grateful to be sober.
youll just end up in prison, stay bendin' over.

i remember the time, right out of 5150.
so insecure, isnt the whole world against me?.
i called you for help, the one time you came.
after the next morning, ive never felt the same.
inside your closet, i felt the greatest amount of shame.

there was an unlocked gun, with a full clip.
i put it to my head, ready to dip.
an out of body experience, tears began to fall.
ready to die, my mind began to call...
it wasnt me, t'was something much greater.
i dropped the piece and stopped being a self hater.
my blood was so hot, just like the equator.
i resumed my life, back to the rad skater.

After sixteen month sober, yeah, i went out.
i needed more research, to see what its all about.
i worked a solid program, but one day i stopped it.
started running drugs, if there was dope id cop it.
the day i went out, smoked a little weed.
little did i know, id start shooting speed.
rompin' to Ashby & Frisco, straight runnin' the trap.
im so sick of that life, its all bullcrap.

The ego was inflated, with the inferiority complex.
my life was so flimsy, just like the latex.
i wanted to get sober, so i told my momma.
arrested with 12 dirty needles, man what a bummer.
called a detox center with another homie.
but even the promise of my 4th rehab couldnt slow me.
jonesing so bad, tried to slam norcos :(
veins looked like dark roots, straight out of folk lore.

so sick and tired, man i was just done.
but of course, shooting heroin is oh so much fun.
ended up at seabright, fixin' in the bathrooms.
came home 6 days later, arms swollen like baloons.
Hep C from shared needles, man i thought i had it.
went and got tested, guess who didnt have SHIT!
God was lookin' out, i give him mad props.
Dont wanna be another Santa Cruz junkie, straight fuckin lops.

Came to the camp, with six days sober.
kicked by myself, felt like redrum all over.
got my last high, wasnt even worth it.
now im in rehab, constipated as shit.
immediately jumped in, right in to the mix.
remembering the wonders of sobriety is my new fix.
all kinds of people, so many backgrounds.
love and tolerance is key, time to act now.

Take the cotton out of my ears, right into my mouth.
there's no way things could possibly go south.
but of course they did, i took back my will.
i cheeked those fuckin meds, and snorted that pill.
told on myself, because that's just right.
first time in my life, i didnt fight or lie.
honesty is a principle, to practice in all my affairs.
i dont have to sink to the drug's dark lairs.

Today is a new day, and that's all i have.
so what i was molested, beaten, and stabbed.
theres so much love and wonder and hope.
that doesnt involve needles, oh that fucking plunger.. FUCK DOPE!!

My experiences with oxycodone and hydrocodone were too expensive and too short-lived, and my experienced with heroin made me think the drug overhyped. Today, I bought some good-quality dope for the first time and smoked it correctly (didn't botch the smoking process like i usually had). Heroin is clearly better than methamphetamine and all other drug in the amphetamine drug family. 

Today, I felt that all my past sins and acts of deprivation were worth it, simply because they brought me to today, where I got to feel so flawless.

I've long lurked on r/opiates, and know that it is standard to inform and OP who is new to opiates about the dangers of addiction and worse. I have done my research, and understand where I could end up (as much as a non-opiate user can understand, anyway).
But i'm rambling now. Have a good night (if you're on the US west coast, like me) and a good day/evening/dawn if you're anywhere else.

Yesterday I thought amphetamines>opiates. Today, I see that opiates>amphetamines.

Most recently, happened on Tuesday. 

Either there are coincidentally flies around a toilet (quite likely), or I have flies living in my stomach. Now, not a lot, but I saw at least one fly around the toilet bowl immediately after I vomited. 

Anyone else experience this? Or am I the only weird motherfucker in this subreddit? I'm not too concerned of larvae living in my stomach, just found it to be very odd. Over these past 5 1/2 months, I think this may be the most amount of times I've vomited. I rarely did during past runs, but for whatever reason I've vomited a lot. Again, mostly following a relapse or doing too much, but if I take too long of a nap after getting high, sometimes I'll wake up groggy and nauseous with a headache -- quite often vomiting follows. And when I did a cold turkey detox at the end of May, I puked up until the 9th day of detoxing. During the last 6 days there were a couple of days in between vomiting, but Jesus, what a horrific detox.

I was in about day 3 of withdrawals, and when i heard the sirens I tried to swallow it, but in the frenzied situation just tried to throw the huge bag in my mouth and swallow it. (it was wrapped around in a regular ass piece of like printer paper like 6 times) My mouth was literally so dry from allthe shit i was going through, and the long car ride to get money then go cop, I couldn't swallow it, and dry heaved that shit back into my hand as they're running at me. So not thinking I just throw it in my door and hope I only saw one dude coming at my car for swerving a little and I get a ticket and go home.    
So they say we know what you were doing, we saw you pick him up from such and such, drive him to that house down blah blah, and he came out and handed you something and you drove away. Just tell us where it is so we don't have to tear your car up and we can figure out what we're going to have to do here. So they handcuff me, I just tell him it's in my car door so maybe they don't find the other stuff under my floor matt in the back (they didn't!!!!!!). So they say basically I have to answer my phone when he calls, come in, and do a couple deals with my dude to get him caught up or they're giving me a felony. This is in Ohio, because I'm sure the laws are different everywhere, can I say what county i'm in? does that make a difference?    
Ever since then... after that I just go home.. been thinking about a lot, this guy who they want me to buy from with their money, and presumably do what else? i'm not even sure. But this dboy is my last chance dude, this guy is from the same area as all my other dudes but drives a beat to shit car and is always desperate to sell his horrible powder. But like I said the WD's and nobody else answering made me call him. That was yesterday morning, and today when my mom got home from work, her and my dad called me over from my friend's who I'm living with, and they tell me some guy called and they know everything. And I was hiding it from them from so long.. I told them I was just picking up for some old friends for a little cash on the side so they didn't know I was using.. but that's not really as important.    
I got sidetracked, but I was wondering what my options here are.. I just go in or I got a felony case? I had one of those police cards that family members give and it was my uncles who's on a drug/gang impact unit or some shit, so they were threatening to call him too. They wanted my dboy's number then and there but I told them I have it written down at home, and surprisingly they just let me go.. and all of them at one point when they were alone with me said something along the lines of.. ""just answer the call, help us and help yourself out"", you know that bullshit.    
TL:DR - got pulled over, cops found my shit, let me go after I gave them my number and they said if I didn't answer and do what they said I'm gonna catch a felony for the shit I had, wondering if I have any options, can't afford a lawyer, and now my parents want to send me to rehab because of the phone call they got.

I came up in $40 dollars last night & called my man. I asked if he still had any of them percs & he informed me that he sold them all (business comes first) 

He's a solid connect and I've made him a ton of money over the years because I also middle man for him. I said ""Well do you have anything at all? Because I have $40."" 

He said ""Well I have 7 blues and that's it."" I said ""Holy shit! How many would you give me for $40 bucks?"" He said he'd kick me down 3 so I was like fuck yeah! He said he was hold up in a hotel not too far from where I was chillin at the time & I said I'd be right down. 

So I get to his room and give him the $40 & he throws me a little baggie with ALL 7 in it! He says ""You know what bro, you help me out so much, just take them all & consider it a gift for all your help."" I was like SERIOUSLY? He was like ""Yeah man, good lookin out.""

Given this information, would you think that these symptoms are related to opiate w/d or am I just sick?

I have been through W/D's before, and for some reason I'm terrified to go through them this time. I just expect the absolute worse. Especially during work because I am outside in the Texas heat all day. Usually, for me to start feeling sick, it takes a little longer than 24 hours.

For my W/D's I have accumulated the following:
One 8mg suboxone strip
5 Xanax bars (slight tolerance)
Multivitamins
Ibuprofen
And I can get lope if I really need it.

So we headed out on what seemed to be a relatively low-risk journey even though we had already been waiting and sweating our dicks off for the past couple hours in the hood. We even had a back up connect lined up finally, but he was going to be another hour and his bags were always scummy. 

When we pulled up to the new guy's spot, he was already waiting on us. ""I knew you guys would come through, hop on in."" His was whipping a brand new ride, not terribly expensive or luxurious, but very nice all around and had the AC blowing ice fucking cold for us. Without hesitation, he throws me and my buddy what was easily a dub rock (each!) to sample and offers us fresh rigs. We were good on the rigs, so we both fired up and pushed off with our free samples. I was floored - this particular stuff was absolute FIRE compared to what I had just gotten a few days prior. I used an entire half G of this other garbage over the course of a few hours the other night and hardly felt well, and it was something like 80 or 90 a half AND a skinny ass bag to boot... So needless to say, my bud and I were completely satisfied. We proceeded to chop it up for a good 30 minutes and lock in numbers. I threw him a Jackson and some change for a bag (no scale - he just eyeballed it and threw in an extra chunk after I already said it looked straight, just for good measure!), and we went our separate ways. For the past week up until today, he has been straight, punctual, and always on deck! I had only read about people getting this kind of luck through this sub, but never in my wildest dreams expected it to happen to me... But it is safe to say that I am officially a believer in the elusive Junkie Jesus. 

Anyways, thanks for reading if you made it all the way through. Has anyone else met a connect in a similar fashion? 

This next shot is for all ya'll out there strugglin... Try to keep your head up and your back straight - something will fall into your lap when you least expect it!

TLDR; broke and sick, stood up by normal connect third time in a row, finally wont have to deal with bullshit for the foreseeable future.

Dear Family member or Friend;

 

This letter will attempt to address some common concerns of those of you who have loved ones on MMT (methadone maintenance treatment). There are many misconceptions and common misunderstandings surrounding this treatment, which education and knowledge about the treatment may alleviate. Methadone, unfortunately, is surrounded by unfair stigma and prejudice based on fears and assumptions, not science and medicine. Family members quite naturally are concerned about their loved one's health and future and want the best for them, and they may have heard some things about MMT that cause them alarm.One of the most commonly voiced concerns is that MMT is ""just trading one addiction for another"". Many feel that the only way to truly recover from addiction is to abstain from all mood altering substances. At one time this was thought by most to be true. However, science has discovered that with long term opiate addiction (opiates meaning heroin, vicodin, morphine, oxycontin, etc), the brain's natural production of endorphins is shut down. Endorphins are the chemicals we all have that enable us to feel pleasure and happiness. We all have opiate receptors in our brains for these chemicals to attach to. The word ""endorphin"" comes from ""endogenous"", meaning coming from within, and ""morphine""--i.e., morphine from within. These chemicals are released when we eat delicious food, make love, enjoy a beautiful sunset, exercise (runner's high), or even when we are injured, as natural painkillers. Without this natural chemical, life can be very difficult and painful.

 

When we flood our systems with exogenous (outside) opiates, our bodies recognize that we have plenty on board and cease to manufacture our own natural endorphins. This results in the patient feeling extremely ill when withdrawing from opiates. They experience depression, irritability, exhaustion, anger, sleeplessness, hopelessness, etc. This happens to all opiate abusers when they cease taking opiates and is to be expected. Some patients, especially those with short term addiction histories, will be able, after a few weeks or months of abstinence, to get their natural endorphins back into good working order again, and will begin to gradually improve. However, for many, the damage done is permanent. This has been demonstrated in many scientific studies involving CT scans of the addicted brain. For these patients, no amount of abstinence, group therapy, meetings, will power, or good intentions will undo the fact that their brains simply will no longer produce endorphins in sufficient quantity to enable them to live a normal, happy life. This is, in fact, very similar to the way in which diabetics require supplemental insulin because their pancreas no longer manufactures insulin. In addition, there are some patients who have never had a normally functioning endorphin system, who have struggled since birth with crippling depression, and who became addicts in an effort to relieve their constant emotional and mental misery. For them, too, abstinent recovery works poorly or not at all. This is where MMT comes in.

 

Methadone is a synthetic (man made) opioid drug, used to treat pain and addiction. It has some unusual properties that make it well suited to addiction treatment. It is a long acting drug, remaining active in the tissues for up to 72 hours after ingestion. It does not cause the high or euphoria caused by other, short acting opiates because it is taken up gradually by the brain, not suddenly and sharply. In fact, many overdoses involving this drug are due to people seeking the high they have come to expect with other opiates and not getting it, so they take more and more. A stable methadone patient who is not mixing the medication with other drugs--particularly benzodiazepines, which can sometimes be a very dangerous mixture-- and who is on a medically appropriate dose will not be ""high"" or sedated. These patients are able to work, operate a vehicle, care for children, and do anything else a normal person can do. Their minds are not ""clouded"". Some of these rumors may come from observing patients who are abusing other drugs, or are taking more than prescribed. Methadone, properly administered and taken, balances the chemicals in the brain so that the patient feels normal. Unfortunately, standard antidepressants generally do not work well for those with dysfunctional endorphin systems because they target serotonin, not endorphins. Methadone is also unique in that it does not attach to all the opiate receptors in the brain, leaving some open to encourage production of natural endorphins if possible. This may contribute to the healing of the addicted brain. Methadone is commonly referred to as ""replacement"" or ""substitution"" therapy, and most think that this means it is replacing the heroin, etc that the patient was abusing, when in fact, it is replacing the natural endorphins no longer being manufactured by the patient's brain, in the same way synthetic insulin substitutes for that not being made by the diabetic's own organs. Methadone treatment enables the patient to return to a normal, productive, law abiding life in a great many cases, and even when the patient continues abusing other drugs, etc, it may lower their chances of contracting a disease by reducing their drug use, and enables them to see a medical professional for assistance and referrals on a daily basis.

 

However, for many (not all) MMT patients, long term therapy--even life long--may be needed to maintain recovery. Addiction is a chronic, incurable disease. We do not tell diabetics, blood pressure patients, and epileptics to discontinue their medications because we know that if they do, the active disease will return. Why, then, do we encourage recovering, thriving MMT patients to do so, when the relapse rates for those discontinuing MMT is greater than 90%? Methadone is the most effective modality of treatment for opiate addiction available today--far more effective than traditional rehabs and 12 step groups alone. By no means is it the treatment of choice for every opiate addict--however, if abstinent methods have failed many times over, there is little point in continuing to try the same thing expecting different results ""this time"".

 

Most experts recommend that a patient remain in MMT a MINIMUM of 3 years after they cease illicit drug use. At that time, if, and only if, the PATIENT themselves wishes to begin a taper program, one can be attempted. Tapering must be done on a slow and gradual basis--no more than 10% of the dose every 2 weeks to a month. If the person begins experiencing severe cravings or withdrawals, they should stop and return to an adequate dose until symptoms subside. If the person relapses, this should not be seen as failure or weakness, but only as evidence that they may require ongoing therapy to control their symptoms. Family support is ESSENTIAL to the patient's successful recovery on MMT, and continued questions of ""When are you going to get off that stuff? It's just a crutch!"", etc undermine treatment efforts and sabotage recovery, leaving the patient confused, sad and frustrated instead of feeling proud and happy at the improvements in their lives. Addiction is a deadly disease and there are few effective treatments for it, so please support your loved one's recovery efforts and praise them when you see improvements. There is nothing positive to be gained by forcing them off treatment before they are ready.

1. If I've been averaging about 8 50 mcg nasal bursts a day for the past 2 months, how long would a cold-turkey withdrawal last?
2. If I don't go cold-turkey, what dosing strategy should I use to minimize both the effects of withdrawal and any euphoric effect from the stuff?
3. Am I screwed?

After getting my hands on some fentanyl I have gradually become dependent on fentanyl and I am looking for a way out. I got myself 50 mg and have used up almost all of it, with maybe 5 to 10 mg left. I dose using the nasal spray method. I don't have a good idea of exactly how much fentanyl I've been using but I have definitely built up a tolerance, and now a dependency as I tried to go clean the other day and lasted just one day. I didn't relapse into binging on it or anything, just small hits to try to feel alert and normal again.

I am financially stable, have a good ass job, and I am very scared. I have a supportive family that knows that I have used many drugs in the past, but I have never actually felt that I was dependent on any of them.

That is no longer the case.

I know I must be somewhat dependent on fentanyl and I know that unless I make a conscious plan to get off the poison I will order more and dig myself into a deeper hole.

My family knows that something is up, but I haven't really 'fessed up to anything. I am planning on staying with them for a bit while I sober up, and I have a job I can do anywhere, but I need to make a plan to quit.

I don't think that cold turkey will work. Just trying it for a day left me lethargic, numb, alternating between sweats and shivers, and unable to eat. I'm having trouble with my bowels and resorting to laxatives to help, although I am trying to use them with caution.

If anyone knows of a way to taper off the stuff please let me know. This is getting serious and I don't want it to get any more serious. I can't go cold turkey (I don't think I can at least, unless somebody knows of a good way to do that and maintain a sense of normalcy) - and I am worried that if I try to ""taper"" down I won't really ever do that.

All advice is appreciated.

What should i do for my dosage? Could anyone tell me what it should be in Micrograms? I have a fair tolerance, i need around 120-150 mg morphine orally, and around 60 mg oxy orally to get high.

How should i ingest it? Ive heard that you should gum a portion of it, but i have also heard you can smoke it? How would i go about doing this? Would i have to adjust the dosage compared to gumming it if i smoke it?

I have been lurking in this sub for a while now just to remind myself that I'm not alone out there. A little background on my situation as if you give a shit. I'm a going on 40 white family man with a half decent job and I've been an opie head for almost 10 years now. First couple years were strictly Vics and percs until about 8 years ago I was introduced to subs. I had a few good sub hooks up until 2 years ago when they all seemed to disappear. After three days without any subs I broke down and befriended a known dope head at my work and things went pretty well with him up until about 6 months ago when he got fired and hit rock bottom
       I live about 20 mins outside of a fairly major east coast city and he had a couple really reliable bag hookups. Any time i called I could go pick him up and grab a bundle of fire bags for $80 and a clean spike. He was happy to do it for two of the bags and someone to get high with. My mistake was never having him introduce me to his dboys. So as of 6 months ago he went straight and my no means do I fault him for it. I respect the hell out of him for it. But it left me high and dry. He changed his number and broke all contact with anyone that had anything to do with dope so I can't even get him to hook me up with someone. 
           The shop I work at is in the hood and I managed to meet a local guy on my own one night on a lunch run. Problem is he's the only guy I know and he knows that, so the first couple months went ok. He was giving me half decent bags at $10 a pop. No deals with quantity but whatever, I'll take what I can get. But the last few months he's been cutting the bags open and splitting them. So say I buy 10 for $100. I get 5 stamped bags with the tape cut and 5 generic plain bags and they're all small as shit. I haven't had a spike for about four months now so I'm stuck snorting them which sucks ass. I can't afford this shit anymore but I can't handle being sick either. I have tried calling every sub clinic in my area and they all say they're at capacity and can't take any more patients. 
        So if anyone actually stuck around to read all my whiny bullshit here is where I need some advice. First off how does one go about acquiring clean sticks? I assume I can't just walk into my local pharmacy and buy them. And second I'm scared to death of walking around the hood trying to cold cop. I'm afraid I would get my ass kicked or at the least robbed. What's a good way of knowing who to approach and how to ask. I'm in dire need of a new hook and I know my city is full of them. 
          Bottom line I became way to dependent on my one junkie friend and now that he's gone I'm lost. And thanks to anyone that made it through all my rambling BS. ",1404099179.0

I CWE'd a few 222's, then (I think) I neutralized the product with excess baking soda. Certainly all the acetic acid is out.

I often get constipated from IV dope, and the longest I've gone without using is about 3 weeks. When I'd finally go, it'd be so fucking painful and it'd ALWAYS severely clog the toilet. Not good...

But recently, I've taken a special combination of laxatives, and it legit turned the football growing inside me into nothing but pure liquid. It's awesome. 

Here's what I did:

Before bed, I took 2.5 capfuls of Miralax powder dumped into a cup of water. I know it says with 8oz. of water, but irdk how much water was in my cup. Then I took 5 senokot pills, and 2 guzzles of Milk of Magnesia (i was lazy, cuz normally I'd measure out 2 or 2.5 full measuring cup fulls, but the measuring cup was downstairs).

When I woke up in the morning, and my digestive system was fully 'active', I felt the need to shit. I could already tell it was gonna be fully liquid. I got on the toilet, and just like relaxed my asshole. No pushing required. And a good portion of the shit that woulda been a football just poured out of my ass... no pain involved!

At least for me, I realized that wouldn't be the end of it. I FEEL done after that, but 10 mins later more pours out. And like 15 mins after that, more still. 

Anyway, I figured I'd share this with you guys. The first time I noticed this effect was when I was bound up from lope. I'd hate to have to use an enema, and I hate taking laxatives, but it only sorta softens the shit and I still have to strain and push while it tears my asshole lol.

Good luck guys. Hopefully this method, or some variation will work for you. Feel free to post any other advice/methods you have on painlessly and easily shitting after being bound up for a few days to a few weeks.

I went to my local grocery store and told the bakery girl I needed two pounds. When I got home I put about 3 healthy squirts of lemon juice and one and a half pounds in a gallon jug. Then I ran the tap water till it was right in between Luke warm and hot and filled the jug with just enough water to cover the seeds. I think the trick is to shake the shit out of the mix and not leave it sit in the water. I shook for about five minutes then used a clean shirt to filter the seeds and water. I then repeated the process with the same seeds. If you do this right the left over water you drink will have a dark yellow smokey color to it and will smell very earthy. I chugged both glasses of water and waited about fifteen minutes and I am on cloud nine! It's hard to explain but for roughly ten bucks it feels like I did two bags of diesel. So I saved ten bucks. And what I just did is legal! Take that copper!  Oh yeah I forgot to mention that I haven't even needed that second pound of seeds yet. It's great. I suggest everyone try it at least once. There isn't a rush like shooting up but it certainly lasts longer. And to answer some questions before I get them  , yes I know what good dope is I grew up outside philly and had a big habit but I've been clean recently and I weigh 300 pounds if you're smaller than me you may want to start on a smaller dose. And my experience was on an empty stomach if you eat it will be dramatically less strong

Edit #1 it's been two hours and the high got even stronger. Little bit of a stomach ache but not nearly as bad as it could be

Edit #2 deff have a day to relax. I couldn't imagine having a lot to do While on this.  

Edit #3 I was laying down and must have nodded out and took an hour nap. The high is only at like 50% of what it was so if you can avoid falling asleep it will probably do you good",1404058806.0
