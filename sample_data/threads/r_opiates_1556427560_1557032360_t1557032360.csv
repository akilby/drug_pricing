BACKGROUND: Experienced opiate user, but I have been clean for over a year. (Used to take about (120mg oxy/day) 

Question: I'm going on vacation here in a couple days and decided to pick up some goodies to have a good time on vaca. (have 6 Morphine 60's and 3 dilly 8 mg's)
 
I know you can't tell me for sure, but I'm planning on using 2 M60s and 1 dilly per day for 3 days. 

Would it be a safe dosing schedule to take: 1 M60 (boofed) around 9 AM , then an 8mg dilly (boofed) around 3 PM, then another M60 (boofed) around 8 PM?  *my main concern here is- would I be skirting the lines of overdose at these amounts with (basically) zero tolerance?

There are only two ways to count them, how many days you've been there, and how many you have left.


It was day two for me, and after being rudely awakened by a nurse at the ungodly hour of 7 I knew what lay ahead. Breakfast, medications, and my first meeting with my still unknown psychiatrist.


Breakfast was instant eggs, pancakes, cereal, toast, and grits. Mira was nowhere in sight so I took my tray to the least crazy looking table of people and sat down.


Holding fast to my west coast identity I traded my grits for fruit with a surely man seated across from me. He poked at his breakfast, itching his arms, constantly watching the clock, another junkie for sure. 


‚ÄúI'm J‚Äù I said introducing myself with a handshake.


‚ÄúEmmet‚Äù he replied bluntly through a bite of egg.


‚ÄúSo heroin or suicide?‚Äù I probed, as everyone's attention turned to me for asking such a blatant question.


‚ÄúHeroin, you?‚Äù He replied monotone.


‚ÄúSuicide‚Äù 


‚ÄúLife's hard man. The sooner you learn that the better.‚Äù he said.


‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I mumbled going back to my eggs.



Back in the common room we watched shitty morning TV, waiting for medications, until a new voice called my name.


‚ÄúSmith?‚Äù asked a short Indian woman in a lab coat. 


‚ÄúYeah‚Äù I said turning around in my chair.


‚ÄúWould you come with me please?‚Äù she said through a thick accent.


‚ÄúSure‚Ä¶‚Äù I muttered getting up and following her to an office room down a corridor. 


Sitting in one of those ‚Äúergonomic‚Äù chairs I ¬†began my first meeting with Dr. Chandri. 


‚ÄúWell you're on quite the list of medications‚Äù she mused.


‚ÄúKlonopin, Vicodin, Seroquel, Naproxen, Lexapro...‚Äù she read aloud, going through my list.


‚ÄúSo what brought you here? It says here a suicide attempt? Tell me about that.‚Äù She said, putting my file down and looking me in the eye.


‚ÄúI was tired of being in pain all the time. I made a partial attempt half a week ago, but I stopped, cause I was asked to be a best man.‚Äù


‚ÄúUh huh‚Ä¶ and what kind of pain are you in?‚Äù 


‚ÄúConstant physical pain, I can't control half of my body's movements. It's like being shocked with jumper cables, just torture.‚Äù I replied, wincing as my body jerked again.


‚ÄúWell there's a medication I'd like to start you on called Suboxone it should help with the pain and if like to up your Lexapro to help the depression. We'll start you on them tonight.‚Äù She said matter of factly, shutting my file and gesturing toward the door. 


‚ÄúSuboxone are you fucking kidding me? I can't get high on that shit! At least I get to keep my Klonopin script.‚Äù I thought to myself, but it was clear she had labeled me as a junkie. 


Sometimes the only way out is through. So like an idiot I agreed with a quick ‚ÄúOK, thank you for your time‚Äù as I walked back to the common room. 


I missed morning medications during my brief meeting with my new psychiatrist, so I headed up to the counter to ask for my morning fix.


A large black woman who reminded me of Medea sat near the counter. After noticing me she turned and said ‚ÄúYou need your meds hunn?‚Äù


‚ÄúYes mamm‚Äù I replied solemnly. Knowing there would be no Vicodin to bless my aching bones this morning.


After swallowing my now disappointing cup of meds I went back to try and find Mira. I wanted to bitch about my cynical psychiatrist but it was already class time. Instead I made my way to my room to wallow in withdrawal. 


‚ÄúSon of a bitch‚Äù I muttered tossing and turning trying to sleep, but it would not come. My life now was pain, restlessness, and pure torture nothing would change that. The hooks of dependency tore at my flesh exposing the creature inside. Bound in chains of hot iron and freezing ice it screamed for just one last fix but no salvation was coming.


‚ÄúMaybe tonight I will get some relief‚Äù I mused but I didn't dare set any expectations.",1557019671.0

So here goes....

I have  struggled on  and off with opiates/addiction for about 8 years. Previous ""heroin  phases"" for me have lasted months and, at most, up to about a year of  heavy daily use. I've successfully gotten clean in the past; however,  this time, with this certain, peculiar ""dope"" has proven to be  absolutely so much more insanely painful and difficult to w/d from than  EVER before - and I had previously gotten through the sickness,  following a 10 month phase of literally the purest, strongest raw i'd  ever discovered, simply with 5-7 days of methadone...... so, i need your  help gang.

So,  for the last  year now,  i've been exposed to the ""caps"", which are  clear little gelatin capsules of ""scramble"" known as ""Man-Down"", ""Black  Panther"", ""A-1"", ""T-O"", ""Black Magic"" - what have you out in the  projects. So, after getting familiar with these caps, and many of them,  increasingly, daily for about a year now; about 4 months ago, I tried to  quit by going on a  methadone program, which, as said above, has very  successfully helped me to clean myself of real dope in the past. My  urine returned some funny results....

After  my  intake, the drug test came up positive for: methadone,  suboxone,  barbituates, benzos, and ""other opiates"", which I was told at  the  clinic is usually the results they see here - with ""other  opiates""  being stuff like fent, carfent,  and any of the other 24+ analogues now  floating around in the mix these days. I was perplexed as to why, only  playing with these newly familiar caps, and some xanax here and there,  why there's methadone and  suboxone, barbs, and the ""other"" in my  system, which I had always assumed was fentanyl - but at this point,  after doing some research, I'm prettyyy sure that it's a much stronger  fentalogue that is far worse, especially considering that one day when  trying to get clean from this stuff, I felt totally fine for the first  like 18 hours absent with just a little bit of methadone  and like 1mg  of xanax..... I guess that's just 'scramble'. But, my understanding was  that Fent has a super short half life and from previous w/d experiences,  before these caps, I would start getting sick off of presumably classic  fent-laced stuff in like 5-6 hours after dosing.... SO, I'm super  perplexed as to why my w/d with these things can get so bad after quite a  bit of absence and then go on for so long after....

So,  I tried to break up with the scram kaps ..... **WORST WITHDRAWL I HAVE EVER  EXPERIENCED IN MY LIFE.** Even with 50-100mg of methadone, heavy-duty prescription (like 800mg) tylenol, muscle relaxers,  ***nothing***  made  this crazy sickness much better. it went on for like almost a  week before  I, of course, and unfortunately, gave back in and decided  to just keep getting curing with caps.

For a while now, really my whole life, all I've wanted is to be **done**.  And it's time that I do it for real. I've accumulated a decent arsenal  for beating the sickness,  consisting of: some morphine 30s, some percs,  tons of Kratom, Iodium,  clonodine, xanax, high strength tylenol,  muscle relaxers, suboxone,  about 500mg of methadone (saved up from the  clinic), even just ordered some herbal stuff like: Gaba, Kava, 5Htp,  l-theanine, etc. just the herbal w/d stuff that pops up when you search  for it on Amazon lol but haven't tried em yet, and whatever else you  name it. Plus, of course, I have access to whatever else I might need -  maybe you all could make some recommendations for me? idk.  I  truly,  truly, truly, deeply, so badly want to beat it, more than anything.

So,  I guess, I'm here asking for your advice, your suggestions, your tips  and techniques, any experience  getting off of fent/fent analogues,  subs, whatever else is cocktailed in/any sort of similar types of ""dope""  that you've maybe dealt with before.  (would be great if anyone on here  happens to be familiar, in any way or form, with any of this sort of  new age, nasty, awful fucking shit.) I've been suggested and looked into  Tianeptine and Phenibut and was curious if any of you have experience  using those for w/d on similar types of insanely strong/long lasting  fentalogue sickness???

Another  side note, I thought recently that maybe I could experiment with some  straight up raw to ween off of this stuff, as I've read some people on  here have had  success with in the past. I discovered some pretttyyyyy  nice stuff;  however, I could taste like basically the whole g and still  feel sick without the caps. This is so fucked up, seriously.

So,  yeah, I don't  know who else to turn to for this because it's such a  weird, specific,  today's day in age issue that most traditional W/D  methods don't even apply to this situation, considering the insane  strength, power, time length of half-life, and hold that these new   synthetic opiate analogues can have over us. Any sort of advice or any  tips, recommendations, or ideas, etc. of what has helped or worked for  others in a similar or even somewhat similar situation, in any way  possible, would be life-saving, seriously.

Thank  you in advance for any help or insights you can bless me with  whatsoever. I'll be forever grateful.Thanks for your time and your  considerations.",1557001737.0

The first thing I noticed is that my my eyes tend to ""glitch out"" pretty often, while staring at a computer screen or smartphone. 

The second thing is: I find it extremely difficult to swallow on heroin, it feels the same way as when it becomes difficult to after doing it several times in a row. It always takes me a few tries until I am able to swallow once. This might be due to some Amphetamine I had taken earlier that day. 

Another thing I have a question about you guys might be able to answer is: 
Yesterday, after smoking quite a bit of heroin (no tolerance) and about 60mg of Amphetamine, I was waiting for the bus to town with a friend of mine when I noticed that the floor, the pavement's texture was moving in strange ways. Kind of like LSD visuals. I thought it could have been a strange light thing so I asked my friend about it who said he wasn't experiencing any visuals. Do you have any idea what could have caused this hallucination? 

After getting off the bus and entering another friend's apartment, I proceeded to throw up in his bathroom.",1557000896.0

I swallowed it in pill form, and it was directly from a pharmacy on a prescription. I was also drinking lots of water through this experience. also yes i am probably stupid. apologies for any mistakes, i‚Äôm still in some pain laying on my floor and am also on mobile.

I took 15mg at around 9:20 and sat down doing something. I stood up an hour later and felt airy and cool and shit like that. Then I started feeling tingly and electric and excitedly sexual, like when someone arouses you. It wasn‚Äôt impressive then. I thought it would get more intense since it was just the first hour, so I wasn‚Äôt bothered. I felt a little nauseated and had a mild headache and my psychotic symptoms were a little more intense than usual.

Thirty minutes to an hour passes and I notice I‚Äôm not high anymore. Then I get more nauseated and the headache becomes horrible, I am twitching occasionally, and I‚Äôm super tired. I can‚Äôt really focus on or process anything but I‚Äôm still mentally ‚Äòthere‚Äô.
You know how people use deliriants and go full delirium, or hit dissociative holes, or blackout, or otherwise just detach from reality entirely in a world-spinning trip? I wasn‚Äôt anxious or depressed at all but I felt like that was about to happen. I sort of wanted it to. Not legitimately, but irrationally, I expected to go full breakdown and lose myself even though emotionally I was just fine. I was like this for four hours.

I stood up and my headache and sickness went away and I started eating everything in sight and the physical problems disappeared. I was motivated and not tired. This lasted around an hour. Then I was sick, the headache was back, I was feeling lightheaded, my insides seemed to be tingling and I felt like I was having a panic attack even though I was not consciously anxious. Like a really deep panic. 

I just now (3:30) sat down and ended up throwing up. I don‚Äôt feel nauseated or anxious anymore, at least right now. that ass of a headache is still here though, i feel like i was hit in the head with a hammer but otherwise i‚Äôm fine.

any kind of reply would be appreciated, part of me just wanted to talk about it. i don‚Äôt quite know if i i did anything wrong because although i researched this drug before i took it, i am still very new to it and probably managed to miss some basic 101 ‚Äúhow not to feel like hot garbage on hydrocodone‚Äù piece of advice, or if maybe my body just doesn‚Äôt play well with it. I don‚Äôt think I should have taken it on an empty stomach, or maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have taken 15mg, but it still feels weird that it was that bad and that the high was that short. just wondering what anyone else thinks",1556999351.0

All you have to do is go to my profile and the very top post click on the title and you‚Äôll be able to see the comments where my guide is. But anyways since people can‚Äôt seem to do that here‚Äôs a new one 

Dabbing 101

When it comes to dabbing a lot of it is really preference. You can literally use whatever different types of dab devices you want to dab tar. I‚Äôve been dabbing for 3 years now, and I‚Äôve literally experimented with every kind of dab tool/device there is and in this little guide I‚Äôm just telling you what I think works the most efficiently with tar without wasting your sack, because I‚Äôve wasted tons of dope when I first started dabbing, and even now when I get a new nail or rig I tend to do it. 

You can use any kind of dab rig, nectar collector, e-nail whatever the fuck you want doesn‚Äôt matter. 

The nail is the important factor here. 

TITANIUM is the way to go. They‚Äôre more expensive but it‚Äôs the best way to dab it. 

Ceramic nails are pointless and your dope will just melt in the nail and it‚Äôll be stuck there forever. Although, I‚Äôve used a ceramic tip in a nectar collector and it worked very well but they break easily and don‚Äôt last long at all because they can‚Äôt handle the heat. 

Quartz nails do work.  I hate using quartz because it can be harsher at times, it has a funny taste, and you end up wasting a lot of dope. One of our dealers dabs too and he literally has over a hundred different dab rigs I‚Äôm not even kidding. He likes to use quartz just because that‚Äôs what he‚Äôs used to but he also wastes so much dope it‚Äôs ridiculous. So unless you have the dope to spare go for titanium. 

Now I‚Äôve learned the hard way when it comes to purchasing nails that there‚Äôs different grades to them. At least with titanium there is. I guess that there‚Äôs different grades to titanium that‚Äôs used in the nails and it makes a huge difference. There‚Äôs only two smoke shops in my area that carry the higher quality grade nails and all the rest carry the shitty ones. The difference is that the lower grade nails don‚Äôt last nearly as long. They can be very harsh! And you can see the cuts of shitty material in the nail if you look at it an angle. If you go to purchase one ask them at the smoke shop if they carry titanium T2 medical grade nails. They might not even know what you‚Äôre talking about but they might. Do yourself a favor and do some research and educate yourself a lil bit. Titanium nails aren‚Äôt cheap so you want them to last and the shitty ones don‚Äôt last long at all. 

Season your nails! Whenever you purchase a new nail you want to season it. All you have to do is get a jug of water and have your torch and butane ready. Get some pliers or something stable to hold the nail and you want to torch it red red red orange for like idk 2 minutes then pour the water on it and cool it down. Then repeat. Do that for about 5-6 times and you should be good to go. You‚Äôre just breaking the nail in. 

I think I‚Äôve covered everything but if I remember something I‚Äôll add to this later. 

One last tip. This is the most controversial debate I have with everyone on here. Should you put water in your dabber? That‚Äôs up to you. I always have water in mine. It makes it smoother and when I‚Äôm dopesick and can‚Äôt get anything the dab water is a life saver. You make a little cup/bowl with foil dump the dab water in it and heat it up with your torch and cook it down. When it‚Äôs cooked down you‚Äôll be able to smoke what‚Äôs left and you‚Äôll get well. The darker the water the better.

I met with my best girlfriend and we wen shopping for the party, meaning we buy loads of booze and beer. So after shopping we went to her car mechanic and collected her car. She threw me out at home and I got ready for the party. She then collects me again at home and we go to her place where we were partying. At this point I already snorted about 1g of dope and was nodding from that and also popped 12mg of kpins, plus 400mg of DXM to potentate it all. Which works emout eery time. But I had a reaction to it this time and my eyes were sobbing read like they were bleeding. Fast forward to 1 am. I already drunk about half a bottle of Johnny Walker and 8-9 German strong beers with 12% alcohol/ 1/2 a litre. Anyways anotger guy on the party offered me some weed and I didnt smoke for month. So I smoke half a blunt with 80/20 mix of weed and tobacco. So fast forward half a hour, I was super fucked uo and decided to go home. And I need to say that I just started using again, I relapsed, and was high as a kite. The alcohol, the dope, the weed got its full grip on me. I was nodding hard like I ever do when I mix in weed to my drug Cocktail. So I was on 1g of dope, 400mg DXM, 200mg DPH and 10mg kpins and the good ole booze I drank like water. So yeah at 1 am my girlffirnd sent me home to go to sleep. I walked home. Ripped my cloth off and could sleep after days like a baby. Slept 9 whole hours without waking up once. So now I know that I also need more seld controle  it sometimes fucks me over. But I know know that If I need to rest that good again I definitly need to get some good weed to sleep good again.

This story doesn‚Äôt have a happy ending, it doesn‚Äôt even have an ending for now. How was it for you, that very first moment you tried an opiate? Did you knew what you were getting into? Or just curiosity took over you?  

A little backstory here, when I used to be in med school I was not a bad student, but did have depression issues which started even from before, when I was a teenager, I never got any kind of professional help or treatment and sort of waited for it to get better, I started smoking a lot of weed, it was the only thing that could calm my anxiety a little.

One day by some random chance a pack of tramadol landed in my hands, at the time I had some kind of cyst on my skin that have been there for a while so I wanted to remove it by myself (it eventually disappeared) I took one of those pills to see if it could take care of the pain while I took care of the cyst, it turned out it felt really great, I forgot about the cyst, and just loved the feeling of bliss, everything was perfect, I had no pain, nor emotional nor physical it was something close to pure happiness, I just started taking more and more pills, I knew the risks, all the side effects the probability of getting addicted, but it did not matter to me, I just loved the feeling, once I took them every day in high doses for about 2 weeks, next morning I woke up feeling really sick, all of my body hurt regardless of how I sat, I had nausea and a terrible diarrhea, I knew the only thing that could make feel better would be some more pills, it took a great deal of will power to not cave in, thankfully the withdrawal did not last long and I survived that time.

I stayed clean for a few months, then I started taking it for a few days in short doses so I would not get a withdrawal, eventually I finished med school and started working in a hospital as an intern (that is basically a doctor that has to be on call over 30 hours every 3 days and gets paid very little or in my case nothing, so I was a something close to a slave) The pressure and stress was overwhelming and I was falling deep into depression, almost getting kicked out for insubordination a few times.  

With time I tried more powerful stuff codeine, and oxicodone (I really liked this one) however I always made sure to take as little as possible, I did not wanted to have withdrawal again, everything ends and so my supply of pills did, I was nearing a breakdown, one day at work I was just locked, could not do anything and got a disciplinary notice for that, I just felt so low and without purpose, I hid myself in a bathroom and laid in the floor crying for a few minutes, I just wanted all of the pain to end, go home and kill myself somehow. Fortunately I got a kitten the next day, it was from my ex-gf she could not keep it and I took care of her, that sweet cat somehow became a reason to keep living, however this was just temporary, this was in November 2018.

January of 2019 came and I had this particularly terrible shift on new years eve, I had to come in the 31st of December and got out on January 1st and since our boss decided to change all of our working teams I needed to be on call again the next day, I was so tired, I got in a little argument with my boss and well eventually I was given the day off and a sort of ultimatum, I could continue with my ‚Äúwork‚Äù at the hospital or just be done with it and be given all the papers that proved I was there for a whole year (in my country this year of internship is necessary in medicine, plus another one of social service so you can have your medical degree).

By this time I was breaking down again, since I had no way of earning money with this ‚Äúwork‚Äù I still lived with my parents, so I told them about the situation and the offer I was given and how I felt, I never really talked to them about mental health issues because they were not the kind of person to believe in such things and always would inject their own ideas over your own believing they were the wisest in that area of knowledge (well this time my mother was the only one behaving like this, surprisingly I got more support from my father) So I choose to stay at my hospital and I started taking antidepressants, Fluoxetine (some of you may know it by the name Prozac) I took it a few times before but never committed to the treatment, this time I took seriously and began taking the maximum dosage which is about 80mg daily or 4 pills.

Little by little I started getting better, and even enjoyed life and looked for the future, however the pills did take care of my depression but made me an unfeeling ghost, I started doing really risky and reckless things to feel something, I went out with a lot of girls, and a few boys, I did not even care if they had a boyfriend or not, which led to a future problem but that is not really relevant now, despite that and my medication the depression slowly crawled its way back to me, I went from feeling  nothing to be in pain all the time, the emotional one, I think you may understand this very well. Eventually I got my hands on pharmaceutical degree morphine and fentanyl, morphine was my favorite, however I needed a lot of it to achieve a high so I stayed with the fentanyl.  

I just loved the feeling, and everything about it, calculating my dosage, loading the syringe, applying the tourniquet, finding a vein, cleaning the skin, piercing it with the needle and feel that sweet pain as I saw blood inside the syringe, then I would take off the tourniquet and pushed the plunger, all of the pain would go away in almost an instant, and I would feel so good and happy, I finally understood why people did it, why it was worth all of the trouble, the thing literally affects the part of your brain responsible for pleasure and happiness, it was literally bliss in a vial!

With time my tolerance got higher and higher, I wanted to do it every time more often and all of my arms ended covered in bruises, and guess what? The depression was not going away, it would seem that every time I sobered up it got stronger. I wanted to end it all again, however I got it under control, more or less.

I used to get the fentanyl from the operating room in my hospital, I would sneak in at night and was successful at it.

Recently someone hacked into my cellphone, whatsapp specifically and whoever did it sent conversations and pictures to an ex-gf with whom I was on terms of getting back together, needles to say this totally broke her heart and ruined everything, at one point she got a call threatening her, she never told me what it was said to her nor she has spoken to me ever since, I just felt lower than   in any point in my life, out of control, I did not knew who did it or why, I hated myself for everything, for having hurt my ex-gf, and all the people that ever knew me, my family. I just could not take it anymore, that day I was on call, the whole day I was really slow and did not do much work, I just wanted to die.

In my backpack I had some benzos (diazepam and lorazepam) which I used when I could not sleep, however I knew if I took them alone they would just make me sleep and would not kill me.  

I waited for the night and sneaked into the operating room as I usually did, this time however all the entrances were locked so I was able to open a door just by sliding a card into the door frame (really bad security if you ask me) once I got into the storage room I began looking for fentanyl I wanted it so I could mix it with my benzos and finally die painlessly, as I was getting out with the vials of the stuff a nurse that was on call on the operating room saw me and stopped me. 

She noticed that I had taken the vials and asked what I was doing there, I thought about lying but at the time it was more than obvious that she knew I was doing something shady, I do not know if it was fate or any of that nonsense, but if she hadn‚Äôt stopped me I would of killed myself successfully so I just told her the truth, I was stealing drugs so I could kill myself, she took all of them away and we talked for some time, obviously she reported this the her boss.

The next morning I was called by the boss of the Operating Room and one of the hospital‚Äôs anesthesiologists just asked what the hell was I doing at this place at night, I knew they already knew most of the story, so I told them about the depression, the addiction and my attempt at suicide, I was wearing a surgical uniform and my bruises were quite noticeable.  

They told me that I really needed to get professional help and commit to it, since addiction as we all know it is a disease, I finally accepted I had a problem, after that I went to meet with my boss and had to tell him the whole story again (he already knew some of the details) He said he needed to report this to the director of the hospital and as for what is my fate in that place I yet do not know.  

A friend of mine a psychiatrist gave me the number of one of her acquaintances who is an expert in addictions, I contacted her and the only option was being institutionalized for more than a month, for now I haven't talked about this with my family but I will, and most likely I will be sent to that place, as for my career who knows what will happen, I guess Monday is the day I find out.

For now this is all, I just hope this story helps someone to stop before it is too late and to get help, it is okay to be vulnerable, and if you out there are thinking about trying opiates for the first time, just don‚Äôt do it, once you get to know that feeling you won‚Äôt forget it and always will want some more.

TL DR

I am a doctor, got addicted to opiates, started taking pills then I escalated to pharmaceutical grade fentanyl which I got from the hospital I worked, one day I wanted to kill myself with it and mixing it with benzos, and a nurse stopped me while I was taking the fentanyl from the storage room, now everyone knows, I probably will be institutionalized for quite some time and I may have screwed up my career for good.",1556949453.0

Rapid sub taper - 6 days - 4 days no subs. Slipped up briefly one day but got back on it and kept going.,"Hey guys been on this sub for about s year. Had a previous addiction to Dihydrocodeine/morphine some of 2017/2018 and then was clean (although on and on off loads of different drugs, especially pregabalin which is horribly addictive stuff). At the beginning of 2019 I started doing H and it quickly became daily use. First it was .1 a day then .2 a day etc (was smoking it). At first I just got it off the dnm's but then it was the street and that inevitably got me into crack. By March/April I could spend 50-100 quid on crack and H in a day. The streets drained me. 

Anyway - just thought if anyone is my age / in a similar position you can do it! I did a rapid sub taper (8,6,4,3,2,1)mg and then jumped off. After a day and a half I caved to the w/d's hitting me and bought 3 balloons of H. Did one but then flushed the other two, which was the best decision I had made. I don't think it impacted my progress at all and so I kept going. 

A BIG part of how this is working for me and is different than usual is because I actually got the confidence up, with the help of two friends, to come completely clean with my GF and my parents. Their shock is understandable given that they see me nearly every day and hadn't noticed anything. But I had to do it to save myself from ... myself! Now it feels much easier trying to stop knowing that other people understand an are there for you. I realised my habit of concealing my feelings and use in the past had only led to more of the same. 

The w/ds aren't great, they fluctuate and sometimes it isn't nice. But Imodium, hash, bit of booze, herbal shit really helps. Keeping busy too - I work at a cafe - and knowing went to just watch tv for hours is important too.",1556954409.0

My current daily habit is five to six 30 mg Oxy. I consider myself very opiate tolerant in general, at times taking upwards of eight 30‚Äôs a day in the past. It‚Äôs been this way for awhile, more or less. My current objective is to sober completely, as it‚Äôs just come that time in my life. 
I have three suboxone strips. They‚Äôre orange with N8 printed on them. The dope man says they‚Äôre 8 mg each.
I don‚Äôt know much at all about suboxone, so any advice is appreciated. If anyone knows a schedule for tapering with these strips that they or a friend has used that would be awesome.

bkgq1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bkgq1x/wow_kratom_is_actually_better_than_oral_morphine/,16,https://redd.it/bkgq1x,HalcyonicFrankfurter,WOW Kratom is actually better than oral Morphine!?,"So I've been a DHC and Kratom user for almost a year now, but no previous experience. I recently came across a good deal for some morphine sulfate wax bead caps 100mg each. Apparently these have the least wax and other garbage of any morphine pills.

Anyway, so I tried to extract the wax from the caps using Dichloromethane. It didn't work very well, so I gave up on that. I may try some hexane later. So I ended up just crushing the beads into the finest power I possibly could and just downed half the pill. I waited a few hours and felt a minor euphoria after 1.5 hours, so I downed the next half a couple hours later. I got a little more effects, but not much.

I am blown away that my usual daily Kratom dosage is 20g and that felt much more euphoric and just stronger in general than 100mg of morphine. I'm pretty surprised by that. Maybe I didn't fully defeat the time release. It does seem to be lasting longer than the Kratom.

What do you think? IS oral morphine really just that weak or did I not defeat the time release properly?

Can anyone recommend a good solvent or way to defeat time release? (Please don't tell me about syringes and wheel filters, I've seen these posts, but I'm not an IV user so it doesn't help me.)",1556938219.0

I am a 30 yo M. I have smoked marijuana for about the last 15 years (shiiiit sounds weird saying that) and quit about a month ago.  Also a moderately heavy user of mostly prescription opiates (beside the rare use of a lil D intranasally/orally, never intravenously) and have used both past 2 weekends both pretty small amounts in comparison since my tolerance is insanely low. Also been using a small amount of buprophorine/naloxone during the week. 

Couple questions..  

After researching, it looks like cocaine and marijuana are the hardest toxins to remove from hair which should not be an issue.  In comparison, does anyone know how hard is it to remove traces of prescription opiates?  How do tests differentiate prescription opiates vs illicit opiates, and what is the average panel test used.

I have read that there is a high rate of success in passing by using a regimen of detox shampoo in the weeks prior, it's called Aloe Toxin Drug Test. 

Any of my fellow degenerates been able to pass a hair follicle test using a detox shampoo? I plan on quitting going forward... but we all know how that goes. Hoping for good news or advice.. or ill be prayin to JJ.

Todoay I went and picked up from my usual source, everything went smoothly but on my way out the car he informed me this bit of heroin is white. I have heard of ""China white"" but being from the UK I have never actually seen it. This bit of gear is almost completly white but if you properly inspect it, the fine powder has a very slight brown tinge to it but taking a quick glance you would say its white, possibly even confuse it with cocaine. I have heard and also read online that you cannot smoke China white however this smokes perfectly and runs on the foil like a normal bit of gear. Once you have burnt the gear on to the foil it turns it's usual colour and you wouldn't be able tell it was white beforehand. When you are running the gear on the foil you can see a slightly transolucent outlining to it which you don't get a normal bit of gear. It's not particularly strong but it's not weak either, a low 7/10 I'd say. So the gear smokes fine, hits fine and the 0.5g looked pretty big. 

I was just wondering has anyone else seen a bit of gear like this or knows what it is and or why it's so pale? It can't be China white as China white doesn't run on foil. In 3 years of smoking I have never seen anything like it in the London area

!! EDIT !!
I was also thinking cut but when the gear was melted it was smooth as glass to run your finger over, usually heroin that has been cut is sticky when melted. Also for how white it was it would had to have been 98-99% cut. But this gear wasn't weak at all! Very strange..",1556926516.0

Anyway, I do their stupid online questionnaire the day before the appointment which by the way took at least an hour to complete or else I would‚Äôve had to check in 1 hour before my appointment which I thought was extremely ridiculous. I go to my appointment the next day, saw the doctor and was completely honest about all the meds I am taking, even the ones from Mexico (20mg oxycodone 2-3 times a day as needed) and expressed to her that I wanted to end the pain I‚Äôm experiencing in my feet and figure out a plan to do that and eventually get off of oxycodone. Well guess what she says, she said ‚Äú20mg of Oxycodone 2-3 times a day is way too much for such a young person like you. We don‚Äôt even prescribe that to cancer patients. I don‚Äôt know what kind of doctor you went to but that is way too much and before I can help you with anything, I need you to completely stop taking oxycodone and quit cold turkey then come back in 2 weeks and then we can work out a plan of action.‚Äù I was dumbfounded and speechless. I couldn‚Äôt even think of a response. 
Later in the evening she gives me a call telling me that she‚Äôs called my psychiatrist and suggested to him that I be taken off my Klonopin as well. Luckily, I have been seeing my psychiatrist  for almost a year now 4 times a month and so he‚Äôs gotten to know me quite a bit and disagreed with her. I saw my psych the next day and he did not agree with anything she‚Äôs said. He knew that I had gone to Mexico to get pain meds as I am completely honest with him. 

For her to say that they don‚Äôt even put cancer patients one that amount of oxycodone and suggest that I quit cold turkey makes no sense to me. If that‚Äôs so much oxycodone, wouldn‚Äôt I require a taper or some sort of withdrawal assistance????? Of course I know this but I didn‚Äôt say it as I was speechless at the time. I could follow her advice and if the pain plus the withdrawals got too bad I could do what many people are doing today when they can‚Äôt find pain medicine or aren‚Äôt prescribed some anymore, go to the streets and buy pressed pills, heroin or kill myself. And obviously I‚Äôm not gonna do that but WTF?!?! I came to her so I can get legit treatment and this is what happens. Fuck these new laws. Fuck this ‚Äúopioid crisis.‚Äù All it‚Äôs doing is making life for those who are in real pain fucking unbearable.

A slow warm feeling rushing over
Her gentle hands slowly put you to sleep
As you picture another reality in your mind

Because she wasn't who you thought
She sunk her claws in
And when you left, you got sick

The uncontrollable nausea
Sore aching body
A broken heart
Unable to sleep, eat, sit still
Wanting nothing but her
So easy to fix

But you ride it out.
Day 5 you can hold some food
Day 7 you can eat properly
Day 10 you're back to normal

Almost

You still don't sleep
Not properly
Maybe an hour here or there
And you think of her
Because she will make you sleep
She will ease your mind
She is comfort

And no one knows
Because it's 'food poisoning' or 'a bug'

But you remember her
She was everything you wanted
Everything you needed
She made you comfortable in your own skin
A feeling you haven't know your whole life

My question is - would having say 1/3 or 1/4 of the 150mg cap today get rid of the sick feeling or add to it? Just like how if one was hungover from alcohol, more drinking would get you ""back in the zone"". Please let me know cus i dont want to feel this way.

Please help me.,"TL;DR: I am slightly bipolar (cyclothymic disorder) and just got on Lamictal. Ever since getting on the medication, Oxy is no longer enjoyable. It just makes me vomit and nod out super hard. I loathe nodding - it feels like dying to me. Does anyone know if these two drugs interact somehow?

I've been a recreational opiate user/borderline addict for the last few years. Really started using oxy quite frequently after my tonsillectomy in November 2018. I go on binges of oxy use where I consume up to 100mg per day, then go clean for a couple of weeks when my dealer is dry.

I was recently diagnosed with Cyclothymia, a form of bipolar disorder where I'm basically slightly manic all of the time. The diagnosis sounds very accurate to me based on my sharp personality change around age 17-20, where I randomly went from an average guy to a super-driven always-motivated dude who needs a perfect GPA, etc.

Anyway, i was prescribed Lamictal about a month ago. Started at 25mg, upped to 50mg after 2 weeks, and now I am up to 100mg. The psychiatrist says my target dose is likely around 200mg.

I relapsed this last week despite feeling a good deal better on the medication. I think I've been self-medicating for years and that I wont really *need* opiates once this medicine really kicks in and I hit my target dose...

WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY QUESTION:

Does lamictal interact with oxycodone somehow? Ever since getting on this medication, as the doses go up, I literally feel the way non-addicts have always described opiates to me. I get super fucking nauseous after the euphoria, I nod out and have to fight to stay awake, I basically completely pass the itchy stage and go straight from euphoria to ""god this is awful.""

Does **anybody** know if Lamictal and Oxycodone are interacting and fucking with each other? I'm starting to think the lamictal is curing me of the mental health issues that made me an addict, and now I don't even like this drug that was once my nirvana.

Please fill me in. If oxy continues to feel like this, I really do think I'll go clean forever.",1556848140.0

bk2lse,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bk2lse/can_i_tell_my_story/,40,https://redd.it/bk2lse,secretdopeaccount,Can I tell my story?,"Long time lurker, but finally decided to create a throwaway specifically to post here. 

I'm no rookie to opiates. However, I started using H (snorting) about 6 weeks ago. I do between .5 and 1 gram daily, more if funds allow. 

I never wanted to do heroin. Despite my use of pretty much every other drug under the pharmaceutical and recreational skies, I always swore I'd never touch it. I honestly thought you could only shoot it, and didn't even know it was classed as an opiate. 

The way it happened, was I was told by my husband, who has ""hidden"" his use from me since we've been together, that it was powdered Percocet. Okay- I know you're laughing, but hear me out- I had absolutely no reason to believe my husband would lie about something I was putting in my body. And he played it off perfectly (""so weird babe, the Percocet guy said he's only got it in powder or liquid form"" with the baffled look and tone to really sell it). Plus, he had only admitted to using pills during our relationship, so I stupidly believed him.

But that first line... oh lord it was beautiful. Everything I love- itchiness, nodding, didn't even mind throwing up because I just felt so damn good.

It wasn't until a few days later when he bought a gram and it was brown. I knew right away. I had been doing heroin. Keep in mind I'm on the east coast of the US so I'm sure most of the shit we buy is fent. But at that point, I didn't even care. 

Now here I am, 6 weeks later, and I can't believe how quickly things are escalating. You see, on the outside, we are a totally ""normal"" and functional family. My husband works a strenuous 60+ hours a week job, and I am at stay at home mom with my 8 month old son. We rent a small but decent house in a nice quiet town, have a couple of dogs, and we're happy. Or it looks that way..

But the reality? I'm depressed. My son has a serious rare illness that made the first month of his life scary and unpredictable. When we were finally able to bring him home, all the emotions from his trauma combined with post-partum hormones and the loneliness of being a stay-at-home parent hit me all at once like a fucking train. I started drinking occasionally (baby would go to bed, I'd relax and have a couple of cocktails). But then I started drinking a lot- and often. I could feel myself spiraling. I have a baby that needs me- I can't be a drunk. But I needed something -anything- to get me out of my head for a while.

I knew my husband had access to opiates. And after being sober for a year and a half through pregnancy and breastfeeding, I was ready to get a little fucked up.

He kicked the can down the road for about a month, always coming up with some stupid reason for why his guy didn't come through. But HE was high, and I knew it. What the fuck?! I tried to convince myself that he was looking out for me. I know now he was trying to hide the fact that the only thing he had definite access to was heroin. 

When he finally got me a Percocet, I was nervous. Excited, definitely. But paranoid that I was sealing the deal of becoming a bad mother and a bad person all around.

I got so high I spent the whole night puking and nodding out, with no enjoyment whatsoever. I guess snorting a whole 30 after not even smoking pot for almost 2 years will do that to ya. I was so disappointed. I had built this up for months now, and I fucked it up by doing too much. 

For the next two weeks or so, we did them every 2 or 3 days. I slowly worked my way up from snorting half a pill at a time, to being able to do 1-1.5 a night. And I enjoyed it every.single.time.

And now here I am, in the thick of it. Watching everything fall apart. Running out of money by Monday every week. Borrowing from friends and family with detailed excuses, while our fridge is bare and the gas tank is always closer to E than the letter F. Riding the weekly rollercoaster of physical and mental decline on Wednesdays and Thursdays, counting down to my husband's next paycheck. 

We were already behind on rent due to spending so much time in the hospital with our son, and now we owe our landlord thousands of dollars.

Our son is happy and overall healthy, and always taken care of no matter what. It's like my brain forces the rest of me to power through withdrawal symptoms so I can make sure he's happy. Being a mom has always been my dream, and I truly cherish every second I have with my boy. 

I just wish I could function without always feeling like I need to be on something. I've never been addicted to one certain thing (besides nicotine) and have always just chased the feeling, if that makes sense. 

I think everyone's got something they depend on. I'm just so scared of losing my son. The ONLY person who knows I use is my husband. Literally no one else. Well, except now all of you. 

I'll be amazed if anyone actually read this whole novel lol. Just wanted to share how I ended up here.

Hope everyone is doing well tonight!",1556845614.0

for instance i hate oxy because whatever quantity i do i wont ever nod, its too stimulating
while dilaudid is my favorite opiate, the rush euphoria and nod are just perfect and i never noticed its duration was shorter than anything else...


but what stays on my mind is all the posts i see about F-ing Opana.  Oxymorphone, to my knowledge, isnt marketed in Canada. Never had the chance to try it, not even heard of it on the streets.
But y'all talk like its the best recreational opiate available. How does its effects compare to oxy and dillys? is it stimulating? sedative? why is it considered so good that youre willing to pay 50-60 for a pill of it? while dillys are like 10-20bucks... and are so fucking good themselves compared to any other opiate even H...

&#x200B;

 

Some background to this really frustrating problem that I have been having...any help at all would be so, so appreciated...I know its long, but if you take the time to read through, I appreciate you!

I am a heroin addict, have been for coming on 15 years. I have had some periods of staying clean, I think my longest was 3 years. I have been in and out of NA programs, never fully committing, never fully believing. In January 2019, I had the worst overdose to date and clawed my way out of that back to some semi-stable ground. It's been an up and down roller coaster of progress since then, with some minor relapses with kratom involved.

Last month, I decided to start looking into the Vivitrol shot. I did my homework, got all of the information I could about it, read reviews, read every Reddit post there was regarding Vivitrol, and finally made the decision that I was going to give it a shot (no pun intended). The first week was terrifying, full of regret and a complete shock to my system. I was very unprepared for the sudden reality that no matter what, I could not get high. Almost like a security blanket of 15 years was being ripped away from me. It was sudden and intense. After the first week, things started to get a little better. I got used to this new reality and although it never felt 100 percent comfortable, it certainly got a little better. That is, until the third week. As soon as my brain registered that getting high would be a possibility soon, it was off to the races again. I felt like, my brain had been deprived of endorphins (even natural ones) for these 21 days and my cravings became worse than they ever have been. I started using and didn't stop for a week (although the high was seriously diminished).

I went to my next Vivitrol appointment, was 100 % honest with the doctor and told her that I wanted to get back on suboxone. Historically, suboxone works wonders for me. It acts as an antidepressant, an anti anxiety and completely demolishes my cravings to use. The doc put my on 12 mgs per day (full strip in the AM, half strip in the PM).

The first thing to note here, is that the pharmacy gave me generics (Sandoz variety). Second thing to note is that when I started taking them I was 28 days from my last Vivitrol shot. I figured that I might not feel the Suboxone full blast, but that after 30 days, I would be good to go.

I started taking the subs, as prescribed, and quickly noticed that I was not feeling better. Usually suboxone gives me a noticeable anti depressive effect, increased energy and overall better mood. For the entire first week that I took the subs, I felt almost nothing, nothing positive, nothing negative. I figured maybe my body metabolized the Vivitrol super slow and it was just taking a long time to clear from my body.

Fast forward to 35 days after the Vivitrol shot. I start to notice a very strange reaction. I take 8mg strip in the morning, get about an hour of feeling pretty good (although NO WHERE as good as I remember suboxone making me feel) and then I get about 3-5 hours of feeling absolutely HORRIBLE. I get hit with a very dysphoric feeling that is characterized by extreme irritability, anger, general hatred towards life, depression, feelings of doom, no motivation and no ability to interact socially. After about 5 hours, this feeling disappears and I'm left feeling exhausted and minimally depressed (although not as bad as the initial feelings).

I have now been taking suboxone (12 mgs a day, sometimes more) for a little over 2 weeks. It has been 45 days since the Vivitrol shot was given to me. I am still not feeling the positive effects of suboxone anywhere near what I remember feeling from them in the past, getting the few hours of feeling HORRIBLE, irritable, depressed, angry, and then returning to a slightly depressed baseline for the rest of the day.

My thoughts are that if I am going to get myself dependent on suboxone again (and eventually have to suffer through the horrible withdrawals from suboxone), than the effects should BE WORTH IT. I should be getting more positive effects, than negative. Suboxone has worked SO WELL for me in the past and I don't even know what other options I have, if I were to stop taking it. I would fall back into active addiction immediately.

So, I reach out to YOU for advice. Do you think the less pronounced positive effects and more pronounced negative effects from the suboxone are due to lingering effects of the Vivitrol shot? Do you think they will go away soon? Do you think it it due to the generic form of the Suboxone? (I have always taken name brand). Or any other reason you guys can think of?

I really need some advice and insight here. I need to know what do, as the negative effects are seriously wearing on me. I don't think I can deal with them much longer but I desperately do not want to full back into using. Thanks guys.",1556823068.0

bjspc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bjspc2/need_advice_for_starting_pain_mgmt/,7,https://redd.it/bjspc2,AlternativeJosh,Need advice for starting pain mgmt,"So I wrote a novel but I wanted to provide some background and fully explain my situation and where I want to take it. Please PM me if you'd like to share personal anecdotes or have any questions or need details in order to help form advice. I'll do my best to read And reply to all comments. 

About 10 years ago I had been diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and was prescribed 120 Vicoprofen (7.5/200 hydro/ibuprofen I believe). Long story short I lost my IT job, got divorced and lost custody of my beautiful and smart and cheerful daughter , got involved with the wrong crowd who were engaged in various fraudulent and some even greaseball creep stuff, eventually moved in with my parents in a different state. I had no insurance and minimal income at this time and had acquired knee injuries (torn ligaments and arthritis) that resulted in severe pain while standing, walking, sitting, etc over the previous few years. 

I started using a legal and easily accessible opium based product( I won't sPecify exacTly what but I'm sure many of you know) in order to dull the pain enough to work and keep my job. This was unsustainable in dosing and expense and led to a devastating tollerance and so a friend recommended that I try going to a methadone clinic for the time being. He said it was the same as though I had enrolled after losing my insurance and access to legitimately prescribed meds. 

After about a year and a half at the clinic I dropped my dose from 70mg down to 30mg.  My employment and financial situation got much better - I became a manager at a retail shop that does around $10k in revenue daily and is part of an immensely profitable franchise. I now have good insurance and get paid more than I ever did when using my Bachelors IT and Accounting degrees.

I decided to go to a pain management doctor after my Primary doctor referred me. This pain doctor saw I was coming from a methadone clinic and immediately decided in her mind I was a junkie. She prescribed me subutex and swore up and down there would be no issue taking it. I went into severe precipitated withdrawals 30 minutes later as I was driving to work and started convulsing within an hour. Needless to say I won't be going back to this particular doctor. I later read my visit notes and she falsely put that she kept me in the office for an hour, not the 30 minutes she actually kept me. She diagnosed ""surveillance of opiate abuse"" and noted that while it appears I truly do need pain meds in order to lead a functional life due to my conditions she intended to remove me from all pain medication.  I was honest with her about the clinic and the meds I took before then. My urine test came back with only the meds I was prescribed. I was truly traumatized by the experience. 

I asked the methadone clinic if I could readmit but they said since I intended to ween off of the methadone starting immediately they wouldn't readmit me. I had saved enough of my take home doses to do an 8-10 week taper. With the help of some short acting opiate meds after 4 weeks I am down to an average of 10mg a day.

I have 4 MRIs scheduled this week from the first (evil) pain mgmt doc and I intend on doing those, taking receipt of the results myself, and then going to see a different pain mgmt doc - the one my father sees and has a good relationship with. This doctor, while not knowing the details, told my father he'd be glad to see me. (side note - my girlfriend also say this doctor and received 180 x 30mg Roxy and 10 x 75mcg /hr fentanyl patches until she had a slip up and tested positive for a medication she was previously but no longer prescribed.) 

So here is my situation that I need help with - I feel like I should be honest with this next doctor involving everything from the meds I was on years ago, the situation that left me going to the clinic, the experience with the first doctor who treated me like an addict and not a person and was borderline negligent with her treatment. I would like to ask the doctor to treat me with pain meds that aren't methadone and would allow me to function and be able to hold my physically demanding job. I'm not trying to get huge bottles of oxys and morphine capsules and fentanyl patches. What I would like is enough pain meds to control the pain while also exploring additional treatments such as injections and physical therapy.

Tldr ;  Should I be entirely open about everything with the doctor? Should I leave out some details and if so which ones and why? How common is it for non-drug seeking patients to utilize a methadone clinic during periods of unemployment/uninsured and/or relocation to a new region. Any other advice? How do I demonstrate that I'm not  trying to score pills but a middle aged man who is desperate to not lose this job and house and life that I worked harder than I've ever worked for before?

Please any advice at all. My life is finally getting back together after losing everything (lost job largely due to alcoholism and I'm now 6 years since my last drink. Lost freedom due to hanging out with a scumbag... I got in trouble for something he did and he walked scot free but with counseling and focusing on improving my life that is years behind me).

> Pot has a very rough outline of the different levels of being high. I thought it would be fun to see if we have similar levels when describing opiate highs. I am not an expert and I know there are many different types of opiates, but maybe it could serve to help people avoid withdrawal.

something about that little post really got my brain up and racing. i immediately started writing, and after awhile of some good old-fashioned, ""write first, make sense later""-style-spitballing with myself, i came up with what i believe could pretty much be like a sort of opiate user's travel guide. enjoy.


.

here's my two cents

the seven levels of being high:

1. **Not high:** no opiates for more than a week, no lingering effects, complete sobriety
2. **Aware of an effect:** a day or a few days after cessation of use, when if you concentrate you can still feel an ever so slight opiate effect. quality kratom yields an effect somewhere in between here and buzzing. you won't look, sound, act, or think abnormally at this level
3. **Buzzing:** either on the come up or the come down, an easy buzz and euphoria is present. breathing is noticeably gentler. pupils don't usually pin just yet, they tend to pin somewhere between a strong 'buzz' and a light 'high'. you could be 'buzzing' in a room full of doctors who've written papers on the effects of opiates and get away with it as long as you're careful. you might blink suspiciously slowly or slur once or twice at this level. also you might accidentally wear just pure bliss on your face if you're not careful
4. **High:** during peak hours of effect on a mid-range dose for your tolerance. background itchiness that goes away with one or two benadryl, pretty decently strong euphoria, and very self-evident respiratory depression (to the point that one might try to breathe more deeply and quickly because they know they should, before giving up not 30 seconds later). the gentle hint of a nod will start to creep in during the waning hours of this state. it'll be pretty easy to resist it, but the option is there. your now-pale ass' pupils will pretty much always pin by this point. to have a remote chance at being at this level unnoticed during work or a family gathering, you'd need to keep your energy level and cognition *as close to your normal as possible* (overly energetic or overly chill WILL give it away). your best explanation as to why you look like such shit would be a hangover, but that only explains so much. the one caveat; hide your damn pupils. they're going to be a dead giveaway, especially with blue or green eyes. plus if the people you're with know you use, or know you have a history of using, you really aren't fooling them at this level
5. **Fucked up:** during peak hours of a high-range dose for your tolerance. *overwhelming* euphoria and sedation, feeling the nod coming for your ass but just *barely* able to fight it and stay awake (the good ol' pirate technique is the defining sign of this state). probably a lot of respiratory depression but just way too high to notice or care, EXTREMELY pinned pupils to the point that even strangers will notice involuntarily. pale as fuck, red eyes, slurred speech. the waves of euphoria are now strong enough to derail every train of thought, but depending on their frequency you MIGHT be able to get away with a quick phone call if you're lucky. you really can't explain your way outta this one. you will look, act, speak, and think like an absolute zombie. please stay home if you're 'fucked up'
6. **Nodding Out:** when the nod you could *just barely* fend off while 'fucked up', comes back with a vengeance and a fuckton of reinforcements. you would have to take enough opiates for it to be considered ""pushing your limits"" to get to this level. if decently nodding while 'fucked up' is sex, then this level of 'nodding out' is rape. 'nodding out' is the step beyond euphoria and, from what i've seen, pretty comparable to a mini coma. at this point it's flat out impossible to do anything other than sit or lay there, feeling the nod absolutely engulf you. as soon as you feels yourself surrender (willingly or not) to this gargantuan nod, you then instantly skip forward in time to when you wake up, sometimes without any sensation in one or several limbs if you nodded out on top of said limb(s). this may or may not be permanent. the highest reaches of 'nodding out' reach the borderline of falling out. if you experience this kind of nod; this gigantic, completely unstoppable nod that's strong enough to even lead to loss of limbs, you are playing with fire. *there is a big difference between catching a nice, fat nod and uncontrollably nodding the fuck out. don't push your limits when you're at or even anywhere near this point.*
7. **Overdose:** well ladies and gentlemen, you've made it past that pussy shit and have made it here. an overdose. you'd better have a lot of people prayin for you, and you'd better hope to god whatever you just put inside your body wasn't enough to induce a lethal overdose. if not, you are officially grade-A fucked. overdose can range from mild to massive, and if you're at this point, you're either a braindead moron, suicidal, a braindead suicidal moron, or unknowingly used something laced with fentanyl. fent will look at your so-called 'high' tolerance, laugh its ass off, then proceed to take a shit all over you and your mortality. i think most everything about overdose is already pretty clear to most of you. odds are you are intimately familiar with overdose, either from personal experience or (god forbid) from friends or family. narcan can reverse an overdose in progress. always carry narcan guys. for your own sake, for the sake of your friends, for the sake of your family. if you have lost someone to an overdose, you could take comfort in knowing all they ever felt was the nod-to-end-all-nods; they passed on in complete and utter bliss. please be safe everyone. <3

p.s. as you all know, opiate highs are dynamic and can be very different even at the same dose taken by the same person. 7 levels i listed, but i went back and added examples of sensations that could fall in between categories. consider this a fluid scale of opiate highs. idk if youve ever watched [anthony fantano](https://www.youtube.com/user/theneedledrop)  review an album, but at the end of his breakdown & analysis, he gives the album a number scored 0-10; except he does the way i did with the quality kratom line. he gives each album a ""light-to-decent, decent-to-strong, strong, decent, light, strong [0-10] to light [0-10], etc etc. the emphasis isn't on the 0-10 part, those numbers serve more as a sort of skeleton that each review is based upon.  i think that format works very well here. quality kratom is a strong 'awareness of effect' to a light 'buzzing', a mid-range dose of your DOC can be a strong 'high' to maybe even a light 'fucked up', and a strong 'nodding out' could also overlap with a light 'overdose'.

cheers guys. i put way too much effort into this. u should save it, could come in handy. i know i'll be using this comment to keep my ass from dosing like a flaming retard when i find myself with just enough oxy for one BIG dose *or* two sensible, average ones. i wrote this for us as a community. this might even work as a responsibility/accountability type thing. that's what i'll be using this for anyway.

wishing yall the best. may you coast nice and firm into that coveted light to decent 'fucked up'. happy [consensual] nods all <3",1556769634.0

 This all started about 7-8 months ago when I became severely depressed and got no support from family and doctors refused my help. I started to turn harder drugs after smoking 12 blunts and drinking an entire bottle of jack with a friend until you‚Äôre both stumbling around trying to find anything for support just didn‚Äôt cut it every weekend. I knew my dad had been prescribed opioids for the past 5-6 years so that was the first thing I thought of. Opioids... the word itself had a certain haunting demeanor, Am I really about to cross this line? This is the next level of drugs the class that heroin is in, the drugs that if I get caught with I go straight to jail on narcotics charges, the drugs that destroy almost every users family and relationship . This is real. Will I be able to do this without getting addicted?..... Fuck it. I go into my parents room when they aren‚Äôt home. (At this point they didn‚Äôt lock their door every single time they left the room for fear that I would break in and steal.) Anyways, I see many many pill bottles but I know what I‚Äôm looking for. I see it. ‚ÄúOxycodone hcl 10mg‚Äù. They‚Äôre they are, a full script too, nice. I open the bottle and pour a few into my hand. Pink pills ‚Äúk-56‚Äù. Wow I‚Äôm really about to do this. I do some research on dosage first. I‚Äôm a bit of a risk taker so I decide that 2 pills should be sufficient. I crush them up put them into a line, roll up a dollar pill and sniffed away. The first head rush was unlike any High I‚Äôve ever experienced, complete and udder peace and solidarity, I felt like I was in tune with my body and mind and that I connected and socialized much better. The next day I wake up in my chair still sitting up, I must‚Äôve nodded off. That was amazing, but I can‚Äôt do that again. Highs like that come with a price to pay. Flash forward to now. Just found myself downing 40mg of anti-diarrheal pills. I need to stop this now. I‚Äôve not done heroin yet, but the deeper I fall into this hole the closer I can feel it coming to me. I‚Äôm not looking for advice or anything of that nature I more so just wanted to share this story with all of you. I feel once I break this barrier of depression And start to feel better I can start putting some pieces back together. But one step at a time. 

TLDR: became severely depressed, weed+alcohol didn‚Äôt help, fell into a rabbit hole of dependency of the euphoric effects of opioids

Edit: also thought I‚Äôd mention that the only reason I stooped to taking anti-diarrheal pills is because I can‚Äôt find any pill plugs any where around me and dads pain meds are now all replaced with xtampza, plus I don‚Äôt live with my folks anymore.

so last year I had a solid relationship. he didnt know what I took, how many, any details and didnt ask for details. he just knew it was something besides weed. it worked out perfectly bc we didnt go out a lot. most of our time was at my house bc I just didnt have the energy. we were neighbours so thats pretty much why. it worked out well and it gives me hope for future relationships. especially after the exp I had a year prior. 

now a year before this (2 years ago) I had been open and honest abt everything to a separate person. my chronic pain. the fact I use opiates to help it. well he drugged me. we had smoked and he insisted we use his weed. I said ok. next thing I know, I am in the mall and lost my purse and keys. I know meds. that was SOME type of benzo laced shit. he then tried blaming it on the fact I take opiates. I was disgusted. I said I have used opiates half my life basically and have smoked weed w it before. you dont randomly have lapses in memory and leave your fucking keys and purse in the mall (which you had no clue how you even got in the mall) 

so my question again is: can yall have stable, solid relationships w chronic pain and opiates ? if so, do you tell the person ? I just dont know wheres the line to say ‚Äúthats enough info‚Äù",1556758945.0

&#x200B;

That said, do yourself a favor and go online to an online pharmacy (there are two reputable ones, if you search the trans mtf/ftm boards youll find the names, or message) and buy a bottle of Bactrim (also listed as ""Sulfamethoxazole / Trimethoprim"").  Buy the highest dose and get a big bottle.

&#x200B;

It's fairly cheap and may take a week or two to show up, but then once you start to get an infection, you can take on in the morning and one at night for 10 days or so and most will clear up.  After the 10 days itll be barely there, but your body can do the rest.  Most docs just give this out anyway when you show up (Ive had it happen 4 times, finally got wise)  **DO NOT STOP TAKING THE PILLS EVEN IF ITS GETTING BETTER, DONT MAKE TREATMENT RESISTANT STRAINS YOU DICK**

&#x200B;

**Obviously, if the infection gets worse after a day or two of starting, or is streaking, or your fever wont go away, or is generally getting worse, then GO TO A FUCKING DOCTOR AND DONT LOSE YOUR LIFE/ARM/WHATEVER.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Also, buy the big ass bottle of $500 and you can sell some to other junkies and make back your money fast.

Studies have shown that it cures most MRSA and other things like that when caught early.  Ive also seen studies that, when taken very quickly, it can stop endo.

I use this now, when a few beers or Gin and Tonic's (Has to be plural) will not touch the sides and the mental health wolves are at the door again. As I was about to drink it, anticisipating the storm in my head calm down, it reminded me of something a few years ago...

I feel we all suffer some kind of trauma in our lives and we have (As I read in a book) a moral obligation to dig deep and find light in the darkest moments but that's not always possible, in my experience, suicide, loss of friends, family, horrendous domestic abuse and other things poisoned my early twenties and caused a lasting effect of severe anxiety which completely varies. Once it's in your life I feel it shapes you entirely. I can be completely fine 1 minute and out of nowhere suffer a huge anxiety attack which feels like I am dying, every painful memory or experience is right there in front of me, guilt and panic, anger and frustration. Other times I can go weeks strong, completely fine. My sex drive is high, I want to laugh and love and enjoy being alive. 

I went to the doctor's in the midst of my troubles and saw a lady, this is in the UK. I was completely, emotionally hers, I sobbed and told her that I felt like I was in hell, that often I cannot get my breath, that I am chomping 20 Kalms at a time, I'd read books, watched videos, reached out to friends but the fact was that I believe, still believe, whether I am right or wrong that I was suffering a chemical inbalance in my brain, I couldn't escape the dread, I couldn't sleep nor eat, I felt nauseas, I was crying randomly, out of nowhere whilst trying to work. It was hell, my own personal hell.

This is the bit I don't understand and interested to hear other people's experiences. 

I'd been given some Diazapham from my Grandad to help me at work and having had one, they improved my state tenfold. Just knowing they were in my back almost made me not need them, it was as if, I had a friend who was there ready to fight these dark moments and don't get me wrong, I enjoy not being sober, but back then it was more need rather than want. 

The doctor prescribed me Propanolol, she told me that Diazapham is highly addictive and the only reason elderly people have them is because they are addicted and can't come off them so more often than not they had a repeat prescription. She said they used to have a nickname as 'Mummy's little helper' and we're just handed out like sweets. Propanolol is a Beta Blocker and I am just going to come out and say it, for me - did absolutely nothing except maybe calm my heart rate. I couldn't get them. I couldn't get anything further. Now I use liquid codeine which is an Opiod and I think to myself, had I been prescribed the help I needed for the dangerous attacks that in my line of work could have killed me or somebody else, I would potentially be in such a stronger space mentally now at 27. 

Has anybody else experienced the nightmare of trying to be prescribed any kind of Benzodiazepine? 

Kind regards, Sami.

Nothing has helped, 4 years ago I started kratom, it was the first time in years, that I felt joy again. I took it daily for 3 years managed to get a qualification for university, found my girlfriend and everything seemed nice.

After 3 years I also used subs, morphine and poppies. Never had to be sick, I always got enough money, never IV'd and kept my tolerance down thanks to Memantine.

A few weeks ago I had an incidence with the law, they seized a package of opiates and I had to stop to keep my drivers license. The acute withdrawal was ok, I had seroquel, gabapentin and kratom to make it 'comfortable'.

But the following weeks were terrible. I was such a salty overemotional asshole, insulted my girlfriend and she didn't know why I suddenly reacted like this. I didn't want to work, I started cutting myself and fantasized about suicide...

Then my lawyer won the process and I started using again. Now I'm stable. I'm happy and life is bearable again. I hate that I need opiates to function but I'd rather be dead than sober...

I just need to talk and rant with my r/opiates fam because you guys understand it all more than anyone.

&#x200B;

The other night I went to the ER. I was in EXTREME pain. More so than usual. I normally NEVER ask for opiates anymore because they don't give them to me and I don't really want them, I, however, always expected in an extreme situation they'd treat the human, not the addiction. 

Whelp. 

I was wrong.

At the ER I told the doctor I seriously needed pain relief that it was way beyond what I could physically cope with, that I need to be treated with dignity and properly. She tells me that she can look into getting me another Subutex dose. I tell her no, I really need a legitimate opioid right now. She goes, ""how about Torodol?"" So, I get that, and a little later I ask her why she can't give me a dose of pain medications for legitimate flares. She gives me a pamphlet that says, ""We don't give IV medications for flareups of chronic pain, but we do give oral medication instead."" So, I asked for something oral and she told me no and walked off.

I turned to the nurse and stated: ""All that does is make people want to use heroin.""

The nurse then says: ""T***hen that's good because it's on you and not the doctor and the doctor's license.***""  So I ask about the oath to do no harm and the nurse tells me he's not going to argue it with me.

It's so fucking disgusting.

IDK The point of this ... I just needed to rant. I get it that I'm in recovery and that I'm not actively using, aside from Subutex, I'm just frustrated and angry that in legitimate situations I'm treated less than dog crap all because I made the decision to get off day to day opiates.",1556674546.0

Of course it sent me straight back into withdrawal after I had spent 6 days detoxing. Lucky me, I got to go through it all again. For the whole duration of these 8 days I‚Äôve just been obsessively thinking about getting more. 

So on Saturday, I give the plug his money and he tells me he‚Äôll have 50 pills on Monday. Alright, cool. I feel like shit but I can make it until then. 

Monday rolls around. No dice. Now he says he‚Äôll have it on Tuesday. So I wake up today, and he can‚Äôt meet until tonight. That‚Äôs ok. Little annoying but at least I know I‚Äôm getting something eventually. Now I‚Äôve just learned that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù on tomorrow.

Using his situation...you're addicted to oxy, but for a solid week you switch over to another opiate...once the week is up and you stop taking the new opiate...will your oxy addiction be gone?

Ok so this is extremely odd situation but I think it merits getting posted some place for informational purposes.   


I have been taking drug test issued be the US Federal Department of Corrections for the past 2 months, and today I was informed that all my drug test have come back positive for fentanyl (i have taken about 8 over a 2 month period and they are just now informing me)...Which I have not done fentanyl in well over 2 or 3 years.... So lets dive deeper.  


First off - NO IM NOT BULLSHITTING I HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY ILLICT DRUGS INCLUDING FENTANYL NOR AM I AROUND IT OR ANYONE USING IT.  
Second - I have insisted that i get the urine samples sent to the lab to get GMCS aka more accurately tested and will update the results and maybe even post pictures of the results if I can.   


So what could it be? I am on a lot of other medications and Supplements:  


1) Adderal

2) Naproxen 

3) Wellbutrin

4) Humaria 

&#x200B;

I also take a number of vitamins and supplements daily:  


1) High doses of vitamin B-12

2) High doses of Ginger and Turmeric 

3) High doses of Vitamin 

4) Resveratrol 

5) Nicotinamide Riboside  
6) Kratom

&#x200B;

Yes I take Kratom - Which if you even suggest that kratom is the cause of the false positive in the kratom community they crucify you, block you, and call you a shill trying to spread fear.... SO LET ME MAKE IT VERY CLEAR... I DONT THINK IT IS THE KRATOM THAT IS CAUSING IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT IS Psychically Possible it could be.   


So what could it be... Could the humaria which is a biologic and immune system depressant be crossing with another compound and causing the false positive?    


What is the likely hood that they run the GMCS lab test and I still come back positive?  


How likely is it that something I am eating be it tea, vitamins, food etc is causing this false positive?  


What would be the best way to figure out what is the ""thing"" causing the false positive?   


Please understand I am not trying to spread FUD or anything like that I legit am going through this situation and I am trying to wrap my head around a legit  explanation.

However, this is the worst it's been taking around 450mg (give or take) daily- yes, I know really bad. 100% oxycodone in pill form- snorting only.

My plan is to do it cold turkey (as that's how I've always done it and it's the only way I can do it- especially with a full-time corporate job, I know myself and need to be honest). Should I have any concerns or worries by going through the process with a little Xanax and Clonidine as needed? My plan was to use the two together in minimal amounts for 24-36 hours or so until I can transition to subs for a few days. I totally understand the concern and view of individuals against subs but given my job and current situation, I can't be incapacitated for too many days. I've never had an issue with subs and getting off of them. 

Essentially my plan is to use Xanax and Clonidine until I'm safe to take subs and then sub for 3-4 days and then take Xanax as needed to subside any withdrawal symptoms without subs. 

Am I good to go with this plan? Should I have any concerns that could potentially hospitalize me such as a seizure? (zero history of seizures but the idea always scares me for some reason when thinking of getting off oxycodone). Any other recommendations?

I normally get my blues for $35 each so I was excited to try these. My normal dose is 4 blues snorted, 3-4 times a week. I have a very high tolerance. 
 
Xtampza capsules contain tiny wax beads. Each bead is its own time release mechanism. 

There is very little information online on how to tamper with the time release to make it IR. My guess is they haven‚Äôt been on the market long enough for us pill heads to crack the code. 

Here is what I tried: 

I opened 5 capsules into about 3 ounces of concentrated lime/lemon/grapefruit juice. I let the powder (tiny waxy beads) sit in the liquid for about 10 minutes. I then placed it into the microwave for 55 seconds, just enough time to bring it to a boil, then immediately placed it into the freezer. Once cooled down, the wax beads clumped together and floated at the surface. Kind of like when a hydrophobic liquid is placed in water, like olive oil in water. I let it sit in the freezer for 10 minutes, then placed it on the counter at RT for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Down the hatch. 

After 25 minutes I begin to feel the effects of oral Oxycodone. Def not placebo. 

I‚Äôll try and update you guys in the comments as the night goes on. 

Anyone have any experience with this time release mechanism? If this goes well I will be purchasing more since this new plug has thousands of these stashed and they are way cheaper than blues. 

Side note: these contain 27 mg OXYCODONE, opposed to 30 mg Oxycodone HCL found in common pills. The 27 mg is metabolized into the equivalent 30 mg Oxycodone HCL. 

I would love ANY information on these!!! Thank you bropiates and happy nods!!!!",1556585959.0

So I'm prescribed Oxy 20mg x 4 per day for a month for a plethora of injuries, mainly from falling close to 20 feet and lived, thankfully, but also from various sports injuries from high school as well as played D1 sport in college.  Although, after that fall from 20 feet or so, and waking up in the ICU of the hospital with a cathrader in my dick was unpleasant, but a story for another time. 

I go through the hell each month of picking up my script, drop it off at the pharmacy, pick up, go home, no problem.  I start to put my pills in my weekly counter, so I don't short myself and it helps keep me on track...but I notice my bottle is wayyyy too fucking light/empty feeling. So I count all the pills out...sure as shit, I'm 60 fucking pills short! I start freaking the fuck out, first, because there is no way in hell a pharmacist is going to believe this, let alone my doctor's office.  So I immediately get back in my vehicle and head straight to the pharmacy, because no fucking way am I letting 60 pills of oxy 20mg slide. Not. A. Fucking. Chance.  I tell the tech what happened, she is cool as shit with me, non-judgemental (wish there were more like her)...she's like okay, let's figure out if we are off on our count ect....so about 10 minutes later, she comes back and is like our count was off, and the pharmacist is going to start filling the rest of your missing pills..I take a deep breath for the first time in what seemed close to a hour.  

The pharmacy tech can tell I'm rattled and is being cool as shit with me....I live in a good suburban town, have a high end job, and am legit about my prescriptions in that I don't sell, I don't take more than I have to, and I don't fill early or any of that other bullshit I'm sure pharmacist and doctor's office have to deal with on the regular.  Anyway, I see a new pharmacist walk behind the counter (shift change maybe?), and two minutes later this different pharmacist calls out my name...I approach the counter, and she begins to lay into me about the missing pills, and how it's not their fault (keep in mind, they just counted 10 mins ago, and the computer count vs. the manual count was OFF 60 pills...the SAME fucking amount I'm missing. Not only is she berating me, but she is doing so in front of other customers and all the staff, who anyone within hearing distance could hear what medication I was on and my name, which, again, is bullshit and embarrassing. I look over at the other pharmacist and tech standing there with my newly filled prescription bottle in hand and my old prescription bottle, which I brought back in with me to show them they fucked up in the other hand.  So I'm confused as hell what is going on...one pharmacist filled it, and the other pharmacist is like bullshit, you're not getting it without a new script from your doctor to account for the missing pills. 

So I'm straight pissed now, because I have to go back and try to explain this to my doctor's office now? yeah fucking right, except that is my only choice, so I grab my original script bottle this is shorted and I drive back to my Doctor's office, explain to them what the hell happened, they are confused as I am...it looks like for sure I'm not getting a new script....my doctor calls the pharmacy, talks to the one pharmacist who was willing to fill my script the first time around, pharmacist explains that their count is in fact off by the same number pills I'm missing....Doctor is getting pissed because he can tell this is no way my fault and I shouldn't be punished for half of my months script gone missing because of whatever bullshit is going on in the pharmacy, but at the same time has to cover his own ass with this bullshit crackdown on pain meds. Thankfully, he writes me a new script, the nurses make a copy of it, detail all the bullshit in my chart, and as I'm getting ready to go, the doctor tells me next month we may need to look at lowering my script because the MME's are too high...even though this is what I have been on for a while and it is what he prescribed me to take...so I'm like fuckkkk. 

Take it back to the pharmacy, the cool pharmacist takes care of it...while I'm waiting, the one pharmacy tech that was cool and helpful at the start of this whole thing, apologizes for the bullshit earlier and that pharmacist that stepped in and told me to fuck off was way out of line, given that everyone realizes I'm short the exact amount of pills that they have extra of.  I pick up my missing pills from the pharmacy and head home where I'm writing this now.  I'm sorry for the length of this post, but had to get it off my chest, because I felt completely fucking helpless, knowing how even though it's clear the pharmacy fucked up the count...it's still not in my favor. I feel thankful and lucky my Doctor/nurses and the one pharmacy tech and Pharmacist were cool as shit about it, especially because they all could tell I wasn't trying to pull one over on them...but fuckkkkk that pharmacist who stepped in out of no where to stop things from going forward without this type of bullshit and fuckkkkk everybody who judges people for taking opiates with their holier than thou bullshit attitudes. Wait till you're in pain and let me know how that Ibuprofen/Motrin combo works for ya. Bottom line, I don't care if you take opiates because they are prescribed to you by a doctor, or if you take them because you like them and help you function throughout the day....quite, frankly, good for you, if that's what you want to do, hell ya. But this whole crackdown on opiates is really fucking hurting people and making people like myself feel so damn helpless and embarrassed because we take them. If you read this far, I appreciate it.

So my question if you narcaned yourself would you immediately get most of the dope out of your system ??  And would this speed up the withdrawal time line ?

Or if they separate and you‚Äôre completely in withdrawal mode ...


 anyone have any experience with this ? Maybe got narcaned and stopped using if so did you feel like it was shorter or was it the same ? Also was the effects after the narcan the worse part of the withdrawal?

biufyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/biufyv/update_on_my_situation/,28,https://redd.it/biufyv,Stoff115,Update on my situation.,"I stopped using fenty ‚ìÇÔ∏è 30's cold turkey on the 9th, first time attempting to quit after over a year habit. So as of tomorrow I'll be 3 weeks clean. I should feel great, but I don't. All the anxiety & depression and body pain that made me use in the first place is back and worse than before. Every time I wake up I have a sense of impending doom and freak out wondering if my mom and dog are still alive and okay, and going to sleep takes hours from the pain and insomnia. I got my insurance together and seen a new doctor a few days ago hoping to get my xanax prescription back cause anxiety has always been an issue for me and xanax is the one thing I never abused (I just don't like it in that way I'd rather take the dose prescribed (0.5mg or 0.25mg most of the time) and be anxiety free when I go out rather than take more and get hungry and black out). It took 2 years of going to the psychiatrist for me to even get the xanax, tried everything else but nothing helped and by the time I got xanax I already had to drop out of highschool from the panic attacks. So I see the doctor and he orders a blood test, ask if I've ever done any drugs (of course not, never, what are droogs?) and I start explaining my prescriptions I had before which was alprazolam, cymbalta, & hydroxyzine. He interrupts me and says ""I won't give you alprazolam, it's addictive and a tranquilizer. Let's try zoloft""...WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN I TRIED THAT SHIT ALREADY AND IT DIDN'T DO SHIT BUT MAKE MY COCK STOP WORKING. Then this is the kicker, I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was younger. The scoliosis is fucking with my sciatic nerve and is what is causing a good protion if my pain. I tell him and he says ""touch your toes"" so I touch my toes, and he looks at my back and says ""who told you you have scoliosis? You don't have it"" Like what the actual fuck tell that TO MY FUCKING XRAY OF THE CURVATURE IN MY LOWER BACK. Terrible doctor, he dismissed every problem I had. So once again, the doctors that think they're helping us by not giving us the medicine we need are pushing us to seek alternatives. I lost my insurance and literally had HUNDREDS of xanax left cause I rarely took em, and when I ran out no withdrawals or anything cause I never let myself get hooked. I need to get a job so I can't take xanax or opioids which I have my mom holding onto both of for me, luckily I came up on real bars and I only take an 1/8th of one for anxiety so I got a couple scripts worth for after I get a job. I decided I needed something in the meantime cause I cant live with that anxiety that's being exacerbated by PAWS, so I looked up where In my town there's kratom. Went to a smoke shop but they closed an hour earlier than google said, so I went to my smoke shop I used to always go to and they had some for WAAAYYYY cheaper. So yesterday I began using kratom, took around 4 mg first time expecting an opioid high, but first time it felt more like a benadryl and weed high. Got super hungry, and after munching out I felt great. No anxiety, no pain, actually happy for a change and optimistic about the future. Felt like I could actually get work done, where beforehand a shower felt like a chore and I love my hot showers. Took some again today cause I have alot of work to do, and it felt more like an opioid high taken on an empty stomach this time. & as I was typing this I got a call back for a job :) shits looking up.",1556570392.0

I never ask him directly to up my meds but I have had the most severe Lupus flare I have ever had this month, which landed me in the ER because I was scared because exposure to sun made my face become extremely inflamed and blistery all over, even with sunscreen on, it was horrific and painful and wasn‚Äôt going away, instead it was getting much worse. I did not ask for any pain meds at all and wasn‚Äôt given any either because I always disclose my pain contract... I was given a very high dose of prednisone (a very strong steroid for inflammation) which has awful side effects. When I go this month I am going to talk to my doctor about adding something stronger during the times I have these flares. Not only do I have Lupus, but I have Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis in every space in my lower spine (the mid and upper spine have yet to be checked), herniated discs, severe sciatica, neuropathy, bursitis in both hips, carpal tunnel, bony cysts on my right wrist and heels of my feet, IBS, varicose veins behind my knees that after standing for any length of time are extremely painful... and more. Not sure what to ask him to do... maybe for 10 or so pills of something stronger in addition to the 10mg, 4 a day Oxy I get and have been on for years and really, that dose no longer works for me. The history behind my dosage... prior to pain management my original Dr. that discovered my Lupus put me on regular opiate scripts... started on hydro, then Percocet, then worked my way up over time to 30mg Oxy, which I requested to go back down to 20mg because I felt it was too much at the time (like an idiot lol)... but at 20mg 4 times a day, I had the flexibility to take half of one when I needed to and a whole one when I needed to and if I was having a really bad pain day, I could take one and a half. My doctor was aware of how I was dosing out my meds and felt this was a good way for me to manage my pain and it worked. I was also on 30mg MS Contin 2x a day. Then she left the practice due to health problems of her own and the man who I saw instead dropped me straight down to 5mg Oxy, 3 times a day, along with the MS Contin but down to 15mg.... I was in shock, sitting silently in tears. Then the next month after seeing me hysterically crying he put me on 10 mgs 2x a day and 15mg MS Contin 2x  a day. He explained that the DEA was watching doctors closely and he couldn‚Äôt prescribe more, that I would need pain management but every referral he put through was denied by my insurance. Later, I was told by my insurance company that it was because his office was sending zero information along with the requests which is why it kept getting denied... so I spoke at length to the assistant that handled the referrals and told her why the denials were happening to which she replied ‚Äúwell I wasn‚Äôt in the room with him (during my appt) so I didn‚Äôt know to include all of this on the referral‚Äù.... like WTF!!! I was miserable (that word feels like an understatement), then I was finally referred to pain management (and with the list of my issues and diagnoses) after about a year and a half of suffering with next to no pain relief, I finally got an appt. I barely made it, truthfully. Barely. (If not for my kids who need me and I love more than my own life,  I would have felt there was no reason to live at all). Before pain management, I had some old meds I had saved over the years that I would take when I was really desperate but it was never enough or consistent and I had to save those for the really SEVERE days. Once at pain management, the Dr. took away the MS Contin altogether and put me on 10 mg Oxy 4x s day (instead of 2) as well as Gabapentin. It doesn‚Äôt give me the relief I need to live a semi-active life. I‚Äôve only been there for four months now. Next week will be my 5th appt. When I take 2 (10s) at a time, I feel like a person again, I still have pain, but I can do so much more and it‚Äôs so much better for my children and my family. Sometimes it takes 3 (10s) for that to work. The last two weeks with this awful and incredibly painful Lupus flare I have barely been able to get out of bed. I hate to feel so helpless and like many of you, I am so afraid to ask for the Dr. to give me what I know works for fear of being labeled a drug seeker and losing the meds I do get. Then I would have no good days and that is no way to live. I want to feel comfortable asking for the meds/dosing that I know works well for me... I want to ask without fear... but we all know that‚Äôs impossible. I‚Äôm going to do it though. Not directly. But I‚Äôm going to ask him to please make sure I‚Äôm covered during the times my flares get out of control because I can‚Äôt live like this. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how I‚Äôm going to go about it... but I will figure it out. I need to be able to care for my kids in the way they deserve, even with my limping around the house, believe me, I do take care of them very well, but it is so excruciatingly painful that by the time it is my time to rest and go to bed I‚Äôm writhing in pain and can‚Äôt sleep... just to barely get any sleep and start the cycle all over again. I take extra meds when I shouldn‚Äôt because then I‚Äôll run out early... but I have no choice. I would rather have two or so good weeks than four miserable ones. So I save just enough so that I don‚Äôt go through severe W/D because that would likely put me in the hospital. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I am a caregiver for two of my children through a state program where they get hundreds of hours each and I get paid so they can live in home and not in a facility since caring for them I had to stop working. I gave up my dream, my career, working in creative at a major motion picture studio in marketing. I finally broke down and found someone I trust to hire to help me care for them so this program can pay so many hours a week for each child to this other caregiver to take some of the pressure off of me. I finally found someone I trust and just had her added officially as a provider for them. I‚Äôm a hands on Mama and I love my kids more than my own life so I don‚Äôt get to take care of my health as much as I should. This is what this opioid epidemic has done to people like me. I have never been a depressed or anxiety ridden person, but now I‚Äôm a mess. I just want to feel my age, and not feel like an 80 year old woman trying to live a 40 year olds life (I‚Äôm in my early 40s). I have four kids total, one is 25, I had him at 17 and my other children are 15 (the oldest child and 4 the youngest). All three are disabled. 2 with autism (both require 24 hr protective supervision) the youngest one has an auto inflammatory disease that is so painful and causes high fevers and he is sick more than half the month. I‚Äôm in a fucking nightmare. And I have to be afraid to ask my Dr. for help. It‚Äôs just crazy. Sorry for the long post, I just had to get this off my chest I guess. I didn‚Äôt intend to go into all this but it just came out. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. ‚ù§Ô∏è (I think I will post this in r/chronicpain too).",1556509132.0

I genuinely want off. I can‚Äôt explain the cycle I‚Äôm sure you can relate it‚Äôs like I tell myself to dose so I don‚Äôt wanna KMS and need to be calm around my family as not to traumatize anyone. 

I took my last dose at like 3am and just now took another dose I didn‚Äôt plan to take until 1am Tuesday. I fuxksd up. I saw something and freaked out and was being loud and violent and my baby was crying and I took my whole dose without thinking and then went and took another 30$ worth of another drug I couldn‚Äôt afford to use until a special occasion so I feel like I huge pos. The dr says I‚Äôm dependant if I get physically sick without. I worry it‚Äôs worse that without the opiate I cannot even tolerate to myself and cannot cobtirl myself and hurt those I love most. I am high now watching a movie but I know it‚Äôs going to wear off in like 2.5 hour and I do worry about my thoughts 

Anyone wanna chat or anything? There‚Äôs an addiction and withdrawal place in town that‚Äôs only open tomorrow morn and it‚Äôs freee so I‚Äôm thinking maybe I bust down a morphine or take some oc and smoke the rest of my hash and try and sleep and wake up to cofeee and weed and feed my family and off I go to meet my maker 

Fml, 10 years ago I went through this and am technically on pharmaceutical that I try and get off always and I worry this will just fuck my life even more. Hence my will.

I didn't have any sort of prescription or doctor's note or anything stating or implying that these subs were rightfully mine. 1 of them also remained amognst my possessions as I was released the following morning. None of the 5 officers on scene mentioned the subs to me in any capacity at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was arrested a few months back, and the cops didn't do or say anything about the three 8 mg suboxone stips that I had on me, still in their packaging. This was in the sourthern U.S. Basically the scenario was that me and a buddy were parked somewhere and the cops rolled up on us and we got caught with ice, dope, ice pipe, and syringes/spoons/cottons etc. After the preliminary search, but before the deep dive began, the officer pulled me aside and asked me if there was anything in particular amongst my belongings that I wanted to come clean about before they were searched, and that if I was hones that it would go a lont ways towards helping me out legally. This was after a few things had been found in the center console and the sides of the doors, but beyond that the vehicle hadn't yet been searched. We'd also been handcuffed and sat down at this point.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I opted to go ahead and not say shit and just let what come may. They ended up finding 3 8 mg suboxone strips in my wallet which was in my backpack in the front passenger seat where I was sitting. It was very clearly my wallet, and had my ID in it and was on the side that I was sitting in. My friend was being very combative and a dick and I was being the opposite which went a long way towards helping me. Because of this he ended up catching a possession charge and I only got a paraphinalia and was let go the next morning without even needing to post any sort of bail or anything. I originally thought this was why I wasn't charged or even questioned about the suboxone, but upon thinking more about it, there were around 5 cops on scene by the end of all of this, and the one that I saw with my wallet and all of its contents spread on top of the vehicle was not the original officer that pulled us over and everything, so I don't think my friend's negative attitude and my positive one had anything to do with that particular officer's handling of stuff, since he arrived on scene later. Also, the officer did tell me explicitly that the reason I was getting a paraphanalia charge was because the vehicle was not mine, and that the only actual drugs were found amongst his belongings while only spoons, cottons, and used needles were found on my side. BUT, the subs that were clearly in my wallet goes against this completely. He did however state, after I admitted to hiding the paraphanalia, that he only charged me with paraphanalia which is a misdemeanor when he could've charged me with tampering with evidence, which is a felony. This was supposedly in response to my admission of hiding shit, as well as me just generally being chill and respectful while my friend was cussing and talking shit to the officers and being condescending back at them.

&#x200B;

Finally, 1 of the 3 sub strips was still in my belongings upon being released from jail the next morning. My wallet, and everything in it had been placed in big freezer bag type thing and the suboxone package was just sitting there clear as day amongst my credit cards and IDs and stuff. The other two were placed in evidence I imagine. So does anyone have any speculation as to why I wasn't charged with having these subs? Even if it was because of my cooperative nature, I would thinkt hat the officer would mention them to me, especially considering I specifically lied to him and failed to reveal that they were in my possession when he gave me the opportunity to do so prior to beginning the search. Any ideas or anyone been in similar situation? Thanks guys

&#x200B;

since my then 18 year old self got addicted to Heroin almost 5 years ago, my Life has become a nightmare full of tinfoil, needles, enemys and false friends. Did alot of stuff I shouldn't do to feed this expensive habit. Had a clean beautiful Flat full of Life and Art. Alot of Friends came over and we party.

&#x200B;

Now my Flat looks like a dumpster. I'm trying to get help but because my physical dependance is pretty high I wanna get Substitution from a Doc. I met mine last Thursday but since my insurance is private because of my Dad, I had to tell him about my problem. This was a big shock and also a big relief for me and him. I hope the insurance will take over the costs because if not I'm doomed to roam the streets of the Trainstation.

&#x200B;

If I piss someone off because I exist, I'm sorry, just needed to tell someone..

After accepting the risks involved, I took 25mg and had a great first experience. It made me feel extremely numb and extremely euphoric/happy for about 2 hours before I fell asleep. It was awesome.

2nd and third times, I took 35 and 40mg, respectively. Just itching and sedation were all I got. 

Up to this point, all these were done at night at my house. I would take them and then about an hour later smoke a bowl and go lay on top of my bed. 

The next time, I tried 15mg and a joint right before a country music show, and it was lit AF. 40mg later that night didn't do shit except knock my ass out.

Next week, I did a total of 55mg. 40 and then another 15 an hour later. Just felt fucked up, that was it. 

Two weeks later, I did 20mg at my buddy's house and smoked a bowl. Fucking awesome!

A day later, did 35mg. Same as when I did 55. 

To be careful, I'm spacing all these out. Last night, after a week of abstaining, I did 25mg and it was extremely close to my first experience with the stuff.

Risk of addiction aside, am I on to something here? I seem to get more high with smaller amounts. Or is it that I just can't recognize being higher than at that level because I'm still new to it all?

Update: I took 30mg and 4 hits of weed this time; that seems to be the perfect amount for me to get high. I'll cut down on my use and give it the respect it deserves.",1556474459.0

Than I started morphine, and same thing, for a year I used it once a week and it was amazing

But unfortunately I had a really bad time in my life at some point and started using morphine daily, obviously my tolerance went up and I started getting addicted, I've been addicted to it for a year now,  and the high isn't even close to what I used to feel during the 3 years I took opiates once a week

I'd really like to feel this amazing feeling again, but once your tolerance went up, it's impossible to feel this again right ? I think 7 months ago I couldn't take any opiates for an entire months, I used kratom instead, and when I used morphine again after this one month without it, it gave me a high similar to the one I had back in the days

Do you guys think if I try again to stop opiates for one or two months there is a chance I could have this feeling again when I restart using ? I wish I could just go back to using once a week like before, but it's really hard to resist",1556463176.0

I guess I just want to know what peoples experience has been with this and whether you all think it would be a bad idea to tell them to limit the suboxone, since I worry that will only delay more withdrawal symtoms after the short stint of the use of bupe, another opiate with a long half life.

Which is extremely frustrating because in the past they were giving people mouth swabs that were showing up negative for everyone....when it first happened, they made me feel like shit and cut my script to two weeks, and I had to find out they had weak tests through every other patient. They didn't even have the decency to say sorry and tell me what happened. 

Also, about a year after I went there....my DR randomly started flipping that I had benzos in my system, even though he knows I was prescribed them for many years....and I had been testing positive since day 1. Well turns out he told one of his Oxy patients its fine if he takes Klonopin (I literally take 1mg a day). When this happened he tried saying I take little peices of meds and spit throw the rest out and screamed ""You either find another suboxone DR or you have to goto rehab!"" Well anyways I stopped taking the klonopin that following month and my blood pressure went through the roof, ....all for them to not even say anything about it ever again. 

There's alot of other little things too and for the most part the past couple years have been pretty smooth. Now this shit. I'm so sick of my month being ruined because I don't know if they're gonna kick me off the program. Its very convenient too cause hes like 2 mins away from where I live. I enjoy going there, but Im getting so frustrated when they pull this bullshit, I can't enjoy anything cause I feel one day I'm gonna go in and boom! Your gone...... Even though he's asked me twice ""how long do you think you should be on Sub?"" And I said my whole life at this point....and he answered ""RIGHT ANSWER!"" Both times.

I've been there since January 2015, I always pay, I never miss my appointment....if I do I always rescedule the following day. I gave him a 5 star review on google, which in his case is a favor from me cause so many people have left reviews about his office being unprofessional and a pill mill. 

So anyways, do you guys think they are gonna drop me and I'll have to find a new DR??? Im hoping this is just something they do every year to make sure we're on our best behavior. Plus theres always appointments when hes not there, and it's ""heres your script""...see ya. Thats the way I like it. Ive been on subs since 2011, I dont think I need any guidance for it.

1. Wash my hands and injection site with antibacterial soap.

2. Draw fresh bottled water into clean rig.

3. Mix heroin into bottle cap from freshly opened water

4. Drop cotton from a qtip

5. Mix with plunger from rig. No heat

6. Shoot up.

&nbsp;


1) Waiting in Cliff's unheated rodent infested apartment from midnight to 4:30 AM so that I could bike to the ATM with his card and retrieve ~~his~~ his mom's SSI money so that Cliff could pay back a debt to me. Sometimes he'd front me but usually because I was getting paid in two days anyway.


&nbsp;

2) Waiting after 5:00 AM for Derek to come back from his plug. Anticipating arrival, hearing negotiations like Derek saying ""I wanna go home first and get straight... I'm walking all this distance to get the stuff so I should be able to do that."" Problem is that Derek was always skimming off the top or the side. Cliff of course was always trying to be cheap about what he gives Derek for his middling effort so I can't hate Derek for skimming off the top. 


&nbsp;

3) Thos times toward the end when I went directly through Derek. It was better in some regard than dealing with Cliff and Derek because if Cliff had no dope, I couldn't just use his middling services and not loan him anything until his pay day. So basically I would get half of what I paid for on the day I paid for it and have to wait for the rest. Going through Derek prevented this but also meant that Derek could get away with shit [like mixing my dope with seasoning](https://redd.it/8sn777).


&nbsp;

4) Every time Derek made it sound like he took nothing off the top. Like on my birthday, ""I didn't take anything from this batch because it's your birthday."" Of course he didn't take any bags, he jsut took some out of each bag. I don't think it's fair for him to get nothing but by telling me he took nothing when he did is obviosuly dishonest and leaves it up in the air as to how much he took.... how much lactose powder he mixed with my batch. Gosh, how many nasal infections did I get as a result of stupid ass fillers.


&nbsp;


5) The extra salty batches of heroin I got from Derek. Probably was salt. The fact that I was willing to put a mystery powder in my noise because it's all I had in order to get ""well and a bit high.


&nbsp;

6) When you can't afford enough dope to get high and stay well; in these situations I would just stretch the supply. I was proud of myself at times, making a half oxy get me through a six hour shift by taking it orally or simply dividing up my dope.

&nbsp;

7) Two wasted birthdays. Spent the money on dope.... excitedly awaited birthday money and then spent it on drugs. I don't feel super shitty about it because of the biological urge but I don't feel super proud either. My last birthday on heroin was declared my last because I knew I'd end up dead with a needle, using a needle for life or in a more awkward spot with family and friends.

&nbsp;

8) The bad lighting. I don't know how to describe it exactly, I just remember that if I was in WD, especially if I was withdrawing from a batch of fent-mixed dope, the lighting at work would jsut look strange. Light in color yet dark and harsh. It was a hard transition going from the sunny outside to the dark inside. Riding my bike actually helped a bit but nothing can make you feel better in fent WD when you are in customer service.


Those work days when I tried my darndest to get something before work, but because I Was stupid enough to trust someone like Cliff I was left hanging dry. 

&nbsp;

9) Counting on a ""sure thing"" when the only thing that was high in probability was the odds that something would go wrong. One time my running partner Cliff told me that I ""jynx"" things in a sense and how annoying it was how I worried. I think at least half the time that my worrisome attitude annoyed him was for the same reason he'd scream ""obviously not"" when his mom would scream from her bed ""did the bookie drop off the money?""


From the moment Cliff's mom saw that the money was missing to the time she pestered him to recoup her loss... Cliff knew he had no plan of paying tha money back. He was counting on her not noticing it in the first place. 

&nbsp;

10) Surprise requests for loans of dope. Unlike Cliff, Tim was usually as honeset as possible but he was a victim of circumstance. Like one time he bought dope from his Dboy's ""cousin"" and the guy owed him half a bundle. Time was gonna pay me back a debt with that but the ""cousin"" wasn't the usual guy so whenver he saw the usual guy he'd try to ask about that owed half and he'd be like ""my cousin's business is between you and himm.. we roll separately"" yet they were business partners at the same time.

As it turns out, Tim owed one of them oeny and this tricked to screw my plans up. Tim took care of me a week later, but that was five days after I ran out of dope.


Basically, I'd be looking forward to buying two whole bundles of dope and being able to get high and enjoy the first night only to go home with one bundle and desperate hope.


&nbsp; 


**Bonus:**


* Waiting on the sub connect. 


* Paying for subs in advanced to make things ""easier"" and then not having money to get subs from someone else who actually has them up front.


* That time Cliff was like ""I been in contact with my sister, her friend Laurene will have the subs Friday."" 


* ""Let's enjoy the day, get high and party and then in a couple of days we can worry about getting the subs.""


* Cliff conveniently convincing me that he couldn't get subs all of a sudden and us getting short-lived dope instead. Since I had to loan him half, well it got 1/20th the mileage of subs.


* 15 degrees F bike ride to the ATM.



* Rushing on a 5-mile bike ride before I even begin my bike ride to work just so I can get some dope and get straight.


* One time Cliff did help me in that he texted the guy who owed me two subs and was like ""Sloan is gonna be mad sick at work tomorrow if he don't get those subs you owe him -- he dont' hurt nobody...."" He pleaded on my behalf (or so he said) and at least reminded the guy to the point that he did show up with the cirtrusy-sweet wellness strip.


* My mom and Cliff's mom. I would not have gone down this road if my mom was alive, I knew she'd catch me and I would have hell to pay. She used to accuse me of being on drugs preemptively when I wasn't. So, if I was really on drugs.. well fuck. lol

I'm prescribed hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 4mg for breakthrough pain, but the pill form is shockingly weak to me. Maybe bioavailability is weak? I'm quite tolerant and am on daily hydrocodone 10mg q 6 too.

Eventually I want to drop down to Tramadol because I can manage my daily pain on it and save myself some risk, however I would keep the Dilaudid for breakthrough pain, particularly active urinary tract infections.

How can I alternatively take the Dilaudid which increases the effect so that I can get the best pain relief out of as few pills as possible? Can you mix it with water and inject it (preferably intramuscularly)? I know that's not the smartest and most ideal solution, but this would be a once in a blue moon kind of thing so I'm willing to do what it takes to get the most relief.

Any information is greatly appreciated! Also, is anyone else here managed on daily Tramadol? Does it help you? I'm worried that it's slightly too weak for my daily pain, but I'm trying it either way. Eventually I want to try Nucynta which is a little stronger which is ideal.",1556336735.0

He lives in some shady apartments in a bad part of town and this was the first time he ever asked me to meet him there. I was uncomfortable with it and asked him if he could meet me at the gas station about a half mile away on a main road where I wouldn‚Äôt look so shady. He said no, his girl had his car and it would be straight.

It‚Äôs worth mentioning I drive a nice car, nice enough to where it looks very weird in the parking lot of a complex like the one I was at. After I parked I turned off the lights but my car leaves the running lights on regardless. Didn‚Äôt want to turn the car off in case I needed to get out quick. While I‚Äôm waiting a grey Chevy equinox with blacked out windows backs in a few spots to the right of me and the cars turns off. No one gets out.

This should have set off alarms in my head, American made car, late model, tinted windows. In hindsight it screamed undercover. But in my semi dope sick state I thought little of it, probably someone else looking to score. My dude calls me and said he‚Äôs looking for my car, I back up a bit so he can see where I am in the lot, while on the phone I mention the car next to me and suggest we take a cruise for a minute and circle back. He says no he‚Äôs gotta meet his girl.

So my dude hops in my car. He hands me the dope, two balls that make up a G, not in a bag or anything. I place the two balls on my car‚Äôs wireless charging pad above the cup holders for safe keeping. This is important. We talk for a sec, pay him, and he goes to open the door. As soon as the door is cracked a big cop yanks it open and starts yelling. I reach for the dope to eat it, throw it back, one hits the back of my throat and the second bounces off my lip and down into the crack of my seat. The most unlucky rim out of all time. Of all the skittles I‚Äôve eaten and never missed my mouth, at this all important juncture I fucking miss. 

The cop is now screaming and cuffing my dealer, he yells to his partner ‚Äúdriver is eating something!!!‚Äù In a flash his partner is on me, has me cuffed before I can protest or say a word. I‚Äôm panicking. Never been arrested. Have deadly allergies and need my epipen/inhaler which of course I hadn‚Äôt brought. Panicking serious. The original cop comes around and mentions that he saw something fall between my seat and the dash while I was trying to eat it.

My heart sinks. I‚Äôm fucked. He saw it fall and he‚Äôs going to find it. I sit there with my head hung, cuffed, as they search my car. They are yelling questions at me but I remember my lawyer telling me not to say a word if arrested not to incriminate myself so I‚Äôm silent. They yell about this and try to egg me into talking but I won‚Äôt. They are still looking in my car. I‚Äôm praying they won‚Äôt find it. I know they will. 

My dealer is freaking out. Screaming about how we‚Äôre just friends and he wasn‚Äôt selling me shit. Trying to get me to admit that I bought the dope from someone else. I say nothing. I‚Äôm sure they will find the dope ball, bring me in, charge me. My career is over.  My dog is alone at home and I‚Äôve failed him. My parents pending disappointment. Just shocked this is happening. 

At this point the two cops are conferring. The original cop is this big black dude, the second is a short white guy about my age. They had been yelling about finding heroin but they never actually showed me anything they found or stopped searching so I‚Äôm hoping they are just talking shit trying to get me to admit to something. Finally they stop searching and the second cop, white guy, tells me to get up and puts me in the front passenger seat of their car.

I‚Äôm confused. Never seen an arrest go down like this. They read the Miranda but after that it got weird. In the car he asks me how long I‚Äôve been doing heroin. I‚Äôm quiet. He asks me if I‚Äôve ever been arrested before. No. I give him my details and he checks my record. Nothing. He asks me if I have any other dealers. Silence. He asks if I will give him my cell number. Weird but I oblige and give it to him. He says ‚Äúyou know if I let you go you can never fuck with this guy again, he‚Äôs going to assume you rolled on him‚Äù my heart jumps. I realize I might have a chance at going home.

I tell him, look man I just want to go home. I don‚Äôt want to cause any trouble I will go straight home and won‚Äôt leave until work tomorrow. He says okay, text me when you get home. During this their radio called and said if you see a blue Chrysler 300 stop it. It drives by right in front of us and his partner walks out and stops it. Two more cop cars pull up moments later, one in front and one in back of the 300. Pull four occupants out and cuff them. Start pulling guns out of the car. I‚Äôm watching from the cop car I‚Äôm sitting in in shock. Finally the white cop pulls me out and sits me back on the ground by my car. He goes over to help with the guys carrying guns.

I‚Äôm sitting there for 5-10 minutes thinking holy shit am I really gonna go home? I get arrested with heroin and they are just gonna let me off? Finally the white cop comes up and uncuffs me. Tells me to go home. I get back in the car, fully in shock. They let my dealer go too. Apparently he didn‚Äôt have anything on him. I drive away scared but elated that somehow I‚Äôm not on my way to jail. About a mile from there I stop to look under my seat for the dope, maybe they never found it. Nothing. I go to get back in and there it is, sitting on the seat plain as day. I had sat on it. 

I don‚Äôt know if they never found it, somehow overlooking it just sitting on the seat. Or if they did find it, figured we weren‚Äôt worth their time over .5 and left it in my car. Both scenarios seems implausible but there it is. I go home in complete shock. I even get some of the H after all that.

I text the cop and thank him, tell him I‚Äôm home. He tells me to stay sober and stop doing stupid shit. Can‚Äôt believe it. A cop that didn‚Äôt want to fuck me over a bit of H, just wants me to get my life together. Really cool.

Scary experience but damn I got lucky. It almost seems surreal looking back on it. Like it didn‚Äôt happen, when those things happen you end up in jail or rehab, but here I am in my bed. Gotta say those were some cool cops either way. Found out from my dboy they found another .5 on him and they threw it on the ground but still didn‚Äôt arrest him. He was even more thankful because he had some serious warrants out. Might have gotten super lucky the dudes with guns got caught right in front of us. Otherwise maybe they would have had time to deal with us. Idk. 

Feel like a very lucky junkie today.",1556330096.0

So I pretended I switched to subs and everything was fine, but they didn‚Äôt really buy it. It‚Äôs also gotten a lot harder to score now without a car, so I was running out of excuses to borrow theirs.

So I finally just did it...I went to the doctor, thinking i would get a sub rx, but he gave me Lofexidine instead, which basically did nothing except help the sweats a little. I got him to give me klonipin the next day to help my arms and legs, so that was good. But otherwise I feel like i pretty much went cold turkey, but my head was so fogged up from all these medicines that the time passed relatively quickly, thank god.

So my PHYSICAL withdrawal really only lasted a day and a half, which sounds unusual to me, but I‚Äôm certainly grateful. But the mental is awful. I shot some subutex this afternoon (day 3), and it helped a little bit. But overall I‚Äôm just stuck in bed wondering what the point of getting up is. I truly love heroin...I only ever got high at night, and used low dose, functioning amounts during the day. I felt like a better person, mom, worker, girlfriend, sister...all of it. Without it I can‚Äôt find a reason to get up and do anything with myself. I don‚Äôt want to stop. I really don‚Äôt. I feel like as soon as I get myself a new car, I‚Äôm just gonna get right back on and let everyone down because I‚Äôm so mad they took the one thing away from me that ever made me feel good about life and that it‚Äôs worth living.

A little over a year ago when I had a driving job. I would get random piss test here and there. They came surprisingly rarely for a driving job, once a year at most. Needless to say I got careless over time, especially once smoking tar cAme into the picture.

I was beginning to develop a daily tar smoking habit, then I get the call from my work and it‚Äôs that time again for my piss test. It‚Äôs a Thursday I believe so and even though you‚Äôre supposed to go immediately to test, you could get away with waiting a couple days to go in if you‚Äôre schedule was busy so I gave myself probably like 4 or 5 days to cleanse the tar out of my system to figure out a plan. 

I asked another driver at my work who happens to be a major stoner, what he does for drug test. He recommends a product from the local smoke shop which he swore by and has used many times before. I figure why not if he‚Äôs passed on it then it has to work. Might I add, I also needed to substitute my urine because I had smoked weed recently as well and most likely would show positive for thc. 

So I get the product and the morning of I follow the instructions, I ended up over heating it in the microwave so it goes above the temperature needed for the test. I keep testing the temperature with one of those metal meat thermometers, sticking it in the fake piss every 5 minutes til it reads about right. It comes in a little container that hides easy and stays warm near your groin. So I feel I‚Äôm ready to go to the lab and test and off I go. 


I get to the lab and while I‚Äôm outside I check the temperature one more time and I‚Äôm good to go! I go inside and check in, take the test, pour the urine behind closed doors and the temperature is on point. Bam! Success, I leave the urine with the paperwork and skip on out of that place! Pleased with my ingenious scheme.


About a week goes by and then one morning I get a call from my work telling me I need to call the drug test company to discuss my results. I instantly freak out and play out all these scenarios in my head and figure the jig is up and they discovered the urine is fake. I‚Äôm nervous as hell and I call the lab and they tell me they will call me back.

I post up in a mall parking lot for over an hour waiting and my nerves are racked. Figured they can test for fake urine and found that‚Äôs what it was. Then I get the call from the lab technician and he wants to review my results. He tells me the urine tested positive for 6-Monoacetylmorphine, the metabolite present in heroin! I instantly go into denial and play the dumbfounded card. How could this be ?! I used fake urine from the smoke shop. He tells me I could have the sample retested but it‚Äôs going to cost me 200$ and they never come back with different results. So I accept the answer and get off the phone with them...

I let my work know what happened and luckily I was in good standing with the boss and told him I‚Äôm unsure what the positive was from and maintained heavy denial and I‚Äôm willing to do anything to keep my job. He gives me an option of attending a bunch of NA meetings and retesting in a few weeks and I‚Äôm able to return to duty. That of which I do and I continue driving...

How could this be tho? I thought for sure I had it in the bag. My theory and my former dealers theory is that tar residue sticks on the fingers for days at a time. And by touching the meat thermometer and putting it back n forth in the urine, I somehow got some of the traces from tar from my fingers and into the fake urine and that‚Äôs the only explanation behind how this all happened. 

This was Over a year and a half ago, and although I kept my job that time, I eventually got let go about 6 months later due to some poor decision making while high / trying to get high. Got fired over taking a company car to go sell a 40 sack which the dude didn‚Äôt even pay me for . Lost my decent paying in the end all due to my inability to control my tar habjt.

I hope this story serves as a cautionary tale to those always stressing about drug test and just to be super clean and cautious as to how you handle your substituted urine. You can never be too careful! 

Hope everyone has a safe weekend and makes some better choices than what I made during those times. Cheers to my opiate family !",1556311912.0

HARM REDUCTION

THE ART -
Harm Reduction is a practice that everyone should know and be educated on. Especially if you use and or know someone who use substances recreationally. Harm reduction to be effective needs to be accepted in our society and we all know that drug use is present in our communities. How can we help those who need it when all we do is judge?

Principles -
-Accepts, for better and or worse, that licit and illicit drug use is part of our world and chooses to work to minimize its harmful effects rather than simply ignore or condemn them.
-Understands drug use as a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon that encompasses a continuum of behaviors from severe abuse to total abstinence and acknowledges that some ways of using drugs are clearly safer than others.
-Establishes quality of individual and community life and well-being‚Äìnot necessarily cessation of all drug use‚Äìas the criteria for successful interventions and policies.
-Calls for the non-judgmental, non-coercive provision of services and resources to people who use drugs and the communities in which they live in order to assist them in reducing attendant harm.
-Ensures that drug users and those with a history of drug use routinely have a real voice in the creation of programs and policies designed to serve them.
-Affirms drugs users themselves as the primary agents of reducing the harms of their drug use and seeks to empower users to share information and support each other in strategies which meet their actual conditions of use.
-Recognizes that the realities of poverty, class, racism, social isolation, past trauma, sex-based discrimination and other social inequalities affect both people‚Äôs vulnerability to and capacity for effectively dealing with drug-related harm.
-Does not attempt to minimize or ignore the real and tragic harm and danger associated with licit and illicit drug use.
 (Harm Reduction Coalition)

IN DEEP -
I have experienced the disease we call addiction. It isn‚Äôt pretty, and it isn‚Äôt something easy to talk about. I have found communities online or more specifically reddit, that have listened and gave advice not just to me, but to others who are looking to be accepted. These anonymous chats have helped tremendously with harm reduction and dosages of substances as most medical officials/big pharmacy companies can‚Äôt legally test.

I will be talking about harm reduction specifically with opioids and referencing some posts on the subreddit ‚Äúr/opiates‚Äù.

        The definition of harm reduction states ‚Äúany program, organization, and legal right that aims toward safe drug use and drug practices.‚Äù. What actions are our government taking to follow this practice? Well since 1991 the only specific Government Approved programs are Sub/Methadone Clinics and Needle Exchange Organizations. Ironically these Needle Exchange organizations came out to combat the HIV/AIDs epidemic but was not even addressed 10 years later. In 2005 Drug Harm Reduction advocates were ecstatic to hear about the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs meeting, hoping change was coming to America. Abstinence-Only stayed as the official ruling with Japan and Russia siding with the United States, 17 other countries fought this ruling.

        New potential laws are being discussed on forums and even making there way to some officials who could have the power to make change. Such as, decriminalizing all overcharged nonviolent drug offenses, eliminating felony charges with personal amount cases, move away from the harsh jail-time offenses and instead implement treatment options like Out/In-Patient programs, and changing suboxone and methadone to a Over the Counter Drug, with consultation of a licensed pharmacist, to help users speed up the process or worse, sourcing ‚Äú*said*‚Äù chemicals illegally. ‚Äì (r/*)

        Naloxone is something every single person should be carrying around in todays society even if you don‚Äôt use or don‚Äôt spend time with people who do. ‚ÄúThe more naloxone out there, the better chance of someone having it when an overdose occurs.‚Äù  -(r/*). Naloxone (Evzio) is used to reverse the effects of Narcotic Drugs, Narcan is the most effective opioid overdose reversal medication, and should be administered nasally right away if symptoms of an overdose are sighted. Narcan is something our society also needs to accept and should be carried by everybody.

        In conclusion legal reform needs to be discussed. It is essential that we the people accept that drugs are in our communities, accept Harm Reduction Practices, allow less restrictions with suboxone and methadone, and of course be safe and don‚Äôt judge others.

I want to tell you about the greatest dealer I ever had and how I wish every dealer was exactly how this guy was. 

With him - you could always count on him. He had a spot that he operated from everyday and always was on time - from 1AM to 8 AM he‚Äôd be in that spot for years. Even during the times where he had nothing or was waiting to re-up, he‚Äôd bring another dealer to make sure people who came didn‚Äôt leave sick and hopeless. If he was sick or couldn‚Äôt come - he‚Äôd always have someone there with his stuff. 

Up to 6PM, he‚Äôd be only available at his house and only made deliveries if people bought enough or paid extra for delivery cost. 

He had a selection of stuff from smack to white girl powder to rock. 

With the Square App (Point of Sale App) he took gift cards, debit cards and credit cards. 

He often let you trade - you could barter with him almost anything from women‚Äôs cosmetics to bounty paper towels to headphones and cellphones. 

If you were a long client and knew you weren‚Äôt in a method one program or if you had a job he‚Äôd never leave you sick. 

He always gave credit to all his customers who had jobs. 

He got you if you were short. He‚Äôd take change if you couldn‚Äôt change them into bills. 

You could take credit from him but only to half of what you got from your paycheck. So if you made 500 he‚Äôd only give you 250 credit. 

His interest for credit was at $3 per bag. 

So if you took 2 on credit, you‚Äôd owe him $26 when your paycheck came in a week or two. 

This man was my dealer for eleven years. Yesterday he died at the hospital- still trying to find out what happened from his wife. 

I wish you guys could of dealt with this guy. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do now. Starting a relationship and getting close with another dealer won‚Äôt do justice as I‚Äôm sure he won‚Äôt even operate how this guy did.",1556263871.0

Like, if over the weekends went down 1mg or 2mg, per day, if I went to zero, would I get full withdrawl?
Or if I took it for a week, then stop. Will the withdrawl be gentler?

Other idea, is to jump off of four, on sat morning. Get stuff. No sub all weekend, cover the efects with street. Then on Monday, go to kratom.
Subs should be gone enough for the kratom to work? And let myself down gentler?

I am on methadone basically because I'm self medicating some mental health issues such as crippling social anxiety. generalized anxiety and BPD. also depression ect.. 40 mg a day and if I miss my drink one day or even a second day in a row I'm fine. even fell off the program multiple times from not making it into get my drink because it's not that much of a pressing or serious matter for myself. has anyone ever heard of this or have experienced this themselves? and yes I have binged on hydro morph 12's and mixed high doses of all kinds for days and days even weeks and never withdrawl. I can go for a month on 50 milligrams of methadone to nothing and I wake up fine, and keep waking up fine the day after and the day after that. 

when it comes right down to it, is opiate addiction psychological?

Every month I drag myself in here propped up only by the DXM I took to take the edge off my benzo, barbiturate, and amphetamine withdrawals. 


Shaking I make my way up to the counter trying to look normal.


‚ÄúYes I'd like to pick up some prescriptions for J‚Äù


I provide my birthday and last name and inevitably I'm sent to the chairs to wait. Tapping my foot to ease my restless legs I try and browse Reddit but I have no focus. Instead I look at the people around me, normal people, waiting on their antidepressants or other meds. My body fills with envy and disgust.


‚ÄúYou will never know the nirvana that lies within reach of a few extra pills.‚Äù I think.


A kid and his dad walk up to the counter and I overhear the name Percocet. I perk up as the beast within me knows all too well what it's hungry for.


But those days are behind me or so I convince myself. Knowing all too well what I would do for that 10 year olds script. Instead I remain seated eyeing the temporary cast the kid has on.


Allowing my mind to wander I remember Easter almost 7 years ago.




I was a dumbass skater punk ripping down all the hills back in my hometown. The day before Easter I crashed and broke both bones in my forearm. The doctor who reset my bones said it was a surprise to see a wrist that was as bad as mine. My bones had turned from where they should have been to opposite sides. In short, it was agony. That was until I got a bottle of 60 Percs.


Broken bones were nothing new to me and neither were the hydro and oxy scripts, but now I was in charge of my own bottle.


On the first night I took my prescribed dose of one perc 10, just enough to make the pain bearable. Finally my arm didn't feel like it had been run over, and a deep sleep came. Four hours later on the dot I woke up screaming from the couch downstairs.


The bottle was two rooms away in the kitchen cabinet, but those 20 yards may as well have been across the continent. With tears streaming down my face I pulled out my ultra cool Razer and dialed the home phone, waking the entire household.


‚ÄúMom! Please just give me two.‚Äù I pleaded and begged her.


‚ÄúI'm sorry baby but the bottle says take one every four to six hours.‚Äù She replied, bottle in hand.


‚ÄúPlease! Just two! I just want to sleep!‚Äù I cried.


Two pills appeared in my open hand, instantly I popped both and profusely thanked my mother.


As the pain faded the extra pill began to shine as any frequent chipper would expect. Mmmm the warm opiates waved over my mind, singing a sweet siren song of bliss. As much as I wanted to enjoy the high at 4am I let myself slumber away.


The next day on Easter I was starving, not for the deviled eggs or the ham, I wanted more Percocet. I took my morning dose of one and limped on, not high but not in pain. Then I began calculating my plan.


Being 18 I decided to make the most of my script early on and deal with the consequences later. Searching the medicine cabinet I found some Tylenol that looked close enough to the Percs. Replacing the Percs with Tylenol was genius in my adolescent mind.


I spent the next week strategically planning my highs, the dose, the time, who would be home, every detail. I was high as a kite, floating in the opiate ocean 4 times that week. All while I took my replacement Tylenol in case my parents got suspicious.



‚ÄúI used to be so smart‚Äù I muttered under my breath, when the pharmacist called my name.


As I left the counter I clutched my precious cargo. I walked by the kid and his dad, praying he wouldn't end up like me. Part of me wanted to say a word of caution to him, but I didn't. instead I decided to open the bag in the parking lot and chew up three Valium, four Fiorinal, and two Adderall. 


‚ÄúIt is refill day after all, one must celebrate‚Äù I said while Motley Crue blasted Live Wire. 


Five minutes later at home I lay on my bed still dreaming of the days of uninterrupted bliss, with no thoughts of the pain and cost. But none of that matters when you feel a high coming on.",1556249552.0

For some background, I have mild tolerance, in that it takes around 10mg oxy for pain relief, and above 15mg pushes into la-la land. My surgeon is currently away, so there might be a few day gap between when I can get a real script, and my pain is sucking due to a mild stumble. 

I have been taking these ORALLY to good effect without any side effects -- decent pain relief with half a pill, but definitely did not feel like the pharmacy oxy I was prescribed. I came to realize that they're probably not legit - despite appearances - so I went and tested them with with strips from dancesafe. Two different pills confirmed fent.

I have several left, which I want to continue to use to help with pain, but I'm a bit hesitant. My goal here is to help with pain and take these SAFELY. So, I was wondering what would be the *safest* route of administration would be? Again, I'm not concerned with efficacy or getting especially high -- this is just to help with pain as I work things out with my surgeon to get another legit script.

My thinking was to crush the pills, and mix with water, while measuring amounts, and then sipping X% of the water every 30 minutes or so.

Based on what I've read, this will limit the risk of any OD via hitting an unintentional hotspot, and given the bioavability of oral fent, I should be okay. I also intend to let a friend who lives in my building what I'm doing, and to text him periodically. 


TLDR - Have very legit looking MBOX 30mg pills which tested positive for fent. Want to know SAFEST way (efficacy irrelevant) to take them, as my goal is to help with pain more than anything. Proposed method is dissolving in water and sipping bit by bit.",1556248575.0

first post ever here but I'm an old lurker. Just wanted to share my story and success about quitting opiates after 4 years of daily use (began at 17yo, smoked plugged and IVed). Allthough at the end I was on methadone (75 to 100mg) for a year, I still used heroin/fent (mostly fent as I had access to a prescription) and the metha for withdrawals.

I went to a psychiatric hospital 3 times and the last one worked allthough they made me quit methadone COLD TURKEY (they gave me a shit ton of valium though, like 100mg daily). And well, as you guys know: it was worse than hell physically for freaking 2 months and then the psychologic aspect began...

I was craving opiates so much I had to start smoking weed again (was also a big addiction for me in my 15-16th, like 50g a week). But now I managed to control it to ""only"" two joints a day before bed time. I tried Kratom and loved it but at the moment I can't afford it due to my weed use.

I also forgot to mention I have crippling anxiety (diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder) and chronic depression (these started way before any drug use, allthough drugs must have surely enhanced it). 

I'm now on sertraline (zoloft) 200mg and wellbutrin 300mg daily - both for depression as it does nothing to my anxiety. It kinda works, more than any other medication anyway. I talked to my doctor about Kratom and he said he's not against it but I should be careful nonetheless. 

My doc also prescribed me xanax as my anxiety has gone up the last few months. And... it works wonders (I think I wouldn't be sharing my story if I had not taken one earlier). I'm extremely cautious about my use as I have an addictive personality. I'm aware of all the dangers and I try not to take it to often (even though it's hard as my anxiety is unbearable and it ruins my life). But since I have xan I slowly feel that I can adapt to this shitty society and I almost cried the other day because of it helping me so much. I'm starting to have friends and I'm starting to think now I could try higher education again (failed 3 times due to my anxiety/depression and drug use).

Sorry for my looong ass post. But it felt good writing it even if no one reads it. Thanks for those who did :)

Ive gotten those from her before so I put them in the baggy and went about my business.

Today I took the bag out to do one and I noticed that there is some powder residue rubbing out into the bag. That hasn‚Äôt happened to these before as far as I can remember. So I‚Äôm a little weary. So I snort one and it def burns. I don‚Äôt have the drip/taste that I am used to either. Now it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had the yellows so I‚Äôm wondering if maybe I forgot. But now I have some numbness with my drip too. 

I‚Äôm not overly high. I don‚Äôt feel like it hit me hard or anything it‚Äôs just different. Are these fent? I don‚Äôt do dope usually and I can count on one hand the times I have so I just know something is different. I also usually get energy from my pills and I‚Äôm dragging.

Once upon a time (yesterday), Ol' Papi Percocet was given a super legit primo contact from my main middle. He is a good dude, stand up guy and I think he just had enough of the crap and decided I could just deal with them. So I make contact with the new source and told to meet up 30 min from my home at 11:30. ""Please be on time! :) Then we will drive 10 minutes to go grab the stuff in ""The Cities"" The Cities are twins but one of them is ugly and old, yuck. I get to the set location at 11:25, Ol' Papi Percocet is a punctual man, ladies ;) and let her know that I am here. ""Ok, 5 min!""...so i wait, I wait some more, and wait... half hour later she comes rolling in in a car that's about to break down and die right there... "" Hey man, can you drive? I don't have any gas."" Great sign. Whatever, not like I want to drive in that POS as it is, I'll probably get Tetanus or Hep C. The middle brought her two crackhead friends as well! The more the merrier, merryer? Now, I am not bragging, just trying to paint a picture of Ol' Papi Percocet's car. It is a 2015 Audi A6 Supercharged, it is very nice, I keep it pristine and clean. It is also my family's car. It is just as much my little boy's as it is mine. He has a great set up in the back with his car seat and the extra leg room in the A6. So they need room to sit so i have to rip out the carseat and throw it in their car, yes i checked for needles sticking in it after. Immediately they crack open a window and start smoking cigarettes before I could tell them not to smoke in my son's car. Already irritated... So guess what? We have to go pick up ANOTHER person! My middle, has a fucking Middle! My Middle, his middle and her Middle... fuck my life. So we go to pick her up! Sitting waiting another half hour for this lady to walk ten feet out of her apartment to our car. So what do the little crackheads my middle brough do? Start fucking smoking Meth in my car without asking! AGGGH. The other middle is handicapped with the cane, fine. Out walks this YHUUUGE African American Lady, 5 people squeezed into the car, and a morbidly obese lady in my front see kicking the floor cause she doesn't have enough room in a full size executive car. Whatever, ill be done with these people in 10 minutes, right? WRONG! Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady has to drive back into The Cities, the nice one. To get her paycheck before anything can happen. Ol' Papi Percocet, is not a happy camper but he buckles down and starts driving, pretty much back to his house knowing he will have to drive back and drop them off. So as we are driving down, I find out the reason why we are dragging our feet is because there are another two people we are meeting up with, who were supposed to pick up Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady at 11:30 but they were late from driving from a city 3 hours away and she is fuming and ignoring their calls, so as I am driving they are blowing this up and she has her phone ringer fully on just blasting some Hardcore Rapper CONSTANTLY. Finally, she answers and just starts screaming at them, jut full on chaos and I have to listen on speaker as these other crackheads are giving every excuse in the book, begging, BEGGING, Pleading for her to help them score their dope after she said she wasn't fucking with them today. Idiots drove 3 hours to get here and couldn't fucking be on time, not my fault, not even Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady. She needed to be picked up at 11:30 to make this work for 7 people, I got her frustration, but damn, Ol' Papi Percocet's ears were hurting. We finally get downtown and Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady goes to pick up her check so I'm sitting with my Middle's Middle and the two crackheads who are begging me to let them smoke meth in my car, I guess they couldnt get out of the car and smoke it on the street. So, Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady tells us to sit put because she will be 10 minutes in and out, and I know how she is on time. So Baby Jr Crackhead as I called him decides he has to go tinkle, Dowtown, in the middle of fucking lunch hour looking like a Baby Jr Crackhead with all the business professionals walking around, so he dips cause he has got to go tinky. Fucking Idiot, SSIBL comes back out, in ten minutes and BJC isnt there, so she goes off again screaming and yelling. Just fuck my life. SSIBL explains we have to be there at a certain time or the guy is gone, Finally BJC runs back out and we start moving to go meet the out of town crackheads down the street at at a specific clear location given to them. Guess what, they arent there. SSIBL starts going ballistic again calling them, These crackheads are so lost and out of it they have no idea, all they do is plead and BEG to SSIBL about how sorry they are and what big pieces of shit they are. Just amazes me how much berating and agreement someone can take to get their dope. PLEEEAAASE, PLEAAASE SSIBL! Whatever, finally find them and we go to Northside to finally meet up with My Middle's Middle's Middle's Dude. My Middle's Middle is short and SSIBL goes off again, so she blames it on me, thanks a lot...And the wait begins again. I am like 4 hours into this thing at the end of it. We finally get it and I start the drive back and the fucking crackheads and Middle's Middle start fucking smoking the dope 3 packed in the back of my car, Now I am fucking screaming along with SSIBL. ""DUde, we are so sick....PLEEEEASE"". Not Like I'm not fucking sick, but I fucking wait because of its not suspicious in the dope capital of my state to have a nice ass car in the hood, with 3 crackhead looking white people in the back with a obese Sassy Strong Independent Black lady in the back... she was super sweet though, you know how they are. After i get all the crackheads out of my car she apologizes to me saying I have been nothing but sweet, she shorts all there bags to give me extra an then gives me an extra half.

bh98zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bh98zs/a_note_on_vivitrol_from_an_athlete_and_runner/,17,https://redd.it/bh98zs,YPG-Got-Raqqa,A note on Vivitrol from an athlete and runner.,"So I figured I would just mention my experience because I feel that the online forums about vivitrol and how it effects happiness, runners high, sex and all of that stuff is completely overtaken by people who either haven't been on viv that long or people who were forced to get viv before they were ready. 

I used daily from 18 to 23 and then spent the last five years pecking away occasionally. Eventually one of the times overdosed me and I decided I needed to get serious and got the shot. That was 8 months ago and I've gotten it monthly since then. 

When you first get sober, life is going to suck for a few months. That is true whether you are on viv or not. I feel that many people claim that viv stopped all of their happiness and all that as soon as they started taking it, but those folks hadn't been clean for six months to see how shitty you feel when you take your first opiate break in ten years. 

In my five years of chipping I had made a point of getting in shape, lifting in the winter and running in the summer. Over time I switched to mostly running half marathon distances. I run about 35 miles a week and can win most of my local 5 and 10 k races. I'm not a pro or anything but I'm a strong runner. 

When I first got on viv I felt like my running and lifting was done. Doing bench press I felt like the weight was heavier and running my legs felt like lead. I was convinced the viv did it to me. I got it in my head and hated it like crazy but I HAD to keep taking it. I have a house and a partner and pets and a god damn fantastic job that I couldn't lose. 

So I knuckled down and ran through it. I truly believe that it did have some minor negative effects in the first week, but after a few long runs, within the first two weeks, I was feeling a distinct runners high from my long runs. 

I want to repeat. As an athlete who works out 7 days a week, it does not kill the runners high. I know there will be people who are going to contradict this but I'm willing to bet that 99% of them who claim it kills the rush from running or working out were not running or working out regularly before they got on viv. They were doing dope all day. 

I say to people who want to get into fitness that you need to dedicate two months to it. 3x a week for two months is enough for your body to get used to it and for working out to switch from sucking to feeling good. 

I'm not going to say that viv will work for everyone in terms of side effects, but don't tell yourself ""I can't do it because it will kill runners high"" if you haven't gotten off your ass in the last two years. You aren't going to get runners high from anything if you aren't in shape at all. Viv is worth a shot though because if you are ready to get clean and willing to get 12 shots, it WILL WORK for you in terms of keeping you alive. I'm staying on it a few more months to continue to work out my issues but all that time I'm going to be collecting race t shirts and hardware!",1556202348.0

Then he straight up asked if I need prescription strength medication to which I replied ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here because I do believe that and I am in pain, yes.‚Äù 

He asked which meds to which I told him I would trust his judgement. He prescribed physical therapy and tramadol first. I could have probably asked for hydrocodone but he was being so cool and compassionate that I was too shocked. He asked me to go get an mri and an xray and to come back in two weeks for more medication. I will tell him the tramadol is making me sick and not helping as much with the pain which is true. 

Very happy that I think I found a good place. I would have tried pain management sooner i‚Äôd known they‚Äôd be this compassionate and my injury did warrant it.",1556198261.0

I‚Äôm thinking of transitioning because I‚Äôve been seeing threads about snorting being bad and not getting the full effect. I usually snort an amount of about 10 mills in one session, or could be more. If I transition into popping, would I get more of an effect of popping the same amount I‚Äôm snorting in sessions? For example, if I snort half a 5 mill perc, I should just pop half a 5 mill perc? Should I just pop percs and snort roxies for the snorting sensation? I think I just want that snorting sensation and the feel that‚Äôs why.",1556167361.0

Now I am in noooooo way one of those guys that think if a girl says hi to him or smiled at him thinks she‚Äôs into him. I was originally not even going to think twice about it because I figure it‚Äôs just a married chick being flirty to prove to herself she‚Äôs still got it. However.,...she just texted me like 2 minutes ago about Family Guy and the episode that‚Äôs on right now. I‚Äôve never ever gotten a text from her that wasn‚Äôt about picking up a bun. When my guy isn‚Äôt home, she handles shop so me and her talk, and I‚Äôll go in and have a cigarette with her, I‚Äôll grab my shit and go.
So this is what I‚Äôm thinking. If I flirt back hard and get her going, I think I can probably get some free bags off of her each time I pick up and my guy isn‚Äôt there. I mean I won‚Äôt press, but I‚Äôll drop hints and stuff like that.
What do u guys think? Am I going to get myself into trouble? If she gives me free shit, u think my guy would cut me off?",1556163070.0
