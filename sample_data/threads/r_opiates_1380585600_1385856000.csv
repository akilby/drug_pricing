Last night I noticed that as little as 3 hours after my last sniffed dose I started to feel uncomfortable.. I feel like that's pretty soon, and must have just been mental or something, right?

Well, anyway, I just woke up and ""got right"", and now I've got a little tiny bit of dope left (not enough to get high, but enough to stave off another bout of w/d's)... its 7:30am and I've gotta just stay well until about 3:30pm.. Any tips here on what I can do?

Is it smarter to sniff it in tiny bumps every hour or so, or just wait as long as possible then sniff it all at once, or what? 

fucking fuck.. I don't mind w/d's all that much its just I get mad at myself for letting my habit get in the way of my life.. like, I already know that just because I'm stressing about w/ding, even if I manage to make this dope stretch to keep me well till the end of today, the added stress is going to effect my exams and shit regardless.

oh well, now that I'm well I'm gunna use this time to study. I can also go get some poppy seeds to make tea, but I really wanna use all the time before my exams to study. (going to the store and all that eats up about an hour of time, and after using heroin for a little while like I have been, often times PST isn't even enough to really cut the withdrawals)

I also have some .5mg xanax. I might take one of those to help out today but I don't really wanna take more than that and be all benzoed out for my tests.

EDIT: thanks for the recommendations but the dope is gone. I sniffed the last of it around noon and by ~3pm I was definitely feeling w/ds come on, but I didn't have anywhere close to a full dose at that last dose. I'd say between 7am to noon I consumed about ~50-75mg of dope, which would normally be what I would sniff in a single session to get high.. So I guess its understandable that w/d's came on so soon.. 

Just got some poppy seeds and made 2lb worth and I feel the w/d's subsiding a bit, at least enough for me to deal with some shit I have to do.",1380627387.0

I only get black tar h, and ever time i've gotten it from a different dealer (not one single dealer ripping me). I've tried smoking it, turning it into monkey water and snorting, and turning into cheese and snorting. I have read extensively on how to smoke and snort it correctly, and am pretty sure i have been doing it relatively right.
Today, i bought a $40 ball about half the size of a marble. It smelled heavily of vinegar and looked legit. Over the last two hours i've smoked all of it, and barely gotten more than a little high. Please note that my opiate tolerance is low - i haven't used opiates in over a month until now. 
note: I've used oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, and buprenorphine. All of them get me to a pleasant place with no problems.

In fact it seems like most of the harmful effects of opiates (impurities, bank-busting prices, having to deal with sketchy people) are due to the very fact that they're illegal in the first place.

Yes, opiates carry very real dangers if abused, but if things are really spiraling out of control why not just take it down a notch? Why the need to toss them aside altogether?

Notes on low-level hydrocodone use and WD,"Hi r/opiates!   I created a little burner here to discuss some recent Norco usage, and what happened when I stopped using.    I thought it would be worthwhile since when I was running out of the drug I was worried about withdrawals but couldn't find very much information about what to expect at this level of usage.   So here are the details:

I'm a man in his mid-30s who was gifted a bottle of 60 Norcos (10mg hydrocodone/325mg acet) about five weeks ago.    I love a light hydrocodone buzz--where my body has a nice pleasant feeling like being wrapped in a warm blanket and my mood and energy level are slightly elevated.    In the past I've only used in the rare occasions I've come across them through friends who had surgery or whatever, just every once in a while indulging in hydros and occasionally a roxy, although I don't like the side effects I get from higher doses of either (I'm not one to head for the ""nod"" because I get a really shitty sleep and end up exhausted, ""hungover"" and grumpy the next day).    But with this in my cabinet I found myself indulging in a Norco or two every day for approximately five weeks.    My body weight is around 170 lbs, and I was taking 10mg in the beginning which worked up to 15-20mg most days by the end, at the end of the day after I got home from work.   I'd also drink a glass of wine or two.  A couple of Sundays I also took one during the day to watch football.    I was concerned that this level of usage, though light, would still result in some uncomfortable withdrawal.   But my last dose was Friday evening (took my last 30mg) and I've had no noticeable effects from stopping since then apart from a bit of a depressed mood and a little trouble sleeping that was easily remedied with an OTC medication.   Today (Monday) I'm feeling better, in fact more clear-headed and optimistic than I have in a while.     

In conclusion, it seems that low doses of hydrocodone taken once a day (in the evenings) for around a month don't necessarily result in withdrawals for a person of my age and size.     

Incidentally, I don't feel compelled to search for more at this point although if my connect came through with another bottle I wouldn't argue it.   Right now I'm happy to be taking a break.

Peace and love to everyone.",1380566121.0

I go to a state school in the middle of the country and study religion (buddhism & christianity)and physics, but am taking break as I just got out of rehab two weeks ago (had a bad iv habit for five years)
 I understand that it's probably not the best idea to browse this sub but I missed it. I'm sober at the moment with subs (actually sober six months yesterday) .My goal for now is to stay on subs til I get into grad school and then see how I feel.  At this point for me making the decision to never use again was to much for me emotionally, to where it was pretty much counter productive. I honestly don't know if I'll use again, I'm not sure any addict can say that . 
    I get a lot of shit for saying this, but having all you can use for an extended period of time gets depressing. Maybe someone smarter could do it.In the old days picking up was awesome, despite the uncertainty, and all the bullshit dboys, it actually felt like doing something. 
After a year of that it kinda morphed into a routine where I would go to a hotel, sleep and watch any real house wives shows, pretend to speech  spanish for a bit and then leave.  And yes, many of you have valid points on why I'm a spoiled little bitch and yea you are kinda right, I blame it on my Jew powers. But for me really feeling that good all the time, or even the majority of the time, makes doing things that make me feel good pointless, and unfortunately doing things with people makes much better memories than putting a needle in your aim and spending laughable amounts of hours in hotel room anxious as hell,with people who don't speak English (Thank god for fifa) :(life sucks, hope you guys are having a wonderful night.

Long time lurker, I suppose I should introduce myself","As I said in the title, I've been lurking this sub for quite some time now. A little background about myself. I'm 22 and I am a female. That's all you get. Finally wanted to make a post, so I've created my personal throwaway. 

My whole life I told myself, heroin is the one drug I will stay away from. I'll smoke weed all day and dabble with other drugs but you will never catch me with H. I started dating my boyfriend about a year ago who was an ex H addict of 4 years followed by another 5 years of Methadone. I have heard horror stories of his w/d and that seemed to only persuade me of staying away. He has been clean from methadone for 2 years now.I didn't get into painkillers until I met him either. I messed my back up about a year ago and had pretty easy access...at first.

Then the dreams started. I had repeated dreams of shooting h and although I've had these dreams before, I never felt the high in my dream until that day. How is it possible to feel a high that you've never experienced? The dreams continued for a month. My birthday comes around and I planned on getting some sort of opiate painkillers. The stress of the whole day trying to get them and having people flake was awful. I was so anxious I almost felt sick. That was when I suggested it to my boyfriend that I wanted to try it. The main reason that I hesitated is I would never forgive myself if he got back on it again. He has developed an enormous amount of self-control to where he can just dabble. 

The next day we drove 2 hours to another city to meet someone he knew. We spent 3 hours driving to the dealer in the city including bullshitting and all of that. And finally another 2 hours back home. 7 hours driving on my birthday wasn't exactly my plan. But we got it. And the drive home felt longer than ever. I wanted to shoot it but we had trouble finding rigs. So I snorted it. I know I have a fairly weak stomach, but I am not exaggerating when I tell you I puked about 20 times. The high was amazing. I experienced something that I have been craving for so long. I tried it again yesterday and smoked it and still had an amazing night.

My question for you guys. Is there anything I should know/watch out for? Like I said my boyfriend has years of experience of using but if there is anything else, I'm sure I'm in the right place. 
I'm not saying any of you will, but please save any judgment about my boyfriend doing it again, and any judgment about trying to stop me. My mind has been made. 

Nice meeting all of you, I recognize many of your usernames from posts so I would be pretty excited to see them here!

It's been crazy, and because of the insane prices for everything here ($35 for a roxy, $25-30 for a fat tenth of shitty dope or a skimpy tenth of good dope), i cannot afford this habit anymore. It was so easy to justify my habit when $35 would have me good all day and $70 would get me nodding, but lately i've had a few days when i've spent $100+ and have been stone sober at the end of the day. So i'm getting a $400 check on thursday, and i'm gonna try and catch one good nod and then im gonna quit. I should mention that i do not IV and i know that would help me buy less dope but i really don't want to turn that corner cause i know i would love it and I have made it this long without anyone in my family knowing about my habit, i need to keep it that way.

My question is how long do i need to quit to really lower my tolerance? I haven't gone longer than a week in 2 years now and i havent even gone a full day in over 2 months.

Well anyways, said girlfriend, buys from a new dude, cooks it up and injects what she thinks is heroin. Turns out its that powder bleach. Her and her baby die instantly. Dude finds out in rehab, freaks the fuck out, leaves, and hangs himself that day.

I've been lurking on this sub for a while (just made this throwaway account though) and have been doing opiates for a little over 2 years. So anyways, today around noon or so I picked up some h (usually oc is my DOC) and snorted it. It was probably the best high I've gotten from h. So an hour or two goes by and I do a few more smaller bumps. After those bumps settle in, I'm fuckin flyiiinn high. I actually have a 30 minute drive home (I know, i shouldn't be driving. Sorry.) and that's when I actually start to get a little worried. I had to pull over because I'm just nodding too fucking hard. So after I take a 30 min rest pulled over, I finally make it home and cook dinner for my family. As soon as I finished though, I went upstairs and had to just lay down and passed out for a little. I was so fucked up though, and then maybe about 6 hours ago is when I woke up feeling like a train hit me, my head was pounding, and I actually threw up. I hadn't had much to eat throughout the day, so I really only threw up the soda that I had drank....this has been lasting the entire night.

So i've been expecting a $350 check in the mail for a week now, and im otherwise broke and sick today and wouldn't you know it, it's not here. But that's not the point of the story, i still managed to make some money happen enough to get myself a 30 so i decided to hit up my main dude. 

A little backstory: i've always had a hard time keeping connects. For the longest time i was reliant on middlemen, which as i'm sure you guys know can really suck. If i ever did get a direct connect they would inevitably get busted or go to rehab after a few months at most. A few weeks ago I met ""james"" through a buddy of mine, and WOW this guy was the best dealer you could imagine. ALWAYS good, ALWAYS home, ALWAYS answered the phone, and within 15 minutes of hitting him up you were high. Just the best dealer by far i've ever had. 

So today I get off work early with my money for just one 30 but im sick so one 30 is definitely better than nothing, but i only have about 1 hour to work with before i have to meet my parents for dinner. So i hit up james, and he doesnt answer. This is strange cause like i said he ALWAYS answers so i text him, no response. I let 15 minutes go by and he doesnt answer so i call another guy, he says yeah come on thru. So when i get there he says ""hey man can you give me a ride down the road"" and im like....fuck.....sure. Turns out he doesnt even have anything on him and i have to drive him to go re-up. That sucks but he says he'll knock $5 off the price for the drive and i dont really have any other options as james still hasnt hit me back so he gets in the car and we go. Well its turns out, we fucking end up going to james'. My other dude is getting his re-up off of him. I'm like ""what the fuck"" but i dont really care cause i just saved $5 and im getting high anyway. So we leave james' and i drop off my other dude, happy that everything worked out with time to spare. Then i get a text from james that says ""Lol how you gonna go thru someone else but pull up in my driveway?"" and i think he's just kidding and I say ""bro i hit u up, way before i hit him up"". This motherfucker responds with ""yeah well just hit him up from now on."" I'm like NOOOOOOOO cause this other guy is flaky at best and a known thief and like i said james is amazing and I am heartbroken. I say ""bro i tried to hit you up, you didnt answer. i had no idea he was gonna have me go to your house until we got there. what was i supposed to do? give me a another chance man it won't happen again"" and he doesn't respond for about 30 minutes and then just says ""holla at you bro"", whatever that means.

So I'm fucking pissed right now. I didn't do anything wrong, he didnt answer the phone and STILL TECHNICALLY MADE MONEY OFF OF ME and now he's pissed at me and i guess won't sell to me anymore. I didnt ask him to clarify that last text cause i don't want to piss him off and i'll just try to plead with him next time i'm trying to score. But i mean what the fuck, have you guys ever had any bullshit like this happen before? what did he want me to do, just not get anything? He always answers the phone but didn't today so i assumed he was out or was busy, and I totally fucked myself and can't believe how it happened. Talk to me reddit.",1380849488.0

What's a good way to bring up the subject? Is it taboo to just say, ""here's my problem, is there some way we could deal with that?""

Also I don't want something with APAP. I don't want to sound too knowledgeable and choosy, though. Would it be okay to just say (truthfully) that Tylenol does nothing for me, hydrocodone did nothing for me after surgery, and that I would prefer a less complicated/toxic medicine?

Now, I'm sure you've also had the dreaded result of the plunger has pushed down. Sure, you can tap the cap/wash it, but you'll prob still losing some. Not to mention that the cap can come off and you'll just straight up lose it.

 
  Really shitty situation. Sure, it can be avoided by not saivng shots, but sometimes it is just easier to do that. During the day I'll cook up my shots to 50-60 units. I'll squirt out 10 units of each shot and save that for my morning shot. Just makes it easier for me. I also have a method to not have the bastard squirt out on you!

**actual steps for doing this below**

 So, what I do is I take an empty needle and pull the plunger back to the 70 unit marker. Then, I take a lighter to the end of the rig and then bend the plunger. I bend it so it ends up making a U and is flush with the outside of the rig. Then I add heat again and melt it so I can discard the rest of the plunger. 

I don't have a camera so I drew a picture. It isn't the best, but I feel like with my explanation you'll def see what I'm talking about.

http://i.imgur.com/N3dTzzV.png

bam. 

When you want to do the shot you just remove the plunger, put the needle in the rig you will use, insert new plunger, and complete the back loading.

When I have an episode and my bpd kicks in on top of that I *must* be on drugs because it's not possible for me to have any personality/mental disorders  For some reason my dad brought this up when nobody else was around and said I must be really super duper high on something today  because my face is doing ""that thing""...seriously man...me having an episode or my Tourettes acting up is code for super high, right?   
  
I ended up trying to have a conversation with him about this when he brought it up again earlier...sometimes I can't tell whether he's serious, and believes all of my brother's bullshit, or he's messing with me....either way, it just makes the stress and makes my tics worse.

so i go down turn and head back toward the freeway when the car coming toward me gets whooped and I figure the cop is occupied so I just drive past him cool as a cucumber and head to the highway. it was an unmarked silver charger by the way. no lights or markings. so if you cop on the east side of cleveland watch out.

I check my mirrors and he isn't coming after us so I calm down.

I'm just about to turn onto the freeway when we get lit up.  don't know how he snuck up on my because I am ALWAYS super aware of my surroundings when driving and am checking my mirrors constantly. I must have been slightly buzzed.  after all I just booted up.  just to be clear I was absolutely ok to drive.  I do this daily and don't get wasted off a 20 split between two people. just well.

they were vice detectives by the way. same car that had pulled that other guy over.  he let him go and came after me.

so he and his partner come up and he's like whats going on here and of course two white people have no reason to be in the hood other than to cop dope.  i tell him we were visiting a friend, he asks who, i give a name.  he's not buying it.

he starts on ""where is the dope where is the heroin?""

I'm like I don't have any heroin sir which wasn't even a lie it was gone.

his partner orders her out the car.  he grabs the keys out of the ignition and orders me out of the car and cuffs me. 

his partner finds her (loaded with a wash) rig and WHY THE FUCK DIDN'T SHE SQUIRT THAT SHIT ON THE FLOOR WHEN THE LIGHTS HIT US UGHGHG.

I had threw my (empty) rig in the pocket on the side door.  I only had like 5 seconds to hide shit.  it was pointless there was no getting rid of it and he finds it pretty quick.

he starts going thru my phone and reading my texts. the go thru my car and tow it.

so we both got felony arrested and had to spend the night in the city jail.  the cops told me we would be released the next morning but when they took me back for processing at 6am when they turned those god forsaken lights on (took my DNA and all my finger, thumb, and hand prints) they told me I was under 36 hour investigation for a felony and I wouldn't be getting out for at least that long.

well anyway CO comes by my cell around 1 o'clock and says I'm out of there.

I was released without charges.  but can i still get charged with something later for this?

is my PO gonna find out about it?  the cop told me they wouldn't...

the cop was pretty nice, they even let me listen to the indians game in the squad car lol.

he told me I was ""the smartest heroin addict he ever met."" although it might have been sarcasm haha.

I told him how what he was doing was wrong. and he seemed to admit the drug war was a huge failure.  he implored me to smoke weed instead of shooting up.  I'm just like man i don't like weed anymore I get panic attacks.

I was like man you're throwing me in a cage.  that's horrible to do to someone that's terrible to do to someone, I would never do that to you man. and he's like ""what am I supposed to do?"" and I'm like ""just let me be man, I'd let you be."" and he just said ""I can't do that."" and tried telling me that he truly believed this would help me.

edit: oh ya by the way you know those tins you get at the needle exchange for mixing/cooking dope?  I got my whip out of impound and they just left that shit on the driver seat with a shit ton of residue and the cotton still in it and I got a nice little wash when i got home lol.",1380915791.0

This is going to be long so if you don't feel like being hit with a wall of text just walk away now. And I'm putting this in /r/opiates because the people of this sub are amazing and non-biased and intelligent as fuck and god I really just hate everyone else. Anyway, my insurance company is screwing with my medicine again. I was first prescribed Ambien in Feb of 2011, which was fine until about Feb of 2012 when my insurance company decided I only needed 15 pills a month instead of 30. Just completely randomly, when I went to get it refilled, I was told this. I talked to my doctor and she said the insurance company just didn't have enough information about me, so she sent it to them. Same shit happens the next month, they refuse to pay for any more than 15 (well I could either get 15 10mg pills or 30 5mg pills. Either way, no.) and I have to pay out of pocket. I talk to my doctor and apparently the insurance company lost the info she sent them so she sends it again. Apparently this isn't good enough and they reject my refill request *again*. They then tell me (two weeks later!!) the reason for all of this is because I haven't had a sleep study done in over a year. Of fucking course I haven't had a damn sleep study done, I don't need a sleep study to tell me I can't sleep! I've already had 2 sleep studies done in my life and if you all never have, let me tell you, they fucking suck. 

Okay sorry I'm rambling. Anyway, eventually we work it out that the insurance pays for 1 month, and I alternate paying for the next month. I got sick of fighting them so I had my doc take me off Ambien in May of this year, thinking I'd just try Lunesta. I've been prescribed almost everything except benzos for sleep which is why I was wanting Lunesta. For some reason my doctors look at my failed history with literally every medicine but Ambien and still want to try bullshit medications like Topamax and Remeron. Well, my psychiatrist moved to a different city and I had to get a new one in June and she is nothing like my old one. I told her about my ambien issues and the first thing she says is ""well I don't like ambien and I do not prescribe it to my patients because *I don't like the side effects it has*. What? That isn't fucking up to you but whatever, I stick with her because finding a new psychiatrist is such a hassle. Thankfully in August she did prescribe me Lunesta and my insurance filled the whole 30 pill, 2mg (the highest dosage is 3mg) script, no issues. I call in a refill last night (which is over 2 weeks late by the way because Lunesta is still expensive with insurance), and it goes through fine. I go to pick it up and the pharmacist tells me the insurance won't pay for more than 15 pills. Again. Funny, last month they filled it with no fucking problems. 

I seriously cannot deal with this. Is this legal? The insurance company knows nothing about me. What if I really needed that medication? I mean I do, I barely slept last night but what if it was anti-seizure meds or something? I'm sick of being treated like a god damn criminal. I'm not trying to fill it early or pull a fast one, I'm just trying to get my freaking sleeping pills. Sleeping pills! I'm not stupid, I know about all the fun side effects but for fucks sake I've never had any problems like that or given them any reason to suspect I'm abusing it. 

Whew. Okay. Also, so this is opiate related, me and my boyfriend got screwed again. Was supposed to be getting stuff delivered from a friend but HE got screwed super bad. He's out over $180 and 5+ hours of driving with nothing to show for it and I'm assuming no dope until Friday. Guys, how do you deal with this? We have had nothing but horrible dealers. Our other dealer just dropped us a few days ago because we were tired of his bullshit and called him on it and I am just completely overwhelmed. I got fired and my grandma died last month and now this insurance bullshit and I don't know how much more I can take. Winter is coming so soon and I have SAD on top of normal depression year round and I'm terrified. I swear I barely made it through last winter and it just gets worse every year. October is the month it all starts so I'm just waiting for it to hit. But yeah, we have no connects in this city and I don't have enough gas to make the drive for dope (or the cash really) so we have absolutely nothing until Friday when my pill person comes through with her script. If she decides not to take them all herself.

I'm sorry if this offends anyone, I don't want you all to think I'm using you as my pathetic sounding board or anything, I genuinely don't know what to do about this insurance thing. I tried googling it but all I found were people pissed off about Obamacare. On a COMPLETELY unrelated note, I am so motherfucking ready for Friday because not only is it pill day but Machete Kills comes out and it looks ridiculous and amazing and hilarious and I cannot wait to see it all fucked up and feelin' good. 

TL;DR - Is it legal for your insurance company to yank your prescriptions around without warning? If not what should I do? For that matter if it is legal what should I do? I'm tired of going through the proper, slow channels.",1381066294.0

I've been shooting dope for about a year now and never heard of this little trick. I found it on the internet the other day and have used it multiple times already. 
First when I prep a shot after I sick everything up I'll take my cotton and wipe it around the spoon to get the cotton nice and brown. But I leave it like that cause what's that extra .5 cc going do when I have a couple bags already in the rig. I'll leave the cotton out to dry then, along with about 5 others. I take 2 rigs then and out all the cottons in one. I take out the plunger and push them down to the bottom. Then I'll shot some water down the rig before putting the plunger back in so when I push down i goes through all the cottons. I'll push it down till nothing comes out. And this isn't like water with a tiny of yellow coming out, it's brown just like a regular shot. Take a new cotton and pull it up in your other rig and enjoy!

Classic- Coke and heroin

I fucking lovethis. Somehow the coke makes the dope stronger when it wears off? Doing tar+ecp+coke speedballs in just god damn crazy. Best one I ever did was 1 point of tar, 2 points of ECP, and 3 points of coke. Threw up, coke wore off, and then I was barely awake. Good times

Meth+heroin - This one is fun, but so hard to get right. Plus, once you shoot meth for like 2 days the great rush goes away :/. I only did this with tar+meth or ECP+meth never tar+ecp+meth. Both were good, but its a lot harder to get right. They overpower each other really easy. If you get it right OMG its great. Nodding with meth tingels mmmm.

MDMA+Heroin

 Oh boy. This one is fucking dank as hell. You'll roll harder than ever before. I just shoot dope after the MDMA wears off tho. Pretty nice combo and you only need like half a point of MDMA to roll retarded. You still have the whole overpower issue tho.

Methylone+heroin - This is my 2nd fav speedball. I only did it with tar and found around 250-300mg was perfect for methylone. THe rush last so fucking long wtf? Plus, it goes away pretty gentle and shooting it just last a while longer than shooting coke ontop of drinking. Really great fucking synergy esp cuz of the time frame.

I completely realize that you get a rush that you don't achieve with snorting and also the high is much more intense/better. 
But what I want to know is if it is easier to get off dope if you just are snorting it as opposed to IV'ing?
Is the addiction itself that much worse if you IV it over snorting it?
I snort probably .8 a day and have for quite some time. However I feel that I'm pretty hooked and getting off this shit is gonna be tough.... But if I were IV'ing would it be a lot worse? 
Am I at a point of no return? I just wanted to consult some experts on this subject... I have been using every single day for like 3-4 months without going sick more than twice and never more than 24 hours or really even 12 hours... I'd like to get off but I work 6 days a week and am a high level manager responsible for opening and closing and making sure operations are in tact. So my fear is attempting to get off of it and having to be responsible for making sure my business is open and things are going smooth. Let alone interacting with people and etc.

Additionally, the next morning (still feverish) my morning dose did not make the fever go away (but neither did 800 mg Ibuprofen).

I'd just like to introduce myself, as I've finally made an anonymous account to post with. I've lurked these threads for about a year now and have taken away a lot of wisdom. I've used just about every opiate/opioid under the sun in my 8 years in the game, having had the most fun with ""OG"" OC80's and the morphones.

I don't bang anything, so I tend to favor drugs with high oral/intranasal bioavailability. Methadone is my DOC, I obviously enjoy some other opioids more, but for financial reasons I settled into a 40-100mg a day Methadone habit. This habit is still pretty financially taxing as I pay ~$5 for a 10MG tab. Just a couple weeks ago I finally gave subs a try and I'm upset I hadn't tried them earlier. I've been maintaining with 8mg's a day (buying off the street). paying $8 a strip, this is the cheapest my habit has ever been.

 I now spend about $25 a day on substances. My daily fix is 30MG Adderall+ 4MG Xanax + 8MG Sub (I call it my holy trinity). I'm just rambling now I could go on for hours, but there is a little history of my use and I'm an open minded guy so feel free to message me. oh, and if this post looks like shit I'm sorry I have no idea how to format.

Do they give you 3 days to take it, or do they require you to within 24hrs?

Will they ask before or upon offer of employment?

So I'm talking about the UK mostly, but also elsewhere.

Basically I was just wondering if someone was to go to hospital/ doctors for heroin addiction (and/ or other drugs), and goes on a treatment program and successfully, would this go on a permanent medical record? And if so, would/could this effect possibly future medical procedures? For example, would they be less likely to administer opiate based pain killers? Or would you not be given the option for self administering morphine? Or other such restrictions?

Edit- Great response to this!! It seems like there are some informative answers below too! As an added bonus question though- might having had treatment for addiction in the past effect your employment chances? Or can having addiction history on your medical records limit your field of work (I.e. we've found out below that you would not be employed by the police, and I imagine you could not be in a position where you are responsible for handing out drugs? I don't know, otherwise I wouldn't be asking!).

knowing fentanyl has a higher BA intranasally (I usually swallow oc) I decided to crush and snort a bit of the second one. To my surprise it fucked me up!!! And not for 20min like fentanyl normally does but a good couple hours of pleasure.

I'm in residency at a hospital at the moment and was able to perform a multi panel screen on the pill. It contained not only fentanyl but diamorphine codeine and alprazolam!!

I mean who the fuck takes the time to make a fake, realistic looking oc 80 and then proceeds to actually put multiple drugs in it so it functions similarly!

I told my guy there fakes (concealing the fact there actually pleasurable) and he kindly offered to repay me. Instead I said I knew someone who thought they could sell them and we agreed he could ""repay me"" buy giving me the rest of the fakes.

I've been to a chiropractor several times who has stretched me out and gave adjustments but there is no end in sight because the pain persists. He told me I have sciatica due to a pinched nerve and time will heal it. When that clearly was wrong, I went ahead and scheduled this appointment. Currently the pain is so bad I can't get out of my chair in class without spending 5 minutes trying to boost myself out of the seat with minimal pain, same with getting in/out of my car. I've taken to standing as much as I can because sitting is what really flairs it up, to the point i'm crying out in pain like a weirdo. Even just sitting in a chair and trying to relax is too painful. Now I've talked to many people about this problem and they all say the same thing. ""Just give it time, take ibuprofen, do your stretches, and it will go away in time."" Surely this can't be right since I've put up with it for so long that I'm actually considering withdrawing from my classes because they cause me too much trouble. My question is, for the people who have experienced this type of problem before, what will the doctor do for me today? Will I get any sort of pain relief or hear the same stupid bullshit from the doc? Any tips you can give me also would be of great help. Thanks

**UPDATE:** Not much to tell really. Opiates weren't even brought up as an option. Instead I got a cortisone shot which has improved my pain quite a bit already, and a prescription to Medrol (another steroid) which I'm hoping will heal it over the course of the 7 days I'm supposed to take it. I also had some x-rays taken. The good thing is that even if my back does get better, the doc said we will follow up in about a week to review my x-rays and see how the steroids are doing, and I can always lie and say it's not working to try and get a script. The problem with that is if I do go that route I'll probably get sent to some bullshit PT that I don't want to do.

1o4slc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1o4slc/shooting_through_suboxone/,6,https://redd.it/1o4slc,eXiled,Shooting through suboxone?,"Read thread in full if you want more information to answer accurately. 

**TLDR:** Will IV 200mg of morphine (+4mg of xanax but not same receptors), which is the highest dose I shoot at once at the moment, be able to punch through 2mg of suboxone (would take 4mg to make me feel normal and 8mg to feel normal and stop cravings etc). Also I haven't had subs in week but shot 200mg of morphine about 16 and 24 hours ago.

ALSO: bupe BA sublingual is 55% so technically I only have 1mg affecting my brain.

So I'd only really like to hear answers from people with personal experiences and no exagerrating, i'd rather wait then completely waste.

So heres the deal around 3 hours ago I took 2mg of suboxone, now atm 2mg is not even enough to really stop all the sickness, it does stop a lot of it though but im not physically comfortable, 4mg will make me physically comfortable and 8mg I presume would actually help with cravings and stuff.

Now I shoot 200mg of morphine (pharm grade) or 200mg of Heroin, I doubled my dose after the last 1-2 months from 100mg to 200mg, and atm 200mg is a dose that not only gets me buzzed, but nodding etc, It's still a high dose, but I could still add an extra 100mg of each, but I would be having a very heavy nod, I also have all the xanax I need and I will probs take 4mg cuz of the sub.

I have shot almost 12 hours after 4mg of sub with heroin and it seemed to be around 60-70%, but this is half the amount of sub, and double the dose of opiates plus 4mg of xanax (normal xanax dose is 2mg with 1-2mg added later).

I also IV'd narcan today while sober, read it lasts about 15 minutes so was perfect to really prove I was sick to the doctor (had a problem with that for uni forms last time), had to refuse the blood test though cuz of my arms. I was supposed to have a shot of opiates ready for right after I got out but didn't cuz I slept through my alarm and only had meth, the meth I don't even know if I felt probs cuz I been using it past 3 days. my last opiate dose was 16 hours prior and I use everyday, do not try this, it makes you feel terrible, different then opiate sickness as well, and a really disgusting taste in your mouth. And that was only 400ug, some ambos use 800-2000ug.

EDIT: I ended up shooting it 7.5 hours later, I still got a great rush (shot all 200mg at once which normally because of the histamine reaction would be overpowering and unbearable) ate 4.5mg worth of xanax (I usually have 2mg and only past 2-3 days have I been having more). But the high is not as good as it should be (feels more like 100mg atm) but to truely gauge I have to wait a while cuz I find morphine mellows out after the first 15-20 mins plus im waiting for xan to kick in and this is usually when I will nod or know if I'm going to nod so I'll update then, I wish I could have just slept and waited 24 hours but I can never sleep when I know opiates are sitting there and I can use them easily, unless I'm already really high. 

I'm just glad I only took 2mg through a ROA that has only 55% BA, don't know what I'd do if I IV'd 8mg or something.

EDIT 2: Ended up having a good nod but a bit too much xanax was out for a lot of my high, felt like I lost about 30% of my morphine maybe less, maybe more, was a bit hard to tell because I was still pretty noddy and sedated from the xanax.",1381396633.0

1o4goa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1o4goa/my_detox_experience/,38,https://redd.it/1o4goa,JuicyJay,My detox experience,"I would just like to start by saying I am writing this purely to share my experience and insight on detox.  I currently do still use heroin regularly, but I recently had to go through an in home detox, somewhat forced on my through my parents (which is why I even did it in the first place, and probably why I am right back where I started).

The story starts about 3 weeks ago.  I had a full blown habit and dependency that began about 7 months ago.  I live in Baltimore county, a little east of Towson if you are familiar with the area, so I have easy access to amazing powder any time that I want it.  At this point, I was snorting about .5g a day, which is not an insane amount in my opinion, but it is definitely a solid habit.  I have never nor do I ever plan on IVing it as I am terrified of needles, but this is still a significant enough amount that if I do not have it, I get pretty serious withdraw symptoms. 

I am a 21 year old guy who has been attending University of Maryland for computer science.  Although I haven't decided to drop out yet, I did take this current semester off in order to try to save money so that I don't have to work next semester (which so far, I have completely failed in doing).  

Anyway, it all started about 3 weeks ago, right after I had gone to work to pick up my paycheck, which I immediately deposited and took out $60 to go buy .5g of raw to split with my sister.  We had been in this together for the entire time I was dependent on it, which really helped because if I was broke she would usually have money and vise versa.  It really helped me avoid being sick pretty much all the time.  We were partners in crime, helping each other whenever it was needed.  This specific day, we were splitting a half gram of some of the best powder I have had for a few months.  Once I got home with it, I immediately ran into my room to crush it up (it was quite rocky in a good way).  As I'm sitting there with a dollar and a card crushing up this powder, I pick up the dollar to scrape off the powder that had stuck to it.  I look behind me and to my surprise find my dad standing right there.  I immediately knew I was caught.  There was no hiding it at this point as there was a cd case with a ton of powder on it and a corner of a plastic bag sitting right next to it.  

My parents had suspected something was up considering I never had any money in the bank and I was always going on sketchy car rides that took longer than they should have.  But now they knew for sure.  My dad knew it was heroin, and shortly after took it to my mom and told her as well.  She took the case and flushed the whole .5g down the toilet.  I had to sit there in my parents room and explain to them what was going on.  They were so hurt, I could see it in their eyes.  They believed this was the reason I had been doing so poorly in school and really wanted to send me to rehab.  Somehow I convinced them that I could do it on my own and that rehab wouldn't work for me (which I still believe to be true, you can't have someone force you to get better you have to want to do it on your own).  And thus began my week of withdraw hell.  

I really don't think I could go through withdraw without my parents realizing what was happening.  The fact that they knew what I was going through helped me tremendously.  If you are really serious about doing it and you live with people who care about you, I really recommend letting them know what you are going to be going through.  If they truly care about you, they will not sit there and judge you and will be willing to help you through the whole detox experience.  On to the next part of my story.

I did not completely cold turkey detox off dope.  Although I stayed off of actual heroin for a whole week, I had 1 8mg suboxone strip to help me through the process.  This is the part of the story I most wanted to share with you all.  The way I used this suboxone to detox helped me get through the worst part of the withdraw.  I know that a lot of places will recommend a taper for suboxone in order to get you clean, but I also know that many places will prescribe them to people for months and months until they are just as hooked on subs as they were on dope.  Tapering is key to actually get off of it with the least amount of withdraw possible. 

The first night without it, I dealt with wd symptoms without anything, and it was the worst, most uncomfortable night of my life.  The next day I was texting everyone I knew trying to find suboxones, and luckily found someone who was willing to sell me only 1 8mg strip.  I took this strip and ripped it in half, eating 4mg the second day clean. Then I took 2mg the following day and 2mg the day after that.  It did not eliminate all of my withdraw symptoms, but it did help ease the symptoms tremendously.  The day after I took the last 2mg, I felt a lot more normal, and most of the sickness had subsided.  It took about 2 or 3 more days until I could really sleep comfortably, but it was much easier than going completely cold turkey.  I highly recommend a 3 day taper with suboxone if you need to get clean.  It greatly improves your condition and will help you stay off of opiates since you can't actually take them on suboxones anyway. It also prevents you from just substituting dope for suboxones and delaying the withdraw process, since suboxone will cause you just as bad symptoms as heroin or opiates.

Sorry for the long wall of text, thanks for reading my story.

TLDR: to get clean, taper with suboxones over 3-4 days and it will be worlds easier than going cold turkey.

I am a 26 year old college graduate out of UW Madison with a bachelors in Journalism. I have three small wonderful children all under the age of three. 2yr old boy, 1yr old daughter and 3 month old son. I am married and unemployed. About year and half ago my story begins like many others Ive read on this sub with an accident and a handful of pills from an over zealous doctor.

I fell out one morning from a seizure, the fall resulted me in receiving six compression fractures in my spine and a crushed left rotator cuff in my shoulder. After six months I had burned every single bridge with every hospital and doctor between here and the mississippi river. It was only a few weeks after being really sick we got a knock on the door from the department of human services and child protective services. To this day have no idea how they came to be in our lives but if anyone has ever dealt with these people you understand how they are still in our lives a year later.

Of course I was given the whole speel about how shitty of a person and parent I am by putting my family through this and the only salvation for me was to do what they wanted and exactly how they wanted it or id loose my kids for good. They quickly told me to volunteer to goto a 21 day treatment program and from there to a drug court program. Which I did fucking hated them all the way through it but managed to get 6 months clean until we had our most recent child. They swore up and down that they wouldnt be taking our youngest out of the home like they did the other two. Then one day we left our youngest at grandmas for a few hours while we attended court. Everything went great at court except I got chastized for missing a ua but no biggie my first one and i tested the next day to prove i was clean. Well then we walked out of court and into the hands of dhs which were carrying papers to adjudacate our son. We were told we werent allowed to go pick him back up. My wife was crying I held it all in because I knew what was to come that night.

With never trying heroin I knew where to buy it. I left the court that day and bought a half gram with a bunch of xanax. The next week was a blur I was self sabatoging pretty gruesome like. Putting enough drugs up my nose to kill a normal person. This continued about a week longer until my mom called me and said she was on her way to come be with me and my wife and help us get back on track. She flew from Atlanta later that day and I quickly began to tell her in the part of the story I wanted her to hear. That I had relapsed but not telling her on what and she as naive to the drugs she is believed it to be just doctor prescribed harmless ol painkillers. This continued for a week until she left for back home. Then today.

My brother kyle is a little estranged from the rest of the family for personal choices. He calls me for the first time in over a year to talk to me about whats going on and I lay it all on him and tell him im thinking about methadone he suggests buying me a 30 day supply of suboxone off the street for 300 bucks. I tell him to hold off Im getting screened for methadone on friday anyway. It wasnt even ten minutes after hanging up with him he had called my mom and told her everything about everything.

Well, I found out first hand how it works. Your mileage may vary depending on the hospital and their knowledge.  

I wrecked out on my motorcycle and broke my tibia in several places including the top (plateau) where it articulates with the knee. In addition, I tore my meniscus. I ended up calling an ambulance myself because I knew something bad had happened to the leg. I told the paramedics of my medication and they had me hold out from receiving anything (which is always their preference if they can). I was wheeled into the ER and told the Doctor that I was taking suboxone. All of the staff had extremely limited knowledge about it and how it works. I tend to study medicine for fun so I was able to explain how it functioned and what I believed were the two options.  1. We increase the suboxone dosage and hope that it provides enough pain relief.  2. We have to break through it which would take large amounts of pain medication because of its blocking effects and previous tolerance. 

The Dr. said, I can take care of your pain, and immediately I felt assured that he had some special trick.  I said OK and he came back with 1mg of IV dilaudid. I gasped as I said that isn't going to do anything. I mean...not a thing.  There is no way. The Doctor assured me that he would give me more, but he didn't want to give me a bunch at a time and risk something happening.  I thought, OK, maybe with enough, this will work.  Over the course of multiple hours, I received only 4mg..not enough to do anything.  By this point, they were asking if I wanted to be admitted for pain control and I didn't know what to do.  I eventually realized that suboxone wasn't going to control this, but that I also was going to have to ride out its long half life until I started to get some relief because the hospital isn't in the business of giving super high dosages to people. I got admitted where the attending Doctor had to be filled in on my situation as did the nurses.  I explained the problem and hoped that they would come back with some large dosages.  They decided to do 4mg of Morphine every 4 hours. The pain was pretty substantial. It was a weird feeling.  In the ER, I could feel the 4mg in dilaudid in my system, but not it really working, just a heaviness in my eyelids.  For the first 24 hours, I really didn't feel any of the morphine either. After that though, when they would IV it, I would get a rush that would swoop through my body and then be gone as quickly as it came.  With each 4 hours that went by, the morphine took a little more as it built up and the suboxone continued to eliminate. After a couple days, the pain was mostly under control. By the 3rd day, I think the suboxone was pretty much gone.  Note, my normal dosage of sub is 8-12mg per day (a fairly hefty amount).  

Overall, the staff was pretty clueless about the medication and how to handle it.  They weren't prepared to counter it with larger dosages of meds and I just had to kind of work through it.  It sucks that there aren't any better options.  Suboxone can be a useful tool, but you have to advocate for yourself if you are on it since not many people are familiar with how it functions.  It almost makes me think that users should wear a bracelet in case you were unconscious and they were considering surgery.   As it happened, my leg did require surgery and they made me wait several days until the suboxone was completely out of the system.  I ended up leaving the hospital for a few days while I waited for the surgery. One of the pain docs saw me and gave me 30mg oxy IR to handle the pain until the surgery.  

On the day of the surgery, I took my oxy in the morning.  They gave me Versed prior to knocking me out, which did nothing.  The anesthesia burnt like fire as it coursed through my arm, fortunately knocking me out shortly after administering.  I woke up and the next several hours were hazy as they pushed a large amount of dilaudid to manage the pain.  Eventually I was brought up to a room with a dilaudid pump (0.6mg every 8-10 minutes or so), which they switched here and there...at one point it was up to 0.8mg every 8.  I blasted through tubes of hydromorphone, needing them switched nearly every hour which even to me seemed extreme. I remember having a gall bladder surgery years back where I received 0.2mg every 10 minutes and didn't ever need a refill on the meds.  I stayed on the pump for a couple days until finally they switched me to oxy 30mg IR orally every 3 hours with 2mg of dilaudid IV every 2 hours for breakthrough pain.  When I left, the doctor gave me 1 week of oxy 30mg IR.  I am now a week out of surgery and have used the oxycodone to completion.  In Illinois, they cannot call in refills of oxy, so I've been put on norco (hydrocodone 10mg/325mg) which isn't doing a very good job of controlling the pain.  I wish the doctor at the hospital would have given me a larger script, but he said it was an acute problem that should be healing (and he is right to an extent), but I have a foot long incision down my leg with about 30 stitches, multiple screws, and newly connected ligaments.  A week of pain relief doesn't really cut it.  I'm not allowed to put weight on the leg until about Christmas time and then will have to learn how to walk on it again.  I'm in a tough spot when it comes to the pain meds and suboxone.  If I run out of pain meds, I'll hit withdrawal and that will be too much to deal with the leg already hurting.  If I switch back to subs, I'll have to wait 24 hours or so to avoid precipitated withdrawals which will be a bit tough.  I also don't know how well suboxone will work for the leg pain.  All in all, it's a tricky situation to deal with.  I'm considering contacting a physical therapy & pain management practice to help until the leg is really under control. 

If anyone has any questions, feel free.   

UPDATE: I knew that going doc to doc trying to get pain meds stronger than norco was going to be a tough challenge, especially with my limited amount of pills and getting an appointment.  I could have possibly tried to ween off the norco and be opi free, but I didn't think I had enough of them, nor would it be ideal with post-op leg pain still persisting.  In addition, my sub doctor had been questioning what the plan was, when I could get back in.  He wishes that I had just used higher dosages of sub, but unfortunately, the surgeons wouldn't allow that.  So with time running out on my hydrocodone pills, I set out a list of my arsenal...clonazepam, alprazelam, ace bandages, loperamid, heating pads, hot baths, etc. and took my last dosage of norco around 830pm last night.  I slept as long as I could waking up at midnight, 6am, and then noon.  Because of a leg that isn't very mobile, I knew the RLS would drive me up the wall, so I used benzos in my favor to call everything down.  I spaced out hot baths and heating pads and wraps in between.  Around 3, it really started to get to me.  I went as long as I could until about 7:30 and then started dosing 2mg of sub at a time.  By 4mg I actually fell asleep for an hour because of the lingering clonazepam.  I woke up with some more pain and brought my dosage up to 8mg where I feel pretty good.  I am thanking every deity I can think of that I didn't get any precipitated withdrawl.  Now I can continue on the subs and taper down off that as my leg heals. I can also consult the doctors for non-narcotic based pain meds/injections for the leg for the next several weeks.   I made the right call.  I couldn't go without anything...the withdrawal would have been too severe to handle with my injury and quite frankly, I think I'd be too tempted to grab other goodies.  I'm hoping my Doc isn't upset I re-induced subs without his supervision but I didn't have much of a choice and I followed the exact protocol he did. It was a shitty 24 hours, but I made it, and I'm glad I went his way because at one point, I was ready to call a dealer. ",1381344387.0

Yesterday I got suboxone prescribed by a Doctor and at 2 P.M. yesterday I took my first 4 mg dose and by 2:15 I was in the worst withdrawals by far I have ever experienced.  

In total yesterday I took 16mg of suboxone and today so far I have taken 16 mgs. 

The doctor didn't warn me about the precipitated withdrawals and he told me it only happens to 1/200 people and he hasn't been helping me or giving me advice at all.

If yesterday my pain was a 10/10 today I would say I am a 8/10.  I am able to eat a little and talk but the restlessness, sweats and everything else is driving me insane.  

I am allowed to take up to 32 mgs per day, but I don't know if taking more will hurt me more or help at this point.  Should I take 16mgs over the course of the day or should I wait till tomorrow to take more? 

Anyone that has been in PW knows how much it sucks.  I really would appreciate any advice or helpful information.

Treatment has included pain meds (Oxy 5's, nothing crazy, but does the trick). The doc wanted me to start pain mgmt, using the clinic that is part of the same med group my spine doc is associated with -- same office and everything. 

So I made an appt with PM clinic. The way this particular PM clinic works is that I have to see an in-house psychologist first, and then they make a decision and I move on to seeing the actual PM doc. They sent me a bunch of paperwork to fill out prior to my initial visit, which I did, and then I had the meeting with the psychologist. 

This meeting was one of the most uncomfortable doctor experiences of my life, and possibly a huge waste of time. He barely looked me in the eye, then proceeded to ask me a series of questions that were *all* on the questionnaire I had previously filled out, yet he hammered on the ""do you use recreational drugs,"" ""do you drink,"" etc. 

Here's my worry: I was anticipating a drug test, so I was honest about my occasional use of marijuana, and admitting to getting buzzed if I go out for drinks with my buddies ""maybe once a week."" Now, that doesn't seem as bad, but then he asked me if I ever took more pain meds than prescribed, and whether I use alternate methods of ingestion. Again, I answered truthfully. I told him I sometimes have to take two pills at a time to get decent relief, but explained that I had mentioned this to my doctor a number of times and she was okay with it. He then turned on the prick-o-meter to max and asked me what I do when I run out of pills before my refill is ready: I picked up on this being an accusatory and ""gotcha"" question, so I told him I never run out, but that I cut it close every time I come back for a new script. 

After that, the meeting was basically over. Told me that he will meet with the pain mgmt team to decide ""if"" they can help me, and that I will hear back in a few days. 

Meeting over. Basically, I took time off from my schedule to go to this meeting where the doc asked me a series of questions already answered on the papers I gave him at the end of the meeting, and to be treated like a drug addict right off the bat. Did I fuck up somewhere? The weed use? The admitting to occasionally have some drinks? Smoking cigarettes? 

Sorry this is so long, but it's really bugging me out. Kind of my last resort for pain relief and those sweet, sweet meds.

I have a pretty average/average-low tolerance to opiates, but I was just prescribed from oxycontin 20's for a work injury. I regularly eat grapefruits. Like, 2-3 fruits a day. In the past I struggled with anxiety and was prescribed Xanax (Have a few still around just in case, but no longer taking regularly), so I know to check to see if certain meds are impacted by grapefruits/grapefruit juice. (Note: I never mixed Grapefruits with Xanax. I stopped eating them while I was regularly taking the Xanax)

A quick google search scared the everliving fuck out of me. The first thing that comes up is web articles talking about how grapefruits and oxy have killed people/caused breathing problems/etc.

Will the large amount of grapefruits I've consumed be dangerous if I take the oxy, considering I don't have much opiate tolerance? I'm in a pretty decent amount of pain, so I'd like to take this oxy, but it's definitely not worth ending up in the ER.

Thanks in advance for any help guys/gals!",1381481767.0

So that he would understand when I say ""I'm really fucking sick, can you do this in 30 minutes before I have to go to work?"", he could answer honestly.  
Starts off he makes me wait 35 mins, rings 5 minutes before arriving saying he's only got 1, but if I come back later he'll sort me out.this means trekking through the cold, shitty streets at 9:00, and him 'hooking me up' is me paying normal price.  
Fuck it, at least I won't be sick for work.  
Finally arrives, gives me the 1 and I walk to the nearest bathroom.  
As soon as I see it I know somethings up, I open it and the dick has given me rock by mistake (they're packaged identically).  
I phone him up, meet him 10 mins later and go to my backup guy, who sorts me out in 5 minutes.

She did nothing (no job searching, no cleaning, not much at all) for maybe 6-8 months, complaining to me about how unresponsive I was the whole time. It eventually lead to her cutting the shit out of herself and exposing her arms and thighs to me.

It was at that point I realised that I didn't know her. Everytime I removed her clothes, I was reminded of how much I was a failure of a partner, every scar told the story of a tear.

Ok so I got my birthday dope today. Some good Philly stuff. It's my first time shooting it (I have Narcan handy as well). I did every in a clean responsible manner. 
I had issues though, as a noob would. I first tried in the typical spot, the crook of my elbow. That was a clusterfuck. Never registering properly. Then I moved down towards the side of my arm/inside wrist area. I was finally able to register (that blood really did shoot up in the needle fast) on an area in the area on the inside area of my arm on the side about an inch or two up from my wrist. 
I slowly pushed down the plunger but here's where I think I messed up--I forgot to check to make sure I was still in the vein by re-registering. 
My shot was super small to begin with (safety first) and I'm pretty sure I missed most of it.
No rush of course but the area around the injection site puffed up a little and itched.
I felt nice though--warm and fuzzy. I cleaned up and have a warm compress on it now.

I'm asking for you guys to critique what I did as best you can. I know this is difficult. 
*Also do you guys have any tips to make this easier and how I can calm down and not panic.

Sorry if I ramble on and this doesn't make sense but I'm gonna put all out there as it comes, so try and bear with me give me some advice on what to do and what to expect. It all started about 2 years ago when my friends mom was prescribed OP 40's like 160 a month.. She was terminally ill but didn't really take them and she have them to him pretty much whenever he wanted and however many he wanted. We went in together and at first we could take a 1/4 and be set all day or not even ask for any or want any and that was ok. We didn't need them it was just for fun. We might take 1/4 one day or two days in a row then go a week without any. Then about 3 months into that he began getting 1 pill everyday and would bring it to school (we had a computer class together) and he would split it with me so it was about 20mg a day but every single day. Then it started to get to where we would each get a pill and take half in that class then half towards the end of the day. Every single day. About 3 months at that habit I had to get my appendix removed and was prescribed 30 5/500 hydrocodone's with two refills. My tolerance was up and I blew threw those in no time. At this point I would say I was somewhat ""addicted"" or I really wanted something every single day I could no longer take a break anymore. Then about 1 month after that my mom had a foot surgery and was prescribed 60 10/325 hydrocodone's, she took one and told me she didn't like the way they made her feel and just opted to take Tylenol and put them in the cabinet with the usual Benadryl, Tylenol, etc. so as you can imagine I blew through those in no time as well. One morning before school she woke me up and asked where all her pills had gone and I told her I had taken a few because of some back pain I was having and sold the rest. (She would have rather heard that than that I was taking that many) she was pissed but as far as she knew I didn't have an addiction I just wanted some money. I told her they went for $6 a pill and she sort of understood where I was coming from but this is the point where I began feeling guilty for lying to her and to myself. But I couldn't stop I was addicted 100% by this point. Don't forget all the OP's I was still taking on top of this. Eventually the friend who had the OP's mom died of cancer and those were cut out and he chose to go live with a family friend who ""would put him on the right track"" his family was a piece of shit. He hated his dad, his sister was synonymous with Scumbag Stacy, etc and he eventually straightened out and quit for good, got a job, and really started doing well for himself and that was then end of the promised every day oxy for me. I started buying at this point and as you can imagine I had quite a tolerance and was now on my on. I had no opiate buddy to enjoy it with. It was just me and my addiction. I would buy them every single day and when I couldn't find any I was sick. I couldn't function. I went on to experiment with damn near every opiate out there.. Hydro, oxy, diladid (sp?), morphine, promethazine and codeine syrup, even some fentanyl patches, everything. Then I found a pretty constant connect on suboxone and figured this might be a good time to quit. I was taking about 1/4 a patch of suboxone every morning (2mg) and weened down until I was clean. My life didn't have that ""opiate fullness"" anymore but hey, my wallet was full now so that was pretty ok. This lasted about 4 months. Then I got my job which is training at an automotive service shop where I had to have focus and I messed around with adderall and vyvanse a little bit but I didn't like not being able to eat, feeling zombified, and the crash. Back to opiates. My tolerance was pretty low now but even after all that time it never went back to my ""opiate naive"" tolerance and it took about 10mg to get me in the zone. I was back to everyday all day and worked my way up to about 70mg a day for awhile until I realized I was spending a good portion of my paycheck just to be able to ""do work"" I was addicted again but I couldn't just quit now. I had a job and priorities. I couldn't afford to be sick and miss days. I was stuck. This continued for about a year. Then the time came recently where I had to have carpal tunnel surgery and was going to be out of work for about 6 weeks and my prescription was written pre surgery and I was only prescribed 30/500 codeine pills. These were weak to me but I figured while I was out I could afford to be dope sick and just use those to eventually bring myself back to normal. It was an opportunity. I had two refills and for the first one I stuck to it. I was sick but not too bad, the codeine kept the major W/D's at bay. Second refill was a different story. I figured they were weak so it wouldn't be like hydro or oxy. I could splurge a little and have that ""good feeling"" for a few more times. I started taking about 4 pills at a time and didn't stop until I was out. No more refills. 2 weeks before I went back to work I started fucking with hydro and oxy again. Fuck. I did okay and now were pretty much in the present, I just went back to work about 2 weeks ago and I'm currently only using 30-40mg of hydro a day but when I stop now the withdrawals are worse than ever for some reason. I'm at that point where I've quit before and I know how it is but I still don't know how to fully ""quit"", just take breaks. Right now I'm sitting on 1 10mg hydro and 1 10mg oxy and am planning on taking the hydro in a few min and the oxy in the morning then going cold turkey. Using loperamide to deal with the minor stuff but fuck. I need to be done. I can't just be sick, I can't stay out of work, and I can't go to work sick because my coworkers which have also become really close friends of mine don't even know I'm addicted. They just think that how I am. I don't wasn't them to know because they really like me and this might make them consider me an addict or something and I just don't want them being disappointed or anything. Also I went to court this morning due to a minor possession of marijuana charge and opted for PTI so I wouldn't lose my job and now I'm expecting a drug test in about 2 weeks. Not only do I need to quit because I want to be myself again but now so I won't go to jail if I fail a drug test. What do I do. I know this is long but I'm at a low point in my life and it just feels good to vent. Anyone with similar circumstances? How did you deal? How long does it take for that urge to use to go away? How do you ""play off"" W/D's in front of people you care about? What helps you? Please help point me in the right direction, it would really mean a lot. If this actually gets some answers this will make me feel good. Not alone. If you read to this point I truly thank you, I know that was crazy long but like I said. Venting feels good sometimes. :/ ",1381536730.0

I got out of rehab august 24th of this year(was in there for three months) and have been sober since then ( ok I lie , I still smoke weed). So today I was smoking a cigarette in front of my house and an old friend randomly drives by.  As we chill and catch up he mentions he has cheap white and a lot of kpins....and I failed:/.
   I'm aware I relapsed or lapsed, depending on if you go with the 12 step definition or the one from SMART, and also understand the science , or what passes for science in American psychiatry and neuroscience( yes I know, young scientific field blah blah blah, and yea, it's a really cool  field, and they are amazing at making real cool ,irrelevant discoveries that are easy to market as understanding, which honestly doesn't exist within these fields at this time. Sorry for the rant, but yea so pretty much I'm trying to figure out how I feel about my relapse. 

 During my stay in rehab, I was never sure about how I felt about what I was learning. According to rebt and cbt, black and white thinking is one of the ways we disturb our thinking. From my understanding sobriety is a black and white concept, so the only way for sobriety to not disturb our thoughts,  sobriety needs a new understanding or definition, Sorry  for rambling, I'm a nerd, have a degree in Phil, rel studies, history(that was an accident) and minors in mandarin and physics. I'm still confused on when being smart become cool.

  While studying religion i fell in love with buddhism, probably because it's not really a religion.  A fundamental doctrine of these teaching is the concept of the middle way( Ill explain more about that in a comment) which more or less says that peace can only be found between the extremes.  I'm  very aware I'm  misusing extremely sacred teachings completely ,in the classical, religious sense.  My opinion though is that  Buddhism was developed by the best philosopher/ psychologist that ever lived who developed teachings and doctrines that reveal an inclusive,universal,dynamic understanding of the human condition set up in way that makes historical and cultural context irrelevant.

 I still am not sure what I think yet but was hoping you guys might have advice.

I get the generic n-200 morphs and at first thought they were good only for swallowing since they gel up like an asshole when you try to prep for IV. I asked my dealer how to prepare these and he sowed me and it's perfect. No gelling. You can save the solution for later use too. All you need is a syringe with a 3cc capacity and a cig filter. *note the best heater you can use is an electric stove*
*this all needs to be done very fast so I'd recommend having multiple syringes hanging around*
Step 1: pick your dose. I'd use half of a red rocket which is 100mg. Do not crush the dose. 
Step 2: prepare a 3cc syringe with a needle point already covered with a filter. I use cig filters for this particular method since it covers the whole pin.
Step 3: with an extra syringe, put 3cc of water into the spoon. Place whole chunk of pill in spoon.
Step 4: place spoon on heat. An electric stove is best but a candle with a large flame will suffice. 
Step 5: bring to a boil. Let solution boil for 10 seconds.
Step 6: quickly remove spoon from heat. 
Step 7: mash up the pill and mix it around with the back end of a plunger. 

At this point you can return the mixture to heat for 5 more seconds but you don't really need to. 

Step 8: take syringe with cotton on it and draw. I used a 25g point to draw so that it's quicker. 
Step 9: run the syringe under cold water to cool solution. It is now ready to IV! 

I usually split the shots into two even doses of 50mg. There is another method on the internet using toluene and alcohol to extract the pure morphine but this is infinitely faster. There is a lot of room for error though so be mindful of what you're doing.

I know a lot of you don't know me, or all of you don't know me. I comment from time to time but generally, am unknown in the way it seems like you all are like friends or something. But anyway, tomorrow, I am going to start on my road to sobriety. I have an appointment with a suboxone doctor and I'm a little nervous about it.

I've been an addict for 6 years, since I was 18. I started doing opiates because I had just lost my sister and needed to forget my pain but was getting in too much trouble drinking. I tried an oxy 40, and when I realized I could play it off, and it was the most amazing feeling ever, an addiction was born. I've tried lots and lots of drugs but opiates are the only ones I ever wanted to be on 24/7.

I've ruined my life with this addiction and I'm tired of the withdrawal waking me up every morning. I'm tired of stealing from people or asking everyone I know for money. I'm tired of my family looking at me with pity and disgust. I love everyone and I feel like everyone is exhausted from loving me, cuz it comes with such a big cost. 

I realized I had to make a change when I stopped looking forward to waking up in the morning and when I felt like I needed the opiates to even function, emotionally, because I'm always so depressed and anxious and feel overwhelming guilt from all the things I've done. I used to look to opiates to enhance my life- now they're the only way I feel okay enough to deal with my life. I got over the grief from my sister's passing gradually, but the addiction stayed and now it's draining the life from me, and I want to feel like myself again.

Sorry if this is all over the place, but I'm such a wreck, emotionally, I feel like I can't even stay on point anymore. Thanks for reading, if you did, I just needed to get this off my chest

About 6 hours later, I insufflate another .5 mg, and briefly, but very briefly, my anxiety is relieved.

I also took around 1 mg etizolam today at around 4 hours after first suboxone dose. It helped dull the anxiety, but not remove it. Because of the nature of my work, I cannot take any higher a dose of benzo. This is just annoying because I am out of opiates except suboxone, and it won't even have the effect I started using for.

Lost and found.,"Someone in my family gets Opana 30s for back pain. They have to hide it from me because I'm a drug addict who can't stop stealing them. Well I stopped stealing them years ago. Well to get high, I've been buying poppy seeds. It works great. I really enjoy the opium high. Anyway, I walk into person's room, and I find an Opana 30 just laying on the ground. They receive 60 per month. It's not like they are going to miss just this one. I have been on the PST (poppy seed tea), but this will be an awesome break from that to get even higher :)

Anyone have any stories of good luck finding opiates that you misplaced or randomly found? I'm going to post some pics of my new batch of seeds coming in along with the tea I make from it. Hope you guys enjoy it. I will post in probably 3 days. 

Btw, I think this is an important issue: If you are going to go into withdrawal, take loperamide please. I think this is extremely important to let any opiate addict know loperamide can cure your withdrawals because it's an opiate also. (Opioid I guess.) I don't want anyone in the ""community"" to have unnecessary suffering. It will prevent withdrawal, and it has a decent blocking effect. If you are broke, use it as a cheap temporary replacement for Buprenorphine. ",1381780971.0

I just wanted to stop in and introduce myself to the community. My name is DieselKing and much apologies to HeroinKing for the resembelance I didn't notice until after I registered. Ive been using opiates now for the past ten years and only the past month Heroin. Never shot it yet but I definitely knew it was coming sooner then later. Ive been sitting in detox actually I'm in here as I write this since last Thursday. Thank God I was able to sneak my phone in here (strictly forbidden) otherwise I don't think I could've done this. Reading everything I have for the past few days on this sub has really really given me hope and a sense of community and support. 

Anyway I came into detox because of DHS involvement with my kids. Its a long ducking story but the jist of it was because I used drugs although in private they felt the need to intervene and remove my kids away from me and my wife. I volunteerd to leave the home so my wife so she wouldn't loose the kids for doing nothing wrong. Shes never used any substance besides alcohol a handful of times in her life. So I came out to detox and its pretty here they kept me on clonidene for w/s and trazadone for sleep which helped out a lot before I was offered to go onto the methadone program. I did my research and felt like this was a good idea. To be honest mostly because I read that it does give you a buzz in the beginning and I wasn't wanting to give that feeling up quite yet compared to suboxone.

After doing all the paperwork this weekend and getting my bloodwork done I was told I wouldn't be able to start dosing until Tuesday because of the holiday today. Who the fuck celebrates Columbus Day!? Anyway I was woken up at 6:30 this morning told me they did end up getting me registered and I would be dosing today! Thank God because I feel 20x better now! I think they only start you off on 30mg and I didn't think that would do shit but I feel pretty good. So I decided today that ill ne staying for the 21 day program here. I am serious about changing my life but still I'm finding it hard to think that I'm going to go home and flush the 1/4 gram, the two Roxy 30mg, and the somas I have. Maybe ill feel different after a while. Well thanks for letting me ramble guys and forever grateful to be a part of the community here",1381774468.0

Anywho, said girl became my enabler for about a good year, after spending 25k in 6 months and becoming bankrupt we broke up last year in November, last time we had sex was in September of last year... so its been over a year for me now

I'd say im a pretty decent looking guy too, I've actually asked a couple of girls if they thought they would feel special if I told the next girl I dated that I hadnt had sex in over a year or if they would think it was weird..... lol

What happened to me,"Ok first time posting but I have been lurking here for a while.. I don't know if I'm allowed to ask what happened to me but I will anyways.. I don't go to any doctor or hospital, as I don't need it on my record I'm an addicted.. I have kept this shit secret from everyone I knew before I started drugs.. Only my man knows and the people I met once I was a  addicted, so can't just go to hospital but something isn't right and after 3years of using, my man 10yrs we have never seen it before...

First I live in Ireland, I think most of you are American and H is different over there as I have heard.. We use critic to cook it up, don't know if others have to, but it can burn sometimes, sting really bad, ESP if you use to much.. 
So I am about to inject, Inject in same place I have been getting about a week now, Easy enough to get blood comes in, I am happy I go to push and oh my god the pain from just pushing a tiny bit in.. I pull back blood still flows in so I must be in right ,maybe I used to much critic and it is just burning. I ignore this awful pain, pain I never had before, it is burning and I feel like crying but I keep going.. So I enjoy my high,  An hour later I see I have a critic burn, had them before they are like white lumps and can feel very hot. My man goes in his groin he doesn't get them but I do a lot, I am thinking just like always it will go but instead of been a white lump it is like someone drew a map on me, it was like the critic flowed through the veins and made a weird shape ( a bit round) on my arm, But then it starts going a brown colour in the shape, I still don't panic, but know I must of did something wrong. 

So time for my next turn on I cant get anywhere else so been the addict I am I decide oh I'll go back there, Only when I stick the needle in I feel nothing... inside this mad shape is totally numb.. I start to stab the needle in a few spots to see is it all numb it is.. Next day I want to show my man it is still numb, I have long nails so start digging them in to show look I can bleed but feel nothing.. So here I am now big lump on my arm that is totally numb. It was brown now going red and has dirty looking black scabs on it from when I was picking to see how numb it is and were I hit with the spike.. 
When I rub my hand over it I get a pins and needles feeling in a different part of my arm... I am so scared I will lose my arm. Has this ever happened to anyone going numb and staying numb 4days now. It really doesn't look healthy and I am sick when I look at it that I done this to my body.. I am a goodlooking Junkie, Who doesn't look like one and I want/need to keep it that way..

After two very long weeks of no H I finally managed to score 3 bags Monday morning. I was very excited and promptly went home to do the deed at around 10am. Fast forward to yesterday morning and I wake up in my bed feeling like shit. I go to turn my alarm clock off and my hand just flops on top of it and refuses to work! 

It was actually kinda scary. My arm was numb from the forehand down and seemingly paralyzed. A bit of panic started to creep in as my best educated guess leaned towards stroke. 

This was bad enough, but shit got seriously weird when I noticed the hospital band on my other wrist, and the date on the alarm clock. 

WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!

Studying the band on my arm brought back a vague recollection of somebody taking my blood pressure but that was it, the rest was black.

I'm no beginner at this either. I've nodded out hundreds of times and OD'd a few too, but this was something new. The shitty feeling I had that morning was indicative of a shot a little on the heavy side, but that being said there was nobody to call an ambulance and if I had showed up at the hospital falling out or in a poor state I'm sure I would of received an antagonist. I've been on the receiving end of Naloxone before and I can assure you it's not something you forget.

I called the hospital and trying my best not to sound like an idiot attempted to put the pieces back together. Thankfully it wasn't a stroke. I have whats called drop wrist (pinched nerve essentially), most likely caused from being so high I slept on it funny without noticing lol.

6 week recovery! Fuck!! I'm using my good hand and one finger to type this by the way, and yes it's a bitch. Am I capable of writing a short post? Apparently not.

So to summarize, from what I've reconstructed; I shot up, nodded out, pinched a nerve, woke up, panicked, called a cab, went to the hospital, took a cab home, ate all my leftovers, smoked all my weed and then passed out again. All while my brain wasn't recording. 

The most fucked up part is that I'm more bummed that I couldn't remember how awesomely high I probably was :).",1381924233.0

A long story, I acquired around 1/4 cup (~2 fluid oz, I'm not sure how many ml) of a cough syrup called Tussionex, which is hydrocodone and chlorpheniramine, an antihistamine. It's an extended release deal, 1tsp=5ml=1 dose, every 12 hours. 1tsp~10mg hydrocodone and 8mg chlorpheniramine. 

I know with my tolerance 2tsp is feeling really nice, maybe even perfect. I'm only afraid of the stuff because I got the bottle after a close friend died ""of an asthma attack"", which I think was probably helped along with the rest of the bottle over the course of a couple-few days. (it was filled January 4th, she died less than a week later). 

It kind of sketches me out, but I don't have any money or cigarettes, I'm bored and sober, etc, so I took some. 

I guess I'm asking, does anybody here have any experience using Tussionex, what are your thoughts on the stuff? How much can I safely take, with the tolerance basically of a non-user (but with the experience and confidence of someone who does often dabble in drugs, including opiates and benzos). How much would you take? 

Thanks everybody, I hope this post is okay. It's a long rambling piece of shit, but I didn't have anywhere else to turn. ",1381878239.0

They had me fill out several forms and then had me pay $500. I filled everything out and within 15 minutes, the nurse was calling me to the back where she then took my vitals and then left me to wait for the doctor.

I'm sitting there, sick as hell; yawns are painful almost, I can't sit still-my legs are constantly jiggling, my stomach's aflutter and cramping every five minutes. Finally, after what felt like years, the doctor comes in. He introduces himself and we shake hands. 

My nervous/anxious feeling melts away when the first thing he says to me is, ""Congratulations. You're making a brave decision, and you're getting your life back."" I tear up, thinking back to the past 6 years, as the thought that I am actually doing this-I'm actually making steps to be clean, nearly overwhelm me. 

We talk for a few minutes while he asks me about my usage, my family and friends (support system), and then he asks how I'm feeling right now.

""Like hell,"" I tell him. He smirks and says, ""From what you've told me about your daily dose, I'm gonna start you at 16mg of Suboxone daily. One in the morning, one at night."" 

He writes out a prescription and tells me to go down the road where there's a pharmacy, and fill the script and bring it back. I do so, and when I come back, I immediately rush into the bathroom to vomit. When I come out, the nurse informs me I can go back, right away.

I go back and the doctor's waiting. He rips open a strip and tells me to put it under my tongue, and he'll be back in 10 minutes. It dissolves and I wait. When he get back, he tells me it'll take about 20 more minutes to work, and to wait to make sure it's effective at removing the withdrawal, and cravings.

I wait, and wait, thinking, ""Fuck, what have I gotten myself into? What if it doesn't work?"" Minutes pass. Just as I'm about to write it off as ineffective, I feel it. The withdrawal is fading away. That hollow, emptiness that the withdrawal creates is suddenly filled in. I become relaxed, and my body feels...*good*. *I* feel good. I feel *happy* and so much better.

When the doctor comes back, he immediately says, ""I can see it's taking effect,"" with a wide smile. ""So do you feel this is a good starting point?"" I nod, emphatically. He's glad, but cautious and rather than writing out the following script for 16mg per day, he writes it for 24mg per day. To start, he says.

So that's where I'm at now. I feel good. So good. So worth it. I have so much energy. I feel like I was never addicted in the first place. 

When my mom picked me up, she had tears in her eyes as she said she could see I was feeling better. They were tears of hope, I realized. I cried, long and hard when I got home, because I feel now that maybe my life's not over yet. Maybe there's still time for me to make something of myself.

I love opiates, and I know I'll never stop, but I just can't be a slave to them any longer. I cannot continue to live my life thinking only about opiates, and I need to actually *live*.

And for the first time in a very long time, I feel like it's possible. Like I can do it. Like I can do all the work I need to, to succeed. Like my life is on its way coming back to me.

And I'm ready for it",1381858514.0

I just don't like how they conduct business.) But anyway, so I've been coppin with a buddy of mine and we've been using his connect(s) the dope is MUCH better and the dudes are always punctual and on point. I have to give my boy one or two bags off every batch I buy for the middle man fee, but I don't really mind since the quality is much better and I'm not taking any risk.. he meets the dude, he carries the shit til we get back, etc etc. So breaking him off is no big deal. But so, back to my story. I met up with the first guy, who I used to go to all the time until he kinda fell off. So I call him and he tells me to go to our usual meet up spot. Now I don't really mind this place too much, because I'm comfortable being there now (its kinda ghetto, projects you could say) and being a suburban white kid I definitely stand out there, but I've been in there so much the residents recognize me and don't pay me too much mind. So I park up on this street and let him know I'm there. I end up sitting for about 5 minutes or so before he shows up. And usually he walks over from across the block, but today he drove over, parked in front of me amd signaled for me to walk to his car. As I'm walking to him some lady yells from her window ""NOT UH, NOT IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE PLEASE WHITE BOY! YOU BEEN PARKED DERE TOO LONG!"" it kinda startled me, but I yelled sorry back to her and grabbed my shit and was hopping in my car when she came downstairs and was yelling shit about calling the cops as she's walking out her front door. At this point I'm getting into my car and people are staring at the commotion. As I'm driving away she's still yelling about cops being on their way amd blah blah blah. Needless to say I got the fuck outta there REAL fast, haha. Anyone else ever have something like that happen to them?

I quit taking my painkillers last tuesday, making it 8 days since my last dose, and went through a pretty bad acute withdrawal that lasted for about 3 days. Since that third day, I have been experiencing some pretty bad anxiety and feelings of ""wound up"" for lack of a better term. I am wondering if I'm going through withdrawals still, or PAW's?

[serious but humorous] xpost health,"Crap I had just typed a whole freaking page of stuff and lost it, okay anyways I am 24, been diagnosed with migraines and status migranosis. I use to give myself shots of imtrex that's how bad they were well, I live in a small town and know my PCP and he wrote me a script for percoet which was a life saver. My PCP then started his own pain clicnic where he ins't a doctor, just over sees stuff okay well I usually went to ER 3-4 times a month to get headache aborted but this cost 2-3,000 dollars. Well the guy I see now at the pain clinic said if I ever had one that the abortive medication did work to come in and get a Sub-Occipital Nerve-block in the next following days it felt like someone had stabbed me in the base of skull with a burning red hot knife, right at the base of my skull, and neck, I told the FNP about it and he was like you probably jjust slept on it wrong well it hasn't stopped. Besides for when I got the block 1 more time in June.... It still hurt' just as bad and my pain doctor just shrugs it off. normally he would go super inquisitive and exclaimed that, there's no way it's from the nerve blocks he gave me the shot up higher than that, before the nerve blocks I could go 2-3 days w/o pain and right now its 24/7 now I have 0 relief besides when i take my roxicodone..... I figured it would at least be healed but now it just terrible not one single day w/o this horrible also I do not want to be taking my abortive medicine for this issue. It has been 4 months and still feels just as bad as the days it did afterwards. Another thing, the roxi doesn't get rid o f it, just takes it from a 10 to a 6/8ish... Anyways What do you think happened? It's obviously permanent nerve damage should I try to file a suit? I don't know I am just so upset my life was going so great and now I've got this bovine feces it makes it incredible hard to turn my head and or laying down... It seriously feels exactly like someone has a scorched red hot knife going into my neck and skull, and it's definitely from getting the nerve damaged or something, I am not sure... What are your thoughts? What would you do? And what are your thoughts on what could have happened? Should I file a suit? It seriously has done major damage to my life, since i've been writing this I had to get up about 10 times... My quality of life is now feces and I don't know what do I've tried all OTC meds and pain meds to no avail... Also doctors/neurologist what do you think happened? Will it ever heal or isit going to be like this the rest of my life? Please read and let me know, and what is the worst case scenario? Could he had done permanent damage? I want to wear one of those car wreck braces constantly so i don't feel like i'm getting stabbed Sorry this was o long i am just very saddened .... I am not the type of person to sue and I didn't sign anything saying I wouldn't...Do you think I have a basis for a lawsuit? I cannot keep a job as i work in tech support and just sitting here staring at screen is causing me terrible pain.... any advice would be appreciated and the last thing I want to do is sue a doctor who has helped me so much but i can't even drive my car anymore and can barely turn my head without being in excruciating pain 

TL;DR Got a nerve block done in my neck for migraines, fucked up my neck majorly. Doctor blows it off stating the shot he gave me was farther up than that.

In that time I've been on and off Methadone and Subutex scripts, the former of which helped me so, so much. When I was on Mdone I would rarely use on top, didn't have any depression or anxiety, basically life was as great as when I was using 'street' opiates just without the crippling cost.

But every time my family has always pushed me to come off the scripts, every time I've been happy they've hassled me to try and get clean, which I've always done, and has always lead to me giving up half way through the WDs and getting back onto H until I can sort a script again.  

I'm now in that situation again, they think I've been tapering off Subs but in actuality I've been using H.  
I don't want to be off of opiates at all, they help me so, so much. If it wasn't for the cost they would be the perfect drug for me.

I'd made it about 24 hours into WDs and just caved, shot a load of washed cottons and got a surprisingly ok hit out of it. Tomorrow I'm going to wake up sick and score as early as possible - I'd do it tonight but there's no way I could leave the house without them knowing something was up.

I've mainly sniffed, although I have IVed a number of times. Recently, I've been IVing more and more. I can't decide if what I am doing is really bad or what because I honestly don't know how much damage I'm doing or how risky this shit is. I know what I've been told, but I really don't know many people with a lot of first hand experience IVing drugs.

I usually use clean needles, and any time I re-use I flush the needle with rubbing alcohol before and after each use. Any time I think I may have missed part (or all) of a shot, I do a heat compress on the area by holding it under hot water and massaging it with my other hand. I try my best to keep all my equipment sterile. I use cotton to filter. I generally IV into one of a few sites, so I am hitting the same sites over and over again. My favorite site is the big vein right in the crook of my elbow, easiest to hit.

How risky is it that I get an abscess or something else? Will my veins start collapsing if I continue doing this? Should I be doing anything differently?

I really just need some input or advice from people who have done this for awhile.. How often do you end up having to go in for an abscess or something related to IVing? If I continue to IV, am I inevitably going to get an abscess eventually, or is it something that isn't very common? 
Is there any way to treat an abscess without going in to get it treated/ any chance my body can defeat one on its own if I ever get one?

Will it be obvious to me if I ever have an abscess (I know generally it is a hard painful lump under the skin at the injection site..)?

I had a whole super long post written out a few minutes ago, and somehow managed to delete it right at the end, so I'm going to do the short version.
Short version is this: was a user/junkie for many years. Got clean (I know people who wouldn't think of this as being truly clean, but my recovery is my own)with the help of diverted suboxone about a year ago. Friend and last source of subs has suddenly vanished off the face of the earth. I hear tell of a new boyfriend, lots of meth, taking off to Florida or someplace. Anyway, subs running out. I've done a lot of detective work to try to find another connection and no luck; calling every sub doctor in this half of the state to try to finally get on a real suboxone program and, so far, every one is already full (which is why I've been getting them off the street in the first place) Except one, quite a long drive from me can get me in 3 weeks from now.  Awesome! except....how do I get through those three weeks?! 
I wish I could take this opportunity to just get off of them, but I don't have enough to do any kind of comfortable taper, and I really do not think I have the strength to go through withdrawal any more. I have done it so much and I just can't take it any more.  I am terrified that I would just go back to the junk. 
Also am scared of hangin around my old haunts and the people I know from there...you know, just scared of falling back down the rabbit hole.  I was always a pretty solitary user anyway so I don't have a whole lot of friends in the game. I have found that I could score whatever OTHER opiates in a second, but not the one that I really need! Seems odd, where are all the people selling their subs for dope money?
I'm so scared to relapse. I actually have my shit relatively together, for the first time.  I'm a mom, and my son is doing so well in school, and we're just doing really good, and I want to keep it going that way. Hence my title for this post. 
Do you lovely people have any advice on how/where to find these things if you don't really know anybody and don't really have much of a life outside your little home-bubble anymore? 
Thanks so much if you read this.  any advice, tips, help, or even just commiseration can make such a difference to this girl.

I was 19-21 when I was partying.  I watched friends get addicted, go to jail, overdose.  I never seemed to have the same problems.  I never moved beyond snorting my dope.  I'd get high whenever I could, but I never really got that addicted, and when I quit I quit cold turkey, no problem.  I drank a lot at first, but I handled that.

  I had to quit due to legal reasons (lots of random drug tests).  So I just kind of moved on with my life.  I still enjoy opiates, I eat vicodin when I can get my hands on them, I had a nice supply of methadone for a half a year, I got some fentanyl patches once (those were nice).  But Lately I've really wanted to get a couple stamps and go to town.  My main problem is finding a connect.  

When I was using it used to be we'd just go to the west side of [redacted] and look for the guy shouting ""Rocks, Blows"".  I really don't feel like hitting the corners anymore, though.  What the hell do you guys do when you're in an area where you don't really know anyone that uses?

battling the same demon 

settling to just numb the fight

Just two simple ones.
1)From an outsider's perspective, what does somebody high on morphine act like? Do they slur their speech? Can they walk straight? Do they ramble? Anything helps, really.
2) What is it like to be on morphine? What is the high like? What do you think like? Does it make you tired? Do you hallucinate or experience other psychoactive effects?
Again, anything is helpful. I simply want I be able to write this character well and accurately.

Seeking Suggestions To Help Beat This/Beat Withdrawal.,"I'm new to this reddit, but read enough on here to want to create an account and post. Here is my story.

I'm 26 years old and have been clean for three days from roxy30s. I'm struggling a bit with this in my head more than the physical pain because I've been taking suboxone and tramadol?(i think?) to get through my days so I can do something besides lay in bed, sweat, chill, shake my leg, and be uncomfortable. It has been working, but have still had the desire to try and score, although I haven't been able to so I kinda don't have a choice. I feel depressed about my life and have wanted to score so I can not feel as miserable as I do about myself and how I got to this point, but I know that I am on the right track and just have to be strong and not throw it away.

I have a college degree and have been involved in the music industry for over 10 years. I'm not really sure how I got so reliant on the 30s, but I can see the damage it has done to my life. I was playing with 4 other extremely talented musicians in a band and gaining ground when i slowly started withdrawing myself from them, and they from me. I think i was most upset with myself that I had caused this rift and have been trying to repair this bridge, but I know getting clean has to be first. I've lost two jobs, one i had for over 10 years, one just last week I had for over 4 years. I swore i'd never do heroin but have even done that now a few times (snorting only, scared of hypodermic needles). I don't have a dollar to my name. My addiction has took the motivation out of me to do anything simple, even showering and cleaning up my appearance/taking care of myself. I've been trying to pick up a guitar again recently and write, as this used to be my ultimate high without drugs and want it to be again, but it's been hard to do so. I know things have been strained in my relationships with family, friends, and my girlfriend even, but they all love me enough and want me to get better. My family doesnt know about what has really been going on, but I feel they are suspect now and that is part of the reason I am trying to fix my life desperately.

I think I just wanted to post this to get a weight off my shoulders, but I also wanted to ask for some advice on things that could help me with the struggle. I have a strong desire to snort things, besides the suboxone and tramadol that are taken orally, ive found xanax helps, even doing cocaine helps solve that fixation, just wanted to see if anyone knew something else that could help with these feelings and help me continue to get away from opiates. Thanks for listening and for the advice ahead of time. :)",1382166861.0

I am of the opinion that this work is senselessly and pretentiously incoherent and vulgar just for the sake of vulgarity. While he is able to provide vivid imagery of the daily routine of the lower echelon of human society from New York to Tangiers, it isn't balanced by the fact that most of his writing is too unfocused. I appreciate the kaleidoscopic nature of his narratives and find some of his musings to be quite inspired, but I can't look back on the ""novel"" and reflect on it as a singular masterpiece. Needless to say, I was disappointed with him after all the hype; I was expecting his writing to strike me as coming from an amazingly brilliant source...

I've been creeping around this subreddit, and... I think it's time to be a part of the community.  i luv me some opiates.

I finished reading Narcopolis by Jeet Thayil, and that led me to smoking opium.  Now I feel inspired to write a story about a fictional group of people that decide to create their own opium dens funded by bitcoins... and, I thought, it would be lovely if some of you guys contributed to this project as well.  A group story of sorts, you know?  

I'm the only person I know in real life that's bananas about drugs - everyone else is really religious and straight laced about drugs.  it sucks sometimes, but knowing that such a community as this exists makes all of that anxiety over being different a thing of the past.

Here's a short excerpt, for instance:
-----------------
Prologue -

'This program has been brought to you today by the letter R!'

R.  The symbol of the gas constant.  The set of all real numbers.  In Latin, the littera canina (canine letter), trilled to sound like a growling dog.  Dogmatic, habitual.

Repetition, but with slow motion.  The astrological symbol of Saturn comes to mind here.  Heavy metal.  Surgical steel piercing veins.  The ceramic heating element slowly changing the state of the Spanish opium from the texture of hard malleable clay to a sticky liquid, then to a sticky-sweet smelling vapor full of alkaloids.  Memories literally burned into one's brain.

Ritual, but with high technology.  Cellular memories of a war long ago.  The British, on boats headed to China with boxes full of black plant latex chock full of dat RAW you just couldn't get enough of.  A nation, who defines a period of time based on a period of drug use & prohibition.  Young men in San Francisco, fresh off the boat in the early 20th century trying hard to make a living in the face of xenophobia and the lack of women speaking their native tongue.  They who found consolation in the presence of each other in the tradition they brought with them so many thousands of miles away.  [A bitcoiner, a typical 21st century reincarnation of Alexander the Great & Machiavelli (except with noble intentions), who invites a friend over... neglecting to mention that the room is filled with opium smoke.  A poisoner, bypassing the defenses of eyes, hands, ears to go for the mouth, the nose, the lungs... the aether, which we all breathe.  They will speak of a future beyond the control of petty politicians; theirs to shape as they see fit.  There is no rush.  They tell their friends, and friends tell their friends.  They proselytize, and wait.  The opium itself will do much of the heavy lifting.

Risk, but who gives a fuck?  There's so much at stake already.  Those who, in the immortal words of Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, 'have nowhere else to go.'  The stress of a mundane existence dominated by military-industrial complexes and privately owned fiat currencies, where one's well being oscillates predictably (y=1^-3x, to be exact) with each pay period.  The auras of red and black feature prominently in these spaces, among the populace who depend on the poppy for their happiness...

i knocked out the last jenga piece. as it usually does, my path of destruction and apathy caught up with me- and we all know where that ends up (going to rehab again). but let me tell you a story about how i went out with a bang.

a nice friend of mine, went out of their way to sell me a couple of bags of ECP. While we were getting high, we decided a trip to dunkin donuts was in order. i had a $50 walmart gift card, so i bought a copy of GTA-V and sold it at Gamestop for $20, bought myself a couple more bags. 

fast forward a couple of hours later. i learn that my spot got blown up, and i will be shipped out to rehab in the very near future. I arranged for a friend to take me back to Walmart with the promise that if he did some errand-running with me, I would make sure that he was well taken care of. A couple of flips and tricks later, I leave Walmart with a brand new $150 Nintendo Wii with the intention to sell it at Gamestop, grab a bundle and enjoy my last day(s) of freedom. I arrive at Gamestop and find out that they are willing to give me a total of $12.50 in cash for the $150 Wii that I just bought across the street. Bummer! What am I going to do now? I promised my friend he would be taken care of, gas money, we both want to get high. All of the pawn shops are closed. We spend some time outside Gamestop and Walmart offering the unopened, brand new console for $70 to passerby's, but no one takes us up on the offer. I decide to go back to Walmart, return the Wii for store credit, buy some games and go back to Gamestop. The service desk tells me that I can go pick out some games and they will do the exchange for me. I goand pick out $150 worth of games, trying to pick the ones that I think will yield the largest returns (GTA-V, Madden 25, some other game). Up at the counter, customer service checking to make sure everything is in the box. 

At this point, 4-5 people have been involved, I left a part out of the story where a manager had to get involved with these sketchy cards because they weren't clearing, I have a story going about my birthday, buying the wrong console, my little brother wanting certain games- a whole constructed fable to get me through questions and weird looks. Right as I'm about to receive and spend store credits on $150 worth of games to sell at Gamestop for maybe $40, my buddy says, ""Any way we could just get the cash?"". 

Lo and behold, that's no issue at all. At the point I can barely contain my excitement, my buddy has to nudge me and let me know that it's obvious I'm more than psyched about getting cash . I was probably drooling at that point. All of that bullshit, lies, store credits, etc and I'm going to end up walking out of there with $150 in cash. We get outside and spin each other around yelling in pure excitement.

Part Duex:
My friend has recently acquired a dealers number who was only ever available through a middleman. His bags are twice as good as any of the other dope that we can get. Dial him up- yup, come on through. I'm ecstatic at this point- lately I've been broke, stealing/lying/cheating and scraping just to get high maybe once a week, and I'm sitting on a cool $150 in cash that I basically got for free, and on the way to pick up some of the best dope I've done in awhile. We get to the park, and post up in the spot as directed.

Now this dealer is the type who refuses to answer the phone. He will text you, respond to texts, but just refuses to answer the phone. Fucking aggravating. We sit there for the normal 10-15 minutes, ring him a few times, not getting much of a response. What the fuck man, I want to get high. Every ten minutes, we get the ""Where r u?"" text from the dude- we're in the same spot, where you told us to go, where are you?! This goes on for about an hour. We keep pushing the endtime of calling someone else- 10 more minutes, we'll wait 10 more minutes. Finally we get the text we've been waiting for: actual directions of where to go to meet him. We bomb down the street, take a right and park. 15 minutes later, ""I'm walking down now- what car are you in?"". I can basically taste the dope in the back of my mouth. My rig has long been loaded with water, cotton balls rolled up, our personal spoons ready. Damn, my buddy told his mom he was going down the store to get cigarettes 2 hours ago. His girl and mom are blowing his phone up. No worries, dude should be here any minute. Call, call, text, text, call. No answer, no response. Call a mutal friend: ""Can you call [redacted] and find out what the fuck is up?"". No answer. Finally decide to call Dealer #2. 

No answer. WHAT THE FUCK? How is this happening? Money in hand, inevitable dopesickness looming in the horizon, promises to our bodies and minds that we would be getting high soon. Dealer #2 still not answering. And then it happens: ""I'm walking down the street"". Screeched tires, window rolled down, a quick ""Sorry man, I was waiting for my sister to drop it off"", and I'm holding 20 bags of Waterbury's finest ECP in my hand. Drive away, find somewhere to load up, and all of our worries, anxiety, and stress melt away with one push of the plunger. It was beautiful.



We had a lot going for us. We'd found the secret glue that held all things together. In a perfect place, where the noise did not intrude, our world was so very complete.
-Candy


And so here I am. I hooked my buddy up fat for adventuring with me, and I have a nice fat pocket full of fire dope to get me through until I head out to rehab, probably tomorrow. 

Happy nods to all, and to all a good night!

I'm mad that i had to tell my doctor i am a junkie, She knows me since a baby, If telling her was hard imagine telling my mother! 
So i decide I'm done! Thursday night was my last that is it. I was so certain i would/could do it. 
I made a plan i wrote all what i need to do down and bla bla bla.. 
So Friday morning i get out of hospital feeling a lil sick but nothing major.. The day before i seen this documentary about a prosy on the streets who had hiv she was a crack/heroin addict. Watching the thing i was sure she'd be dead now she looked awful like no hope. Only near the end isn't she clean... Of the streets, married and owns her own business, as well as going to schools and stuff sharing her story. She looked so classy i was shocked. 
She said she found Jesus i am not religious but thought it wouldn't hurt so on my way home i go to church i sit and have a chat..
I tell him i never wanted this life this isn't who i want to be i want to be a mother a wife a good friend a brilliant daughter, i want to be normal i want to be the person i was before all this shit.. I have a little cry and i ask my son to give me some strength i will need it. 

So i get home still positive but feeling a bit sick.. This is 10.am by 2.pm i had made the phone call and by 2.20 i am walking back with my gear.. 
I am so mad i couldn't even get a day, I am mad I'm so weak .. i can't even blame the sickness because it hadn't hit me yet... Yeah i felt a bit ropey but nothing major and as soon as the first cramp came off i skipped..

This is nice because when I do use a tourniquet, I find it really hard to find the vein and then remove the tourniquet without losing the vein.

I explained this to a friend and he told me what he does is push the plunger down and then quickly removes the tourniquet. I had read that this can lead to blowing out a vein, but he seemed to not have a problem doing this (should be noted he mainly only shoots into the large vein in the crook of his elbow).

So, I decided to go for a new vein on my right fore arm, about half way down in between my elbow and wrist. I tied a tourniquet such that I could easily see the vein. I had a bit of trouble registering, I think I slipped through the vein once, but I was able to register and do the shot. I pulled back to make sure I see blood after I finish the shot, and noticed that I did see blood (indicating I was still in the vein) but it came into the syringe really, really slowly. Because I was focusing on that, and the fact I normally don't have a tourniquet on, I forgot about it for a moment, and must have left it on for about ~3-5 seconds after finishing the shot.

Pretty much immediately after finishing the shot, I noticed an intense itchy-ness spreading from the injection site. As I was itching it, I also noticed a numbness spreading out from that area. I wasn't really sure what this meant, but I knew the itchyness was a histamine reaction. I figured I must have missed the shot, so I did a hot compress, holding the site under hot water and massaging.

This morning I woke up and noticed my forearm is bruised about 3-4 inches around the injection site. I looked it up, and read this is indicative of blowing a vein. I then tried tying a tourniquet, and sure enough, the section of vein near the injection site appears to be deflated.. Like, it doesn't bulge at all there, so I'm fairly sure I blew it.

What can I do about this/ how should I treat it? I had used a clean needle, filtered the shot (east coast powder) through cotton.. I dunno if I should be worried or not?

Also, for future reference, if I am shooting up alone and using a tourniquet, how can I remove the tourniquet after finding my vein but before pushing the plunger down without losing the vein? Seems really difficult.

TL;DR: Did a shot in a smaller vein in my forearm, and didn't remove the tourniquet until after pushing the plunger. Noticed immediate itchy-ness around injection site (histamine reaction) along with numbness. The next day (today) notice bruising around injection site, extending out to about 3 inches around the site, also notice that if I tie around my arm/ cut off circulation the vein appears ""deflated"" around where I IVed. I assume I blew the vein out, and want to know what I should do about this/ if I should be worried. Also how can I remove the tourniquet before pushing the plunger but without losing the vein?

When I was doing pills I had the same problem, I would sleep until 3 every afternoon and just do nothing.  

How do you guys do it?  Do you just hit the dope as soon as you wake up?  Today I thought I was going to throw up in the shower, like I was just already withdrawing maybe 12 hours after my last dose.  But I don't want to use on an empty stomach and get hit with nausea all day, either.  

To be honest I've been sick of Heroin since Thursday, but I'm just too busy to detox.  I fucking hate society.  I feel like Walter White in this bitch.  I should have just died already, I'm past my time. ",1382205565.0

I got my first Rx for Oxy about three and a half years ago and I've been on it ever since, in addition to a host of other meds such as NSAIDs and tumor necrosis factor alpha injections.  Currently, my rheumatologist prescribes me 40 mg Oxy (2 tabs a day) extended release.

What I'm curious about is my routine.  At the end of every month's Rx cycle I go off my Oxy for 5 days and instead take Tramadol; between (depending on the day and/or my level of pain) four to eight, 50 mg tabs a day.  I do this so that my tolerance to Oxy resets its self every month, preventing me from developing a forever increasing minimum dosage necessary for pain management.

Does anyone else here do something like this to keep their opiate tolerance in check?

Is there any risk/danger which can occur from switching between Tramadol and Oxy once each month?  (I've never had a seizure from Tramadol).

Am I a drug addict or drug dependent?  Is there a difference?  Yes, I get withdrawal symptoms if I don't have either Oxy or Tramadol and switching from Oxy to Tramadol for 5 days each month is mildly uncomfortable yet I can endure it.

Anyone else here begin their opiate usage due to chronic pain?

Thanks for your feedback!

My SO and I were standing outside, smoking a cigarette, chatting. We're not talking about much, just kind of commenting on the day we've had, how big the moon is, etc. Then, for some reason, the feeling hits me: I should run.

So I do, and I hear him behind me, following. Asking why I'm running. I tell him to just keep following me, that he'll see. We run and run, first past houses, then through a barren field, until we reach an area far from the lights of the small town we're living in at the moment. It's the river that separates both sides of the town, and it's entirely lit up by the full moon. 

It's surreal in it's beauty, the running water, the crisp cold air moving through the trees that bow down and touch the top of the river. There's not much sound except for the rushing water and the sound of us moving in the moonlight. We find a place to sit down and continue our conversation. He asks, after a while, why we ran over here.

I tell him the only thing I can think of at that point, ""Because we can."" No more, I don't want to waste my high by running around. No more, I'm too sick to do anything. If I want to, I can run until I find a pretty place to stop. I don't have to feel so stir-crazy anymore. I could travel the world if I wanted to. I can be social. I can have a job. I can do so much more now than I could just under a week ago, and the change is ridiculously large for as short a time period as its been. 

It's a beautiful thing and it only keeps surprising me with better and clearer feelings. Clarity and energy and happiness greet me now when I wake up.

I'm doing okay so far, and I hope I do better and better

I don't mean to over simplify it, but for the most part the consensus seems to be that most people here hate the drug outside of when they have it or are using.  It doesn't seem to be a secret that it controls your life. 

My question is to those that consider themselves addicts, when did you first realize that you were in fact addicted to your drug of choice. 

And to those that consider yourself ""casual users"", what is it that separates you from the addicts?

I know a little bit of chemistry to the point where I am willing to give this a shot (including the elution with chloroform, etc.). I may possibly sometime soon get a connect for pure oxycodone HCl powder and I am seriously thinking about giving it a shot. 

One problem: I'm stuck on the first line. When it mentions 3.15 g of oxycodone to mix with acid and the other chemical, is it referring to freebase oxycodone? Could I add a salt into the methanesulfonic acid, or would it not dissolve and/or fuck up my reaction? If I need the freebase to go with my reaction, how would I go about extracting it to freebase? Since it would be pure oxycodone HCl could I not just dissolve it in water and add ammonia until the freebase precipitates out?

I'd be really grateful if someone can answer this question. I'm not sure I'll go through with it but I'd still like to know the answer as I feel retarded not knowing what the answer is.

If all else fails I'll post this same question to /r/DrugNerds but they're only interested in psychs and stims apparently, so I'd much rather prefer if one of you guys answered it. <3",1382447299.0

So I stopped by a friend's house today for dinner.  Just before I left, his mother pulled me aside and asked if I could get her any weed.  She has severe back problems and is pretty much confined to her bed most of the time.  She started trying to justify it to me and said that the weed helps her get over the nausea from the medication she takes and she doesn't want me to think differently about her. (She has no idea about my history with opiates) Whatever, I don't judge.  

Now, I don't really smoke much but luckily for her (and for me as it turns out) my buddy just finished a sour diesel grow earlier in the week and I decided to buy a half oz.  After I told her about it she said she wanted to buy it from me but didn't have the money to pay for the whole thing at the moment.  Being that it was my childhood friends mom I didn't really care so I told her to just give me what she had ($50) and we'll call it even. She kept insisting that I come back in a few days to pick up the rest and I kept telling her it was ok not to worry about it.  (I felt really bad for her, she rarely got out and looked like she needed a break) Finally, she tells me to hold on a second and walked into her bedroom.  

When she came back she had a few bottles of pills in her hands.  I immediately saw the orange controlled substance label one of them.  She starts pouring the pills into her hand, telling me that sometimes she spends a weekend or more in a rehab for her back. When she is there, she says, they fully medicate her.  This means she has ""leftover pills"" at the end of the month.  She says that people always offer her money for her pills but she never sells them, she usually just saves them or ""FLUSHES THEM IF THEY EXPIRE"" (WTF!!).  

By this time she has a handful of pills. She tells me that these were the extra pills from last month and asks if they are valuable to me at all.  I can see some roxys and methadone on top of the pile. Doing my best to keep from noticeably salivating on myself I tell her I can take them off her hands if she doesn't need them.  When she hands them to me I realize that there is more than 40 fucking pills!  I tell her that I cant take all of these and her money too.  (Anyone else I would have not given a shit but it was my friends mom)  I give her the $50 back, throw the pills in my pocket, say goodbye and leave.

And heres the [**contents of my pocket**](http://i.imgur.com/yL76LJ2.jpg) when I got home.

Better yet, since I got the weed from a good friend I only paid $90 for the half of Sour.  May not be a huge score but I'd say today was a win.  Thought you guys would appreciate it.

**tl;dr Friend's mom wanted weed but didn't have much money.  Gave her weed that I got cheap from a grower friend for way less than its worth.  She feels bad and gives me her leftover pain pills from the month.  Got over 400mg of methadone and 300mg of oxy for $90 in weed. Win.**

I tell you guys, I just took a trip down memory lane, and it's strange. In a good way, I guess. It's been so long since I shot up crack, and it's just a reminder to me of what I've been missing out on. A reminder of the life I *used* to live. Back when I had a constant hustle, tight with the d-boys, always having a stash to tear into. A time back when people thought *sober* me was *high* me. The good ol' days. But I'm happy with this. A taste was all I needed. It's not something I'd hustle and go on the hunt for anymore. It's a rare treat for me when it ends up in my spoon, and that's what makes it special.  
  
It's been at least a 6 months, at least, since I touched the stuff. Not only did I manage to skate into some cash for a Dilaudid earlier, but I just gave one of my boys a ride to the guys place to pick up, and as is customary when picking up dope around here (locally this means crack) they broke me off a nice lil' hit. It wasn't anything to write home about, but generally a hit like this brings me right to the edge, just enough to get that rush, *almost* enough to puke, the perfect amount.  
  
I'll do a quick wash on it in about ten minutes, clean out my spoon, and go outside for a smoke and some fresh air. With coke/crack, this is a little tradition of mine. Unlike a lot of people I get pretty quiet when I do a hit, it's more of an internal thing for me and I always end up deep in thought. I guess it's a good thing I saved a little bit of my Dilaudid. It'll be a nice relief for when I start to come down in a little bit. So much for saving it for the morning like I was planning...lol...

One dude had something lined up, but it fell through. He did have some personals though, and for a ridiculous price I could have one. I don't want to even say how much because it's egregious.

Seeing as outlook for anything else was bleak, I paid the absurd amount for the 15 minute fun time. Did my thing and sat there slightly relieved but mostly remorseful. Just now, about 30 minutes later, guy calls me and said whoever came through. He offered me another one at no cost since he now has an abundance and felt bad for raping me on the price. Even is delivering it too, I'm without a license, which he is aware of.

She doesn't have an ounce of guile. Her kindness overflows into everything she touches. The way she treats animals makes me proud to be the human she chose to spend her life with.

She had a stent put in near her heart when she was 35. At 36 she had a heart attack, stent removal, and bypass surgery. This was a really big deal - they cracked her sternum and pulled apart her rib cage to get in there. You can still feel the wires that hold her together, and they cause her pain to this day. She's 39 now, and just had her third heart attack two weeks ago. They installed a defibrillator and blew sunshine up our asses.

This morning was the followup appointment. They were blowing more sunshine up our asses when my wife made my jaw hit the floor.

""Doctor, will I live another four years?"" She asked.

He pursed his lips and seemed to think for a minute, before responding.

""If you quit smoking and manage your bloodsugar, you could make it a couple more years longer than that even!""

I was flabbergasted. I know she is fragile. I know she is dying. I just always thought we had more time. A lot more time. We are just 39 years old! She is my first wife, and the only woman I've ever known that I wanted to marry. She is the best woman I've ever known. Her son, my son now also, Lorden, is 12. He has no idea of course. I'm not willing to discuss it with him until things are more immediate.

But I guess I've been in shock all day. I just grabbed her and held her close and cried so fucking hard. And I wanted to share that with someone, with anyone, because I can't talk about it with my mouth. It is too hard.

Thanks for listening, bropiates. Good luck to you all, stay safe, don't be stupid. Remember that there are people that love you.

Black Heart in the Devils Orchestra

Chapter One: Itch

Rebound. It only took two seconds for him to say it but I felt every millisecond of it. That word, that simple word. It lingered in my head as I bent over Benny Yo’s old wooden table. Re-bound, it repeated as if it was bouncing from all sides of mind. I don’t like to think of it like that. An argument formed and crystalized, blocking that hurtful word to my conscious. No, this wasn’t a rebound. This was a new opportunity, a new beginning and a new way of seeing the world. That bitter sweet feeling where every second is Christmas, your body goes numb, and you can do anything you want. Where you feel amazing! Then when it goes away you feel lower then you’ve ever felt in your life. But this was and still is my choice. And in that beautiful white powder I could, for the time it lasted me, feel like I was wanted or mattered at all.

 It lay out beneath me in a clean white line of bliss, and the second I arched over felt like I was moving in slow motion. I inhaled once more before reaching my destination and felt the beat of the stereo’s’ base hit my heart. “Hit it, you’re awesome Devon”. Then the word stopped echoing around my hardened head, but somehow its absence made it’s late presence all the more important. I stopped inches from the dope I’d bought with the last of my money.

 Eyes red I looked at him, and he stared right back. Tall, black, well dressed, aging well and handsome; he was my revise mirror. The slowing of reality began to return to its normal state and I only had one thought left: Why did I bring you, Thomas Mackay?   “You heard me, Devon! God dammit you’re better than this, if I’d know this shit I would have kicked your ass at the crib!” No words. My mind stopped working and there was just: absence. It’s like taking the drug didn’t make a difference, having it in the room made me spacey. Hovering over the white powder the only thing I could feel was fear, that the last of my money and happy thoughts were about to disappear with one swipe of Thomas’s right arm. Benny’s rug wasn’t where I intended it to go. “When? When’d you rebound? It’s been months, man. I thought you were better, I thought you were going to change” he said almost as if he were ashamed of me.  A word came into my mind, finally, so I spoke it before it faded away, “Now.”

“Now, like this time right now?”

“Yeah, I guess so. How long has it been again?” I was starting to feel normal again.  

“You want exact or rough estimate?” Thomas said rhetorically, “It’s been about four months and a week; you’ve been doing so good well, dog. I knew something was sketch bou’t this tonight you had that look in your eyes.” I didn’t have to ask him what I looked like, because I could feel my physical appearance shift during those times. It was as if I was trying to itch my mind. I’m sure it reflected in my appearance. Eyes different: dilated. Clothing ripped, stained, and bulky “Please, don’t do this Devon Heart, you’re my best friend”. This was my choice, I’m only doing it because I want to. If it was a rebound I wouldn’t even care what he said. I felt the urge to cry but looked down and remembered where I was and what I was doing. I bent down in a single second snorted the whole line. 

Happy nineteenth birthday, I said as I closed my eyes.

I'm actively looking to quit but these fucking doctors act like its a privilege to even talk to them to get the opportunity to try and quit. 

I've called just about every place within 50 miles of me and no one is taking on new patients. I wouldn't even mind the potential drive, I just desperately need to make a change in my life. I used to buy subs from a buddy of mine which I met on here actually, but he got locked up so it was back to H for a while. Which means it's back to being broke as fuck. I even payed like double the going rate for subs cause he was my buddy and he didn't get a ton, and that's STILL much cheaper than an H habit in the Midwest.

So I'm trying like crazy to get on subs myself, but even the ones that MIGHT accept new patients ask me a bunch of questions just for the doctor to look them over and decide if he WANTS to accept me as a patient. Then they just never call. I'm sorry I thought I was seeking medical treatment, not a personal favor. Guess I was wrong. 

Does anyone else have this trouble? What do you do about it? I'm in Indiana, though and I think we might be more strict about drug treatment than other states but I don't know.

Around beginning of this year, I attempted to quit. Made it 2 weeks but had few wd's, which I attribute to using low dose Naltrexone with my use (btw 1-3 mg). At the time, I also used Sub for 2 days as well..........

What is more interesting to me is when I started back again, I made the decision to never use unless I took Naltrexone on same day I used. Again, btw 3-5 mg. I took more once and the negative effects were pretty bad. Since I started again, I haven't been sick once and I have gone as long as 17 days w/out using. I am currently on another attempt to quit (financial reasons) at 6 days................

The Naltrexone does absolutely nothing as far as the mental cravings go (which is why I'm still using), but not having to worry about getting sick is somewhat nice............

I don't really advise running out and taking 3mg of Nalt to start as I started much smaller to assess how I dealt with it, but if you are able to detox and decide to use again, I would recommend looking at this as a harm reduction tool.

I was in moderate withdrawal when I started treatment. About an hour after letting it melt under my tongue I started to feel better and then that was it. I've been stuck in opiate purgatory since. Not high, not sick, not normal. 

Most of the jankies have gone (twitching, RLS, diarrhea, restlessness, insomnia), but I still don't feel right. 

Since taking the pill sleep has improved to sporadic naps no more than a couple hours long (not nodding at all), but generally still feeling exhausted. No nausea (I never puke, not even during severe withdrawals) or diarrhea since taking it either, and only minor temperature fluctuation and twitchiness. I also feel fairly foggy brained with a sense of general dullness (for example this has taken me an hour to write).

Obviously this is better than continuing withdrawals but it's not what I expected. I was imagining I'd feel normal almost a full day after taking the pill, but I'm far from that right now. Does anyone have an idea on how long it will take me to get right? I start back to work in 6  days and need to be operating at 100 percent mentally, if not physically, in a week at most. 

To clarify, I'm on one 8mg sublingual taken daily. My next dose is in 4.5 hours. Also, does anyone in the UK know how long it generally takes to stop having to take the treatment under supervision? I'm an American living here now for work so I'm unfamiliar with UK policies, in America they give it to you for a month at a time. And it's orange flavored/flavoured...

Thanks in advance. Oh, I was on .5 a day for about 3 years this time. But have been using more on than off for the past 17 years (since I was 14).

Does anyone else have similar histories/treatment plans that they've worked successfully? Thanks in advance.",1382497833.0

I have been doing oxys and other painkillers for almost two years now. However I think I have a good thing going with them that I am not physically addicted to them (but def mentally addicted to em put who cares I love the fireplace feeling in my stomach). I will do opiates two to threes time a week for a week or two but then take 1-3 weeks off depending on how hard I went the last time. So i guess what I am asking in a very convoluted way is heroin much more addicting then oxy and will it cause me not to be able to keep up what I have been doing with opiates for two years, which has allowed me to enjoy opiates, while not fucking up my life.

take your children and thats just the start.
I'm more costly than diamonds, more costly than gold
The sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.
And if you need me, I'm so easily found,
I live all around you, and hang around town.
I live with the rich, I live with the poor,
I live down the street, and might be next door.
My power is awesome; test me youll see,
But if you do, you may never break free.
Just try me once and I might let you go,
But try me twice and I'll own your soul.
When i possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie,
You'll do what you have to just to get high.
The crimes you'll commit, for my narcotic name,
To you its worth the pleasure of me in your veins.
You'll lie to your mother, you'll steal from your dad,
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.
But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised
I'll take over you conscience and shorten your days.
I take kids from parents and parents from kids
I turn people from God and seperate from friends.
I'll take everything from you, from your looks to your pride,
I'll be with you always, right by your side.
You'll give up everything, your family, your home
Your friends, your money, you'll be mine and mine alone.
I'll take and take til you have nothing more to give,
When i'm finished with you, youll be lucky to live.
If you try me be warned, this is no game,
If given the chance, i'll drive you insane.
I'll ravish your body. I'll control your mind.
I'll own you completely, your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed,
The voices you'll hear from inside your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see,
I want you to know these are all part of the poison of me.
I'll strip you of faith and be your only love.
You'll lose all hope, I'll be all you think of.
You'll regret that you tried me, they always do
But you came to me, not I to you.
You knew this would happen, many times you were told,
But you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
You could have said no and just walked away,
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
I'll be your master, you will be my slave,
I'll even go with you when you go to your grave.
Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? Its all up to you.
I will bring you more misery than words can tell,
If you take my hand, I will drag you to hell!",1382486817.0
1p0hic,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1p0hic/i_think_i_almost_odd_after_doing_a_speedball/,11,https://redd.it/1p0hic,bitterwater,I think I almost OD'd after doing a speedball,"Hi r/opiates, I've been lurking here for a while but this is my first post. I'm breaking my silence because I just had a horrible scare and I feel a need to tell somebody; I also hope that somebody might learn from my experience and be deterred from repeating my mistake.

Earlier today I tried cocaine for the first time. It felt great, everything it was supposed to be, so I imagine it was fairly strong. I have enough experience with speed to know that it was not cut with anything like that, so I believe that the only active drug I ingested was the coke. About 20 minutes later I snorted a small amount of heroin with the intention of taking the edge off the impending comedown. This worked great and the combo gave me the best high I have ever experienced; energy and confidence mixed with that warm cosiness we all know and love. At this stage I still felt perfectly safe. After about 4 hours the cocaine seemed to have mostly worn off so I thought it was safe to take a proper dose of H. This soon got me to where I wanted: just short of nodding off. It felt like a standard heroin high, perhaps a little more euphoric than usual.

An hour after doing the second line of H (5 hours after taking the coke) I realised that things were going seriously wrong. Although I was conscious, I was physically displaying the symptoms of a heavy heroin dose. My breathing became shallow and would have totally stopped if I hadn't consciously forced myself to inhale and exhale. Despite a rising sense of panic I managed to get outside and go for a walk in the cold, keeping myself awake and concentrating on getting air into my lungs. After 30 minutes the danger had passed.

I am finding it hard to understand how this could have happened. Obviously the cocaine potentiated the heroin at the same time as hiding its effects, but how could it do this 5 hours after I took it? Plus, I had always thought that speedballs killed by causing cardiac arrest, not by depressing breathing. It is horrifying to think that if I had taken a little more H I would have nodded off and probably stopped breathing altogether. I thought I was being careful - I never suspected how easily this combination of drugs can sneak up on you. Can anyone relate to this? ",1382485548.0

I need 2 30's or 2 tenths of dope to even feel anything. Can't afford it, so today i bought a generic subutex (it says 54 411 on the front, i'll post a pic if anyone needs to see) and Im starting the break tomorrow. I've done subs before but my tolerance is way higher than it used to be, so I was just wondering the best way to use this thing. I've heard that snorting them burns like a bitch and my friend tells me if i shoot it 1/4 at a time it will even get me high, which is great. So im just asking you guys for some second opinions. It's a white pill, about twice the size of a roxy with 54 411 on the front. I want to use the pill as economically as possible (keep me from being sick, but I'd love to make it last 2 days if i can) but if shooting it is safe and might get me a buzz, I'll definitely go that rout. You guys think shooting 1/4 of it at a time is the best way to go for what I want out of it? Maybe shoot 1/4 of it around 2-3 in the day and then another later at night, will that keep me well all day with a medium tolerance? If I dont get high that's ok, but i'd rather not shoot it if it's not going to get me high and i can just swallow or snort it. Thanks for your help!

edit: i should mention that i have only shot twice before, and it was last week. so missing the vein and fucking up my arm shouldnt be too big of a concern right? Im still at the stage where i have an experienced buddy of mine do it for me so i dont miss and waste my shit.",1382485372.0

In a case like this, with a certified prior diagnosis, would the prison doctor continue prescribing the oral opiate medication the inmate received while they were free?  

Could an inmate's doctor from the free world petition/contact the judge and/or prison doctor to help legitimize the necessity of an inmate's continued use of opiate medication (despite the patient having a non-life-threatening disease) while inside?  Would this make a difference?  Could the inmate sue the corrections department if they were denied opiate medication despite a prior diagnosis and medical evidence like blood work & X-rays?

I know this is a slightly ridiculous question with so many factors to consider.  Each U.S. state, most likely, has differing policies in regard to inmates being prescribed opiate medications, especially if it's on a continuing basis.  But, don't prisons have a legal obligation to provide comprehensive medical care to all inmates?

Hello all, been lurking this sub for a couple weeks figured i'd finally post something. These little babies are the generic Oxymorphone IR's 10mg (54 814) my favorite opiate by far. Just picked up 16 of these for $100. Damn good deal. I do H but I can never find any in my city. I know it's there but I don't want to run the risk of finding a half ass dealer who will only be able to sell sometimes thus forcing me to withdrawal on his terms, which is what happened when I was getting into it. FUCK THAT. 

Anywho I hope you all are having a good day and are currently nodding as much as I am (crushing up pill #2) and I hope i'm accepted here lol.

HAPPY NODS EVERYONE. 

btw sidenote: Does anyone have actual experience IV'ing these? Really wanna try it this weekend but of course I wanna do it RIGHT. Some tips on prepping and getting all the binders out would be greatly appreciated. Please go into details I would like to be thorough. Thanks :)

He won a lot of battles during his life, but unfortunately he lost the war to a subarachnoid hemorrhage.  
**`````````It gets pretty emotional after this so, move along if you wish```````**  
I am eternally grateful to whomever or whatever it is residing above us that granted me permission to arrive to the hospital in time to see him come out of surgery alive. I shoved several healthcare workers back disregarding their opinions that he needs his rest. No, bitch, I NEED MY DADDY TO HEAR ME.  
Seeing him like that... intubated, chest making dramatic motions as his lungs function with the aide of machine.. any composure that I had summoned left my body at that point.  
I crouched down next to him, mindful of the copious amounts of artificial ingredients sticking out in every direction from a skull, a *FACE*, that I was once able to recognize from 400yds away. His features were so mangled it could have been a Picasso painting. But he still smelled like my dad..  
Dodging his wounds, I found one of his sweet spots on his hairline and traced my fingertips across it one by one.. left to right.. right to left..   
""Dad? It's me, oxymorphjayhawk. Dad, I love you *so much*. I can't take back the things that I have done to you and mom over the years. I feel like I should say sorry but those five little letters are meaningless right now. What I can offer you is this: From now on, if you make it out of this, you will never have to worry about me lying to you or to mom *EVER AGAIN.*   I can't promise that I will be AA sober, but I will be oxymorphjayhawk sober, and that makes me happy.""    
""Ultimately, I know that you simply wanted me to be happy, so please.. please understand that for the first time in 25 years, I truly feel grateful to be alive. I can look in the mirror today and be proud of her! I look in the mirror and I see my father in the background with his only child in the foreground and for *once*, both of us are practically beaming because we both know that you have done your job as a father.   You have taught me everything you could. You did your job as a father and you won father of the year 25 times as far as I'm concerned. I love you, Daddy. Please don't leave. Please, just go hiking with me one more time. Please, let's just take one more trip to Woolaroc. Just one more marathon of the Military Channel? Please..?""  
I know this is probably not the best outlet in which to share my grief, but I feel safer discussing this with like-minded strangers on the Internet than I do if I were to say this on social media. Besides, homegirl really needed to follow through with an update as per some requests.  
He taught me to be kind, be observant of others and provide assistance when necessary/safe to do so, and most importantly, he told me to always keep walkin'. So that's what I'm gonna do.

I asked on another forum and they directed me here.

In January of 2012, I had a stomach puncture that also became a series of ulcers. It was serious stuff, I almost died from the ordeal. Anyway, after release from the hospital, I was on a liquid diet for awhile. I was also in a lot of pain. I couldn't take any oral painkillers so, my doc gave me some lollipops that made me dizzy and nauseous (fentanil?). Those didn't work so he put me on another drug that I just dissolve them under my tongue.

What he had prescribed me was 1mg of buprenorphine twice daily. I found that after the first two doses of 1mg, it was WAY too much. I couldn't even keep my eyes open. I told him that and he insisted I continue to take it as prescribed stating that any less of a dose would have no effect. Well, I ignored him. I found that over the next few days if I cut the 2mg strip into 8 pieces (.25mg each) and took one of those pieces in the morning, it was perfect. Pain was gone and I was happy.

Thing is, it also had an unintended side effect. Since I was 18 (more than 15 years ago), I've had something called depersonalization. I've never been formally diagnosed because I've been able to deal with it myself. It's definitely ""there,"" but more of an annoyance than a crippling condition.  When I take this drug, though, the DP goes away completely. I can think more clearly and I feel like my old self.

Well, as you all can imagine, over the next 3 months of taking the drug, I was hoarding all the extra. I was finally cleared by my doctor to go off the meds and, in his mind, I did exactly that. Except, of course, I didn't. I continued taking the 1/8th strip every day and it continued to work wonders for more than a year.

A few months ago, I noticed my ""extras"" were getting low, so I started skipping days. I observed that if I went 3-4 days without, the DP feeling slowly crept back in. I recently skipped an entire 2.5 weeks while on a business trip and I could definitely tell the DP was back and I was feeling ""off"" again. Again, it's very minor, but I still don't quite feel like ""me"" if you can understand that. 

I decided to go back to that doctor and come clean to see if he'd put me on it long term at .25mg per day. BIG MISTAKE. When I told him this a few months ago, he became visibly upset. Since then, I've seen 2 other doctors about this. I explained the entire story and neither was willing to do anything. One even scolded me for ""playing with fire"" and seeking VERY dangerous drugs. I can see where he's coming from. When I took the full 2mgs at the beginning of this ordeal, I definitely felt very drugged up, though it wasn't all that pleasant.

The second doctor also said there was no way to do this as there are almost no doctors that can even prescribe the drug. Sigh.

I'm at an impasse, really.  Is there anyone I can see about this? The DP is not a crippling illness by any stretch, but I certainly feel better when I take the .25mg. Is there anything I can do? Any type of doctor that I can see? Will they laugh me out of the office?",1382642747.0

1. Chinga babies- after you have been hooked on opiates for any period of time, you can no longer poop well on your own. When you enter a period of sickness, you may give ""birth"" to a chinga baby. This is when you suddenly have to poop and an enormous hard poop the length of your colon decides to come out an an inopportune time tearing apart your booty.  

2. Coagulated blood hits- when you cannot find a vein, you may put a syringe clogged with blood and dope to the side. At some later time, a few hours or even a day down the road, you may rethink that hit. I have taken the liquid out, picked out the clots and stuck that right back in my arm. I also did a few of Ben's coagulated blood hits. Ahhh love! 

3. Impotence- Shhh. It's a secret unless you have ever fucked a male addict. After awhile, things do not work in the nether regions. Unless they take a hit of crack or speed. Then, he is too busy looking for white specs on the carpet to get busy. 

4. No periods. Yes ladies, your period may stop. Or you thought it stopped but you actually are pregnant but did not know because you have not had a period. 


5. You may very likely fall asleep with food in you mouth. Amazingly, you may just re chew and swallow that same tasty morsel later. This may be something along the lines of grahamn crackers, a cinnamon roll, etc. As yummy as it sounds, it is WAY better than trying to spit that stuff out with a pasty mouth. 

6. If you nod off next to a person who is also nodding, they may burn you. There is nothing more irritating that waking up to your shirt or the bed on fire. Add a few klonopin in that mix, you may wake up engulfed in flames. 

7. No matter how many times you say you will cuss the connection out, you never will do it. You will wait patiently in the rain for 1-2 hours envisioning acts of violence on said dealer then thank them when they hand you your stuff.

8. If you are selling drugs, everyone hates you. Yes, I know, you also use them so you think it is cool. It is not- they hate you. Trust me. Worse than a junkie is a junkie that then sells drugs- you have betrayed the sacred order of the spoon.

9. If you have never had sex with an ugly person for drugs, keep using…

10. The first one after rehab or jail is always free. After that, you will be paying thousands. There is no “free heroin”. It goes into the cosmic bank of suffering and misery likes company.

Then someone told me it was the first IV use that's like that, so my question is, do you feel the same rush everytime you use?

*And all should see him standing there,*

*and all should cry ""Beware! Beware!""*


*""His flashing eyes! His floating hair!*

*Weave a circle 'round him thrice*

*and close your eyes with holy dread,*

*for he on honey-dew hath fed,*

*and drunk the milk of Paradise.""*



*-Samuel Taylor Coleridge*



In a haze of pain and painless bliss, partly from the illness that the doctors initially chose to counter with Laudunum, and partly from the pain of opiate withdrawl, our great poet sat in his cottage and wrote Xanadu, until he was interrupted by the knock of a stranger at his door.

I've looked up as the rush of injection took me, and felt my flashing eyes and floating hair. I'm sure I didn't actually look supernatural, but I FELT every bit of it. Hyper atuned to the world around me, the elements seemed at my beck and call. The static in the air as a storm gathered felt like my own power, radiating in an ever expanding spiral around me. 

At the hight of my amphetamine induced psychosis, I was convinced that I'd mastered telepathy. That I could pull the truth out of people's heads willy nilly, and I scared the shit out of a great many people proving it. I am, unfortunately, both incredibly perceptive, insightful, and a student of psychology, so much like a huckster with a deck of cards or a crystal ball, I seemed preternaturally talented in this regard. The problem, of course, was that I was moon-barking mad and actually believed in my own power.

Weave a circle round him thrice and close your eyes in holy dread - these refer to ancient folk rituals for warding evil, and to pure, unbridled fear. Coleridge was writing about himself transformed into a figure of power, worthy of dread, necessary to be warded against. All because he had fed on honey-dew, on ambrosia, the milk of Paradise, allowing him to assume aspects of the Gods.

Nothing written elsewhere, prose or poetry, has ever resonated with me so strongly. I eventually recovered from my madness, and no longer believe myself capable of reading other people's thoughts, though when I think back on it I am astounded at how good my guesses were, and at how well I manipulated people into giving me clues without being aware of it myself and without them realizing it at all either.

Every time I shoot heroin, I mutter to myself ""milk of Paradise..."" and when I was in prison, I etched this section of the poem into the concrete of every cell I was ever sent to.

Do any of you have stories about art profoundly affecting you, especially in terms of your drug use? For me it was a poem, but I can easily see it being something else for others. Music, perhaps, or a painting or drawing. Maybe it was art you created, rather than art you simply appreciated.

My father is enraged with me, furious. He shouted and screamed at me on the phone for not picking up as he called me all day. But I was sick, throwing up, and trying to cop.

Mind you the on ramp is a few hundred feet in the air so when we were going head on to the wall everything slowed down and I literally told myself this is it, this is how i'm gunna die. Luckily the wall stopped us. Then some ppl pulled over to help us out cops came and all that. 

I AM SO FUCKING LUCKY the cops did not breathalyze me. I told them I was DD which was true to some extent my friend was completely smashed and asked me to drive. I do have alcohol in my system (1 mixed drink and maybe 4 shots). Definitely not enough to even seem drunk as I am a pretty heavy drinker when I drink and I can easily take 15 shots plus a whole bunch of mixed drinks to get hammered (Not bragging at all). I know when I should and should not drive after drinking and I knew for a fact I would be able to drive and alcohol definitely was not a factor. I just hit the corner to fast and lost control. 

So yes things could be WAYYYY worse I could be in jail right now. I just feel so bad my friend is not a rich person and I doubt her insurance is going to cover anything since it wasn't her that was driving. Idk how i'm going to be able to afford this.

So I did then we sorted more stuff out and he asked my friend's mom to take me home so when I got in her car I called my friend to tell him nvm I had a ride but he said he was right around the corner, so I got out and told the cop my friend was already back and he fucking yelled at me because my friend came back.

So he won't talk to me know, not since letting me know that he was at the end of his rope with me. He's terrified that I'll go back to prison and end up irreparably damaged. I stayed up late and wrote to him of my plan, first to switch addiction from methadone back to heroin before going to rehab, so that the withdrawal will be shorter. My next step is to quit heroin cold turkey and immediately begin Loperamide replacement therapy. And I wrote at great length about why I was doing things the way that I am, about the risks and rewards, and how I really did think it could work. Most of all, I was honest, as I always am with my father.

He still won't answer my phone calls 24 hours later, but he sent my youngest brother, Paul, the hospital worker and medic of our family, to check on me. Paul brought his girlfriend, and together they helped me clean my house. I'm a neat freak, but with my wife hospitalized so much and a 12 year old son desperate to get out of cleaning chores at all costs, things have piled up around here. Better still, they both made me show them everything about my business so that while I'm in rehab, they can come on the weekends and verify that the ship remains on course. They've also convinced my other younger brother, who lives much closer, to do the same. I've been trying to get the family involved in my business from the beginning, but they've never had the time. Now all these potential disasters that have me on the verge of a heart attack are being addressed one by one. I think tonight I'm actually going to be able to sleep okay for the first time since I failed that first piss test for my PO.

So, while many things remain grim, from my wife's health to my businesses health to my prospects for recidivism, my family is beginning to close ranks around me and chip in to the defense. I'm so relieved. Also, you guys have been awesome, listening to me and talking to me and distracting me through many a very dark hour lately.

I'm 100% atheistic, but I honestly feel... blessed just now. I hope these blessings continue to fall into place around me, and that I am able to keep the life I worked so hard to build for myself after my release from prison. I hope eventually that I'm able to redeem myself in my own eyes, and in societies as well.

But that being said there are some times and places where a rig just isn't accessible and or appropriate. That's where these puppies come in handy. 

The other day my friend introduced me to the ""snuff bullet"". It's a little cylindrical aluminum thing with a screw cap on one end where you put the dope in, a valve in the middle, and a hole at the other where your nose goes. The idea is you fill the compartment with dope, screw the cap on, turn the valve and take a sniff. The valve actually automatically measures out .1g's from inside the compartment and delivers it up your nose. The compartment will hold 1.5g's so you can fuck yourself up as much as you wish. 

The real genius is the hole where your nose goes. It's cone shaped so when you sniff, the powder shoots out in all directions evenly coating your nasal cavity unlike a straw which rockets a lot down your through and into your lungs.

He only sold to my middle man in bulk (more than I could afford) who then proceeded to mark up the shit out of the price before I got my hands on it. 

I figured if I could bypass this middle man I'd be golden. But why stop there? I'd like to think I'm a pretty bright guy and with a major in toxicology I took on the opiate addicts dream; to skip the dealer, trafficker, synthesizer, refiner and farmer all in one go.

You learn and practice botany quite a bit in toxicology so getting papaver somniferous seeds to sprout and grow was not a daunting task. They where planted in my back yard along a fence line and where tended to almost daily. Many died, where eaten or stunted (mother nature does what she wants when she wants) but I still ended up with a crop of 9 pods after 8 months. This yielded just under 1.5g of sticky opium latex. I dissolved, boiled, filtered and reduced the plant product into a more refined substance which proved to have a good morphine and codeine content upon analysis. I IV'd the entire 1.1g left after filtering within 4 days. It was a good 4 days don't get me wrong, much like IV'd morphine, but it was no Heroin.

Rewinding back 3 months, upon noticing the strength and resilience of this plant along with the success of my first grow I planted 80+ more plants in 5 locations along the back acres of a friends farm with his permission. Boy was I glad I had planted more when the first batch in my back yard turned out so great!

It was a long semi sober 5 months before the second crop was ready for harvesting. This batch was far less successful unfortunately. Due to my inability to visit my babies regularly the birds, slugs and weather had done serious damage. In all I was able to salvage only 55 pods out of the 71 that sprouted. 

I once again proceeded to score and collect the heavenly nectar that spilled forth (a very therapeutic process I might add). After a basic dissolve, filter, reduction, I was left with just over 7.5g of raw opium :) 

This is where I decided to take things beyond the realm of the normal opium grower. Synthesis!!

The synthesis from morphine to diamorphine is not incredibly difficult but there are a few important steps which if overlocked will have you crying over your lost product (as I found myself at one point).

The hardest part about the synthesis is really just obtaining the solvents and chems. Especially of a proper chemistry grade. NO, engine primer will not work as I found out. You need medical grade ether haha.

I won't go too deep into the actual synthesis, but I will tell you the diamophine is eventually synthesized out of a solution as a precipitate (a solid that forms and removes itself from a liquid solution). Unfortunately precipitates almost always mean a low yield relative to the original mass being synthesized. 

My first attempt was on one gram of opium and it ended fucking horribly! Like an idiot I misread the indicators on the PH strips and ended up with a opium ether solution (I wouldn't recommend IV'g this lol). 

I thought this was a failed exercise at this point and I'd never achieve Diamorphine. However my curious mind got the better of me so I said fuck it and tried another gram. This time with a PH that was still far off from the original experiment as done by Charles Wright (my hero), small white flakes precipitated out and proceeded to float to the bottom. After filtering and drying I was holding 0.2 grams of the purest diamorphine I will likely ever see! I couldn't fucking believe it!

I went ahead and started working on the remaining opium in 0.5 gram batches, making tweaks to the ph as I went. I fucked up twice more before finishing off the 7.5g's and lost about 2 grams total.

In the end I had 1.1 grams of very very pure heroin!! I cut the resulting heroin down to make it more manageable for IV and I ended up with 2.5 grams. Even with more than a 50% cut it was the strongest dope I've ever had. 

I've done many more complicated basement experiments (Methamphetamine, MDMA etc.) but none have made me as proud and happy as this one.

Looking back 2.5 grams for 8 months of work and stress really isn't worth it at all. Especially considering I spent more in chems, planting materials and lab equipment than 2.5g's is worth. So no I didn't ""beat the system"" lol. I guess I just wanted to prove to my self it was possible.

If I had a large field, lab supplies straight out of breaking bad and no job I really think I could get a constant production line going and be happy for the rest of my life! One day maybe :)

I'm not willing to take the risk of growing 80 plants again (especially as I live in the city now) but as I type this there are 2 beautiful plants growing on my window sill. Not enough for a synthesis but hey, it makes me happy just looking at them.

If you want to know more details about the process please feel free to message me :)

Wouldn't opium in its raw form have some medical advantages in certain situations?

Couldn't doctors just give a patient an Rx for a specific dosage of opium to swallow/eat or dissolve in tea?  Why don't doctors do this anymore?

I know some medical problems/emergencies require powerful, chemically processed opiates to be administered via differing ways.  Of course, a doctor wouldn't give a burn victim raw opium with an oral route of administration, but this doesn't mean a different patient couldn't be prescribed a controlled & measured dosage of opium to dissolve in tea or eat.

Why has the medical option of prescribing raw opium for some patients been totally removed from a doctor's list of choices for pharmaceutical, opiate analgesics?

I have come to enjoy the process of experimenting with various relatively soft drugs, recording and comparing my differing states of consciousness. So far, I have been able to responsibly manage my drug use and haven't felt any negative consequences.

Opiates intrigue and scare me. While I can mostly convince myself that psychedelics are the branch of drugs most relevant to my interests, I can't kick the nagging feeling that I should try an opiate once, just so I have a point of reference and can effectively tick them off my list of experiences. And if I am to take one opiate once, hell, why not make it heroin? 

Such is my question: If I source a single dose of heroin and decide very firmly in my mind that I will take it once, get as much out of the experience as I can and never touch the stuff again, how likely is it that I will be able to keep such a promise to myself? Could the addiction, psychological or physiological, really come on strong after one dose, especially if I don't have particularly easy access to more?

As a side and possibly relevant note, if I was to perform such an experiment, I think I would probably be inclined towards plugging as my method of administration. It seems to me that if I did it properly, it would give me the fullest experience, second to IV, which is something I really don't want to try. Any advice relating to this particular method would also be very much appreciated.

Here are some facts I got from the book that I thought you guys might appreciate:

- Theophrastus, a Greek philosopher, writes about how annoying tolerance is.

- They plugged and snorted their drugs.

- Most families had poppy plants in their gardens.

- Opium was referred to as ""the juice"" because it was so common.

- They used to drink opium mixed with wine at parties.

- Aristotle describes nodding: ""opium... produces a heaviness in the head; and persons borne down and nodding all seem affected in this way, i.e. they are unable to lift up the head or the eyelids.""

- Pliny describes the process of collecting opium: 

""From the dark poppy a soporific is obtained by making incisions in the stalk, when buds are forming (as Diagoras advises), or when the flowers are falling (as lollas recommends), at the third hour of a clear day, that is to say, when the dew on the plant has dried up . . . Both this juice and that of any other plant is gathered in wool, or if there be but little, by scratching it off... Poppy juice however being copious thickens, and squeezed into lozenges is dried in the shade; it is not only a soporific, but if too large a dose is swallowed the sleep even ends in death. It is called opium"" (Like in Vice's Heroin Holiday: http://www.vice.com/en_uk/Fringes/heroin-holiday)

- The word ""morphine"" comes from Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams.

Yay. Not. I had anxiety all night and had no internet to keep me calm. I can't keep doing this. Spending a thousand a month on dope is stupid. I could be using that for school or some shit. I'm currently looking up outpatient rehab places, but to be honest I don't know how successful this will be since I'm around drugs daily. And Vegas doesn't seem to have any city funded programs and there's no way I could come up with the money to pay for rehab up front. I have been getting by everyday with the dope. I don't know if I can save the money.

I have been asking people for a place to stay away from drugs and haven't got a response. I'm guessing that's a no. They want me to get clean, but refuse to help. How nice of them. I know that this is all on me, but fuck it would be nice for some support and a place to stay away from drugs. I don't know, I'm researching and such and I hope I'm ready. Selling my phone, the last thing I could sell, made me think. I can't keep doing the daily hustle thing. Not with my anxiety and shit. It fucks with my mental health.


I'm being realistic, I might not come out of this without relapsing. As long as I make those times small incidents instead of full blown addiction, it will be good. If I can get away from everything, it would be even better. Not sure squatting another city is smart and I don't really have any friends who are sober that want to help me with a place.

I went to do my last shot, and did it in the crook of my right arm, where registering is usually a mere formality. I'm always in and stay in. This time I can't register and jam around for a minute or so trying to register.  

When I pulled out after giving up the most blood I have see after a needle going into my arm came out. It dripped onto the floor, covered the crook of my arm, and I had what looked to be a nice lump, or sub dermal hematoma I guess? I washed and bandaged  it.

Ruining my life on fast forward. Trying to get by with a little help from my friends in this sub. Thanks in advance.,"Long time lurker here. I love you guys, that's why I'm really sorry about the incoming wall of text...

I was a regular h user about four years ago. I got off finally after about a year, 60 thousand dollars, countless ruined relationships, and help from God (no other way to explain it) 

I've since relapsed twice with maybe a dozen or so chipping excursions here and there. The first one had me quitting a great (50k + bonus job because I couldn't even pretend to be sober at work) 

The second relapse started last Tuesday and fuck am I going down fast. Family knows, friends know, bank account knows, I'm isolating myself fast and ruining my health even faster. I'm out of practice so I'm over doing it and not taking care of myself.

Problem this time is, I actually have some (non-stolen) money and I am self-employed with all the freedom in the world so it has literally been day and night for the last week. 

I'd probably keep going on this way forever if it weren't for my family and friends who I can't stand to disappoint. They are just too good of people to fuck with like that. I also want to be awake just a little, this half-sedated all the time thing actually kinda sucks.

Anyway, who gives a shit, I have a couple questions I was hoping my fellow opiophiles would help me with so I can clean up and go back to playing with fire once and awhile rather than being burned alive. 

To provide context my ROA is smoking, it's Tar, I started by smoking a .2-.4 sack every day two weeks ago, I took three days off got through 80% of the WDs then since last Tuesday I have worked up to .4-.8 a day. I don't have access to subs/methadone. I do have 3 5/500 hydrocodones (as if that will help), klonopin, Xanax, ambien, kratom, loperamide, and anything else I need to get OTC.

Onto the questions:

1. How fucked am I with the WDs? I haven't gone this hard for years so I'm not sure how bad a full week will be. Back when I was constantly off and on using a week had me feeling pretty effin shitty. The first weeks withdrawals were fairly mild, I could actually sleep. But definitely achy, RLS, Chills, Yawning. This time around I've done a lot more and for 7 days straight morning and night rather than 5 here and there, and I didn't finish the WDs entirely.

2. How do you guys get through the morning/waking up without dosing? I wake up so damn depressed and foggy headed. Is there a trick to stopping this? Maybe not dosing before bed? Coffee and gym? I just start feeling so much shame it kills me. 

3. I'm smoking my last day tomorrow. Any tips for not being such a bust. I am a dead fucking giveaway every time, pacing, red eyes, being too nice/creepy guy on opes.

4. Any other tips. Exercises you guys picked up to help me build up motivation to push through these sissy WDs. Anything at all really that will help me say goodbye and clean up. Advanced withdrawal techniques? I've done this probably hundreds of times but I forgot how. How long will it take me to get back to normal? How hard should I push myself? Anyone have and good excuses for sucking/not wanting to go out/not performing my share at work? 

tldr: chipping got out of hand. Trying to not make my mom cry anymore. I'd love any input/words of encouragement. Thanks so much for any input.",1383123979.0

So I edited it out because it's still a pretty good read IMO...","in the town i live in a bag of ecp/sometimes bth for the last year(.04-.1 depending on your dealer, how that particular dealer feels that day, where they're at in their stash, etc etc...) runs 20 bucks. it's pretty fucking outrageous. i know that in any big city i can get grams for as low as 100 bucks. one such big city is about 150 miles away... how a 2 and a half hour drive has caused such a disconnect in prices, i don't know. i do know it sucks and after dealing with it for over 10 years and constant expectations of the price dropping to something more reasonable in the near future and it never happening, i decided to make some changes. here is the plan i formulated pretty much over the last few years that all finally came together in the last couple months:

stop buying local dope(or at least as much)

make more money! (get a second job and bust my ass)

meet someone in that big city with a good connect

save some money and ride to the city, buy a g, bring it back home and sell a few bags at the local price to cover the cost

???????

profit!

my girlfriend was skeptical that i could acquire that much dope and not do it all myself/not kill myself, etc. this of course gave me an opportunity to prove her wrong, which i love to do. also the other reasons. but proving her wrong was icing.

so yesterday(monday), i made my second trip to the city to meetup with my new buddy for the second time (the first time was sort of a test run.....) He's really cool and i wish we lived closer to each other.  I'd definitely hang with him on a regular basis.

Also, one of my buddies at one of my jobs needed to go to the italian embassy in the city to try and get his green card renewed. My italian buddy loves heroin (lots of pizza bakers love heroin/opiates i've noticed... maybe it's just cooks/restaurant employes... ?????) anyway i had mentioned to him my awesome hookup in the city and he asked me to come along on his trip so we could kill 4-7 birds with one stone. he gets his green card and a bunch of cheap dope; i get a free ride to the city and a bunch of cheap dope. There was also some really fine fish scale. MORE ICING!

So we go, we get drugs, we do drugs.*(further down is the story of us doing the drugs and Italian douchcanoe, i wanted to tell yall why i'm proud of myself first).

We come home and i have a gram of boy that i paid 120 bucks for. it really looked like more than a gram to me but who knows. i don't have scales. I also saved a little bit of the girl for my girlfriend (she loves that shit), and me...duh. she of course expects me to do it all within 2 or 3 days like last time.

BUUUUUUT we did all the coke, of course, you don't save coke....'

BUUUUUUT i totally sold six bags. 2 each to 3 guys for a total of 120 bucks. I broke off some for my buddy in the city and I have stayed high for 40 hours straight now (*it's been about 60 now as i'm reposting this, and i still got about .15 left.  i haven't pooped for real since last thursday so i'm going to wait til i poop and then kill that .15 in one shot probably by late tomorrow afternoon.  from there i'll be straight til i get paid friday. 
GO ME!). and I got a little less than a half g left with lots of pebbles in it. 

So i made my money back!!!! (except for the 30 i spent on the blow, but that's whateva).

This was all from my first real paycheck from both jobs and i blew all the money i had left after getting high as shit all weekend. Now i got a wallet full of cash, a kit full of dope, a fridge full of fancy beer, cheap beer, cheap bourbon, cheap peach vodka, and pizza rolls, i got plenty of cigarettes.

PAYDAY IS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW! WHAT! i'm so proud of myself guys. I have been living off 130-180 bucks a week for the last year. now it's 375-425. what what! i stepped up my pizza hustle and now i'm able to step up my h hustle. woop woop!

*SO HERE'S THE STORY ABOUT US GETTING HIGH IN THE CITY AND THE ITALIAN GUY I WORK WITH BEING A TOTAL PRICK AND OTHER THINGS.

(i know it's not really in order of the story but i wanted to tell yall about how proud of myself i am. I told my girlfriend after i sold the last two bags that got me to 120 and she didn't really seem to care or understand why it was so important to me....womp womp)

We pulled into a wendy's parking lot about 100 yards from the apartment complex where we copped. The italian(let's call him N) does a little too much yayo in his shot (i did a tester cuz i'm responsible! ha...) and he's all geeked and later ends up having to pull into a kroger parking lot to chill. My reddit buddy(let's call him O) and I get bored waiting on N to come down a little(i got him something to drink first and made sure he was ok). I decide that my little tester shot wasn't satisfactory at this point and i invited O to the bathroom in the grocery store to get down a little more on the speedball train. CHOO CHOO BITCHES!

Turns out N and I both being from this shitty small town with shitty coke and expensive boy, underestimated how strong this coke really was. After doing a pretty massive shot in the grocery store bathroom i had a very harrowing 75 foot walk out to the minivan. like, i could barely fucking walk y'all. looking back it's funny. honestly it was pretty funny to me at the time, too.

N was still geeked as fuck and he freaked the fuck out when he saw how fucked up i was. I couldn't really talk.... or see... or hear... or walk... i was having some tremors and i know i must have looked like i was dying. But i've been there before and i knew i was going to be fine in 15 minutes. I've been that high on IV coke plenty of times but it's usually been somewhere i can lay down and just ride it out. not in grocery store parking lots with a geeked italian yelling about taking me to the hospital and freaking out at O for leaving me in the bathroom ""where i could have died"". I had told O in the bathroom that i was fine and that i'd meet him in the car about a minute after i did my shot. i was not aware that i was still coming up and there was a lot of coming up to do.

anywho i convinced N that I was going to be ok and within 10-20 minutes i was. He was still really high strung and had a green card appt to be at soon. He ended up dropping O off on the side of the road like a mile and a half from his house because he was in such a hurry. That shit pissed me off a whole lot. O got us hooked the fuck up and you're going to just drop him on the side of the fucking road dude? that's dirty shit. 

I lost a lot of respect for my coworker (notice i referred to him as my buddy from work earlier, now he's just ""coworker""? that's how much respect i lost. fucking prick)

So before we even left the town for the city, I had N agree with me that we would both break a decent sized chunk out of our grams for O as a finder's fee. He definitely deserved it even though his dealer hooked him up with some for bringing him so much money. i gave him a good bump of coke when we did our testers and in the grocery store bathroom i gave him a decent chunk of boy and a pretty fatass chunk of girl. I feel like I did my part. I asked to make sure and O seemed happy with what i gave him. After N so rudely dropped O off on the side of the road I asked him if he had broken O off a piece like we had agreed. ""NO, THAT FUCKER DIDN'T DESERVE IT! HE LEFT YOU IN THE BATHROOM TO DIE! THAT'S WHY I LEFT HIM ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD!""

what the fucking fuck, dude? I spent two hours sitting in your minivan listening to shitty euro-techno so i could get you a FUCKING SPECTACULAR HOOKUP! and this is how you repay me and my friend? I was so fucking embarassed. I can't believe how greedy some people are. It was all obviously a shitty excuse for him to not have to come off any of his boy.

Later he texts me telling me that his wife had a severe allergic reaction to the detergent in my clothes when she got in the van and that we couldn't make any more trips to the city. boo fucking hoo. like i want to deal/hang out with/do favors for your embarassing eurotrash ass ever again. go make a pizza or something asshat.

rant over.

I've been around these parts a bit lately because I got curious, and I have a question that I haven't seen answered or asked yet.

Oh, and first, a disclaimer, I do not plan to use any opiates recreationally, so the warnings and such are not necessary, but if you'd like to go ahead :p

On to the question; A theme that seems to pop up here pretty frequently is that opiates are ""the best of times, and the worst of times"", and that it'll sort of take you to the highest of highs, than throw you to the lowest of lows. Also, this is the only drug subreddit I've seen where the users genuinely warn people not to do what they're about to do regularly.
So, what I want to know is, for you personally, has your flirt with opiates been worth it? Are the highs worth the lows? Would you do it again? Also, if you're comfortable saying which ones you've done that'd  be nice too.

Ok, so I need some input on people who are 100% sure have had street Fent (or analogue) bags before.

Basically long story short I have been on subs for about 8 months this go around and have been pretty damn good about it. I decided I wanted to get high soooo I hit up my old dope dealer that I had his number saved. His dope was ALWAYS the same, brown rocks that cooked down and left a little bit of shitty residue on the spoon. There are fellow redditors that have tried it out and loved it, so I guess it was pretty decent. Well 2 days ago I copped a gram and a half for a RIDICULOUS price, and unfortunately it was my only option at the time so I went for it. He claimed it was China White (he's  super hood ass dude, wasn't gonna argue with him. Don't wanna get shot).

I got home and checked the shit out. It looked kinda like a cheese with a hard outer shell that was kind of yellowish? but the inside was an almost off white.. if you want a visualization check this link.. sorry best I can do as I am high as shit right now.. https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTLqBo3n0JbvRsF9NyE2qcJd-TwBJy9KIQelRx8RNQh75f_NI9jw 

So anyway this dope is incredibly strong, Does not need heat, is white in color and mixes into a clear golden solution. It takes maybe 30 seconds of stirring little chunks to break it all down, and it leaves ZERO residue in the spoon. I dud a test shot and was rocked soooo hard, I fell asleep sitting up. From a test shot!!! The weird thing is though is that I get pins and needles in my forehead and top of my head and my hands and feet, and literally fall asleep every time I do a shot right away, and always wake up without even putting away all my shit. WTFF??

Sorry for the wall of text guys, but I was curious if anyone has had experience say getting the stamp bags of fent that kill ppl where they have stamps like in Pittsburgh or NY. This shit doesn't burn my nose when I snorted a little bit like I remember dope does, but it has also been 8 months since I last did H.

**Tl, DR:** White dope that doesnt require heat mixes cleanly into solution a golden color. Shit gives me pins and needles throughout my whole body, starting in my hands and feel and forehead and top of my head. Shit knocks me out for a half hour - 45 mins every time, even if I do a baby shot and don't ever have time to put gear away. Did I just get Fent?? Who for sure has had it before, and what was it like??

I am not posting to Reddit first thing after almost dying. END NOTE **


About 7 or so hours ago my wife and I were sitting in the car after driving two hours out to pick up our two grams of H. I got out my kit and put only about .2 or so in my dose. (I usually do .5 or more easy, his stuff is pretty meager.)

At first I felt fine, got a nice rush off of it really. I remember saying this to my wife and then that is the last thing I remember. This next part is written by my wife since I have no recollection of the experience pre-ambulance.

""I looked over at him wondering why he was being so quiet and hadn't made up my dose yet. He was sitting in the drivers seat and I the passengers. I asked him if he was ok, and I got no reply. This is when I notice his lips and face are blue and there's a long string of drool hanging from the corner of his mouth. It didn't even register what I was seeing for a second, he'd only done the tiniest amount and everyone else whom had the same stuff and similar tolerances all did .5-.7... 

I didn't stay frozen long though. After slapping the shit out of his face, I immediately went into adrenaline panic mode when I didn't get any response and realized he definitely wasn't breathing. I checked his pulse, and ran out to get help (neither of us had working cell phones.) A fairly large group came back with me and another woman and I pulled my husband out of the car, not an easy feat since the man is 6'5"" @ 165lbs. Accidentally split his head a bit on the back, nothing serious. I commenced along with the help of this woman in giving him CPR until paramedics arrived. The woman ended up being a Corpsmen for the Army. Multiple times she checked his pulse and breathing and even though he regained some color he still wasn't breathing on his own and at one point she lost his pulse... scariest moment in my life. Once the paramedics arrived he opened his eyes briefly and then closed them again. They set up their equipment, and right before they were about to bag him he sat up wild eyed looking confused and completely awake. It was so strange. 

They put him on a stretcher and sent him off anyways just because they almost had to resuscitate him. We got a bit of applause and a commendation from the paramedics for the CPR. I was just so fucking thankful his was alert and seemingly ok with medical staff around him now I almost collapsed in tears..""

That was her account. She really is the best wife in the world and I owe her my life I believe with all my heart. We both wish we got the other lady's name as well to send her a token of our appreciation...

Anyways, in the ambulance they just gave me an IV. After this I got to the E.R. and had my vitals taken/monitored. I got a chest x-ray and some blood work done. I was very awake and coherent at this point but the nurse administered some Nalcon...? Narcon...? Something to kick the dope and up my respiratory rate. I felt like shit after this for a good 10 minutes and that's... well that's it. Discharged myself after a few hours of nothingness and feeling perfectly fine.


So anyways, now to my question. They put the incident down as an overdose. However, it just didn't feel like a correct diagnosis. I hardly did any and I have a super high tolerance. I don't think it was the cut either because everyone had the same exact stuff and everyone else was fine and dandy. Also the fact that I woke up so quickly out of nowhere and once awake (with no medical assistance other than my wife's CPR) I was completely coherent and felt fine...albeit confused as fuck.

I'm wondering if maybe it was a blood clot that dislodged or some kind of embolism? I'm not exactly sure on the details of either's impact in your lungs but I know they can inhibit your breathing. If not I'd like to hear anyone else's possible ideas on the issue? If it might be anything other than the dope I'd like to hear your opinions so I might be able to get it checked out since the E.R. really didn't believe me with how much I said I did so they just stuck with OD without any further tests really. 

Sorry for this being so long btw guys! I do really appreciate any and all comments on this. Overall I'm just happy to be alive and it really was a rather large and scary wakeup call that something can always happen. So be safe and always try to have a buddy to watch over you!! Personally I think our opiate days are coming to an end soon...

TLDR; O'Ded according to Doctor on a dub of dope with a HUGE tolerance and friends doing way more of the same stuff. (Stopped breathing only, was given CPR and revitalized through that by my wife.) Wanting opinions if it maybe could have been anything else I might want to have checked out more thoroughly!

I never take more than 30-45 mg adderall throughout a given day and have never IVed any drug. Adderall is usually administered orally with the rare snort/plug to shorten duration or stretch out my supply. I only snort heroin or suboxone, but rarely oxycodone snorted or hydrocodone orally. I have a tolerance so dosages would do no good, but I VERY RARELY get high enough to nod out as I find getting this high very hard for me to do. I don't try to get crazy fucked up, just a nice euphoria to complement the adderall and limit side effects such as anxiety which I get unbearably from amphetamines.

Would a vasodilator help combat this? Like a simple nitrate? I have a few preworkouts that contain some nitrates. I'm asking because I'm under the impression that drugs like viagra are vasodilators? Or am I way off base there?

Low-level Hydro use leading to impending liver explosion?,"Standard disclaimer, throw-away, yada yada.  I AM SO SORRY FOR THIS WALL OF TEXT.  Looking for a bit of advice from the pros.  

I have a nice, free, steady supply of hydrocodone 7.5/750s and have been using the stuff regularly for maybe 1.5 years now.  Started out a few times a month, then every weekend, now daily.  I have a schedule for this shit.  A single 7.5/750 per night, Sun thru Thurs.  1.5 pills on Friday night.  2.5 pills on Saturday night.  I don't take them more than once a day.  

So, average week:  9 pills total, spread out through a week.  I don't exceed recommended daily APAP dosage ever.  I don't drink alcohol at all, ever.  No history of liver problems.  

For a little over a week, I've been having pain:  dull, burning ache, based on the right side, just under my rib cage/about belly-button level.  When I'm sitting down/leaning forward, it feels like something's enlarged/pushing against my ribs, and I'll get a ""pinching"" sensation, sometimes accompanied with a little nerve ""zing"" that travels around my torso.  The pain's been traveling a bit, to the middle of my belly, and I've had some stabs in my LEFT ribs today, but it definitely originates on the right.  

I went to the doc last Thursday.  The pain started more in my right flank, so at the time, I was thinking a kidney issue.  Urinalysis checked out okay.  Doc felt my abdomen, felt normal, nothing enlarged.  Told me it was probably muscular.  Got a flu shot, went home.  Spent a day sick from the damn flu shot.  Over the weekend, the pain took up residence in its current spot in my side, and has been pretty much constant ever since.  It's not ""oh God I'm dying right now"" - I'd give it anywhere from a 3 to a 5 on the pain scale - but it is not going away.  No other symptoms.  

Here's the thing.  Long story short, I'm an adult in a financial squeeze (unrelated to the hydro use) who is stuck living with my parents.  Parents are both medical professionals who have working relationships and doc/patient relationships with my doctor's office.  They are also MASSIVELY anti-Rx abuse.  If they find out that I'm using, I'm on the street.  

I guess my first question (and this is more for maybe a little peace of mind for me) is:  is it even feasible to have a liver implosion from this type of low-level usage?  Even on ""big nights,"" I'm well under the recommended max for APAP.  Has anyone else ever experienced this?  

More importantly, I'm getting to the point where this is obviously not going away, and I need to go back to the doctor.  I really, really want to be able to do this without them finding out I'm using, if at all possible.  Assuming that I play dumb and I'm straight about my symptoms without mentioning the suspected cause, what are the odds that they'll insist on a tox screen?  I mean, I can say that I take a lot of tylenol for my chronic foot pain (I have stomach problems/GERD, so Ibuprofen isn't really an OTC option for me without vicious acid reflux/nausea), but will they immediately do a tox screen if I say that, or will they just look at liver values?  

I'm probably doomed to failure, but I'm trying to balance being responsible and going back to the doc, with doing so in such a way that I can keep the doc in the dark.  I don't want to end up on a drug-seeker list - I have never sought extra meds, and don't plan to, and I want my options kept open if I legitimately need them.  I also don't want to risk someone ""letting something slip"" to my parents.  Let's face it, while cluing them in to my usage would be a HIPA violation for sure, it's not like I'm going to be able to sue the doc when I'm busy looking for a cardboard box to take up residence in.    

And if I'm being honest, I just want this shit fixed so I can go back to my comfortable, steady, amateur nightly nods.  I'm hooked enough at this point that even as freaked out as I am, it's not freaked out enough to just take a few days off the shit unless I know for 100% sure that it'll make a difference.  I'd happily do CWEs, but my living situation makes that impossible.  

**TL;DR:  Daily hydro use at ""safe"" doses, but having suspicious pain that could be liver-related.  How do I deal with doc without them finding out I'm using?  Is it even possible?**

**EDIT:**  Thanks for all the advice/suggestions.  It doesn't sound like they're likely to immediately sound the ""User"" alarm, which is comforting, and as some pointed out, I can just say I've been taking a lot of tylenol, or that I just recently got a few random hydro pills from a friend (which wouldn't be a lie!).  I won't even bring it up unless they ask.  That said, gallbladder (as suggested by /u/DoubleAcesHigh) actually sounds very much a possibility (in really thinking about it, I've had some other symptoms of that as well).  In any case, it's not letting off, and I don't want to wait through the weekend, so I have an appointment in about 90 mins.  I'll update so any *other* easily-panicked schmucks who come thru here can learn from my experiences.  ;)  

**FINAL EDIT:**  Yup, it's my gallbladder.  Surgery is in my future, which is not exactly fun... but it's fixable and not the end of the world, and not caused by APAP.  Thanks y'all.  I'm gonna go enjoy my safe and sound little nod now.  ;)

The amount in the bags is always tiny and my dude always wants straight dollar unless i get a bun, but the quality is really worth it. Anyway my question is when i switch back to subs ive sent myself into precipatated wd several times when ive waited my normal 18-20 hours. Now i have had dope this good(maybe better) in
 the past but nothing that holds this long. Is it cut with another longer acting opiate? I know fent is a somewhat common cut, but isnt that even shorter acting than h? I was thinking maybe morphine, but i only sniff these and the BA for that is pretty low with insuffalation i think. Is it just some actual h holds longer than others? I generally have to wait atleast 30+ hours before i can switch back to sub comfortably. Also it smells like h, but also has a very distinct smell and a very euphoric feel that lasts about as long as other h. Thoughts?

He was in the ICU for a few days and they have confirmed that he is now blind for the rest of his life. The man is 35 and to be fair he was a huge asshole. I honestly can't think of anyone else I would rather this happen to based on the horrible shit he has done. Despite that, I still feel bad and I would not actually wish it upon someone. The story I was told seemed to lack lots of details and I could not connect how just smoking bad dope turned to blood clots. I'm assuming it was a slow process from his repeated drug use for almost 20 years. I don't really have a lesson or anything here. I guess just be careful and know how important harm reduction is. Using a dirty needle or doing something else that is not optimal may not hurt you, but over the years it might add up. Be safe guys! :)

Ended up finding some extra cash, but my guy wasn't picking up his phone which means he is ""closed"" for the night. Fuck...

A friend had another hook up, which was closer but they aren't as big and the quality is just not quite as good. Still good stuff, but for the money I had I wouldn't really even get a nod.

Figured what the hell and tried my guy once more, and he answered. For the cash we had he decided to open up shop again. 

I'm not stupid so I don't bring any equipment with me, so I have to wait the hour or so til I get home. Finally get home and debated on if I should do my usual one bag or have a great time and do one and a half. Decide on just doing one and saving the rest for tomorrow at work.

Holy shit was I glad I did. Ended up being a new batch and this stuff was AMAZING. My guys stuff is always quality goods, but this ended up being better than usual.

I brought an old friend who is pretty new to dope along for the ride because he wanted to pick something up as well. Normally we get 1 extra depending on the cash but we came up with the money for a full jab, so I ended up with 1 more than what I paid for. He ended up tossing my driver an extra and also some gas money. Gotta love those ""new"" dope fiends and their expendable income, right?!

I ended up VERY happy, driver ended up VERY happy, and my friend was VERY happy because he is used to getting charged double and getting his shit stepped on.

For me personally I enjoy doing things while I'm on opiates.  If I just wanted to be passed out or barely conscious I'd take some ambien or a high dose or benzos/benadryl. I don't necessarily hate the feeling, but I find it to be a waste of my time.  If I'm nodding I usually see that as taking too much and I try to stay just under the dosage that would bring me to a nod.  So I'm as euphoric as possible while also being awake and able to enjoy it and do fun things/socialize/etc.

Of course its also a fine line between a heavy nod and an OD and when you're nodding you're in a pretty impaired state of mind.  It gets easy to take too much and think you're just tired and then wake up puking at the hospital.  **It scares the hell out of me seeing people saying they want to mix opiates with benzos to enhance the nod.**  

Also, I'm getting spammed with people asking where to get Poppy Pods.  Internet searches are your friend , but vendors are in and out of business so frequently I can't tell you one specific place (even if it wasn't against the rules).

I'm not wasting my time. Why are you?!"" ... Just got back from the hospital. Wtf. I'm pissed.","Literal quote from the asshole on the street. 

So, going about my day with errands and such. I was somewhat lost so I was driving slowly to make sure I don't miss the address. I decided fuck it I'm going to pull over and use my maps (I had it on earlier but my phone slid away so it was out of reach. I figure I knew the general direction). As I turned to find a safe spot to park and redirect myself I noticed some kid just acting ""off?"" Mind you there was a shit ton of pple just walking back and forth and no one paid any attention. I thought maybe the kids on some drugs and well just high but for some reason it just bugged me. I got out of my car to ask if he's ok. He looked my way but he wasn't looking at me. It was odd. Then boom. He fell and i noticed he was pale. Lips kind of started turning blue. I checked his pulse and holy crap it was faint. He was slurring something. Mind you guys through all the years I've used in the past I've never dealt with an OD but this was my first assumption that the kid was OD-ing. I looked at all the place quickly where someone can IV... Of course the crook of the arm first etc and yeup track marks. 

So by now adrenaline was pumping and I yelled for someone to call 911. I was debating if I should just hop him into my car and take him myself or if it was quicker for the ambulance to arrive. My phone was in my car and seeing so many pple walking I at least thought someone would damn call 911. That was when some asshole made that remark... *""He's a junkie. Who gives a fuck. I'm not wasting my time. Why are you?!""* WTF. So I said, ""BECAUSE HE'S A FUCKING HUMAN BEING ASSHOLE. I HOPE WHEN SHIT HAPPENS TO YOU SOMEONE SAYS WHO GIVES A FUCK. YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE!"" Yea he proceeded to kind of blab on about shit and I just said ""dude go on your merry way. You're just wasting your breath."" Fuck I was so pissed by now. 

Well I ran to my car quickly called 911 because I was hoping that the operator can tell me what I should do. Honestly I felt so fucking stupid bc I didn't know if I should just drive him to the hospital or wait for the ambulance. I mean if I waited how long would it take? But they have narcon(sp?) so that will help but if I take him could it be quicker? Etc. well I was told to stay put and the operator guided me to keep him awake and such-checked mouth to make sure nothing blocking airways, putting him in some crazy recovery position, etc.   I put the operator on speaker and kept talking to the dude to keep him awake .... Or conscious I guess. I don't know CPR so i was scared shitless if he decided to stop breathing (of course he didn't decide to stop breathing just a phrase I'm using right now). Me being me even tried to make a small joke (I know it's not a funny situation but I wanted to see him make some sort of response back) saying ""hey man. Please don't stop breathing and stay with me bc I'm a dumbass that doesn't know CPR and if you stop I'm probably going to shit in my pants... Literally and it won't be pretty for both you and I! And I'm wearing a skirt so I don't plan to shit in front of pple and a good looking guy like you."" Pretty much whatever I can think of to keep him conscious. By now pple were gathering. And I can hear the ambulance coming from a distance. 

I told him to just keep on holding on. The ambulance is almost here. I did not spend all this time for someone to give up on me now! I told the operator they were there and we got off the phone. The ambulance dudes came and took over. Injected him. Holy crap did he jolt and didn't look too happy.  I told one of them a brief of what happened. 

I didn't want to leave the kid alone so I drove to the hospital separately. I went inside and told the front nurse who I was. She couldn't tell me anything obviously and he just got there for observation and stuff...but she said she can at least let me know if he was alright. So I waited. I went to the lounge... I went outside... I went on reddit but just too much in shock to post then... Even now. I think I finally sat down and I started to cry. It just flowed out and I think I was overwhelmed. I was just mad about the guy, felt bad for the kid, felt stupid for not knowing what to do quick enough, but I couldn't stay sitting so I got up and asked if there was some news. She didn't have any so I wrote a note and I handed it to her to give to the kid. Just a sorry I wasn't there to make sure everything was ok. That I was glad that he stayed conscious with me long enough for help to arrive and I didn't have to shit in my skirt bc I didn't know CPR. I didn't sign my name or anything and kept it anonymous but fuck my hearts still pumping and I still can't believe this day actually happened. I feel terrible I didn't get to see the kid. 

Sorry for the wall of text or any errors. I'm posting from my phone and my minds everywhere right now. 

Tl;Dr: well according to the asshole junkies aren't human. Helped someone in need and almost shat in my skirt. 

Edit: missed a sentence

Edit 02: good morning all! I just woke up to amazing beautiful messages! Ty for all the wonderful comments! And  it's something humans should be doing in the first place for each other... Helping each other! Well that is what I was taught growing up... Help others no matter who they are. I told my parents what happened and my mom started crying. She was thinking what if that could be me (they don't know about my addiction to opiates in the past but they thought I was addicted to coke, xannies, and herb) and no one was there to help me. Man that scared me and I just thought about the kid and I hope he gets in touch with his loved ones... Btw he looked early to mid twenties so he was obviously young. 

And a special thank you for the anonymous gold! I honestly didn't expect so much from this little rant of mine with gold nonetheless! 

I love this sub and I love the people here. As i told another redditor here, i just did what anyone else from this community would have done.

If anyone has any info on that I'd like to read it.

From what I've read and heard about people in less modern times in opium dens/etc they would take iron supplements to replenish themselves and it supposedly helped reduce negative long term effects.

Loss of iron can be associated with all sorts of problems but a big one is anemia.  I never really had problems with anemia before using and now if I don't take an iron supplement daily I get very anemic.  They actually thought I might have internal bleeding or something when I went to the doctor about it.  They found nothing other than a bunch of my vitamin levels were horribly low despite already taking a multivitamin and eating very well.

Other vitamins supposedly interfered with by opiates are potassium/magnesium and some others I can't remember.  Both potassium and magnesium are definitely two big ones that can really have big negative effects on your health if you aren't keeping the levels up properly.

Oh yeah, don't forget about that chinga baby, that 50 pound rock sitting in the pit of your stomach, bloating you until it's painful to lay down for extended periods, or move in general. This, that is, is of course followed by the inevitable runs, which will ALWAYS catch you off-guard, and is always accompanied by groans and yelps that to the unsuspecting ear must sound all but demonic.

Don't even get me started on that film that coats your throat, the dry flaky skin because all your oil glands are dried up, the irritability and intense yearning... And that thought we're all thinking, all the time...

I never moved into regular usage mainly because it's so hard to get a regular connect.  I've also had depression for pretty much ever (I'm 28).

I've googled it a lot and dabbled in subs and I'm beginning to seriously consider taking them strictly as an anti-depressant.  I've noticed there's a sweet spot somewhere around 2mg where I'm lifted enough to feel generally good without nodding.

Setting aside the difficulties of supply, I want to know what you all think.  I imagine at least some of us sought opiates initially to treat depression, and maybe some people who ultimately end up on subs would have saved a lot of time, money and bodily health had they simply started with the subs.

no one knew he was shooting, and it was probably a relapse. i mean you can make a million justifications why that won't happen to you, i know you can, we're good at doing justifications. he never thought that'd happen to him.  
  
so anyway i've been kicking around taking a break, cutting back anyway, and now i think i'm hanging it up. truth is you'll never get enough.  
  
i wasn't going to elaborate. who wants to hear a sad story? we always think, well it's a pretty victimless crime right? i mean it's me and my addiction. if i handle my shit, who are you to say anything? And he thought that too. until it was one of his best friend, who didn't know, found him. and the comfort his mom got in seeing that all his friends weren't strung out, but showed up in suits for the wake and funeral, she was comforted in something normal when life seemed so backwards. She was burying her 27 year old son, who she kicked out of her house but found comfort that he died with a roof over his head and not in some alley. I cleaned up the bathroom he was in, threw out  the three unsmoked cigarettes left in his pack. the half smoked joint he never finished. stripped the bed he slept in. he was pretty functional. it was probably a relapse wit ha decreased tolerance. it was only a bag and a half, i threw out a half filled one. i don't know what he did before those two but it didn't look like much.   
  
 and at first i was angry. because why man? what the fuck? i knew better. i've never od'ed. not once, in 7 years. and then i was sad because it doesn't matter. it's part of it. it's part of that life. and i know a lot of us are willing to live with that risk. but don't think that you'll hurt no one. the only solace they'll find is in saying that the pain is over. that you're at peace now from the addiction. you don't jsut put yourself at risk, you'll rock a whole big world that comes out to hug your mother and brother and sister and nephew and niece. and those kids you grew up with, that you don't see as much, they'll all be there too. and everyone will cry, no exceptions. people who quit will smoke. people will drink. people won't know what to do with themselves because they are burying some way too soon.

Anyways, anyways, last night he called me and said he was moving and was gonna need money for rent each month and asked if I was looking to buy because he needed cash. Normally that would sketch me out, but not with him. I said yeah dude this 8ter's been holding me off pretty well but I actually just ran out yesterday and I'm already starting to withdraw, and unfortunately I don't get paid till Friday, but I'll definitely be picking up then. He goes ohhh bro you're my people! drive on over here and I'm going to toss you half a g so you can fiend off your withdraw, I trust you'll pay me for it when you can. I picked up the half g and it's some fire. Did my second shot just 10 minutes ago nodding the fuck out while typing this, so happy. 

On a side note I'm getting 25 20mg oxy's today. It's no dope but fuck I love me some oxy.

TL;DR dealer was wondering where I was, asked me if I was wanting to buy because I'm probably his biggest customer, I tell him on Friday I will be buying but I;m in WD, he tosses me a half gram in the mean time. I have the best dealer, ever, period. ",1383737306.0

The only problem with that is, I really only have one place to go, and that's back to my parents, but if I do that, then I have to quit drugs, and that is the last thing I want to do right now. So basically, my options are get arrested, move back in with my parents for a while and quit all the drugs, or go homeless. Fuck me life sucks.

It took me about 2 months just be seen but when I went to my appointment he walks in and immediately says you need to stop taking norco.  he then berates me for about 20 mins about how much pain he has had for the last 30 years and he only takes about 4 percocet a month.  anyways i knew that i was fucked when he said he wanted me cut off since my regular doc that prescribes me the norcos looks up to this guy.  After that i have my app with her and she is like yep, you are done.  Most fucked up thing is she told me verbally more than once that when I got into this pain program that they would ""at least start me on some low dose oxycontin""  I cannot believe what dirty shit was pulled on me.

I've been thinking about healing. A lot, really. I'm hurting so much, and I've been lashing out at friends and family so much lately. I know I'm lucky, to be an almost 40 year old man who still has brothers and sisters, and a mother and father who care enough to help.... that's a pretty rare thing, I'd imagine. Hell, I know it is. Most of my friends waiting for me in the earth already didn't have so much help as me. That's probably why they're there already, and I'm not yet.

I don't know how to get better. I know how to get the dope out of my system, how best to weather the withdrawal. I mean hell, what junkie doesn't know this stuff? But I want to heal. I want to be a good father again, a better husband, son, and brother again. I want to repay all my debts. But I hardly feel human anymore, I don't relate anymore. I can't find the perspective I had when I walked out of prison 4 years ago, and the world was my oyster. I barely remember it, but I can't find it. I was connected to everything and everyone around me, I loved the world and I could feel it love me back through the grass under my feet. Now I just feel cold.

Everyone tells me I'm almost there. I remember I used to find peace in drawing and painting, but that seems lost to me. I used to be a classical guitarist, too, but I cut my fingers to the bone when I was high, and I can't feel them anymore. Bach, apparently, is lost to me. I can still sort of play, but not with the 25 years practiced grace I had just a year ago. I tell you, though, once in my past learning his cello prelude helped me heal.

I'm still human, I hear Daughter singing to me. I'm still human. Underneath my skin, buried deep within, despite everything... but I think I'm dying here. Woken up like an animal, I'm unready for healing. My mind is lost within my mind streaming, woken up kicking and screaming. Oh! Take me out of this place I'm in. Oh! Break me out of this shallow case I'm in.

I have a simple question. How much codeine is safe for me to take?

I was recently prescribed 120mL of Robitussin-AC which contains Guaifenesin, I don't know why the doc. decided to give me that instead of the regular. Honestly, I wasn't even that sick, just a slight cough. 

Anyways, each 5mL has 10mg of codeine and 100mg of Guaifenesin. I know Mucinex sells 1200mg of Guaifenesin pills over the counter, so I suppose it's not too toxic.

The past 2 weekends I have taken Hydrocodone. Only on Fridays and Saturdays. The first time I did 35mg on an empty stomach, vomited about 1.5 hrs later. Then 30mg the next day, no vomiting. 

The weekend afterwards I did 30mg with a cup of chocolate milk, vomited ~1.5-2hrs later. Next day I did 25mg and no vomit. Needless to say, I felt good every time, especially after vomiting and reducing the nausea. I guess I need to eat food to keep it down, but I don't want to lose the kick of taking it on an empty stomach. Tradeoffs, I guess. 

Now, the 4oz of codeine. I want to take 2oz = 120mg of codiene. Safe? I think so, but just want some reassurance. The Guaifenesin may make me puke, but I doubt it. As I said earlier, 1200mg is a standard OTC dose.

Should I take it all at once? I heard it accelerates the conversion of codeine into morphine, but I don't know how true that is. And 120mg seems like a lot to be taking all at once, considering my use.

I'll probably be sharing the other half bottle with a friend, because 'sharing is caring'. haha.

My boyfriend of 5 years and I are both users. We like about 20-40mg op and a few oxy 5s to blow. That's a good night. We have been slowly watching our tolerance get higher an higher. 

I live with him at his dads. I don't want to get too into things but his dad has a lady friend who doesn't live here. Last Wednesday she decide to scream at us about how we are scum bags and his father never wanted us to live here and he doesn't like me and pretty much anything she could say to hurt feelings. His father sat there not saying a word but just looked lost in thought. This whole time we thought we were helping him. We were only here because we thought he needed us. I had a panic attack and we have decided to move out regardless of how his father feels. Thursday, Halloween, I asked Mitch to marry me. I don't want to remember this time in my life as something we were forced into and I had been thinking about askin him for a while. So he is more motivated than ever. Things are looking good. 

We haven't done any pills since Friday. We have been trying to ignore the sniffles and sneeze and night sweats. I caved today. It's been almost a week which is longer than we have gone since I can remember. He just left to get us 2 oxy 30s. We are overpaying and I hate it but the people we trade pot for them are not in need yet. 

I'm not sure what I am trying to say. Day 5 was hard because I couldn't get the thoughts out of my head. I just wanna get high. I feel guilty because we are trying I save money but I should be thinking about the money we saved not doin any for 5 days!

The feeling reminds me of winter, McDonald's coffee drinks, constant hunger; the Bad Time, when any benzo I could get was a life raft to lights-out and escape to time-travel to another moment. Just please not this one. It was better than being awake to feel everything, and go through the same sickeningly tired arguments again.

It's been awhile. A friend gave me a Klonopin today. I told her I didn't have anything else today and was starting to feel anxious. She understood perfectly. 

In the Bad Time I would cry and throw fits over having to settle for symptom-management rather than a ""good time"". (Which never was). Now a handful of trams, Loperamide, Gabapentin, the odd amphetamine or random benzo is enough to almost leak tears of gratefulness sometimes. Fuck no, I'm not religious but I consider that a blessing.

I've never had the slightest clue what I'm running toward. I know what I'm running away from, but the bad memories were created in the service of running in the first place--from the empty hole. It's always coming. It's coming for me right now. It's a long war.

Maybe for the first time today I tried to answer the question about what I want. I don't want to be high. I've done terrible things just to get well. It's a rush like none other. It takes a while to congeal into bad memories later, like old gravy. 

The contentment when there's no more fear of the darkness coming. I can achieve that with so little now. Another blessing. If I'm still well from what I did another day, then I can have another good day. 

The only symptoms I fear anymore are crying and leg pain. I fear the fear the most. I'm afraid if something doesn't go to the right receptors there will be no relief from fear. I've been told for years to treat fear with depression meds or mood-stabilizers. They're afraid to give me anything else. Do I need Lamictal if I don't have mood swings and may not even have Bipolar? I'm happy now, my freedom was hard-won and it still tastes really sweet. I can wake up, look around and say, ""You're home now, it's over."" ",1383764256.0

Lope here. Long time lurker, first time poster...I never really had the sack to go and discuss this topic with my normal username, so what the hell! 

So, I have a question for you all. I have been taking Lope on a pretty regular basis (daily) for, probably about a month now.  I stay thoroughly hydrated, drinking an enormous amount of water/gatorade a day, and I DO have regular bowel movements (youre welcome!).  That being the case...what kind of negative effects could this be causing inside of me? I am working on coming off a pretty high dosage of oxys (200mg+/day), and have been using the Lope to stave off all the issues.

I'm 27/M.  Started using opiates in early high school.  Before football, we'd all munch on the green-speckled lortabs and yellow jacket speed pills.  After my first knee reconstruction, I was given the old OCs (20 mg).  ROCKED MY FRIGGIN' WORLD.  Coming off those was a bitch, eh?  

In college, there wasn't much pill talk outside of Adderall and the occasional Xanax bar if you knew the right people.  I occasionally could get Hydro cough syrup when the season came to catch a cough.  But that shit never lasts.  I feel like I was leanin' for a couple days then I was all out.  It didn't matter that much to me at the time, I was smoking a ton of weed and drinking more than anything else.  Drunks don't need drugs. 

After college, I came back to my town, and before long, was around some of the guys that had never left town.  I started making connections, and long story short, one day got turned onto Roxy 30's.  I was blown away.  Those guys were constantly around, and i could get 5 for a bill, so it was a good deal in my mind.  One day I scored a new thing I had never heard of, OPANA 40mg.  Stop signs baby.  I was still getting FLOORED if I was taking more than one 30 Roxy.  I did the whole 40mg stop sign.  That's a story too.  

Anywho, it's been about 5 years since then.  I'm IV free, never have I ever.  I'm usually not that turned on to the H game (too much of a risk around here - cut up/fake/cops, but every now and then, it's all thats around.  I am a 'functional user' I guess you could say.  I have never paid rent late, had an overdue bill, or even taken a credit hit (in the 700s!).  I've paid my 30k in student loans back already, and currently contribute a good % of my paycheck to a retirement fund.

Anywho, just felt the need to say hey and introduce myself!  See you guys on here!  Happy hunting!",1383878133.0

So I've used sense I was 13, first dose ever was a quarter of an 80 op. I did a quarter once a month, then once a week, then a few times throughout the week. Never felt addicted beyond the fact that I enjoyed it and it was free for about 5 years. At the end of that 5 year stint I started buying my own pills, perc 10's and 40mg would still get me pretty fucked up. 

I joined the army and stopped using for 6 months, had my first wd when I went into basic, but after that I simply forgot that the pills even existed. The night I came home from the army I did maybe 20mg of some really good and pure heroin. I wanted to and after I did it I said oh my god it's so much cheaper and better yadda  yadda. Anyways, it's been about 9 months from that point and 2 months ago a half gram would last me 3-4 days, but now that shit only lasts me a night. I stated shooting because I thought it would save me dope, and for the first week I was right, but then it went back to a night.

I bought a ball 3.1g's and thought I could ration that out for a week or two if I only did one or two shots a day, and maybe even took breaks. Well it lasted me 3 days... I felt terrible and realized I'm so fucked for the entire week. I contacted my dealer and got fronted a half gram and it's long gone, just did a dirty shot I collected by scrubbing my cookers and pushing down on my cotton. Luckily I got a buzz out of it and no cotton fever. Tomorrow at 8am I'm picking up a gram but I know that it's only going to last a few day and then I'll be screwed again for the entire week. 

What should I do? I'm not eligible for a methadone clinic or a suboxone program and I feel like I'm stuck... I never wanted to be addicted to this shit but I walked that road myself and I have no-one left to blame.

Will it keep for a couple days after being mixed?  
What about heating?  The dope is good enough I could get away with not heating but it's better to. 

2.  Use the contact lens case.   (Saw this idea on this sub a while back).  I balled up cotton pieces and put in one gel cap and the dope will go in the other and store in one side. ill mix on the other side. I won't be able to heat of course.

3.  Pre-mix and heat just a couple shots and use either storage method.  Best one?

4. Pre load a syringe and use a toothbrush case.  I've always fucked up and lost dope this way too many times.  Most likely won't do this.

Whenever I dose up before going to work, I work much harder, faster, more efficient, and I am generally in a happy mood while doing so. I work at a local pizza joint where I do everything from taking orders to making pizzas to washing dishes. It's a fairly physically demanding job. I have a variety of opiates that I've been able to try out while working and I'd like to give a ranking.

1. oxy/hydrocodone - lots of euphoric energy. lasts most of a 6 hour shift. probably a favorite.

2. dihydrocodeine - relative to codeine but stronger. lots of energy, comparative to oxy, but lacking in the euphoria. similar in duration to oxy, but it'll wear off after a few hours so it's shorter.

3. poppy seed tea (good unwashed seeds) - nice energetic effect from the combination of codeine, morphine, thebaine, and papaverine. Not quite as euphoric as oxy but moreso than dihydrocodeine. Duration is longer than oxy or dihydro and lasts till the end of a long shift.

4. heroin (nasal - fire afghan #4)- poor energizer, lacks the euphoria found in oxy and compares to poppy seed tea in that regard. Short duration requiring redosing.

So, I have a few questions concerning using the cola method to defeat Oxycontin OP's. I'll explain the method I currently use and then ask the question. So, I prep the little bastards by turning them into a fine powder using a pedegg. This is by far the best method I have come across. It turns the OP's into a nice, finely ground powder, and the shell of the device catches all of the powder for you. I'll take pictures and post them after I prep my 80mgs tonight (The thought alone is making my mouth salivate and my palms sweat...Pavlov..Fuck. I'm a slave. A conditioned slave. And I hate it. And I like it. Fuck.) Now, the benefit of having it in such a fine, powdery form is that you are maximizing the amount of surface area of Oxy that is surrounded by Cola at one time, thus allowing it to dissolve much more quickly, I think. So here is my question: IF you grind up an OP into a fine powder and then let it dissolve in Cola, will the time release be defeated more quickly? I have a potential hypothesis and a few questions:
Some people tend to think that it takes just as long to dissolve in the Cola as it would in your stomach since the pill is engineered to be released over an 8 hour or some time period. While I can see the logic in this, I can also see how the hypothesis could be incorrect for the following reasons: Firstly, by increasing the surface area of the pill that is in contact with acid, it seems to me that the time release would have an opportunity to dissolve all of it much more quickly (like, if it is in your stomach it can only dissolve the outer portion of the pill, then slowly dissolve more and more as it gets closer to the center of the pill while it eats away at the outer surface. However, if you crush it up, it dissolves all of it at once). Secondly, is the pH of cola the same as the pH of stomach acid? If not, wouldn't that have some sort of impact on how quickly the time release is defeated? 
Secondly, using this method, the powder is completely dissolved and the Cola turns into a sludgy substance within an hour. The fact that the powder has completely dissolved indicates to me that some sort of a chemical changed has happened. Is it safe to assume that the time release has been defeated once the powder is completely dissolved? It seems to me that it would be. However, I could also potentially see how even if the powder has completely dissolved, the pill still somehow takes approximately 8 hours to defeat the time release because of how the pill was engineered. 

If anyone has chemistry knowledge and can definitively give an answer/explanation, that would be extremely appreciated! To clarify, the question is: If you turn Oxycontin OP's into a finely ground powder, how long will that powder have to sit in Cola before the time release has been completely defeated?

If none of you have the chemistry background to give a definitive, scientific  answer to the question, then what sort of anecdotal experience do each of you have using the Cola method?  

TLDR-I want to talk about the best way to use the Cola method to defeat the time release on Oxycontin OP's

I travel alot and hve to go away for work pretty often so after some experimenting I have come up with some good techniques

When I am using I have an approx 8 bag a day IV habit..
So here it goes. A couple things you will need
at least 1 8mg sub, 300+ loperimide pills, a bunch of 5 hour energys.

A small disclaimer.. you may have to adjust the amounts that I will give you based on your habit.

Here it goes.
8 hours after last use take 50mg lope. 8 hours later, another 50mg lope.
16-24 hours after last use take 4mg sub.(be careful here and know your body so you dont take to early and put yourself into precitpitaded withdrawls)
12 hours after you first take sub take another 50mg lope.
24 hours after first sub dose take 2mg sub
24 hours later take 1mg sub
24 hours later take last 1mg sub
(use lope inbetween all sub doses amount depends on how much gets rid of any stray WD's you feel.
After your sub is all gone use a lope taper of the next few days.
As far as the 5 hour energys go they are great because they are loaded with Niacin which in clinical trials when taken at high doses has proven to give relief from both opiate and alchol WD.
It also has a shit ton of B12 which will help to detox.
Also drink plenty of water the whole time and get out and move around a bit.
ANyway this works perfectly for me. i literally will have no physical WD symptoms.. The mental WD on the other hand is something we will all always have to suffer through..

I hope this helps some of you. any questions hit me up!

Sorry for the novel, just had to post this since I'm feeling pretty proud of myself on 5 days reduced dosage.

[Chill Pills](http://i.imgur.com/wXm38RB)

Years ago I heard a personal finance show on the radio and they spoke about creative ways to combat poor financial habits.

One of the habits had to do with controlling impulse spending.  The program recommended putting your credit cards in a ziplock bag or small container and freezing it.  That way you can't just pull one (or more) out of your wallet and buy that $1500 pair of vintage honey badger fur ass-less chaps you think you absolutely need.  You at least have to go home and unfreeze your cards which, in theory, gives you at least a few minutes at minimum to really consider how bad you really need them.

So I took that lesson and applied it to my pills (OxyIR 20mg K57s).  I'm trying to step down from being on them several times per day as maintenance med to just a breakthrough pain relief solution and then hopefully wean off completely.  I put the bottle, along with the pills inside of course, into a snack size ziplock bag, which went into a quart sized ziplock filled with water.

With this method I have to do exactly what I wrote above, and decide if 1.) I am really in enough pain to waste my time letting it melt (even putting the bag in a pot of hot water takes a some amount of time) is really more important than doing something productive or enjoyable such as helping build houses for Habitat for Humanity or surfing.

So far so good.  It's been five days since I put them in the freezer and one of the good side effects is that I don't have those familiar feelings of desperation and angst I get when I run out before I'm supposed to because I know that, should the pain get truly unbearable or the day has really been so shitty I need to get noddy, I'm not in a position that I have to suffer without relief or risk doing something stupid or dangerous (stealing money, doctor shopping, street buys, etc.) because of said desperation.

Anyway, the wife is fed up with me being on the pills to point she is just about ready to take the kids and divorce me.  So at this point, despite me being in legitimate pain (and totally addicted) the addiction and euphoria hasn't clouded my mind enough to the point that I'm willing to risk that nightmare.  So this seems like a decent intermediate step towards cutting down or quitting but in a way that won't turn me into an agro spewing asshole. And the rest of my family desperately want me off the meds and they thought this was a really good idea as a first step so I thought I'd share with you all.  Good luck and stay safe folks.",1384072108.0

If nothing else, maybe we can use this as a reminder to always be safe, and always try to have narcan on hand, as I did not and very well could have died as a result.

My buddy and I got out of work and went to pick up from one of our usual dudes who consistently has decent stuff. I loaded up 4 bags in my rig, which is pretty normal to me, I've even done 5-6 bag shots of stuff with the same stamp, but when I prepped this shot it just looked darker than usual. I figured it must be a little better than usual, but of course in my junky mind, I was just that much more excited for the shot.

First thing I noticed was the rush was fucking intense. Like, pins and needles all over, and heavily blurred vision. I remember telling my buddy I wasn't too sure about this, and we were joking around about overdosing. I don't remember anything from the next 5 or so minutes. He said I went unconscious, was drooling, and was taking like one really labored breath every like 20 or 30 seconds with no breathing in between. He told me he was shaking/smacking me violently and screaming at me and I finally came back and started talking total nonsense; words, but no complete thoughts or sentences.. just... a jumbled mess of sounds.

All I remember is looking for something (don't remember what) a few minutes later. I wouldn't have known any of this if he didn't tell me, and I wouldn't have even really believed him if I didn't notice that some time had gone by unaccounted for. All I could think about was that another friend of mine who thinks I've cleaned up had loaned me $20 earlier, and how bad he would feel if I ODed right after him giving me that money. And about how upset I would have made my family, and everyone around me.

So... now that I've told my story, does anyone know how one can come into narcan without having it mailed? I'm currently living back with my parents again who would get awfully suspicious of a package that showed up in the mail, so I really don't think that's an option. Until I can get some, however, I know now to be much more careful with my dosing and to never use alone - who knows if I would have come back if my friend didn't smack the shit out of me?

There are a gazillion tutorials out there, but there are still a few points I'm unclear on.

Some sources say that hot water is fine, just make sure you don't use boiling water, since that will destroy the codeine. Other sources say to make sure the water is just lukewarm, not hot.

- during the cooling stage, how cold is too cold?

Apparently it's important not to let the liquid freeze. Does freezing destroy the codeine, or is there another reason for not letting it freeze? If when I check there's even a few ice crystals forming am I already screwed?

And finally, given that the filtration at the end can take a while, isn't there a risk that the temperature will rise high enough that the APAP will dissolve again?

I have heard people say that subs might be a bit too much for my habit but i really don't know what to do as I will soon be out of norcos with no script anymore.  both of my parents and a lot of my family have died from drugs so the addiction and craving is pretty instilled in me.  thinking subs might help with that.  thoughts?!?!  thanks!!,1384027515.0

I wish I had paid more attention to what was going on in your head. I wish I hadn't been stuck in my own little world. I'm sorry I wasn't the big sister that I could have been. It hurts me to know that we were suffering from the same pain & didn't share it. 

I know exactly how you felt, hiding behind a mask pretending everything is fine. Yet on the inside you wish people would care enough to *notice* the pain your hiding inside. You helped me a lot more than you ever knew. **I owe my life to you**, you took care of even when you were too young to even know it. I know I would have killed myself if not for you, & not just because I was responsible for you.  

I always thought this was a stupid thing to say but, you were an old soul.  *There's no other way an eight year old could soothe a suicidal teenager.*  I wish I had told you how much you helped me, it made me feel useless.  I was the one who was the big sister.  I was the one I was the one that raised you, I was the one who was supposed to be taking care of you.  Yet you did more for me than I ever did for you.  I just taught you all my shitty coping skills, while thinking I could protect you from all the pain I felt.  **Too fucking selfish to see that you felt all the same pain.**

I wish I had been there for you when it really mattered.  We were addicts & I know that we both knew it but didnt want to have to face it because then we would have to stop doing it.  It pains me that we suffered so close to each other yet so fucking far apart.  

I know why you didn't reach out, the same reason I didn't, the only way we knew how to cope was drugs.  It terrified me to think that if I told someone I'd lose the only thing that ever made me feel semi normal.  

I'm sorry I didn't notice your pain.  It wasn't because I didn't care, I was in my own world for so long.  I was a shell of a person.  There was so much that I didn't notice.  I'm so sorry that you had to learn the hard way & didn't get a second chance.  I guess you learned from the best, you were able to fool the teacher.  I thought I had control over your addiction & how much you were using.  **Which is fucking hilarious considering how little control I had over myself.**

**I hope you are just dead & can't see what a fuck up I still am.**  I *know* you wouldn't judge me but I know you'd be annoyed that I keep pushing my luck & throwing away my second, third, fourth chances.

The first time it happened it came back positive as morphine and I chalked it up to a tray of poppy seed muffins I had eaten. But this time, I cannot think of anything that would cause a positive. They just told me this morning and I told them to send it back for confirmation so I am waiting on the results. I don't know if it's something I'm doing causing false results or if it's something on there end like getting my piss mixed up or anything like that.  

Does anybody have any ideas as to what could be happening? I'm a 26 year old female if that helps. 


EDIT: Let me make this clear that these are the required drug tests I have to take at the METHADONE clinic. Of course I test positive for methadone, if I didn't that would be a whole other problem. They can definitely tell the difference between methadone and morphine and other opiates.

I went to the store and noticed lope comes in 2mg pills in packs of 18 42 and 95 and they were all quite pricey. Anyways, someone said I'm going to need 90mg or so at first.... so... what's going on here? Where do I find higher mg lope and cheaper so I can WD in comfort?

Pretty sure if the lope works out I won't need an answer on my next question. Dxm. I don't mess with it but thought it might be a good idea to start dosing myself with it before bed seeing how I can't sleep. Took unknown amount an hour ago and I feel super hyper like RLS inside my body and not tired. Should I just stop taking the dxm or did I just not take enough, or too much? 

Thanks guys! ",1384258172.0

What should I do?,"So, my friends have a very lax take on doing heroin.  I don't do drugs, so I have no idea if heroin can be done recreationally (as my friends believe) or if it's close to impossible to avoid addiction.  

I know my roommate has done it in the past, just to try it, which doesn't bother me in the slightest.  He's a young guy, very smart, introverted, pretty nerdy.  He works 10-12 hour days and was recently promoted.  His best friend does heroin often and lives down the street from us.

I came home from Maine yesterday and I don't think he expected me.  I went in the living room and saw paraphernalia for freebasing.  I smelled the metal tube and it gave off a sweet smell.  My friends confirmed with me that it's heroin.  My roommate was upstairs and he must've known I came home and saw the stuff.  We had a very brief, awkward conversation later on, but no mention of heroin.

My friends are divided on what I should do.  Some say it's not a big deal and to trust my roommate to be responsible, because he is a responsible guy.  Others believe that I should be extremely concerned.  I don't want to talk to him about it because when I've voiced my concerns for my other friends who do heroin, he sort of chastises me for overreacting.  That heroin is not as big of a deal as I'm making it out to be.

Please, do you have advice for me?  My plan is to ignore him until he speaks to me about what I saw in the living room and to only break the silence if I notice him doing it again.  Meh.",1384202667.0

We've all just welcomed the new year. My new year resolution was to fix my teeth. They were pretty bad - I've been abusing alcohol, being depressed, anxious etc. You know - sometimes you have those dark periods in your life and they take their toll on your health.

The problem was that I seriously hated dentists, there was no way I could visit one and not run away. To fight this, I bought some Codeine and took a sizeable amount of it. Then I headed to my appointment. 
Now keep in mind that I've been talking with this dentist for a few days via e-mail. To the day that I went there, I was 100% sure he will be male. The name on his website was male, the whole practice seemed to be his.

I go into this office, feeling warm inside from the opiate, I open the door, there is a giant mirror in front of me. The lights are really dim. I come closer, seeing myself totally relaxed.  Still, it's a fucking dental office, the hell on this earth.

Surprise, surprise! The dentist was supposed to be male but it turns out he was a SHE. A beautiful woman peeked at me from the other room, smiling. I swear I thought she's some sort of an elven princess. Between the dim lights and the opiate high, I really thought she was the most beautiful creature in this world. I stood there for a few seconds just looking at her.

Fuck me, I went from fearing dentists to loving each and every appointment. I was high, just lying on the dental chair, listening to music and looking at her starry, blue eyes. I loved every minute of it. She talked to me about her life, I was talking about mine, we connected. She was just starting her practice so there was no assistants or any of that, just me and her.  She talked about her family, her husband, her heart health problems, every fucking thing. She even called me once and just talked about her cardiologic results, lol! I could talk about anything when high. I think after the first few times I became limerent for her. I thought about the visits constantly. 

I got high on the opiates and visited her maybe 10 times total. There was this peculiar smell at the entrance, not some kind of a hospital smell - more like a perfume mixed with cleaning supplies or something. It smelled like heaven to me, lol. Then after the appointments, I always took a long walk - nothing greater than a evening walk, through snowy streets empty of people.
It may sound patethic but this is easily in the top3 of my life experiences. 

I no longer use any drugs and I haven't seen her in a year. I doubt she even knows how much I enjoyed her drilling in my teeth, lol.

Reddit itself I feel is a perfect sample of what I am talking about. Its like that in the majority of the subs on reddit. The circlejerk for drug use is pro pot / somewhat psychedelics and everything else is the devil / junkie drugs.
The misconceptions that are blatant in today's media is that if you use/abuse opiates even in a severely recreational fashion you are a terrible addict or the scourge of the lower class. 
I am unemployed as of yesterday but up in til then I was working in a marketing firm wearing a suit and tie to work everyday. I lead a fairly productive life work hard and IV drugs every single day. Heroin dillies suboxone ocs you name it.
Am I any different than a successful guy who wakes up and smokes a pipe in the morning and then another when I head to bed? 
No I'm sure not.
Do I get treated differently?
Absolutely.
There's a pretty unjust social stigma involved with opiate drug use.
I try not to let it bother me because I know that I am capable of managing my life, raising my son and being what is considered  the socially acceptable norm but still it eats away at me a bit just knowing that I am being judged pretty much based on sheer stupidity because the vocal majority have probably never tried it more than likely.
Do you ever see opiate abuse becoming more accepted in daily life, the way pot has more or less in the last few years?
The perception that all heroin/pill addicts are skinny dirty criminals with no goals of direction in life is pretty sad, but if you really think about it, its the news & media that do that. You don't see too many movies where the head attorney in a firm is bangin dope before he enters a court room or in the newspaper about a junkie who saves 10 little kids lives. You see movies like trainspotting or requiem and articles on 10 lb heroin seizures. 
Is there any way that us as a community could alter this image or are we doomed to live our lives at the bottom

Well at Mayo they found a ""abnormality"" which was told to me as a ""tumor"" or a ""growth"" depending on the doctor. Regardless of the doctor they all told me that they would not remove the tumor since they believe it is not cancerous and that time is the only thing that will help with a pain management plan.


Anyway I am currently on 25mcg/hr patches of fentanyl and am going to talk to my doctor tomorrow about going back to pills since they just arent working for me. First off I hate that it take 8-24 hours before these patches start working 100% and these aren't always giving a consistent dose and I can feel it not to mention that they don't stay on correctly or last the full 72 hours like they should (Mylan brand). 

So far I have been given MS Contin 30mg or so 2x daily then oxycontin 20mg 3x daily plus Percocet 10mg 3x daily and then Opana 20mg 2x daily with Percocet 10mg 3x daily. I want something to take care of the pain but something that I could take orally and still feel a pretty good buzz not just straight up nodding but be able to feel a light high from my normal dose. I would love to hear your suggestions on what I should ask for considering that my tolerance is pretty messed up thanks to trying all of these meds and I fear the fent really shot this up.


Thanks",1384326706.0

After deciding enough was enough,  I got fairly sick-- but only for a couple days. I've been through that 3-4 shitty days of WDs maybe twice in my life luckily, and it always followed a solid binge. So, things got bad money wise and the cravings were starting to take over so I quit. Again. 

Here we are, about a month and a half later and I just got a gram of dope and I'm about halfway through it. I feel pretty good but I can't help but think I'm about to fall into the same pattern (which would be really bad).  I think its important to mention that even when I was at my worst I was working 40 hours a week and rocking a 4.0 GPA... I'd like to think I'm a high functioning person and I can keep my balance regarding this shit but I'm not really sure.

TLDR: I just relapsed after a month and a half after quitting cold turkey. Kind of just wanted to get it off my chest.

In a typical day I will have anywhere from 2-5 30mg pills. Usually smoked, and usually shared with at least one other person. Typically we will have at least one day a week that we get at least 10. If we have the money we will consume up to 50-60 in a week. I deal with withdrawal symptoms when I can't get any either because town is empty or I don't have the money. Typically if we couldn't get 30s or didn't have enough money we would get some Heroin just to take care of the sickness and to get us through the day.
My question is that me and my smoking partner have been considering making the switch to suboxone (Buprenorphine) so that we can slowly work out of our addiction. I've been reading a lot on erowid and some other sites but I would also like some more opinions or experience stories. I'd really like to hear from someone that made the switch from oxys to subs.
Also the general conversion that I've been reading is approx. 2 mg bupe is about 60 mg oxy. That seems off to me. Anyone with experience with bupe like to chime in?
Last question is if it's absolutely necessary to go to a doc to start the process because I'm insurance-less until the first of the year, and I know people that sell in town but I keep reading that it's necessary to first have subutex before starting on suboxone, or am I misunderstanding that relationship?",1384304955.0

So my supplies have been free up until this point, but that ended and this past week I spent WAY too much money this week but have been trying to ween down but keep getting cravings to go overboard.  Since I constantly had a free supply, I haven't missed more than a day in over 5 years.

Anyways, I have some subs and am going on a trip for work for a week, so im going to use this as my mental excuse to get cleaned up. I have gone a day or two and gotten headaches, nausea, aches, but that's it. Is it because it hasnt been long enough to know if its going to be much worse? I am thinking about taking a few for the trip, but they will be calling my name. 

Is it even possible I will not get wds? Any advice related to the trip? Probably wishful thinking...


Edit for clarity: I have the subs from a Dr about 6 months ago and basically used the whole time anyway because I wasn't really ready to quit back then.  I guess here are some better questions. Would you try to quit like this on a trip because you really don't know anyone or have access for the intense cravings? What are the odds my WDs are really weak even after using for so long?

I did this 5 more times in the next few months, and then quit. About 6 months later, I learned from the show Intervention that you could smoke heroin. Since I hadn't learned how to inject myself, and always preferred to smoke any drug I took (I smoked weed regularly since I was 21. Before then I tried no drugs or alcohol at all), I decided to try smoking heroin. I did that a few times a week for about 6 months, realized I was spending too much money, and stopped. I had a few mild withdrawal symptoms. Since then, every 3-4 months or so, I buy some and smoke it. Then I don't touch it until 3-4 months later... even if I have some left over after that night that I buy it. This has been my pattern for 4 years. I don't do any other drugs except pot. I don't drink. People I know say I have the most unusual heroin/opiate habit they've ever heard of, and a lot of them say I'm going to get addicted eventually. I was wondering what you guys think? 

For me it's really just a way I have of super-relaxing, or sometimes of celebrating. I usually use it when I'm happy, or sometimes when I'm just in the mood. I almost always use alone because no one in my social group uses anything ""harder"" than pot or alcohol.

TL;DR I've been smoking heroin once every 3-4 months for years, and everyone says I'm eventually going to become an addict. ",1384380453.0

Okay, so I've been getting tar lately down here in Palm Beach County, Florida. The only other experiences I've had with heroin, was powder (garbage) I'd get back home (Brevard County). 

I've been buying bags that cost $40, no idea on weight. I do the whole bag and nod, not hard but, relative to my tolerance and money spent it's much better than spending equal money on pills. He'll even half a bag has me feeling good. 

Now, everything I've read, the rush is supposed to be magnificent. I really enjoy the rush I get but it's not very hard hitting. It's more subtle, like my ears kinda ring, or a wah wah wah feeling rather. And it's like being wrapped into a blanket, and the more I'm wrapped, the higher I am. 

Morphine & diladid on the other hand, and very in your face,knock your socks off type rushes. A mix of chills, pin and needles, and the ""it feels so good it hurts"" feeling. 

I know it's hard to describe what ones rush from a specific drug feels like, but does my explanation sound somewhat proper? 

I just had some, I wish I had taken a picture but, I've included pictures to give you an idea of what I'm getting.

My mother is an opiate addict but that is because she has legitimate pain problems that are chronic.  She doesn't rob/kill/steal/treat people badly and is actually one of the best people I know.

So when I take Oxy, I can rock a 30 at a time and feel fantastic -- takes care of pain and puts me in a nice spot...and then I'll take one or two more 30s throughout the day and still get to where I want to be. It's lovely. 

BUT...when I am short on pills, I have a friend of a friend situation that helps me out with grabbing some 7.5 hydros. Now, I basically just use these as a last resort if I can't get my hands on OC, but I've noticed something strange...when I take a 7.5, it FUGGS me up. It's not like the OC feeling, which for me is the ultimate, but a very different, almost jittery feeling. Pain wise, it's not as effective, but there is a hyper-activity level with a single hydro that there's no way I even come close if I were to only take 7.5 of OC. 

Does this happen to any of you guys? Why do I seem to react more strongly to Hydro than OC? Like I said, it's not as enjoyable, and not as effective for pain, but definitely throws me into a stronger, almost dizzying sensation.

(Although I could not find a single pharmacy that would fill it--I problem I never had in Massachusetts). Then things got weirder.

Now all of sudden--I've been told regulations have been changed. My pain is so bad--I literally faint and pass out from it. All that I got was 20 5mg/apaps! I don't have a history of abuse, and the doctors told me they would prescribe me more, but regulations have changed, and they are on a tighter leash. I even had a psychiatric evaluation to judge my mental state aka see if I had a substance abuse problem--all clear.

I've also tried every other pain killer, medical marijuana. And opiates are the only thing that helps.

Can someone explain specifically what regulations changed? I had to go 2 or 3 pharmacies to get my scripts filled, because they didn't want to do it or didn't have enough. The dilaudid, I literally had to go 15 miles to get filled. 

I had a tooth break this week, when I fainted. I need a root canal and it kills--the dentist told me to take ibuprofen. I've had tooth issues before and always get some kind of opiate. He also said something about regulations changing, and if the pain keeps up to come back later.

What changed? Does California have some kind of weird wacky rule that doesn't exist in Massachusetts or other states?

I was clean for a month. I checked myself into rehab, sick of the daily grind, with a g a day habit (for me, small) with valium (prescribed) on top. I was sick of living my life on the chase. 24/7, wake up, hustle, spend my last few hours conscious enjoying numb, warm bliss. And then wake up, scramble for the needle, and the rush is on to find a vein before the dry heaves start. Low blood pressure in the morning was such a bitch to me. Sitting in the bottom of the shower, letting the hot water run down my body. Still cold, oh so cold. Where are my veins? More importantly, where is the life I dreamed of as a little girl? For seven years, my life force has been oozing out of the tip of a 29g 1cc ""insulin"" needle (as if by calling them insulin needles, the pharmacist can eye my track marks and decide, ""Maybe she's anemic *and* diabetic?""). Heroin, sweet, cruel mistress. She gave me so much. Now all she does is take.




30 days clean, and after ten minutes at home, I had scraped my using area with a credit card and slammed the resulting powder (and no doubt dust) as fast as if my ass were on fire. I found some syringes I'd squirreled away. It felt nice to be clean, but not *right*. I had a tiny nagging voice in my head, whispering sweet nothings, dark joy. I knew I'd get high again right out of the gate. I didn't go in with reservations, but they did their booking weeks in advance.





Monday, the day I return to my grind. I'll have the cash, the ride, the connect. I should be afraid. I'm not. Ashamed, admittedly a bit. Some days I feel the needle was my calling card, my destiny. I will die a junkie death, and oh, what sweet release that will be. My blood pressure is sky high. I can actually see my veins. I crave the flag, the tear of the rig as it parts the skin, sinks into my veins, releases its poison, gives me all I need to feel right, all I need to go on in this dark world. No matter how many times I turn my back on her, how low the depths of my addiction. It doesn't matter.





One more time, I tell myself yet again.

So yesterday, I did a bunch of chores, including getting a massive old television out of my apartment. Didn't sleep well last night and woke up like my ribs and back were on fire. I have a bottle of Vicodin from a kidney stone scare a year or so ago. I keep it around for when my usual dose of ibuprofen and acetaminophen won't deal with whatever pain I'm suffering. 

I've only ever taken one pill at a time. 

Today, I took two. I was upset that the pain was that bad, that soon after waking up. They killed the pain in about 30 minutes. After about an hour, I had this sense of warmth and well-being. That must have been the least taste of what an opiate high must be.

I'm happy to know what it does feel like, but deal with enough addictive drives as it is. 

I will only ever take one pill at a time again. ",1384649568.0

The part that I hate most about withdrawal is the RLS. I hate not being able to sleep because of it.
I was thinking that if I kept a little bit, about 2-3 points, I could just smoke a tiny amount before bed along with some pot some other sleep-aid. Then when I woke up just take lope throughout the day.


 I don't have access to benzos.


If I did this would I just be extending my w/ds until I stopped smoking? Would it only add a little bit of time to my w/ds?

First time quitter.,"So ive been using for the past 5 months and havent taken a suboxone save one time two months ago. I got back with an old flame who had fell in love with opiates since our love faded and i fell for her and the needle. Watched myself spend thousands of dollars that i risked my life and freedom for just to numb myself for a couch. She knew what was happening and so did i, but i had a taste now, and didnt even let her stop me. Her tolerance was always higher but i mainly supplied it, and im at the point where any money i get is serious real life money and cant go to drugs. I have a shitty drug case pending in Sc and maybe this experiejce might help me paint myself in a differrnt light to the court (rather than admit i was selling drugs while only casually drinkingnand smoking ganj). So now that we are both strugglin for money we fight more, dont get any time to enjoy the high. Its a sickening realization but im glad i am making it. Love + Heroin is the ultimate Romeo and Juliet tragedy, straight forbidden love. So now even though i have a newfoujd love for the needle and the ability to get money (even though i coukd only last a couole days before ultimate brokenesa) i have to stop and am relieved to finally see what i have to go thru to have my life back. 

I dont even know why i posted this cause i started using this subreddit as a outlet while high or waiting to cop and now i am seeing the innate indiscriminate evil of opiates and their effects on myself and my peers. So many kids i graduated from in 09 from a suburban ma town are users on and off. I only recently got on the train and i want off, but i need to want to get clean and not just be well til i have money. I last got high 31 hours ago and just took prob a third of an orange sub. I feel a lot better and am not freakijg out about my relationship and habit. I hope all of u guys are well, i must admit id love to do a shot as many as u have today, but the old me, hidden and dormant behind a fog of love, dependance and denial, is finally awakening and realizing what must be done.

Day 2 - half strip (3.5 strips left)
Day 3 - half strip (3.0 strips left)
Day 4 - half strip (2.5 strips left)
Day 5 - half strip (2.0 strips left)

She's like the girlfriend you love unconditionally when she's around, but as soon as she leaves you, [even if just for a day or so] you fucking hate her so god damn much. The pain she causes you, physically and emotionally, is too much to handle sometimes.

*Anyways, the first time I ever ""quit"" a really bad heroin habit [IVing] I didn't have the luxury of Suboxone. I was kinda naive back then. I basically did it cold turkey, hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but I did it. I was clean for about 2.5 months and fuck I was feelin' great. Getting some old friends back, seeing my family more, life was great. 

And then my grandpa died. 

Guess who was there to hold me and comfort me? Yeah, *her. My exgirlfriend called me up telling me she's sorry and all that. She told me to come over because she's got something for me, something to make me feel better. I knew what it was, I shouldn't have done it, but I did. 

Fast forward. I pick up the habit again here and there. Sometimes I went really fucking hard or maybe just a piece a day. Either way, by the end of the day, I was fucking sick. Fuck I hate being sick. 

Suboxone, that's what this is about, I keep straying. So I have this friend who's been my best friend for over 2 years now. He was selling dope at one point so I was goin' up to the city with him everyday doing *fat *ass *shots multiple times a day. His addiction always got so much worse than mine, he's a much bigger [not so much fat really, just *big] than me so he'd end up doing so much more to get high, resulting in a much stronger addiction. Well this friend got prescribed Suboxone. When he's get then he'd throw me some to help me get clean. He's done this a few times now and it's worked for a week or so but I always get so bored and end up back on the shit. 

Not this time. I've gotta stay strong. Two days ago he threw me four Suboxone. It doesn't sound like much, but for where my habits at this is a godsend. I split the first one in half and that'll last me for two days. Over the next few days I'll split the rest into thirds and just one Sub will last me for *three days!

May you feel as I felt, see as I saw, and learn to accept the life that fate has dealt you with good grace and an open heart.





--------------**FOREWORD**----------------------



In the meeting halls of Narcotics Anonymous, people from all walks of life set aside our differences (if only for the duration of the meeting) and instead focus on what we have in common - the monkey clinging to our back; the devil on our shoulder; our personal Jiminy Cricket, incessantly chirping away in our subconscious. We are united by the void in our souls. We are bound and shackled by addiction. And we all want something different. Something to relieve our burden of self without destroying ourselves, and the lives of everyone around us.




I slam heroin, crying silently in frustration as my family - the one my addiction took the place of - sits in the next room, watching television. Oblivious, thank the God I don't believe in, to my tears as I pierce my skin over and over, arms bloody, the needle unable to find its mark.


Another woman sees her family disintegrating before her very eyes. She takes another hit of crack as her hungry child wails from his crib in another room, his diaper swollen with two days worth of shit and piss. Out of sight, out of mind, as the saying goes.


Yet another addict is on his knees, getting face-fucked by his dealer for an extra pill or two. He attempts to block it out, closing his eyes. He tries not to think about the new Nikes on the man's feet, the new flat screen television on the wall in the living room. These are luxuries paid for expressly by the pathetic bastards that gladly sell the food from right out of their children's mouths for just... one... more. He chokes down the dope man's hot load of jizz, wipes saliva from his chin, and accepts his prize like a sprinter who just broke the tape. Then he slinks away, thoughts of what just happened buzzing in his head, like a million bees on wings of despair. Angry. Disgusted. Violated. But the pills, his prize, graze his fingers and he puts his hands in his shabby old coat. And in that moment, that is the feeling of victory.



Until our bags are empty, we rest easy. We function flawlessly, the general population unaware of the synthetic strings that hold us addicts up. We are the puppets, our dealers the puppeteers.



While our pasts, our drugs of choice, or the exact moment we say ""enough is enough"" may be as varying as the pattern of a snowflake, what binds us here is the recognition of the beast we cannot tame, and the desire to reach out for help.


Those that wish to speak may raise their hand and be allowed to discuss whatever is on their mind, sharing personal thoughts and feelings with other group members. Strangers though we may be, we understand. We sympathize and we offer up our support sans judgment. As per the guidelines of NA, sharing is to be limited to five minutes per person to ensure that everyone has the chance to get things off their chest. Oftentimes, though, the emotions in the room are so elevated that we allow those in need of moral support the most to completely rid themselves of every last demon plaguing them. If we as a group turned our back on any fellow in need, then we are not holding to the camaraderie that is the foundation of this program. The term for allowing a fellow addict to share beyobnd the time constraints is known as a ""burning desire""; something they MUST get off their chest for fear of the results of bottling it up those thoughts and letting them fester in our heads. Left unaddressed, they eat away at our psyche and seem to multiply. Relapse, suicide, self-harm... these are only a few of the repercussions that can arise when we allow the hurt to eat at us for too long. This book is the embodiment of my ""burning desire"" to share.



Whenever I doubt myself, questioning my decision to put down the needle and choose life over a slow suicide, I will have this book to reflect back upon and see all the harm I've done, to myself and others, over the years. I have the ability to relive my life as an addict through these pages, and I will be able to recognize the complete one-eighty my life has made since those times. It is my hope that those who still struggle with the beast of addiction will find solace in my success, and are able to relate, in some way, to my own struggles. I write with the hope of encouraging those who need it. I write with the hope that my story will discourage anyone who may be toying with the idea of drug usage and see that the life of your average addict is not glamorous or pretty. I pray that families who find themselves broken and dispirited by a loved one's active addiction see that change IS possible. Giving up is NEVER an option if they truly want to see that person rise from their own ashes someday and take flight on their own journey of recovery. It is my intention to provide answers to those who ask ""Why?"" daily, and to offer a candid look inside the mind of a drug addict.


This book, while written for all of the above reasons, is also for my family, who stood beside me in my darkest hours. Without their love and support, I would have surely met my end long ago.


To my mother, father, stepfather, and siblings: I love you all dearly and can only let the wounds I have inflicted heal with time and my continued effort to build myself a life worth living.



Once, I was broken, down, and out. Not so long ago, I was dead inside, actively pursuing my own burial plot and tombstone. Today, I am alive. I am fighting my way out of the deep, dark abyss I have created. My hands grasp toward the light. Today, with hope, positivity, and love, I can live a life I have never known in my wildest dreams.



May this book open eyes, heal hearts, and inspire the courage needed to persevere. Life will always be what you choose to make it. Choose wisely.

I've been staying at my parents house for the past month, between the time when my lease ended and when I can move cross-country. It's been really hard, in part because I'm broke and they live in the middle of nowhere and I don't have a car or any real friends here. But also because there are ghosts here for me. 

I didn't have the easiest time growing up here, by any means, and there are memories in this house that I don't want to remember, and no way of escaping them. And I also lived here with my boyfriend who OD'd 11 years ago, and he is all over this house too, and recently I was cleaning out my closet and found a lot of stuff of his that I didn't know was here. Like his notebook, which has love letters to me that I have never read before. And every time I go outside I remember me and him smoking cigarettes out there, and every time I fall asleep I remember me and him sleeping. And I can't talk about this with anyone because I don't want people to know that it still fucking kills me to think about. 

I have to get out of here. Or talk to someone about it. Too many memories, too many ghosts, and I can't escape, and I can't get high, and it's too fucking much.

So I've got the drs on lock. I can walk in to any urgent care and get a script for my doc. Tried and true. No MRI, no history, just straight ballin up in there sellin the drs. Anyway, after a recent successful trip to a local urgent care, I headed on over to the cvs. Since I've only been in this area for about 4 weeks and I've already grabbed 6 refills from 3 diff docs in that time period, my focus in the cvs is building quality rapport with the pharmacists and techs so they dnt think I'm just gettin high(6scripts in 4 weeks how could I not be lol) I'd like to add that I'm 25/m. One tip I could add is don't be all about ur script. Shoot the shit pharmacist and be nice and PATIENT!! While I'm waiting on my script to be filled, asshole walks back to pharmacy, slams his scripts on the counter and starts (obnoxiously loud) to discuss how he's been to 7 different pharmacys and hasn't been able to get his scripts filled. He's dressed like a dirtbag and being a genuine asshole which really pissed me off. We are both in the pharmacy looking to get our respective fixes, but this dude is fuckin it up for everyone.  He attempts to cut me in line to get his fix, and this really pisses the pharmacist off. She's a cute small framed girl, and this dude totally rubs her the wrong way so she tells him he's Guna have to wait(duh). He leaves and I get my script which is fucking awesome. As I'm walking out 2 cops roll up to deal with the asshole. Moral of the story: don't be a dick. Be pleasant. Dress like you have something else going on in your life besides getting high everyday, even if that's what you do. This dude was ruining it for the rest of us. I'm glad he got popped. And if you are an asshole like him I hope you get popped too. Be nice, be patient, and enjoy your high.

As a result of my never-ending anxiety and infinite sadness that keeps plaguing me, day in and day out, I relapsed and have been back on meds for the last week or so. I just feel super alone and have no one to talk to so I started taking pills again to fill the loneliness I have an overabundance of.

I don't even know, at this point, if I want to get back on the wagon because I'm afraid of how lonely sobriety is. If anyone's available to talk, though, PM me cuz I could use someone to talk to.

He was always loud and never cared what anyone heard. The guy was telling us he could hear us, and my buddy said ""Shut it, I am trying to get high"". When he left the bathroom, he said he was going to tell the manager. I was pretty pissed, because I really didn't want a scene. I did everything I had and walked out. 

Since it was the middle of the night, none of the employees had anything worthwhile to do. When we walked out, there was a group of employees just staring at us. They were all loudly whispering ""what do we do to"" each other. Nobody did anything. We walked between them and went about our business. We got followed the entire time by multiple people. My buddy was just eating a magnum ice cream bar walking through the store. When he got to the counter he grabbed some airheads and told the cashier he was taking them. The cashier was kind of in shock and didn't say a word. We left after that, and I stopped hanging out with that dude. He always caused trouble when I was around him.

I need to get this off my chest to people who might understand, and maybe it can help some.","**TL;DR Mom addicted to vicodin and meth. Got help. Getting off my chest.**

I was hitting the ""random"" button and stumbled on this sub.

My mom has had 4 neck surgeries in 10 years. Something about disks slipping and vertebrates and such. She hasn't had one in years, but I remember all of them (besides one when she was about 13). It was definitely within 10 years.

But in between surgeries, she was stuck on painkillers and all types of meds. Her neck was bad. Since I was little I was giving her massages, my older brother was best at it though. But she didn't have little knots or stress you had to *break apart* the muscle. I can last for a long time, I've learned to be pretty alright with massages, but with her I couldn't last more than 10 minutes. Her neck was *bad*. I can't stress it enough.

But anyway, that's besides the point. Somewhere along the line she moved to opiates. I can't stress how bad she was enough. It wasn't just a neck that was tough to massage. That's just a detail that I really remember vividly because I've done it so often since I was little. But she would lay in agony if she didn't have her pills. Combine that with **insomnia and major depression.** 

**I can't explain her pain. I really wish I could.**

But *anyways*, **somewhere along the line she moved to opiates.** I don't know where or when, but **she became addicted.** My uncle told my little sister and I that thousands of people in her condition turn to opiates, and none of us will *ever* know how it feels to be in the pain she's in. 

And then the opiates weren't enough. She got a boyfriend who promised to take care of her, has two kids, got along with me well, and I consider his oldest son to be my brother. He's as much a brother to me as my blood-brother is, and therefore we just introduce each other as brother. We call each other brother, refer to each other as brother, that's my brother.

Well her boyfriend, who we'll call Christian, has some drug connections. I knew he did coke, but I think I repressed this memory. I think my mom only told me that he *had* done it, not that he does it. He knew about her condition, he has strong hands, so he was good with massages. 

**But he introduced her to meth,** and for six years, she would use it. So she was constantly on vicodin and meth. The vicodin wasn't enough, the physical and emotional pain wouldn't subside, so she self-medicated with crystal meth.

I found about her addiction pretty early, but I thought it was lies and blocked that out too. But she showed signs. She would be up at 4am cleaning and cleaning and cleaning (no work, doctor said due to her neck injuries she couldn't work) and she would have these crazy mood swings and we would be yelling back and forth and I accused her of being bipolar and really tried to help, but she wasn't bipolar. She was just addicted to all sort of things. 

A couple years into their relationship, all of my family hated Christian. He's a scumbag. But I couldn't figure out why she was so dependent on him. Why he always found a way back into our life even though we moved and she promised he wouldn't know where we lived. She wasn't lying either, she was *really* trying to get away from him. She'd wanted help for so long but was afraid to ask for it. The first night we moved in, there had been a car that tailed us for a while, making the same turns and such, and she got anxious. After we made a turn, she turned around and chased it down to try to catch Christian following us. It turns out it was just an old couple. Coincidence. But she was scared. She wanted to get away from him. 

But she always went back. ""He's buying me groceries because I need all the help I can get."" ""He knows he owes me."" ""I need this money."" That's how he got to her. I thought it was just money. We're really broke and do need all of the help we can get but we have a wonderful family that helps every chance they can get. But I understood. She doesn't want to rely on handouts. 

But this is getting too long. Fast forward. Lately my sister and I would wake up and she wouldn't be home. This only happened at most four times, but we were worried. She has some bad friends, people she grew up with, and though my mom broke that cycle, not many of them did. But she's the most generous, caring, helpful woman you'll ever meet. She did everything for them. But there were some she would use with too. But anyway, I would just shut the door and take my sister and I to school. We'd come home from school, she'd be home, but I wouldn't ask questions. It was half trust and half not wanting to know.

My brother, my blood brother, we'll call him Andrew, was working some odd jobs. He and his girlfriend had just broke up so he's been living with us for a little bit. He's 11 years older than me. I'm 17 (18 in a month if it matters). He did some trucking work, so he'd be gone for weeks at a time, and didn't contact us much. He's an independent guy who can take care of himself. About a week before my mom's 50th birthday, he had to leave. Before he left he pulled my sister and I aside and told us he was going to miss my mom's birthday, and to make sure she had a *really* good time. It was important. Make sure she has fun. It was weird and I shrugged it off but kept it in mind.

The party was great. All of my family was there. My mom looked beautiful, we played all of her music, everyone took pictures, I'm really glad my girlfriend got to be there. There was tons of dancing and drinks and friends and music and it lasted all night. One of my uncles pulled me aside during the party, and told me that he was going to pick up my sister and we were going to eat in the morning, but to make sure my mom did *not* know. My first thought was drugs. The memory I had of hearing her on meth years ago flashed in my mind, but I pushed it aside. Just breakfast. 

My mom was really tired, but we got home at around 1. We talked about the party a bit, hugged her goodnight, and all went straight to bed. I was up a little bit, talking to my girlfriend, and after she fell asleep I was trying to fall asleep. Everything was quiet, all of the lights were off, and I thought I was the only one up. But then I heard my mom's door open and boots leave out the front door. I was scared, I don't know why. I just didn't know where she could be going or why she was leaving. I thought she was asleep just a second ago. I pushed it out of my mind and fell asleep.

The next morning I woke up around 7, tiptoeing to get dressed, my sister was doing the same. But when I stepped out of my room, my mom's door was open and no one was there. She never came home last night. I was hurt. I closed the door and left. My uncle asked if she knew we had left, I told him she wasn't home. He looked hurt too. 

Over breakfast he and his SO told us that for months, my family had been planning an intervention. My mom was addicted to pain pills. He didn't mention meth, but I knew. And I think he knew that I knew.  But they found a great rehab clinic that specializes in chronic pain, and they would be able to help my mom. It was the best around. We met at another uncle's house and all of my aunts and uncles were there. My sister and I prepared letters, bottom lines. We shared them aloud. It was a practice run. It was really emotional. Then my aunt got a text from my mom. ""Where are the kids? Did you get them?"" (We're a really close family. This happens all the time) So we knew she was home. We left, got there, definitely surprised her, and after the first letter, she replied yes. But we read all of ours. 

She really wanted help. She was tired of staying her room all day, leaving parties early, being dead tired from the opiates but can't sleep from the meth. It was an easy yes. Everyone cried.

She was at a place called Hemet two hours away from home, and we were able to see her every weekend. it was hell. Through all of those drugs, she **ALWAYS** had her head on straight. Never was she incapable of caring for us or anybody. I don't know how she did it. It's like she was almost exception story there is about addicts, besides how she felt about herself, and some of her behavior. But to do all of the things she did, and for *years?* She's an amazing woman. I love her to death. So I couldn't wait for the month to be over and have her home again. But I didn't let her know, because I'd rather her get better. She got home after the month, and we pretty much had a party. Some of my cousins slept over, she got us a bunch of Redbox movies and junkfood. But that night she left again. And she was back in rehab. She couldn't fight the anxiety. I tried not to cry in front of my cousins. I didn't. I was just sad. 

She didn't stay home until June, (she left early April) But now she's much better. It's the ""old"" her to most, but the ""new"" her to me, at least for my memory. Our relationship is much better than ever, and she's still the sweetest woman. But she got better. I love it.

I decided to post here because after reading a few posts, I thought at least you guys would understand some of it. Maybe you can relate or something. But only about three close friends know about this, and they could never understand. I won't ever understand what she went through, but you guys can. So it feels better coming out here.

And there is help. If anyone's self-medicating now, and feel like you can't get off because nothing else will help, that's what my mom and I thought too. My uncle said it was something like the pills would deaden her body's ability to fight pain, and so they got weaker and weaker. But the rehab was able to help it with therapy, and now all she takes is Ibuprofen! It's amazing! She's not completely painless, but she can bear it. Not even vicodin would let her bear it. So there's help. Definitely. It just felt good to get it off my chest to people who would understand. It helps me

This piece was frustrating me for a bit. I couldn't position it for the longest time but am finally satisfied. This was done on only MS paint. You can draw some pretty awesome stuff if you're motivated enough. I'm downloading GIMP right now, so I think it'll end up epic.




Currently, I'm scribbling away, trying not to nod in front of the computer with my paremts in the room. I finally got a solid connect today after my boys got busted. It's some amaaaazing gunpowder. I picked up a fresh pack of rigs and as of four hours ago entered the realm of heroin bliss after 30+ days sober. Woot!

I stopped taking kratom since while waiting for test results I was becoming paranoid (justifiably concerned?) about the effects kratom could be having on my health. At this point I don't know if I can handle the anxiety of waiting for test results (only partially mitigated by the clonazepam) and the dysphoria of kratom PAWS at the same time. I figured a low dose of codeine might take the edge off, and I'd rather take codeine than go back to kratom - codeine has been much more thoroughly studied than kratom, which is after all a complex cocktail of different alkaloids.

I've been IVing opiates for the last 2 years (been prescribed opiates for the last 6 for chronic pain / health issues.) Started on suboxone 2.5 years ago, thought ""well, this is a bunch of shit. Now I just hurt and am not high at all"" and started IVing within 6 months.


Because of my medical issues, I need pretty regular, intensive tests. I've been avoiding them like the fucking plauge since I started shooting up since I cannot show my arms to any medical technician - for blood pressure, for IVs, for anesthesia - without them knowing what's up. Absolutely no one knows I've been IVing except my dealer. Not my husband, not my doctors, not my physical therapist (he knows my arms are a mess obviously, but he accepts that I do not want to discuss it.)


I've been putting off this medical test for almost a year because I'm too afraid to face the anesthesiologist and nurses. I DO NOT want them to disclose my situation to the doctor performing the test - because he may disclose to my main doctor. I've cancelled it multiple times, but somehow convinced myself that it would be okay and to just go ahead and have the test done.


Now it's the night before the test, and I am in a full-blown panic attack. I can still cancel in the morning for a nominal fee, but my husband would be irate about the fee, plus be very suspicious as to WHY I did so.


I managed to stop shooting up for most of the last month, but fell off the wagon last week friday, and shot up fri-sat-sun-mon-tues. So the issue now isn't that I have any drugs in my system that should't be there - it's that my arms are all tore up again, and my grand plan of telling the nurse / anesthesiologist I'm a ""former"" junkie is out the window.


Does anyone know if nurses and anesthesiologists in California are allowed to disclose the fact you're a user if you tell them not to? Is anyone here medical personnel? Do you folks care one way or another about ratting out junkies who need legit medical treatment?

Thanks is advance for any advice you can give. I'm seriously having a full-blown meltdown (and my usual method for dealing with it - cooking up a lovely, soothing shot - is not an option tonight.)

UPDATE: it's all good, kids. They let me keep my long-sleeved tissue tee on under the BP monitor, and I asked the nurse if she'd mind doing the IV in my hand (I told her in my prior experiences that works best for me.) I put band-aides over the fresh stuff, and no one had any issues with it. Medical test complete! Thanks for all the input.",1385096625.0

So a few days ago, I came across [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1qtc2s/how_i_finally_got_high_off_of_anti_poop_pills/), claiming someone had found a way to get high off of Loperamide. I was skeptical as anyone. I was as skeptical as many of the people in this thread are going to be. I thought it was bullshit and a placebo. After trying it, I am convinced I was wrong to be a naysayer. It worked. I am gonna try it again because I believe this method deserves more attention.

Last time I did it, I didn't feel a dirty high. I felt like I took 40mgs of hydrocodone. I know that sounds outlandish. I guess the only thing I can say to the people who won't believe me is to try it for themselves. 

Oh, and I shit the next day due to some laxatives. The constipation was just as bad as any opiate i've ever taken.

T-0:00 four 200mg Tagamet pills

T-0:30 A shit ton of black pepper. I parachuted it. I chugged it with water. I mixed it with coke (didnt taste like Dr. Pepper).

T-0:05 Stomach ache from all the pepper. I wish I had capsules. If you do this, get some empty pill capsules. The pepper is the worst part.

T+0:00 Took 40 2mg immodium pills. Hard to get down because of the pepper stomach ache. 

T+0:40 Stomach ache from the pepper. I overdid it this time with the fucking pepper. No more pepper ever. Fuck pepper.

T +4:00 Oops. I fell asleep. Woke up, less of s stomach ache. Eyes pinned. Feeling pretty good, Need to pee. I had NO idea i had fallen asleep for that long.  I was only laying down. Gonna drift back to sleep.

T+ 4:30 I am sleepy and I have the hiccups. I am slightly itchy, and spaced out. MY stomach has settled. I am gonna take another 30mgs. All that pepper gave me gas. Feeling opiate-like effects.  * hiccup *

T + 8:00 Still feeling it. It feels like I drank 3/4ths of my usual dose of poppy seed tea. I feel buzzy and itcny and warm and I am in a great mood. I was nodding a bit about an hour ago. I am gonna dose another 30 mgs. No stomach ache anymore. I havent looked in the mirror, but I am sure I have pinned eyes and look have my usual drug face. I've got work in a few hours, so I am gonna drink some coffee amd ride out the day. I think i'll feel great though. I actually love caffeine + opiates. This is gonna be the most ghetto speedball ever.

T+ 9:00 Just smoked two cigarettes. I noticed increased effects, started nodding. I am nodding as I type this. Feeling very nauseous. This happens often when I smoke cigarettes on opiates. 

T+ 9:30 Going to get ready for work. Still feeling it. Taking my last few pills to work. Going to take my daily 1mg of klonopin. Going to get some coffee on the way to work. I might update while at work. 


Also, just because you don't agree with what I am doing, doesn't mean you should downvote me. I feel like this is valuable information. There are threads all over the internet debating whether or not you can get high off of lope, and i've managed to do so. Have a nice day, everyone.",1385091952.0

Roxis are my doc, been using for almost a year. I've only ever been a week or so between roxis, which I only started doing recently to cut back. Prior to about a month ago, I was snorting dozens a week on a daily basis. I've developed a pretty high tolerance, and I've only ever snorted or eaten them. Moving up to heroin was never really an option for me. The whole needle stigma and all that, I know I know, roxis are basically pharmaceutical heroin. 
Anyways, I finally decided to try heroin a few weeks back. It was good shit, I got high, wasn't as scary as I thought, all that. It just didn't seem that spectacular to me. I liked it, but I didn't love it like I was expecting. My bf couldn't believe that I didn't love it, and concluded I wasn't doing enough and was being overly cautious. (I'm a nervous person, and only did a little bit at a time until I got high). 
So, on Tuesday he decided we were gonna get fucked up. I was down, as always, so we went and picked up a gram of some good shit. We got high, and didn't stop. We got to where we had about .3 left, and split it. Granted, I was already to the point of fucked-up-ness that I was just babbling gibberish between nods. After that last bit, everything in my memory is black. 
I'm relatively certain i OD'd (I'm prescribed klonopin too and had taken ummm a few of those before we got the dope). Apparently after that last bit, I was just out for a minute. Eventually I came back to, not that I remember. I woke up the next morning (yesterday) with no memory whatsoever, confused, and scared shit less. I felt as if I'd been run over by a bus and I was more emotional than a pregnant woman and cried half the day for no reason. Worst drug hangover I've ever had by far. 
I've never heard of people blacking out memory wise because of heroin, but it scared me badly enough that I don't plan on ever touching the shit again. Maybe some people like that shit and that's how it's supposed to be? Idk, or maybe I'm just weird? ",1385059716.0

Luckily my wife is still none the wiser, but I am beginning to hate the constant dishonesty I bring to the table. The constant lies about where I am going, how much is in the bank, why am I feeling shit again.

I keep telling myself that ""This will be the last lot."", but it never is.

Its getting real close to the anniversary of my fathers death, a time of year that I still really struggle with. 17th Dec. He couldn't have timed it any worse as I used to love the build up to Xmas. Now I wish it would never come.

So I keep going out to chip, anything to take my mind of the one image I can't get out of my head. My father covered from head to toe in blood he had just coughed up in the street. For 20 mins not a single fucking cunt came to offer help, walking round us like he had the plague or something.

Then the ambulance arrived, but by then it was too late. He died of lung cancer. He was getting better, the cancer was shrinking, but managed to attach its self to an artery in his lung. He coughed and it tore.

I miss my father and still do not cope with the fact he is gone. So I go buy more dope to help me deal with it.

And so the cycle continues.......",1385181579.0

It was alright. I was a little bit annoyed or something the whole time I was up on it, other than that I didn't notice a whole lot. So my SO and I get the bright idea to cut back on opiates and supplement with Meth since its so much cheaper. Just until we get back on our feet. Ha. Someone really should have told me that was going to be a horrible idea! I don't even remember the last week or so...literally, I have very few flashes in my head of how my days went. I honestly wonder if I will even remember writing this. Not sure if it's the drug or other reasons but my SO and I are totally at each others throats...he is driving me crazy. I wanna punch him in the throat, which is weird since he's so nice to me. I even started to move my stuff out yesterday because I was so mad. I was a crazy bitch. Throwing and breaking stuff....I've never acted like that in my life. I've never been so angry in my life. Apparently all he could get me to eat for the last five days was some yogurt. I'm not hungry...my lips are so dry. I feel like I should pray to the opiate gods for forgiveness....I miss heroin so much. I miss getting along with my guy...I miss my sex drive from opiates.

Today I find myself broke and in debt with no way I can get high, but I do have a subutex in my pocket which will make the weekend much easier to swallow. Anyway, I was just listening to ""river of deceit"" by mad season and it got me thinking about layne staley. Such a crazy and sad story. The guy wanted nothing more than to be a star and sing in a rock band, and he got all of that tenfold, and he threw it all away for heroin. Not your typical ""od's and dies on tour at the peak or cusp of stardom"", no, staley battled drug addiction his entire Alice in chains career, he was addicted before they even released an album. And tours were canceled, albums delayed, and his public image became that of the most famous junkie in the world. And then he just decided to say fuck it. He recorded and played his last show with chains in 95, made an album with mad season, and subsequently disappeared for 7 years. 7 years he became a hermit, he used his wealth to sit in an apartment and shoot dope for 7 years, completely fading from the public eye, until his death in 2002. It blows my fucking mind. He had everything anyone could ever want, a loyal woman, millions of dollars and adoring fans, and he didn't even try to continue on with a habit or get clean. He just gave up and let his addiction overtake him. Anyone familiar with his music can tell you how dark and sad the drug made him, but it just had it's hands around his neck and never let go. It really depresses me, because I don't have anything right now. I live with my parents, my gf won't see me, and my job barely pays for my dope much less bills and any kind of normal life. How am I going to quit when dope is the only thing that makes me happy, when a guy that had everything I could ever want threw it all down the shitter for dope. I'm just being dramatic, we all use and then quit for different reasons, and I shouldn't compare my life to a rock star that developed a big time habit when methadone was the only maintenance drug there was. But it's something I'm thinking heavily about. I'm so deep into this shit I know I will always be an addict, I'm broke and living with my parents, that alone should be enough motivation to quit and save some money. But I haven't. I keep convincing my self that I should get high. It's a fucking sad thing, dope addiction, and unless you've lived it you just can't understand it.

If you can provide sources to back your claims please do. 

Usually my friends and I just get cheese(tar cut with Benadryl or manitol) and use a heat lamp to dry it out and a blade to get it into a powder to snort. I know if you get a drip it's practically a waste but we do pretty good of keeping it in our nasal membrane till it's absorbed. 
What Do you guys think of this? 

The other way is we either let the cheese or raw dissolve in water then use an eye dropper or oral syringe to squirt it into our nose while laying with our heads upside down (to keep it in the nasal membrane). 
What do you guys think of this? (Better or worse than snorting cheese?)

My last questions are my friend told me when you mix it with water it reacts and turns into morphine. Is this true? When we do monkey(tar/cheese) water is it really morph water? If true how long does it take to turn? 

Oh yeah does anyone have any experience pluggin using an oral syringe to squirt the cheese/tar water rectally? What's the bioavailability? Is this safe?

It's just we usually only get cheese around here and I'm looking to get the most bang for my buck without iv'ing(not judging just too addictive for me;I only have once and still think about it 3 yrs later)
Also if there is a better subreddit to ask this, please direct me.

If you guys have any other ways you do cheese or tar feel free to comment! 

TL;DR: what do you think of snorting cheese(cut tar)? What do you think of squirting cheese/tar water into your nose?does h turn into morphine when dissolved in water? Can you plug tar/cheese water? What's the bioavailability of each route and how do you (non-ivers) use H? ",1385307509.0

If she had any intention of getting sober I'd be there all the way but she's made it very clear that she has no desire to do that and that I can never trust her. I'll live the rest of my days knowing she's doing this to herself and I'll never understand the grip heroin has on her. This is my closure. 

Thanks for all of the fantastic advice and most of you were spot on. She was extremely regretful but she was getting sick, you know the drill. This has been an very, beautiful, fucked up, educational and interesting journey and I don't regret meeting her or anything in between.* 

**I love you ~A~**

Hey guys and gals!  Warning, this is a long read. I'm sober, she's a heroin addict.

**TL;DR** This is going to be me rambling about an addict friend possibly stealing from me & my attempts at understanding her thought process and my desire to support her still.

A few months ago I crossed paths with the most beautiful person I've ever met and I don't just mean physically. Just a genuinely incredible person. She told me right out of the box that she was a heroin addict, but who am I to judge? She didn't use around me, and I didn't ask any questions except for those out of curiosity about the drug lifestyle. I've never been in to any drugs but I've tried a few things. Anyway, we had a blast together, and she could ask me for anything, and I'd help her if I could.

Things seemed great for almost two months. We didn't label our relationship, it was easy, and honest---so I thought. Last week the first unauthorized charges showed up on a credit card of mine after she had left my house, but it could have been my fault so I wasn't sure, but I had a gut feeling. Then today, after she leaves, Chase alerts me to some strange charges an hour later. One charge was in my town down the road, the second charge was at the same place the charges from the first card took place in the city south of me. I had used this second card for an online purchase earlier in the day, so I know I physically had it then. Anyway, she won't answer my calls or texts now.

If she's really the person I know, and she was just desperate, or not thinking straight, I can relate. I mean, she didn't clean me out, just $20 here, $40 there, I don't pretend to understand the mind of an addict though. She's probably been using for six years or so. I realize this is her world, her normal. I know she's stolen from her parents and they are estranged. I guess I just thought I was the exception. No, actually, I never even thought that something could happen like this. If she did do this, I'm just trying to understand it. 

Anyway, have you ever jumped through elaborate hoops to secure less than a hundred dollars from somebody by stealing it after months of set up? I've never let her down whether she needed a car battery, or some cash. I realized I was probably enabling her, but I kept my nose out of things, we were cool together. She could never hold it together for more than a day though now that I think back. If she stayed over for the night, the next day she'd have to leave for a little bit and then she'd come back, or meet me someplace. She usually told me she forgot her meds (suboxone) and needed to get that. 

I guess my question is, do you think there is any hope of salvaging our friendship, or can I just assume that I can never trust her again? I don't want to alienate her, I want to support her, she's a human fucking being for fuck sake! She's ill, I realize how nasty heroin is but her only friends are either current or ex junkies. I'm pretty lame by those standards. I wanted to give her some stability if she needed some time off from her crazy life, but I feel kind of fucked over now.

What's the best case scenario here? Keep her at arms length, but still be there? Ugh, I've no clue. I try to see the best in people. I know she's lost and doesn't know what to do with her life, but holy hell, I don't want to give up on her!

Thanks for listening, I needed to get that out.

I never give my money up and make sure the person has what I want before I hand anything over. The person that robbed me was one person out of maybe 2 that I trusted with my money. 
My DOC is the moons and that is all that is around where I live. So now there are fake ones floating around that scares me. I haven't started or ever done H due to the fact that I always know what I am getting with pain pills and don't have to worry with how strong or what it's cut with. This is such bullshit..
I am an addict I have no job and the money I get for my dope is always from hustling all day to get it. I understand people get sick but god damn people. I have done my fair share of shitty shit to get money but I've never robbed anybody. That's one thing I will never fuck with is an addicts sickness. If I come up with money to cop me something and then it gets taken from me I'm fucked. I don't understand how people can do this.

From my research I believe
5ml 
-10mg hydrocodone
-8mg chlorpheniramine

Diphenhydramine (benedryl) seems to be the antihistimine I would use to replace chlorpheniramine.

Do guys' you have any data or experiences about the interaction between hydrocodone and antihistamines?

I ended up saving it and still live there today plus I've been on time with all of my payments since! Anyways, my original mortgage lender was Bank of America. They were sued last year by the federal government for ""deficient mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes."" 

I heard about this on the radio at the time and my ears perked up when they said BoA was going to pay  2 Billion or some shit into a fund that the government would dole out to shafted BoA customers. The amounts would be based on where in the foreclosure process you ended up at. 

Cut to this week with me being poor and leaving tomorrow to spend Thanksgiving with my out of state family. I have enough dope to at least arrive high, but that's it. It's too late to bail on my trip, but there is no way I can get out of this anyways. 

I just checked the mail from YESTERDAY and there is a check from the Foreclosure review board that I have long since forgotten about. I only got $300 and that is probably because I kept my house. I'm sure you can imagine the overwhelming sense of relief I felt once I read it all over. Now I can score again before I leave and even have enough to leave my girl with something too. 

So this year for Thanksgiving I'm thankful for Bank of America being such assholes and fucking up so bad I just got paid because I didn't make any house payments for a year. The big junkie pilgrims in the sky were looking out for me this year. Thanks, Obama.

I'm paying for my slip up bog time. :/,"Okay, so I'm going to preface this by saying I'm normally extremely cautious with my usage. Unfortunately,  this time I slipped up and got myself in trouble.







I got out of rehab on the 13th and got high right out of the gate. I have used three times since then with no problems or anyone being suspicious. Today I was on my way out the door to go get high and had put a fresh rig, a tie and a spoon and left it on my computer desk before I ran outside to take a call.







Wellll, my mom apparently misplaced her lighter and went looking for mine. Instead of checking the desk where it was, she dug through my purse and found all my shit. She asked to piss test me and grabbed a home testing kit she had. I told her I didn't need to piss and told her I'd test when I for home, that a few hours wouldn't make a difference.  I also told her that I was clean ans hadn't used since before rehab when I actually had just done a cotton last night. I have opiates ib my system already so I went ahead with my original plan that I had with my buddy ans have so far eaten 120mg OPs and slammed 90mg of. Roxies.






My mom is going to kick me out. She graciously gave me the choice of getting dropped off in a shelter in either San Diego or the desert area (Palm Springs and surrounding areas). I would choose the desert because that is one of my old stomping grounds. The dope is phenomenal and cheap (3g's for $100) and the homeless population is a majority young people. I can also hustle up $350 and rent a room at a buddy's place. I have a few options that I can look at but I have to figure it out soon.






Just had to put it out there. That's where my life is at the moment. I've been off and on homeless for the better part of 5 years and I'm back on the road again.",1385428354.0

Firstly, I am told I shouldn't as it is dangerous. Many of here injecting BTH (black TAR heroin, the clue that it is probably not very nice is in the name) or street heroin. Both of these have many times the magnitude of risk as injecting a small amount of alcohol. This should be patently obvious.

Secondly, I bought the etizolam as a powder, so there's no fillers.

Thirdly, I'm going to do it again anyway, and I'm looking for harm reduction advice, not condescending haughty replies.

Just want to rant I guess....","So.... 18 year old heroin addict here. Just mostly want to write this out and figure out where my heads at right now, I'm confused as fuck

Went to a rehab this summer. Met this amazing girl, also H addict. Went to halfway houses afterwards for 3 months and chilled the whole time. We both move out into our own places.

 A few weeks ago I decided to start smoking weed again.  I just stayed high on weed until a few nights ago and I went to a rave with her, I didn't hit her up for a couple weeks before that because I was stoned the whole time and didnt want her to know.

So at this point we're headed to the rave, and she accuses me of being high  -because she knew that I was letting my friend crash at my apartment because he relapsed and got kicked out of his halfway house. I angrily deny the accusations thinking I might have fucked something up between us, because up until that point we had both  been encouraging eachother to stay sober and go to meetings and shit....

Well.... We go to someone's house before the rave to get tickets and there are people drinking and smoking weed and a couple people on Molly. She says shed be down to do Molly or acid. I like kind of give her shit but also kind of agree that I'd be down- because I don't want her to know I've already been getting high and I didn't know if she was serious.

We get there and it's pretty crazy. We both go looking around for Molly. and just being there in the first place is really weird after being in a completely recovery based community for 6 months. It was kinda surreal that we were even looking for it because we had always wanted the other to stay sober. We give up and have a couple beers we stole and then just dance for a few hours and throw down. I ended up getting really sick and we had to leave because I was dehydrated and hadn't eaten. So I felt kinda bad about leaving at about 1 because she had bought me the ticket for 30$. 

Even though I'm in Texas it's been snowing here, so we get to her car and there's a bunch of snow and ice on the roads. She takes me to her house and says she doesn't want to take me home because its dangerous to drive. Cool. So we layed in her bed and messed around a little bit, before that I'd only kissed her and I felt like I was gonna get friendzoned, but it was good and we cuddled all night and shit.

We awoke yesterday morning about 9 both feeling a little rough just from the previous night, and our ears were ringing so we had to yell at eachother, haha. I don't really remember how the conversation went but she remembered that she was on vivitrol and she shouldn't have Dranken last night, she didnt drink much at all though so its whatever.
 I tell her I've been smoking weed and ask if she wants to, and she says she's not a huge fan of weed. I tell her I can get pretty much anything but heroin in this town which blows her mind. Only opiates I could find we're morphines for way too much.

 So even though there was about 4 inches of snow on the ground we decided to head out and take a 6 hour road trip to where she's from and to cop a gram of tar. The drive should have gone in 4 hours but the roads were bad so the first half we were going like 30, and the second we were flying at like 110.

She says she had planned to go yesterday for a few days now, but she regrets telling me. She keeps like ""making sure I want to do this"" and I am positive, I try to make sure she wants to too. She had already relapsed since we went to treatment (and OD'd) and had about 3 months sober maybe?

We left from Texas at about 11 and arrived at 5. Went to her dealers, walk in, walk out, off to Walgreens to get some spikes. Usually this state is pretty strict on selling spikes without a reason, but I don't look like the junky I used to and I friendly and specifically asked for 30 gauge, 1cc short tips and got them. Word.  So we steal a bottle of water and go to her car to shoot up in the parking lot.

 We put probably .1 in the spoon at first and split the shot, she doesn't feel anything because her vivitrol, but her eyes are pinned as fuck. For some reason I didn't get much of a rush but I felt it In my head a little bit and I was dissappointed, I thought I had just built it up in my head to be better than it was. She throws another .2 in the spoon and we split the 40 unit shot again. I try for a vein on my hand for some reason and miss, im out of practice. Fuck. She is okay but isn't high, but she has gotten real quiet and looks like she feels it a bit. Her vivitrol was almost due for another shot so she thought it would have worn off.

We start heading back to Texas both a little disappointed and she's really worried because she has to get gas with her card and doesn't know if her dad will see that she's not in Texas. I start nodding hard as fuck. My heads on her glove box and my pupils are microscopic. We drove 6 hours and spent a total of 1 hour there. The drive back was quiet.

We get back to Texas and she's dropping me off at my apartment, and I ask for another shot because I had missed the last one. (She bought everything cause I'm broke, rave ticket, gas, dope, etc). We have like .5 left. She doesn't answer me and I can tell its obviously a no. But I don't want her to go do the rest by herself to try to feel something, so I end up kinda being a dick before I leave, and then she just barely pecks me when I kiss her goodbye....

 So I got home last night, the friend that I let crash here smoked all my weed and bounced to his hometown. I wasn't pissed but I was a little bummed out because I was looking forward to a bowl. I'm out of ciggs too so I scrap up 5$ in nickels and dimes and walk a mile in the snow to walmart.

Woke up this morning and I have no fucking clue where my heads at right now...... Typing that out (on my phone) helped me think a little straighter but I just have no clue what I'm doing.

Like last night when she dropped me off I was so fucking pissed she wouldn't give me that shot. And today I'm like fiending  but I'm broke and dont have a dope connect here.. I just don't really know what to do right now, it scared me how i reacted when she said no. I was loving weed until I did that dope, but now I feel like its just making me think slower and isn't worth the money. I want to do dope again bad but so much shit has worked out for me since I got clean that I just know I can't go back to that life even if I want to bad. It's like I really want to get high but I don't want to do any drug specifically.... I guess ill stay sober for a bit until I find a job....  And I have no idea if it'll be weird between me and this girl now.....

Oh well, I have no fucking clue what I'm doing anymore, ill let you guys know how it pans out.

I really care about this girl and I feel guilty, even though she's the one that took me and I had already relapsed.

TL;DR
Relapsed with my girl after almost 6 months sober, drove in snow for 6 hours. worried that using with her fucked something up with us.

EDIT: she also hasn't texted me back since last night and I'm really worried she slammed it all and OD'd because she couldn't feel it....

EDIT: friend who was crashing at my place sent me a text apologizing for smoking my weed, and told me to check my closet. Left me a big ass bottle of wine, huh....",1385399724.0

(Zoom in on the picture so you can read the dosage, etc...)

     Been on a two week long BTH binge, snorting it by cutting it with sleep aid. Around .2-.4 a day. Before this habit I've got going now, I was two weeks clean of dope, but on the two weekends I had taken a lot of hydros or percs. I finally had enough of the pills, and said fuck it and went and copped some tar after I got paid. Before those two sober weeks, I went through a 5 day cold turkey WD which was terrible because I had a habit of around the same I do now but it was for 1-3 months of using, the first two months weren't everyday, but the last month was, using multiple times a day. 

     Anyways, It's getting to that time of year where I've got money I need to save because Christmas is around the corner, my gf's birthday is in a month as well. And, I need the money for next semester's tuition. I just need the money for other things besides a dope habit that's leading me nowhere, but being broke and lying to everyone. Dunno if I'll pick it back up, but right now I know I don't want to. Tonight is the last time before I start tapering tomorrow. The taper will be 11 days and includes Oxycontin cut into 10mg chunks, A couple of Hydros broken into 5mg halfs. There's even one 2mg lope i through in there towards the end. Haha. Soma once there's no more opiate in me, and of course 1mg Kpins(prescribed), but no dope.

    TL;DR: Take a gander at the picture, how's my taper look? Any suggestions? Happy nods to everyone! Thanks!",1385508356.0

I for one am working until 7pm. What little is left of family are out of town and my brother will be at his girlfriends. So, after I get off work, I'm coming home and probably cooking a pizza. I might play some games and am hoping to score a 30. If I'm lucky I'm hoping this girl I'm really into will be able to come over and spend some time with me. If she does I'm gonna give her half of my 30. I won't be getting fucked up cause I have a tolerance from many years of dabbling but it will def get her good. On the bright side a half of one will take my knee and back pains away. Anyways...there's a chance I'll be spending tonight alone (and that's ok). I hope you all aren't in the same boat as me.

Update: Got home after dealing with the animals who come to do their weekly shopping 15 minutes before my store closes.

Im in no way an expert and im sure people here have a lot more experience than me but that being said i know enough to comment on this.

Ive kicked countless times from all types of habits whether it was a 2 week roxy binge to a year long 2 bun a day dope binge and used every method from lope to subs to cold turkey.

But when i kicked lesser habits yea it was uncomfortable but nothing worse than a bad cold. I know so many people that act like the world is ending when i can almost say for a fact are not in w/d. Its mostly people in real life but i see it on here once in awhile too. Even with a bad habit id usually start feeling it 12 hours after my last shot and id start getting pretty sick between 18-24 hours but by 24 i was SICK. But that was only with a bad habit. Im so sick of seeing people with a 2 bag a day or a 30mg a day roxy habit whining that there ""sooo sick"" at 8pm when they did there massive 30mg dose at noon. I used to hear it almost daily. ""I cant even get out bed"" ""i feel like death why wont he hurry!"" ALL of these complaints being much less than 24 hours since the last use if not 12 hours. Im sure some of them feel shitty 12+ hours in but how bad could you seriously feel when it hasnt even hit 18 hours. ESPECIALLY with such a small habit that wouldnt even warrant suboxone.

Basically smoke shop style drug stores, where you could just buy some LSD, some ecstasy, DMT, or anything else you're looking for.  

But look at how slow marijuana legalization is progressing.  It's a good ten to twenty years until pot users are no longer discriminated against.  If that.  In California they've already decided that medical marijuana is not an excuse for providing pre-employment drug screening samples containing cannabis metabolites.  Drug users will likely always be second class citizens in this country.  

The amount of ignorance we're privy to as users of the most stigmatized drug in contemporary society gives us a unique insight into this country's drug policies.  Do you guys think there's any hope of being able to buy this stuff from a store, instead of fuckin' shuffling around the law every time we need to cop?

Will society ever realize that if Heroin users have access to the drug, they'll be less likely to destroy their lived than they will when they have to associate with criminals to get their fix?

Step one is find a good source of unwashed seeds. Ask around for recommendations on here, but I recommend [*redacted after reading shocking amazon reviews on various sources. What the actual fuck is wrong with people?*].  Google for it, pretty easy to find. You want **unwashed** seeds. 

From there, the recipes vary wildly, as do methods. I purchased a 2L plastic container from the grocery, with a much wider mouth than a 2L soda bottle. I tried one of those the first time, and I hated it. I bought a metal strainer small enough to prevent seeds from passing. And a funnel. 

I don't have a kitchen scale, so I measure seeds by volume rather than weight. I did washes ranging from 3 cups to 4.5 cups of seeds. My first attempt was 3 cups of seeds rinsed with 32oz of cold water, shake for 5 minutes. Later on I started moving to two washes, the first one being 32oz, the second being either 32 or 40. Again, 5 minute shakes. I've had many threads say you get what you're gonna get after 5 minutes. Is it true? I dunno, not sure there's a way to know for sure, without consistency between batches and serious chemical testing. 

So my observations, and my thoughts after it all? I never got high. I got a head change, sometimes maybe what I'd almost call a light rush, and I was definitely not exactly sober for the rest of the night (these were all done after work in the evening). I had the pleasant feelings, relaxed, good mood, mellow, etc - but without a distinct high. Oh, and I'd also lose sleep over it, the same way I'd have trouble sleeping after taking some pills. Some pupil pinning too.  

The main benefit for me actually came the *next* day. Even after the loss of sleep, after I got up and moving, I would be in a good mood. Moving on into the morning, my mood would often keep moving upwards until it became borderline euphoric. Sometimes not so borderline, sometimes I'd actually get little euphoric rushes in the mid-morning - still not a high, but holy shit it made my morning at work better :D that never lasted past early afternoon at the latest, and then I would come back down to ""normal"".

Lessons learned. My last batch was the best. Didn't measure it, was the last of the bag, but it was right in the same general range. I used much less water though. Didn't measure, but didn't do that ""inch above the seeds"" thing every other guide suggests. I did it so it barely covered the seeds at all, maybe not even so much for the seeds to be able to float in it. I was trying to make it more concentrated, and I succeeded. The resulting liquid wasn't nearly as clear, was much thicker and clouded. I did two washes like that, probably could have done three, maybe even four. What I lost in liquid volume was made up in strength. I could tell a difference when I downed a tall glass and a half - even though still no real high. This morning, preparing for some impending social anxiety, I drank another half a small glass. Bout a half hour later, I'm gonna tell ya... I was actually a bit lit up! Caught me off guard, at the table during thanksgiving >.< still not like dope or good pills, but goddamnit, I was a bit high!! I chalk it up to the extra strength plus the usual morning after euphoria plus the extra morning drink.

Okay, details I've forgotten in this rambling narrative:

Lemon juice! Does it matter? Dunno. Doesn't hurt though. I just got the bottle of concentrated stuff, eyeball dumped a bunch. I hear grapefruit juice is better.

Should not be *white* cloudy. The only time I saw this was when I washed the seeds, then let them sit overnight and tried to wash them the next day. Don't do this. Mine was *yellow*, maybe tinged with brown. 

I used a metal strainer because cheesecloth or tshirt straining results in a lot of absorption. My trade off is that I know I don't get all the liquid possible out of the seeds, but that's a loss I accept. I believe it to be negligible. If you want the best of both worlds, I recommend a metal strainer first, until the liquid doesn't flow freely or visibly anymore, THEN use a cheesecloth/tshirt method.

Never soak the seeds, you're not accomplishing anything that way. See notes on cloudy white colour. 

I think that storing and refrigerating it makes it more potent. No, I have no objective proof of this. But when I was making those larger batches, I would drink a couple tall glasses (or so hehe) at night and get whatever effect. Next night, come home and stir it around (it settles) and throw more lemon juice in it, and drink a couple tall glasses... and I *swear* the effect was more pronounced. Something I intend to investigate further whenever I get around to getting more seeds.

Welch's Peach Mango juice. A very little bit of this to top off a glass of PST will knock down the godawful taste, without being overpowering. And seriously, you need like a splash, so it won't dilute the drink down. You can still taste the PST a bit, but it blends well with the juice and doesn't taste like ass, at all. 

If I remember anything else later, I'll edit this post. Questions or suggestions in comments always welcome, of course. Good luck and happy buzzing.",1385737401.0

1ror50,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ror50/how_insane_is_my_suboxone_doctor/,14,https://redd.it/1ror50,weighmore,How insane is my Suboxone doctor?,"I'll preface this by saying that I don't go to a 'cash only' jenk ass place where they're essentially just selling subs. This place is pretty recognized around here as being professional, and my doc is a GP specializing in adolescent medication, but also prescribes Suboxone (obviously for the cash). 

So I recently moved back to my hometown and had to continue my sub treatment, so finding a local doctor was an obstacle when I need to use insurance. Luckily, I found this place and made my appointment.

I'm now 11 months clean from opiates, zero relapses, but have been on 2-4mg of Suboxone (scripted 8mg) for all but the first three days of withdrawal. I've also been on Klonopin (1mg daily) for the better part of 5 years for GAD and Panic Disorder.

I started seeing this doc a few months ago, and on the first visit, I was just fucking hoping to god that he would allow me to continue my much needed Klonopin along with not rushing me off subs. I got what I wanted and more. As I was going through my medical history, I mentioned casually that I was diagnosed with ADHD a year or two ago, but wasn't medicated for it. He immediately asked me why I wasn't medicated, and I just said 'I don't know...never really thought about it after the Wellbutrin made me feel insane.' That was the truth. I had no plans to scheme any ADD meds or anything like that. Just wanted a local doc.

So he says that he's gonna start me on 30mg of Vyvanse (lol). I thought, sweet. I'll take 2 a couple days a week and that'll be that. I came back a week later, said it wasn't doing a single thing (it wasn't), and he upped me to 50mg. 

I stayed on 50mg for another two months, then started to be able to struggle to afford it. With insurance, Vyvanse is still damn expensive. It works nicely, is super helpful, but hardly worth 80$ a month. Went back in for my next appointment, and he said we'd just switch over to Adderall since it has a generic. I was happy about that, but then I couldn't believe it when he said we'd do 25mg XR *twice* daily. 50mg of Adderall daily is totally unnecessary for me, but whatever, I figured I'd have extras just in case. I take it maybe 3-4 times per week max. Don't see any addiction potential for me personally, but it's obviously there.

So this last visit, I went in and told him about the panic attacks I've been having lately, despite my Klonopin script. I'm completely dependent on the Klonopin obviously, so it doesn't really do a whole lot in the event of a panic attack. I take it as prescribed, so I can't afford to spare a pill when shit goes wrong. I used to get Xanax in a 5-10 pill script PRN back in the day, so I asked my clearly fairly liberal doctor if he'd be willing to write me said small prescription. I've had issues with abusing Xanax when I was younger and a bit naive, so I didn't want to get a full bottle because I don't know that I fully trust myself with it. I have zero issues abusing Klonopin. Never have, never will. Too afraid of running out early. I also didn't want to increase my Klonopin dosage because I'd just end up where I'm at right now inevitably. A small script just seemed like the smartest/safest/most ideal option.

He went on to say that Xanax and Klonopin are the exact same drug 'because they're from the same family, and both last 8 hours'. I didn't want to appear like a drug-nerd, but I wanted to inform him of how incorrect he is. Xanax has a half-life of 11ish hours, whereas Klonopin is in the ballpark of 30-40ish hours. Huge difference in effects as well. For him to call them the same is unbelievable. 

He was extremely friendly and casual about the whole ordeal, and just said that he couldn't prescribe both because 'doctors don't really ever do that'. Also complete bullshit. I've had them both written to me personally, and I read about it all the time. So he said that I could choose to stay on the Klonopin or try out Xanax with an added .5mg if I felt I needed to take it. It was too hard to not accept the 90 .5mg Xanax vs. 60 .5mg Klonopin without giving it a shot. 

I want to remind everyone again, this is a doctor who treats self-admitted drug addicted patients. I can't see any straight doctor who prescribes Suboxone in their right mind prescribing a former addict both Xanax and Adderall with hardly any effort. No matter how long they've been clean, I'd expect some serious skepticism. There has been zero from this guy. 

I have a hard time calling this guy out for a number of reasons, that I'm sure don't even need to be stated. But one, I am worried about my sobriety, and I don't want Xanax to fuck it up. Benzo addiction is the fucking worst, and I've been there, done that in my younger years. I don't think that would've happened if I discovered it at an older age. I've taken Xanax several times recreationally since my 'issue', but never had any problems as I'm already dependent on Klonopin, for better or worse. I 'partied' the first few nights with my new script, but I'm going to see how it works when taken as prescribed. I can afford to run out early this month because of leftover Klonopin. Just don't want to raise my tolerance too much. I haven't gone too crazy or anything. Just around 3mg compared to the 1.5mg for a few nights.

Another reason is that it's sort of nice to be able to essentially choose what medications you want. I tell him what works for me, and he seems to have enough trust in me to prescribe it. Self-medicating legally, I suppose. It's much better than being given 10 different SSRIs that don't do a damn thing and being judged for even suggesting a benzo, I'll say that much.

So what do you guys think about this? Is this doctor fucking insane, an idiot, just extremely liberal and/or trusting in his patients, or a combo? I'm comfortable on my meds as of now, but I plan to switch back to Klonopin if the Xanax can't be taken in the same manner. The guy gave me 3 refills too.

Is there any way I could make use of this without shooting/ smoking?,"In the past, I've found that smoking it is just a waste and not how I want to spend my heroin. (And I'm definitely against shooting, don't try to change my mind. I've been around this sub for a long time now, and I'm well past the social stigma that is accompanied with H and everything; It's just something I'm not down for, so move on).

I've tried dissolving the tar into some water and putting that into a nasal spray bottle so I can ""snort"" it, and while it works better than smoking, it's still weak and not what I'm looking for. 

I've also tried (and failed) to turn the tar into a snortable powder, so that may still be a viable option, but I'm weary about that as well. 

I've plugged it once and felt next to nothing, but I'm not so positive if my bowels were completely excreted. Would  plugging be the way to go for me? 


Anyway, what I'm looking for is; is there anyway I could either develop the tar into some substrate that I could take orally that would be equally as effective? 

Basically I'm just looking for some way to make tar either (1) very easily accessible, such as for insufflation or (2) some form of accessibility such as oral so that the high lasts for a much longer time.

Im a long time lurker, first time poster (seriously, ive never been a poster before... now im hangin on some horse fuckers wall with tape all over my back)...... JUST KIDDING.. im not really a poster.. im a people)

Soooooo... anyways. Ive noticed a lot of posts asking the same question. How can i continue enjoying my favorite drug but not feel the excruciating pain of physical withdrawal. I spiced that sentence up a tad, usually the question is more like ""HERPS DERGUS! HOW CAN I BANG HEROIN AND OXYS AND DILLIES AND PST BUT NEVER BE ADDICTED"". I dressed it up a little. Well if your anything like me youve probably wondered the same thing. Here are the rules I like to live by and so far they have been working. 

I want to preface this by saying Im mostly focusing on preventing physical withdrawal. the psychological aspect of that is a whole other ball game. Also i know people are gonna be all ""DERR DERRR DERR YOUR ALREADY ADDICTED COCKSMITH"". Ya.. ok.. I get it... But I said it first so no need for u to chime in. Thanks. Also these rules assume that your use isnt already a daily habbit. Also i know everyone is different and yadda yadda but this is what has worked for me... so far

Rule #1: NEVER use for more than 3 days in a row. And if anything try to keep it to 1-2 days. that way your body doesn't have enough time to readjust the levels of neurotransmitters and hormones, in an attempt to maintain homeostasis. Sure youl still feel kinda edgy once you run out, but it wont be nearly as bad and usually only lasts till the next day if anything. You should still be able to sleep and eat without too much discomfort. And those are the most important things to repair, heal and avoid withdrawl.

Rule #2: Smoke Lots of weed. This is pretty much on every list of rules i have.... 

Rule #3: Space the time between sessions by at very least a week. Preferably 2 weeks. This gives your body time to heal and return to a normal state. Ive noticed that even if i dont feel anything physical there is still a general malaise hangin around. If you give in and use again before the week is up, that general sadness is going to come back much stronger for much longer. A quick rule of thumb I like to use is that I dont cop until the track marks from last time have completely healed.


And thats it. Three simple rules that have kept me from having to endure the week long hell hole that is physical withdrawl from opiates. And trust me i know a thing or two about that. Oh ya and if you do find yourself trapped in a situation where your going to get sick heres some stuff ive used to ease the symptoms.

!. Cyclobenzaprine: its a skeletal muscle relaxant. Honestly its a wonder drug. Stops alot of aching and shaking, relaxes you a great deal and also lets you fall asleep. and im the type of person that has alot of trouble with any sleeping pill but this shit knocks me out cold son, No matter what ive injested. And its a deep sleep. Its great

2. Gaba-Pentin

3. Vallium/Xanax/Clonazepam/X-Benzo

4. Clonodine 

5. Mercindol: I live in Canada (FUCKIN EH) and you can get this behind the counter at most pharmacies. Its a codeine preparation with acetaminophen and a sleeping drug (something succinate, i forget) instead of diphenhydramine which i fucking hate cuz it never works and just makes me restless and unable to sleep. I used this to taper down the last time I kicked. Its magic.

Tl;DR: well fuck you then.. whyd you open it?

[PST],"So I've only ever gotten mild WD's before, and I don't have a lot of experience with WD's in general. So, bear with me if I sound kind of ignorant.

I get mild WD's really easily, after like 4-5 days of use, but they last only a day or so. I went on a tea binge for like 5 days because I had nothing else and cuz dumb, and I woke up yesterday with lots of shitty symptoms: muscle-aches, anxiety, flu-y symptoms, feeling like my skin is crawling, you know the drill. 

I took some more tea to make it go away because I didn't want to feel like shit on Thanksgiving. However, I've gotta do more holiday stuff this weekend and I really don't want to do it if I'm in WD mode. So, questions.

1) How long can I expect these WD's to last? Probably like a day or two right? That's how long they lasted before with oxy, but some people are telling me tea withdrawal is extra long/shitty for some reason.

2) If I delay WD by taking more opiates today, will that make my WD significantly worse/longer? 

I know these WD's are nothing compared to what some of you guys have been through, but still, I had a lot of family stuff planned and I don't want to fuck it up by feeling/looking like grumpy death. Thanks in advance, y'all are wonderful. ",1385749982.0

I will post all the games later tonight when I get home, but consists of a shit ton of keys from past humble bundles.

I tend to buy 2 of each bundle, one for me, the other as prizes for various sites I use.

This one is open to only /r/opaites.

Without checking, there are probably 30+ games. I will either give them all to one winner, or split them up into 3 prizes. Not decided yet.

The winner is free to do what they like with the keys. Keep them, give them away. Hell, you can even sell them if it floats your boat, the choice is yours.

In a few hours I will update this post with all the games.

So let's get the ball rolling. To enter and stand a chance of winning, post the reason you believe you should get them, and what you plan on doing with them.

I will get someone to help me pick the winner/winners so my choice is not biased.

Good luck, and let the free games roll.

Only reply to this thread. PM replies will not be accepted. If for whatever reason you are not happy making your reply public, pm me your reason and I will consider it, but do not promise it will be accepted.

EDIT

I have decided that yet again, they will all go to one person, and, I will NOT be posting how many games or their names.

There is over 30 I think, with most keys giving you more than one game.

They contain a whole range of games. From indie games to a few Top rated games.

The person who wins can then do what they want with them.

Right, I will let this run for about 24 hours from NOW 20:50 in the UK. Might be a bit longer, but no less.

Good luck to ya all

Edit 2: Comp will now run for another 12 hours +..... Left my laptop with all the codes on at home. Sorry.",1385748354.0
