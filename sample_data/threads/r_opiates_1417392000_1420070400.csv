I'm sitting here having a pretty good day, I was able to score for two days earlier, and I've just been watching Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy.

I was thinking about good and bad people that I know in the game and was looking for stories from you guys about the best and worst people you've done drugs with. I love hearing other people's stories.

I'll start.

The worst person I've ever met didn't do anything to me directly, but he briefly had a girlfriend that he did heroin with. he got her to buy heroin with him FOUR TIMES and then he convinced her that if they got on methadone, they could be high all the time for way cheaper. Really he just wanted to get on methadone himself and still have her pay for it and still use heroin when he could. last I heard about them, she had been on the methadone for over a year with him and was still paying for both of theirs and they were doing heroin when they could too, basically to the point of homelessness. and that poor girl had a good job and a nice life.

I know a lot of good people that are also heroin addicts, but in my bias, my favorite is my boyfriend. I had another boyfriend when I mer my current one, and my current one let me and the old one stay at his old house for free. I ended up breaking up with the old one, and the new one still let me stay. would pay me in dope to drive his car to the city and spend his money on dope. always splits with me 50/50 even though it's his money. and just is all around a pretty solid guy, doesn't lie to people, would help anyone out if he could.

how about you guys? good/bad stories? happy nods everyone!",1417414669.0

I truly love that burst of blood entering the barrel,... there's something special about that sign that I'm in my circulatory system and I can now with the simple push of plunger have a powerful effect on my consciousness within mere seconds. I'm not a morbid person and I'm not into vampires and shit or goth-anything...but that little burst of blood is something I really, really love. I didn't expect it but after a few successful shots it just became this really cool visual that I look forward to. 

I used to read about how the needle itself becomes addictive, or how people romanticize the needle, and I read it but I really didn't get it, I get it now and that burst of blood is my favorite part aside from the drug itself. I also don't think I'll ever look at needles the same way again. 

And I'm so pleased with myself cause for the first time I was able to check that I'm in, remove the tourniquet, pull a little more blood out to make sure I'm still in and then push the plunger down.  now if I could just inject anywhere but the pit of my arm I'd be thrilled.

2nvad3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2nvad3/rules_for_cold_copping/,37,https://redd.it/2nvad3,ayron5150,Rules for cold copping,"After nearly 4 years of being right in the middle of one of the more well known open air markets in this country, I've had to set my own rules for when I cannot contact anybody, if I desire a specific pill that I know Ill find faster on the street than through a person, or even when I walk through the main strip which is almost a daily routine. I have had people walk off with money, snatch my dough and run, hand me fake dope, try to pass off pills that were not what I thought I was going to get, and routinely see it happen or hear about people getting beat, coming back from ""the block/ hill."" Because of these experiences, i always try to impart my knowledge on anybody hoping to score around here. A good first rule for any situation is not to let your money walk. Never. You will have stupidly trusted this stranger you met no more than 15 minutes ago that somehow 'knows you from somewhere' and 'has whatever you want.' After making sure they have you thinking that you are their best friend, after that other large shadowy figure on the corner who doesn't understand when eye contact should be used, of course, you will stand like an idiot wherever you were just told to, usually away from anybody that may actually have what you're looking for on hand, just to realize that this person who you just gave your last $20 to, and who you promised to treat right when you received your shit, is not ever coming back again. At least until they see that you've left the area for a little while. if you do see them again, and are stupid enough to even ask about where he went, you will be in the midst of another scam for you to again lose out on whatever money you are hoping to spend. Another rule is that if somebody has everything, they usually have nothing, and will walk that 10 feet further that you should have walked yourself, gotten the same thing that you would have gotten from the same dude you probably would have talked to, but there would be a piece missing, or instead would be instructed by several other people to pay the man what you owe him as a 'finders fee.' When you hear the posted up dealers listing what they have, it is not a guarantee, but is at least more assuring than listening to somebody claiming to have Walgreens in his pocket, despite that horrible odor coming from his crusty jacket and stained jeans with more crackpipe ash and street marks than their intended color. A good idea is to stick to buying from somebody who looks like they might have a roof over their head at night, has some meat on their bones as if they eat daily, and if you see someone who you recognize if you've already bought from them in the past and weren't completely unsatisfied. If you make the mistake of not tipping after having a service rendered to you that you easily could have done yourself, and in fact even insisted that you do it yourself to no avail, you might have some problems at that moment or you might just have to wait until you are spotted by the same person and verbally harassed. Do not pull out money; have everything ready in your pockets and only bring out money that you want to spend. Pulling out bills not only looks bad in terms of law enforcement, but looks very appealing in terms of many crackheads who know you have no choice but to accept having your money snatched, unless you like unnecessary conflict. Don't tell just tell everyone and anyone what you want. If you don't hear it being called within the first walk around the block, quietly ask those who look like they shouldn't have to resort to robbing you for a few bucks. Everyone out there is on the same team, even if they hate each other, and that is whatever team you are not apart of. When you let the entire block hear your order, you allow yourself to more easily being set up with fake pills/ drugs or pills that resemble what you wanted, but on closer inspection turn out to be flexeril (if you're lucky you'll get flexeril instead of something totally inert). Don't seem overly happy or friendly. Kindness is considered weakness in these peoples eyes, and your generosity might just land you involuntarily shoeless and without a phone... Don't buy street dope over here is another rule that i will always stick by unless given something as a gift from somebody who hasn't yet gotten it in their heads that their money is important along with their health and that even though most things being injected into your bloodstream outside of a hospital are probably not the most sterile or pure, leaving you with a much higher risk of abscess and infection, and the persisting image of the black sludge you just strenuously pushed out of the syringe into your body. No amount of boiling makes that appealing to me!!  SO, I hope that this is not already a thread and that Ive brought up ideas that others can relate to, and would love to hear how your local dope corner is and if you need to employ the same tactics when copping. Also, are there any rules that I should add? They might be common sense, but even that takes getting used to when you're placed in such a different environment to what you and I would rather have, assuming you do not thrive on others misery and are not out to play everyone with whom you come into contact... I guess feel free to also hit me up with any questions. Thanks and hope my first post was sufficient for this awesome forum",1417377629.0

I had the day to myself and lacking the paticance to wait for tomorrows DNM  deliveries (including dicanol :-D) I thought fuck it. 
 
Went out with £20 and got talking to two homeless guys by starting to offer them a smoke. Got chatting and noticed they were both pinned to fuck. I straight up asked them to score - get 3 bags for £20 keep one and give me two. So he phones his guy, puts an order in for 3 and 1. Got their life story a bit, their numbers and then their dealer rings. So I say, look I'm not letting my money walk. He says then your not getting any gear...

So i ask for his bag and phone as collateral and that one stays with me. Only £20 and my gut instinct told me they were safe. 2 mins later he's back and hands me 2 cling film wraps.they then ask if I wanna shot with them. This was a bigger risk than letting the money walk but i had an hour to kill and thought fuck it.

So we all got settled in a good spot, everyone their own clear gear. I did a bag and offered to top theirs up a little with my 2nd bag for a hit of crack.

We than sat and chat shit, they were buzzing about me getting dicanols. Been old timers they confirmed a dicanol speed ball is the greatest rush :) one showed me a couple of really easy to hit veins in my legs, near the knee. Great for rotation. So I now have these guys who's spot is round the corner from my office, this unreliable delivery guy I spoke about yesterday and DNMs.

I still take one hits of dope here and there and still snort some monkey water but with how efficient iv use is I just can't imagine using even small chunks of dope for smoking. such a small amount of dope can yield a fairly nice mix for a half cc syringe that I think I'll be taking one hits now and then and that's about it for the most part.

I can't wait to get my tax return so I can sample some cheaper dope from around the world. the stuff my dealer has right now is so, so fucking good but it's too expensive. 

the cost is one of the biggest factors in my desire to take a break from dope, i really want to reset my tolerance. 

I wish i could ask how long it would take to get back to zero tolerance but i don't think i will and i know there are just too many factors for me to ask you guys without getting tons of information on my use, it would end up being a stupid question so as always I'll just wing it based on how i feel and take little doses of codeine accordingly. 

I am determined to only use at night for the next week and to only shoot up 1 cc a night, whether that's 2 half ccs or one full cc, and I'm shooting for roughly the same potency every time. 

I know it's time for a break, but these guys just had to get a new batch that's so.damn.good. oh well, still time for a break and i know this deep down. ",1417500374.0

(this happens to me literally everywhere in the city except my block where everyone knows me and mine) i let it happen though cause i dont want to start shit.just the way it is round here. anyways i finally make it to the front of the line, and what do you know , i swipe the card, declined. i try again, declined. i pull out my four dollars in cash and i explain to the man i dont have enough and maybe he could just give me four singles... but no. they dont do that anymore. and i hear a voice of an angel behind me ""i got a dollar for her."" this nice black woman standing next to me in the other line overheard my problem and handed the pharmacist that last grace dollar i needed. i thanked her perfusely and told her i would surely pay it forward, so grateful for her random act of kindness. but what really made me happy was that in this city which is so commonly known for its harsh racial tensions, which for my whole life i NEVER understood and REFUSE to abide to, I was so grateful that not only did she save me from having to use a dirty needle again today, she saw past all the issues that blacks and whites have been having in this town for the last century. if more people in this city could just lay down their arms (hah) and get to know one another, it could be a better and happier place to live for all of us.

His skin was smooth and his hair was dark and thick. He had brown eyes that imprisoned deep secrets that he would share with no one. His gaze enthralled me, I needed to know everything about him.

He was funny, silly, confident and arrogant, but he was mostly charming. First, we would call each other endlessly. Then, I spent as much time as I could by his side. Now I live with him. I fell in love with this man. I love him and he loves me.

There is a force severing our love and withering our lives. This force is evil but alluring. When he comes in contact with it all his troubles drift away and all he feels is content. But this force does not live in reality, it only directly effects those that choose it. His mind is numbed and his limbs grow heavy. He breathes slower and slower, so slow that I am unsure at times if he is still there. 

	The force is everything he thinks about when he does not have it. Life is not worth living without the force. Where can he get it? When will he get it? What is the Price? The force has drained his pockets and his mind. The force persuades him to steal and lie. The force must be obtained at all costs. 

	Please evil force spare my love. He is everything to me. He is the one that makes me laugh when I cry. He is the one that holds me tight and tells me everything is going to be ok. He makes this shy scared girl into a confident woman. Please force, let go of my man so I might have him back.

The past couple weeks, for example, I've probably used PST on average every other day. And PST, as PST users know, tends to have a lingering effect even on the day after you use it. So essentially, I've been constantly feeling the effect of PST for the past couple weeks or more (even though it's been minor on the day after). 

Anyways, with that preface out of the way, I decided to stop using PST for a week or so to get my tolerance back down (it wasn't getting too high, but it was slowly creeping up) and because my 25 pound bag of poppy seeds is nearly at its end. Every time I do this, I realize how much I rely on opiates to keep me mentally balanced. I suffer from mild to moderate depression and maybe a tiny bit of anxiety. Whenever I'm on opiates, it doesn't necessarily make me happy, but I never go into any deep depressions. I just feel normal and it's great. And then I stop using opiates and I remember that I suffer from depression and it's a struggle to get through the day without feeling miserable about my life at the end of the day (on a related note, when I'm not using opiates, I drink WAY more alcohol. In the past couple weeks when I've been consistently using opiates, I didn't want a drink even once, but the first day that I'm totally clean, I needed a drink pretty badly). It's not even as if I've just become dependent on opiates to give me that boost and when I'm not on them I become depressed. In the past two years, I think I've had two six-month periods where I didn't do any opiates at all and I still felt the exact same way.

I have 3 herniated discs (L5-7) spinal stenosis, and if that wasn't enough, arthritis in the ole spine as well. Been in a good amt of pain since my initial injury in 2011. Took abt 6 mos to get diagnosed, and a dear friend taught me the in's & out's of PST for the pain until I got the right MRIs & found a pain mgmt doc who would see me. 

At first I sipped PST every 3 days or so, at a dose of ~1lb of the right black magic dots. Doc put me on hydro 5mg/750apap 3x per day & flexiril 10 mg 3x/day after I made it thru a consult appt w only maryjane in my system (also helps w the pain & my doc didnt care about greenery at first), as I had no PST in my system, to pee in the cup properly. I've had nerve blocks & epidurals ~every 4 mos, which used to really cut the pain, and I still had hydros left each month as I using PST when the pain was at worst, and doc never made me test again. (I know!)

Fast forward to last December, when here on this side of the country we had an ice storm every other day, and I fell on ice, landing on my ass, making a bad spine exponentially worse. Pain Mgmt doc says my spine is unstable, but since I'm only 42, didnt want to greatly increase my mg's, but I got 7.5mg/325apap, 3x per day, flexaril up to 4x per day. I still had the PST, so I didn't care. Got me on gabapentin, titrated me up to 600mg 3x day, which helped with all the new pinched nerves. Nerve blocks now only last ~two months. I am a poor surgical candidate due to my age, and the arthritis will just shatter my vertebrae if we tried fusion, according to PM doc plus two ""second opinions"" for good measure. I was at the point where the pain was so bad that I started sipping the PST once per day, and used my hydros for breakthrough. I still had a few hydros by the end of the month.

I told my PM doc I was still in a lot of pain, he agreed, as he said my heart & blood pressure spiked when I had to move around the procedure table when I had an epidural this January, so he moved me to 7.5mg/325s 4x per day, and the gaba & flex as well. 

In March, after another astounding snowfall, I fell, again on ice. I called my PM doc, he said to come right in that day, and as soon as I went to an exam, they asked for urine, which had my hydros, but also mary jane and the PST. The stick in the bottle said simply morph, codine & ""other,"" and the nurse told me they had to send it to the state anyway bc I hadnt been tested for so long, and asked what other ""things"" I'd been taking for so many other opiates to pop, but not the acetates from H. I told her about the PST, but she literally laughed in my face and told me they'd heard that one before, but I'd better come up with something better to tell my doc than that since PST ""isn't really a thing."" I was honest with my doc, who challenged me, but I told him I knew where to get optimal ingredients & was a ninja at the extraction. He googled it right in front of me, but wasn't satisfied with the results, and said he needed to do more research, but he could do nothing else for my pain, and gave me a month to get the maryjane outta my system. 

My regular appointment was about 2 weeks after, and I drank only PST until 4 days before my appointment, when I ate (more than the prescribed amount of) my hydros, and stopped smoking. Natch, more urine, but no long list of opiates this time. Got all my refills, and my doc said he believed me about the PST, but that I had to stop. 

The following month, I anticipated a pee, which happened, and while the WDs from the PST were hellish, I had my hydros, and needed a few to keep me from being obviously sick. Doc comes in, tells me he's sorry, but the state had forbade him from giving me the hydros, but he knew I was undermedicated (well fuckall dude, you undermedicated me, causing me to drink the PST, but he was great at epidurals, so I'd lived with it!) considering the shape my spine was in, so he gave me gaba, flex, and 4mg sub strips 3x per day, and told me to taper as this was it for opiates, but he would still see me since it would be cruel to abandon me utterly, but the subs would help the pain.

I tried the subs the next day, and I despised the speedy feeling & headache it gave me, and it didn't touch the pain. I realized I had 24hrs before I could sip the PST, and while I had no WDs, the pain was awful. No position was comfortable. I decided since I wasn't going to have to pee in a cup again, that I'd call up my guy & secure maryjane. I tucked the subs away in a drawer, sipped my tea, and puffed as needed. 

The following month, I go to my doc, more urine, which I refused to do bc I knew I wasn't getting opiates, but was told if I did not, then I couldnt undergo my epidural in 2 weeks. I reluctantly complied, and received a sound scolding from my doc, but that was about it. The day before my procedure, when I went to my usual spot for the essential PST ingredient, all out. The back-up spot was out, as was the back-up back-up. I had three doses left in my fridge anyway, and mail-ordered what turned out to be bunk--which I read was happening to my fellow PST-sipping fans. The Great Bunkening of 2014!

I was telling my woes to my mary jane guy my dilemma the day after my procedure (which utterly failed to bring relief for the first time) and he informs me his brother was a 10-yr H devotee, and said since I was the sort of person who didn't use up all my goodies at once anyway, it could be worth a shot. I first said absolutely not, since its so hard to predict cut, or worse, but after my two other mail-order attempts for PST failed, I called. Writhing in pain left me suicidal, and between dude's brother & youtube vids, I learned to shoot, because just because I have a vagina doesnt make me pussy, lol, and I despise leaving mg's (money) on the table. PM doc never found the H in my system, as I didn't get another procedure after the failed one, just refilled gaba & flex.

Three months & one abcess (my veins roll) later, I'm still only a toe's tip in compated to what else I saw. I usually bought a weeks worth at once, and dosed myself like it was ""prescribed,"" because the pain, oy the pain! (And while I hated opiates, at first, as my DOC since I was a teen was weed, after nausea had ceased to be a problem, well, what was not to love if I allowed myself a high about once per week) I was at about half a g per day, max, maybe a wee more if it was raining.

But, bad electrical burned my house down about two months ago, while I was out, and now I'm living under my parent's roof in a different state, which I haven't lived in for 18 years--zero connects. For anything. My insurer doesn't operate in this state, and I secured new health insurance before T-giving. I got subs from my H guy before I left, did a two-week taper down to 1mg subs/day. While I will be here for only about six months til my housing clarifies, I want to be clear of opiates to get my tolly down, pee normal for whatever PM doc I decide doesn't utterly suck, and my folks would def not be okay if I made PST, and they're both retired and tee-totalers, and rarely leave home. Its been two weeks since the last bit of sub, and while I had no acute WDs, (thank you gabapentin), I am certain I'm in PAWS. Full-on goosebumps about twice per hour, lotsa sneezing, and I've slept so little it is starting to wear me down. I'm past subs being detected, and I despise them anyway. 

Found a bottle of 37.5mg tramadol (22 pills) buried in an old drawer, and I know the SSRI/SNRI effects, but I've never had seizure issues. It is taking great effort to not eat four or so & try and sleep, but, am I fucking up that hard-won taper & merely prolonging PAWS? I keep thinking ""but I'm so tired I will surely sleep tonight,"" but no. OTC sleep aids did nothing, booze makes me vomit. I don't wanna eat up my precious gaba or I will have nothing between me and the wall of pain.

I won't kid myself--I know I will be back on opiates for my spine at some point in the (hopefully near) future. But I need to know if the trammy will help or prolong this ugggh. Thanks for reading & any help.

To start, I've been diagnosed with chronic pain for about 3 years now, been in pain for  about 4 to 5.  So far, no doctors have had luck diagnosing what has been the cause of my chronic pain. (for anyone interested, it's mainly my right shoulder in the joint/tissue. But the pain is sporadic and in many places. wrists, my other shoulder, hips, and knees.) Because of my age, 19, many doctors will not go and write me a script for something narcotic that will actually help me with the pain. I'm at a point where these ""flare ups"" I constantly have, affect me from sleeping at night, working, really any physical movement with an affected joint. Not to mention the stress it puts on me, and as a result my depression, bi/polar disorder takes a dramatic downward spike. fuck me, right? 
Well, as a result you can probably guess I have become very reliant on getting my opiates on the streets, and due to the fact I've moved to a Midwest state, prices are HIGH, veryy high. Like I'm talking $40 a pt. $20-$30 for a 30mg MS Contin, and that's all I can find.. 
So here's what I've been thinking... There is a well known suboxone doctor in town, and I believe they're accepting new patients. I think I would be able to get a script if I went in to my appointment and told her about my problem with heroin/opiates. My thinking is that subs will be better than nothing really, help me with pain, help me sleep. But I'm concerned that I will be forever looked down upon for drug abuse from future doctors, and that very well could prevent me from an opiate script once I'm older.. 
Has anyone had experience in a situation like this? Or has anybody used subs for pain management? Not really sure what to do anymore... when I do finally drink or dab myself to sleep I have dreams that I'm cutting off my arms, or that I'm trying to kill myself.. was very suicidal for the better half of the year, I've finally started to come around, but now that my pain is back, I don't want to slip down that slope again... pretty much just looking for any help... thanks everyone, happy nods

I recently lost the love of my life because I couldn't kick the habit. I tried over the span of 6 months to quit. I would get clean then after a few weeks get bored and go score some dillauds (25apiece) and bang them. Im 22 years old. Last year in college. This girl was incredible. I feel so stupid for losing her. She gave up on me, and she said once and addict always an addict. She said I want to be with you for the rest of my life but I know I can never be. She said even if your clean I know how easy it is for you to relapse.

Anyways so yea I got arrested in May. 2 felonies- principle to the sale of a controlled substance and possession of klonopin (1 fucking pill under my seat is all he found, didnt know it was there). so yea I just picked up 40 blues and 10 MS... My dealer asks me for a ride to a trap house. I take him there. But Im like yo just in case lets leave those pills at your house, i can get them when I get back.  So yea cops fucked me over that day. but i was blessed i didnt bring all those blues which I was getting for like 10 a piece.  7grand later I got the charges dropped to a misdemeanor called possession without prescription. 

I just banged a 8mg dilly fealing great. I just wanted to share to all you guys  a little bit of my life, kinda makes you feel better when other opiate lovers are out there and can relate.

my DOC is now dillaudids, (AINT NO BETTER RUSH and Please people do not snort or plug these beautiful things, there is a place inside me that is dying when I hear people doing that) There aint no good H down in westcoast,FL. But my addiction slowly started cause I had the best connect in the world for blues. Even when they were already 1$-mg I was getting them for .33$mg. 

If I knew what I was getting myself into when I first found that bottle of 5mg oxys at my house when I was 17, I would never touched those. Addiction is a slow process, before you know it the opiates grab ya!

I need to get clean. But the PAWS always gets me in the end. Anyone else hear can relate to my story? Any of you lose your soulmate because of our love of opiates?

These past 4 years in college have been the fucking best time of my life. I am so grateful for having such a good liberal arts college experience. I am a international bussiness and computer science double major. I got big aspirations in life. I just wish I could buy Opiates OTC. I have spent probably 20grand on oxy or dillys. Thats why I got to quit...

      That's when I start feeling it. Oh no this dope was too strong I'm gonna hurl. I ask the mothers receptionist where the bathroom was, she points me to it and I do my best to inconspicuously make my way to the bathroom as fast as I can. Get in and just start hurling, for a good ten minutes. I finally stop, okay i think, I can do this. I wash up and leave the building. I walk into this optometry place and the smell is so fucking weird, it's definitely not helping.
       The lady leads me into the room and shortly after the doctor comes in. She straps me into that fucking machine and starts going off. Which is better number 1.....number 2....which is better number 3.....number 4. Holy fuck i rip the thing off my face leap out the chair and just start vomiting into this poor doctors sink. She runs out and returns with a water bottle, I look up and just go ""this isn't a product of the exam"" take a swig of the water, get back into the chair and just pretended like it didn't even happen. She finishes as fast as she (and I can take) can.
  I confirm the prescription with the receptionist and just gtfo. Damn that was a rough day. ",1417653441.0

I consider myself fairly experienced with opiates (codeine, hydrocodone, oxy, dilaudid, oral (ugh) opana) but have and plan never to do heroin. I think I'm mostly against IV'ing unless in a hospital setting. I don't judge others for doing it, I just feel extremely uneasy about it and feel like it's fairly dangerous (just talking about IV'ing, not heroin itself).

Anyway, my QUESTION is: for those who use heroin and other opiates, is there any amount of any other opiate taken orally or intranasally at any dose that feels exactly like IV heroin minus the rush itself, or especially insufflated heroin? Are the drugs I mentioned like dilaudid and opana stronger than heroin when insufflated?

I'm quite impressed with how easy it is to shoot up. It was my first time ever today since I couldn't get out of a very dark place I was in because of my Bipolar. I was actually really close to suicide so I decided I was gonna do the 75mg I had left. But I wanted at least 2 uses so I decided to try the 0.5cc 31g insulin needles I got.

It was so easy, I got it the first time. Stuck it in a little bit, tried to register, just a tiny bit of blood came up, went further down and I kinda felt the vein pierce and then a spot of blood shot up inside the barrel, the I pushed down on the plunger, and withdrawal disapeared, and that oh so lovely and familiar warmth came over me.

Now all I have to do is ride it out until I can finally see my doctor on the 10th to ask for maintenance because I'm in no psychological state to quit right now. Sadly though, small doses of heroin or pretty big doses of Oxy are the only thing so far that stabilize my mood.

There wasn't much of a ""rush"" though just a very quick feeling of being happy again. I guess you could say heroin saved my life today :P

But I think I'll be putting some serious space between my 2-4 day runs, and maybe even taking a break to do more than just drop my tolerance. so I'll wind down with using less, taking mild codeine and then taking nothing for a couple of weeks. I might just wind down and stop using until the end of the year. idk. 

This isn't just becuse of the title of this thread it's because between my growing tolerance and the money I'm spending I want to know that I still have enough control to stop , even if my main motivation is a lowered tolerance. 

And I'm aware that after I've successfully lowered my tolerance I have to be extra careful about shooting up again. 

I'm noticing some very, very mild bruising along where I've been hitting, I figure this is because I've been hitting the same areas-the crooks of my arms- for weeks now. 

I'm really not comfortable with shooting up in my legs, and I'm not yet good at hitting on the top side of my arm, near my wrist, the back of my hand, etc. 

I had one really nice shot on the back of my hand, it went flawlessly, i was able to tap some blood right away, the shot felt amazing, and when i pulled out it just looked like a little dent and didn't even leave a mark... trying to replicate that left a trail of marks, sadly. 

How concerned should I be about these light bruises that seem to 'hug' the veins I've been hitting regularly??? Will they go away if I leave my veins alone for a coup,e of weeks? are they related to the times I missed my shots? I didn't even notice them until today but I have them on both arms right in the crook of my arms. at first I thought I just had one on the rop of my arm where I unsuccessfully tried to hit a puffy vein without any luck, sadly not. 

FUCK- JUST LOOKED AGAIN, depending on the type of light they're not even visable, i literally can't seem them under this light atm, just the super bright white fluorescent in my bathroom, under the more orange-y light they don't even show up, they're that light. ",1417780564.0

Aaron returned from the cafe to find him unconscious on his back with his mouth filling with vomit, barely breathing. Aaron quickly tipped Jimmy on his side to clear his mouth and airway of vomit then began mouth to mouth. Jimmy soon regained consciousness but felt like shit and immediately went for his meth pipe. Aaron talked him into settling for a joint while he prepared dinner and suggested Jimmy take the heroin intravenously next time he wanted more strength as that would provide a stronger rush without having to imbibe excessive quantities.

I was on 120 mg a day and checked myself into the hospital on Monday to medically detox off of it. The doctor at the hospital tried to talk me out of it, said it was too much to come off of at one time and that I should taper. Thing is I had already tried twice to get my doc at the mdone clinic to start tapering me and he wouldn't, so I felt pretty much trapped.


It sucked pretty hardcore the first couple of days and I just laid there and cried for hours. They were giving me shots of buprenex pretty regularly at first and then the last shot I got was Wednesday morning. It got better on around Wednesday through all the meds they were giving me shots of atavan, robaxin, and ambien to sleep. 

Well I got discharged this afternoon (Thursday) and asked for just a couple of days of the above listed meds for me when I got home bc I know methadone withdrawals are not over in four days, but they wouldn't do it.

Well now I'm home and I'm pretty much back to the state of dying. Every bone in my body feels like it's gonna snap in half, I'm having major restless leg syndrome, as well as my arms being restless too, my body keeps jerking, I'm dizzy and utterly exhausted, and I keep having fits of crying.

Do y'all know of any thing I could be doing at all to make this shit any better? I  wanna go get a shot so bad and say fuck this shit bc I'm such a little baby and really can't handle pain well, but I'm not. I'm a 27 female btw. Thanks y'all.

Update/Edit
So if anyone was curious, I had to go get back on methadone.  I tried to deal with it, but it was a whole new devil that I couldn't handle.  I'd be dope sick from heroin 100 times over with a smile on my face before I put myself through that hell again. I had to go back to work Tuesday after having a little over a week off and I knew there was no way that was gonna be possible if I didn't go back to the clinic. That week off of it did allow me to be on a much lower dose though, and I am currently on 40 mg and I plan to taper off of that slowly and comfortably. 

For those of you wanting to quit such a high dose of methadone cold turkey, I don't recommend it. I know for me it is 100 percent the worst pain I have ever felt in my life.  Thanks again everyone!

Having issues with nausea, and vomiting like 5-8 hours afterwards...","Hi, just wondering if you combine heroin with amphetamines (particularly vyvanse) is it harmful in the sense that it is doing anything bad to your brain? I take 60mg vyvanse daily prescribed with a few breaks in-between, and when I take it in the morning with my dope I feel good until like 4-6 hours after... then I start getting nauseous and start puking even... these sorts of situations have happened about 6-8 times in the past month, and all of them were when I was on vyvanse. I think the combination is pretty euphoric however 5-6 hours in I feel really shitty. I am more prone to the nausea with very potent H..

I know heroin is already fucking destroying me, however is the combination with an amphetamine causing the nausea most likely? I don't get this sort of nausea when I take vyvanse or heroin alone so it's very strange... I took suboxone with vyvanse and suffered no ill-effects however. 

But I am very worried if I am doing any damage by puking like all my dinner out sometimes...  one time I took way too much dope when I was on vyvanse and felt like literal shit puking every 30 minutes for like 4 hours... had to sleep it off. until the yellow bile stuff comes out... I figure this can't be good for me... The thought of heroin even was making me puke during that period. 

But ya... would like your input on this sort of thing. What is causing this? Is there some sort of weird synergy between the two that could be detrimental? I never had issues with nausea when taken separately. 

And anything I could do to avoid it. I can't stop taking the vyvanse because I do really need it for my work, and I can't stop the heroin either (planning to quit very soon... hopefully I'll be done for good...) but for now am I doing anything neurotoxic with this?

I have been using opiates recreationally on and off for about 3 years. Oxy, morphine, primarily Percocet. My drug use is likely pretty mild, by most of your standards, but over the past year I started using regularly enough that I did develop a physical tolerance. Anyway, it started to have a negative impact on my life. Mostly on my bank account, and relationship with my partner. He (my partner) told me we need to cool it with the drugs, ween down, and eventually stop in the next couple months. I agreed. He was out of town. So I figured it was a good time to cold turkey sweat it out. Because if he was here, he would just cave, and go get me more drugs. And also because I figured I was gonna be pretty cranky, and I didn't want to be a bitch to him. Anyway, I went through some mild withdrawal. Hot/cold sweats, runny nose, sneezing, joints hurting, sadness, shits. Mostly just exhaustion. I was able to take a week off work, I mostly just slept a lot, it wasn't that bad. It was no worse than having a flu. I didn't even puke.

Anyway, 7 days sober, for the first time in a long time, I had a super crumby day at work, call my guy, tell him how crumby it was, he sends me some money, and texts a dealer to meet me. I buy 14 Percocet. I snorted 3 of them over the course of a couple hours. Doesn't sound like a lot, but holy hell I feel sick. I have not puked, but I think I am going to. I don't think I have ever puked from doing percs before. Should I be worried? Normally 3 percs would barely produce an effect for me, but I am really high. 

Is it normal for a tolerance to decrease so drastically in a week?

How many percs is is safe to take for a 140 pound women, with apparently no tolerance? 

Should I be worried I have taken too much?

Is it ok to go to sleep?

These might seem like silly questions. It's just been a long time since I have puked from drugs. I am a little worried. Any feedback greatly appreciated.",1417765888.0

Long story short I got a job offer a couple weeks ago. Got through the interview, found out I have to take a hair drug test. I figured that I would have at least a couple days notice so I could attempt to ""wash"" my hair using the vinegar/salyclyc acid/etc. wash along with a shampoo or something I could get from a headshop, or if someone had a better method, that.

Welp, just found out that I have 48 hours from today(Thursday) to take the hair test. Its a Psychemedics one. In the past couple months(well, in the past couple weeks really) I have done cocaine, E/Molly, marijuana, xanax, adderall and BTH. Yeah...fuck me, right? I MAY be able to get it delayed until Monday but I would rather not make up a story(uhh yeah im out of town..) to tell the guy.

So I come begging...has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do? If I start tonight/tomorrow morning with some sort of hair wash, do I have a chance? I'm fully prepared for the worst, but i'm sure as hell not giving up.

Again, any one with any solid advice please, help a brotha out. Whats my best course of action here? I have medium length hair. Is there any way that I could avoid the hair test, take a pee test, and fake that somehow? But I think Psychemedics only does hair.

Anyone here ever bribe the person taking the hair? Or just talk them out of doing it or something like that? Maybe convince them to let you come back with someone elses(clean) hair? Probably a 0.1% chance of that happening but oh well.

There have been a few users the use and have attempted to manipulate words for someone's pleasure. So, I figured I post something.

I guess the norm is getting high, relaxing, nodding, what-have-you, and then posting something. So here goes:

""Anti-hero and the Heroine""

By Monday morning I begin to hate myself.

It was the second night in a row that I awoke to her screaming in pain. Frankly, I was annoyed. Sometimes she could be so selfish, I mean, we are all capable of thinking of ourselves first, but she couldn’t comprehend the fact that she was being selfish even if she wanted to. I guess when your emotional capacity is at an all time low you have trouble being empathetic. Selfish bitch.

“Can you turn the light off?” She asked.

“Yeah, sorry. Just give me five minutes.”

“Oh, I’m sorry.”

“Huh?”

“I think you misunderstood me.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I’m sure I asked you to turn the light off. I don’t think I asked you to do that in five minutes. Did I?”

“I’m not doing this,” I said, my voice monotone.

“Doing what?” She questioned, her voice starting to rise.

I wave my arm, “This.”

“What is ‘this’? Huh? What the fuck is ‘this’?”

Have you ever seen footage of someone screaming on a mountain and starting an avalanche?

“Arguing. I’m not arguing,” I said.

Prepare for impact…

This is wrong. I should start at the beginning. The trouble is knowing where to start. What constitutes the beginning? When we first met, our first real conversation, the kiss that changed everything? Was it me asking her out to dinner? That day in the park? The night she cried to me on the phone for a couple of hours? Unfortunately I do not think any of that matters. There are plenty of good moments, but in this case that would not give the meaning to this story the right tone. It’s not about a relationship turned sour. It’s about the snowball effect. It’s about the time at my apartment. The night I tied her arm. It was the moment I inserted the needle into her once lively and beautiful vein. It was the look in her eyes. It was the euphoria.

Substance: A dream like state. Ignore what you’ve been told. Of course there are ups and downs, but isn’t that the case with everything? That question was rhetorical. This isn’t a topic that is up for discussion. You will find that most of the people who are in the midst of this dependency keep to themselves. It’s better that way. That isn’t to say that favors won’t be asked, or that social acceptance has totally dissipated, because that is untrue. That is where manipulation comes into play. You learn to become everyone’s friend, and all the while the relationships you cultivate are done so with a motive. Honestly, there is nothing honest about drugs. It’s not fashionable. I don’t think a blown vein was ever a fashion statement. It is what it is, plain and simple, it’s personal choice. The only problem is knowing the difference between complete dependence and occasional use. It’s a very thin line. Needle thin.

There is a kind of romance that goes along with heroin. The needle gleams in the candle light, the brown powder starts to bubble, the needle mixes it around, it swirls. Stronger than a cup of coffee, weaker than a peaceful sleep. Although some people may go about their intake methods differently, it still had an order to it, a personal preference. 

She winces as the needle enters her vein, the pain is moderate, but doesn’t last long. Instant euphoria overcomes her and her wince turns into a calm, I can see her eyes moving around her closed lids. She looks beautiful.

My friend and I have been discussing what drug would be something both of us want to try next(sounds like we have a checklist haha, but its  not that literal), and the idea of heroin popped up. Having access to the darknet but no local dealers in my area, I feel that it is safer than finding a hookup through someone where I live in case I do feel the urge to buy again, because I am going to try to make this a one time thing. 

So my questions are as follows: 
* How much is a starting point to take?
* Is bumping the way to go other than shooting(Will NOT do) or is smoking it fathomable?
* With the little amount of research I have pulled out of google's ass, what precautions do I need to take before I begin, like do I need to take benadryl or something else?
* Anything else that I should know beforehand, besides it being extremely addictive?

That's it for now, I will add questions if I get some good answers or if I can think of any more, thanks for your time! Oh also, I am not sure how you guys react to first timers, but I would prefer to get as little hate as possible, thanks =)

Anyway I've been using opiates on and off for 5 years but mostly pills back then. I started chipping heroin a year ago but I just moved from ""Heroin Island"" to a place where I can't find any heroin at all so I've been using Oxys. My Kratom should be here tomorrow. 

I've dated a lot of heavy users and addicts and a marginal number of the people I grew up with are now doing dope. I lost three close friends in the past year. It seems inevitable for everyone who doesn't leave my home town for college. I'm sure some of you can relate. I like reading all of your posts because in a fucked up way opiates = home in my head. I think I might have to go back there someday soon and do harm reduction like Tracey.

My opiate journey started with my first true love.. Tramadol.  I believe that I metabolize this drug better than just about anybody.  It gave me more energy than Oxy at the beginning of my high and I was nodding like a motherfucker by the end of it.  I was taking it daily starting with a  dose of 500mg and then probably another 200-300 mg throughout the rest of the day.  

I began to do poorly in college and eventually I had a seizure in front of my best friend that I've know and lived with since I was 5 yrs old.  He called my parents and the next morning I was on a plane to Nebraska to get clean.  My rents were extremely supportive albeit very unfamiliar with opiate addiction.  I will say don't take tramadol lightly.  Compared to any other withdrawal I've experience this was by far and away the worst.

Fast forward two years and My friend that called my parents and saved my life was falling into heroin pretty badly and needed somewhere to go.  I bought him a plane ticket up here and he lived with me and got well with the help of me and my parents.  

I landed a pretty good job and me and the friend got a place together. After a short time because of the people he associates himself with he comes across some opana 40 E and they are constantly available. (Yes you can shoot these, yes it is awesome, no if you prepare it properly it is not very dangerous)  Long story short since its been told a million times he moves to heroin and starts selling it and i start doing it as well.  Before I know it regardless of my attempts I am physically dependent again.  

A year goes buy and Ive lost my house started to destroy the credit I was building and am seriously financially in debt.  I told my parents I relapsed today and again they are extremely supportive and am giving me another chance to detox in the house and my mom who is completely straight edge scored me some clonzepam to help.  

The kid i was doing heroin with IV by the way has now really brought on the ire of my parents.  I don't think I'm going to be able to see or hang out with this kid again because I honestly believe he has no intention of stopping until hes dead.  It just sucks... hes my best friend I've known my entire life.

Ive had quite the history with opiates, oc's to be exact. Was hooked pretty hard for 3-4 yrs. went to impatient, was on methadone for 2 yrs and somehow i was able to kick the habit.

It's been over 4 yrs since i was on methadone/used opiates for the last time, and i have recently stumbled upon tough times. Life is not what it used to be, i have been drinking pretty heavily the last 6 months, like 18 beers minimum a day, drinking in the morning, at work, on the way home from work, after i get home etc etc. 

I recently lost my gf of 3.5 yrs, and she took my dog too. Sucks big time. I've been a total fucking recluse (which isnt really like me) the last month or so, and been on total self destruct mode. Drinking even more, poppin Xanax and Adderall (got scripts for both) and the last week i have been seriously considering gettin some blues...

I've never done blues before, they weren't around when i was usin, just the good ol big boys (oc 80s). And IV was my roa..

Basically i feel like my life is falling apart, i have become too anxious to even leave my house cept for gettin beer and going to work. It fucking sucks, I'm not trying to have you all pity me but i just need some advise

I always felt like before i had to hit my rock bottom to start to make my way back up to the top. And i have basically decided using opiates again would do that for me. It sounds so fucking dumb, why break an almost 5 year streak? I dont know, because i feel like fucking dying and if i could get right a few times that might make me see the light again.

Ugh im just ranting really at this point, but i have no friends i can talk to about this shit, i ditched all my junkie pals when i quit, and all my current friends are married and got their lives together. I used to be the top dog with all my shit straight then it all just came crashing down and im close to losing it, i feel like im gonna go postal.

I dont have a close relationship with anyone in my family(cept for my bro whos locked up), and again i dont have any real friends i could just vent to about this kinda stuff.



Even though i got a good job, money in the bank, good credit blah blah all the shit that ppl r after, i feel like a pile of shit, and seriously been thinking about just going off the deep end. I could have one hell of a bender lol. 

Should i break my 4 year sobriety(with opiates) and try to feel a little better? Something's gonna give here soon, and I'd rather be in a nice warm place when it happens (with oxy flowin through my veins) this alcohol shit is getting outta hand. I think i could manage occasional opiate use better.

Sorry for the wall ppl, my mind is just all over the fucking place. And i came across an old friend who could hook me up without anyone knowin the difference and im seriously considering it.. Oxy always gave me that devine feeling where nothing could stop me.


Any advice ? I love u all (again sorry for the rant, im bout 12 beers deep and just popped another 20 addy, I'll be up and open to anyone's input)

2oicy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2oicy6/im_having_an_identity_crisis/,55,https://redd.it/2oicy6,nycarpe,I'm having an identity crisis,"As I sit here in a decrepit halfway house, I find that no matter how much time goes by I mentally obsess over opiates. I cannot shake the thought and the na meetings seem totally unrelatable to me. I was never in a ditch shooting 8 balls or prostituting myself. I'm just a 22 year old guy who smoked a lot of weed, started smoking blues, then smoking heroin, and then started shooting. What worries me is how much of my mental energy is devoted to heroin. 

The drug itself isn't the root of all of my problems, it's the way that I act when I don't have it, the way I interact with people. I feel like i'm having an identity crisis. I've invested so much time watching every heroin documentary on youtube. I could tell you how to synthesize fent but I couldn't tell you when my sister's birthday is.

I know this isn't the life I want to live. But for some reason my mind keeps imagining ...another shot....another score....another bag... I feel like i'm going fucking crazy most of the time. These days I've alienated myself from almost everyone. I don't speak to anyone in this halfway house. I've been here for 2 weeks and i'm pretty sure most people think i'm some guy who has been traumatized by some terrible experience. 

Earlier this year I tried methadone. It was the worst experience of my life. It was expensive and everyone looked down on me as if I wasn't 'enough of a junkie.' I swore I would never go back but here I am looking up methadone clinics, even though it's not allowed in my halfway house. I'm really tempted to say fuck the halfway house and go get the help that I need and try to just make it on my own.

But the rational part of me says 6 months from now i'll hate being on methadone just as much as I hate being in this situation right now. It seems that there is no solace with opiates, and no solace without. I just wish I never started fucking around with this drug. fuck. I was so successful when I just smoked weed. I was in college, I had a car, a girlfriend, a job, friends. Those things have slowly disappeared as my addiction has gotten to where it is now.
 
I feel like I was born into the wrong world, or the wrong culture. I really want to leave this place but I don't know where to go. I'm really unhappy with this life and I feel directionless. It seems like half of the 20 something year olds these days are happy and have their shit together, and the other half are just fucked. I would give anything to rewind a few years so I could appreciate what I had instead of going down the road of addiction which for some reason just seemed to damn appealing at the time.
 
When i'm out of this house the first thing i'm working towards is getting a medical card and going back to the trees. I used to think, hmm, I should have grown out of weed by now, it's an immature thing to do, I can't clear out fast for job drug tests. But honestly if I had smoked myself retarded and never touched heroin i'd be fine right now. I look at the r/trees subreddit and remember getting 'ripped off' by getting shorted a gram when I bought a quarter. Wow. it seems like a foreign concept to consider 20 dollars gone being ripped off. I look at how they come together to smoke and watch movie, go on dates, and just do things together. I've spent so much time alone and i'm so out of touch with ordinary drugs like weed that I forgot people get high together. And it's an event. Not just a daily routine.
 
I'm sorry for this long post but i've just been really depressed and i've had these same thoughts running a racket in my brain and i've had no one to talk to since my phone was stolen. the tl;dr is that life used to be a lot better before opiates (not surprising), i've alienated myself from everyone I know because i'm ashamed of where I am in life, I obsessively think about scoring, and i've been reminiscing a lot about the days when weed was my drug of choice.

now that this is off my chest i'm off to drown myself in netflix shows on a saturday night and attempt to forgive myself for all the shit i've put myself through. Thanks for reading. ",1417915009.0

Unfortunately, I have to work and I can't take time off. Am I likely to be well enough to go in? Does sub make that much of a difference? Will I have all the same symptoms?

My alternative is to leave it until mid January when I can take time off work - but if possible I'd love to be off them by Christmas.

I have tried to cut back but still feel as if I am not myself until I take it.  I know Kratom is the safest alternative but part of me still wants to say screw the Kratom and go get my usual hyrdos, oxycodone, hydromorphone. My guy continues to hit me up and lets me know what he has.  Guy gets ungodly amounts of narcotics! I guess I am just ranting.  Opiates have become my lover.  I can't seem to shake her off of me and she keeps wanting to come back in my life.  Part of the reason I am wanting to let her come back is because there is no one (real) who wants to take her place.  I need to find that someone who I can talk to about my struggles.  Its hard seeing how my last relationship was a bust after I put my heart and soul into it.  Any ladies out there need a guy to talk to about anything feel free to let me know I am an open ear and always love to meet someone new outside of my city. Now don't construe these comments.  I am not a junkie by any means.  I am a fully functioning person when I take opiates. I also have a full time sales job.  I actually sell the worlds top liquors i.e. Crown Royal, Johnnie Walker, Ketel One, Smirnoff, Captain Morgan etc.  In fact I have more energy and a clearer head when taking painkillers.  My anxiety is no where to be found and my minor ADHD no longer is an issue.  I would have such productive days when taking painkillers because I wouldn't want to hurry and finish to get home so I can get rid of my pain.

*Opiate addiction is the one addiction that you're pretty much coherent through the whole process.*

Let me explain. It seems to me that with meth and booze you're inebriated throughout. People sped up on meth are clearly affected in the head. Geeking out, ect. But with opiates, unless you're nodding, your thoughts are pretty much still logical. You get high, but not inebriated. Therefore you're brutally aware, unlike any other drug, as you go deeper and deeper into addiction. 

Thoughts? I've never been addicted to meth or alcohol do my perspective isn't all it could be.",1417897908.0

Its been 3 days since I did any opiates so I am back down to baseline and here is what I can say about the subjective effects of oxymorphone (oxyM) versus oxycodone (oxyC).

Well....for me I'll probably never pay to do oxyM again. I simply didn't think its effects are worth the significantly higher price for the drug. I am one of the users who enjoys the peppy feeling I get from oxyC, and that effect is simply absent for me in oxyM. I get a real major lazy nod going on from the oxyM and some people may totally like that....but I don't. OxyC allows me to get shit done and not feel pain....whereas oxyM glues my ass to the couch like a first time stoner smoking high grade weed.... with the added effect of nodding out. I usually take 150mg of OxyC to get the effect I most prefer....I did 40mg of oxyM on monday and 80mg on tues and the effects were so vastly different than oxyC that I decided I needed a week off from opiates to reset my clock. I just got soooooo fucking wrecked off oxyM that I felt worthless to the world for a couple days. 

So for those of you on the fence about trying oxyM.... this is one oxyC users experience with the current fad opiate. Just do not expect the effects to mirror oxyC beyond pain relief. If you like vegging out and sitting in the velvety soft couch cushions of life.....you might like it....I prefer the warm velvety LIVELY leisure suit sensation of oxyC, because I have an active life and I can't afford to be incapacitated by pain killers.

in many of the lope threads i read people wanted to know the level of use...
half a point to a point per night in a rig. I'm really going to try and go half a point for 3 days this time. we'll see. 

for me after the second day I always felt like i was on the mend but still feel crappy, that was when i was just snorting tho.

I have had a chronic ankle/foot issue for many years now and it doesn't look as though it's going to be getting better.  I'm pretty sure this is going to be a lifelong thing to whatever extent.  It can be quite painful at times, and if you haven't experienced it yourself, chronic pain, in the true sense of the word is something entirely different that normal pain.  It is something that is always present, nagging and affects me every day of my life.

So I'm thinking that managing it with pain medication at times will be necessary.  I was going to source something my self via DNM's, but am now just thinking of telling this to my doctor.  I've had vicodin/Norco in the past after surgeries and stuff but in general it's not great and I know there are better opiates.  I'm aware of the risk of addiction and all that jazz.

Anywho, I've been middlemanning (womaning? Whatever) for a few months for a couple people and I've noticed some things that kinda make me question if im asking too much.To get this clear, I always drive, make sure my boys ride with me so they're at ease. I never take longer than 10minutes from start to finish, everything is always set up before they even get in my car and they get any deals that I get, not to mention letting the guys know if the dealer throws me anything so they don't have to (probably a mistake) So I think im a fair middleman, no matter how sick I've been, I wont try to scam anyone, call me silly but I believe in karma. And I also have been through a shitty middleman for years who fucked me out of so much money so I know how it feels and don't want anyone to feel fucked that way.Well, I think I've been too nice. These people are getting pills, quite a few at that and then deciding to not give me anything anymore since they've ""hooked me up so many times before"".. I guess since they have paid the ""middleman tax"" consistently before, they think they're exempt now.Idk /r/opiates, am I being ridiculous asking for one pill each time? I thought it was common knowledge that if you go through a middleman, you're bound to pay something. I mean, lately I've been guilted into not getting anything and im trying to figure if I need to put my foot down because at this point, I'm pretty much just wasting time and gas and only making my dealer any benefit.Happy nods, folks <3",1418010721.0

How does one moved forward in a relationship that has caused me so much pain yet so much joy/happiness? Get a hotel room, have crazy wild, passionate loud sex, then walk away? Just ignore his pleas for help when I still adore/love him? There are two worlds inside me - one that pulls toward good, one that pulls toward bad. Sin, in greek, means to miss the mark of humanity. Do I go with pleasure or  reasons? I have so many ideas I want to come to life, and baby, you're just distracting me with your drug/shoplifting/giving me black eye drama. A week ago, ""I want to change, I can't believe I'm here."" - yesterday - ""I want more night at being bad - let's get a hotel."" 

I give up. I pray for my death this year. I'm too much of a pussy to commit suicide. I just want good in my life, growth, experience, music, and lots of good sex. This is where my recovery comes into question; I have two roads in front of me, and sadly, with my whatever the hell inside speaking to me, I already know I'm attracted to the most painful path. So if I'm complaining that my life sucks even more in months to come, please shoot me out of my misery. Sadly slapping doesn't work, I already tried it with a few guys.

If anyone has advice on something coming out of jail that hasn't gotten the idea that heroin leads fucking no where good but only more misery, please shoot me something. I love him, the last time I let him go I found in a couple of weeks ago homeless, shooting up, sharing needles, I took him back in to clean him up to only have him shoplift and head to jail. I already caught him in a few lies. kjlkj I just have no idea. I'm so stupid. My mother OD when I was 17 and died, I met him in recovery and we never used together. I don't know. I don't know. 

<br>Background information: I just turned 26 a couple of days ago. He turns 26 early next year. he doesn't have a job, I do, he walked out on me in October to sleep with other people, finally fucked a hoe that threw him to the streets, and now according to him he realizes who really loves him... He wants me to be his saving grace, and I just don't know. I don't want to be part of this criminal lifestyle anymore. Withdrawing in jail isn't for me (I'm on methadone, but I'm on a dose lower than a lot of the people at my clinic & currently weening off, I haven't used heroin in the past 11 months). I'm not saying I'm better than anyone, I've made some pretty shitty life choices that I have paid the price for a lot, I'm just four years away from thirty, and I'm tired of throwing my life away in a relapse. If he goes to use in that hotel, I JUST know I will, and I know he's been withdrawing in jail, and I can find empathy with an addict because...I am one!  But goddamn, I don't want to get back in the hamster wheel to avoid being dope sick if this relapse leads to a true relapse.",1418008587.0

long time lurker first time actually posting and im in a bit of a situation and need some help...


I have a decent gram/day iv habit of heroin.  So, yesterday, on sunday(its 1am so techincally two days ago) I very mistakenly took 8mg of suboxone when i started to feel dope sick, this was about 21 hours after my last shot of about a half gram on saturday.  taking the 8mg sent me into hardcore precipitated withdrawal which lasted all night and well into monday. The withdrawal did not reside only got slightly better as the day went on.  

Ive been doing a lot of reading and research about suboxone induction since then, and from what ive learned is that if you go into precipitated withdrawal from taking a sub too early, taking more dope will bring you out of the withdrawal granted you dose enough, and then after that you should be okay to dose suboxone AGAIN after the dose of H.  And so that is what I did, I wound up IVing about a half gram at 4pm on monday today. My question to you guys, is how long after my shot of heroin today, monday at 4pm, how long should i wait before taking my next dose of sub.  Also from what ive read is that i should dose 1-2mg at a time every 30 minutes until I feel okay.  In your experiences and knowledge, is this all true?  Ive read that taking a full agonist AFTER you have entered precipitated withdrawal is a sort of ""trick"" to dealing with the precip wd and then being able to continue with the suboxone dosing.  I just need to make sure I'm not going to send myself back into precip wd again.

Luckily, my W/D's, while not a walk in the park, is relatively tame compared to other peoples. I've been on opi's pretty much every day for 7 years now and still I can manage to function and go to work while in W/Ds. Only real downside is my already bad back pain (chronic pain patient) is 100x worse, I get bad runs, oh and then there's the debilitating, almost crippling depression. Aside from that it's tame. However, I was all set to get right today after my guy got out of work. I work overnight, so I was attempting to sleep. Fortunately I have a script for Ambien. I downed a few of those at 12:00 PM, knowing I had to be awake for 5:00. I set my alarm for 4:45. Got up at 4:45 with my alarm, went to reach out to my guy and he said he would call me in 45 minutes. Okay, cool! Unfortunately, I was still under the influence of the Ambien... I slept through 3 of his calls with my phone on full blast as I do when I need to wake up via phone call...

Two hours later, I wake up! Freaking out, I call my guy several times, no answer. I continue to text him. He had been asleep! I managed to wake him up out of a dead sleep after about 20 minutes. Luckily, he had mentioned that he left my things in his car and to just leave the money there. Also, thankfully he generally stays at a place basically around the corner from me. I'm thanking Junkie Jesus because he's very fickle and if I'm not there when he is out, I have to wait. It was just two points, however I will be getting more tomorrow (payday, baby! With overtime from Thanksgiving and black Friday!). I just really needed something to get me through to tomorrow, and I got very lucky he was cool with me tonight.

Pretty much pointless rambling, but I had to explain my excitement to someone, and my friends don't really understand that sort of excitement, haha. Thanks for listening!

Do you regret getting into it? Do you think it'll drive you to the needle? How many people started sniffing it saying they would NOT use the needle, and now DO use the needle? That's the one I'm most interested in. Do you feel like it's no worse than insufflating oxycodone? Or do you feel it's harder to control your urge to sniff it compared to other sniffing other stronger opiates? One thing I've heard is it makes your tolerance rise very quickly, but maybe that wasn't meant about heroin specifically. Anyway, I'd be interested to hear your experiences!",1418081126.0

So last night I'm driving home from work. Like an idiot, I decided I would drive home on a different road than the one I normally take. It was around 9:45m. As i'm driving I notice a cop car in the center lane. Now i'm going 50mph in a 50 zone in the left lane because the other cars were going 40 and I'm trying to get home, I'm tired after a 9 hour shift.

So my exit is coming up and I put on my turn signal, switch lanes once. wait a few seconds, put on my turn signal, and switch lanes again. Extremely legally as far as I'm concerned. I notice the cop is following me now after taking the exit. So remember, I was going 50 in a 50, used my turn signal to safely change lanes, took the exit going maybe 20mph. So this cop follows me for a few minutes, then flashes his lights, Im thinking what the fuck i did nothing wrong. So i pull over and I proceed to look around for my insurance and shit.

Anyway, he approaches my car tells me I pulled you over because I noticed you changed lanes from the other side of the road (its only a 3 lane road) and I'm thinking yeah... so.... and i tell him I know I was driving the speed limit and that I had used my turn signals. As i go to reach for my insurance and shit he tells me He would like me to step out of the car. Im thinking what the fuck I've never been asked to step out of the car before. So i ask him why and he says he's an officer and he's allowed to ask me to do that. So I'm like okay whatever. 

I get out of the car and he goes there's a bag of heroin on your left door panel, and I'm like WHAT what are you talking about? and he's like I'm gonna go grab for it alright. So he grabs for it and its the top part of a blue dope bag, nothing at all is in it though so effectively it's a piece of paper.

Anyway, now I'm like panicking and shit. He calls up a buddy which is routine for anything drug related and They both start questioning me. I'm playing dumb saying I have no idea what that blue piece of wax paper even is and the other cop says okay come over here let me see your eyes. Thankfully the last time i had used was way earlier that day so my pupils were fine. After they do that I tell them my story, which is true for the record.

I say, listen officers I know you get lied to all the time and the best thing to do is tell the truth to an officer (haha yeah right, but in this case it was the truth) so I proceed to tell them that my best friend, who is active on these forums btw is currently in rehab in PA, I give them the name of the rehab and his name and tell them he uses my car sometimes and he literally just went to rehab a week ago so if something is in my car it has to be his.

The officer tells me he would like to search me and my car and that I have to give him consent and that I can stop the search at any time. I think for a moment trying to think if i have like weed or something in the car but decide that I do not. so i figured maybe the more cooperative i am the easier they will be on me. So they one officer searches me completely, then proceeds to search my car. top to bottom, even opened my trunk which i didn't know they could do.

meanwhile the other officer is shooting the shit with me, asking me where i go to school , what my major is what I want to do, I tell them i have relatives in the force (i don't but i figured it'd be good to say) we talk  about that and after a while I'm like officer please be straight up with me are you going to fuck my life up tonight for something my friend left in my car who is currently getting help for his addiction. He says its up to the officer who pulled me over. I tell him I think that this country needs to get with the times and stop arresting people for using drugs and instead get them help, I ask him what he thinks and he says he's being recorded so he doesn't want to give his opinion.

moving on, after the one cop stops searching my car i ask him if he found anything and before he finished he asked me if he had a risk of being poked with a needle i said no my friend doesn't use needles and he's telling me if they do happen to find something then my friend can come to court and claim its his. okay so, he finishes searching, doe snot find anything at all, I ask him if there was anything in the bag he found and he said no. He then tells me to take a seat in my car and then says I won't give you a ticket for the lane change, and go home and drive safe, and make sure your friend stays off the dope when he gets back.

Im thinking holy shit are these officers letting me go after finding an empty bag of dope, thank you junkie jesus. I then proceeded to go buy some bags and roxies since thats where i was going in the first place and took all back roads cause i was nervous as shit.

This happened in NJ, after it all went down i was wondering, can you be arrested for just having the top half (so not even residue) and a bag of heroin? so basically could i have been charged for having the top of a blue wax paper. if anyone knows let me know because Id like to think these guys believed my story since it was true and let me go, or maybe it was just that they had nothing to charge me with.

anyway though, stay safe guys!

ps what doesn't make sense at a lllllll is how there was even a empty bag in my car. I've never used in my car, ever, and its not like I've ever used and been like oh hey lets take the empty bags and just put them in my car, that'd be smart. so I'm still trying to figure out how it got there in the first place and even went as far as to think perhaps they planted it there. idk nothing makes sense.

I had to stay late and basically just a ton of physical labor. So i'm dying there man. Like sweats and sniffs - full blown withdrawals. I took about 5 mgs of methadone which is barely anything just to get me to the end of the shit. While I was at work my lovely s.o. went and copped for us, which she never ever does alone. Not to mention she was as sick if not sicker than me. Anyways our guy messed up her order somehow, and he's not our regular dude so this kid (can't be older than 17 I swear) is so desperate for our business he gave her a free bundle for her troubles. Yay! Anyways so when I got home from work she was waiting for me all pretty and smelling good with a shot all loaded - three bags to take it on home. But the best part was that I hit a vein, which lately hardly ever happens, and I got a great fucking rush. Best in a looong time.

D;,"I probably sound like a pussy writing this, but I'm worried. I haven't been able to get needles at my usual pharmacy, as a family friend started working in the pharmacy area of where I frequented for needles. My work has needles, so I've been taking them here and there. But, the needles at work kinda suck. The smallest gauge they have is 27g. They work fine, I register, all is fine & well; & That's all thanks to me having garden hose veins-every other girl I know is jealous of that. Hehe.

Anyhow, I am worried that I might be missing a tiny bit every time. I have to be, right? Can a vein handle 27g? Because of the large gauge I constantly am registering; re-registering to make sure when I do my shots. I'm scared that I am partially missing or something with these large gauge needles. What I'm thinking is happening is I'm in the vein, but a part of the needle is piercing through the other side of the vein & making a tiny hole for me to miss part of the shot. The things suck anyhow because the needle part is removable, and the area where it (the needle) goes on, the plunger doesn't go up to, so I'm wasting that little bit of dope that ends up in there. (of which I usually just remove the needle and shoot into my mouth).

I'm just worried because: A) I shouldn't be stealing from work. Especially something like needles. Cus' firstly, my boss would find out I'm shooting drugs if he found out. & of course the whole stealing from work is wrong & blahblahblah. B) The whole possibly missing parts of shots. Which could result in so much horrible shit. (infection, abscess)  & Lastly, C) This large gauged needle is fucking up my skin & could cause lots of bad scarring. It's making my track marks (which were virtually un-noticable before when I had normal 31g needles) wayyyyyy more noticable & It's fucking horrible looking. Long sleeve forever for me. Also, I'm constantly applying neo-sporin (spelling?) (Which all of you should do to your track marks too-it helps scarring)

Now, let me cut to the chase. I've been to a few other pharmacies (went to two others) and they didn't give me them to me. I don't know why, because in my state (PA... is this sourcing? if so, forgive me.) they have a law about being able to buy needles from places without a Rx. So why aren't they letting me buy them? (I'm not expecting anyone to answer that one, lol) In my years of doing this shit, I've NEVER had a problem buying needles. But what I do want to know are any tips on getting needles that anyone might have? I've never ever had a problem before. But, the place I had no problems at before I can't go to because of the whole family friend working at the pharmacy. It's difficult for me to up and go to a bunch of pharmacies because I don't drive& It's VERY cold outside where I live. So getting around is tough. Everyone says to buy them online, but I don't have a card that I'm able to buy stuff online with (Thank god, or I'd be shopping like a mad-woman). So0o0o0o0o0oo yeah. Just was wondering any tips, or any of your guys' thoughts on this. Thanks guys!

Happy days.,"The following is a true story, that happened only a few hours before I posted this. I will keep this post updated at things progress.


Today is Mon 8th December 2014 in the UK


Well this is a bit of an unexpected turn in events for me. Long story short, I am now sat here with 7.5g of Speed Paste of the numero uno ""what the fuck just happened"" variety. A free gift for me, with lots, and lots.... so much more, to do with what we haven't decided yet.

It's been moved away from my house. That cursed bastard should have never brought it here in the first place. But he always comes to me. Ain't I fucking lucky.

I mean don't get me wrong. I used to do a fuck load of Speed back in the early 90's. Enjoyed it. But the stuff we got lasted for like, I don't know. Around 8 hours if I remember right. Nasty fucking comedown too.

Jump forward about 20 years and ""KerPow"". This shit arrives at my house with a mate who clearly hadn't slept in like forever, completely fucked up. Pupils so large and dark they absorbed light from the surrounding area while drawing shit towards them, like two hypnotic black holes. ""It came in from Poland m8. Over on a fairground ride. It's not been touched m8, it's a pure as you can get.""

Please God, why does this drug ravaged monster all ways comes to me for help. Have I got TWAT written across my for head or something.

I immediately knew that whatever this was he was on clearly was not designed for lesser beings such as us mere humans. When he opened up the rucksack light spilled out and the archangel Michaels trumpet sounded. 

I was intrigued.

So there we both sat, in my lounge, with what I can only describe as a 10kg, possibly more, I don't have any scales that big here, white, moist, wet clay like slab. I look at him with shear horror. 

""What the fuck have you done now m8?""

Then he tells me.

Speaking like a fucking chipmunk on fast forward he starts to explain the day.

""Well m8. I woke up bursting for a fucking shit."" 
I looked at him pretty confused. ""What the fuck you babbling about, he who looks like he is preparing to accend to the next fucking level of existence. What the fuck is going on m8?. What the fuck is that. Please tell me that's not fast. How much is their? Why is it on my fucking table next to my cuppa fucking tea. What the fuck is going on? You fancy a brew m8? I got bourbons and digestives in the kitchen.""

I love my cuppa tea. Cuppa tea fixes everything.

I was a little alarmed as you can tell. At this point I had my wife due home in around 4 hours, my son around the same time.

He sat their for a moment, chewing his bottom lip, then his top one. Drumming his fingers, fidgeting about. I fear if given enough time without doing something other than sitting still, he would have probably chewed his own face off. 

""I only had a tiny bit m8, like fuck all. A fucking tiny speck. This shit don't seem to fucking ever end m8... I'm fooooked."" Then starts giggling.

""The tiny fucking bit was like.... I don't know... It was fucking small m8, tiny. Like a 1/10th of a gram, now I am fucked. It don't seem to slow down."" He then told me, possibly about 7 times, about how he took this, speck, 23 hours ago.

That's right, he said 23 hours ago. For those of you who don't live in the UK, amphetamine sulphate is probably the strongest upper in the amphetamine class of drugs. At least it is in the smaller towns and villages like I do.

""You got that wrong m8. Fast don't last 23 hours of pure UP. Fuck, it only lasts 4 - 8 hours, then the comedown hits home."" 

I am genuinely worried at this point. If this was speed paste, which he claimed, and looked, felt and smelled just like I remember. Then where the fuck did this behemoth of pure cosmic energy come from? How strong must this be to annialate a seasoned multi drug veteran.
  
What had transpired the the previous few days for my m8 that lead to today's speed fest.

My intrigue was defiantly growing at this point.

Well, you are not gonna find out just yet. I don't have time to type it. Sorry. Just noticed the time. Shit to do so see ya later people, and stay safe.

Most people always told me I was an idiot and that it would lose it's magic, which I suppose it has, but I feel content and energetic all the time. Not high at all, I get the most subtle little buzz when it kicks in that maybe lasts an hour, but my mood is completely regulated and I feel like a very good version of sober.

It's 6:23 AM and I haven't slept at all and maybe (doubt it) got an hour of sleep the night before or dosed in the same time frame. Had a year or two when I was a young'un of eating a lot of oxy, tramadol, hydro, morphine and what have you, so second time through this mess. For close three years I could keep it down to once, twice a month, but around two months of ago went on a bender and kept going since. I had trouble sleeping the first time around but not to this extent, though other symptoms were way worse. The only difference this time around is that I've been using primarily suboxone (sublingual or intranasal). Two main questions: Is suboxone withdrawal different from other opioid withdrawals? I've tried a bunch of OTC sleep aids and they are totally bunk, how do I get to sleep.

People talk about saving cottons, how safe is this really? I know cotton can make you sick, or rather there's a bacteria(forget the name) 

what if i was to save all my cottons in a small jar and keep it sealed shut and in the fridge? How are people saving these cottons? I just suck on mine after squeezing what's left into the cooker and snorting whatevers there with my dropper. 

Tell me about ""Dope that creeps"" plz.  I had a shot of some new shit tonight and the rush seemed a little delayed , even after taking what for me should have been a strong shot, especially after a break of over 4 solid days with nothing.

fent hits hard and fast and leaves quickly if I'm not mistaken.  this was still fast-iv is iv- but it was a little bit of a creeper shot compared to the amazing bight white shit i was shooting previously. no complaints more than anything I hope it has serious legs.  this is a little light brownish, really wish they still had the bright white chunks but this crew is my only good choice anyway, my other one is a group of 'kids' and everything is always powdered, but hey i know powder doesn't have to be bad and people can re-rock, i know i know...i get that...but around here the chunky shit has alllllwayyys been so mucn better imo.

Asked my dealer is dope is way cheaper downtown? I see you guys and others talking about the suburbs / downtown difference in American towns. I'm in the general Vancouver area but there's a lot of shit outside Vancouver. So I hope saying I'm in the lowermainland of BC isn't breaking any rules, shits fucking huge. it's like saying I'm in South-Western BC, there's a bunch of cities.

I'm hours away from the infamous Downtown Eastside of Vancouver by bus but I don't live in Vancouver. If I'm passing thru -Van not East & Hastings-I think I'll grab a bag here and there but I worry about more cut, and that's exactly what he told me, he also told me he doesn't know if there's a difference in price, ...the latter part is clearly unture. of course he knows better than I. 

I have friends down there but I can't really fire a heroin question at them without them worrying for no damn reason. 

I wasn't supposed to pick up tonight, and I wasn't supposed to have any weed left to sell but a desperate friend called and he was really hurting for some pot...sure enough after some digging i found about .5 of some great hash, a joints worth of pot and a bunch of rub gloves i didn't know I had tucked away in my work bag. I gave him all that and the promise of all the gloves I'll get tomorrow at work for $20. I like being generous with him , he's right across the street and him and his gf gave me a fat bag of food when i was hungry, just a ridiculous amount of food, and I wont forget that. 

I was on a break but I figured fuck it's going to be Wednesday soon anyway, once I got high it was... and my wd seemed mostly over , so mild that I feel this was a real break. plus I slept thru the day after not being able to sleep for a day,. it feels great to be high this early and have a jump on the day, when my bro picks me up I'll be there on time instead of making him wait as i run around to get ready on time and I can start snacking on the crew doughnuts and chips etc right away on the way down to the site while sipping my coffee. Fuck Yes.

And now I have another shot for later at work. 

Today is going to be a good day. and I wont be bothered if i have to wait a bit for dope after work, I wish they still had my fave dope but I'll buy a half gram of this. 

I'm so fucking pleased. 

***tl;dr version*** for slow readers and/OR people that don''t give a shit. :D

How safe is it to save iv cottons and what's the safest way to do it?

Dope that creeps, what's the deal with that? 
iv dope that doesn't hit as fast as other batches but still seems ok.

How different are the prices in most suburbs vs downtown, my dealer claims he doesn't even know if there's a difference-which i doubt- but he says ""you're going to find more buff"" and if he's only talking about the infamous Downtown Eastside sure I'd agree, but I'm thinking people you call on the phone in nicer areas, not junkies trying to pull a fast one on other junkies to pay for their own shit. Surely there are good dealers hours away from me I just don't know them. ",1418201485.0

seeing this I decided to take this oppprtunity to get off it but the wd is just unbearable specially in my work which is usually outside, and requires heavy lifting or exertion.. 

at first I saw I had some tylenol 3s so I decided to take those to lessen the wd then it ran out and my dr wont prescribe it. I also saw I have some nice amounts of lorazepams but im kinda weary of that, having heard and seen the addiction that it can cause and the wd is much worse.

I have tried it...it has helped with the pain and anxiety...took 1mg once or twice in a day, two days, non consecutive in a week...

last night I also realised I had concerta 36 mg(I think xr) back from 2006...from a previes add presc. and saw that as long as u have kept them in a cool dark area they preservr well..any way I had an exam this morning so I took around 5 of those pills in an intervsl of 5 hours (not regular)...and my wd symptoms were pretty gone and I started cramming for an exam less than.8 hours away...

come exam time, by this point the full force of the 5 pills was on me
being agitated and highly hydrated I had to go to the bathroom every 15 mins(gave the supervisprs a hell of a time)...but by god when that exam was over and I was on my way home
the worst 6 7 hours began as I began to come down..heart beating out of my chest,  throat feels hard to swallow still drinking alot and pissin a shitload more...I hadnt slept so my eyes were killing me.and a hole lot shit more that I DO NOT WANT TO REPEAT.


WHAT I want to know are:

what can I do to lessen my wd symptoms from opium( any drugs? otc or prescription only)

and hoow can I reduce the come down for methylphenidate? I kno benzos work great but again I am kinda weary on that subject...",1418195232.0

I've always used opiates, since I was about 16, but never been completely physically dependent on them in the ""sweaty withdrawls if I go too long"" kind of way.

About 2.5 years ago I moved to a Metro area, having Methadone and MSContins as my previous DOC simply because of availability (having a cancer patient as a friend helped).  During my time there I tried H for the first time (smoked, snort, was some OK east cost shit, I think, I just got overcharged for it -- still don't have the balls to bang it) and enjoyed it but was honestly disappointed (see prev. statement on not having the balls to bang it).  

My source was an an ex-H addict, that introduced me to Suboxone -- something I had never heard of for rec. use -- and I fucking loved it.  It seemed to give me a cheery uplift for an easy 24-36 hours after usage.

My usual routine was taking 1/8 of the 8mg strips (yes, a fucking eighth, I'm a bitch, ok) during the weeknights and a 1/4 or 1/2 on the weekends (enough to give me a nod).  But my main point I'm driving home is after taking an 1/8th I was genuinely more happy with my life, but not really intoxicated.  Can we say, antidepressant?  .. I would always follow my rules and back off if I took them for more then 4-5 days in a row and give myself a cool-down period to stave off hard physical dependency.. But even still, I was just a happier person.

Now, four months ago I moved back to middle of nowhere, and now I'm getting Roxi30's (occasionally percs, eww, Tylenol) and quite honestly they fucking suck!  They get me high for what, 2 hours?  And then I'm sober.  Back to feeling the way I did before.  I'd have to have 20 of these things to make them equiv to a good sub high.  I'd rather have my subs. 

Also a weird thing, ... Subs always made me a morning person.  I went to sleep at normal hour and was up at 6AM making pancakes for the kids, kind of morning person.  No other opiate has ever done that to me.

Am I crazy?  Weird?  Stupid?  I realize subs have a ceiling effect and don't work well for high tolerance individuals so maybe that's where I found my sweet spot with Subs.  But I'd kill to be able to go to a Dr and say ""Give me subs -- for -- depression""

Last Friday i ordered three 8mg Hydromorphone pills from a DNM so I could finally experience the legendarily intense rush of an IV Dillie for the first time.
As a backup though (I am shitty with trying to bang pills and have a record of 0-5 so i also bought a quarter gram of the old Peruvian rowdy powder just incase so could try my first ever *proper* speedball as a fall back.

Woke up this afternoon almost shaking with anticipation, to find that only one package has shown up. Fortunately it turns out I ordered both from the same vendor so when I open the jiffy bag  3 foil-sealed Dillies and a neatly packaged, pretty looking little block of some fine looking Cocaine fall out on to my bed. 

By this point I am fucking *stoked*. I've never done Dillies or Speedballs properly before and, along with *maybe* one off tryouts of Meth and Mescaline, they are 2 of the last handful of drugs left on my ""try before I die/quit"" list. 

Basically after I get through this one remaining speedball and buy some suitable - see rest of story - Dilaudid to do it properly I'm fully committing to my Bupe maintenance program, tapering after Christmas and mid-year assignments are handed in, all with the intention of  being clean *AT LEAST* by my birthday in April.

So It's early and I've just got up and I've been on Subs for a few weeks now (though in anticipation I missed the maximum number of days in a row the pharmacy will allow so that I'm not wasting my shit) and have no dope to hand as a result, but I have a  bag of brand new needles, cups with cottons, sterile water, the works and so I decide Dillies first it is (and besides, I was most stoked for them anyway.

So I pop open my first pill, genuinely trembling with scumbag excitement and BAM, they're fucking pink.

Coated

Fucking

Extended

Release

So after a spot of panic googling, snorting a crushed one to guage the effect and a bunch of mental back-and-forth considering if it was worth trying to get them to IV anyway, weighing up the cons of potential vein-wrecking and drug wasting vs the potential pros of the mythical fuckin Dillie rush, I settle on at least giging it a go.

Long story sort it's totally fruitless; all I have to show for it is a bruise on my forearm and a £20 dent in my already dangerously low finances (but I guess on the bright side £20 isn't too bad for 24mg of Hydromorphone, right?)

So now it's backup plan time: speedballz.

Call up my boy, he's live, so I excitably half-jog down to meet him, score 3 bags (I'm low on funds til mid January and since I'm planning on a taper-to-quit I figure I'd better keep it simple.)

The anticipation on the way back home made the walk unbearable, but I finally get home after a 25 minute jog-run that felt like 5 hours, leg it upstairs, cook up a nice shot, strike gold with a nice vein (believe me, this is super rare; my veins are like invisible, tiny little threads of cotton that hide so deep Anne Frank would have been proud) and register.

But then I hesitate; what if I used too much cham? Iv'e never cooked up a SB before, and if it killed Belushi then do I even stand a chance?
Fuck it, I have a day off college and no money to get high for a while, this is IT son.

SO bam, in goes the plunger, couple seconds of ""huh, this isn't great, maybe I did..... HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FUCK""

Now I feel like the motherfucking goddamned King of the Universe and my whole body is tingling.

There's even feeling back in my wang after a year of severe dope-dick.

Then, as a sweet, beautiful topper, I go to stash the leftovers in a drawer and find all this that I put there and forgot after being b.asted on Flubromazepam last week:

I have for a while, and after putting off getting new tires waaay too long I finally spun out into a street sign the other night. Fucked up my passenger side front wheel.

There's a walgreens near me that has lope, but I've already 'procured' from them several times so I really don't know about that. Tbh it's probably what I'm gonna have to do anyway.

But I was wondering if anyone else had times where they relied on a car/automobile and suddenly didn't have access to one. What did you do? C/T? Walk 50 miles to get right?

This goes out to, SoberDreams, RustyGuns and all you other hateful shit patrollers on this sub just like you. I made a comment when I was nodding that didn't make a lot of sense, I understand the confusion but I was just stating an opinion. If you don't like, cool, down vote my comment, I don't care about points on the internet that will NEVER translate into anything that matters.      
      
&nbsp;
                  
But insulting me and telling me to get off the sub? Who do you think you are? The opiate sub police? I notice this shit a lot on here and even to attack people on here for not being ""as much of a junkie"" as some of you are. That's so fucking childish. We're all here because we like ops and we like talking about the lifestyle that comes with the addiction.

 So stop being so childish. Does anyone else notice how bad this has gotten? Here's an example... I posted an opinion earlier while I was nodding and it came out like you think it would, incoherent and stupid looking but is this really necessary?

TL;DR, stop being childish shit sticks and stop taking this sub so seriously guys. I thought the whole point of the sub was to have fun, keep informed and nod out together, not make this into a full-time - part-time junkie thing. I saw it happen yesterday, a guy got mass down voted because he was complaining about coming off of a point a day or some small amount like that, so the fuck what if he doesn't bang a half gram a day, he's still just as welcome to post here and to fucking complain about his wd's. I wish some of guys would go to prison and try that shit, see how long you last. (Some of you already know / Some of you don't so I'll just clear any confusion so I don't get told to leave the fucking sub again) I just got done serving time for a pharmacy robbery.

If you can't take an L when you took the risk in this game, then you shouldn't be in the game and it's time you seek help to get out.

I say this because not only are you facing the risk of jail, if you open your big fat mouth, you're running the risk of getting your ass severely beaten, house calls (where them boys show up to your crib...and yes...it does happen), them boys threatening your family,  your girl, your kids, or it could end worse for you.

Bottom line is: Really know what you're getting yourself into before you jump in with both feet. Don't talk that, ""I'd never snitch"" shit, when you're a bitch at heart.

The game ain't for everybody. Just be honest with yourself.

Before you make the decision to get in the game, go into a daydream-like state and pretend you're cuffed, leaning against the hood of the cop car, and he's asking you where you got your shit. If you can't see yourself taking the L like you should, then just stay out.

I say this because not everyone will overlook shit. Never underestimate someone. You don't know why they hustle and who they're hustling for. It may very well be a life or death situation for them and let me tell you, if you take that man or woman away from his hustle, it could end up being a very dangerous situation.

They owed me 2 oz(25$ an hour or one quarter oz an hour) for 8 hours work today but I said fuck it and took $200 cash and said get me the oz ASAP.

I work again on the 22nd so it's cool. I don't want to run around I want to enjot the holidays- and buy dope. So I just got a half gram and the weird thing is the points seemed to be light brown h but the shit i got tonight looks like the bright white chunks I had recently. oh lucky day. I'm so happy.

And instead of just spending it all on dope I'm finally going to throw down the cash for a bunch of jars, new plastic lids & grains and grow mushrooms again like friends and even some family keep poking me to do.

Maybe they're sick of me always pointing out that I don't have enough money.

Listening to my boss talk about so and so owes ""14 large"" and all these debts and transactions I felt like should i do something, anything on the side to give myself more stability? i mean how lazy am I? I used to love growing shrooms. and sure it was just a bit of extra cash but when you're near broke and suddenly you're shopping with $50 and you know you produced a wonderful product and sell it fairly-cracker dry and always a little overweight-IT FEELS GOOD.

When I woke up I had no idea what I was in for. 

Later in the day I met up with a friend. He  was trying to score some tar. Time and time again his people said no, they were dry, on the way to reup. But finally he found someone. And bought a dub

When we got back to the spot, he pulls out some foil, a straw and a lighter. I watched him place the small black ball on the foil and take a hit. He seemed to hold it in forever and then exhale. He handed it to me, and it was my turn.

I held the flame under the foil. The black ball slid across the shiny metal surface. Leaving behind a trail of burnt black goo. While I inhaled it tasted bitter, I didn't care. I held it in then exhaled. 

I repeated this process three more times. Then just sat there. My body felt like it was beginning to float. I was covered in warmth. I had none of my emotional pain. Physically I couldn't feel my body. It was paradisiacal. I never want to stop feeling like this. I never want to hurt again. I've finally found a love, and it's Heroin. 


Outside of this little narrative I wrote I hope I never pay for this drug. It's too amazing to use daily like marijuana. I'm playing a dangerous game. More-so than what it is with oxycodone.

I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who reached out to me and update y'all on my situation.

I've been an iv drug user since I was a teenager (27 now) and thus have been dope sick countless times, but methadone withdrawals is hands down the worst pain I have ever dealt with in my life. I had always heard how horrid it was, but I didn't know how bad till I was there myself.

 Needless to say, I dragged my ass back to the clinic on Monday. I had to be back at work Tuesday after a little over a week off, and there's absolutely no way that would've been possible had I not went back. For those of you who have quit this shit cold turkey, I truly don't know how the fuck you did it and am honestly amazed by you. 

Being off of it for a week though did allow me to go from 120 mg daily to 40 mg a day currently. I plan to taper off of the 40 slowly and comfortably. I wish I could've completed my goal and gotten off of it completely, but I feel ok that I at least dropped 80 mg in a week.

I was using about a half gram of good dope IV everyday for the past year. Recently I got a new girlfriend who wasn't into me using. Things were great and i began to cut back some. Despite knowing that i was still using some she stayed with me for 2 months. Then about a week ago she let me know that we had to split up and i needed to take some time to sort myself out and that she would consider returning once i was clean. 
Luckily I had bought 800pack of lope off of amazon for very cheap. The day after she left i went out with one last bang. The next day i cleared my bowels and dosed with about 80mg Lope. I felt great all the way through til the next day. Then day two when i would have definitely been in full WD I took a smaller dose of about 40mg. I began to notice very quickly that I felt HIGH. And i'm not talking about placebo effect, i'm talking about feeling like i had done a good shot an hour previous. I was itchy, euphoric and calm. It was wonderful. Since then i've  been dosing according to how i feel that day in 20mg intervals (10 small pills at a time). And now 5 days later I have managed to not take lope long enough to have a bowel movement, which i will say was not the most pleasant but still this is far greater than experiencing full on WD. I took a 2mg klonopin and i felt the greatest i have felt in a long time, even during my heavy using. Lope is a miracle drug, and at the right dose it is possible to get high off of it. I even had suboxone at my disposal and opted for the lope instead, It's far more enjoyable for me than Bupe. 
Has anyone else experienced similar results? I wish i had known about this long ago. 
Anyways I hope this helps someone, and if you have any questions for me I'll be happy to answer. I haven't stopped taking the lope fully yet and am curious if i will experience WD once i do (tho i am weaning off). If anyone has information about that I'd much appreciate some advice. 
In summation, Lope is far far cheaper than any other drug, it's legal, and no one has ever OD'd from it. It works wonders for WDs and it's really all about finding the dose you need for what you're trying to accomplish. For maintenance I think 20-40mg and to get through the first few days 60-100mg (i'm a 180lbs. so this would very person to person) I think i've found a happy alternative to heroin.  
Hints: -make sure to clear yourself out and take it on an empty stomach with grapefruit juice 
-do not eat much while on high doses (ive been eating some fruit and vegtables in small portions)
- Drink lots of water because it tends to dehydrate
-DO NOT buy from a pharmacy, they are far far overpriced and not worth the money. (i recommend the kirkland brand off of amazon)
-DO NOT take a crazy dose like 200mg, you might shrivel up from the dehydration and who knows if you'll ever have a poop again

Thanks for reading, i look forward to hearing your opinions on this.

It is just to give an alternate view to the overwhelming view that daily opiate use will destroy your life.

Before I ever touched an opiate or any other drug my life was an absolute mess, and I was plagued with mental health problems. I dropped out of school in middle school, my parents paid for expensive psychiatrists that RXed tricyclic and SSRI antidepressants that made me worse, and antipsychotics that made me a drooling zombie. I had no life, and considered suicide often, I had no motivation to do anything.

Then I tried codeine on a whim, one of the few drugs I had tried at the time. And whoa it was nice, but too short lasting. Found out about PST and pods, and HOLY SHIT! It was amazing I said where has this been my whole life, they turned me into a different person, and for under $5 bucks a day. This period was like an awakening to life to me after a lifetime of mental fog, there was so much to enjoy in life food, music, people. I could finally socialize and have normal relationships.

Eventually pods became unavailable, a sad day since they remain my favorite with PST and other forms of opium a second. I could dose 2-3 pods a day and be fine all day with no desire to raise the dose.

I eventually found buprenorphine was good as well.

I've tried every opiate/opioid under the sun almost except the rarities and I think my least fav was fent, too sedating and far too short half life. I want to dose once a day and forget it and hate nodding, I have a life.

I have IVed on special occasions but I find it sort of annoying because even with perfect hygiene(I mean medical grade) I still got a small infection once, too much trouble.

After I started using opiates daily I got out of my hole, went back to school and built a life and am married with a kid. I'm on 1-2mg of bupe a day now, but switch around some as I find it helps. My spouse wants me on it, I feel strongly that the me on opiates in the REAL me and my old self was crippled.

I once tried going off, made it to six months and I was researching suicide methods online and doing crazy dangerous shit when I said NO and made a decision to get back on and stay on for life. I was instantly back to a stable state.

I've been on opiates for nearly daily for pretty much half my life, and totally intend to stay on until I die. They turned my life around and saved me from a sad end. My dose has not escalated, I have not gone on a downward spiral. 

My favorite opiates are PST/pods/opium and buprenorphine and methadone, I like stuff that is energetic and with a long half life. I don't like nodding I find it boring as hell.

I DO NOT consider myself better or superior to any other user or addict, I do consider myself an addict as I cannot function in life without.

One of the things that my sleep report mentioned was that ""sedatives"" should be avoided including alcohol. I recently even tried to get klonopin from my doctor (for legitimate health reasons, not to get high) and he wouldn't give it to me because he said he's not supposed to give people with breathing issues a drug like that. I guess that makes sense, but ugh.

So...what's the deal with opiates and sleep apnea? After some googling around it looks like opiates can cause central sleep apnea (where your brain stops sending the right signals to breath during sleep). But what about with OBSTRUCTIVE sleep apnea (where the airway closes during sleep)? I'm guessing opiates don't help with OSA, but how bad is it really? 

Does anyone have any experience with using opiates when having OSA? When you're on and off treatment? Surely some of you do. And what about alcohol? Surely everyone who has OSA doesn't also swear off drinking?

It seems like my sleep is just as shitty as ever whether I'm taking opiates or not but I'm worried now that I'm killing brain cells when I sleep every time I take opiates. ):

I smashed them up reasonably, not completely to powder, but that would be a bit hard, I mixed this in with 4 mL water in a shot glass. There were large pieces not dissolved just sitting at the bottom so I took the syringe base and smashed it down and swirled to try to get it to dissolve a bit better. I sucked up as much as I could get with an oral syringe (probably at least 95% of it) and squirted it in me bum. It started to hit about 10 minutes in but it's not very intense in the least, just a nice medium opioid high. However I did do a good amount of quality ECH last weekend (100-150 mg) with no prior tolerance so that could be playing a role. I know in general the bioavailability of hydromorphone is shit orally, nasally, and rectally and you're supposed to IV them if you really want the experience, but everyone has told me this is the best opioid rush out there and the surest way to get hooked, plus I can't do needles, so was plugging my best option? Did I do my best in preparation of the solution and plugging it? I think so, don't know how it could've been much better, perhaps I should've just done 12 mg or more. Thanks for any tips or words on this, seems Dilaudid is something I should just not mess with because the only way to have it really be worth it is to IV it, which I'm not going to do. To me, H is the best opioid because you can completely control dose, do as much or as little as you want and maintain the high for a long ass time, plus the nods are unbelievable, I would've had to do at least 12 mg of the Dilaudid rectally ($30 from the markets) to get to nod territory at all, which I could get way more value for H and a better high",1418455402.0

I'm not here to bust anyone's balls or anything. One of the things that I wasn't expecting was that I actually gained a lot of compassion for the average addict; reading what some have you have gone through and how you've ended up here as an opiate addict allows me to have more insight  into your lives than a normal interaction that I would have with any of you on the street. 


One of my biggest questions is why I've read so many comments that read something similar to ""fuckin cops"" when someone's gotten locked  up or stopped for some reason. You guys (and us guys) all know that it's a game. Sometimes we win and sometimes you win.  There was one recent post where a dude got his car searched and the cop missed a gram - good for you!  You won that day.  Sometimes we get you when you just left your dope spot and we get your dope and your works - we won that day - good for us! 


Another question - why so much hate towards pharmacies that won't sell you sticks?  They don't want to sell it to you because they know what you're going to do with it.  Same reason we do mental health checks on people before they buy a gun - wouldn't want to sell a gun to someone who we know is suicidal. I understand the harm reduction part of it, but you've gotta understand the pharmacy's point of view too, right? I admit it's a shitty position for both the addict and the pharmacy; I don't know what the solution is. 


Also, please don't ask me why some cops are dicks.  Some just are. Just like some of you are dicks. I show respect to addicts I come across, but I do my job too - Make no mistakes...I wanna find your dope/gear and make an arrest.


I wouldn't mind dope addicts so much if we didn't have so many around my area that are breaking into people's houses and robbing them blind!




Edit: that's all I got left in me tonight. 


To recap - fresh needles for all!  Decriminalize that shit.   It's not a game. 


Seriously, thanks for all of you who took the time to talk to me, even though in most other settings you would hate me. You all seem very intelligent and I honestly hope you guys all achieve whatever it is you want in life.  The hardest step is the first step.  ",1418418936.0

To inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this chapter.

A)Any knowledge about how long it would take for police to obtain a warrant for someone that they thought may be distributing narcotics? (In this whole question I'm just referring to a person's residence not the actual persons or their vehicles ) and who actually has to sign the warrant? 

B) would they need evidence to get a warrant? Ie video surveillance, eye witness, formal verbal complaints etc or maybe even all of the above? Or can police just be like ""Fuck there's always mad people at that fucking house and they look sketchy as Fuck... Let me get a warrant real quick""

C) do police ever search homes/apartments without the proper documentation to do so? If so and evidence is found, is this evidence automatically thrown out in court like I have seen in movies and tv shows etc.

D)if a police officer comes to your home with a warrant can you demand to read it before they enter so that way you can verify that they do In fact have the right to ransack your apartment ?

E) does it happen more with certain types of drugs? I see a lot of mostly weed busts on the news which I assume is because of the heat from plants being seen by police helicopters making it easy to obtain a warrant. Along with weed I see a lot of meth dealers going down. I assume this is because they are cooking in sketchy places though (ie in my hometown a Wal-Mart parking lot-with kids in the Damn car (no excuse after watching breaking bad), and a staples (breaking bad again).heroin busts are definitely more prevalrnt now that it's on the rise too, but opiate pillst I have only hear about one or two busts in the 8 years I've been using opiates. Is this because police have more funding to go after ""harder narcotics"" or is it just the luck of the draw. What I mean by that is so they get the Same funding for everyone but they catch the harder drugs because they're more prominent/those types of drugs have dealers who slip up more

Finally does anyone have any good stories about a raid? Some osama bin Laden type Shit where the police fly a helicopter in, barrel roll off the chopper onto the roof, smash out the Windows, throw concussion grenades, put all the naked bitches weighing out Yayoo on their faces, get in a shootout with the cops , everyone dies except main dude and he gets arrdstdd with 248 million kilos? Share your stories ! Lol

I was just wondering because you always see this happening in movies. Cops get a warrant signed that day and then BOOM!!! doors kicked In and dealers are going down!I've known a ton of dealers (some bigger than others obviously) and none of them have evver got their doors busted in and got searched. 

TLDR; drug raids on dealers houses on tv are epic but do they even happen as frequently as they are portrayed on tv in real life?",1418561624.0

So, 5 days ago, my dealer was on his way back from picking up, he has a 2 and a half hour drive to go to the city and get his stuff. Later that day he texts me and tells me to start heading to his place so I can get stuff from him, takes a half hour to get to his place. So I go there and call and nothing... call and nothing... call and nothing, I wait there for an hour before giving up and heading home. I never hear from him. The next day I call and call and nothing! All day. I talk to one of my friends who picks up from him and the exact same thing happened to her, she got told to go see him and he never responded after that. But my friend talked to my dealers wife and she said that my dealer wasnt answering her(wifes) phone calls either. So every day since then we have been calling him but he has not been answering. Like what the fuck happened? 


BUT today, we finally get a call from him, but we didnt answer because right before we got that call my friend (girl who also picks up from him) sent us a text that said she is worrying that our dealer got busted and if we answer his phone calls the cops will be listening in or something and we will get stung by cops if we try to go pick up from him. Dealer asked my friend to go meet him right away. But dealer only told my friend to go meet him, thats all he said, he didn't and wouldn't say what happened to him or if everything was cool, he said he would only talk in person... So... we think he got busted and now he wants us to come to his place and the cops are going to be waiting there.


My questions are, what do you guys think? Has anyone had a similar experience? Would cops really bother to set up a sting down the drug ladder rather than up? My gf thinks so but I dont think the cops would bother to sting a dealers clients rather than his supplier.


Tl;dr: Drug dealer dissapeared for 5 days, contacts me today finally. He wouldnt tell us what happened but said we have to meet up ASAP. But we are worried he got busted and we would walk into a sting if we go meet him. What do you think?",1418524238.0

Legal Narcotics In A Liberal City
http://www.economist.com/

THE people queuing up at the Providence Crosstown Clinic are pioneers of a sort.  They are heroin addicts whose habits have resisted conventional treatment.  They hope to become the first in North America to get their fixes legally as part of a treatment programme rather than just for a clinical trial.  ""It's heroin that you know is good,"" says one addict waiting outside, who aspires to join the queue.

Some European countries, including Germany and Switzerland, prescribe heroin for the most severe cases of addiction.  Patients taking heroin are less likely to use illicit drugs and drop out of treatment than those who use methadone, a substitute.  Vancouver's eagerness to follow is not surprising.  It has long had Canada's most liberal drug policies, and it has a big problem.  Addicts congregate in Downtown Eastside, two derelict blocks right next to tourist attractions and the financial district.  In the late 1990s the city had the highest rate of HIV infection outside sub-Saharan Africa.

Across the street from the Crosstown clinic is one where addicts can take drugs they buy off the street under supervision of the health authorities.  But that does not guarantee safety.  In October 31 people fell ill from a bad batch of street heroin.  The Crosstown clinic, by contrast, is prescribing top-quality stuff-diacetylmorphine made in Switzerland-to 120 people whose addictions are tenacious enough to warrant the treatment.

The hope is that they will take safer drugs, lead more regular lives and eventually move to methadone.  For some, the alternative is ""to inject in an alley using heroin that they didn't know for certain where it came from,"" said Scott MacDonald, a doctor at the clinic.  ""This has become the only choice.""

The federal government, which has jurisdiction over drugs policy, disagrees.  It wants to deny the exemption for research under which the drugs are being administered.  Giving addicts ""the very drugs they are addicted to"" does not help them, says Rona Ambrose, the health minister in the Conservative government.  A group of addicts took the matter to British Columbia's Supreme Court and won a judgment that to withhold treatment might cause ""irreparable"" harm.  The programme, which had been interrupted, resumed on November 27th under the court's protection.

But the ruling has force only until Canada's Supreme Court weighs in on the case, which is expected to happen in 2016.  Until then, addicts will find relief at the Crosstown clinic up to three times a day.  One woman has been trying to break the habit for nine years but the struggle feels as if it has been going on ""for 90 years at least"".  For a while, that struggle will be a bit safer.

I'm standing there pumping gas, and a guy comes up to me saying:

""Hey sir, I'm a disabled veteran and I need some money for gas. Do you think you could spare some change?"" I tell him that all I have is a debit card, which is not true. He rolls his eyes at this point and is about to drive off. However, I tell him I will be happy to go inside and put $20 on a pump for him to get some gas with - as this is the only way I could get him gas with my ""Debit Card.""

He then proceeds to scoff at me, tell me I have no respect for my elders, and that I need a good ""ass-whooping,"" and he felt right in the mood to about give me one right there. 

I say to him, ""Well sir, with all due respect, you are acting like a completely ungracious fool. And, to be quite honest, I wouldn't ever hand you cash. I know you aren't going to use it for gas. You are going to buy some type of drugs. If you were using it for gas, then you would have been *MORE* than happy to let me put $20 on a pump for you to get gas with.

I've been on mmt since this past july. I seriously credit it to saving my life. I had tried numerous times to get clean. cold turkey, 5 day hospital detoxes, suboxone tapers. I never lasted more than a day. even after the physical aspects faded, I felt such a serious depression that I just couldn't get past. maybe I'm a weak person, I don't know. but I just felt there was NO point of living without heroin. when I got on methadone, it I guess satisfied my opiate receptors without getting me high and I almost automatically became a happy and motivated person. I even feel like it made me a better person than I was BEFORE I even started opiates.

in the beginning, and for the first few months I had zero cravings for any opiates. starting in maybe october, I started getting some. sometimes they're just slight thoughts, like ""I could go for a bag right now."" other times, like tonight, it's really strong.

what makes it worse, and more tempting, is that I have thousands of dollars in the bank now from working and hustling and actually saving that money and not having to spend it on dope everyday. so I know I could go cop any time I wanted to. however I always stop myself and tell myself it's NOT worth it, not worth risking fucking up the life I've just started to make for myself. and that's the truth. it's not worth it. I usually curb my cravings by eating something sweet (and I wonder why I've put on 15 lbs since starting mmt...) or getting a mani/pedi or buying myself something.

but sometimes it feels so strong, like tonight. I saw my brother running around doing the whole hustle thing and then he finally got his money up and was just so excited because he knew he was finally going to get high. I really missed that. not just the feeling of getting high but the whole lifestyle, and everything. sometimes I can even almost physically feel the rush I would get from shooting up. I miss it a lot when I get cravings like this. it almost feels like a physical craving, weirdly enough.

**some people have told me that cravings mean I should go higher on my methadone dosage at the clinic (I'm on 80mg currently) and that cravings like this shouldn't be happening while I'm on methadone .. ""that's the whole point of being on it"", I've been told. other people tell me that methadone has done its part, it can only do so much and these cravings are a part of life and I just need to learn to deal with them and that going higher isn't going to do much.**

I also go to meetings, maybe 2-3x a week. I don't feel too comfortable there just because the people I have met in NA are very, very anti-methadone maintenance but I go because the meetings do put me in a good head space.

Other states are passing very strict laws making it extremely difficult for doctors to prescribe opiates to people. In Ohio, a certain law is making it more difficult for cancer patients to be prescribed an opiate painkiller. Here is a link to an article that explains the several (10 total) laws the Republican led Ohio state Congress is trying to pass. 

http://m.toledoblade.com/Featured-Editorial-Home/2014/04/13/The-politics-of-addiction.html

These are all bills passed by the Republican majority House, and is heading to the Republican majority Senate. Once passed there it will head to the Republican Governor desk, John Kasich. So obviously there won't be any stopping these draconian laws.

The media, law enforcement, and politicians are so stupid if they think these laws will stop opiate abuse. What will happen is most people will become desperate and be pushed onto heroin. Whatever prescription opiates are left on the streets will go WAY UP IN PRICE. 

But I don't think the politicians are really trying to stop the problem. I think they want MORE desperate addicts on heroin, causing more crime and filling up more jails and prisons. I hope I'm not the only person on this sub that follows policies and laws that affect me. It might just be Ohio right now, I haven't checked other states. But Republicans made huge gains in state governments all over the country in this past election. I'm not a huge fan of the Democrat party, but I would never vote Republican because these are they type of changes they will try to make. I imagine they will start attacking medical and recreational marijuana soon. 

So for anyone here that is still fooled that any Republican in office is good for you, well you need to open your eyes. Republicans claim they want to cut government, but really the only thing they want to cut is welfare and food stamps (which are a drop in the bucket of government spending if you didnt know). Republicans talk about freedom, and personal responsibility but they are the first to condemn drug use and marijuana legalization. Republicans want a ""free market"" but they have used their political clout to pass laws to kill private internet gaming and gambling cafes, so they could protect their friends in the BIG  casinos.

Please friends don't be fooled! Research who you vote for, check out the Green party or other alternative parties. You'll see that there platforms are more aligned with the things YOU want.",1418588761.0

They were pretty cool actually and I'm planning on using that route again.

Anyway, moving ahead to the advice part: I met this chick on saturday at a holiday market we work at. We really clicked for the 8 hrs she was there (I was there 12, sprained my ankle in the last 20 seconds of the shift, am on crutches now fml). This chick is a dime, graduating with her masters this thursday, doesn't do any drugs, drinks from time to time blah blah.. I know I like her a lot already, and then while chillin on Saturday at the market my friend asked if she was still dating anyone, turns out shes dating a 22 year old undergrad. Meanwhile she's 27. I just turned 25. That kinda blew me, because I know I like her already, but whatever.

Advice part: me and her have been talking/texting non stop since saturday pretty much, and she throws a real curveball at me. She wants to go to meetings with me to help me get ""sober"". I find this a little strange and straight up ask her up why she wants to give up her time to someone she just met and go to drug meetings where she can't really relate, and she says that ""she thinks i'm neat, and wants to be friends with me"" but I guess I should say it took her more than a couple minutes to say that response.

So what do you think I should do? I kinda left it at alright, that's really nice of you, she seems real down and excited to go but I don't want to be taken here as ""a friend"" while going through this extremely emotional/mentally tough task of getting clean. Especially if I know I already dig this girl a lot and can't really ""lean on her"" if you know what I mea.. That would fuck with me really bad, it already has.

I'm currently on about a 20g/month ECP habit, give or take some extra grams, but this month I had to cut back a little bit for the holidays due to doing something really special for my girlfriend that costed me half of my soul and a contract that states I must give up my firstborn child, etc. (surprise engagement vacation in NZ lol) 





Anyways, I'll try to sum this up. I'm doing about .75/g a day, well I ran out and stocked up on Loperamide, which I have a pretty decent tolerance to due to my recent dope shortages. 




Started with 40mg, wasn't cutting it so I took an additional 30mg on Friday. Saturday I said fuck it, let's make it an even number, so I took 100mg, and (foolishly) 120mg on Sunday. 





Sunday night rolls around and I start feeling extremely nauseous, I take a shower, go outside to smoke a cigarette and projectile vomit all over the ground, followed by about 3 more vomits and some dry heaving. 





Today rolls around (mind you I didn't take any lope today. lol) and I start the day off throwing up, followed by more dry heaving. It's now 12:15AM and I'm still throwing my guts up.

Long read, appreciate some logical advice. Young opiate lover who still isn't over it.","This is a long read, but I'd appreciate some advice from you guys, as I am sure some of you can relate to my experience.

Hello. I am in my early twenties, currently working and going to school. I almost have my bachelors in music study. I am a good kid, come from a good family, just make bad decisions. I have suffered from severe anxiety and depression ever since I was around 16 years old, and since then been exploring drugs. I am fascinated by them to be honest and although I want to be drug-free completely someday, I still want to enjoy it for a bit longer... 

The main reason for my depression stems from my lack of a healthy social life. My social anxiety, that was exasperated by frequent MDMA/psychedelic/marijuana binges, prevented me making friends. I also played many MMORPGS like Maple Story growing up... which also prob prevented me from experiencing development that would be considered ""normal"" for other kids.

I have done mostly all the drugs, except the RCs and whatnot. My favorite and most therapeutic drug was MDMA. I loved it, had a tremendous afterglow after my first time, and my social anxiety was permanently lowered. I however abuse led to more anxiety. The abuse is for several reasons. After my first roll, I was desperate to do it again and have that ""perfect rave experience"" where I would meet some beautiful rave princess and we would both be rolling and become best friends. This sounds pathetic, but I have zero game with girls, never even had a girlfriend. A lot of that is on me though as I am too much of a pussy to put the effort in... and since I was never able to attain a girlfriend/be proactively social with females sober this never happened.

For the past few years, I have been abusing opiates, my new drug of choice, on and off. Not so much as a crutch for my anxiety (as it does do wonders tho for that too), but for an escape from the mundane life I live in. I feel like I started doing heroin during the end of high school. I went straight to heroin... 

I did end up doing other opiates too though later. During early 2012, I got clean, and went on a suboxone maintenance program. I was prescribed an EXCESS strips a month for two years, and this has been working out well for me. I do not take it all though and have a shitload of a stockpile... still don't know what to do with that as I only take 4mg when I'm prescribed 16mg a day. My insurance covered it so I figure why not have some extra? Recently, I relapsed two months ago. Life was going good. I was clean for over 1.5 years, seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, and was slowly moving away from the heroin temptation. The sub kept me right, I didn't get high (well I did during the honeymoon phase which felt like an amazing antidepressant... still does imo but not to the extent when I started my sub maintenance) and gave me energy to do things. I am also prescribed Xanax XR which I only take when necessary, and also dexedrine for energy. I have very low energy, and these help tremendously. I was doing great! I was able to be more social, etc, basically healthier me mentally and physically.

Anyways... I was starting to get a bit tired of my job, school, and everything. Although I was making progress, I still lacked any healthy social life, and I was feeling nostalgic for that warm heroin high again... I was simply thinking ""you know what, I am going to relapse eventually probably so why not do it now? Plus, I could use a mental vacation and I am curious to go back to that warm opiate blanket"". I waited 24 hours after my last 4mg, and I was able to get high. Mind you it took a little more than necessary, but I got that feeling back. 

I continued using for a month... everyday.... and went back to sub 12 hours after my last Heroin dose. I took 8mg and felt fine physically, minus the psychological craving back in full force.... since I have a plethora of sub, I figured why not just use more since I have this as a safety net? Horrible idea... and I ended up back into a full blown addiction. After taking the sub I went back to H immediately the next day lol... 

Well some changes happened. Firstly, my parents started to notice. Straws and powder on my dashboard....lots of signs... I looked skinnier, baggy eyes... I told them I relapsed, and I felt horrible. I absolutely hate having to put my parents through the pain of knowing their son is a drug addict. I told my parents I would stop and go back on the sub, and would throw the remaining stamps out... I tried, but I couldn't, and continued using for 3 weeks. I felt like I NEEDED the heroin. Even if it meant cutting up a line was going to make me get to work late, I felt like a better person. Life was easier for me on it, or at least in my perspective. However, the pain I was causing my parents is the worst. I don't like them worrying about me. They know it leads down a road to nowhere and so do I, yet why do I crave it so much. I decided enough was enough and went back on sub last week. Luckily they still support me but won't if I tell them I'm using again... 

I've been taking 4mg sub daily for the past week, taking some more xanax than usual but it's no big issue for me... (after the second relapse right after that 1-day sub thing lol). I've been looking healthier, and feel absolutely fine. I did not undergo precipitated withdrawal or anything, and it's kind of funny cause the suboxone tolerance feels lowered after my dope binge so I guess I got that going for me...

Now... I told my therapist and psychologist about my relapse. My psychiatrist is a good doctor, he isn't dirty, but he does have a tendency to overprescribe me stuff. He'll ask if I need more first, rather than less.I'm prescribed the sub, benzo, and dexedrine. Extremely grateful, and I don't abuse any of them (maybe the benzos a little during my relapse but it's whatever). 

Since this is all so recent, idk what's going to happen. My psychiatrist wants me to stay on a high dose of sub (which I've been taking the lower amount all this time lol..) to prevent another relapse. He told me when I saw him that I should be on a dose high enough that I am not having the cravings. I am unsure though... taking like 24mg sub I'd still have cravings I bet. 

I will most likely be getting more therapy (which helps a lot), and drug tests. I am not being forced to go to some inpatient program or anything. I am not a fan of 12-step program anyways.

Anyways, I am so far clean from dope again for a week thanks to sub, but I still miss it. I have extremely easy access to it, and I just got word that I can get some extremely cheap roxis and stopsign opanas.... I love oxymorphone maybe even more-so than heroin. I can easily see myself lying and using a couple days before a drug test, and being more discreet about it by using it only once a month/week. Who am I kidding though.... it would make it harder to use since I would be drug tested and it only takes 2-3 days for strong opiates to leave your system.... 

If you got this far, thanks I appreciate you reading... now I want to know if I am making a even bigger mistake now? For me, I don't think my relapse was that big of a fuck-up. I am still in a much better state than I was when I was using heavily nearly 2 years ago. I've still made progress. The problem is, is that if you want to quit heroin you have to do it for yourself. You have to want it. I don't want that and it's sad :( 

See... I don't think I am doing this for myself... I am doing this for the people that love and care about me for their peace of mind rather than me wanting to get clean... I am not happy on heroin, but at least I am content... I feel like I almost put it in a romantic light, since I haven't been able to experience intimacy with another human being I feel like heroin fills that void for me. And now with easy access to heroin everywhere... and now opana (which I also could use as an excuse like ""at least its not heroin""...) I feel tempted. I don't want to hurt my parents anymore though. Even if they don't know and I get away with it I still feel guilty inside. I don't want to lie to them about taking a high suboxone dose either... maybe I should though but man that shit gives me worse constipation than heroin sometimes... What should I do?

**TLDR:Fell in love with dope a while ago... was clean for almost two years on sub maintenance... relapsed two months ago using daily....back on sub now with a week clean from dope. But I miss it, and am not tired of it. I am stopping for the people that are concerned about me, not myself, and if I don't have the true desire to quit I don't think I can keep this up :/**",1418706799.0

But, I've done that, and I always go right back, because ""it's just a mild addiction"", right?

I just sort of want a cheap source for a buzz and not have to deal with the legality anymore.  I can get a small buzz from a 8mg strip.  I usually take just 20-30mg a day of (illict) Roxi.  It would be so nice if I could just wake up and take a strip and not have to deal with picking up for the day.  Even if I didn't catch a buzz, I self-medicated with subs in the past and other than the fact I accidentally percipitated (my spell check won't correct me, gah) W/D'd, I didn't mind being on the subs for a few days.  But it was still illegal and I have a job right now and I don't want to end up in fucking jail over any of it.

Would a sub doctor consider me for treatment?  Should I lie and tell them I'm banging H or just be honest?  I've smoked and snorted H before, and prefer it over OC, but it's just a supply issue.  I have a good job and I keep my shit under wraps, I'm just concerned they're going to try to in-patient me or make me try to take a bunch of counseling I can never attend (demanding job) and then after a short sub treatment end up back with a higher tolerance or some shit.

Unused syringes can fall under ""Intent to use paraphernalia"" depending on certain circumstances.","So I posted a thread a few days ago asking about the legality of unused syringes in florida. If you didn't know anyone over the age of 18 can buy syringes in florida without a prescription. The law states that anything used, or intended to be used to inject a controlled substance is drug paraphernalia. A dirty rig falls under the ""used"" part of the statute while a clean syringe around a packet of heroin falls under ""intended to use"".

Well after talking to a lawyer I found out some more about ""intent to use""


Say you get stopped by the police and have a fresh un opended pack of syringes and no drugs on you. Many people in the previous thread said you would be ok and the syringes would not be paraphernalia.

But do you have track marks? What about a pack of q tips along with sterile and unused cookers? What about a previous charge for drugs?

According to the lawyer I spoke to these factors can be used by law enforcement to show that you ""Intended"" to use the syringes to inject drugs, thus getting you arrested and charged with paraphernalia. 


Also here are some following cases to show that it will uphold in court.

Dabner v. State, 279 N.E.2d 797, 798-99 (Ind. 1972)
(puncture marks over the veins of the defendant’s forearm, evidencing recent injections,
are sufficient to establish intent)



Stevens v. State, 275 N.E.2d 12, 13 (Ind. 1971)
(admission to past drug use coupled with needle marks on defendant’s arms sufficient to
establish intent)

I have been using heroin for seven months, sometimes at a frequency of 5-6 times a week, sometimes at a frequency of twice a month. In other words, I have taken ample breaks in my usage to allow tolerance to go down.

I have recently become a little more engaged with the drug, but took a break last week. This week, my friend and I purchased some dope. My friends said it was excellent, and their eyes were very pinned. It took an entire pea-sized chunk (of the same dope) to get me going. 

Last night I tried again, and it also took me a substantial amount. The rush is no longer as present, and the euphoria no longer as strong.

Like should it be spread apart a few hrs between dope and bupe, or can they be used at the same time, or should subutex be used soley by itself? Also, does not having naloxone in the subutex make the drug more dangerous, as in more prone to OD or something? Can the tablets be used in other ROA's besides oral, such as internasal or IV?

This morning I had something special planned, I had been trying to gather Opana, Dilaudid, lil bit of ECP, and some coke. I was successful. 

I was able to get the 2mg/ml Hydromorphone IV vial for 10 bucks from a old friend. I got 10mg IR 'Panas for $5 each, lucky, I know. And a gram of ECP for 110. 1/4th of coke was like $25. 

I got 10mg of Opana, 10mg of Dilaudid, and 35mg of coke, 50 or so mg of the dope. I used a 10ml syringe for the whole shot, fucker was huge. Attached a 30g half tip needle, and I was good to go. I guess it's good to mention I did a wash on the coke. 

Oh my fucking Jesus Christ oh holy fucking Christ of shit. 

The rush was like nothing else. I had got my BPM around 100 before I did the shot, and it hit me like a train. It was as Kim Jong Un had taken my face and sent 10 bombs and blew them up right next to me. My ears rang harder than ever, and my limbs tingled more and more as I pushed the plunger more.

It's really annoying because I usually get pretty horny if I take smaller amounts -- I guess after larger amounts I just don't care for sex anymore :)  I can get rock hard and have no problems there -- I just cannot finish.

I'm 24/F, west coast of Canada. I'm gonna warn you right now that there isnt much of a point to this post besides the fact that I'm cripplingly lonely, and I feel like this is the only place where I might be able to talk openly amongst like minded people candidly about my life, without the fear of being judged or hated on just because of who I am. I won't take any offense if you choose to stop reading here. Conversely, it would be great to have some new friends to talk to.

Anyways. I digress.

I'm a 20-something year old female, currently residing on the wet west coast of Canada. This year has shit kicked me in ways I didn't know possible. 

My engagement ended in June. Looking back, it was the biggest mistake I almost made, but six months ago, it crushed me. I ended up living at my parents house for the first time in a long time. That lasted 17 hours, before I left again. When I left as a kid, my jaw had been shattered c/o my dad. This time, my nose was broken and I had a black eye. Some things never change.

Good came from it, though, and I wound up crossing paths with my current SO, my best friend who I've known for a decade and been in love with just as long. We spent the summer selling crazy amounts of everything, had it all at our finger tips in infinite supply.

Then I watched the man I love OD. Brought him back. He proposed and I refused, at least, I have for the time being. He's at a year long rehab, and I'm in a new city. For my own protection. For a fresh start.

I don't get to talk to him for another week, but it has all gone to shit for me since he's been gone. His mom owes me $3000. My jo b got outsourced. My ex roomie fucked me over. This all happened within 14 days of moving here. I'm overqualified for retail. Can't get hired.  I'm under qualified in my field. Can't get hired. I've moved 48 times in 5 years. I don't know anyone here. But I'm not giving up.

Not giving up isn't pretty.

I'm working as an escort. I need to come up with $350 for rent on the first. I'm hoping to be able to do that this weekend..but its been slow. I should hate myself for spreading my legs for money but none of the literally hundreds of resumes I've handed out have led to a job yet. Not really many other options for the time being.

I hate this time of year, and this year is hurting me even more than usual with the absence of my SO. My alcoholic mom is off the rails. My abuser dad just had major surgery. I find myself torn between relieved that I have nothing to do with them anymore and angry b that I don't get to have a Norman Rockwell holiday.

I'm also a heroin addict, and I'm grateful for my baggies of sunshine that get me through the dark days. I have no intention of letting dizz go, and I don't want to hear any of the judgment that's undoubtedly being passed down on me. I'm alive right now because I didn't kill myself last week. I didn't kill myself last week because I managed to skirt homeless by paying my rent. I paid the rent by miraculously getting through 3 gross johns in a day (miracle being that I got my $300 the day before I needed it. Like I said, its been slow). I got through by being high.

I relish the relief, the mild reprieve that my down gives me. All things considered, it's the best part of my life right now. I dont feel bad about that in the slightest. I don't drink, never been arrested, never let my habit run my life. 

I'm praying to Junkie Jesus that tomorrow will be kind. I have some seroquel, T3s, adderal and Viagra I'm gonna try to trade for my down fix. Otherwise, I'll have to be dope sick until I get through 4 more johns so that I can pay the rent and have enough left over to cop. Like I said, I don't let my habit get in the way of having a home...but I do try to find creative workaround ways to skirt the sickness. 

I don't know what I was hoping to accomplish with this post but it definitely feels good having some of that off of my chest.

I love microbiology, I got into it when I got into growing mushrooms but I took that interest beyond mushrooms, so when I heard the explanations for heating shots it made sense to me. Sure I know there's bacteria in the air and at every moment those little buggers are floating around and all over surfaces....

But I feel good heating my shots cause I don't know who's been handling that shit before it goes inside me. 

So can we settle this, and does anyone have any links from a medical organization? unless you're the worst kind of conspiracy theorist(all of them) than surely we can trust medical authorities can we not?

I'm not saying we need to be experts to state an opinion or give our take I'm just saying aside from what we all feel and seem to think maybe we can get the official take of a medical organization or scientist with our best interest at heart.

Does anyone have a link like that?

I'm new to IV use, I've been doing it for about a month and I've heated all my shots, not for very long tho sometimes I felt it might have been overkill...would be nice to know it's a waste of time and that I don't need to light a piece of cardboard on the stove when I'm in a pinch and I don't have a lighter, but for now I will continue to heat my shots till I see a good reason not too

I don't find the ""melts the cut in"" argument to be convincing and while I don't know if it's a sound precation without fault I really don't think it hurts more than it harms, I really do wonder if it's protecting me from some injections, but I can't be sure. 

Please read this in full if you are going to disagree with heating shots. 

http://www.heroinhelper.com/user/admin/cold_shot.shtml

I'd be interested to read a well written piece arguing against this take if anyone has one. Thanks. 

Also, maybe we would do an informal poll, put me down for heating my shots,for now.

First off, I wanna start with a little background info on myself and my addiction. My name is Alex and I'm an almost 28 year old male drug addict. I have been addicted to heroin for 13 years though I have been using drugs of all kinds for 18. The first time I went to rehab I was 13 and court mandated to attend inpatient treatment for 6 months. I didn't want to stop using drugs at that time in my life, but I 'faked it to make it' so that I could quickly get home and off of probation. The day my probation ended I smoked a fat blunt with my friends and rolled on X later that night as we had a party to celebrate my freedom. I wasn't ready to stop. As the years went by I stopped using all drugs except for the love of my life, my heroine, heroin. The rush and high of shooting dope was amazing. I didn't need or want anything else. Slowly, then more rapidly, my life began to fall apart. I had lost everything, including some friends that had fatally overdosed, to heroin. I was homeless, broke, and alone. You could say things weren't going well. Again I attended an inpatient program, but this time as a willing participant. Even after I had lost everything I don't think I was ready to completely give up using. I just wanted to get my life back and become a 'functioning addict'. I went through a cycle of using, detox, rehab and back to using many times. At some point I stopped having fun. I went from getting high to using just to feel normal. I'm at the point in my addiction where I want to stop using. About a month ago I sought help for what I *want* and feel to be the last time.

Some of us have heard it before; Institutions, prison or death. That's the way most addictions end. I'm choosing sobriety before one of those three things happens to me *again* and it ends up being permanent. But after multiple attempts at inpatient, outpatient, psych wards, jail, NA, AA, Suboxone, anti-depressants, and pure willpower to quit (with no success), I wasn't sure what to do. I was ready to try anything.

I don't think Methadone is right for everyone nor do I think it's the answer to all my problems, but I am willing to give it a try. So a month ago I walked into a Methadone clinic near me, became a patient and took my first *legal* dose. After starting low and gradually upping to a stable dose of 90mgs, I feel good. Minimal cravings, stability in my mood, less depression and a general sense of hope are great things to have after living a junkie life. The clinic is great in terms of services provided and support, and I feel comfortable talking to my counselor. In the spirit of Tracey and r/opiates, my clinic/Methadone is **reducing the harm** opiates have done to me.

What caused me to create this thread was a meeting I had today with both my parents and my counselor. I wanted to come clean about some of the major lies I had told in the past year or two. I was super nervous before the meeting as I knew the shit was about to hit the fan. It was hell to look my parents, the two who love and support me the most, in the eyes and come clean about my lies and stealing. I put them through hell for 18 years. It was an emotional meeting for all of us. I was surprised when my parents' first words were of thanks and support. Looking back now I shouldn't have been surprised. These two people love their son. When it finished I felt better and as we walked out of the clinic I felt light and... *high*. A literal ton of bricks had been lifted from my shoulders and I was walking on clouds. It felt so good to return the favor to my parents by showing them that this is what I want and that I'm trying. I have hope for a better future for myself and my family.

I want those of you who are thinking they want to get clean to know it can be done. It wont be easy, but it will definitely be worth the effort. Seek help and support. As I have been told, 'You can give up everything for heroin, or give up heroin for everything'. It's cliche but that's because it's true. 

Sorry for the giant post, guys/gals. I just needed to get some of these feelings out of my head and I knew you guys would listen. If you're still reading at this point, **thank you**.

**TL/DR:** My name's Alex and I'm a recovering drug addict. Your addiction can end if you want it to. Be willing to try anything that works. And surprise, surprise, your parents love you no matter how old you are. Thanks.",1418864129.0

Does PST ever go bad?","I've been out of the game for a while; been clean for almost a year. But that doesn't matter cause last Saturday I made a ton of PST. I made many batches, one half pound of seeds at a time. I would make a batch, chug it down, and make another. I was doing it in my car; I didn't want my roommate to know. As I finish up my last batch I pour it all in a bottle of brisk lemonade and I decide to take it up to my room and finish my last dose while watching the Lion King. Anyway it hits me pretty hard. My eyes are pinned tighter than a baby's butt hole, I'm itching, I'm too high to move. I start to nod before I finish my last batch so I leave it on the floor by my bed. A day later I'm still high and it's finals week so I need to buckle down and study. Now today, I'm finishing up my last paper and my semester is over so I decide to chug my neglected batch. Just a few minutes later I feel nauseous and some bad stomach pain. Normally with PST I don't feel anything until atleast an hour later. The PST had a few tiny bean shaped black things floating around in it. My question, does PST ever expire or go bad after being left out too long?",1418860293.0

Struck out at work for the second day in a row. I'm trying to stay optimistic that this weekend will be busy. I need $300 by the 1st. I need 3 men to pay me to pretend that I am not repulsed by both myself and them; them for paying me to spread my legs, and myself for paying the bills by doing so. Besides, I make more money when I keep a smile on my face, on the whole. I only have the one regular who requests a super bitch - I like him the best. I take my rage out on him, he gets off on it. Win win situation - of which there are very few in my current paradigm. 

It's already ten to three in the morning. I am showered and shaven and my alarm clock is set; however, I dipped into the jib I was given in exchange for the use of my lighter earlier today. Junkies, man. Sleep, or amphetamines? Easy choice. I forgot how much I love the high, and hell, I wasn't gonna be sleeping tonight anyways - both insomnia and self-loathing were already winning that battle...and my most profitable days thus far have all been the ones following sleepless nights. Justification of my bad behavior, or ritualism in the hopes of achieving the simple goal of paying the bills? Who knows anymore? Who cares, really? I don't think I do anymore. I haven't in a long time, if I'm being honest. For tonight, I'm choosing to stow the monsters under my bed and ramble on Reddit instead of trying to pretend that sleeping is at all an easy thing to do. I'll post a poem that I wrote a while ago here at some point. It's up for publication soon. I wish that felt like an accomplishment.

I wish I remember what feeling felt like. I wish I could forget the things that haunt me. I wish a lot of things. I have stopped awaiting the magical genie that doesn't exist, and accepted that one of the only truths I know to be absolute is that the things you wish the most to be able to erase from your memory banks will inevitably be the things that harass you the most subconsciously for the rest of your life. Unless, of course, you learn the methods of self-medication that provide even the slightest reprieve. 

My SO is causing a lot of anxiety and depression and stress for me right now, too. It's too complicated to explain at length right now; however, the just of it is that I am starting to wonder if this year long rehab promise was actually a charade, a way to extract me from his life without breaking my heart outright. Again, I am trying to remain optimistic despite overwhelming reason not to; and until I hear otherwise from the horse's mouth, I am choosing to believe that the man I love more than life itself isn't yet another one of the hundreds who have, at this point, broken my heart because they can; because breaking my heart is both easier and more entertaining than loving me, at least, until the day comes when I can do that myself. 

""Love me until I love myself,"" the sweet nothing we used to whisper to each other, the most romantic and poignant promise two people as broken as us could ever have made. Well..I promised, and I meant it. Still do.  Always will. Whether or not he still gives a shit about me, I will forever love that man, more than I have or ever will love myself. I need to switch the topic here because the depression is creeping back in and that, I cannot allow. I must maintain the static and benign headspace I am in, I must stay afloat, I must keep an even keel until the 24th at 12am, when I am forced to take two days off which I can neither afford, nor pretend to give a fuck about. I fucking loathe the holidays. But again - even keel, not tonight. 

Tonight is for survival, and besides the mild reprieve from the various things causing my pupils to pin, survival means being militant with myself, my thoughts. I must stay as sane as my insanity will allow. Solitude is not helping; however, its probably for the best I'm on my own. 

I've started to harbour a slow-burning but infinite rage for the general public; in particular, the people I thought were my friends until I needed them to step up and, y'know, be my fucking friends. Perhaps this is an unfair or even a conceited thing to say, but their ""problems,"" on the whole, are still situations that seem to me, near idyllic. Oh noooo, you couldn't afford the Louis Vuitton purse you wanted and had to settle for the slightly less pretentious Marc Jacobs handbag. Well shucks, you got a massive promotion and have to travel first class all expenses paid to meet a client in Europe. Well shit, I suppose that my life is just peachy keen and I should be able to ooze sympathy for you, while I am literally at my wits end trying to keep afloat, haven't been able to talk to my SO for 7 weeks, and could use a friend to talk to myself; however, shame on me for even trying to talk to you about it..clearly, your dire circumstances are so very much more difficult and I should be ashamed for requesting an ear to talk to, let alone a shoulder to cry on while you are suffering so immensely and I am clearly just crying for attention. 

It all just seems so trivial, and yet, for the few friends (that word seems so wrong) I do still have, I try to offer an ear, a shoulder, a tidbit of advice where I have some that makes sense.  But it makes me vibrate with rage, how they pour the sympathy on each other so thick that it becomes saccharine; and yet, how they brush my problems aside. If, despite it all, I can force myself to plaster a smile on my face and soldier on regardless of how badly I want (and truly deserve, I honestly feel) a break; then how is it fair that its perfectly acceptable for them to bitch and moan at problems that not only do not truly exist, but cease to exist when they either throw money at them, or take ""well deserved"" month long vacations? 

I could use a vacation. Do you have any idea what I would give for a week, all expenses paid, anywhere in the goddamn world right now? Shit, I'd even settle for a week in my bedroom, if only I knew that all my bills were accounted for. It infuriates me, and again - maybe it isn't fair, but I deserve it more than they do. Same with Christmas - I deserve to have presents under the tree that I didn't buy for myself, holiday dinners with people who look forward to seeing me, happiness and community instead of misery and solitude. I didn't ask to come from a fucked up broken home. But I did. And it seems to be yet another one of those things that I don't get to bitch about within my social group. They all tell me to just go home, to forget the past, to make the best of it. If I could, I would..but home is where the alcoholic birth giver and the abusive sperm donor I call mom and dad reside. It isn't as simple as putting away our differences and having a nice get together - I've tried. Someone always ends up battered and regretting the fact that they tried. That someone is wise enough to know that its better just to skirt the situation entirely, as much as it kills me to have to admit. 

I could expand on this point for days but I'm already getting lost in my rage, and that isn't what I'm trying to do tonight. I'm frustrating my damned self, at this point. Inhale. Exhale a cloud of smoke that instantly helps me to relax, at least a little bit. 

There is this teeny tiny itty bitty part of myself that allows this fantasy where my SO shows up on Christmas and I actually get the one thing I really want this year; however, I know better than that. Its yet another frustration: the fantasy makes me smile for an instant, and then reality comes crashing in, as it always does, and I end up back at square one. 

The capacity to believe in God is one that I am starting to envy, for it would make so many things so much easier. Having something bigger than the truth to blame for reality would be such a fabulous and welcome convenience...however, I'm staunch in my atheism. Blame a roman catholic upbringing for that. I do; however, know that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so in a very round about way, I suppose I do believe in reincarnation. Perhaps this is my punishment lifetime.

Or, perhaps, life is just unfair, and it just happened to be the luck of the draw that I was the chosen one; born into an unfair paradigm, and predisposed to have to fight just a little bit harder than everyone else for everything from the love of her parents to her monthly rent. 

That said (and again, perhaps this is conceited and unfair), given the things that frustrate me about other people, I'm almost glad that its me who has to bear the burden of living this life. I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of the people I know would never have made it this far, let alone have the will nor the strength to do what I do every day and try to make it a little further. 

I sound like an asshole when I'm being honest. Maybe I don't deserve friends, nice things, an easy life. 
Maybe I'll never know.

The truth of it all is that at this point, I'm not sure what I'm holding on to anymore. When I was a kid, I had all these hopes and dreams about what life would be like as an adult. I never gave a shit about a wedding or a car or any of that shit, just wanted to get away from my parents and be happy. I thought that escaping the abuse would make me happy, and maybe it would have if leaving home at 14 didn't set me up for even more abuse. I guess that at this point, I'm afraid of happiness, because all of my anecdotal evidence at this point only goes to prove that happiness (for me, at least) is fleeting - it isn't that I never get what I want, its that I do, briefly, and then it is ripped from me and I end up more crushed than I was initially. 

Luckily, I have discovered that no matter what, there is another constant in the world, and that is the fact that drugs help. I remain responsible with them for that reason, too. My mom ruined liquor for me, and I hate being out of touch with reality - living alone at 14, I was always too terrified of not being able to make it home in one piece to lose control. At the end of the day, the only person I've really got is me, and if I lose myself, I'm truly fucked.

That last paragraph set me at ease a bit, and I'm starting to relax again. I am enjoying this very moment, although I accept that it too is fleeting. My workday starts soon, but I still have a good few hours to be in my own company, under the influence in a safe place, Skins on my tiny TV and brain occupied with this endless, pointless dispatch from my rabbit hole. I'd apologize to you all, but fuck that. I'm not forcing you to read this, to enjoy it, to agree with me, to give a flying fuck. I'm just sharing. This is the safest of my safe places right now, for I don't have to try to find a way to explain what only other users of substances can ever comprehend. It is liberating, although for you, probably tedious.

My roommate/landlord is banging around upstairs. He's younger than me, nice enough, smart enough, but nothing truly above average. A lot of my jokes, literary references, ideas fly over his head and it frustrates both myself and him, as communication is hard. He thinks I'm weird, and I feel obligated to dumb myself down. Still, he's the one with a cushy real estate job, and I'm, well..me. He was nice to me until a couple of weeks ago, he was wasted and I wouldn't fuck him. Still won't. I have an SO (as far as I know..fuck), and I'm not looking for anything else. He threw my current job in my face with such vitriol that it physically hurt me. I hear him bragging all the time about the $6000 commissions he's making, and still, he breathes down my neck every day reminding me that he did me a favour the first month I was here, extending my rent due date to the 15thbof this month and that I'd better have next months on the 1st.
He doesn't even need the money. Its a power play. I am not by myself in this house, but I am certainly alone.

Just once, I'd like to have the upper hand; however, I don't think I would know what the fuck to do with it. 

I need a cigarette, and I think I want to sit in the tub with my book and a cup of coffee for a little while before I strategize how best to get through this, another day I don't particularly want to face, but kind of have to.

By the way, Chad Kultgen is a marvelous author, for those bibliophiles out there. I starter with ""The Average American Male,"" which I highly recommend, and I'm about 2/3 through ""Men, Women and Children,"" which is brilliant and chilling. 

I'm sure there will be more from me.
Unless, by some grace of Jeebus, I keel over in the tub, which we all know I wouldn't complain about at all, st this point.

The phone is still dead, but the day is early. $300 to make in 12 days, that's 3 appointments away. I have faith that there are three more johns for me before the next rent cheque is due. I have fear that there isn't, too, but its all about the positive vibes, right? Whatever. I'm trying.

Rainy day on the wet coast. Lots of police downtown today, too. They're shooting a movie or something a couple blocks from skid row, which is probably to blame for that. I got downtown with the pills I found in an old handbag last night, and said a little prayer that someone would be looking for what I had on me. Four T4s, a couple concerta, a couple tabs of E, a shit pile of seroquel. 

There's a few perks to being a pretty young woman who doesn't look like a junkie. The first guy I talked to saw me sweating, traded me a couple points for a couple T3s. Success. Bored, I kept on going - a block down, a concerta and the 2 e tabs for another 2 points. Another few blocks then I remembered that the safe injection site was close. I haven't IVd down, ever. Ive only ever IVd coke, and my SO shot me up both times I did that. I miss him and it hurts it hurts it hurts until I chase the dragon in their bathroom, grabbing a handful of rigs, some clean cookers water ties and swabs as I leave. I have a deal with the devil, I'm playing Russian roulette with my life. For now,I'll keep to foil and lines off the back of my journal; however, if the 31 comes and I'm still fucked, I'm outta this world with a needle and the rent money I do have in my tiny little veins. I choose not to focus on that thought, its all consuming and all too comforting. 

I keep walking, hear my alias called. My favorite dealer is there, smile on his face. I trade him a T3 and a cigarette for a $20 quarter gram of the best heroin I've ever had. 

I say goodbye, turn around to head to my coffee shop haunt. A guy my age asks to borrow my lighter, and gives me a nice little rock of jib to say thanks. 

Junkie Jesus, thank you. I spent only $20 but left with plenty. I shouldn't have spent that twenty beans but I would have anyways. Junkie math: nothing really fucking matters if I'm dope sick. 

So now I sit, stoned and depressed, wishing I had better shoes on so I could walk more without my feet erupting in even more blisters. I remind myself of that song, I think its Phil Collins -""she's got blisters on the sole of her feet, she can't walk but she's trying, oh think twice, its just another day for you and me in paradise.."" I hide it well for now. I am still at a relatively healthy weight, dress nicely and don't have to worry about track marks for the time being.. I never will if I play my cards right. If I shoot up, I'm doing it once and riding the short bus straight to Hell. 

At first glance, I'm any normal 24 year old girl. I fit in at any university campus, look like any average, semi attractive human female. My dark dark eyes hide pinned pupils pretty easily. You have to look pretty close to see the physical signs of my intoxication, I rarely nod off in public. I prefer to do that at home. 

To really see that I'm a junkie, you either need to catch me trying to cop on the DTES, or talk to me long enough and with enough understanding that I crack and the tears start to flow. So few people know that side of me, and the ones that do have largely fucked off out of my life. I hear that its too hard to be my friend a lot these days. Good thing they don't have to walk in my shoes, cause I guarantee that it is harder to be me than it is to know me.

And it is hurting me to think again. I need to cut this off. Nobody wants the working girl with tears streaming down her face. Tinfoil and Tooter in my purse, coffee on my table to save my seat, I'm off to chase the dragon and bide my time.",1418950201.0

I'm still awake, afraid that in the dark quiet stillness of the night, one of my thoughts might just make sense and I'll have to feel a feeling or two. The only feeling I want to let myself feel is (ironically) tied right the fuck back to last night, when I was typing out my bullshit and still convinced that I'd get laughed outta this community, like every single other one I've ever been a part of; and then, through messages and comments and actual fucking human contact with you, my fellow bropiate/ettes (although, is it really human contact if we are all still relative strangers? I choose to say yes, as my money is on the likelihood of us all actually getting along in real life and having a crazy drug fuelled month long conversation that no normal/boring person could possibly understand, then miraculously managing to pull enough money together to do it all again when we are dry in some Tarantino-esque plot that every junkie has experienced, just because its day__and the jib made us do it. Yeah yeah yeah, so I daydream a lot. Point is, it counts because I genuinely like you all a whole lot more than pretty much everyone I actually have real human contact with on any sort of semi-regular basis; however, I digress), I felt so much less alone in my loneliness, so much less arbitrary, so much more a person and less some misunderstood caricature of the early 90s D.A.R.E. days. Its kinda overwhelming, this rediscovery of my true love of writing, which is truly nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to both legitimize the habit of and negate the pathetic truth that I'm actually not a very good writer/interesting person - I'm a lonely, self-important and likely schizophrenic egomanic who constantly narrates her own life in an attempt to make it both less boring and more something that doesn't make me just a junkie whore with some serious egomania issues. I really don't know how to express the way I felt when I realized that the habit I've had the longest; that is, writing these long and pointless diatribes that barely make sense to me and probably terrify the general public, brought some of you more than just disgust or a(nother) reason to laugh at me..well, that is besides saying THANKS, ASSHOLES. NOW I BOTH WANT TO AND FEEL THAT I SHOULD, IN FACT, WRITE MY DAMN BOOK. I'd long convinced myself that I wasn't a good enough person or narrator to do so..but now I feel justified and accountable. And so much less alone. Y'all fucking floored me, offers of all sorts of advice and support and help and friendship (including a pending meeting with a fellow city-dwelling redditor who might have  restored some of the faith I used to have in humanity, simply through being fucking awesome). I owe it not only to myself, but to you guys, to keep on fucking talking. About everything. About nothing. Just do me a favour, eh? If I off myself/otherwise cease being alive, could you guys please make sure that these dispatches get published? I just wanna confuse the normies and give junkiedom a little taste of non-Hollywooded fame. I might not be that interesting, but our weird little tribe as a whole sure is.

Anyways. Fuck you guys in the nicest way possible. I have something I enjoy doing to look forward to and feel accountable for again. I guess I'll have to agree to fall on that grenade -though my rubber arm might need a twisting. 

I'm on day 2. I once again decided that jib and bullshitting was a more attractive option than sleep and normalcy. I'm not even gonna bother apologizing for taking you all further down my rabbit hole. The truth is, day 2, jib, sarcasm, self-deprication, all of it - its all smoke and mirrors. When Alice falls down into the pit where I keep the things I actually think and feel and try my fucking hardest to conceal from myself (and to convince everyone else that they do not exist, error 404: emotion not found, thought process corrupted), that's when I'll apologize to y'all. This is nothing for my junkie tribe, we are all running from truths and memories and expectations and realities that we cannot change, but can ignore entirely through chemistry and arguably irresponsible life choices. 

What's frustrating is that I had a good day, nay, a fantastic one.
On paper.
In papers, I have enough jib to make being awake less work than it usually is, enough heroin to sedate the hamster in my brain that's recently decided to clock world-record shattering speeds on the broken record of my mind...conveniently and consistently and solely when I decide that I need to catch the 26th letter a few times. 

I am clinging to you guys. I am drowning in a sea of uncertainty and groundhog like days that are making me undoubtedly more unstable, less human, more machine; and yet, revealing the humanity beneath my programming. Help me Junkie Wan JibDopie - you're my only hope. I'm stranded in a sea of questions I can't answer and things I can't have; I'm drowning in my self loathing and wallowing in my self pity. 
I need my Junkie Jesus fix to come to me today in ways it never has before, at least, not at my direct request - I need the right combination of substances and sleep deprivation to allow me a moment of clarity, addict style. Let me make that a little more clear - I don't want a justification, carte blanche; rather, inner peace in regard to who I have become (have I let myself become this person? Was I shaped and moulded at  the hands and pipes of others? Is it both or neither or some permutation of all of my guesses?), and some kind of absolution for the time I have recently wasted. If I'm gonna do this writing thing, at least I get to look forward to more time spent high and less time spent sober; although, that likely means more money spent that I don't have and less money hidden away that junkie math has already spent, despite having earmarked it for things that matter - on that list, shoes that don't make my feet erupt into painful and immense blisters all along the soles of my feet. We all know I'll never , ever make good on that purchase, and that I will, instead, walk up and down the DTES and the downtown core and the neighborhood I live in on painful feet that make me want to cry, but cry so much infinitely less than the notion of spending a quarter gram flaps worth of coin on anything other than a quarter motherfucking gram.

Except maybe an eighth of a  gram of truly bomb cocaine. I miss good cocaine miss chipping pieces off the keys we used to get before we hacked them up into so much more product than we had prior. Those cocaine memories are a lame allegory to my existence. I have become so much infinitely less by allowing myself to become so much infinitely more than I used to be. Conversely, i used to be so much infinitely more when I was okay with being tangibly less substantial. If that sentiment makes sense to you...either I phrased it wrong or you're a woman who moved up high in the business rankings - and not as a strawberry, an old lady, arm candy, but a soldier. 

Likely, I am alone in that sentiment, that particular feeling, and the vast majority of all else I have ever said or anything I have yet to say. I'm pretty sure I am completely insane in ways that can be neither fixed nor understood, that I speak a language that doesn't exist, and that everyone I meet either placates me because I'm funny, fascinating in a weird science way, or too fucking pathetic to leave on my own in the wild. I have no one but myself to blame - they tried to teach me to be normal when I was still a malleable specimen of somewhat worthy and sound constitution. Those days are long past me. I am no longer trainable, never to member of productive society whether users or sober, never to be the kid that fits in or the adult that knows how to pretend well enough to be assimilated into friendships, working relationships, romantic partnerships.

As much as I want to let myself wallow in the sorrow and confusion and pain and anger associated with my own romantic soulmate man i love more than myself and my small part in his world, I can't. I can barely admit to myself what I'm not sure of but know to be true. If I say it here I'll have to admit to my written word gospel of nonsensical truth that I am not only in pain, but that its affecting me this much.

Fair trade: get higher, be surprised that it isn't yet 4:00am, and write with some feeble and unimportant attempt at structure, at content that flows and matters, whatever the fuck that means. Let me tell you about my workday, but let me first smoke some amphetamines out of a lightbulb and revel in the fact that I will never be able to put my most impressive skills on a resume: creating smoking utensils out of household items, bucking rails in moving cars, concealing pupils that do not make sense in their environment, rolling joints of all shapes, creative ways to extract the most of any substance from its original method of containment.

I'm like the fucking McGuiver grand master flash of the upper world with merit badges in opiate usage and honours credits awarded for excellence in  perseverance in copping multiple substances 201 as well as advanced theory of success getting oneself high when one is dry...and yet, I'm both overqualified to flip hamburgers at McDonalds and under qualified to perform neurosurgery. Where's the justice, truly? Those are carefully honed and valuable skills that will never be recognized at a corporate picnic, let alone invited to accept the corner office and a massive pay raise...
And yet, I'd still Rather know how to roll a cross joint than how to list my references in APA format, still prefer sleepless nights spent turning 60w bulbs into amphetamine puddling pipes to all nighters that result in term papers. I learned a veritable fuckton at uni, just very little that I've ever shown off to my dear old ma and pa.
I wonder if the chemistry behind producing shake and bake meth would be enough to woo my straight edge dad to let his hair down and just embrace the weird ride out to day 9, wonder if the ritualistic obsession that preparing both my heroin and my cocaine would be enough to distract my mom from liquor long enough to fall out of love with being wasted. 

Part of me is so upset at the rest of me for staying up way later than. I said I would. Again. The rest of me is legitimately enjoying the pull of the jib down smoke melange enough that staying awake and continuing the party until we are back here exactly again tomorrow (today?) , making the sane wrong decision for the proper inhumane but politically correct-ish reasons.
I promise myself and my sanity to get at least some sleep tonight. As long as I am out with in the next 2 hours, tomorrow's budgets for both amphetamine and opiate will be plenty. As long as I don't hit day three, I can skirt weirdness that I think I'd honestly prefer some uncomfortable time with my sleeping consciousness than I would with sleep-deprived waking hell avoidance tactics. 

I miss the days and days and days I used to get to spend relishing days and days and days awake with my love, but I'm cutting myself off right there, and digressing, much too late but right on time.

Junkie Jesus was kind of an asshole today - none of my DTES peeps were around, the jib I got was alright but burns kinda fucky; the dizz I got is of my favourite sort, but my points were light as air, which is both annoying and heartbreaking to a true opiate fiend. Heartbreaking because you will never raise the hell in your heart; rather, you will accept them for what they are, swear to buy off someone else next time, then end up with more disappointing same same same, regardless of how steely your resolve and how certain you are that you could of course cop a sweet deal if only patience  decided to make an appearance rather than the dope sick gremlins, forged themselves of hellfire and Shania Twain music. 

Its always the same.
Even on the good days. I made $280 for 150 minutes of work. MY rent is almost paid. I came home with drugs and I don't have to share.

Its a weird moment in true junkiedom when you look at your stash and realize that you'd happily go with less in order to have another junkie of choice - in my case, my SO - there with you in that exact moment, that you'd be okay with the fiendy blues for the friendly use that used to drive you fucking crazy. Yeah, I have all the jib, but I also have all the time in the world (seemingly literally) to wallow in my solitude. It is a truth that carries from my personal to professional life and manifests in me hating the fucking g a johns even fucking more than I do by default. They'll never fill the void, though the proverbial space between was indeed less than empty today, thrice over - the truth is, being filled only makes you emptier inside. The realization that there are no others, no substitutes in life for certain things - pure(as it can be in north america) cocaine, any vegetarian permutation of a dish originally containing butter or bacon, good coffee, great sex - that realization makes everything else not only pale in comparison, but make you long for the real thing with both melancholy and rage that don't seem either real or rational, but consume you all the same. That's why I hate the John's, regardless of how okay they are in theoretical reality. 

That, and the fact that sometimes they're really fucking weird, and then I'm forced to remember and accept the fact that these bizarre, usually somewhat hilarious, and always needlessly tedious perversions are in fact your problem, as you are actually the woman that they are paying to pretend not to mind the things their wives won't do and judge them not so secretly for with the rest of the bored housewives that they pretend to give a fuck about. At least I have the common courtesy to continue the charade of not being completely perplexed and turned off by the retarded and usually nowhere near dirty and way too close to tasteless things I do to pay my rent. I may laugh behind closed doors, but I maintain that laughter is a coping mechanism for the dozens of times I have heard some variation on the theme of my attractiveness being primarily to blame on the fact that I can, rather easily, pass entirely convincingly for an underage girl. How many times have I masqueraded as a cousin, a daughter, a student that was off limits, not even to be p privy to the truth myself?

I hate the johns. I hate them all.

I'm just hoping my assement seems correct and that this isn;t a big deal of any kind? Say it was a burst vein even..it will heal, not likely get infected- etc  ???

I don't want to worry about this and I'm hoping it's not cause for any real concern.

Any feedback from veterans will be-as always- very much appreciated, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. Have a great weekend. 

EDIT: it''s not very long but it's not tiny either. it's longer than my finger, it's about the length of the bottom of my palm to the tip of my middle finger, 

It mirrors the vein that was/is there. in fact it had little branching arms just like any vein and those arms have already faded. 

Can histamine reactions look like this too? I thought those were blotchy? i am 95% sure I've had one of those before, just never this shape.

I railed about 100mg of this and it made my nose bleed and I felt pretty sick trying to keep it down with the drip.  To the point of gagging and I have a pretty strong stomach compared to the people I've drank with or used with.  

I am having trouble finding a good way to seperate the cut from the H.  The cut seems to dissolve in water.  Do you think I could use a coffee filter and water to try and separate the two?  Does anyone know of a better way.  

The cut almost smells sweet but it is more than harsh on my nose and is completely repulsive.  Here are some pics

_-----------------_

Right now, I am comfortable in my 
Discomfort, my clothes fit me again and
It makes me all too conscious, self-
Aware that the five plus pounds I have 
Gained mean that there is more of
Me; and at the same time, there is
Less. All I want to do is crawl out of
Myself, unzip the flesh that traps my
Bones, find a way to disappear and
At the same time, to exist, to take
Center stage. The last time I weighed 
This much, you were here, with your
Family, for your brother's wedding and
I was alone in the same different place, 
Making the same promises to myself,
On the same 5-day countdown to both
Collarbones and kisses, cocaine wishes,
Caviar dreams. Nothing is as it seems 
In this celluloid reverie - in my mind
I fight an uphill battle akin to WWIII,
Killing myself to try to live in this life
Like a normal happy person who is not
Defined by all of the hurt and the 
Heavy boulders that make days seem 
Grey, make the only answer to fade away
Deep into the background - but the face
I paint on every day tells the rest of
The world another fairytale. The choice 
Is mine but not entirely in my 
Hands. I want health but my bruised
Scarred knuckles reveal another gory
Truth - hours days years spent on
Well-worn blackened knees
Praying to the porcelain toilet bowl
Gods. O, Metabolism, please cooperate, I
Ate today to stoke your furnace flames
Before I undertake a liquid
Fast. 120 hours to purge 
Myself of the layer of fat that separates
My hipbones from view. 5 days until I am
Reunited with the man I love, and there
Needn't be that much of me for him to
Hold, light as a feather and delicate like
The porcelain dolls I was too afraid to
Play with as a child. 
My prized possessions, queens 
Reigning over their kingdom from the 
Highest shelf, untouched and untouchable 
For fear of shattering them in my 
Chubby, ungraceful hands. 
That is the power which accompanies
Brittle things; 
Hair, teeth, nails, precarious 
Porcelain toys staring from their eternal
Perch. To be the one everybody stares at
But dares not to touch, to have but not
To hold, to revere with fear that is
Palpable. 
O, Starvation, self-hatred
O Purity of Soul. 
Regain perspective
And lose this weak week of saltsugarfat
Acceptance. Pay the tithe and live your 
Penance. I do not deserve this title credit,
The Leading Lady is always lithe, and I
Am but a shameful lie, hiding newfound 
Rolls and lost self-control in strategic 
Spandex, pulling focus with a face still
Pretty enough to turn a head or two, 
Counting calories behind brown eyes that 
Know the sorrow of the true form, hidden 
Beneath the wardrobe, the makeup, the 
Wolf's grin that makes me worse than 
The lies we tell our children to make 
The world a little more magical. 
O, Genetics, O cruel DNA, tell me I was 
Born this way, but that I can change it 
Too. Father's side, short and wide, will
Never be a good enough excuse. 
Retribution begins with deprivation,
Motivation and starvation of both mind 
And corporeal self alike, and yet so far
Removed from the New World Order of
The newfound gap between my thighs.
Best prepare my catalog of alibis as to
Why (once again, surprise surprise) I 
Would rather deny myself of calories 
Than sit and eat and exist in the truest
Sense of the word. 
There is so much 
Hatred inside of me for the 
Amphetamines I do not possess, for the
Number on the scale, for all of the 
Women who do not have to try to be
Beautiful, for my weak will, for the goals
I will never reach. O, Love; O Main Man
For whom I die to live, I pray that in time
You can forgive the woman who you are
Unfortunately infatuated with. 
Strength Is not my forte, and I cringe when that is 
The compliment I am forced to swallow,
Trying not to choke to death over pillow 
Talk and benign conversations. No, my
Darling, there are no definites in this life
But I will trade you a promise - your 
Abstinence from intravenous escape for
My skeletal beauty. Put down your needle
And I will put down the silver spoon you
Put into my mouth, close my jaws and
Bare my ribcage to you. My only offering
Is my flesh, my salvation only found in 
Starvation. And I must confess that it 
Takes a lot of work to look this god damn
Terrible, a lot more to deserve to be seen
Hand in hand with the star of the show, 
The man everyone knows is far out of my
League (but chose me, mystery). I can 
Keep a secret if you can, too. I can't make 
This confession face to face, but I won't 
Have to if I can just do my stupid part,
Play the role written especially for me. 
120 hours from now, when my stomach 
Is empty and my heart is full and you are
Beside me once again, you will know the
Truth without my saying as much as a
Single word - cheekbones scream where
I am silent. 
My existence is failure.

Sleep is an art form which the weak have perfected,
And which I have yet to bother to learn.
I do not crave the solace found on the other side of the fence
That contains a counted flock of sheep -
My contentment comes in the stillness of the night,
The silence only found when the others are lost in imaginary places,
Strawberry fields and fanciful lands; wherein anything is possible,
Where everything is beautiful and nothing hurts.

I watch from my eternal perch as some toss, some turn,
Some snore, some suck their thumbs;
I watch as parents beseech the Sandman to work his magic on the young,
As lovers entwine into human knots,
As believers pray for their souls to keep,
As the lonely pine for their matching spoon,
As the troubled sedate themselves with pills,
As eventually,
The talking ceases,
The televisions drone,
The breathing slows,
The people sleep.
While the rest of the world catches the 26th letter over and  over again, 
I am free to truly exist.

I am the thing that goes bump in the night,
I am avoiding the monsters under my bed;
The skeletons that pack my closet so full,
Wayward metatarsals render the door incapable of closing.

Forgive me Father, for I have sinned - 
I have embraced my insomnia with a wink and a grin,
I impatiently await the witching hour, 
For it renders both myself and my fears irrelevant and docile -
Perhaps, if you were to just sit and share a cigarette, stay a while,
That sentiment would baffle you slightly less.
Perhaps if your dreams were as foul as my memories, 
You could better comprehend my bad relationship with reverie.
It is simply easier to stay awake,
It is easier to cover dark undereye circles than it is to hide from the things I should not have survived,
That happened to me when the world was fast asleep.

My yawns are silent screams - 
Would you believe me if I told you that I didn't scream back then, either?

The Eternal Footman has a bounty on my head,
But him I do not fear - 
If, despite the life I have chosen, he hasn't yet caught me,
Then indeed there must be more for me on this Earth -
Defying odds, I embrace my horror, my truth, my youth.
And besides, 
Why sleep and risk my sanity, my safety, my twilight comfort,
When my cane corso soulmate, my love, my nighttime sentinel,
Is not beside me to ward off the terror of the dusk?

And what I fear, you implore?
I cannot expect you to understand.

Fall on injured knees,
And hear the sinister voices,
O Night, unkind!
Taste the memory of unwanted seed,
And dream of your youthful virtue wasted,
By charming men with inhuman faces.

The world may be a frightening place,
But is nothing compared to the recollection 
Of the way I was forced to become one
Who appreciates her propensity
To forego her bedtime.

I told you, Mom & Dad, sleep is for the weak.
I told you, Mom & Dad, you'll never bleed like me.

Ah, but forgiveness makes us wise,
And though I cannot find a way to truly pardon my villains,
I accept an apology with every sunrise cigarette,
Though silent, it is poignant - 
A whisper of hope, a glimmer of serenity - 
If only I can keep myself alive until morning,
And repeat, ad infinitum.
My perpetual curse; my infinite benediction.

I watch from my eternal perch as the world sleeps,
Forevermore in silence - 
For sleep is where my secrets dwell,
And with my truths reside the monsters.

I can wrestle the ones who live under my bed,
But I cannot handle those who forced me into theirs.

There is no lullaby soothing enough on lonely evenings 
To lull the Nightowl from her trance, 
And find her sweetly sleeping",1419005440.0

Syringe Keeps Moving.,"Im new to shooting up.  I have really shitty veins that are pretty deep beneath my skin.  It took me forever to get to the point where I could find a vein and when id draw back blood would actually flow up into the syringe.  One time I tried 15 different areas and got a big air bubble each time.  But ya now ive got it down so I can get it in the vein an draw up blood. Heres my problem though.  I have a VERY hard time drawing up blood or pushing the plunger down with one hand.  Virtually everytime I do so the syringe moves and either pokes through the vein and out the other end of pulls back out.

Once you find the vein and draw back a good amount of blood how do you keep the syringe in place so that it doesnt move?  The plunger's plastic is too flimsy to push or pull with just my thumb, it just bends.  Id get different syringes but I have like 3000 of these and the other nicer ones are about 75 cents a piece.

Because I cant drawback or push down on the plunger with just my thumb I have to gently let go of the syringe, pray it doesnt move, and re-adjust my hand to the top of the syringe so I can push down on the plunger.

Im in desperate need of advice, since the syringe typically moves Im usually only able to get about half of the shot into the actual vein.  Thank you in advance guys!

BTW im using Kroger Ultra Comfort 30 Gauge 8mm/5/16"" (short) 1CC Syringes.  I just switch from 26 gauge long needles and these new ones work much better for me, MUCH LESS bruising and pain, and more accurate insertion into vein.",1419127520.0

I text hus girl and ask if they are good with what they had the night before... No reply. I send another text to her an hour later askinf if hed even left yet. No reply. I call his phone at 9am, 10am, 11am. Still no answer. Finally at 12pm i text his girl again and im like ""im fucking sick, can u just sell me something if he left you anythung to sell til he gets back."" She finally answers and is like ""yeah, im good, but he still isnt back yet with the NJ dope."" Im like thats fine ill take whatever you got. When i go and pick up the only 5 bags shes got she says ""He should(note she said ""should"") be back tonight, they ran into traffic."" Im sure that really means He probably didnt leave until this morning right before she had me come by pick up the 5 bags. Im not worried about him stealing my $, ive been going through him for 8 years now and have thrown down with him before like this, just never to go out of town. Anyway the one good thing is the 5 i got this morning were really good. Who knows if hell even be back tonight though.

TLDR: Went in $500 with my dude on his out of state reup. He was supposed to be back last night since he was supposed to have left yesterday morning. Turns out he probably didnt leave until 11am this morning and ""should"" be back tonight.

Edit: for those who think im making this up, ive been doing dope 11 years and have been on sub maint. since 2008, so when i stop for a few days to get high, i still get sick. And these days i only sniff so i can easily run through $500 between fri, sat, sun and monday.",1419098465.0

2q2r86,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2q2r86/new_study_finds_opiate_tolerance_can_be_reversed/,62,https://redd.it/2q2r86,paxtana,New study finds opiate tolerance can be reversed and prevented with a common supplement [via r/DrugNerds],"*Warning: Use caution with this information, if you take your regular dose after lowering your tolerance you could have an overdose* 

Theracurmin is a supplement made from the asian spice Turmeric, available at a cost of about a dollar per gram. Research published last week shows it has a strong effect of immediately reducing opiate tolerance and dependence. It also showed how this dosage will prevent future tolerance from building, assuming you keep taking the supplement before you ingest opiates. Additionally it was shown to have significant effects at reducing the symptoms of opiate withdrawal. 

Of course if your tolerance stays low you will not have to use as much, not have to buy as much, have a healthier life while still enjoying opiate effects, and probably end up saving a ton of cash. Which is all pretty great, so here's what we know so far: 

> In this study, we have demonstrated that one time administration of PLGA-curcumin (20mg/kg , p.o.) is effective in preventing acute morphine tolerance and dependence, and in reversing both established acute and chronic morphine tolerance and dependence.

The study also showed small effects from regular curcumin, which is a more crude extract from turmeric. Theracurmin is basically the same chemical but specially formulated to be as small as nanoparticles, which greatly increases how much gets absorbed. The study shows theracurmin is 11 times as effective at lowering tolerance and 33 times as effective at lowering dependence.  So if you want to try reducing tolerance make sure you get the refined version and not regular curcumin, many companies sell it so finding the right thing should not be too hard.

Other notes: It must be digested before taking your opiate dose, which probably means planning ahead by 45 minutes or so. Dose does not have to be same as 20mg/kg like the mice experiments, humans do not need that much. But this is a nontoxic antioxidant supplement so a gram or more will not hurt, and only time will tell exactly what dosage works best. 

Everything written here is just some initial guidelines. It will be a while before we know for sure what are the best practices for actual opiate enthusiasts, so I would encourage those who experiment to post results so others can benefit.

The thing is the relationship with my wife has really crumbled this year. We constantly argue, snipe at each other and generally cause bad vibes between each other. A lot of this is my fault. I've ODd at home, brought needles into a home with a one year old and generally been a selfish addict at times. Our relationship is really broken and I feel its having a negative impact on my son.

I'm the main bread winner, by far. My wife only works two days and I want to keep it that way. A baby boy should be with his mother and should have a safe a secure home. We have discussed me moving out and I have agreed if it comes to that to still pay the mortgage on this place and the bills so my son can be safe.

The thing is if I do move out I will go back to daily use. Just a shot a day but I know I'd do that. I think about using far too much. I suffer from really bad depression. I see a shrink, I go to SMART and I'm on SSRIs. But the only true break I get from my own mind is with a needle in my arm. My life with my wife is so limited, she controls my card and doesn't trust me with even a £10. This is leading to huge resentment on both parts. I work hard and have zero freedom and she is almost baby sitting me.

So I'm looking for some opinions. I know this is  more agony aunt than opiates but most of you understand addiction as well as I do. I know if I stay here I'm constantly going to be playing cat and mouse with my wife, even if only using sparingly. If she catches me again she will go and relationship with her and her family will be well past civil. If I go of my own accord things will still be good and I'll be able to see my son everyday without going through the courts. He will be in an environment that isn't always tense. I will have my freedom and be able to use without fear of recourse. 

Am I a terrible father? Maybe. I will make sure he has can stay in our current house and see him everyday but no dark cloud hanging over the house all the time.",1419255027.0

I live in a west coast city, and if you do too, and do dope, chance are you know about the mexicans. Cartel or gang or just friends, they basically drive around and deliver quality dope to you at your crib if you've been a customer for a while, or usually a parking lot or something.

I used to get dope from one a while back. I knew this addict from HS who ended up being a backpage hooker. Hate to judge but chick was absolutely disgusting, marks all over, huge cyst on the back of her leg, stank breath, etc. Anyway, she had a mexicans number, so i'd call her up, she'd call him up, i'd get the stuff, badda bing badda boom. She'd get it for $80/g and half the time charge me $80, half the time $90 if she needed the $ or had to go out of her way. Super reasonable and cool. Anyway, as dopehead hookers living out of their crackhead pimps motel rooms do, she fell off the face of the earth. So back to copping $100/g shitty tar from the local hood spot.

Anyway, if you use this delivery service, how the fuck did you get the number? How does anyone? Word of mouth? I have a friend on here that moved from the east to a city in Nevada and said he was pissed because there was virtually no open air market and he had no clue how to get a hold of one of the mexican/cartel/whatever drivers.

I'm not currently on the west coast but I will be in like 2-3 months and i'd like to figure out a way to get one of their numbers before I get there. So like I said again, how'd you do it?",1419227226.0

Vamoose, Sonofabitch!","Yesterday was nearly over before it even had a chance to begin. I try to be as honest as I can handle in my writing; however, I have been grossly under stating the depression that the recent and relentless bullshit that has been plating me as of late. Naturally, sleep deprivation doesn't really help, but I did manage a truly glorious sleep last night, and today I am feeling pretty amazing. But we will get there, I digress. Yesterday morning, I got ready as quick as possible because ye old creepy MC landlord was trying to get all up in my pants again and I was grumpy and had plans to meet up with a fellow bropiate for the first time, which was indeed the highlight of my day. I kicked myself for letting myself leave the house looking so utterly wretched (he turned out to be a fuckin cutie, which us, of course, a bonus), but my sallow face and pouffy hair didn't seem to completely ruin things. We had a short but sweet wander through Gastown before he had to work and I acquired up and down and decided to go sit at my favourite cafe, get out of the rain, and call my unholy trinity of girlbros to get some perspective and advice on the SO situation. A couple or hours and too much espresso later, I finally got the call that I had a John. Got to the in call. Cancellation. Rinse. Repeat. I said fuck it and went to McDicks to continue dribking coffee and utilising free wifi. The SO was supposed to be on a no phone, no internet ban for the nxt 30 days, and for the umpteenth time sine November, I saw his Facebook messenger icon light up, watched the activity pile up in his news feed, and felt the sick certainty of knowing that I was being lied to. Freaky timing when one of my girlbros texted me with all the truth and proof I needed to make the nagging decision I wish I would have been strong and certain enough to make the last time I saw his face. He went off the rails a few weeks ago, stqyed in our old flop house, made time to either see or call all of our old friends. Except me. I knew then. And yesterday, I had that corroborated. What really hurt was the text he had sent my girlbro, pretty much telling her that he kept me around for leisure, for sport. That I loved him way too much, much more than he loved me, and that he found it both tragic and hilarious, that he enjoyed ignoring me, imagining my pain.

Yeah fuck that. I very publicly broke up with him on Facebook, then let myself feel all the feels on the skytrain ride home. By the time I hit my driveway, I felt like myself again for the first time in a very, very long time.

There are very few people that I like in this world; even fewer that get the grace or my love. To have that mocked, to have my affections and efforts and honest, true love taken for granted? I do not fucking think so. Single feels right, right now. There is no shortage of attractive males out there. Bropiate is proof positive of that. I won't lie, it hurts that someone I have had in my life for a decade changed that profoundly that quickly, but it really is just not my motherfucking problem anymore. 

I really just don't want to be anyone's anything anymore. I want the freedom to live or to die with absolutly no owed explanations. I miss having sex (apparently, he lost interest because, get this, my being short makes me automatically a bad lay), I miss being flirted with, I miss dates and having excuses to get dressed up and be young and pretty and appreciated for such - outside of the realm ot Johns and hooking.

I slept like a champ. Woke up to a pile of texts from old flames and friends. Decided today that I'm going to go back to Calgary for Christmas, see some of the old crew that is still in my good books, revisit some old hqunts, whatever.

I hate the fucking keyboard on this thing. I do not have enough fucks left to give to bother with fixing my messy typing.

I'm downtown killing thw day waiting for more work and waiting for my phone to charge. I need to go cop, then I'm gonna rinse and repeat.

I feel like myself again, for the first time in w really lng while. I feel pretty, happy, light and I'm enjoying it, for now. Hypomania, or side effect of losing 210 pounds of ginger haired dead weight without even using a diet pill?

Who knows? Who cares?

Hastings awaits and I wanna get this done before the rain starts.

I'm alive. I'm getting better. I'm sorry for the concern for my wrllbeing that the last dispatch caused. I apologize in advance, because the truth is, I always have been and always will be a trqinwreck.

I'm just taking it a little slower and more enjoyably than normal right now.

We will see where this goes. I keep hoping that I haven't entirely trrified bropiate. Getting fucked up with like minded folks is always grqnd. Which reminds me - i need to cop enough to get me through my calgary adventure, as being dopesick at family dinner at my best friends house on Xmas is not fucking happening.

Mine is relatively low but I do believe it never fully resets and certainly goes back to previous high very quickly.

As an indication, before I started shooting I once snorted 2.5g of DNM fire #4 in about a 30 hour session, with red wine too. Since picking up the needle I've gone through 20mg of Fent HCL in about a week. Recently, in hospital, I got through just over a g of #3, about 5mg of Fent HCL and hospital morphine in about a day, all IV. Past Fentanyl and benzo use means I rarely catch a full nod, just semi. So I feel my 'high tide' tolerance is pretty high but not insane.

Anyway, to the point of this and its more of an observation than a question. I'm slowing my use down from a day or two a week to hopefully a day or two or month. Out of respect for myself, my health and my wife and family. I've just shot a 10mg morphine tab along with a really weak wash.

It really pissed me off cause he wouldnt tell me how long it was gonba be our if they had even got there. I call again this morning at 8am with no answer. So i texted him and said ""cant believe youre throwing away 8 years of trust."" Well that got him to call me. He started yelling ""what the fuck are you talking about? Were two hours away. I cant believe you would say some shit like that."" I can also here two other people in the car agreeing with him. Then he hung up on me and starts texting how he thought we were friends and hed never do that and how i didnt care about his well being. It was such a cliche of what certain people do when you call them out on something, instead of seeing they were in the wrong, they go on the offensive and get angry at you and act like u were wrong. At this point im getting a little worried he might not give me my shit. So i text back that i do give a fuck about him and list lots of times ive looked out for him and warned him about shady people. He kinda cools down and says hell call me in two hours when hes back. So finally i go to meet him and get my shit. We both apologized and he said he was just tired and like everything on the trip went wrong. That their car broke down, they had to rent a uhaul(i did see the uhaul), he was the only one with gas and toll money(over $300 in tolls and gas), that initially he was supposed to trade the dudes he was meeting two items but when they got there the dudes didnt want them. And there are signs up there saying its a huge fine for driving on the phone. But he apologized and said he woulda been pissed too if it was the other way around and i didnt call him. So it all worked and now im set on dope for a few good days. The bags are fatter than normal and really good. It really pissed me off when he said i didnt give a fuck about him cause i for real do. Weve known each other for so long. Hes always looked out for me.

How do you deal when you don't have your DOC (or any opi)? Either taking a break by choice, forced into it, or a combination of the two.

I'm currently on day 2 of w/d. It is surprisingly bearable thanks to mainly to lope and a couple OTC supplements. But I do miss the reliable euphoria. Especially miss that extra something to get my day started, and to wind down at night. I'd love to get to a point where I can just chip or whatever, with my off days still being enjoyable as possible.

So my buddy has a connect for some fire tickets about 2 hours away, nothing good in my beach town in eastern nc. Overpriced garbage and overpriced pills mostly. But I've tried these stamps a few times and decided because it was raining and work was shut down, we were going on a mission. Called up dude man and everything was straight. 2 buns for 140 a piece. Not bad at all. So we make the drive stopping at walmart for rigs and show up deep in the hood ten minutes early. (Buddy failed to mention we were heading into blood territory) but other than that everything is solid. Now his hookup won't answer the phone. After 3 calls it starts going straight to voicemail. Now, I've saved all my loot for 2 days for this and I'm sick. Turned down a couple pink opanas last night for this. 45 minutes go by and I'm pissed because two tattooed whiteboys sitting or driving around in this neighborhood is fuckin suspect. Cussing out my boy, I leave the spot. I decide to stop at a ghetto gas station for a beer and a pack of smokes cuz smoked all mine out of stress. I notice a couple black guys obviously slinging outside the door and casually give them a nod on my way in. After I buy my cigs I walk outside and ask the bigger of the two (big dude with dreads) if he knew where I could get some diesel. (I'm originally from jersey) he replies wtf is diesel? I got hard, you want in any? I said lol no man lol I'm look in for some dope, ron, you know what I mean? He says OOOO you want in that dogfood! Naah naah man I ain't got none of that, but hold up a sec. At this point I'm ready to jet but he calls over a boy named booby. No shit. Booby . And booby says he can help us out but he needs to use my phone. So booby gets in my backseat (another rule broken) and makes two calls. I tell him I was looking for two buns and he says he just needs to go round the corner and the guy will meet us there. So around the corner we go. One minute later a new looking mustang pulls up and booby asks for my money (my buddy has remained silent during this entire scene) I ask booby how much and he replies 210 for both. Now I'm sweating thinking booby is just gonna get in the car and go. But my junkie cells demand I hand it over and see what happens. Booby doesn't even get in the mustang. Goes straight to the drivers window and walks straight back. ""Here dawg"" says booby. ""He left you his number on the top bundle, day or night nigga. The extra ten bucks was for me"" and walked away",1419303027.0

I live in one of the biggest cities outside of London so getting to another council is only a couple of miles.

Has anyone in the UK been allowed to recently start a maintance plan, either Methadone or Sub's with providing a positive sample? 

I mean I could go and use the day before the first appointment but would prefer not too. Also if I do, would DHC be enough or would it have to be morphine or H? 

Lastly I think sub's are definitely the right call for me. After the first few weeks I won't have to go daily to pick up methadone and its also going to male it doubly hard to use and feel anything. Does anyone think Methadone is the better choice? If so, why?

For one, a tourniquet creates more pressure in the vein which leads to more bexiting the vein and going into the surrounding tissue, this ends up in being a bruise and a hard region underneath the skin. 

That's really the big reason why I don't use one, because I think without it the area heals quicker, is less severe, and has less visible signs of IV drug use. ",1419279223.0

I have a fucking lot to say, but before I do, I'd like to preface this with the moment I realized that from there on out, I was going to be forever changed, and at this point, I am relatively certain that this is the beginning of the veritable end of my days; at least, the ones that might have some small amount of who I am or was or wanted to be in even the most slight attendance. I can feel myself starting to just allow the slow and inevitable suicide of who I am, who I was, and who I was supposed to have become. 

It is a small but important detail of the downward spiral this evening rapidly became to note that this is the second time tonight that i try to take the mess in my head and put it out of myself - the first draft was the most well written and honest and truly fucking good thing I have authored in a long motherfucking time. This tablet has never once crashed on me. Today, when I hit save, the fucker froze. That was the most speechless I have ever been - and the moment when i realized that perhaps, I am not completely insane in the notion that I am just not supposed to be allowed to bare this part of myself, that it wasn't just a case of technology being technology and failing for the first time in a year of having this thing without a single glitch; rather, genuine and tangible proof that i am, in fact, being punished by any and every single thing that possibly can cause me anyfuckingmore frustration. Then, it came back for a minute...and then, it was gone again, and I sat silent and beyond broken. As with every fucking single other good thing I have ever had in my life, I get close as close can be to the outcome or thing or whatever that i would like - and then it is gone, out of my grasp, unless to momentarily and even more brutally give my a glimmer of hope that always leads to the conclusion that i should have just never attempted doing the thing that would have made me happy. Sometimes, it really is just slightly easier not to fucking try. Even more proof of this? A fellow bropiate had been counting on me to help with something. I did, in fact, get it finished; however, I could not have even tried to have failed so miserably at the simplest part of the task - and as it stands, I am a complete and utter fucking disappointment. Even my body is failing, I fainted coming downstairs, and it fucking annoys the fuck out of me that i am fine. Well..physically. I am so far beyond the limits of mental and emotional and even embarrassment...I should have never even tried to help that bropiate. I am well intentioned, but fucking supremely more of an issue than the original issue itself..in fact, I could not feel more wretched about the whole thing if i tried. I'm to the point of paralysis. I am so completely terrified of being a part of this subreddit. You're the best and safest place I have ever found any sense of belonging and community within...and at this point, I am starting to fear that I will somehow fuck it up completely and to the point of disrepair.


I am rewriting this solely because I feel incredibly certain that this may very well be the most important and the most intimate thing i have ever managed to put into words; the revelation/conjecture/attempt at explaining the way that it feels to be tinfoildragon which I have ever managed to even remotely translate from the place inside myself that has been begging, screaming, kicking, dying to be heard, helped and understood for the entirety of my existence. The vast and truly profound depression into which I have been forever inducted this evening is at once the most ludicrous and the most obvious explanation for the purpose of this, the life that i cannot claim to have truly lived; rather, the person I am that is unworthy of existing outside of my inner monologue; in these dumb diatribes, the musings of a deeply disturbed and dumbfoundingly irrelevent junkie whore. The point is, I have been raised and conditioned to accept the fact that who I really am, the woman I know myself to be, is never going to be the woman that gets to exist. The revelation came last night when i realized that my mother was not kidding when she told me that i was not hurt by her actions, because the sick and inescapable reality I cannot find a way to accept is the fact that I exist in her life solely when i accept her version of the things she cannot know, but somehow always will hold the rights to control.

It is completely and utterly dehumanizing. It is also the way i have allowed myself to be treated by countless others who have slowly but surely left me with nothing but the void that has become the most incredibly and infinitely depressing fact that in 24 years of being here on Earth, I have yet to convince the people who are supposed to know me the very best that i exist outside the confines of the things I did not do the way they wanted me to do them. Nothing I have achieved on my own, none of the things I like about myself, not even the manipulation and the abuse they put me through exist, as far as they are concerned. I exist to be convenient, to corroborate the evidence of the life that they want to project - not to be a facet of the reality that isn't a figment of the fucking imaginative and perverse ways that my mother was always ahead of the Joneses...so long as the world her daughter learned to live in was nothing more than honing the skill of pretending not only to be someone else, but to pretend to be happy with the fact that the person I am was never going to be good enough for who and what I always have been.

Tonight, I am dumbfounded and beyond the point of even attempting to pretend that i have even the slightest remaining interest in living anymore, period. My parents have, for the last time I will allow and in the most incredibly and deeply cold, calculated, and cruel manner, hurt me so profoundly, intentionally, and deeply that I am to the point of no return. I simply do not fucking care enough, do not have the strength left over after a year of having been used so completely and without even the batting of an eyelash by my ex-fiance, by my ex-best friend, and in the cruellest iteration, by ma and pa. The fact of the matter is that at this point, if life doesn't hand me something truly and spectacularly fucking miraculous.....I will, instead of paying my rent for January, instead of pretending t believe that i still give a fuck about being alive after the way the people who were supposed to love me used me and threw me aside, I will instead buy enough heroin, Meth, whatever I can find and in quantities that will take me to Hell with a smile and be so infinitely more peaceful than trying and failing to ever be more than a scapegoat, than another year spent broke and lonely and under the constant pressure of wondering who is going to be the next person that crushes you for sport; how much more you are actually physically capable of having your heart broken, how much infinitely less of yourself is still alive beneath the layers of lies they tell you about somebody they can't even try to pretend is worthy of knowing, let alone, even really there, since they know so infinitely just how much your worth is completely based on the things they can be congratulated for, not the ones which they couldn't claim.

Trust issues. Daddy issues. The fact that between perfection and bullshit, your parents exist in a realm so fucking retarded that it is infinitely less than even worth fighting for, but the way they use your simple and mature desire to believe them when they lure you in with the promise of making new memories, of letting you into their lives as a grown woman with a lot to offer...and the instant and deafening sound of your final fuck for them disappearing quicker than the fleet ing instant you actually believed that your life might actually have a happy ending, that you didn't fight so hard for absolutrly nothing but a suicide pact that involves a junkie who is so much infinitely more, and at the same time, the way that I would literally prefer a monkey to bite my tit off and jizz into it for crack money than allow them to ever convincd te me to have the complete and utter lack of any respect for myself in ever signing a power of attorney with even so much as a stray fucking hair on my head being under their fuvking supervision.

I know that i should care, should fight, try, whatever.

Truth be told, all I want, is to die, and now. I am at a complete and utter loss for the next logical step. I am so unbelievably and wholly exhausted that at this point, I am just completely fucking broken, and so unbelievably fucking angry that those two fucking evil, vile pieces of shit cannot even pretend to even care at all about who the fuck their daughter actually is. My mother and father are the two most profoundly egotistic, delusional, narcissistic and completely fucking chickenshit losers I have ever had the misfortune of being related to. 

I am so profoundly confused and so thoroughly discouraged that at this point, I am for once completely speechless. At this point, something truly fucking miraculous is really the only way i would even consider entertaining even another week without taking the pain away forever.

Here's the REAL PROBLEM THO.... I just tried to shoot a nice strong shot and i got a little blood in the syringe but then got air bubbles, so I'm trying to find a good spot again and a little more blood gets in but I'm not able to register...not able to effortlessly pull a burst of blood into the barrel

then -so rapidly that it really upset me-the syringe is suddenly clogged. I'm wondering if this is because i hit the same vein i tried to hit earlier?

or does blood suddenly clot in a syringe sometimes?

or was this the dope itself? some weird reaction that made the blood clot rapidly?

Usually even when i get a little blood in there but partially miss i can effortlessly blast that blood into a different vein, it never clots like this. it's extra dark and it was so hard. i tried to just push it out and write off 1/8th of the barrel as a waste...but after running it under hot water and pressing with all my might i finally broke the plunger. now I've got a cooker filled with this bloody mess and idk what to do with it. this is a good deal of the point right here. 

I don't think snorting it would be very sanitary, and eating it wont have much effect, I am certainly not going to cook it and try to shoot it... i suppose it's just a waste and the longer it sits here the more dangerous it becomes. 

such a bummer, now I'm wondering what I did wrong, how i can avoid it, and if something weird really is up with this dope

please help, any help will be appreciated. 

I have one half cc of this point left.. really stretched it tho as i got 2 full cc and one half cc syringes out of it, i am going to try and use the half cc in a different vein and I already shit the other full cc. 

I am thinking i hit an area that is in the process of healing and ended up with some thick blood and when it went in the syringe it rapidly started clotting more, sound reasonable?

I AM SO CONFUSED AND LET DOWN. ",1419418672.0
2q9jvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2q9jvj/grey_dopexmas_gifts_for_yourself_and_fentanyl/,19,https://redd.it/2q9jvj,CryptoPharm,Grey dope???-XMAS gifts for yourself and Fentanyl pills make me wonder if they're cutting their dope.,"I wanted to do something special for myself for XMAS a half gram is the biggest bag I've ever gotten but on the 22nd I decided to get a full gram, i asked my boss to be paid for 5 and a half hours of work and went home with $140. 

I had a long shower and shot up in the shower for the first time, i used a shot i had mixed up early that morning and it was still very good. it was nice to have all that warm water touching my back as much as i could manage while keeping my arm extended and away from the barrage of relaxing hot water. 

I called The Crew and the newer guy said he only had three .3 bags left, and pressured me saying he's getting another call soon and i can take them and clear him out or wait for half gram bags...i stupidly said I'll wait. then the equivalent of chaos for regular heroin users struck, the crew couldn't get anything from the people they deal with and people were calling them all night-including myself- waiting to get something...and nothing happened. 

I called the younger 'kids' i used to buy from regularly, they'll call me when close by, suddenly they call and their sold out and not coming. So i got a little dope sick and reminded myself that if i ever save up enough cash I'm going to literally start stashing small bags of dope for a rainy day. So being dope sick fucking sucked. i asked the new guy on my favorite crew if he could hook something up outside of his employers cause he offered earlier and the next morning i woke up sicker and nothing had changed but luckily I had fallen asleep.

The young guys had nothing ""got everything , all the re-ups went well except getting that shit"" so i start thinking about a big police announcement like ""region wide bust"" or some other nightmare. 

Finally!the new guy from my favorite crew is literally in the building next to me called me right after i had just finished popping immodium and wondering how much my XMAS would suck and hating myselfd for not taking the 3- .3 bags...a point makes no difference and i wont make that mistake again. a big bag is a big bag. 

He asked me if I'd like him to come up and I opted for meeting him beside the old church by my house-now a daycare, odd choice but it was his option and i just rushed there excited as could be.....

But he only had ""50s"" .3 here, and i opted for a mix of the light tan chunks I'm used to and this new grey shit that smells strongly of vinegar.

I learned later that my own ignorance is truly deeper than imagined and that grey heroin isn't all that weird at all, and so I was hopeful and yet skeptical, the stuff i hear online is that it can be some great shit or it can be awful and colours are not to be the sorce of purity info- and i agree.

I also read many times that this grey dope comes out of Iran?-any truth to this?surely not all of it but enough of it for this to be true in many cases? 

I STUPIDLY shot the same old dope I often get (or that colour) first and some of the grey dope next, it didn't pack an amazing rush but i kept the shots light fearing a weird cut or some dope I couldn't handle etc, these were test shots. 

I've had some stronger shots since then and it does seem pretty good, at the very least it's got good legs, it just lasts and lasts..

I've heard some bad things like grey dope is dope that's old and degraded, even that it's turned back into morphine, but I've seen no good explanations of why this is true or references. 

I got three .3 bags -2 grey, -should have just been one but i was so eager i didn't notice or think about it until i was back upstairs and 1 regular bag that looks like the dope they have much of the time. 

Later today I wanted to get in touch with the younger guys again and the guy told me i had to know someone but my little bro is the one that gave me the number and he's in rehab for meth, i used to call them for months at the start of the year, they were my first regular crew but he was robbed last night and afraid to meet...but we were both being polite and I kept him on the phone and assured him I'm about 140lbs soaking wet, not a skilled fighter or a gangbanger...and that-felt this was my best piont- he can drive slowly past the meet location and if he's afraid to talk to me he can just drive away... that's the one the seemed to tip the scales.

I'll make this part of my simple little story shorter and say that I asked him or a 50 bag(.3) to get a good idea of their dope now and not the point he thought he was showing up for, he assured me that ""it's a lot better now"". 

Went home and like always the points were bagged individually and their stuff was loose grainy stuff, it tasted GREAT as in it tasted very bitter and just how the good dope I've gotten usually tastes and it disolved very easily and very quickly, when i shot it I felt a pretty good rush and I've been shooting a little bit of dope all day.... 

Between both bags I've got 1.1 grams of dope and I'm excited for XMAS dinner at my older bro's house, the only thing I really wanted for XMAS was dinner with close family members and with most of my family being spread out and far away and so few people willing to travel this time the dinner at my bros is the best thing on the horizon and perfect for XMAS day, I'm also glad I bought myself a present and got a little more dope than I normally would...

The only thing that raised an alarm bell is I called the guy from the young crew to tell him the dope is good and I'll put them back into my rotation ..and that if they ever come across hydromorphone or oxymorphone ""I'd be all over that shit"" and he said ""we don't deal in like morphine"" and i told him again I'm not looking for simple morphine and he told me they have fentanyl pills- again my ignorance astounds me and I find out online that fentanyl does indeed come in pill form but to hell with that if it's not heroin or one of my fave pharms i don't want it, and i think getting into the habit of shooting fentanyl on purpose might be very stupid.+

So then I'm thinking holy shit I hope this dope isn't cut...their delay in getting heroin while carrying pills and other drugs leads me to believe -more hope than believe-their not cutting their dope with it, but perhaps they buy so so dope and make it seem better by cutting it.

I sure as fuck hope not, I'm going to avoid using all morning and much of the afternoon then shoot the grey dope tomorrow and their dope the next day after abstaining for just as long. 

That should give me a better idea.

***I wouldn't even know where to begin other than a test kit to be sure their dope is mostly just heroin and not fent, I am going to get high after being sober and time how long i feel high.***

***From what I know/read if it lasts around one hour or less it's likely cut with fent, ANY OTHER GOOD WAYS TO FIGURE THIS OUT???***

***Have you ever gotten grey heroin? and just for fun maybe we could all chime in and name all the colours we've had?***

The grey stuff I have looks like some light grey-dark gray rocks I've seen before, like it belongs in a driveway, the two bags I got weren't even consistent among themselves...there's a great big light grey chunk and a bunch of much darker grey chunks. 

I've seen bright white, off white, white with speckles, brown, light brown..and now...grey. It lasts a long , long time but I want to try a strong shot after abstaining for awhile. even the weaker shots made it's harder to see the blood register compared to the yellow stuff I'm used to...i imagine that if it got really, really dark in the barrel that could be annoying.

I really like my regular dope that looks like piss after i mix it up to be honest.I should have asked specifically for 2 of what I'm used to and only one grey bag but i was just so eager to get some dope again and felt their operation was struggling with supply... i just wanted to go upstairs and sample the dope and figure it all out later-and hope that they sort it out and have lots and lots of the same white or tan dope I'm used the next time i phone. This grey shit doesn't smoke so well on foil but in the stem of an old vape bowl i can pull some nice tokes...it's not terrible heroin but I want the killer rush and the legs, never just one or the other....  it lasts a long time tho, so i hope a strong shot will give me the kind of rush i look for. 


With their usual stuff I know exactly what I'm getting when i mix it up, in the barrel if it's yellowish and light  orange and starting to look very dark HOLD THE FUCK ON, if it's light yellow like the piss of a fairly well hydrated person it's good but fine for going out to a family dinner or something

College aged, pseudo intellectual, somewhat lost, hoping to be found type people. I've had a few interactions with people that landed me in situations with people I would not normally associate it. 

In my times of desperation i've often thought of going to the homeless shelter. After hearing from numerous places that drugs are rampant in these places, I had avoided shelters throughout my drug use. I will admit I simply did not want to associate with homeless people, bums if you will. 

After tapering down and eventually quitting heroin about a month ago I found myself wandering downtown with an old friend. He was on a ton of methadone and xanax, just nodding everywhere and my addict senses were just going off. I got into a pissed I-gotta-get-high mode.

I made a promise to  myself that i'd get a medical card and just smoke weed from now on, as my life was a lot better as a pothead. Wondering where I could find a bag for a mere 10 dollars I turn my head and as it seems, we are across the street from the local homeless shelter. We head there, I, in an attempt to find weed, my friend, to find pills. 

Well the short story is that we both walked away very happy. On the street I run into a guy who took the longest hit of crack i've ever seen. Probably upwards of a minute long hit of crack. That let me knew I was in the right place. People had pills, boy, weed, everything. Shit i've been sick for days within a few minutes drive of this heavenly place?

I walked up to a guy my age and after we talked he rolled a huge blunt and we started smoking and talking. He was very glad that I had quit heroin and said he'd seen it ruin a lot of people. It turns out this guy was really cool and we ended up talking for like 30 minutes after smoking. I gave him my full 10 dollars before leaving. 

My friend found more pills and ascended into next level of 'high as fuck.' At this point I wasn't even talking to him anymore, more just pulling him along with me.

Basically I didn't know it before I went but I actually had a fear of going to the homeless shelter. This is pretty ignorant but it was a pretty set in fear, I now realize. The people there were cool and I actually got support in my quitting of opiates. In terms of drugs it was literally mecca. Maybe I just got lucky, I dunno. 

I guess the reason of this post is to say that if you've thought of scoring at a homeless shelter but haven't because homeless people scare you or you're just really like, middle class or something, it's really easy to go up and talk to people. they're not all nuts and some people are just going through a rough few months. not everyone that lives there will be there forever. shit you might end up there someday for a bit. 

On a unrelated note I just watched the movie slacker by richard linklater. It really struck a chord with me. It's about all these pseudo intellectual 20 something year old people in a college town who have interesting stuff to talk about but physically do nothing but eat, sleep, hang out, and not-work. This is totally me and I wish I had seen this movie before because I feel like i'm living out the movie in the most un-ironic and sad way. Sometimes if you are aware of something you an make a conscious effort to not be that thing, like a nazi or slave owner. I wish I realized earlier in life how many 20 somethings are directionless and because of that directionlessness delve into patterns that just cycle on until you die. I don't wanna talk about going back to school until i'm literally 60. I don't want to see shitty bands at dive bars anymore. damn yo like that movie really speaks to me, it really does. But in a positive way. I have this feeling of wanting to be the fish that actually swims upstream, the one guy that does something different.

THAT'S NOT HOW I ENVISIONED MY FUN CHEAT DAY.

It started innocently enough. Sitting in a Starbucks waiting for my friend who was fronted some, so I bought a little extra. Oops on my part.

After we do our first shots, I feel good, and he's high as fuck, so what does he do? He plops a huge chunk (tar) into my spoon and tells me to go again. I said DUDE THATS HUGE, so he takes half out, and leaves the bathroom.

I do the shot, and the minute I finish... I realize it was WAY too big for being 32 days clean. Way. Too. Big.

For the next 20 minutes, I had to clean up the bathroom, and TRY to get a hold of m arms and legs. I literally had no motor functions.

My mind never went. I never blacked. I think that's because of the meth in my system, otherwise I'd probably be dead.

We walked around outside, which is a lot less eventful than it sounds but I looked drunk as hell, and he dropped me off where I needed to be after confirming I'm good to go but I swear there were people chasing me. I could be wrong.

I ended up wandering off and these guys find me and wouldn't let me leave because an ambulance was on it's way.

When the EMTs picked me up my phone fell out of my pocket and nobody noticed. I can see it on iCloud now, whoever has it is not answering my calls... so it's gone :(

My body aches so bad from straining every muscle in my body trying to move.

Unfortunately, my holiday started off with a bit of a scare (fam emergency yesterday). My uncle will live, but it was still pretty scary.

JJ saved my ass yesterday. I had been going through w/d for a few days and was on my way to pick up when I got the call about my uncle.  I had to make the hour trip back home. 

Just when all hope of me re-upping before the holiday seemed to be lost, I get a call from my 'nect saying he was good.

For someone so wholly at a loss for words, I have entirely too much to say. The complete and utter lack of fucks I have left to give for myself or anything else, to be perfectly frank, is met only with the complete and unshakable truth that my life will never amount to more than a ceaseless collection of fuck ups and failures so pathetic that the sum total of my broken pieces is nothing more than a hilarious and nearly unfathomable waste of human flesh. 

I haven't the slightest of a clue what I'm doing anymore. Not that I did in the first place. I slept through the last appointment with a John I was supposed to pretend to give a fuck about, the appointment that would have paid my rent in full and allowed me the luxury of a few days rest. Of course I'd fuck up to that degree, manage to screw myself over that vastly. I spent 36 hours in my bed, writhing in the most excruciating waves of pain - my body ablaze with searing shockwaves that rendered it impossible to do much else than bawl and whimper - that I can still only attribute to the fact that at some point, I must have run out of the capacity to contain the emotional Hell in which I have existed for the past...fuck if i know. I don't really remember a time when life didn't just hurt. It was terrifying, and it led me to be more prepared and comfortable with the decision to end my life than I ever have been.

I think that at some point, we all flirt with the idea of suicide. I have certainly entertained the notion more than I would like to admit, and i have thought that i meant it before, but I was never as truly ready as I was about 8 hours ago. I prepared the shot, more heroin than necessary to kill a horse, let alone a 100 pound human female, wrote the note, enjoyed a final cigarette.

And then, my best friend called. I didn't even have to say a word - he knew, somehow. Called to beg me to try, to hold on just a little longer, to not be such a selfish and cowardly little bitch that I didn't fight just a little bit harder.

I hung up on him, livid and broken beyond any depth of which I ever have been before. I shattered into an infinity of the things I have never been, lost in a void of the things i fear that i never will become. Is it possible for someone so insignificant and infinitely subpar to become more than a lifetime's worth of suffering, both undeserved and self induced? 

For better or for worse, I am giving myself one final and painful attempt to become someone who truly exists. I am sitting in the airport, awaiting a flight back to the city I despise almost as much as i loathe myself. I am resigned to the fact that I don't deserve to exist, and though everyone around me sees this as the first thing if ever done because I give a shit about myself; the very opposite is true, I am allowing the hatred I have for who I am to become the last ditch effort to find meaning in a meningless life. In handing over the rights to my existence to the two people I hate the very most in the whole fucking universe, I am truly committing the most complete suicide imaginable.

I have never truly existed. There is a person deep inside of me that stopped trying to escape into the realm of the living long, long ago. There are only so many times a person can be told that who they are is unworthy before they cease any attempt to be anything more than completely invisible. 

I know now with absolute certainty that i never will truly exist. In allowing the rest of the world to ""fix"" me, to decide who and what I should present to the world, what pretty little fake facade is an acceptable enough version of the infinite lie that they want me to tell, the falsification of who I am not, but will forever be resigned to pretending that I am, I sign not only the rights to my existence but the death warrant that will be the infinite and ultimate punishment upon which I myself bestow.

Death would have been too easy. I do not deserve such a simple out.

How I manage to constantly and consistently find myself at lower lows and rockier bottoms isn't even a question I allow myself to  entertain anymore. There was, in fact, a short lived but somewhat critical chapter of my life that was defined by the cosmic game of truth or dare that I semi-consciously undertook as player 2 against the dark mistress known only as Life and her bedfellow, the Eternal Footman. A strange pair to stare in the eye without even the desire to finch, but for about a third of a year, i reveled in the certainty that only uncertainty can provide. Fuelled by caffeine, the thrill of chasing deeper holes to crawl into, more impressive opportunities to disappoint the then captive and naïve audience of family and friends that marveled at the freakshow I call life, the adrenaline that came with knowing that odds were good that not only could my story get infinitely more interesting, but cut short at any wrong turn, i took risks so risky that i look back with both disgust and a sick sense of respect and awe for both the recklessness and the sense of infinty that i still had t the time. I still do, to some degree; however, it is defintely becoming more measured and less reckless as the days go by. Dont get me wrong, i am still batshit crazy with a reckless abandin that few even try to understwnd; however, in writing this passage, i find myself both mourning and rejoicing the days of my youth that are starting to be replaced with a (mild) thirst for stability. Im by no means ever gonna be the housewife kind; however, having a savings account and perhaps one day a mortgage are notions i am warming to; tangible waye in which i see myself metamorphosing yet again - growing old might be inevitable, but growing up is optional. Im getting there. Slowly. That is a bizarre thing to finally want to admit. I digress. I look back upon the days of delusional and false immortalty and cant help but miss them. The sheer lack of regard for myself, the insane air of bravado...it was, at the time (and arguably still) the most impressive and potent drug with which I had let myself truly experiment, purposefully dangling myself at the precipice between more and more intensity and overdosing on reality. The fact that my life has resembled a choose your own adventure novel for so long makes it hard for me to feel comfortable with the things that normal adult relationships are based upon. Plans made more than a day in advance? Not happening, cap'n. Social gatherings where I'm expected to bring something to share always trip me up - when did that start to mean ambrosia salad instead of pot brownies and mushroom tea? Basically, I am sucking at this whole social thing, unless we can call into consideration my comsiderable skill at cold copping on Hastings. It is, in fact, a skill. Learning how to gauge who the best person to ask for what drug and in varying qualities, quantities and varieties is a testament to the hoursminutesdaysmonths I have spent bothieties ane buying and selling drugs from all varieties and sorts of people and places. Driving around in the passenger seat keeping the boys company on three day crack drives taught me about desperation; importing bricks of cocaine taught me how bribery and politics work, dealing dimebags of ganja in university taught me how it feels to be everybody's best friend, and my recent adventures copping points and flaps has left me grateful for the street knowledge that a truly rare and bizarre few of us can say that we have honorary doctorate degrees in, at this point. Like I said, the most truly impressive of my skills are never going to make it onto my curriculum vitae; however, at this point, the fact that I am this non chalant in cracking jokes about the things I learned to do in the cover of the night, the things that we shrouded in so many layers of half baked security that looking back, I am relatively certain that we sometimes only made the whole task both more tedious and no more secure, but the junkie mind is a curious and silly beast. As both usage and time spent with both junkies and their various substances increase, the behavio urs and patterns become their very own code. This is not a skill nor a habit that is easily forgotten - to this day I can spot a crackhead mile away, determine with near perfect accuracy whether that opiate high is pharmaceutical or horse. These are the skills you don't start out noticing yourself honing; however, it comes in handy; in particular, for avoiding dope sickness, finding your crowd at parties, and in starting new phones.

And, since we are on the topic, holy FUCK am I ever glad that I took the day for the sake of my mental health and my Christmas stash acquisition. I have another couple of folks that i need to see tomorrow to make sure that I'm covered, but I'm actually pretty sure that I'll be able to forget the crushing depths of my loneliness - i should really slow my Meth roll...but its so cheap, and i can already see the weight falling off. This..and the high is secretly one of my top three. It really isn't even that intense, it just adds and extra layer of..more, somehow. Like.. reddit, vs. Reddit gold.

I live in a two bedroom townhouse with my boyfriend. We've been living here for a year and a half, and during that time, we've let other people stay with us, but it usually ends badly without them paying us.

So it was really against my better judgment to let my friends stay here. We'll call them C (girl) and B (dude) and they are a married couple who recently had a baby. Only B is working, and he basically makes pocket change - his check was a little over $300 for the last two weeks, and he worked full time. They end up garnishing so much of it for child support or who knows what. Also, they have a car payment of over $400 a month. They've had that car for a while, but they obviously can't really afford it.

My boyfriend and I pay $675 a month, plus utilities. I always always pay the rent before I do anything else, because I was homeless for YEARS before we came to live here. So we told C and B they could pay us $300 for the rent and just $50 flat for the utilities every month and they could stay.

I told them this BEFORE they moved in. They wanted to move in way before I let them, because I said from the beginning, the money has to be paid upfront. I have to pay my rent upfront, so should you guys. And when I have let people slide, well, you know, I never ever see that money. But every time they've gotten paid, there has been some issue about the money. I originally expected them to pay the $300 up front and the $50 from the next check. They asked, wouldn't I prefer to get it split in two, so I wouldn't spend my money all at once? I said, ...not really, but if that's what you guys can afford, I will work with you on a two week basis. Of course, this week, they tried to say, wouldn't you rather have the money all up front? As in, all up front in two weeks? No, definitely not okay to be 15 days behind on rent, and you have to give us something. So they ended up giving us $100.

And it's just all drama with them, I can't approach them about anything without it being a big freaking blow up. They don't communicate AT ALL. And I hate to fight. So I end up just avoiding them a lot. A few weeks ago, I said I know you guys are struggling. If you let me spend $50 of your food stamps for food for the house, I will forget about the utilities payment. Well they went and bought some groceries for the house, and didn't ask what I wanted, or if I wanted to go or anything - And I guess C thought that meant we were even. I expected them to come back and let me grocery shop when they were done, but they sold all the link to somewhere else. Anyway, I mentioned offhand to C that they still owed the $50 and she LOST IT. She said nothing she ever does is good enough for anybody, they are going to lose the car, and then B won't be able to go to work, and then they'll be homeless, and she'd rather just die, and she should just kill herself. And then tried to bully me into dropping it saying well we miscommunicated, that's not my fault, I did buy groceries, if I had known you were gonna pull this I wouldn't have bought any groceries. (She can't possibly expect that she's going to pay $350 and that's it and my boyfriend and I will provide all the food and household needs and toiletries and etc.) And then she tried to tell me, she wouldn't mind giving me the rent if it actually went towards paying the rent, but I just spend it on dope so she shouldn't have to give me the money.

My money goes to dope because I ALREADY paid the bills. It was just such a ridiculous argument and I was so flabbergasted. They ended up paying it, but it was such a hassle. It's always a hassle. Every time.

Anyway, there are countless examples I could give. She brings dudes over to my house to trick and make money, lies to her husband about it, they fight and scream and hit each other and then chase each other around the parking lot screaming. She eats all my food all the time. She's always trying to beg a spare cap off me. Even telling me she wants to die and kill herself if she can't get high, and that's not fair, to put me in that position. And it's just been a freaking nightmare the whole time. And she acts like she's doing us such a big favor by staying here and giving us that money, but we don't need the money. We are doing them a favor.

So this week, they short us on rent payment by $75. They turn around and buy $50 of dope from my dealer right in front of me. She owes me and my boyfriend dope, but she doesn't offer to pay it back. She tricks later that day, makes more money, spends that all on dope too. The next morning, I try to ask her to give me a ride to pick up and offer to PAY THEM gas money and dope to do it, even though THEY OWE ME, and they say they're too tired and basically too lazy to do it.

She's been complaining she was going to be alone for Christmas, etc. I invited her to come to my family with us but she didn't want to. So today my boyfriend and I go to see my family. We REALLY planned ahead to have dope to do on Christmas so we wouldn't get sick. Which is amazing, because I am really, really, REALLY terrible at planning ahead. So I do some of my stuff and take a bit with me to my family's house just to snort, and leave some in my kit. So does my boyfriend.

We come home, after having a GREAT time with my family, and both of our kits have been gone through. The stuff we left in them is gone. And my boyfriend's tourniquet is just missing.

I happened to be able to pick up before coming back home, so I am lucky to have more stuff - but what if that had been all I had??? Because I was expecting it would be. But apparently, after I have given them a place to live, let them slide on rent money and food and all kinds of stuff, and even GIVING HER AN OPPORTUNITY to make some dope yesterday, she got in our kits and fucking stole our shit.

I'm so angry and hurt and frustrated. She always says she's my best friend, she'd never fuck me, etc. I don't know if she thought I wasn't going to notice (???) or what. But I am just stunned. I remember being homeless, and if someone had been awesome enough to help me the way I have helped them - I would NOT be treating those people badly or STEALING from them. I just really can't believe it. And instead of just coming clean, my boyfriend knocked on C's door, and she straight lied and said she had no idea where his tourniquet was.

I also suspect it was all C. Whoever took that dope had to have shot it, because it was already wet. And B doesn't shoot. And just knowing her for this long, and her personality - I suspect she took B to work, came home dopesick, and raided both of our kits. So B is gonna get the blow of it too, even though I don't think he had anything to do with it.

I really want them to get out tonight, I am so mad. There have been a variety of issues already and I have already been wanting them to leave, but this is the icing (and the sprinkles and the candles even) on the cake. My boyfriend says we should sit down and talk to them when B gets home from work and address the issue. He doesn't want me to do anything drastic to kick them out, and if I do want them gone, he wants me to wait at least until tomorrow. But he said them getting out or not was up to me.

What should I do, /r/opiates? Should I make them get out? Should I make them get out, but wait till tomorrow? Should I try to reach a resolution but let them know they are on very fucking thin ice? I'm not sure. I'm conflicted. I thought she was my friend and I really did want to help them. I also feel bad because it's Christmas. Also I know this argument is going to be ridiculous, and she's going to take her argument to her grave and try to turn the tables on my boyfriend and me somehow. I just don't know. It's just all so ridiculous.



And PS - MERRY CHRISTMAS /r/opiates! I love this sub and I look at it everyday. I hope everyone had a rocking day. I know JJ looked out for me, and I hope he was around for everyone else too.



EDIT (from my phone, sorry typing): well, they came home, and my SO asked them to sit down and talk. C acted like she had no idea what we were talking about but we made some pretty valid points and then we just said they had to go. B just I think was exhausted and kind of stunned and I really do feel bad because he had NO IDEA when he walked in that there was a problem at all. But we said they had to get out, B cut C off and said that was fine, and they are packing their things now.",1419566703.0

so let me start with this. a few days ago a fellow redditor came to me , a stranger, but a redditor none the less needing an opiate related favor. in my mind i saw it as i would hope someone would do the same for me. you know how junkies got this rap that they're only out for #1 and will hustle anyone for what they want? well i HATE that shite coz i don't agree with that. i'll help a mate out if they're sick and need a bag of somethin to get well. 
so after i helped this redditor out i got to thinkin. this a lovely community we got here of like minded brothers and sisters and it would be a sin to beat someone from the crew. right? so i decide then to reach out to some of these mates coz i never thought to do that before. bad idea.
since then i've talked to a few of these kids and all i've seen out of the five or six i've spoken to is that same old stigma attached to us addicts. bein JERKS. lookin out for no one but them. dont want to help a mate out unless they gettin somethin from it. a LOT of somethin from it. i'm sure you all have some experience with this. but it really got me down. no wonder we've all got this stigma attached to us. i thought it a sin to not help out a fellow bropiate but i thought wrong. 
anyone have any thoughts? dont have to be reddit related. love to hear from you all. happy holidays mates.

Nothing serious, but lately my depression and anxiety has gotten worse since a recent serious car accident, and I've been using more often. In the last month I've spent $400 on Dilaudid. Part of the problem is it comes from a friend who can't work and it's his only source of income. He lives right down the street, and always saves me 20-40 for whenever I come calling.

I've decided to quit, probably for the strangest reason. I love mineral collecting and today I was in a beautiful little shop that had this gorgeous piece of petrified wood. I looked at the price tag and it was $92. I instantly became sad because I realized I could have had this amazing piece of natural history 4 times over with the amount I've spent on just a stupid high, and with that I realized I need to quit. I've got 4 d's left and I'll be taking them tonight to help with my flu but after tonight I'm done. Already called my buddy and told him to stop holding for me, which he was totally fine with, and actually a little happy that I was quitting because he had also noticed my habit was increasing, and had been contemplating asking me if everything was ok.

I'm not worried about WD, I can deal with that pretty easy. My main concern is I really had lost a passion for life, and opiates helped me to fix that. When I'm high I get into conversations, I open up to people, I love to help people, and I enjoy all the things in life that I used to. I love playing video games, listening to music, or going out to dinner. When I'm sober all I seem to be able to do is wake up, go to work, come home and then sleep for 13-14 hours and just do it all over again. So my question to you folks is how do you deal with the boredom that comes rushing back in? How do you find the energy to be passionate about life? Thanks for any advice, and the read.",1419562133.0

After I picked up my boy and we pooled out money we were 10$ short on a bundle and we were pretty bummed about it but we sucked it up and headed up to link up with my connect.  

When we got there he not only gave us a full bundle even tho we were 10$ short BUT he also gave me another bundle for free so that I could try it out because apparently a new person had bagged his shit up for him and he needed to know if it was still as flame as it normally is.  

AND THEN when I got home and reported back to him about the quality (it was not as good as it normally is BUT it was still a 6/10 when normally it is a 8/10) he told me to come back tomorrow and he would have another bundle he needed me to critique for him. 

Whenever I have performed as a tester for a dealer iv only ever been given enough for one dose BUT this dude gave me enough for at least three nice size shots which is obviously beyond awesome.  

This dude is probably one of the best dope dealers i have ever had.  He's always on time, he's never late.  He is never short, in fact he will randomly throw an extra bag or two into every other order. He will also do fronts of varying amounts if I ask him (I very rarely ask for fronts of more than enough to get off EMPTY because I'm a junkie and iv got bad self control and the last thing I wanna do is piss him off because a) he's a good dude and he's always on point  b) he has the best dope in his  small PA city that is flooded in subpar untaped bags of shitty dope.

2qeqk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2qeqk5/its_becoming_more_and_more_clear_warning_wall_o/,20,https://redd.it/2qeqk5,ThrowawayBags,It's becoming more and more clear (WARNING: WALL O' TEXT),"WARNING: THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNG OF TEXT AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT.

It's undeniable and inescapable at this point that I truly am an addict without a doubt. As I write this I'm taking breaks snorting lines of heroin locked in the upstairs bathroom of my parents house. They think I'm sober and like the piece of shit addict I am I've done everything I can to maintain this image. I've been caught a couple times. I'm in my 20's and have a great job with a bright future that pays decent. I'm in school for it but it's not a college so it's very cost efficient education wise. I say this not to brag but to explain how important it is I not get caught and how stupid I am to risk it all. My parents made it very clear last time I was caught that if caught again they will no longer let me live in their house. 

I don't know how it happened, slipping back into heroin that is. Well, I do. I thought I was fucking special. I thought because I'm in intellectual and intelligent I could beat heroin at its own game. I was confident I would use heroin and not the other way around. Boy was I wrong. I always make sure my bills are paid then I use basically all my money on heroin. I usually end up calling the various places I have bills to get extensions and what not or sometimes I'll go negative in my checking account. 

The past few weeks, maybe even months, I keep telling myself every time I have like 0 dollars I'll be stopping now for a few days or weeks or hell maybe for good this time. But as soon as day 2 of withdrawal comes along something very disturbing happens and for some reason lately I've been extremely conscious and aware of it. Whatever it was I promised myself while not in withdrawal just disappears. I usually don't start WD for 24 hours so even when I'm not high but not sick I'll make this problem and I feel good about it and look to turn this around.

This shouldn't be a surprise to any addicts and its not to me but I've just been very conscious about it lately so its been disturbing me. Let this be a warning to any addicts who are early on or opiate users not YET addicts. As soon as those WD's hit or I get even the tiniest idea of copping dope there's just no control over my actions anymore. I'm not how I was before when I start heroin where I stole and pawned and scammed. This is mostly because I have a much larger income but every time I set a monetary limit for myself it gets broken.

I write this because I wasn't going to grab today but for some reason when I was driving home from my family's party for Christmas I just had the tiny idea pop in my head to grab. I told myself yesterday was going to be it but the idea is like one of those kids toys that are basically gel capsules with a sponge inside shaped like various animals such as dinosaurs. It starts as a passing idea like meh should I grab then all of a sudden my brain adds water and it explodes into a huge thing taking over my whole brain and being. I can't stop it no matter how hard I try. For this reason I'm so scared and petrified.

I have access to buprenorphine/naloxone in the form of Suboxone strips. But the first couple days like the first 4 it's still very very hard to fight the WD and its so hard to function even with the help. I know I'm being a pussy but that's just how it is. As I just did 8 bags and have 1.5 left. There's basically no money left in my account so I am done until next Thursday but I always say this every week. I'm so scared because I actually do want to stop for the first time but its hard. Right now I'm averaging around a bundle a day although I usually go like a day or so between each use due to money. For example I'll buy say 1.5 or 2 buns and it'll last like 2 days then I'll not use again for like 36 hours or so. So I average like 3.5 - 4 buns a week. I just had to get this off my chest because I'm living a double life. No one except the ""friend"" I cop with knows I do heroin now. It's so hard and painful to keep all this pent up and all these secrets inside me. It's crazy and I just want to shout it to everyone about how much I've let them all down and how big of a fuck up I am. I truly am going to try and stop this time. Like I said I have subs to try and keep the WD at bay. So wish me luck and thanks everyone for listening to me bitch and moan like a pussy.

TL;DR: I'm an addict and want to quit and its very hard. Just bitching and moaning.",1419558173.0

So I'm trying to draw this stuff up, and it's a smidge thicker than usual. I didn't really know what to do, so I put a little bit more water in it, and drew it up into my syringe.

so i have 8 left now and i kind of feel like i should just finish everything off by tmrw night so that i can start withdrawing on sunday and be able to take a sub sunday night. i think that might be better than finishing my last bag on sunday and having my first day clean on monday. so i figured i finish tmrw night whenver since i dont have work on sunday it doesnt really matter. then take a sub when i start withdrawing and it hits the ~2o hour mark. because honestly i know that even with conserving, id make it to sunday at most and have my first day of withdrawal be on monday and not even be able to take the sub till monday night or something depending on when i finish. either way i kind of dont want to start my clean day on the first work day of the week.. i mean i know i'll be sick either wat but i prefer the first day of withdrawal to be on a weekend so i can just relax in bed instead of having to turn my brain on. so what would u guys do? finish everything by tmrw night so you can take a bit of sub on sunday night/? or taper sort of and take a certain amount tmrw and finish my last bag on sunday so id take a sub maybe monday morning or something. wat would you guys do?the unfortunate thing is that i've tried both methods before countless of times. always when i tell myself that this is the last pick up. but i hope to god this i my last and i feel more of a conviction this time than i did the past few times. but then again, i only have this motivation to quit while im high.. once the sober train hits, i get hit hard and it feels like it came from left field. i can never fully prepare myself mentally or physically for the shit show that is withdrawal


**TL;DR**
i bought 2 buns yesterday (friday) at around 2 PM. am still up right now at almost 5 AM. have 8 maybe 8 and a half stamps left. am trying to get clean for good after this batch. should i finish the rest tmrw night so that i can start withdrawing sunday and be able to take a sub sunday night. or should i just try to sort of taper down and finish on sunday and take a sub on monday when i have work. what would u do? because i can finish 8 easily..",1419672173.0

All of them are embarrassing and basically just all around terrible habits.   A doctor or therapist would probably just say that my drug use amplifies my dermatillomania/CSP (compulsive skin picking). 

Whenever I'm high I always...

####1) Popping pimples/black heads.  
I will tear myself apart popping pimples or trying to get rid of black heads.

###2) Picking scabs  
I won't just scratch at skin that doesn't already have a scab  there BUT I always end up turning a small scab or paper cut into a giant scab

####3) I always find myself stretching my arms/ legs/ fingers/ neck randomly.  I don't hold the stretch for any longer than 2 or 3 seconds.  Regardless of how much I stretch I'm completely unable to find relief or satisfaction and I  continue to have to do it.  Iv had running partners who found it absolutely annoying because I was always stretching.

###4) biting the skin on the inside of my mouth/lips/cheeks.  

This has been getting really bad recently.  I don't just gnaw at the skin i actually bite it off and swallow it.  I am literally eating myself.  This started about 3-4 weeks ago when I was just kind of biting the inside of my cheeks and the inside of my lips towards the corners of my lips. and then when I woke up the morning after the first time there were a bunch of spots that hurt a lot but after I did my morning shot I couldn't help myself and ended up biting what had healed off and biting more.  I had to stop doing it on the exterior lip area because it looks all bloody and scabby.  The spots that hurt the most are the most satisfying and I end up biting those off.  I took a picture to help illustrate the effects of this BUT honestly I'm sort of embarrassed with how gross it looks SOOOOO if have any questions just PM me and I'll try my best to explain it to you. I wonder if this makes my lips look fuller/plumper/bigger because they are hella swollen from me chewing them to shit.  What I enjoy about this is how much it hurts, the more it hurts the more I enjoy it.  When I wake up in the morning and the drugs are no longer as strong as they were the night before it hurts so intensely and I feel so ashamed of what iv done BUT then I do my wake-up and I'm right back to literally eating the inside of my mouth. 

####5) chain smoke cigarettes.  
Even just smoking a second cigarette without 2/3 hours in between only happens when I'm high or drunk.

So what do my junkie brethren find themselves doing as soon as their pupils constrict and the horse makes your voice horse?

I'm 25, and since I'm 15 I've been dealing with pain. I'm not sure what I have and neither is my doctor. My back, my knees, my elbows and my neck are fucked up.

Since I've been taking opiates not only did it take those problems away, but it actually also helps my bipolar disorder for which me and my doctor can't seem to find anything that works.

Now I'm in withdrawal. It's really not so bad even though I was taking at least 2mg of fent with some oxy or heroin.
But, my pain issues are back, and I had forgotten just how horrible suffering every single fucking day is to me. Especially since I don't have any help for it.

I'm just kinda lost as to why I feel this way. I know that WD gives you pain and all that but aside from being hot and cold and sweating, I'm just back to the old me. The old me, doesn't want to help out or do anything because he's always hurting and he feels trapped in a prison of pain with no way out! It's some kind of torture I should say.
I've been reading a lot on Endorphin Deficiency Syndrome and it kinda makes sens. I just go back to being in pain because my brain never really produced endorphins so it can't really get down-regulated...
Just looking for some input even if what I wrote probably doesn't make sens...

Praise JJ and the 4th amendment.,"So today I was driving with my middle man in a black area of a southern town. I turned in front of this car that was going faster than I thought because I left my contacts at home. Lo and behold I see lights. The only thing I have on me is a rig in my jacket pocket. My friend has half a bar. So the cops pulls us over and runs my friend and my ID. He is a felon and has a prison number, and I have recent paraphernalia for a one hitter that the cop illegally searched and found in my car. Anyways the cop calls for backup and I'm sitting their nervous as hell. I took some k pins earlier this day but to a trained eye you could tell I was under the influence. 
So eventually a bunch of cops show up and they ask me questions and I tell them no you can't search me or the car. So the cop tells me to get out to sign the ticket and in the process another pig comes up to me and starts to search me I told him "" hey you cant do that 4th amendment rights"". (keep in mind my baby rig is in my jacket pocket) so he asks me if I have any guns and I said no and he starts to ""pat me down"" I tell him hey you cant do this and he says it's for officer safety and forcefully spreads my legs. Anyways he pats around my pockets and so on and pats right where the tiny 30cc rig is and doesn't feel it through my leather jacket ( thank you grandpa for the old thick jacket!!!). He doesn't feel it and tells me to get back in the car. Then they tell me to get back out and come sign the ticket on the hood of their car. I then stumble back a bit when he shines the light in my eyes. He asked me what I was on, and I proceeded to tell him my adderall was wearing off and I was quite tired. They then ask my friend if I was fucked up and he said no I've been with him all day blah blah blah. Our cover story was we were cousins. He then told the cop I get like this once my addy wears off. So the cop makes me sign the bullshit ticket I can't read, and then sends me on my way where I promptly go to get a half g of some fire down south rocky powder. I got lucky as fuck. Always assert your rights!! The funny thing is I pissed off the cop who forcefully spread my legs. Anyways I should stay away from that area for a while. Dodged a bullet the size of a felony ( second paraphernalia charge is a felony) and a trip to one of the worst jails in the country, still got my sack and got high. Moral of the story fuck the police, and wear your contacts.   ",1419643836.0

The Hydro alone aint cutting it, fun time wise.  I have not had much experience with alcohol, but have considered picking up a high quality bottle of Vodka and trying a shot with my daily dose of Hydro.  I have a week off work and thought it might help intensify the hydro back to the pre tolerance levels.

Any thoughts?  I'm not talking downing a bottle of vodka a day, just a shot glass full.  Like I said, I have very little (read near 0) experience with alcohol.

Also, how long will the alcohol be detectable via a pee test.  I have 3 weeks before my next office visit and they didnt pee test me last time, so they probably will this time.  I have given them no reason to suspect I am doing anything wrong so far, dont want a funky test result, but Im guessing Alcohol leaves your system pretty quick.

I also want to make sure that I'm not getting ripped off, my guy initially tried to charge me $25 per because he thought it was hydromorphone, but he apologized and payed me back after he realized his errors. I got a good deal on an acute transaction, but he says that in the future it will increase to like $8-10 each. Is this too much? I looked at other prices and it seems like this guy just has his head up is ass and it's bugging me cause I don't want to ripped off.

Yesterday I read up on Layne Staley.,"I was reading what was supposedly his last interview where he said that he is at the point where heroin is no longer enjoyable because he was just using to avoid being dope sick. He said he knew he was dying and that he hated how much he needed drugs in order to maintain.  The article made me incredibly sad. Here is this man who is 6'1, 86 fucking lbs, covered in bruises and abscesses,  his teeth are falling out, he's vomiting all day and shiting his pants and just a few years earlier in his life, he was essentially a talented,  attractive rock god. 

My point is that I've never banged,  I've never even tried heroin or coke. I have two kids, severe depression and addiction issues so I don't think I will ever trust myself to try either of those drugs because I know myself and I would let it eat me alive. I guess I just wonder what some of you think about when you hear stories like Layne's. Does it scare you? Does it make you wonder if you're strong enough to never end up like him? 

I'm hoping this turns into a real discussion.  I've been wanting to post about Layne and Bradley Nowell, Chris Farley, and whoever else comes up in the conversation.",1419704812.0

You see addiction portrayed in movies as this depraved life of squalor. Constantly searching for your next fix as a desperate junkie or alcoholic or speed freak, whichever. As an admittedly dependent heroin user I can attest to how untrue the archetype for addiction can be. I buy a gram and binge for at most 20 days but normally it only lasts 2 weeks. No one suspects my use besides my ex-girlfriend who is hundreds of miles away. An average using day consists of waking up and shooting roughly 50mg of heroin into whichever vein will take it. Then I attend all my classes with an unmatched enthusiasm by my peers.

How could I even ask them to be enthusiastic? Today it’s dark and raining, maybe their girlfriend is being a bitch again. They’re worried about the test we have next week. Not me though, I can’t even conceive the notion of worry. I’m on another plain. Soaring above them I can look down on their petty problems and scoff.

I believe the greatest gift God gave us is the ability to choose. Heroin was never pushed on me, in fact it was quite the opposite. I read about heroin on the internet in high school. Rarely was it romanticized but the effects were accurately described. Bliss, euphoria, dilated eyes and most important of all; the intense rush that runs to me with arms wide open. Embracing me in a blanket of warmth comparable to nothing else on earth. I chose to find heroin in my shitty city. Today I choose to keep her around. While everyone else deals with worry beyond their control. I control my worry with the push of a plunger.

The other day I thought about my life and the implications of my use. Am I depressed? Bored? Or just a spoiled fuck who gets whatever he wants. That one wasn’t a question. Do I feel better than those around me, or do I feel so unwanted I hide myself in drug use. I don’t know or honestly really care. I serve one God and he is me. Fulfilling my desire to get high while maintaining all the things I’ve achieved is my only motive. Many addicts fall deeply in love with the hedonistic life style of drug use. I won’t be a fool and neglect other aspects of my life while getting high. My school work never falters, my friends aren’t the wiser, and my family loves me more than ever. Why am I to feel ashamed of occasional drug use?

There is a catch though. Withdrawals are hell on earth. The way I see it you have to pay back what you owe the devil for all the good felt during use. The damage to my body is minimal, comparatively speaking my alcoholic friends destroy their body to a much greater extent than I. There is also a certain self-loathing that comes with heroin use. One must be prepared to die with every shot. Dying would be the last fuck you to everyone who loves me. Which wouldn’t bother me besides for my immediate family.

When you’ve tasted the forbidden fruit there is no going back to apples. I have in many ways lost my lust for life. Kind of like using cheat codes in a video game I have broken the rules, rendering the game boring. I still enjoy seeing my friends, but binge drinking and attempting to get laid is boring. Why have sex with a girl when you can feel a rush that surpasses any orgasm? Additionally girls are people with thoughts and emotions that I truly don’t care about. Sex is the marriage of two bodies in the grossest way possible. Call me a prude but when you think about fucking it is pretty nasty. You can probably guess that heroin also robbed me of my sex drive. I don’t mind though, because with the power of choice I can simply not use and have the sexual energy of a 14 year old boy. I’ll wait for a girl I love and have sex that means something besides satisfying some primate instincts.

Heroin has me in her clutches and I don’t mind. She treats me right for now and gives me a purpose. No existential crisis here. I know exactly what I live for.",1419953814.0

It hurt like crazy to the point some days I could not use my right leg at all. I had surgery summer 2011 and got it removed causing the pain to go away which is awesome. I felt relief that I could walk like a normal person and did not have worry about it getting worse.

In 2013, I was stretching my right leg like I do everyday and felt in area where my mass was before (scar feels so smooth and nice). I felt a golf ball size lump on my bone stretching about 4 inches. At first i thought it was scarring from surgery and thought nothing of it but when I went to the specialist he said it was another osteocondroma near the one previously removed. Yeah I know fml

Present day, I have been going to a specialist in northwestern medicine up at Chicago,IL for past two months talking with him and setting a surgery date (end of next month). I also asked my specialists nursing assistant about what to do about pain meds and he says to talk to my primary doctor... Now here comes my questions.

 I am going to a new doctor to get my physical (going to be new primary doctor) how do I mention pain medicine that will work? Instead of getting stuck with ""take tynol""... like that works. Also, should I bring my past medicine on a printout to show what i was taking for it before (tramadol)? And my main thing is with tramadol is that even if I eat and take anti-nausa I still puke so how would I talk to him about switching to a narcotic til my surgery.

Keep in mind he is a new doctor and I dont want to push but coming home after working 8-10hours on my leg is starting to take a toll on me mentally. My nerve in my leg is actually sitting on the tumor so when I move it they rub together. It feels like at times a rggid pole moving up my leg or someone is stabbing me from inside my leg.

**Tldr - Leg in alot of pain from tumor. Was previously perscribed tramadol but make me sick. Seeing new doctor in few days and want new medicine that actually works til I get it removed at end of january.

For the most part, if I have opiates, I am doing them that night. Of course, this is a terrible plan, that leads nowhere but tolerance increase and ultimately addiction.

Last Monday, I picked up a bun, and did four bags. I have been using on a regular amount throughout Nov and December, but not so regular to have a habit. So the four bags got me nice but not rocked. I decided I was fucking tired of it. The previous week, I picked up a bun on Monday and it Wed it was all gone and I was all out of money. I decided I was going to do it different this time.

One week. That was the goal. One week until I use again, even though I had six beautiful bags of dope  just waiting for me to be used. I have to say, on more than one occasion, I came very close to caving in and just using. But I didn't. I stayed on the path. And here we are, a week later, and I am rocked off three bags.

Overall, my experiment was a great success. I want to keep it this level of usage. No more than once a week, and I can maintain a euphoric level of dope usage. I knew that I could, in theory, wait a week to use again even though I had the dope, but I'd never actually done it before.

The monster was too dry, too painful, too sharp! 
I pushed off, and started in with the water drinking and Metamucil. Throughout the day I must have made six trips to the bathroom to push away. Each time more depressing and painful than the last. This thing felt like a petrified cactus. 

I was beginning to feel defeated. And I felt so full of crap. So bloated. So sluggish. You know the feeling. It's the worst. 
I decided to go for the prune juice. It didn't take much. Half a glass and I felt a rumble. In I went. Determined to not leave until this thing was out. And surprisingly it slipped out with relative ease. It was finally lubed up enough. It came in two sections. I stood up. Turned around and looked at the troublemaker. It was like two Campbell's soup cans sitting in the toilet. I did what I'm sure most of you have done. Gave that turd the finger. 
It's such an amazing feeling. That empty feeling after feeling so full and plugged up. Almost as good as a rush.

I'm a seasoned user when it comes to pills. Old school 40/80s, then blues and opana. Using 14 years or so. Years ago I can say it was out of control. Last 3 years mostly blues, with some opana use. Last couple weeks things have slowed down supply wise, and haven't done anything since the 24th, until today. I did 100mg ABC Morphine, and 4 15mg roxies. However, I also got my first Sub today. 

I plan on taking the Sub either in the morning or later on in the day. Having no experience though I wanted to ask the community how I should dose..all 8mg at once, or maybe 2mg spaced out thru the day? Also, how long after the Sub will be safe to use again, as Wednesday my opanas will be back around, or at least more blues.

But since I am doing out patient detox I have to go cold turkey. Can't buy subs for the for the first 3 days like I usually do, and take bars to sleep.

I haven't slept in 2 days and am craving anything I can shoot, especially coke. I hope to God they allow me to get Shit prescribed by a doctor to help with everything. Lope helps the physical side effects, but those aren't too bad for me honestly. It doesn't help the cravings or anxiety like subs do.

I find these to be mostly auditory, but with some ""edge-movement"" that I notice. The sounds, well, sound like a radio is playing, and there is the sensation that I am rocking back and forth - as if I am in movement with the universe.

Like, I live in Vietnam and the supply chain is pretty clear cut.

From those areas (which also manufacture much of the meth in Asia, I understand) it makes its way from the countryside to all the big cities of Asia (and Australia).

Tar comes from Mexico, that's pretty clear cut how that works. But what about all these places on the East Coast? What about Chicago? Is all that dope Afghani? If so, then why is it different from the stuff in Europe, #3, where they have to use citric acid to break it down for shooting? 

Not to mention, why is there more heroin than ever before at the conclusion of a 10 year military occupation in Afghanistan? Is it tinfoil-hat-worthy to wonder if the CIA is somehow still involved in bringing it to the U.S. (like the olden days)?

He told me I looked up the wrong pill, turned out, I did misread the number on em, and when I looked up the correct number I got 15mg IR.

That whole incident got me thinking though, how possible is it to fake a pill? I know people have claimed to have gotten fake oxys before. Is this common...? I may be making it worse for myself in my head, but all of a sudden I'm feeling nauseous, and just not altogether pleasant. The amount I took is a fraction of my regular dose, just somethin to chill out on. But I don't know if I psyched myself out thinking it could be fake, or maybe I took some different chemical. 

Has that ever actually happened to anyone before? After this shit I'm never buying off someone unless I can verify the origin (a pharmacy) myself. I don't wanna die from poisoning from taking too high a dose of women's fertility medicine...

It's got the fun routine of chopping & snorting (kind of in the same way doing cocaine is fun, just because of that routine). I've been able to keep it down to once or twice every two weeks. But I think I'm in love. I'm not experiencing any immediate negative consequence. sWhat's the best way to file for divorce from this woman, before I'm in too deep?",1419973733.0
