Oh, and losing our very good jobs.. Can't forget that one. It's really depressing and I'm just wondering, has anyone else lost everything they worked for to this stupid fucking addiction?? 

Also, one more thing. I've NEVER seen anyone withdrawal like I do. And I smoke(loyal to the foil, always) but honestly, even people who have been using for so much longer than me. Everytime I'm sick as fuck and I go pick them up to go pick up a bag they're all dressed and ready for the day and able to walk down the street even though they say they're ""withdrawing soooo hard"" but me? I can't even out a pair of jeans on, hell, I can barely make it out of bed. But when I lay in bed all I feel like I can do is try to break my bones in half for them to be comfortable. (Harsh, I know, but if you WD like me, you should understand.) and my eyes fucking water like a fucking shower. Constantly. It literally doesn't stop.. I get chills, I throw up, it's AWFUL.

Then by night I feel like shit. Not as bad as like a day 2 or 3 but the shit sucks ass. I started feeling them a few months ago, like maybe 6, idk. Time slips away. I started using twice a day and everything was amazing. Then I'd start feeling like shit again before using. I now have gotten my tolerance down low but the daily withdrawal shit fucking sucks.

My current use would be like 6 10mg vicodins to get a good high. My top would be probably 10 10mg vicodins, a few oxy's or whatever I could find. Also fucked with tramadol for awhile but after you gain tolerance to it specifically, for me anyway, it sucks ass. 

Another random question, but does anyone else now hate the feeling of other drugs? I used to take a bit of everything randomly. Now everything but adderall sucks, and adderall is probably ok because I feel like a normal human being taking it. It also is the best for withdrawals Imo. Although I've heard some hate it.

I'm biting back all the things I need to say and saying nothing instead. I am a coward and I will never feel better. What the fuck is the point of getting closer to someone if they only die or fuck you over? I don't have the energy for any of this anymore. I feel like nothing is real and I'm a fucking joke to everyone I see. I am a joke to myself, not worth the time it takes to look at me or say my name. This town is empty and I am empty in it. There is no escaping this. 

Life is one big joke and I don't care enough to wait for the punchline. I know it will be lame and worthless and lacking entirely in wisdom and honestly, who even gives a shit? 

I can't even deal with myself. I don't want to go home to a house that feels like nothingness so I'm sitting next to a building downtown by myself at 3 in the morning. I was in the park at first but the fucking sprinkler system came on and now my back is soaking wet and I have a headache. This is fucking stupid, all I want to do is lean up against someone, have someone to sleep next to and tell me it's okay. It's not okay. I am so fucking NOT okay. 

And no one gives a fuck and I'm getting eaten alive by Mosquitos and humans and there's nothing left. The sound of laughter makes me feel like annihilating myself and everyone in sight. My life is a broken sewer line. My mind has too much in it and none of it makes any difference. I cannot live like this, I cannot live like this, I am so tired of the same old shit every day and I can't even write about it, there's nothing to make sentences with, the words don't go together and I can't spell the letters and I have nothing to say. 

There must be something more somewhere. I've tasted it, I've lived it, loved it, lost it.

Was addicted in high school to codeine, then quit when I graduated, and finally tried heroin a few months ago when I turned 30. I started out chipping, and just like everyone said, it has turned into almost every day. I'll go on 2-day binges of 0.1-0.2 g/day snorted (I know it's not a lot), then stop for a day. I've noticed the aches, yawns, and fatigue when I'm not using, but even not using three days, it's totally manageable.

The problem is the psycohlogical part. I haven't lost my job (but I've thrown up all day, which I think my boss might have noticed - especially given he has experience as a helper at a methadone clinic). I haven't lost any friendships. I don't feel like I'm physically addicted. So when that thought about ""it would be nice to use"" comes into my head, it's like I can't do anything about it, I just cop.

I don't want to go down this road, but it's hard for me to commit fully to a program like NA because I don't feel motivated enough (not enough fire). 

I'm consulting with a Suboxone-prescribing psychiatrist who will give me some potential avenues. Obviously not going to put me on Suboxone, but maybe he has other suggestions. But I'm wondering how you early chippers have been able to get free from the psychological bonds of heroin.

The funny thing is, I don't even find it that pleasurable anymore. It does indeed 'take away' all my problems, but I really don't get euphoria. It's the mental thought of snorting that line and the warmth that gets to me. It's almost like the thought of using is more euphoric than actually using.

Just sitting or standing and nodding out for an hour while you try to piss? I have discovered the best solution for urinary retention!
Basically you squat to pee. If you are a women you can put your feet on the toilet seat. (Edit: you can still have the weight on your butt, just put your knees up and heals on the edge of the toilet seat if you are worried about your balance, or breaking the toilet). If you are a man you can try it in the bathtub or outside. Just pop a squat and the pee will come. It works extremely well from my and my boyfriends (admittedly anecdotal) evidence.
Give it a whirl! I swear up and down it works for pee!
It also works for poop too, the picture I attached is for how it works in the bowel system. But it doesn't really work as well for that if you are super dope constipated.
Good luck and happy nods.

I'll put the TL;DR first: Are there any less obvious pros or cons to using this drug over oxy, other than price, if you enjoy both?

So I know tapentadol is not everyone's favorite drug on here, to say the least. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think people dislike it for two main reasons: 
1) The speediness of the drug has been known to make people feel jittery, anxious, sick, etc.
2) It's too weak for a lot of more experienced users to catch any type of buzz from it.
Despite all the negative feedback, I decided to give it a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I consider myself lucky that my tolerance was low enough to feel its effects, and I could really feel the 'warm blanket wrapped around you' feeling, especially in the stomach. 
So, my question is: if I am content with tapentadol, are there any advantages or disadvantages for using it instead of other opioids/opiates? I know the speedy effects of the drug make it a potential seizure risk like a stronger tramadol (without the serotonin part), but I also know it's cheaper than oxy, and my guess is its street price will keep dropping as much and more people realize they don't like it. Are there any less obvious pros or cons to using this drug over oxy, other than price, if you enjoy both? I'm talking ANYTHING, from a health perspective, addiction potential, or anything else you know about this drug that could be useful. For example, maybe tolerance skyrockets unusually fast with tapentadol relative to something like oxy.

It's pretty obvious I have more research to do, but I figured there may be some fellow tapentadol fans on here who are way more experienced and knowledgable than me on the subject, so I wanted to ask what you all thought.

Thanks in advance, and I apologize for the enormous wall of text! ",1424130457.0

I have been addicted to opiates since senior year of high school.. I'm now a junior in college. I have a cousin (who is basically like an older brother to me) who is also an addict and was taking them long before me and got me into them. He and I then sort of looked out for each other and helped each other find the next hit, although of course we were both selfish and in it for ourselves most of the time. Being older and more experienced, he had all the contacts, and so I mostly relied on him. He could be a hell of a manipulator and was known for using people; I'm not stupid, I know that he used me *a lot* but we both actually cared about each other. 

I went off to college and struggled with finding enough while I was away, so I ended up coming home most weekends to get more. It sucked. Now I can usually find opiates in my college town. This has caused my addiction to get worse and worse - I'm now snorting H and fent all the fucking time. I can feel myself slowly loosing control and it's scary as hell. My grades are getting worse, I feel like I'm loosing my friends because I never go out, I am in terrible shape physically, and I am struggling hard with depression and anxiety. I don't feel like I've hit rock bottom yet, but I'm worried it could be close.

It is only about 30% complete, but I am panicking at this point about interest as well as pretty much getting any kind of data to plot.. there are NO PUBLIC DATA SOURCES to track OD stats or heroin POTENCY in any kind of current context. I personally believe that this project, if it gets enough support and interest from users and possibly public services, could prevent and help create awareness of accidental overdose. 

The main information I want to gather is actual user-reported(anonymously of course) area and strength ratings of heroin they buy and also overdose reports by area. I have some functions completed to plot such data and also to draw zones related to this info that might predict distribution areas where you might run into types reported.. zones mix-in to each other and create danger area warnings and such shit as that... The android app would give alerts similar to weather apps if there is reporting trends that indicate that some shit you might buy is much stronger or more 'dangerous' or weaker or weird (like cut with some crap that gels in your rig).

It all seems like a good idea to me. and as a user myself I would find this useful. The problem is that I have no data sources, or really any idea if anyone would even give enough fucks to do something about these issues (using my project or not). I just want to push harm reduction, and really just help people who are going to do it anyways, including me, get high more efficiently and safely. I think we could all live better with that.

> Chemicals (opioids) interact with Receptors (protein molecules)

I am limiting this discussion to the μ-opioid receptor.

* Agonist - Chemical that activates the receptor
* Antagonist - Chemical that blocks receptor activation
* Partial Agonist - Chemical that activates the receptor, blocks excessive activation (ie: will have a ceiling affect)

> Affinity: an independent property of how well a chemical binds to a receptor

* Naltrexone - Antagonist with very strong affinity and no activation
* Bupenorphine - Partial Agonist with strong affinity, has some activation
* Morphine - Agonist with weak affinity plenty of activation

> Naltrexone is used to reverse the affects of an overdose because it is an opioid antagonist with the strongest affinity (that I can find data on)

To break the affect of (Suboxone) Bupenorphine, you must find an agonist with a stronger affinity.  Does one exist?  I don't know.",1424245243.0

And, before you rip my head off.. I did search and I read a couple threads about smoking ECP and some say you can some say you can't.  Honestly the girl that introduced me for the first time smoked ECP herself, but didn't really show me how.  

The handful of times I've done H, my usual routine is to smoke about 2/3 and snort 1/3 (except when I get tar, of course..)  But my question is specially, if you do smoke ECP, how many layers of foil do you guys usually use?

When I did it before I've always used 3-4 layers, but with tar I only needed 1 layer.  I just got some stamp bags and tried smoking it with 4 layers and I couldn't even get it to melt.  So I tried 1 layer and it vaporized instantly.  I think I got a good median with 2 layers of foil.  But just curious on your methods??  2 layers worked good but after I used the foil a few times the layers separated a bit and back to step 1 where it was hard to even get it to melt.  So I kept having to use a lighter to smash the layers together.  Using brand name Reyonalds Wrap because I had to buy some and I'm a baller like that, no off-brand shit.  ;P

As for snorting, well, once again, what's your guy's technique?  I've always snorted it literally as hard as possible but someone on IRC mentioned this may not be the best since it'll all go to your throat and thus basiclaly bypassing your sinus cavities.  And that you should snort just hard enough so that you don't have rocks falling out your nose.

Know anything about it? (More Q's below)","If this is tldr, feel free to skip down to my questions at the bottom.  But I do think the rest of the text provides some decent background for those questions...

So I've been getting BT heroin for a while now and almost always, the good quality stuff is a rock when room-temp or cold, but starts getting gooey when you warm it up a bit.  Sure it varies a bit, but generally speaking, that's how I've usually identified decent BTH and it hasn't steered me wrong.

I recently got some BTH from a new source and it was very... pastey and crumbly, no rock, no goo.  More like a crumbly kind of clay than the rock/goo I was used to.  The taste was harsh, it did have a TINY bit of that vinegary smell to it, but not much, and the taste was unique compared to what I am used to, kind of harsh and bitter, but not so bad it wasn't smokeable.  

I could NOT catch a buzz off it no matter how much I smoked.  Seemed to keep me well (my tolerance is low but I still hurt when I don't get a little something), but as far as getting high, *nada*.  Maybe it would be perfect for someone trying to quit or just wanting maintainence.  

Anyway, a month later, from yet **another** source I got the SAME stuff.  Same crumbly texture, same shitty taste.  I trust this source for the most part and said he had nothing to do with the other guy I got the same stuff from before.  This source also doesn't use and can't tell good from bad quality.  I don't want to go into any detail but he said he watched a guy in Mexico break it off a football sized brick, told him it was good shit, and the source swears he didn't cut it with anything.  To complicate matters, other people who have used this crumbly stuff say it's great (according to my source).  I suspect these people are first time H users who don't know shit.  For the record, I only smoke, and I have a generally low tolerance, I'm *usually* pretty good about keeping it in check.  

So my questions... 

* is there some shit ""tar"" going around mexico right now that isn't like REAL tar (that is, rocky/gooey but instead crumbly/clay-like)?  

* If you do know of this, is there anything you can say regarding how it's made differently?

* Is it truly shit, or is it actually good and theres just something weird about me, I'm a mutant so that I can't get off on it for the life of me?  

* Is it actually a common form of BTH that for some reason I never came across until recently?  

* does anyone have any experience with what I'm talking about? (Or have a friend who has experience, of course) and feel like sharing? (No, I am NOT interested in a source, just if you have had this same shit and what you thought of it).

* some of my source's customers who said it was good also smoke, but is it possible that it's in some form that makes it a shitty smoke but is still great for IVers?  Is that possible (with Tar, I mean, not getting into #3 or #4)

Just to be clear, I read the rules and the FAQ and I'm pretty sure this post is all good.  I am NOT asking for any kind of source nor am I even hinting at where/who my sources are.  I did mention a location... Mexico.  I hope that's vague enough to get a pass.  And all I'm asking for is advice and maybe knowledge from those with more experience.  If I did violate a rule, I have no problem with this post getting deleted immediately, I just hope some kind mod privately lets me know what I did wrong so I won't do it again.

Am I the Opiate Dragon King?,"I ask because I think I've got an *astronomical* tolerance, like into the stratosphere. Let me preface this by saying that I never got into this lifestyle by choice. I'm a pain management patient with around 7 compounding issues that just make me a **miserable human being**. Without these meds my life....well, I wouldn't have one. I'm not suicidal by any degree but the pain would have fucking driven me to it. (Lol to make it worse, it's back pain that's my main, MRI proven issue, and everyone on here, legit or not, just knows how the docs *loooove* that one.) I also didn't get to this astronomical amount over a couple of years either. My GP was pretty fucking useless (I loved him, he had the bedside manner of a saint, but his solution to absolutely *everything* was writing a script of narcs. This started me on Vics and Percs when I was barely in my mid-teens because of endo and knee pain(genetic skeletal fuck up). So, once my chronic pain hit in my early twenties, you can pretty much guess I was due for failure/addiction.

So. I'll start. Let's see if anyone can match or beat me, either personally or through secondhand/thirdhand/whatever experience. In order for me to be completely pain free and able to read/write/watch TV/draw (yes, this is what my life is reduced to, but my PM and healthcare bitching could be saved for another more appropriate sub) for around a couple hours and then nod off, I drop, *at once*....

600 fucking milligrams. Oral. Never touched  a needle not wielded by a doctor in my life. I don't drink. I don't live in a state where marijuana is legal for medical patients yet so I don't have that benefit, though I have tried it in the past and I know when it's the good medical shit, it *does* work, so there's that nail to just twist under my skin.

The only caveat to this GIGANTIC habit is that, for some reason, if I'm not pushing myself (i.e doing ""not doing normal people things""), this lasts me all day, like 18-24 hrs straight, even longer before I start feeling actual withdrawal symptoms (the chronic pain comes back way before the cold sweats and nausea do). I'll usually sleep a nice 8-9 hour sleep, shorter if I haven't had a 9-10 day on the pain scale, wake up and finish off my day on the internet or writing or, very rarely, trying to reclaim some of my artistic pursuits.

So, what do you fellow opiate dependents think? Am I the statistical nightmare? Are there actually people out there worse than I am? It won't make me feel any better in the sense that ""haha, you're worse off"". I wouldn't wish this addiction on anybody. Just feel better in that I'm not some freak that's slipped through the medical system's cracks until I'm beyond repair. Part of this is a genetic tolerance to opiates and downers in general too. (People sure seem to love their Valium, I can pop 8 and not feel *shit*. I don't do them regularly either, no tolerance, no build up, my body just thinks I've swallowed skittles or something.)

The worst part of all of this? I never *knowingly* chased the dragon. I feel the dragon chased me, and fucking swallowed me whole. Then crowned me his king, while he blows his blue smoke in my face.

If you had whatever you use in your hand, your normal fix, and you knew if you took it, you would die, would you? Your options in this scenario are, take whatever it is you normally take and die, or walk away forever. Does your answer change if you are just about to withdraw? If you are 12 hrs into withdrawing?

Just some food for thought as the title says. Came to my mind for a couple reasons I don't feel like getting into right at this moment, and I thought about how if I was presented with that exact situation, what would I do? The kicker is walking away forever, cuz anyone could say no to one time if it meant you stayed alive, but knowing you could *never* touch opiates again for the rest of your life?

Because of this, I decided to limit my mode of communication to head nods for the next few minutes for fear of having my voice crack if I said anything aloud. If I was going to get out of this whole ordeal unharmed, I would have to appear at least somewhat tough, in Skeet’s mind. Or, I'd need to otherwise placate this dangerous individual.

Now, let’s just take a step back and rehash this situation we have here. It surely wasn't at the time, but it’s almost comical to me now the scene that unfolded as I sat there. It’s more from a detached sense of wonderment that I even look back on this whole ordeal. It took a year passing for me to even really reflect on what happened without having a small panic attack while thinking about it.

So there I sit. Frozen. Eyes wide. Skeet on the left; the stolen backpack on the right. Both entities blissfully unaware of each other. Initially, I was so stunned and panicked because I had assumed that Skeet had seen me leave the hotel with his bag in hand. But, miraculously, that didn't seem to be the case.

My overt panic symptoms start to subside slowly under the thought that there’s a small chance that I may not get my ass beat to a pulp after all.

But it still didn't help that Skeet, the guy who I just learned robs and beats the shit out of people for a living, was sitting a mere inches away from his own stolen backpack. There was dynamite and fire in my midst. I was going to have to orchestrate some sort of beautiful ballet in order to prevent the two from mixing. As you can probably imagine, I was on edge, my feelings reflected the situation--and you could almost taste the tension.

I could see his mouth moving but I couldn't hear anything. After a few moments of watching his teeth go up and down, I finally was able to comprehend the audible words.

“YO! Fool, are you fucking deaf?! I said, let me borrow ya phone!” Skeet’s voice came back loud and clear. I kind of shook my head to snap out of my panic little more, now realizing he with 100% surety that he still wasn't aware that I just jacked him.

I didn't say anything, but I naturally looked down at my ash tray, where my newish iphone was propped out of. That ash-tray always fit that phone perfectly as a makeshift holder. 

He saw my glance and immediately snatched it up quickly, without saying a word.

I could hear the phone start to ring on the other side as he leans my direction to speak again, “My phone ran out of batteries and I just need to call my boy Trev. Where you go anyway? Thought you was going to the bathroom.” He turned his attention back to my phone, as Trev answered.

“Yo, Trev, I’m in front of the Henry in a small blue truck, hurry up.” Skeet then put the phone down—but in his own lap. I noticed this, but didn't say anything.

After a while of waiting, Skeet’s friend “Trev” showed up. He was a smaller kid, white, early twenties, light brown hair, pretty average and unremarkable. He actually looked kind of timid, it may have just been Skeet’s presence, but it didn't help that he had bad posture and wore a t-shirt that was a couple sizes too big for him.

Skeet tells Trev to hop in. 

“Hey Skeet,” I start, “You know, I really gotta get back to my house. I’m meeting up with someone and I’m already late,” I lied.

“You’ll be home soon mang,” Skeet replied, “This won’t take very long. We just need a ride over to the Plaza.” Skeet kept tapping in fingers on his right knee as he sat next to me in the front seat. 

“Alright well can I get my phone back though, I need to make a call,” I lied again.

“I’m almost done with it,” which was Skeet’s way of saying, “No, you can’t have your phone back.”

I was trying to act oblivious to the situation unfolding, but I knew the ordeal was getting serious.

I was starting to get pretty nervous about the phone in particular. I would never had let him use it, on my own. I surely would have lied and said I didn't have it with me or something. Around that time in my life, that phone was like my only lifeline to the outside world. It had all my contacts, so it was the only way I could get a hold of my main connections. Also, I relied heavily upon that phone to get public transit times when I wasn't in my truck, which was a lot. And lastly, the phone doubled as my laptop. I needed it so search for jobs (now that I was recently unemployed) and to send out resumes. 

Not only for these reasons, but if something were to happen to that phone, I’d have no way of replacing it. If I remember correctly it was an iphone 4s, which was the newest model at the time. And with rent coming due, there was no way I could replace it with something of equal caliber.

I told Trev that the back passenger side seat belt was broken, so he would have to sit behind me, on the driver side. I couldn't risk him moving around Skeet’s backpack on that side and Skeet catching a glimpse of it. The mere thought of that happening made me shudder

I step out of the truck to fold forward my driver’s side seat and let Trev in the back, it was a two-door four-seat truck, with two fold down seats in the back. Skeet was still sitting in the passenger side front seat. And after a second or two of directions from him. We were on our way to the Plaza.

Skeet was mostly just being lazy because it really wasn’t that far, it probably would have been even quicker to walk. After a few minutes of driving, we are in a parking lot area behind the plaza and Skeet directs me exactly where to park, pointing towards a group of people sitting around in the back right corner. 

I put the truck in park, but left the engine running. I didn't want Skeet to get the idea that I was staying long. I roll up both front windows as Skeet opens the front side door and gets out of the truck. I couldn't help but notice that that he still had my phone in his hand. 

My backseat area is pretty small, so Trev maneuvers himself into the now vacant front passenger seat to sit while we wait. Skeet was still trying to get a hold of someone on my phone. Pacing back and forth to the side of the car, in front of the group of people we parked by. These were people that Skeet was apparently acquainted with. Skeet told me that as soon as he got a hold of his ‘homie’, he’d be done, and I could be on my way.

Trev politely tries to make small talk with. I try to make it obvious that I’m not in the mood. By this time, I was getting really nervous again.

I sit there waiting impatiently as Trev continues to gush to my right ear about how ‘fire’ the dope he’s been getting recently. I laugh casually to myself because, if you remember, this was supposed to be Skeet’s ‘main guy.’ It was clear that Trev was no more than a lowly middleman, if that.

Skeet comes up to the passenger side window and motions for me to roll it down. Before he can even say anything, I cut in, “Skeet I need to leave now, you need to give me my phone back, and, Trev, you need to hop out.”

Trev starts to whine something or other about how he thought maybe I could give him a ride to the Sunset district when a ominous smile creeps across Skeet's face. My gaze never left Skeet’s face; I knew he was up to something and I assumed that I was about to find out.

“Ya, about that...” Skeet started, “Ima gonna need about $100 if you gonna be wantin’ ya phone back.” 

Trev immediately stops his whining as he turns his head to get a look at Skeet, trying to gauge what was going on. A thick, dead silence hangs desperately in the humid air of the truck.

“Skeet come on man, I’ve given you rides, food, and free dope all day man.” I plead.

“No worries brudda,” Skeet smiles casually to himself, “I've been wantin’ me a new iphone anyway.”

“Skeet, not cool man, just give him his phone back. We need it to call my connect anyway,” Trev protests in my defense.

“He can get his phone back if he wants... for $100.” Skeets replies to Trev, with a high-pitched, mocking tone.

At this point, I’m nearly fucking boiling, “You are a fucking piece of shit scumbag. You know that?” I ask Skeet as I reach in to my pocket for my wallet.” I knew I had enough and I wanted nothing more than for this day to be over.

“It is what it isn't---wait, it ain't what it is? No, it is---ahhh fuck it, however that goes. Homie, we all gotta make money some how,” He said quickly. Skeet meant to say “it is what it is,” but the fool was so god damn stupid he couldn't even get that right. Not to say “it is what it is,” is some sort of brilliant defense anyhow.

Skeet brushed off some lint on his shoulder and continued, “And just so you don’t think to do anything stupid,” He gestures towards to group of people behind him, “All these fools back here got my back.”

I honestly don’t remember being too scared, so I don’t recall if I was shaking from fear or anger. I rest my arms on my lap to steady them. Slowly but steadily, I split my wallet and look to see what I have inside: $160. 

“I only have $80 left, is that gonna be enough?” I ask Skeet. There goes the junkie inside of me again, always trying to cut corners to make an extra buck or two.

“Yea that should do it. Now hand it over,” Skeet says firmly.

I hand skeet the cash and present my open palm for the phone. Skeet simply counts the money and reaches for his wallet.

“Dude, Skeet, give him the phone, ya’ll made a deal.” Trev says, naively. I still wasn’t sure about Trev, but he sure seemed to be genuinely on my side, and I was happy for any help I could get at that point.

Growing more furious by the second, I ask Skeet if he is going to give me back the phone.

“The money is only half of what I want, I want the rest of the dope you got from Jock.” Said Skeet, counting through the money again before carefully placing the bills in the billfold.

This motherfucker! I think to myself. Take my money, take my phone, hell!, take the clothes off my back; but never, never steal my mental fortitude, my anxiety blanket, my depression prevention, my medicine; in other words, don’t steal my dope!

My whole body is pretty much shaking uncontrollably as I sat there and did the mental math, weighing my options. I think to myself:

Fight?

Forget the phone?

Fork over the dope?

Trev was another curve ball I wasn't sure about, was he going to get out of my car willingly? Or would he prove to be trouble as well? Up until that point, Trev was mainly trying to convince Skeet to give me back my phone, which was a good sign but I didn't know for sure.

I think it over. The value of the phone vs. that of the dope I had left. Also, I have to consider the fact that he might even try to shake me down more, even if I give him the rest of my black.

“Once I give you the black, how do I even know you’ll give me the phone back?” I ask Skeet. 

I could almost see the cogs turning in Skeet's head. Apparently, this wasn't a question that I was supposed to ask because he didn't have an answer ready and seemed offended by the question.

“Are you...are you, you calling me a liar, bruh?” Skeet responded with his head tilted to the side.

I roll my eyes.

I knew I didn't have much of a choice. Like I mentioned early, that phone was my lifeline and I undoubtedly needed it. I was just going to have to take the loss and hope Skeet gives me my phone back just to get rid of me.

“Fine, just give me a fucking second.” I say as I reach in to my center console and grab my kit. I had bought an 8-ball off Jock earlier, and the only bit that was gone was from what Skeet and I did earlier minus the small bag I got for Brian. So, there was still at least 2.5 grams left of $100+/gram stuff. 

But before I hand the shit over to Skeet I made sure to covertly fingernail a piece off in case I couldn't get any more dope that day. Either way, I was going to need something to relax after this, surely.

I hand the dope over to Skeet, as Trev looks on, wide-eyed.

All in all, skeet now had me for close to $400. And the second after I dropped that chunk of black into Skeet’s hand, by the look on his face, I knew he was going to try for more.

In prevention, I say, “Skeet, I don’t have anything else, no cash, no money. Just give me my phone...please!” I plead with Skeet.

“Come on man, he paid up, now do good on it,” Trev echoed.

I decided right then and there, that there was no possible outcome where Skeet was getting anything else from me. I was going to go home in a body bag before Skeet procured another dollar of value from me. However, I decided to be sly about it, rather than ostentatious.

The scenario was such as this: 
Skeet had his forearms rested on the door where the window was rolled down, leaning slightly into the car, over Trevor. Skeet’s arms were crossed, so my iphone was in his left hand, but on his right side.

I begin the act, “Skeet, listen man,” I say, seemingly leveling with him, “I've had a pretty bad day already, and just look what I've been dealing with…” At the same time, I lean over the center console with my right arm extended towards Skeet, right in front of Trev.

“Look,” I say, “do you see it?” I twist my arm over and give skeet a good view of my wrist, right in front of his face. Skeet’s eyes narrowed to get a good look at what I was trying to show him.

My eye’s were staring wide and intently, as if to say, “Go on, look for yourself…”

At that very same moment, with my eyes still on my right wrist, my left arms snaps out of hiding, like a snake on its prey, and snatches the iphone out of Skeet’s hand. Before Skeet could even realize what had happened, I was back sitting upright in my seat, holding my iphone. 

All the pent up frustration from thus far in the day was released out of me in one fell swoop, in the form of words, in a stream of verbally abusive firepower. Every racist, offensive, mean, vulgar sentence that came to mind I said to Skeet in those next few moments.

Skeet didn't do anything but kind of stand there stunned. He said something to the tune of, “Ya well I still got your money and dope bro.” But given the fact that Skeet probably never intended on giving back my phone, it still felt pretty sweet.

I roll up my window, and floor it out of there.

I was almost to the edge of the parking lot when I slammed on my brakes. Tires screeching, I reversed back until Skeet came into view through the passenger side window.

Without saying a word, I reach back and grab the backpack behind Trev and show it to Skeet, dancing it next to my face, smiling out of the corner of my mouth.

The feeling of satisfaction I got from watching Skeet's facial expression go from confusion to dread  was almost worth the $400. I will never forget that moment.

As I high-tail it out of there, I realize I still have one more person to deal with.

How to play my cards...,"So a guy I get my pills from reccomended a quack doctor that he sees to go to and get some decent scripts. My guy gets lortab 10, opana 20, adderal 10, xanax 1mg and a few others than I don't care about because I don't buy them. My guy tells me that I have to be careful and ""slow play"" the doctor.  He tells me to go in the first few times and just let him get to know me a little better and then drop the bomb on the 3rd or 4th visit with him that I have back pain from a previous injury and I used to get lortab 10 but wasn't working so well even then.  

My question is what should I say is wrong on NY first appointment, and how exactly to go about dropping the bomb on the 3rd or 4th appointment and actually get my script. His officw is super sketchy, it took me all of last week just to get an apoijntneny , they do a pretty screening and ask why you're coming in, I said back pain and anxiety and add, all in 3 separate phone calls and he isn't accepting new patients for any of those so finally I just said I need a new family doctor and they still pried and pried but I stuck with my guns and got the appointment anyway for the end of March.  Lastly should I quit smoking and doing pills now in case he drug tests me the firat visit?  My guy can't smoke because the Dr almost fired him for failing one test for weed.  Would he even test me the first few visits since I definitly won't get a script (not even gonna bring it up till 3rd or 4th appointment).  Anything else I should know about or be ready for?

Complete noob to going to drs for my script I've always bought from the streets but it's getting expensive.  NO I'm not gonna switch to H so save the schpil. ",1424209971.0

God works in mysterious ways I tell ya!

How is sub withdrawal? Can I expect significant wd's on taking them for 2 weeks? As of now I am going to be taking 1/4th - 1/2 daily of the 8/2's.

Hey all. So quick background- 

-addicted to heroin for the past three years, 
-graduated college, which is where the seeds of my acciction***s***  were planted & nurtured 
-move back in with parents at home, track down a hook, become careless with my use
-found a job after months of searching, but get caught nodding on the job and am given a stern warning

-fearing for my job security, I ask my dealer for some meth and he is more than happy to oblige
-meth keeps me awake & alert no matter how much heroin I've done 
-friends & family strongly against my opiate use cannot distinguish speedballing me from sober me, but the second I hit some heroin without chasing it with some ice, i get fucked. 

Soon enough, I found myself hitting meth a few days in a row, days turned to weeks, and now Im a solid two consecutive months into daily meth use. I eat, sleep, and function normally, whic indicates that my tolerance has skyrocketed. I've tried stopping several times, but it's extremely difficult to control.  There's no magical solution like Bupe for something like meth, so I'm fucking scared. 


So, r/opiates, does anyone have a similar story, juggling two addictions? And what in the fucking world did you do to overcome one or the other?? I'm legitimately worried and could use all the advice anyone has to offer. hanks

Back to the doctor today for my potentially fatal medical condition. Good news: my condition is still not of fatal severity yet (score!) and got chatted up by the cute young female doctor (I'm a straight, attractive, professional chick--my girl-crush on my doc is a separate life crisis for another thread haha). We talk about random stuff, then discuss my pain. She has the most sympathetic, understanding, active-listening face on as I describe my symptoms. I throw in the tag line, ""but I've been trying to bear thru the pain bc I don't want to become some kind of junkie."" She chuckles and goes, ""well you have legit pain, and people with legit pain can't get hooked bc it doesn't get you high."" It was adorable, and the naivety with which she said it made her even more adorable. Then, she says the magic words: we can put you on OxyContin for long lasting pain and Oxycodone for intermittent pain. I think of dead puppies to try to keep myself from smiling. I (admittedly sadly, since I know it'll be a while till I see her again) say goodbye and she sends the senior doc in for a little FaceTime (the kind they charge health insurance for, not the iPhone app). Senior doctor politely and professionally informs me that the only change to my meds will be allowing me to take them more frequently--same meds, just every 4 hours instead of 6.

Well, fuck. Can we just go with what the hot, fresh-outta-med-school doc that confused me about my sexual orientation said?!

Places I've been

Of things I've deserted

Of pieces I've lost and abandoned

Six years of mistakes 

That still flow through my veins

Are there some simple ways to test whether or not I have a real A-215? The color/size looks normal (light blue on the inside and outside). The ""A 215"" imprints look legitimate, based on pictures of the real pill. Nothing sketchy looking about the outside.

I took a small amount (maybe 3mg) and dropped it into a glass of water to see how long it took to dissolve, because I read that fakes will dissolve very quickly. It took about 5-7 minutes for it to fully dissolve. Is that a sign of a real pill?

I also read that real pills will taste bitter where fakes will taste more chalky. I haven't tasted yet since the pill is cut into quarters, but I could try that as well.

Heres the thing,  I've done oxies quite a few times, morphine once and dillies once (all oral except dillies which I snorted).  

Anyways my chipping experiences goes like this, 25-45MG of oxy got me high for a few hours but nothing to intense, 100MG morphine took forever to hit but got me pretty blasted compared to the oxy, and 5mg of dillies snorted just barely got me opiated.

I should mention that between my use there is a minimum 1 month break (often longer) so its not like I have a crazy tolly or anything, though I have a hunch I naturally have a big opiate tolly since I've never felt nauseous or anything from them and the first time I did oxy ever I did 30mg (but i didnt even nod).

Anyways what I'm getting at is PST made from 1.5LBs of seeds costs about $15 and gets me opiated for 12 hrs.  Furthermore, it gets me more blasted than oxy or morphine (though it feels really similar to morphine, which makes sense).

Here where I am oxy costs close to $1 a mg and I get high for 2, maybe 3 hrs.

probably should have only done one extra not three. don't worry though, you can still make it work you've got enough. then something happens and it never fails something stressful or aggravating or even just a good day that you want to enjoy a little more. last night I stayed up a little later than I should have and ended up getting into the bag of pills again because I couldn't sleep. it's 230am technically Wednesday morning. that means only two days til payday you'll be able to figure something out go ahead and do that last one.

My main connect, to the good, consistent dope, got cut off because of a disagreement with his supplier. Bummer b/c That leaves me with a couple numbers for dudes that I've only copped from once. Not good options. They tend to have weak/small bags. 

My only other option is to go through a middle man to get the same good bags as my main guy or his second string guy who has pretty good dope. standard, but fair middle man tax applies. 

So I've been calling/texting my middle for a couple days. No response, very odd. He is usually on point since that is his only hustle and the way he stays well/high. I check the local mugshots website and lo and behold, my middle man is right there amongst the new arrests. 

He has a bond set, and it's very low, but I guess his family isn't helping him with it because he is still in there. Poor guy must be feeling awful by now, it's been two days so I know he is hurting. I toy with the idea of posting bond for him, but I don't know him well enough to trust that he will make his court sppearance. I was about to do it, but my fiancee decided it was best not to, as we can't afford to lose that money. It still bothers me since his bond is low and I hate to think about him being sickin jail.  

So, with all good options being dead in the water i decide to drive by the dope spot just to see if i can get lucky. I expect to come away empty handed. Turns out my main guy is back selling the good bags and he was out there. I went ahead and grabbed some and now I guess i can cop from him again. 
So it turned into a good day even though I feel for my guy. Kind of bitter sweet I guess.

Blue Stamp Passion with Kiss Lips 8/10

Blue Stamp Fire with log on fire 8/10

Blue Stamp Killer with bleeding knife 8/10

Red Stamp Sugar Hill with hard to make out design 8/10

Solid Red Bag no stamp 3/10. Garbage. Avoid at all costs.

Brown Stamp Income Tax 4/10. Garbage. Some BS cut that turns dirt brown. Avoid at all costs.

Green Stamp El Chappo with pic of Chappo 6/10

Black Printed (not stamp) Avatar 7/10 maybe 6/10.

Baby blue bags no stamp. 7/10. Produces weird tunnel hearing side effect. Have experienced this with other bags in past. Not sure what the deal is there but it was decent stuff.


All bags were standard burg size roughly .025 - .04 each on the scale for anywhere from $60-$80 a bun or $260-$320 a brick. Prices flux depending on who you are getting from. 


The Passion, Fire, Killer and Sugar Hill all mix the same look the same taste the same.. Not sure if it really is the same tho. 


So there you have it from the burgh. No lack of bags here thats for sure.

So I used to have the terrible habbit of shooting up as I was behind the wheel.  I know how stupid that is but I honestly never had any problems with it.  But one day after picking up and on my way back home I wasnt driving.  My buddy was in the drivers seat and he wanted to fix, so I prepped his shot and administered it to him as he was driving.  Next thing I know the car is veering over in traffic on the highway and hits the adjacent truck.  Immediatly I grab the wheel with my right hand and some how manage to get my left hand on the gas peddle.  So i'm steering and hitting the gas/breaks from the passanger seat.   Someone was looking out for me that night because I got us off the next exit about 2 miles down the road and was able to turn into a side street off the freeway.  And even more supprising the car we hit for some reason didnt follow us off the highway.  My buddy came to after a few miniutes and we safely made it home.    ",1424429127.0
2wj9xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2wj9xq/seriously_fuck_bitches/,14,https://redd.it/2wj9xq,junkiebopeep,"Seriously, fuck bitches","I just got to my latest treatment center on Tuesday because I live at rehab these days (FML), and I walked out of another treatment center on Sunday. It seemed pretty cool when I got here: they let you work, and they let you go out, and they don't have any groups. Actually, the no groups thing is pretty weird, but I've been living in treatment for three months and really need to find a job so I don't have to do this forever, so maybe that will help me get on my feet and get out of this funk of being institutionalized. Plus this place literally only has four rules: don't get high, don't bring sex partners home, don't scream on the phone at night, and don't eat on the couch. 

Anyway, it's a really small place and there are only three other people here. I've been getting really weird vibes from two of the young girls here - like, I feel like they don't like me for some reason, but I chalked that up to the fact that I'm on a sub taper and I haven't been very sociable. I honestly spend most of the time on my phone: either browsing the internet, texting, or talking.

But when I do try to reach out to these girls, they're super aloof and respond with one word answers. Like, really make it clear that they don't want to talk to me. They're like, young rich girls - maybe they're just stuck up. 

So I went to bed tonight, and I'm laying in bed quietly browsing Facebook for awhile, and then I grab my headphones to listen to ""This American Life"" without disturbing my roommate. I couldn't sleep, so I'd gotten up quite a few times to pee, get water, whatever. All of a sudden my roommate gets up and storms out of the room. Next thing I know, the clinical director is in the room, telling me she's taking my phone because I'm making too much noise on it, and keeping my roommate up. What?

So apparently this bitch went down to complain about me. One, the only noise I was making was tossing and turning because I couldn't sleep, and getting up to pee a bunch of times. So I went downstairs to smoke and this girl gives me a death look when I come outside.

I say, ""You know, you could have told me that I was bothering you.""

She says nothing.

Anyway, I really liked this place when I got here, and I really don't want it to turn into a hostile environment. I don't get why these girls don't like me, but they make it obvious that they don't. It makes me feel shitty because other women have always hated me.

Anyway, fuck bitches. I just need to stay here long enough to get a job and then hopefully I can move the fuck out of rehab. Oh, and not relapse, because I never want to go to treatment again and my relapses are the main reason I keep having to go back to start. Being institutionalized is a bitch. 

TL;DR: I hate other women and the ones I live with now are the worst I've met since I came to Cali.",1424428001.0

I try to go back to sleep, but the queue of thoughts can't stop in days like these.


""Great, the sweats."" I take my clothes off, as I am lying on bed. I toss them to the ground. I see my foil riddled desk, the floor decorated with dirty clothes and empty Sour Patch Kids Watermelon bags, and those dull razors and sliced straws and loose popcorns here and there. A pulse of pain jerks my muscles. And my stomach just broke up with me. And the ironic boner is here to stay. 


""Shit. I don't have money. Good thing I won't be hungry for a while. Now, if I can only reach that aleve. Fuck it, I am going to bed."" Then the dreams between consciousness begin. Those wonderful dreams storm on my head. One where I am eating scorpions, and one with a gif of my dad disapproval. One where my little brother looks down on me. And ones where animals from owls to lions shake their head and leave my company.
I wake up weeping and tossing and turning. The emotional pain is the worst. It feels like your mother is disownening you, your ex dumping you, and your best friend betraying you. At the same moment. Along with the feeling that an old you has terminated.
You start thinking of your petty sour patch kids thifts, your lies to everyone, and your throwups in public. Oh and the time you were obviously incapacitated to write the check for your rent, so the lady says, ""You know, let me do that for you,"" as your nodding looks like  agreeing. Pitiful. Fun, but pitiful. 
Your clearest thoughts are, ""This will be over in 5 days."" and, ""I can make it to the dull razor if I try really hard.""


Days pass. You make it to the razor. You start slashing when you are conscious enough to do so. But it's too dull. But the pain replaces the permanently lost endorphins. And you kind of like that. And what else are you going to do. No money, no friends, and you've caused mayhem on whatsapp. Not even food. But fuck food anyway. So you keep slashing until you start seeing slivers of gooey, tar ridden red on your wrist. And you just hope that does the trick. Back to sleep, you think. It's all the same now. And if I'm still alive, the razor is right next to the pillow. You wish you had a gun.


Once the physical part of the withdrawal is over, suicide really takes a swing on you. You just want your life to be over, because all of your insecurities and underlying mental illness is amplified without an opiate to numb them in. You reason, ""Pain will remedy pain."" And you start thinking about getting a gun. But you're broke, so a dull razor next to your pillow will do. 
The funny thing is, heroin hasn't stabbed your veins yet.

 
Needles are, of course, a superset of this hell: They work better, they damage you more, but your account lasts longer to support this habit.

 
Baking powder, ice cold water, spoon, half a gram of tar. Stir thoroughly. Cotton ball. Suck. Look for a functioning vein. Alcohol swab. Push the air out. Gaze at her golden body. Tap the vein. Pull. Push. Spliff. And dance with the best love you've felt in your life. Twice. Three times.


Benadryl. Dxm. Tonic water. Grapefruit juice. Tweak your chemistry. Stabilize your tolerance. Treat yourself with the occasional speedball. Rinse. Repeat. How the fuck have you finished a gram of valium and 200mg of xanax in less than a month. And where did you find somas. Don't forget, try to save money for a gun. 


Alcohol swab packaging, your roommate's q-tips, and orange caps grow on top of the lined foil and your candy bags. The walls are higher now. The friends are fewer. And the throwups are frequent. Abrupt too.  Brown vomit settling on the sink for weeks. And yeah, you shat the bed. The only people you speak with are other junkies. And the conversations are either about scoring or getting money they owe you back so you can get higher.

 
Fuck work. Fuck school. Fuck you. You stop coding when you're off your mind; heroin's creative delusions died with your purer soul. Your energy levels dwindle. And depression doesn't depress you anymore because you know you deserve to die soon. Be it with a needle or a dull razor next to your pillow. Because who are you kidding, you can't save up for a gun.


Pull. Push. Spliff. Dance. Forget.

 
Green puss from her tit. Another getting fucked in the bathroom. The dealer reaks from embalming fluid. And one of the gay clingers is offering his cock. The room smells like dog shit fused with puke, vinegar, and diarrhea. Those were the roots of the ride. Those were the days when smack didn't hurt. Those were the days of opiate innocence when you pay for a half and fuck up smoking the quarter you actually end up with. Those were the days when you glimpsed at how some strippers end up. 


Those were good days compared to the ones have ahead. 


I will be lying if I said heroin is completely terrible. It's fucking great, actually. Best antidepressant out there. I didn't only lose good parts of my soul, I also lost bad ones: after heroin's hell, I've become generally more relaxed and more capable of dealing with depression and mania. I know I don't have the capacity to use it wisely - - very few do. But if you can, heroin actually can be good for you. But don't, because you'll probably be looking for a dull razor next to your pillow. Those razors hurt. 

I've been clean for about a week.

I went to a psych ER today to make sure I am not poisoning myself with Lithium. I am not! But I need a steady pdoc to continue it. The pdoc at the ER today was probably the most honest doctor I've ever met. It supports my theory that doctors are very familiar with opiates. If you know what I mean. She told me my chronic, bipolar suicidal tendencies will not go away with a pill, therapy, or heroin. I need to force myself to re-enjoy what I used to think is meaningful in life. You know, survive. For me that's my family and writing. My family is far away, but keyboard, you are here! 

Anyway, I am drunk.

So this suicide thing (I am perfectly safe from that state of mind right now). How do you interpret it? Why are you still here?

After fucking up hardcore some years ago I had to cut myself off from all connects for anything opiate.  Fast forward to about a month and a half ago when I actually became closer to this guy and have gotten some dones from him here and there. 

For the context of the story I had owed him 20 bucks for fronting me some stuff (which is an amazing thing since we hadn't known each other that well yet) and I needed some more since I am trying to party it up before I go to prison in two weeks.  Since I had mentioned it in why I needed to get fucked up like hell he brought me a rig and 4 10mg dones for 55 since I owed him and paid for some gas too.  

I invited him up to my place for a few shots of whiskey and to hang out for a few.  He then proceeded to mention that we should go to the local strip joint but I had no money left.  

Now this is where I would have expected the night to be a few more drinks and then part ways.  

Wrong. 

First he just offers to pay cover so we can go watch some dancing and have a good time.  Once we arrive it turns into jack'n'cokes for each, then a beer each.  Welp that wasn't even enough for him to be satisfied with showing me a good time.  He bought me a lap dance from IMO the hottest girl there.  

He ended up spending all the money I gave him for what I owed, what I bought and the gas money just to show me a good ass time before gettin stuck with a bunch of dudes for a couple years.

i followed her into the city and she warned me We have to hang out.  i dont like these dealers.  just take the cash and i go.  but i was assured this was pure as fuck so i walked up the stairs to the victorian suite.  the man who opened the door was built like a linebacker but he wore a shimmery blue/silver cocktail dress.  i barely noticed that because he pointed a gun at my face as Tears For Fears blared behind him.  inside people were screaming THERE'S A ROOM WHERE THE LIGHT WON'T FIND YOU! -but he knew jessica and smiled and we went in...

Mr. Maru looked like an Asian vampire and would push a button on songs he liked and start to sing them aloud karaoke style.  i was gone and this old woman with a hole in her throat pressed a cup in my hand which i drank out of and gagged.

that will WAKE you up child, she smiled as she went back to the kitchen where Mr. Maru was singing Buddy Holly songs.  when the walls started breathing and Aztec hieroglyphics bulged out of the floor i figured someone dosed me.  the lsd and heroin shot were a trip.  a naked woman picked up the bag of dope i dropped and put it back in my jacket as lobsters swam out of the TV.  i couldn't move for hours and was a prisoner to these visions.

later, arm in arm and leaning on each other we staggered back into the dorms.  it was so normal here.  the Red Hot Chili Peppers were blasting to drunken college kids as jessica opened up her umbrella inside and we stared at the elevator panel without comprehension. ",1424401753.0

Basically I've been smoking some pretty fire black tar heroin for a few months and recently instead of getting tar I got ecp/powder instead. Strange right? West coast is primarily known for it's tar and I was used to #4 ecp in Maryland when I used to live there. Very good stuff, definitely more easy to function doing tasks n shit. So I mainly have more experience with the ecp than the tar, however I like them both uniquely and don't rate one higher than the other. Just apples and oranges.

Since our dope comes from Mexico, he told me they've started to make ""china white"" out of the black tar heroin. The tar is pretty fire (It's not gooey at room temp, leaves little residue on foil when smoked, good high) 

Now I never heard about this and I did some googling and found zero results about converting bth --> ecp # 

Now I'm very confused on this... I just snorted a 30-50mg line and I'm feeling very very nice. Got a good nod going on right now... and feels a bit similar to the tar I've been smoking these past few months... It looks beige/tanish....and I won't post pics but here is the closest thing I could find that what it looks like http://imgick.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/olmsted/photo/13355274-mmmain.jpeg

It isn't rocky at all, and there are some clumps sorta although not necessarily sticky. Just some clumpy balls in the g I picked up that break apart easily with little pressure. 

When I snort it and make lines, since it isn't rocky in texture it will leave a bit of a streak/residue on the glass table I snort off of... 

Like the #4 east coast powder in Maryland was had a harder texture, while this stuff has a softer texture. This ""china white"" is almost like clay, and the drip is a bit strange. It doesn't have a slight vinegary burn but more of a clay/dirt feeling drip lol if that makes sense.

Is it possible to convert black tar heroin into a ecp-like powder? (NOT GUNPOWDER) My guy claims this is extremely good shit... and it does feel like it however it doesn't feel like the heroin I had in Maryland. Personally I like both tar and ecp for different reasons. I like that ecp is usually more euphoric/energetic while the tar is more noddy/dreamy.. 

I'm not talking about gunpowder heroin btw, not black tar heroin blended with b12 or some shit.... just wondering if this possible. I don't know if it contains fentany or some fentanyl analogue... but the high lasts 2 hours at least... I dissolved like 2-5mg in a cap of a water bottle to see what would happen and it dissolved fine.

Currently, I'm just feelin very noddy/dreamy with and euphoric right now... I don't want to do anything but just lie down and chill lol...  but is this coming directly from and synthesized the black tar heroin I've been smoking?

Judges do not look kindly upon the former.


Hello all, please weigh in on this issue. Science backed responses appreciated. I apologize in advance for the wall of text. 

I have a pouch that I use to carry my prescriptions and OC medications that I have used for years. Typically I store a day or two worth of:

**Percocet 10mg (capsules or tablets)**
* Wellbutrin 150mg ER
* Zantac 150mg
* Tylenol 500mg tablets
* Ibuprofen 200mg tablets
* Aspirin 325mg tablets

The percocet I use for back pain and there have easily been dozens of tablets and capsules (1-3 at a time) stored in this pouch. An individual percocet tablet or capsule could have potentially been stored in the pouch for months before being replaced with a new one from the Rx bottle. 

I work in heavy manual labor year round and my medication pouch is either in my pocket or getting thrown around work trucks within my backpack. As a result, it is common for any of my medications to end up broken, partially crushed or even mostly obliterated within the pouch(especially the percocet capsules, of which at least (2) have completely opened and spilled the powder within the pouch). This has left a significant and very visible layer of powder on the bottom of the pouch and prominent residue coating the insides surfaces of the pouch as well as the various medications stored within. 

I have not taken percocet since 1/31/15 since I finished out my last prescription. I have, however, continued to use this pouch as my primary daily dispensing container for the other medications listed above. 

**Here is the problem:** 
I recently began probation and on 1/13/15 and 1/17/15 was given a UA in the probation office. Both tests showed positive for oxycodone. They used a 12-panel 'dip stick' style test which detects oxycodone above 100 ng/ml. I requested lab analysis to verify the positive result as well as to determine the levels present (available in another week). 

**Here are my questions:** 
1) how many mgs of percocet would I have had to inadvertently consume as a result of powder/residue on the medications or my fingers I take daily from the pouch to test positive at a threshold of 100 ng/ml? (my research indicates that .01mg using a 3-4.5 hour half life calculation near the threshold of 100ng/ml)

2) How long after I ingested said residue/powder would I test positive beyond the 100 ng/ml threshold? (Using the 3-4.5 hour half life indicated in my research)

Approximately 1-2 hours before both UA 12 panel tests I took:
 * (1) Welbutrin 150mg ER
* (2) Zantac 150mg tablets
* (2) Tylenol 500mg tablets
* (1) Aspirin 325mg tablet
* (2) Ibuprofen 200mg tablets

All of these medications as well as my fingers had a visible coating of powder/residue. Please help me do the math to show my probation officer and potentially the judge that it is possible for me to test positive for oxycodone under these circumstances and that I am not misusing or obtaining percocet illegally. 

Thank you! ",1424477109.0

When I woke up I felt better. I was scared of pwd after that I understood everyones warning. Then another time, I thought I was good to take a sub, shoot up, get that same chill, and felt like shit.

I am based in Minneapolis, and just wanted to put out word there is a current batch of china cut with fentanyl, which is really easy to OD on so I thought I would plug the state funded harm reduction program I am with, Mainline, which is part of the MNAIDS project, located at 1400 Park Ave.


We are not a one to one exchange, meaning you can always get a free ten pack (27 1/2 usually but we have 28s too right now). We also have various size barrels and tips for methadone, syringes catered to plugging, hormone, and steroids. We also offer gear ie ties, cookers, distilled water, alcohol pads, anti biotic ointment, and 3 sizes of biohazard boxes.


Our current cap is 200, we will match any used syringes (yes we round up, if you come in with like five we will still give you 20) ALL OF THIS IS FREE AND COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS.

We currently are offering narcan on Fridays from 11-1:30 which is slightly less anonymous, we will write an on site Rx but it's NOT on your medical record. As most of you know narcan reverses an opiate overdose, kind of like an epi pen

I would also like to remind everyone about the good samaritan law, aka if you call in an OD and stay with the person until help arrives you are immune to prosecution.

A huge plus side to having biohazard boxes and stickers as well as a card we will give you is that police CANNOT go into a sealed bio box and if you pull out the card they often won't write a paraphernalia ticket, if they do, don't argue, just take it to a judge and in henn co it will get thrown out (this doesn't help with actual possession charges, but it does help and judges like to see you are being safe.cops are more scared of getting poked than shot, so as long as you're honest you're gold. The further away from the city you get the more it varies, but Hennepin judges always do it)

We are open weekdays 11-1 then 3-5, and narcan is 11-1:30 Fridays. If this doesn't jive with your schedule I have a small amount of resources available for emergencies and feel free to pm me, I will ALWAYS pick up bio boxes for people.

We also offer free rapid HIV and hep testing, and a million other resources (free condoms, safe sex kits). It's a super great environment with the least judgmental people ever, because we all have gone through it. We do rule 25s, and have a ton of free community services we can refer you to.

[Here are some pictures of the things we hand out](http://imgur.com/a/CdxEW)

Feel free to pm me with any questions, everyone stay safe and alive! Sorry if this is repetitive, but it's always better to make sure everyone knows there are places like this, as heroin ods are rapidly becoming an epidemic here.

First of all I've been addicted to some sort of opiate for the better part of almost 3 years. And like most of us it started low and small with dros for pain ( legit pain from a c section) and of course tolerance goes up and so does the amount/ drug. Switched to pans and finally herion. In mid November is when I started shooting and my husband knew nothing about it. He's not stupid by any means so obviously most days he knew I was high just didn't know the extent and which drug it was. Well two weeks ago he finds out. Threatens to leave me and take my kids. We kind of work it out and he says I need to get clean and I try I really do but obviously w/ds suck and I can't do it.. He finds out yesterday and it's hell now I don't want any sympathy or the ""you're stupid"" type of comments I feel enough like shit from hearing it from my friends and family. The thing that I'm upset about and hope someone else here can relate to is that my husband believes that I've actively chose my drug over my family. He's not an addict so he doesn't understand. Does anyone else know what I'm talking about or how I feel? Sorry if this doesn't make sense and I'm way off or something. Thanks and pray I can make it through this!",1424460107.0

(Would love to hear from ppl in medical field)","So I have a history of chronic back pain. The ER closest to me was giving me NSAIDs, muscle relaxer & percs. Eventually they told me they couldn't keep giving me narcotics there and I had to see my primary care. Didn't seem suspicious or anything and I was coming in for a legit issue. 

My primary care at the time sucked so I was desperate and went into the ER a couple times w the whole kidney stone bit. Worked great, back felt better, no prob. But I also ended up having to go in for another couple legitimate pain issues too, all of this in a span of about a year. So eventually I get one doc who basically calls me out and I tell her the truth, that I do have bad pain but yes am physically dependent as well. So she gives me clonidine etc which at the time was better than nothing except now it's in my file. 

I've hit up a diff urgent care place and it's been hit or miss. I had one doc give me just 10 pills because she said I came in too often, but then a different doc a couple weeks later gave me 20. (Even 20 isn't shit, but at least it can be stretched to last a few days.) Then the most recent time I come in, I walk out empty handed after another 'You need to find a new primary doc' speech. 

Sorry this is fucking long. Anyways, I do have a new primary care doc, but the soonest I can see her is still 3 days away. I have immodium but I'm in pain and feeling really upset by the fact that I can no longer even rely on going to the fucking hospital for relief. I'm considering hitting up the urgent care yet again but waiting a couple hours just to get a lecture feels like it would break me at this point. 

So my question, is there a good way to go about this? Should I do the kidney ruse again, hoping that they don't want to risk leaving me in pain, or just be honest and say the non-narc pain meds I have aren't helping enough (which is true, I'm having trouble getting anything done) and I'm desperate? I know that I'm probably fucked no matter what, just asking what has the best chance (however slight) of working.

My goal this past year has been to get off dope so I could go down the east coast to NOLA and depending on time and energy maybe go west from there to SOCAL/NORCAL. 

i know if i don't leave soon ill never be able to. I'm getting old and i have to get my shit together, get an education so I can have a decent and stable job. 

plan A would be to go to detox and rehab and then fly out immediately after getting out. id be meeting up with a very trusted girl friend who lives in vancouver, BC and we'd be doing the west coast in her van. so from BC down to SoCal maybe even mexico. i want to go to NOLA but probably not likely with the van since she needs to get back to vancouver.

plan B involves being sick on the road at either starting point of mtl or vancouver. plan B sucks. but it'll suck less in my girl's van. at least id have a place to sleep. and yes she is aware of my condition and is supportive about the whole thing.

so for all you hobos out there with dope addictions, how did y'all deal with that while being on the road? did you eventually just say fuck this and go through withdrawal or did you make it a point to find a place to cop in every city that you passed? how did your trip go? any stories are welcome.

So here is my question-- let's say I crush an OC (or any other crushable pill) and make some lines, but then save some for later. Will leaving the remaining crushed up powder lose potency over time? If so, how long do you think that process would take, and how much potency would you lose? Just to make it a bit more specific, let's say I blow a couple lines before going to sleep, but leave some for the next morning. Is this a bad idea, or does it make no difference?

Part of the reason I asked this is because I remember reading somewhere (unfortunately I can't remember where, but I think it was information from a credible website) that part of the instructions for taking pills in a prescription is that, if you split up a pill or cut it in half, you should take the remainder of that pill the next time you dose. The only reason I thought that would be is because there is some degradation that begins to occur once you split or crush a pill.

""TDTBM PART 5 - The Chase""","The truck was loud as I raced from one neighborhood to the next. But the pervasive roar of the old engine puttered out as I turned off the ignition at the end of the slick driveway. I made my way down the walkway to the front of the building, and I could see that my living room light was turned on.	

“Good,” I thought to myself. My roommate being home was key to this plan. I hustled up to the front.

My roommate jolted forward from the couch when I burst in through the front door.

“Whoaa, what is--

“Marco!” I cut him off “I need your help. I need to borrow your phone.” I was panting from my quick sprint up the stairs.

My roommate was on board after I quickly explained the situation. My roommate was going to let me use his phone in order to access the “Find Your iphone App” and locate my phone.

We fired up the app on his phone, both staring intently at the screen, as if the harder we watched it, the faster it would go. Once the app loaded, I entered in my log-in information and tap “done.”

“That mother-fucker, “ I said aloud, “There he is…”

A little blue dot was moving slowly northbound overlayed on the map of San Francisco in front of me. Trev, if he still had the phone, was walking through a neighborhood called the Tenderloin, right next to the middle of downtown San Francisco.

I thought it would be a good idea to grab some sort of protection as well. I went into the kitchen and looked through my roommate Marco’s shiny array of cooking knives. I grabbed the 9-inch blade, the largest one in the set.

My roommate asked wearily if he should come with. But, in all honesty, he was the type of person to faint at the sight blood from a paper cut. Not that I was a regular Rambo protege myself, but Marco would undoubtedly get in the way and probably end up slowing me down. I told him I’d be alright on my own and vanished through the door before he could object.

I keep checking the phone to make sure Trev was still using it, to make sure he hadn’t turned it off yet. Sure enough, it was still there. The little blue dot floating through the Tenderloin as I mobbed through the East bay at twice the speed limit, headed towards the Bay Bridge once more that day.

When I got to the bridge, I reached again for my roommate's phone. I dialed the number slowly and surely: 9...1….1.

“911, What’s your emergency?” I hear the polite, but firm, lady say over the line.

I take a slight deep breath and respond cautiously, “I...I just got mugged.”

My story was that I was waiting on the sidewalk, leaning on against my truck while using my phone, when I was approached by a white male asking for money. When I declined to give him money, the male then hit me in the face with his fist. And, as I laid on the ground, the guy picked up my cell phone and also quickly went through my unlocked truck. After stealing a few things from my truck, he took off on foot.

I don’t remember exactly how the conversation went, but that was the gist of my story. The 911 operator had a few questions for me and after I answered them, I explained my current situation. I explained how I was on my way back into the City to go after the guy, and how I was using my roommate’s phone to track my stolen phone on a map.

A couple more questions and the 9-1-1 operator put me on hold while she contacted the police.

When she came back, the first thing she said was for me NOT to go after the suspect myself. She was very adamant about that. She was going to have me meet with a police cruiser at Market and 8th. The police officers would take care of him from there.

At the time, I thought it was pretty awesome that they were sending a police car because of a stolen phone. But having some time to reflect on the ordeal, I’ve come to realize they were most likely only sending the police officer’s because of the physical violence, and threat of future violence (i.e. me running after the thief in the ghetto). I’m guessing they really didn’t want me going after the guy by myself in the most dangerous area in SF. 

In other words, it really wasn’t even about the stolen phone to them. In hindsight, I am actually  lucky I worded everything the way I did on that 911 call, or else I might not have gotten that police cruiser to meet up with me. I’ve had friends who have gotten their phones stolen on BART (the Bay Area subway system) only to get the completely off-hands approach of, “you need to come into a police station to file a report,” from the 911 operator.

After speeding through the city I finally arrive at Market & 8th. I park a couple blocks away and head to rest of the way on foot. When I finally arrive, it is full-on night time by now, and the cops are nowhere to be seen.

Market and 8th is usually a pretty bustling stolen goods market, but at this time of the day there was not much going on. I pace back and forth, looking both direction down the street, listening for sirens.

The sirens never came but my head snaps around as I hear the sound of screeching tires behind me. A police cruiser from SFPD comes to a stop in the middle of the road on the West side of 8th Street. I cautiously approach the vehicle.

“Hi, officers--

“Are you the guy who made the call about the mugging and stolen property?” The officer getting out of the driver’s seat said to me.

“Yes, yes that was me.” I reply.

The officer gives me a kind of up-and-down look and says, “Ok then, hop in.”

I make my way into the back of the police cruiser, suddenly becoming more aware of the 9” blade I have sheathed in my front pocket. I make an effort to tell them about it, but before I can they cut me off with more questions.

After retelling the story the same way I told the dispatch person, the officers seem satisfied with the story.

“So, you’re following him with that other phone, right now?”

“Yes,” I say as I show him through the middle window.

“Where is he now?”

I look down at my roommate’s phone and pinch the screen to zoom-in. “Looks like he’s at Leavenworth and Turk, heading west.”

“Ok, hold that phone so I can see it while I drive,” The officer said as he reached back and opened a small sliding window in the middle of the partition. The opening was just about wide enough for my arm to fit through. 

I have to kind of crouch sideways in the footwell. The middle partition was up to my shoulder, I was extending my arm as far as it would go through, with the phone out in front and facing the officer in the driver’s seat.

He flicked at one or two switches on his front control panel and the sirens went blazing as we rocketed off towards the Tenderloin.

I couldn’t help but think how awesome it was to actually have the cops on my side. It was certainly a strange feeling, since I usually am trying my utmost to avoid them. I was white, well-kept, and wore pretty nice clothes, so I’ll be damned if I have a tool at my disposal that I’m too ashamed to use. Fuck that non-sense. I’m out here to inflict as much damage on Trev as possible, no matter my method.

Anyway, so there we go, racing through the TL, siren wailing. I was starting to fear that the siren would ward off Trev, but then I realized that a police siren in the TL is like jazzy music in an elevator, you just kind of expect it.

The knife in my pocket is starting to burn a hole in my pocket. If I know anything about cops, it is that they don’t like surprises and they appreciate having all the information upfront. Wanting to be clear that I was on their side, I spoke to the passenger side policeman:

“Hey I just want you guys to know that I brought a knife with me.”

The officer raised an eyebrow and responds, “You should have told us before you got in the car, take it out please.”

I do as instructed, with my left hand, my only available hand at that moment.

“Jesus Christ. Were you planning on butchering a cow while you were out?” The incredulous officer remarked.

“I just brought it in case, self defense, you know…?” I stammered.

Unbeknownst to me, concealing a blade like the one I had above a certain length was a felony. But it was clear to them that I didn’t have an ulterior motive with the blade so they let it slide (they did end up confiscating it though, and I ended up having to buy my roommate a new one),

The scene unfolding before me must have looked comical if not downright improbable to the outside viewer. There I am, turned sideways, jockeying the backseat of the police cruiser, one had reached through the partition showing the phone to the driver, while my left hand is waving around a recently sharpened 9” serrated cooking blade. Mind you, the car is going about 70 mph over the hilly terrain of San Francisco, so I feel like I’m trying desperately to ride one of those mechanical bulls you find at bars, doing my best just to stay on.

After on more hard right turn, my armpit digging against the metal interior of the partition, the driver flips a switch and the sirens turn off. 

“Were getting close,” He says, “If we are going to make an ID, we’re going to have to do it through you, not through the phone. So start looking out the window, let us know if you see him.”

Up until that point in my life, believe it or not, I had never actually been in the back of a police car. And was surprised at how difficult it was to see out the windows. With all the protective plastics to prevent the window from being kicked out from the inside, it proved very difficult to see out clearly. I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to make a proper ID on Trev.

My eyes squinted, I tried very hard to look every person walking along the sidewalk in the face. It was getting late, so there wasn’t a lot of people out. But we were in the TL, so there’s always going to be people out on the streets, no matter what the time. 

Nothing. Nothing. Not him. Not him. Ugh, not him. At the point when that sinking feeling began to return, I see the back of a small white kid in a big t-shirt, it could be Trev, but I need a better view. Unfortunately, as we are driving down the street, we were approaching an over-sized 20 ft. construction dumpster that was blocking our line of sight. When we get to the end of the dumpster, I tell the driver cop to slow down, as I think he might be coming around the dumpster.

After a few moments of intense waiting, I see Trev slowly round the corner of the metal container, directly to the right to the side of the cop car.

“That’s him!” I yell, “That’s him, right there!”

In unison the two police officers jump out of the cruiser and accost Trev. Trev didn’t even realize what was happening until the last second. He had been looking down, typing something into my phone, smiling.

Relief. Sweet, sweet relief I felt as I watched Trev sit solemnly on the sidewalk, hands handcuffed behind his back. It was almost as satisfying as the facial expression I saw on Skeet’s face earlier in the day.

Trev tries to convince the police that I had given him the phone. But, of course, the cops weren’t having any of it.

As I sit there, I see another cop car pull up and they throw Trev in the back. A new police officer I’ve never seen before brings over my phone. After I prove to him it is my phone, he takes it back and tells me that I will get it back at the station.

Once we got to the station it was pretty uneventful. I made a statement and made small talk with the officers.

At one point the officer said, “And looks like that is where he gotcha, huh?” pointing to my face.

I was confused at first but then I remembered I had punched myself, so as to leave a mark, when I originally found out Trev jacked me.

“Yup,” I reply, “He punched me right here,” I point to my cheek. They took a picture of it as evidence.

The cops were actually pretty cool, they kept reminding me that I was the victim and I didn't need to be afraid of the guy that stole from me. Chuckling to themselves, they also told me the Trev was making up some ‘dumb story’ about me wanting to buy drugs through him.

When I left the station, it was well past midnight. There was a police station in the Tenderloin, but for some reason they took us to a different one, much farther away from where I had parked.

The air was brisk, and I was cold again. I kept a good pace to keep my body temperature up, I still had about 10 block to walk before I got to my truck. Overall, I had gotten back everything that Trev stole except for the headphones, which I considered a fair price to pay for a shiny new assault charge on Trev’s record. Trev must have hawked them quickly or just stashed them somewhere, I didn’t care.

I found myself reflecting on the day and what had happened so far. I was still feeling tense but, ultimately, I was glad to finally be on my way home.

After a brisk walk, I find myself back where I parked the truck. I jump in and immediately turn on the heater. I start driving to where I think I can get on the freeway, but end up getting lost in some of the one-way streets in the Tenderloin. No problem, whatever. I take a second to pull over to the side of the street and grab my phone to pull up the Google Maps app.

It was when I glanced up ahead of me at the street signs, trying to figure out my location, when I saw her.

Although the sidewalk was poorly lit, I’d recognize that dyed red hair anywhere.

i got a 0.2 off the darkweb, i used such a small amount the bag doesnt hardly look touched. when this bag is gone i wont be buying it again, i dont much think its my drug of choice and i dont want to dance with the devil for too long. 

it was an impulse buy and i partly regretted it as soon as id bought it.

it felt like your usual opiate high but with moments where i was lucid followed by moments where i would be very sedated. the itchies were nothing much compared to opium or codeine. i didnt nod out but maybe thats cus i didnt do enough, i didnt want to be sick so i took it slow.

im pretty fucking spooked that i did it, but like i said when this bags gone its gone and i wont do it again. im not planning on chipping or anything even. its unlikely ill finish the whole bag im considering throwin it out.

The psychological urge to use up what ive left is there, but not as strong as other drugs . and i know the feeling is only there cus i know ive still got some left. with frequent use does this urge become stronger? is that where the addiction stems?

ill buy opium again but not this, the negatives risks just aint worth it. i got pretty chaotic with stims during my teens so i know how shit can get out of control and ive learnt how to limit myself now.",1424706520.0

Also had promised my partner I would try to get a script to replace pills he had given me. Well, I decided that it was silly to go in and sit in a waiting room for hours when I can get in with my new primary doc on Tues. 

Giant fight ensues. Really shitty first half of the day. Ended up getting in a physical fight w my partner - I slammed a door on him as he was leaving, he punched me which broke my glasses. (He thinks he can fix them but damn, I loved those fucking glasses.) 

I'm fuming and end up heading to urgent care... change my mind halfway there. I had posted before that I dried up my own poppy seed source, the store said they would no longer be stocking them. But for whatever reason I suspected that might have been a lie, so I stop in there on my way home. 

Lo and behold, lots of seeds! I buy a couple bags. Not only did they have them, but they are a great batch. (Last time this store restocked, the seeds looked a bit different, more bits of blue in them, weren't as potent.) About an hour after my first 1/2 lb, I notice I'm really relaxed, smiling. Hadn't been expecting much result so wasn't placebo. Such a good batch. Hopefully gonna go back and buy more bags (assuming they didn't pull 'em from the shelves lol) tomorrow to get me by until *hopefully* my doc comes through. 

Wish I could get my partner to just try the seeds. He sells his extra pills (overpriced too I'm pretty sure) and has a low tolerance. It'd be a good solution. 

Need to work on bettering myself. My partner thinks it's just the drugs that make me not work on myself. Really it's an underlying health issue - maybe thyroid, maybe something else, but my body has felt like a prison since having my second kid. Can't lose weight, always in pain, lots of other issues. Still, I could be doing more. Need to stock up on seeds for backup as it isn't DRUGS that make me a shitty person, it's the way I am when I can't get them/am anxious about pain/wd, etc. I'm sure ppl can relate. ",1424681431.0

But he's a cool-ass dude; everyone freaking loves the guy, and me and him get along really well, always talking about fishing, music, cars, and guns. It came up that the only guns I have are my short barreled 12 gauge and a Mosin Nagant rifle, but no handguns.  

It should be noted that my main hassle is middlemanning; I've brought him at least a half dozen new regulars this way, with me accepting all the risk of meeting and dealing with new people we don't know, and who might either rob me or might be LEOs. So, with my birthday coming up, my DBoy tells me he worries about me being unarmed and potentially getting robbed, and that as long as I go and get my handgun license (my record is clean, should be no problem), he's gonna take me to a firearm dealer and buy me my first handgun! I've never had a relationship with a dealer before that was anywhere near as cool as with this guy.  

Also, my dad, who I happen to run a business with, noticed that a lot of my money was ""disappearing"", and confronted me about my drug use, which I ended up admitting to. Rather than firing me and being all angry and shunning me, he demanded that I get clean (and I'm ready to), and said he's gonna do whatever it takes to help me do so, including getting me into a rehab, or paying to have me see a sub doctor, or whatever route we choose. He's already called my mom (they're divorced), and they've begun to research rehabs, trying to figure out the best way to help me get clean. He then says that it's gonna have to wait for at least two weeks; we're booked solid and he absolutely needs me to be there, working. I tell him, I won't be able to work while sick (we do physical labor), and he *does* know I'll have to use to remain useful at all. He says he knows, and to do whatever it takes to make it to work for the next couple weeks. So basically, my dad now knows I use, and has condoned it, for the time being. Not at ALL what I expected to happen, and now I know I have at least two weeks to get in my last hurrahs.

Woke up with mad headache and feeling cold from the inside out. Took more oxycontin to fix it.,"Background: Not opiate naive. I take hydrocodone every night (helps me sleep/helps my stomach/induces appetite that I lack), 10 mg is enough to make me comfortable for like 2 hours, more than 10 is ideal, ie 15-20-25. 
So I fucked with oxycontin for the first time. Took the whole OP 20. I definitely appreciated that it brought back that opiate warmth for me that is hard to come by and lasted longer than any other opiate I've ever taken. But I have stomach problems and it didn't help as much with the stomach as hydro. Also, while hydro is guaranteed to turn me ridiculously optimistic if I take enough, to the point where I will just constantly be thinking about how great life is, I feel like oxy could perhaps be more emotionally deadening. Anyways, went to sleep pretty comfortably, slept a ridiculous amount of time because when I woke up early I felt so damn fatigued and cold and didn't want to get out of bed. And the headache was just ridiculous. Anyways, took more oxy to get back to feeling regular temperature and to kill the headache. 
Is this a normal post-oxy reaction? And also I definitely prefer hydrocodone, I am positive that I won't get hooked on this because I am just using this while I wait for more hydro. ",1424669810.0

My question is, why the hell can I not stop thinking about this all day every day and what advice can you give to me.  I know I shouldn't do this, that's pretty obvious, but I know myself and I am going to get something some how.  I've thought of faking back pain and going the doctor route but it's hard to get a script for anything from my doctor and my wife would be suspicious if I was trying to get pain meds and then didn't act injured at home too.  I know I'm rambling, I'll stop.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks.",1424664506.0

the walk home was a painful blur down the El Camino.  inside i prepared to WD.  the puke bucket, jug of water, blankets and remote for TV.  as it intensified i saw hell which is normal when you shoot up 3-5 times a day and personally know heaven.

during the visions of the Incan rain god laughed as i puked bile and turned a pale purple corpse gray.  then Mary came home.  she looked at me knew what i was up to.  without a word she sat down next to me and fixed a shot.  ""Sal was looking for you babe.  Why'd you leave?""

i hated her.  but my eyes stared at her hands expertly prepping a fat shot of bliss that would embrace me back to heaven.  Mary talked about how she was up $350 on meth sales because the fools at the bar thought they were buying coke.  then she pulled back the blanket and sunk the needle into my arm.  i barely use my arm as i pretend i am not a junkie.  this was the sweeeeeet spot....

after a serious nod i showered and went with her to mcdonald's to eat and watch her sell a big bag of meth to her mexican connect Ricki the gardener.  she casually did a bump off her wrist while deciding what to eat and took off her sunglasses before she reached the cashier and ordered food.  she transformed into a 20something young and healthy brunette.  maybe a student or young office worker.  the cashier was smitten.  

at the table she smiled and said What was last night about babe?  

i am done, i said though i was fortified by opiate numbness to my core.  

Mary smiled like a lazy snake and slid over bag.  it hid beneath my sausage mcmuffin wrapper.  present babe from Ricki.  lets split it in the bathroom.  you prep the shots and i'll suck your cock.

i stared at my girlfriend.  she was the devil.  i would never come and she had no intention of finishing me.  but we would shoot that fucking bag.  i would drive us home.  we would watch TV until we passed out arm in arm.  i always think we would be perfect in the coffin like this.  ",1424664310.0

We drove through twice because it didn't feel right...while driving through we saw 3 cops posted up on different corners and one trolling the block that spotted us at least a couple times and even stopped at a corner and watched us pull into the spot before I looked at my boy and told him this was a bad idea..  
  
He agreed without hesitation...we knew we were playing with fire...but it is what is...we've all been there right?

I have noticed that the southern coastal states (and the closer to the cost or a port city) have better dope than the land locked southern states. Idk, maybe I just have not found the right guy to go to yet to get the gray kind, but it gets me well so I can't complain too much!

But what I wanted to ask was what would be a good way to progress through the different opiates slowly, bearing in mind that the better ones make the weaker ones seem obsolete?

I feel like I want to enjoy the spectrum of opiates and enjoying each one fully without the thought that I should have just spent my money on some more x instead. Obviously ROA has a large part to play in this as well.

every now and then you meet a kind dealer.  someone who ignores the predatory aspects of heroin abuse because they are decent and human.  carla was the least obvious dealer i ever met.  claims she was doing it for her boyfriend who was forklift operator on the Oakland docks.  

though she had no holes in her skin, carla used.  a part time paralegal and no stranger to smoking and snorting she kept her use light hearted.  she had to because of jen and jess her daughters.  jen was maybe 9 and the most responsible one in the house.  she reminded carla of important dates she had marked out on a disney calendar or meal planned for her and her sister.  

to get into carla place was hard.  i knew her boyfriend from rehab and they had me over to eat a few times before H was sold.  i only met 2 other clients of hers - both white collar professionals like myself.

you could sample in their condo but you took it in the bathroom and were expected to hold normal conversation afterwards because her kids would definitely ask you something like Do you have a girlfriend?  Do you like pizza?  at first this was weird but after awhile i grew entranced by these tiny pure souls who did not judge me.  i brought over my old playstation2 and all the games for them.  this earned me a fat bag from carla.  

they had 30+ games but would usually play GTA Vice City.  but not in the cool violent way.  they would steal a car, turn on the radio and park.  then they would draw or play dolls or legos while listening to the weird 80's music.  as a child of the 80's and high as fuck on horse i found this incredibly amusing.

the number dried up one weekend.  i let it go for a week.  i went by their place, knocked, no one answered.

I got help from my mom writing a resume. I learned how go write on in HS but that was 8-9 years ago and had never written one for real. So when finished I was very happy with it and sent it off honestly not expecting to hear back. I should state I have been working in the security industry for almost 3 years but with very little of that in a retail enviornment. They also wanted someone with experience in security camera programs which I have non of. I figured they would have many better applicants than me but with the pressure from my mom I applied anyways. Lo and behold they called me a couple hours ago to set up an interview for tommorow. I am super excited because the company I work for now has absolutley no advancment potential and unreliable hours. Its simply a career steping stone. The reason I am writing this is that it just hit me..... I cant pass a drug test. Not a shot in hell. I was doing a shot as they called me lol. The ad didnt say anything about one and didnt say anything on the phone about one. Now I am petrified that it will be put on me tommorow at the interview where I will fail it with flying colors.

Told him to just try dope just this once so he wouldn't get sick. He says OK..here's 700 dollars ""will that get me enough to last 3-4days"" (he takes about 10-15 oxy a day and I charge him premium...so he is used to spending 150-250 a day) ...

..anyway I say yeah I'm pretty sure that'll be enough. Buy a half ounce of some decent tar and give him 4 grams.. To him it looked like a huge amount as I to!d him he only needed a popcorn kernal size piece to get well. He calls me back few hours later and is happy as hell...says not only did it get him well but he feels great...lol

So I scored 8 grams for 45 minutes of driving around. 

Bonus he says he turned his boss(he does graphic design ..shit like packaging design for bags of chips n shit like that) on to a piece of the dope as they usually share pills and he wants some now too. Hell when I hook guy up with say 100 oxy I make 300 bucks...if he spends that much on dope I'll be scoring like 12-15 grams! 

...until he finds someone else who doesn't totally rip him

I tell myself that I'm doing the guy a favor. He has more money than brains and if I gave him an actual half/12g  he would end up with a wicked habit pretty fast...this way I'm helping keep his tolerance lower......right?

Tell me I'm a good boy ;-)

Oh and how does snap chat work? If anyone want to see what 20 Oz's of our favorite poison looks like all golfbal!ed up lmk..OK more like them mandarin Ora hges than golfba!!slol

Edit

Got the guy a quarter ounce. Only charged him 400 bucks (which is going street prices right now. I've seen 120 grams) is fair!y fair $10 per point. Except he doesn't own a scale and doesn't know things like points,grams,balls, ect.

So I only took 1.5 off his 6 grams and I didn't step on it at all. I warned the guy that for street potency here in the home of Nirvana this stuff was fairly top notch..to ta!e it easy.

So guess you guys calling me a greedy asshole got !me realizing that I was fucking this guy way too hard... Hell he probably has rich user friends that I could meet so I should treat him better.

I know taking 25% of a guys sack isn't the coolest but better than taking 66% percent. 

The look on his face when he got MORE for 400 than he did for 700 before WAS MAGIC. I told him that I knew some well placed and generous D boys and some that were greedy fuckers (heeheehee  8:::::::(  So that some days it'll be great deal and some it won't.

(started lurking around when I was 15) I'm 18 now. Anyways, I have a few issues that I have and I'm just looking for advice, tips or anything really.

 I just recently had surgery on my ankle and I have two prescriptons for 90 tablets of roxicodone 5's. I've been trying my hardest on keeping myself distracted and telling myself that these tablets are solely for pain relief. So far, I've been doing good. I'm taking the pills as prescribed and no matter how bad the pain gets, I still push myself to wait until my next scheduled dose. The issue is that I've struggled with addiction and oxycodone has always been my drug of choice. I have been through my fair share of experiences with opiates, good and bad. I've seen all the good things and in result, I've also had bad things happen, including hospitalizations and OD'ing. I've kept it in control for the most part in years, however I am not completely clean from it. I still take pills every now and then, I fucking love it. And since I'm taking oxycodone around the clock, I'm pretty much high all the time. Besides the pain I get every once in a while, I've really enjoyed the past week. It feels so fucking good, and most of you know what I'm talking about. I guess I just want some advice or tips on how to prevent myself from falling into a full blown relapse? 

On a side note, any sugguestions for what to eat, what meds to take or what to do so I can be pooping? Lol. I hate being so constipated.

“Oh Hey! Lucas. I was wondering if I was ever going to see you again!”

She seemed to be in a really good mood. She probably had just fixed or something.

Before I could respond to her, she swings her hand in front of my face and says, “Look at this!”

She was showing my some sort of god-awful ugly ring on her index finger.

“It’s just beautiful, ain’t it?” She says with a huge smile on her face, showing off her infected gums.

“Oh wow, yeah, that’s... nice,” I reply sarcastically, “Did you happen to buy it with the money you stole off me?”

“Sweetheart, this here is real, genuine, rose gold, and green emeralds. This ain’t no quarter-machine ring. This is worth way more than your $60 dummy” Her eyes veer off to the side and I catch her in a moment of thought as she realizes she just admitted, in a roundabout way, to stealing my money.

She took a puff of the cigarette she was working on and continued, “and anyway, I didn’t steal the money off you. I passed out, and when I came down to bring you the benzos, you were gone. You left.”

I didn’t matter to argue with her, the was no chance in getting her to admit to stealing from me. I also knew it was pointless to try and get my money back too because it was surely long-gone.

She then looked up at me with curious glance.

“Hey weren’t you looking for something to help get you through withdrawals?” She asked me.

“Uh, yeah,” I responded cautiously.

“Well, I’ve got something for you then,” she replied as she held out a prescription bottle in front of me.

I squinted my eyes to get a better look at the pills inside. Except there weren’t any pills inside. It looked like it was filled with some sort of...liquid? I asked her what it was.

“It’s G-water, GHB, you know, date rape stuff. This shit will knock you out. Won’t even know you’re going through withdrawals. Cause you won’t even be awake, gonna date rape yourself! Get it?” Her raucous laughter made me cringe. But it was just another one of many insidious noises that she’s constantly making.

I thought about her offer, “Ehh...why not? Sure, i’ll take it.” I figured it might help me get to sleep during withdrawal, and apparently she was offering it to me in recompense for the failed benzo transaction earlier.

When I went out to grab it, she snatched her hand away--

“That’ll be $60, sweetheart,” she had the gall to say. It was the exact amount that she owed me, no less.

“Are you kidding me? You owe me $60, just give me this, and we’ll be cool.”

“Sorry sweetie. But I already told you, your money from earlier is long gone. I need $60 or you’re not getting this.” She wagged the bottle in front of me.

There was no way I was giving her any more money, even though she did have the product right in front of me. I didn't really feel like giving any more money to people who were pieces of shit that day. I thought about how I could get it from her, trying to come up with some scheme or ploy.

“Ok,” I said, “follow me, the money is in my car.”

I get in the drivers seat, and rather than letting her sit in the passenger seat, I keep the door locked and only roll down the window halfway. This way, she has to remain standing, outside the vehicle.

I reach my hand out to her and say, “I need to make sure it’s legit before I give you the money. I’m not gonna let you fuck me twice today.”

Rosie rolls her eyes, and reluctantly hands me the bottle.

I taste the liquid. I had never taken GHB before, so I didn’t really know what I was doing. I suppose I was just making sure it didn’t taste like water. I remember it tasting a little sweet, but not sugary sweet. The taste was very difficult to pinpoint. Either way, by the texture of the liquid I could tell there was something in there besides water. It was probably legit.

I put the medicine bottle in the cupholder and glance over to the passenger door to make sure that it is locked, and then look up to Rosie.

Then, with my left hand hitting the switch to roll up the passenger window, I look at Rosie. I say, “You know what Rosie? On second thought, why don’t you just put it on my tab? I think that’ll make us even anyway, right?”

And as I’m talking, I’m letting the truck begin to roll forward. Moments after, I finally punch my foot forward as I say “Go fuck yourself Rosie.” The frame of the truck shutters slightly as the engine revs and the vehicle lurches forward. 

As could be expected, Rosie started to scream like a pig being fucked by a horse, “No, NoOoO, money! Money! You give me!” She could barely make out her words as she struggled along with the moving car. She managed to get one of her arms in the window up to about her elbow before I could roll it up all the way, unfortunately. Her other hand was desperately gripping the back window of the cab, so she was sort of hugging the truck while she awkwardly tried to run along with it.

“God damnit, Rosie! Go Away!” I yell at her, “We are even now you stupid bitch!”

...10 mph...15 mph...20 mph, yet still, she held on--making some sort of crack head and donkey hybrid noises all the while. I was starting to get worried that we were making too much of a scene. But I looked around quickly and didn’t see any other cars that could see us. There were probably some people watching from the street, but they were undoubtedly homeless at this hour.

I purposely start to drift over to the cars parked along the sidewalk. I figure I could get close enough to the other vehicles to where she’d have to let go voluntarily, or otherwise risk getting smashed between cars. We played a game of chicken and I lost. I got pretty close to side swiping the car on my right, which probably would have killed her, mind you, but she held on. 

I started to speed up even more.

25mph….30 mph…I looked over and I could see the determination in her eyes, I knew she wasn’t going to give up easily. She was still holding on to the outside of the truck, wailing her lungs out.

I start to veer left, then right. I punch the brakes. Floor it. Swing right, left, right again, trying anything to loosen her hold on the truck. 

I try rolling up the window again. By the loud shrill of a scream she let out, it was clear the window rolling up on her right arm was causing her a lot of pain. I go back and forth on the window lever, up, down, up down, up.

Finally, she’d had enough of the window. I rolled it up one last time, and was able to tighten it’s hold on her arm between the window and the top of the door frame, but somehow she is still able to pull her arm out. I hear her tumble from the right side of the truck, but I had to look forward at the same moment to avoid colliding with a parked car.

I look to the right again and see that Rosie is no longer there. 

Only, my relief is short lived when a sudden “boom” sound comes from the roof, reverberating  throughout the small cab. I look in my rear view mirror and see Rosie’s ugly mug staring right back at me. Somehow, that clever crackhead had maneuvered her way into the truck bed.

It was hard to say, due to the missing teeth, but I think she was smiling. She yelled at me, “I ain’t leaving ‘till I get my money you assh--

She’s got cut off when her face suddenly slammed into the sliding window in front of her as I hit on the brakes.

I grabbed my wallet from my back pocket and got a fist full of ones, and fives, the rest of my cash. My heart sank a little as I momentarily stared at the empty wallet before me. From the gold I had pawned earlier in the week, I had started the day with several hundred dollars. And what, exactly, did I have to show for it? A shoddy bottle of ‘maybe’ GHB? 

“Here!,” I say begrudgingly as I rolled down the window and tossed the wad of cash on the ground beside the idling vehicle, “You win, here’s your fucking $60! Now get the fuck out of here before I change my mind and beat the fuck out of you.” I don’t think it was actually $60, but by the time she finished counting I’d be long gone anyway.

She hastily climbed out of the back and turned her crack-induced focus from me to picking up the money on the ground. I couldn’t help but notice how much she looked like “Gollum” from the “Lord of the Rings” at that particular moment.

I punched the pedal forward and speed out of that situation. I was thinking to myself how badly I wanted to do a shot.

That feeling eventually got the best of me when I remembered I still had the little piece of black that I had finger-nailed from the chunk I gave Skeet earlier. It wasn’t much, but it was better than nothing.

Plenty far enough away from Rosie. I start scanning the streets for a good spot to shoot up. I eventually found a perfect parking spot outside of a 24/7 pawn shop. I had been driving kind of frantically since Rosie got off, just in a general direction toward the bridge. So I wasn’t exactly sure which neighborhood I was in at this point.

I parked the car up along side the pawn shop. The bright neon lights from the store lit up the inside of my cab, which would be perfect for fixing. I wouldn’t have to risk turning on an inside light, which will always draw unwanted attention to any parked car.

At the same moment I reached in to my center console, a small flash of light caught the corner of my eye. The flash came from the floor of the passenger seat. I had to unbuckle to reach it. It was a small object, and as I pulled it into the light I realized it was…. a ring. A woman’s ring. It was Rosie’s ring.

“Holy shit!” I mutter in disbelief.  It must have fallen off when her hand squished out of the window. When she pulled her hand out, the ring must have caught in between the window and door frame and popped off, dropping to the floor.

I smile to myself as my field of vision slowly moves up, from the ring in my hand to the 24/7 Pawn Shop sign that was flashing brightly in my face.",1424922493.0

Was active for a while around this time last year and then posted about my ibogaine experience in october. Been shooting dope for 4 years and have abused drugs since that was possible. My only formal detox was 2 years ago right after I graduated college, was clean for 6 months and slowly progressed to doing speedballs which I hadn't gotten really into before. I cleaned up for a bit around June, I guess I should add that I have had a 6 figure plus job since I graduated and I was living at home and depressed after leaving the 24/7 party that college was and moving back to Hell, NNJ suburbia while kinda having a habit and learning how to become a real person. End of July I say fuck it and move to bk because it made work easier and I always wanted to live in NYC but I dig bk so I did that. Fucked up really hard in bk for August, started 12 stepping in bk. Fucked up again, went to ibogaine in oct. Came back and kicked ass for a bit, but I spent what little time id been in bk going to meetings and meeting those people but I haven't been back there and won't. So I spent most of the winter alone and depressed because I didn't know anyone and wasn't doing much while having the financial ability to do anything reasonable in the fucking city that never sleeps (aka serious existential crisis)

Recently though life has been pretty awesome, I have been using but I've been keeping it functional with work and I'm even meeting girls, having dates, making new friends and living a healthy life outside using. I feel depressed when I think about how I use, but it makes me feel good and my legal risk is almost zero (compared to my once routine of driving to Paterson every other day) and financially I don't think about it.

So I guess has anyone else just said fuck it I'm going to use for now because at this point the only imperative negatives stem from how I feel about my use. When I try out the mind frame of ""this is ok right now"" life seems to be so gravy.

I realize that I might be in the wrong place, and I apologize if I am, but I didn't know where else to go. I'm about to sound incredibly stupid and ignorant, so I apologize in advance for that as well. So I'm 20 year old girl currently in undergrad at a very good university on the East Coast. I've been ambitious, curious, self-motivated, and goal-oriented my entire life. I want to go to law school or if not that go to grad school and go into teaching. I've got lovely friends, awesome parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins that I love to death. I like to read and write and play music and sing and I want to publish some short stories and creative nonfiction pieces and get married and have children and host dinner parties and be a creative, thriving person in the world.

I struggle with depression and it is very, very difficult to live in this world when I constantly have to justify my own existence to myself. 70% of the time the loudest thought in my mind is *""What's the fucking point?""* I have been very suicidal at more than one point in my life. If heroin is *soooo fucking good* as so many people make it out to be, then I'm honestly willing to let go of my friends, family, and everything I described above if it means feeling good all the time, or even feeling nothing at all and not giving a shit. I've smoked weed thrice in my life and only drink socially, so this is a huge leap for me. Still, these days heroin just seems like more and more of an attractive option.

I know that, worst case scenario, it will make me sick, broke, homeless, alone, and devoid of any will to live. Honestly, once that point comes, if it comes, I would be willing to end things there and kill myself. Getting clean isn't even an option in my mind--if I get into this I don't expect to get out, and for whatever fucked-up reason, I'm okay with that.

I've been researching it extensively--where to get it, how to score, how to shoot up, etc.--and it's just becoming more and more of a real option for me. I'm not looking to ""just try it once,"" I'm not going to fight it or moderate it. I'm looking to commit to it and all the things that come with it.

I'm envisioning the rest of my life--experiencing the best feeling humanly possible and then offing myself--and it honestly does not sound like such a bad idea at all. It would devastate the people I care about who care about me, but I figure if I'm always either high or looking for my next fix I won't care. I won't care about anything, anyone, or myself. I don't know. It seems like the best way to destroy myself.

Of course, I'm obviously not 100% committed to this decision because I'm posting here and asking you to convince me otherwise. Convince me that everything I described in the first paragraph is better than heroin. Because right now throwing my life away and then dying sounds like a wonderful idea.",1425012472.0
2xbgsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xbgsy/the_absurdity_of_how_addiction_is_treated_and_how/,32,https://redd.it/2xbgsy,Research-away,The absurdity of how addiction is treated and how psychology in general is so far behind other areas of medicine (due to ignorance and stigma),"I know there are some intelligent folks in this sub, some who have gotten undergraduate degrees from a liberal arts college I can only assume have had these thoughts at some point in their addiction  (not that it matters but liberal arts degrees require mandatory humanities courses along with other courses which are aim at teaching students critical thinking skill that are applicable in all aspects of life). Mostly though anyone who has lived this life long enough to experience the depressing state of affairs that the medical community is in with their ability to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. 


&nbsp;


The treatment of addiction is the only first-hand experience I have with the mental health system in the US. Casual researching and talking to people about their experience with mental health professionals has made me come to the conclusion that people who seek professional help for  common mild cases of mental illnesse, depression is an easy example, are met with the same dilemma which is that success rates of known pharmaceutical treatments are so abysmal that recovery rates of those that don't seek treatment are close enough that most people don't go to see a doctor about it. Sometimes in fear of the side effects of the medication negatively impacting quality of life more so than the illness itself.


&nbsp;


I assume the majority of people who don't seek treatment do so because of the negative stigma attached to having a mental illness. Perhaps the stigma is logically grounded though, if people who seek professional help and get prescribed a regimine of medications and therapies by a doctor and recover at a relatively similar rate as those who pick themselves up by the proverbial boot straps and make changes in their life without professional help of course it would appear that the person who sought professional help was weak and probably lazy. We here especially probably know all too well that everything is not always as it appears. Perhaps the  person who got professional help was not at a point in her/his life where making drastic changes were possible, think of a parent who just went through a divorce and had to pick up a second job to keep the heat on this winter. We unconsciously make generalization so we can remember things more easily, this is why there are stereotypes and stigmas.


&nbsp;


Psychology as a medical science and practice is infantile compared to other areas of medicine. There's obviously still a lot of social stigma around mental health which negatively impacts advancements. I was discussing this with a friend and she proposed that if psychology advanced at the same rate as other fields of medicine we would have medicine as effective as penicillin that would cure someone of addiction. I disagree and said that years of addiction can not be solved by taking a pill for a week, there is a lot of shit that needs healing after that. 


&nbsp;


When an athlete hurts their bodies after years of abusing it they need physical therapy relative to the extent of damage done and the health of the althete's body which will determine how well it heals. Just like addicts, the athlete may never be fully healed and the effects of the abuse put on the body will be seen long after it stops. Physical therapy is usually covered by insurance (mine is) whereas talk therapy rarely is completely covered and usually restricted to a certain number per year (like mine). 


&nbsp;


What's the difference between the athlete and junkie? We've turned this into a moral issue, both had knowledge that what they were doing would inevitably cause health problems down the road but continued (perhaps under the hope of being the exception or the philosophy that they would rather live doing what they enjoy and accept the consequences that may arise). When an athlete enters physical therapy they have many tests run that look at the particular case and a specialized doctor determines what the best treatment would be that would maximize the recovery of Her patient. Sure other doctors may prescribe a different course of action but the fact is that there are treatments in this field of medicine that are widely agreed upon and proven to work through scientific research. 


&nbsp;


Let's look at addiction, 12 step programs are probably the most widely prescribed recommendation to addicts. Not to say that other fields of medicine don't have procedures that are contested, however data is collected and the procedures are tested so we quantitatively know how effective they are. There is never any question to if a procedure works, that would be absurd, instead we question how come the success rates of a specific procedure is so low and how can we increase it. Why the fuck are we still treating people with a potentially deadly disease with a therapy (aa/Na) which has an unknown success rate and is rooted in the idea that it doesn't change. 


&nbsp;


I don't bash people who get help through aa/Na just like I don't bash people who are very religious, it interests me that people can subscribe to things that go against logic and science in an age where data and information are so accessable. Also I guess I was raised to always question things, especially anything that is not grounded in logic or science. I was taught that I would fall to ignorance and risk being disingenuous to myself and others unless I was skeptical of things that were not tested or prove. Especially question something that others say not to question, anything that claims to be infallible is hiding something. That was my main problem with AA/NA, members are not supposed to question the program because the program is perfect how it is. 


&nbsp;


This leads into my main argument as to why the rehab industrial complex is a money machine devoid of morals. The people who make the business decisions at these places are smart people who know that a large portion of patients, that are paying absurd amounts of money, will become repeat customers.  The cold hard truth is that a most people who go to rehab will statistically, therefore inevitably, relapse. When we relapse the fault does not fall on the rehabs or aa/Na's fault but it is our fault, their system is perfect if we just do it ""right"" this time it will be better. I don't get it though, we are supposed to be sick people, it's paradoxical to hold both things true. It especially doesn't make sense how it's not clear the rehab didn't accomplish shit when someone uses within 24 hours of getting out. If we are sick people don't make rehab a camp where we can eat well, fuck, smoke cigs, and be away from dope for at least a few days.

This makes some of us (like myself) even more disillusioned by the system, especially because most people who have worked in the system for long enough are jaded from being apart of something that doesn't work or are convinced the only thing that does work is surrendering and going to AA/NA. Many people who work these places were active addicts not too long ago, this is not a bad thing, in fact I think it's necessary to have staff around you that understands or at least had the capacity to understand what you've gone through, and more important to your time at the facility a clean addict will understand from experience what you're currently going through whereas the trained medical staff will only be able to understand so much. Hopefully the addict staffers will be more real about what you'll face after you leave and it's necessary that this person be as to provide suggestions beyond ""Go to AA if you're for real"".. 


&nbsp;


For a few grand a day I should have people who went to school for years to specialize in treating addiction and are well known in the field. The doctor(s) treating the patient should be confident in the treatment they are providing because they have seen it be successful time after time. Some might say my standards are too high and that's not true, I think we have been sold bullshit for a long time and the system in place teaches that we should not question it people will say ""The program works you've just never really worked the program"", ""Take what you need and leave the rest"", etc., etc.. It becomes infallible gospel that people will aggressively defend because they believe it saved their lives. It's a well built system that makes itself strong by it's members being strong and confident that it works for them. That is not how things work in science, there needs to be some sort of analysis otherwise it's bs. If we don't make noise nothing will change...

 Gets me mad to think how perfectly it fits into the rehab industrial complex, obviously the industry was built around 12 step programs. Instead of having to go through the process of research and development they picked the 12 step program because it's a businessman's wet dream. Not only do customers become repeat business but the holy grail is that the rehabs don't have to actually prove they helped anyone beyond the time spent at the facility. Fucking genius. Then they spent the money saved from skipping the research and development phase on lobbying and greasing enough hands to get addiction classified as a disease meaning insurance would now pay so the price could exponentially increase. AA started out as a program to help people for free but it has clearly been integrated into a business model and some people are making a lot of money by keeping things the way they are so you have to assume they are spending money to make sure nothing changes too. 


Edit: Really happy this didn't get buried and people are discussing the subject. I'd like to hear from people who disagree though and hear their reasoning, I know you're out there and by contributing I can learn about your position more.

My company is just WAY too busy right now for me to be absent, so I've just been doin my tar for now, as per usual. When I hit the slow spot in out schedule in two weeks, I will most likely be checking into an inpatient detox to get clean. 

However, I just now today found a sub hookup. So, my question is this: would it be better to just keep doing tar until the rehab (where I'll most likely be starting subs there anyways), or should I start buying subs and use those instead until rehab? Would it be cheaper? I smoke a $50 gram of tar a day, and I can get 8mg strips of sub for $20; I dunno how much sub I'd need for that habit. Is it even worth it? Would I have to go without for a couple days before taking the subs? I can't be dope sick and still work. Any advice?

P.S: I know, I know, I'm just another dumbass with a question about subs. Sorry.",1425000408.0

...oh but wait. You can switch over to ""a cheaper, safer, and less addictive opiate replacement than methadone, SUBOXONE!"" <---- Most ignorant comment I have ever read.

Have your clinics been talking to you about this / preparing you for such a move? Have you gotten any written letters in the mail from medicare telling you about the issue, or that you might need to start tapering soon?

Are you worried? If they do cut funding for state funded methadone patients, will you switch to suboxone (which they are saying they will pay for)? Will you go back to dope? Or will you just taper off methadone and try life without opioids?

I am a footnote, a sentence in parentheses, an item just barely remembered when it was almost too late. 

I have forgotten myself. 

I love too much. I give myself away and don't think twice. When I'm alone it's like I am vapor just barely hanging on to human form. When I'm alone, my heart skips beats; stasis is my form of living. 

Being alive..... What does that mean? It can't be breathing, blood pumping through veins, the heart doing its thing. My heart beats only in tandem. I breathe in plural. 

This isn't fun, it isn't fair, I didn't want this. My heart is trying to kill me-- going against my wishes just to prove that I am not, and never will be, in control. You inhabit my heart; no wonder you're unhappy-- trapped in some cold, unfamiliar prison that you can't even see. 

Wasted moments, days, years, eons spent not knowing what I could have had, and losing it. Breathing takes an effort that I don't think I have. 

And why is it that nothing can ever be just easy, good, or comfortable? Every situation comes with strings attached, a laundry list of bullshit to be dealt with and guilt to be endured. How have I survived this long? How did we get here, to this cold and empty place? I have forgotten where I came from. It has ceased to matter. 

All that matters is right now, I am sitting in my (empty) bed, waiting for the sun to rise and morning to begin, so that I can wait for the moon to rise, and then do it all again.

The problem is, every time I post I get some guy/girl on a high horse telling me about addiction like I have no idea that heroin is terribly addicting. I'm happy I picked up from my dboy and this negative nancy over here is commenting on my shit like my 5th grade dare teacher. I understand you want people to be safe but I'm a 26 year old person who has gone through heroin addiction and recovery before, you don't have to tell me that heroin can make me lose my morals.

No one else but an opiate addict is going to virtually pat my back when that homeless guy I see on the corner every day magically comes through with some fire.

I'm in the UK and have been using opiates on and off for nearly 10 years. I've recently found myself unemployed, burned through all of my savings and now finding it difficult to support my habit. I've really cut back, using only ~0.2g heroin a day, with poppy pod tea on top but the amount of that I'm using is getting fucking ridiculous, I'm drinking pints of the stuff to feel anything!

I was just wondering what the situation is with methadone/subutex in the UK. I'm not really looking to quit, just something to take a bit of pressure off financially. Do I need to be referred by a doctor? Would I even qualify as I've reduced my using so much? Are they strict with people using heroin on top of the methadone/subs? Do I need to do shit like group therapy or is it just turn up daily for the meds? How long before you get take-home scripts? My local chemist is also where I get my pins from, would this be a problem? Do you get any choice wrt which meds you get?

I know that's a shit load of questions, I suppose I'm just looking for people who've been through it to walk me through the process. 

Also feel free to share your experiences with methadone/subs, I've heard some real horror stories about quitting the methadone!

This was definitely not a case of the product sitting next to a strong scent and picking up the scent. I've had that before and that was different than this. In every one of those cases, you could smell whatever the product was sitting next to. This was AA scented, as I mentioned already...

I ask him about his job and life, he asks me about my job, life, and addiction. I tell him everything that's been going on, and he relates as usual. He gives me cudos for being clean blah blah blah.

We get on the subject of some of my former oxy connects falling off hard and getting into boy, ruining their lives with poor decisions.

I inform him of a couple of guys that are fast tracking their eventual death via overdose and tell him to let me know the day he gets the call to scoop their lifeless carcass out the bathroom floor or bed. 

He then sends me the death certificate of a guy we all went to school with that was responsible for the deaths of 3 other 16-20 year old kids. His death certificate read death by accidental heroin overdose. Not much of a surprise.

But then my buddy tells me about the dope they found where this kid died. Apparently he was banging ECP. But this wasn't any regular dope... They had the dope tested for his toxicology report and they found something disturbing...

The dope was cut with very dried out dog shit. As in actual D O G S H I T!

I found this absolutely disgusting. He told me that this isn't the first time they found dope cut with dog shit (God knows whatelse could be in it). And apparently this dope is causing raunchy infections in the users.

I just find this shit (no pun intended) disturbing and vile. I know dope is all about money and addiction but damn cutting your dope with dog shit to make more money is just fucked up. If someone can't take the time to find the least harmful cut possible, then they don't need to be dealing. 

Not only is it dangerous and disgusting to bang, but think about snorting this stuff! How nasty. 

I don't know just found this to be fucked up, and get the opinions of heroin users to see how you feel about it. 

Is the high/addiction from heroin so powerful that you are willing to put dog shit in your system? 

Not talking down on anyone either, I'm just curious.",1425110767.0

2xfwiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xfwiu/wtf_my_dope_flew_away/,33,https://redd.it/2xfwiu,OptionalAccountant,Wtf my dope flew away!!!,"so I had dope in a rolling paper, in a blue paper, in a small plastic Baggie. Somehow it got wet through the baggy, and I mean soaked. I was at work at a new part time gig in delivery. I put the two layer, wet blue ball containing over a half g on my air conditioner vent tilted up so the ball wouldn't fall off. I then blasted my heat on full speed. This seemed to be working well to dry out the dope after about 3 deliveries. 

On the 4th, I was driving back from the delivery with my window down when I noticed my blue ball of joy powder was no longer on the vent!!! I have searched everywhere possible in this car and it is nowhere to be found... I have simulated the scenario with small balls of paper of comparable size and weight, but even at high speeds I cannot get anything to fly from the air conditioner vent out the window except a freak ing plastic Walmart bag! I even turned around and checked the last place I delivered to to make sure It didn't fall out. I remember seeing it on the way to that delivery...


So yea I am really frustrated now because there isn't really anywhere the dope could have gone... And yet it's nowhere to be found... I spent way too much time on the job looking for that shit. I am really tired and all I want is a nice shot right now to make my back stop hurting. I drove 6 hours round trip this morning to go get that baggy this morning before work and it was supposed to keep me well through work for 3 days! I just got home and am about to give it a real thorough searching as it pretty much has to be in there!

TL;DR My dope got wet so I put it on my air conditioning vent and plastered it with hot air. After a while it was gone and I cannot find it.",1425106112.0
2xfw68,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xfw68/my_best_friend_died_today/,43,https://redd.it/2xfw68,Gratefulstickers,My best friend died today.,"His name was Danny Gibbs and last night at 2:30am I received a call from a mutual friend. She was screaming and crying ""Danny's dead"" which was confirmed when she put me on the phone with a police officer.  It took them over four hours to pick up his body.  The mutual friend had Danny's body laying there on her floor. He was my best and only true friend.  All my years of being a homeless drug addict and he was always there to listen, get high, and  just generally be my brother.  It was a heroin overdose, she called 911 and administered Narcan twice with no results.  Paramedics performed CPR for forty five minutes.  

He has no family, none. His mother was a drug addict who was killed when he was an.infant.  Never knew father either, he wasn't even on his birth certificate to my knowledge.  He was raised in various foster homes from Brooklyn to Pennsylvania.  His grandmother passed away years ago resulting in zero blood relatives.  I will not let him be buried in potters field.  I'm.still in shock and this is not one of my better attempts at writing but I'm on a phone. Somehow funds are needed to cremate him.  He was a fellow Grateful Dead fan and I wanna make sure some ashes are spread there as he would want that. I will not let him be forgotten as some street addict. He was  an exemplary human being and he deserves a proper send off.  Myself and another friend are taking the reigns here and will be going to ID him.  A memorial is being planned as I was privy to his list wishes, in this line of work as I call it, We'd talk about what we would want when we went.  And because it was always a possibility for us, we planned accordingly.

 I've been given the option that if I leave my mother's house where I've lived the last month and go to the city, I'll not be welcome back.  Her fiance feels strongly that I need to severe all ties to that old life if I wish to succeed. 

Normally I'd call Danny to bitch about situations such as these. His response was usually, ""Dude just consider yourself lucky to have family TO bitch about."" I can't make that call anymore.  That hurts, just like having to call people all night and day about what happened.  I'm numb right now also angry. Angry he's gone and angry I wasn't there.

He was 31 this past November and he's survived by his family, which was us, his close friends.

Miss you Danny

I'm tapering off my Methadone script, and once I get off it I'll be going onto a naloxone (or is it naltraxene?) implant to make sure I stay straight.

The down side to this though, is that I can't drink any more.  
I used to love getting drunk with friends, but now it's like as soon as I finish my 2nd drink, my brain instantly starts up with ""hey man you should go score, it's only round the corner from here, go home early and get fucked uyp"".

I managed to avoid it tonight (first night out drinking in a while), but it wouldn't have taken much more to convince me to leave...

I always noticed back when I was doing about 4-5 30's a day that when I would smoke them, it took wayyyy less to get high. like I could smoke not even a whole 30 and feel good but I had to snort 3 or 4 if I wasn't smoking. now of course I know the high is extremely short. I don't care, I just wanna get high for a little anyways. so since it takes way less to get high when smoking them, you think ill be fine to smoke a 30 after being off the subs for at least 24 hours?

Coin store guy looks at the dime under the magnifying glass, and his eyes go wide. He then tells me that the dime was not only minted in San Francisco, of which only like 12% of dimes that year were, but it had a strike error, meaning it was fucked up when it was made. This made it worth a LOT more, and I ended up walking out of the store with *$335*, all for a dime I got as change one day!
