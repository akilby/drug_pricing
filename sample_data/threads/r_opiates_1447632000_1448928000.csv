New to the forum.
I have pretty bad debilitating pain and me and some advisors are trying to find the right meds and the right doses. I take adderall in the beginning of the day (treats my GAD and Social anxiety disorder). I take 2 20mg of valium and 3mg attivan (super BAD ptsd). I take gabapentin also. I am bound to a wheelchair with a spinal cord injury and actually have bad pain. Adderall helps the pain, like right now writing this post my mind is off the pain but then I will think about it when i talk about it (try to watch tv or go to gym) I am currently on 4 hydrocodone and the person im working with want me to try subutex with my 4 hydrocodone. How would this affect the MU receptors or any mechanisms. I also take baclofen for spasms and wellbutrin for anti depression and serequel and zyprexa for I dont even know. I take the seroquel, zyprexa, attivan and 2/4 of valium.  I'm not depressed but just in pain.  I dose my hydrocodone at 15mg (15,15,10) wait 2-4 hours depending on pain. I dont want the subutex to stop the effect of painkilling effect of hydro. I have been on almost every opiate and this is the lowest Ive been. We tried two weeks at 24mg of subutex. Any input would be great. Beware, I do have a track record for abuse but i'm done chasing any high and just want relief. I'm actually finishing up some rehab stuff. My mind is in the right place. I dispute that sweedish fish are the best candy ;). Thanks in advance.",1447685732.0

I've been using a moderate amount daily for about the last 3 weeks. Say about 60mg a day for that time period of roxi, liquid morphine, hydrocodone and/or tylenol 3. It's been a fun ride, but as I say, I'm down to the last bit of my supply now. 

I'd like advice on the best way to step down dose with what I have left to try and avoid any withdrawals that might be waiting in the wings. I have about 60mg of liquid morphine and also have 4 - 12 mcg fentanyl patches left. 

I've never used fentanyl in any way before except for slapping one on when I first came in to this lovely pile of narcs a couple weeks ago. I'm wondering if I can cut the fentanyl in half? They don't seem liquid filled or anything, just like a small plastic sticker.

I had hives for like 3-6 months once. It was absolutely insane, they don't know what causes them and I had to take benadryl to get them to go away constantly (not massive amounts though). Anyways, I had no idea really how to slam dope back then and it was like my first week doing it by myself. I ended up with a bad histamine reaction and then woke up with super bad hives later that night. Like all over me. Anyways, I went to an allergy doctor and a bunch of different specialists and it eventually went away but I never could figure out the source. I had a lot of stressful things happening at the time: graduating college, relapsing on dope after rehab, best friend dying, a break up after a long relationship. It is possible it could have been stressed induced, but it was like the most insane and scary health problem I have ever had and I have a feeling it had something to do with the dope and the histamine reactions maybe set something off in my body but I have no idea. It got to the point where I could feel when they were coming on because it felt like my skin was flushing so I would take Benadryl immediately and that would pretty much take care of it. But I was just curious if anyone else experienced this? The amount of time was really freaky and the fact that doctors couldn't figure it out was equally scary. I did a lot of dumb shit shooting during that week like trying to hit a vein on my foot because it was big and I was naive and my foot got so fucking swollen it was ridiculous. Haha I also had an overdose around that time, and it really kinda put me off of shooting drugs for a really long while. I smoked a lot of heroin for a long time and would only shoot up occasionally. Anyways i'm just curious if any fellow users experienced something like this? Im thinking it was either the dope was fucked up or my technique with the needle set off a histamine reaction. By the way I wasnt really using after that week, or very rarely. ",1447657664.0

I've been kind of concerned lately about the amount and severity of my histamine reactions. It seems to be the same whether I'm shooting Tar or Powder, but I'm guaranteed the hives/blotches around the injection site, which dosen't really concern me, but what does is the Hives/blotches that run up my arm following my veins, sometimes accompanied by unbroken redness following the main vein up my bicep (not red veins themselves but an inch and a half stripe of red skin following the vein). It's not like a morphine rush that I'm used to, no pins and needles in the face, just itchyyyy arms...

I'm mostly concerned because I read recently that a good number of OD's are caused by anaphylactic shock caused by intense histamine reaction, not respiratory depression. Espically in the case of ""Heroin Only"" OD's. Anaphylactic shock being something I'd like to avoid, I'd like some input on how close my symptoms are putting me to shock, or if this is something I should even be worrying about in the first place. I mean people in the ICU on morphine get straight up red veins emanating from the injection site and they're fine....

TL/DR?

My arms are getting a fucky and red constantly from histamine reactions when I shoot, will this eventually lead me to be gasping for a epipen as I die alone in my apartment or should I just take a benedryl and quit bitching?",1447643150.0

While I was in the hospital they were giving me the usual morphine shots, and noticed that even after 4 in a row, I was still kicking and screaming, so they started giving me dilaudid.

The next day, after surgery, they started giving me two percs at a time. After awhile, they became concerned about the amount of Tylenol I was taking, and told me I couldn't have anymore until the doctor came in an hour from then and figured out a better alternative. I thought, great, but I failed to take into account that doctors are often late.

Well, this guy was 7 hours late to meet with me. This ENTIRE time I'm kicking, screaming, bawling, you name it. My mom is begging nurses to help out and they just continued to tell me to wait.

FINALLY, they get a call from whoever that gives them an update. I receive two 5 mg oxycodone, and to get my pain back under control, a shot of something I can't recall the name of. This shot, however, was administered just to the right of my belly button. Naturally, I'm thinking this isn't gonna do anything, being something I've never heard of and it's not administered via IV. For two minutes I'm waiting for SOME type of relief, when it hit me. A rush unlike any shot of morphine or dilaudid they had given me (and my tolerance was remarkably low at this time). For the first time since I broke my leg I sank back into my bed and smiled as I became wrapped in a warm blanket of intense euphoria.

My question is obviously what this drug could've been. I'm fairly certain it was something I'd never heard of, but it could've been something they had already given me, but administered differently.

TL;DR: Doctors shot me in the belly with what gave me the absolute best and euphoric opiate(?) experience I've ever had before. What are the possibilities that this drug could've been, and why does it work SO WELL without being injected into the veins?",1447641036.0

But maybe I'm just being paranoid? I can't really figure this out, although I guess it might be nothing, so I thought I'd share the story in hopes of getting any feedback, explanations, or personal experiences that match or don't match from you guys.

Apologies in advance that the following is long, but I figure much of the story is needed in order to understand context and get feedback. I've tried to shorten things as much as possible.

Yesterday I went to my local emergency department, after increasing difficulty breathing. I'm chipping right now, been taking exactly the same mg (oxycodone) everyday for weeks now, so I really doubt that would be causing breathing trouble (and alas my chipping dose is much smaller than what I was doing for a good while up until recently... I also haven't changed any of my prescribed medications, so I'm doubtful that there's suddenly some sort of crazy potentiation going on. So it was mysterious. (I don't have asthma or any other respiratory condition.)

I hoped and hoped for it to pass, but to shorten the story, ended up at the ED, by which time I was also experiencing quite bad head and chest pain, maybe because I was hyperventilating away all my co2, but with such pain it's really hard to focus on breathing properly. 

The triage nurse he asked about meds I take and stuff, and then those three questions: do you use alcohol, do you smoke cigarettes, do you use drugs? No, no, no were my answers because discrimination against addicts is alive and well in the medical field (despite the rates of drug abuse among us folk -- and not to judge, I can't complete my shift without opiates either). Nurse asked about pain and I hate those pain numbers because I'm always afraid of being seen as exaggerating and then no longer taken seriously, or low-balling it and ending up with just about as much pain as I started with, but I (truthfully) told the nurse that my head pain was a 8/10 and my chest pain a 6/10.

They took some blood and of course I wanted to know which tests they were running, but it was mostly basic stuff -- CBC, met panel, lithium level. They also wanted a urine sample, but as I had been really focusing on the breathing thing I hadn't had anything to drink that day, no urine for them.

When I finally saw the doctor she did a quick examination, asked me about my history, diagnosed a panic attack -- interesting because I've never had one before (but can I have a prize for having a 9 hour long panic attack?) and said she would order some PO Ativan (although I was in the critical section of the department somehow I was lacking any IV access). In the midst of the doc interviewing me the pain in my head, which sort of came in waves, decreased enough that I could open and focus my eyes without too much added pain, and call me crazy, but I could have sworn catching the doc eyeing my forearms -- why though? So as she was there the pain had gone to like a 7 which is prwtty freaking painful still but it was an improvement, I did give the doc my number evaluation, and pretty soon she left.

Maybe half an hour after the doctor exited another big wave of pain. I tried to curl into a little ball on the gurney while alarms went off around me alerting the nurses' station that my heart was beating rather fast. After a while of this call bell. Stayed in fetal position hoping that maybe the pain would get so bad I would pass out. More time later and a parent goes up to the station asking for help; nurse brings some Ativan. 

At last my breathing slows and I become more attentive, but still pain pain pain. Parent again to talk to nurse at station, who says she will get the doc.

In time the doctor comes in.... with discharge papers and a note for missing work. I don't say a thing, but parents implore for how to manage pain, as at this point I've again returned to ball position on the gurney, doc says take a Tylenol when you get home.

Mostly, I'm kinda mystified as to what happened there. Or, is it nothing, am I making mountains out of molehills? The only explanation I can come up with, in addition to some of the doc's other behaviors (I didn't detail absolutely everything above, this post is hella long enough) is that she mentally diagnosed me as drug addicted (true) and drug-seeking (not true). But if that was her assessment, why didn't she say something to me? And how on earth would she know? 

I know the DEA and my state is kinda freaking about diversion from EDs, but I think that has in turn made some ED docs timid about using pain meds... Eh, it's this whole crazy thing.

Out medical board issued a statement pretty recently saying that a patient in pain, who is also chemically dependent, should not be denied appropriate pain relief. Of course it's easy to say. 

Okay, finally shutting up now.

So two years ago this coming January, I slipped and fell at work and shattered my wrist. This was due to negligence on the management's part, aka too cheap to buy rock salt in the height of a Maine winter. I've had three surgeries on my wrist since then. One to put in a plate and ten screws, one to take that out, and another to kind of clean everything up. My last surgery was January of this year, and I'm still experiencing a ridiculous amount of pain. I'm 21 and will have severe arthritis in this wrist by 25. As it stands now, the pain is enough to interfere with work (IT... Lots of typing) and other day to day activities. The doctor that did the first two surgeries was a bro and prescribed me enough Vics and Percs to actually feel alright. The doctor I have now, the one who did the third surgery, doesn't believe in prescribing opiates to young people. The only thing he would give me is a tiny Tramadol script. Now the tramadol has had no real effect, and doesn't touch the pain. My doctor refuses to believe that I'm in enough pain to warrant something stronger than Tramadol. I've been considering going to a pain management doctor in town, but I'm nervous that they will do the same thing. Essentially what I'm asking is, what is the best way to make sure that I get a script that's actually decent? I started self medicating when I first broke it with dope and blues and have been since, dope obviously being my DOC. So I have a decent tolerance.

Personally, I think a *huge* amount of the damage cause by opiates is directly related to the way our society handles them. This is what I would do:

* First, decriminalize/legalize small amounts of heroin (and other opiates). Jailing addicts isn't helping them.

* Make safe injection sites a common sight in places where there is lots of use, especially among the homeless.

* Prescription heroin for addicts. Completely eliminate any reason to purchase heroin from street dealers. If a physician asses you, and deems you addicted, you can be prescribed a daily (or several times daily, depending) dose of heroin, or other opiate. No chance of adulterants, 100% certainty of the dose. Optimally this should be free. I seriously doubt those costs would exceed what we currently pay in law enforcement to ""address"" the issue.

At this point, there are some experimental prescription heroin programs, but the way they work makes little sense. You have to have failed at attempts to use methadone or other treatment programs several times. They're taking the standpoint that it should be hard to get on prescription heroin, as it is for worst case scenarios only. Why? You can already get dirty street heroin with ease. Step one should be to get them on a clean, safe supply. After that, as they get their lives on track, you can move them on to something more stabilizing like methadone. If that's what they'd prefer. They could also work towards being weaned off.. which is easier to do with shorter acting opiates like heroin than methadone... hydromorphone might be preferable, or perhaps even better, desomorphine (which has gotten a pretty awful rap due to ""krokodil"", but is really just another opiate).

I've been anything stereotypically ""junkie,"" but, using is the only thing that makes one one IMO. I can't fog myself, I was born to live. Been 10 years long with almost constant active addiction, but it's starting to really become a drag on my life. I don't live in a place big enough for ""markets"" really, it's mostly middle manning unless you're bringing it in so its expensive and cut. Almost all the cats I know in town suck ass and have screwed me over knowingly, as well as screwed over my friends and then either bragged about it, or else they flat up denied it even with proof confrontation lol

I'll never meet the kinda guy I need in my life this way either; I'm bad with codependency so another user would end horribly haha. Basically I really fucking need to quit haha

I feel incredible tonight, and hope all of yall out there are at peace- one way or another! <3

However, I haven't found a lot of reports on how 'popular' or strong the drug is. I know it's stronger than Tramadol, but what of the more commonly abused opiates?

I'm proud to say I did change some things in my life for the better, like I moved, and finally transferred from my original college to the college I wanted to be in. I switched from a smaller college in Alabama to Georgia Tech. But I still couldn't kick my habit. I tried several times, but it beat me everytime. And I finally just stopped trying and my addiction got worse because of more depression. Methadone really is no joke when it comes to kicking. I really feel so weak, because I know I have the power and strength to kick. But anyway, I'm not wanting any sympathy, just wanted to vent. Because I don't have anyone who I can express my emotions and expierences when it comes to this subject.

Due to collapsed arm veins and fear of visible tracks, I use my legs to hit. While sitting, I usually use the tops of sides of my thighs, although I also use my calves from time to time. Then there's my stomach and chest, but that's another story.

The problem is there has been a massive build-up of scar tissue directly over my best veins. When I say its bad I'm not kidding - in some spots the diameter of the scar is almost that of a dime. I know this is kinda hard to visualize, so if pictures are needed I guess I could take some.

So anyway... There's a ton of scar tissue over my leg veins, plus lumps from missing, and it's getting to be more and more difficult to get a solid register. I'm tired of trying for an hour, giving up, then IMing my shots out of frustration, so I'm come to you lovely people for advice.

Oh, and, again, as the title says... Does anyone have any words of wisdom for finding leg veins? As the scars build up I'm running out of places to poke myself. I'm a stone's throw away from pokin' and hopin' you know?

I just turned 18, first time i smoked weed was when I was 14, did it maybe once every 6 months up until i was 16 mostly because I didnt really have any friends i hung out with. Today i smoke everyday some times and sometimes only once a week idk idc, I pop molly pretty much every weekend but lately I've been feeling really STRESSED instead of hyped and love when I take MDMA so I'm going to let my serotonin levels replenish for a few months before taking it again. 

Lately I've taken an interest in opiates though, seems really nice and I think I could keep it to maybe once or twice a month since I'm in my last year of high school and will be going to uni after that, and also I have work 2 days per week that I don't want to lose. I don't know where I'm going with this story I just want to hear peoples stories and someone to tell me that I will be fine and not end up as a dope feen idk

Yesterday I got in a minor accident that was 1000% the other person's fault. He was in the right lane stuck behind a broken down vehicle. I was in left lane going speed limit, he tried to merge into my lane when there was no space. I must have been in his blind spot. Regardless, I just got his car insurance/personal info and filed a claim with his car insurance.

This was literally my first accident in 12 years of driving so didn't 100% know what to do. I figured it wasn't a big enough deal to call the police, but maybe I should have just in case he lies to insurance saying it wasn't his fault even though right after he apologized and claimed it was his fault. My car has some minor damage. 

My question, if his insurance does decide to pay for it, do I have to use that $ to fix the car or can I just keep the $? And who decides how much $ is needed to fix the problem, my mechanic? Is there someone who comes out and does an estimate? 

It would be really, really sweet if I get some extra $ if you know what I'm saying lol. Obviously if it is illegal I'll just get the car fixed, but just curious. The car is financed btw. ",1447858078.0

I hate opiates with every ounce of my being. I hate everything they cause. I hate how they steal everyone from me. I hate how no matter how much it consumes my life, I can never get away. Opiates have taken two of my brothers, my father, and my fiancée. I hate them and all the tears they make fall from my face. I hate/love this sub for how it makes me happy and sad at the same time. I get the biggest smiles from here, yet the deepest frowns. 

I met my fiancée when we were both three years old. We did everything together. First day of school, first school dance, homecoming, prom, high school graduation. We were each other's first everything. The first armpit hair he discovered, he called me and told me about it immediately and it made me laugh so hard that he was so proud of it. He was there for everything. I remember his cuddles. We would spend hours, days even, laying on the couch watching shows. I remember his hands on my hips and his face buried in my neck and how he would pull me closer to him in the middle of the night and kiss my forehead. I remember coming home from work and him being at the door and I would drop my bag and run to him, he would pick me up and kiss me and say ""missed you Tink."" I still don't know where he got that nickname, but I don't care either. I remember when he asked me to marry him, and he could barely get the words out because he was crying and that's the first tears I had ever seen from him in the 23 years I had known him. He was so shaky he couldn't put the ring on. I miss imagining my life with him and the babies we would raise. I miss his smile and how he would stick out his tongue when concentrating really hard on something. I miss imagining how amazing of a father he would be. I miss him rubbing my belly and talking to our baby girl about everything, for hours just laying his head there. Even though it was unrealistic, I miss daydreaming about the day he would be clean and sober and we could be so much happier. 

You know what I don't miss, but would take back in a heartbeat if I could have him again holding me in his arms? I don't miss coming home to cigarette burns in the furniture. I don't miss how frustrated he would get in bed after hours of going and him not finishing. He hated that. I don't miss how his arms would get more and more scars, or when I had to take him to the hospital for abscesses and have people there try to tell me all the reasons why I shouldn't love him and ask me whether or not he abused me, or the times I came home to him unconscious and had to drag him into the tub. I don't miss explaining to my mom why he was so ""tired"" all the time, or staying up all night the nights he wouldn't come home or tell me where he was. The nights where I sat and cried hoping he was just alive, that's it. Alive. 

But what could I do? Kick him out and break up with him? So he could then be on the streets doing the same shit? Let him stay with me and ignore his habit? So it could get worse and worse by the day? Give him an ultimatum? So he could choose heroin over me, because we all know that's how this shit works? But of course I chose to let him just do his drugs and I would leave it be. And I came home to him face down on the sofa, right where I left him perfectly awake but nodding before I went to work. He was so purple when I found him. He was so far gone there was no helping. He had been there for hours. And I just fucking left for work not knowing he shot too much and was slowly slipping away. I just fucking left. I had no idea he wasn't okay. He would always sit there and nod. He was always okay. He always was fine when I came home. He always was at the door when I came home and that day he was not. I fucking hate myself. I hate myself more than anything. 

And here I am. A full 9 months pregnant with his baby girl, my due date is today. He wanted a daughter so bad. So, so bad. He never stopped talking about her. She was on his mind 24 hours a day. The longest he went without dope since he started was when I showed him the positive test. He was clean for a whole month. You know what I'm terrified of? Seeing him in her everyday and hating myself. Hating myself for making the choice of just letting him do his drugs and not doing more to make him stop. Hating myself for knowing that one day I will have to explain to her how mommy let daddy just die and she did nothing. Will she hate me? Will she blame me, too? I have no idea. I surely would. 

With all that being said, I love you all. I've never posted here because I really have no place to do so. But I always read threads. You're an amazing bunch of individuals and you're not shitty or failures like everyone probably tries to make you think. I've gotten some of the hardest laughs from this sub and some of the ugliest cries. But like I said, I love you all. I will forever come here because it reminds me so much of him and I never want to forget.

(The weak 8mg pills with tons of APAP, but still better than nothing). 

I've tried combining it with various drugs, including Fioricet (butalbital), weed, tianeptine, Benzedrex & dicyclomine, all of which add their own unique feel to it.  My biggest complaint is that codeine is too dull and sedating for my liking.  It gives me the opiate body high--muscle relaxation, warmth and slowed breathing--but not the mood boost I crave.  I prefer hydrocodone or Percocet, not because they're ""stronger"" but because they feel more euphoric and uplifting.

What can I do to maximize the effects and make codeine feel more like hydrocodone?

Somehow when I first got them after my grandma died, I realized how superior one Panacod (30mg codeine, 500mg paracetamol) was compared to normal painkillers like paracetamol, ibuprofen or aspirin, especially for headache. I also noticed that just one pill gave me an awesome slightly relaxed and euphoric feeling for the whole day. Since then, I have used Panacod pretty much every two weeks at the most, sometimes having longer breaks when I'm out of codeine, longest one being maybe a year. But even if I can ""quit"", I won't, because at least now, I have managed to keep my usage exactly the same as I always have. Only very rarely I have used it more often. I used to use it only if I had a headache, when I kind of had a legitimate ""reason"", but recently, for the last year or so, I have barely had any headache for some reason so I have used it just for relaxation. Though, not more often that two weeks, excluding a month ago when I used it like four times in two weeks because I felt extremely depressed, but now I've been without it for a month because I don't want to waste my precious stash :-D 

I'm not really concerned right now, but I know that every heroin addict has started from somewhere, and none of them wanted to become one in the first place. Neither do I.

I know from all the low quality dope I've shot up in the past that every single day, drug dealers cut their heroin with substances that are water soluble, safe, and inactive. **What are those substances?** What cut is actually in street heroin that makes it take so much to get high but doesn't make you sick?

I used to occasionally dilute it with pure **lactose**, as I heard that's common and safe, but it's not soluble and leaves behind a lot in the spoon. What's worse is that 3 people have started **feeling sick** and very flushed after using dope I cut with lactose. One had to go to the hospital, so I'm never doing that again. 

So I need to use something else to keep people safe, what the fuck to drug dealers use?

EDIT: okay people are getting angrier than I thought, I don't think you're understanding. **I'm not ripping anybody off**, this stuff is just like 4 times more potent than the strongest stuff in this area, and a lot of people are so used to hearing ""this shit is seriously fire, be careful"" they **don't listen**, they just see the 0.05 in front of them and think ""I'm used to shooting triple this much!"" and they do it all and OD. Even if they do listen, I don't want to risk them not believing the extent to which this stuff is more pure and OD. Or confuse it with a different bag of dope and OD. Or risk it making its way to a third party who doesn't know and **they OD**. It's just not safe to put shit that's too much stronger out on the street, why do you think cutting dope with fentanyl is so terrible? Because people die.

The issue here is I have never dealt with heroin, not even with tar which is readily available. I have done some basic research and gained plenty of knowledge through r/opiates, opiophile, drug-forum, erowid etc.  
  
First and foremost, I will be obtaining Narcan for safety precautions. The second issue is I have yet to see the product in person but was given a brief explanation of the color. From my research, I notice powder is generally a combination of the usual *grey,* *tan (light brown)* or a *mixture of both* and slightly varies due to the cutting agents.  
  
What is interesting from his description is instead of the usual colors I have seen posted here and online. He explained it as being pure/raw (I am skeptical when dealers say the word pure), and it is a *very dark brown*. After hearing this, I started to think there may be some truth behind the purity being above average. But like I've stated before, I have yet to see the product.  
  
Anyways, this would be my first time ever SEEING heroin in real life.
  
I am wondering if what he says is true and the product is indeed ""pure/raw."" I am no expert in heroin and it is rare/non-existent in SoCal.

I recently attended a pill injection workshop in Australia, among the people at this workshop, there was a man called Dr. Bruno Raimondo, him and his team are running research into opioid pills such as OxyContin, MSContin and Subutex and the effectiveness of filtering. I managed to obtain a copy of the slides he used at the presentation, although he has not released the formal version (which I will link to when he has) of the research, the slides he has emailed me are sufficient for the information people need to know.


**Too long didn't read:**

Don't heat pills, heating them doesn't cause anymore drug to dissolve then a 5 minute cold soak, 2-3ml of water soaking your finely powdered pill, with a 1ml rinse through your filter (SHOULD be using a wheel filter) will give you the best results.

**Harms of pill injection**

Injecting pills (or anything) can result in contaminants entering your body such as insoluble particles or bacteria and fungi. These things can irritate and inflame tissue and veins, cause infections in skin/muscle (granuloma, abscess). They can also result in local and systemic infection from the bacteria/fungi. 


Insoluble and undissolved particles can cause microcirculation capillaries (5-10um) to become blocked, they clog up in the heart and lungs. Granulomas in the lungs are caused by inflammation which leads to scar tissue (fibrosis). Congmomerate masses lead to restrictive lung disease and pulmonary hypertension. The particles also reach other organs (liver, kidney etc).


**Key particles in pills (OxyContin, MSContin, Subutex)**

http://i.imgur.com/iMr8h.png

**Other insoluble particles included are:**

* Magnesium stearate (5-30um)

* Titanium dioxide (100um clumps) (ms, oxy)


**Other particles that change form in heat are:**

* Stearyl alcohol MP is 59*C (ms, oxy)

* Eudragit RS 30D clumps at >30*C (oxy)


All these particles cause problems in your heart, lungs and other organs, the chemicals that change form in heart are the reasons why pills should NOT be heated, and you will soon find out there is no advantage to heating.


**Why pills shouldn't be heated**

http://i.imgur.com/hvsyT.png

As you can see, of these images under a microscope, heating pill solutions cause enourmous particles to dissolve in the mix. These particles will pass through the filter (wheel or cotton) and recongeal, precipitating out in your filtered mix or veins.

Ok so I shouldn't heat, what about Rollie cigarette filter filtering (or cotton).

http://i.imgur.com/nSWUr.png

For comparison: MSContin rollies reduce particles >5um by 60%.


**What about the drug retained?**

http://i.imgur.com/yojge.png

For subutex 97% of the drug is returned in this process.

Drug is not retained in the filter after this, even if the filter is wet.


Wheel filters (and why they rock!)

Here is the solution of two pills under a microscope before and after wheel filtering

http://i.imgur.com/DDFwZ.png

**But how many particles are removed by the wheel filters?**

http://i.imgur.com/XMv7e.png

But what about drug recovery

http://i.imgur.com/MLOuC.png

For subutex drug recovery is 99%


**Example of differences between filtering types:** 

http://i.imgur.com/FlFwRSR.png?1

1 = No Filtering

2 = Cotton Filtering

3 = Wheel Filtering


**TLDR:** So as you can see, using wheel filters removes all the particles that cause harm (basically), with a rinse of water after first filter, you can retain 95-99% of the drug (better then a cotton/rollie filter), and heating is generally a bad idea that does NOT help at all, and does more harm then good. Heating actually causes more harmful particles to be able to dissolved (heat can cause previously unsoluble particles at room temperature to become soluble, which then precipitate out in your blood stream after cooling. Infact heating can sometimes cause some pills active ingredient to dissolve even less, 5 minutes soaking of a finely crushed pill in room temperature water before filtering then washing the filter 1-2 times is the best way. Wheel filter is obviously best option

Note: Cigarette filters should not be used because they can contain harmful particles, and cotton filters can filter to about 50um, but since anything larger than 5um blocks capillaries they only help a bit.

PS: Before anyone complains that they've seen this before on another forum, yes I posted this on bluelight, opiophile and 420chan.

And then, despite my best efforts, I'll slowly eat the rest, one by one, over the next few weeks. It's inevitable. 

But I don't go looking!! I'm not copping pills or dope on the street. I'm not lying to doctors to get opiates. I'm just taking what comes when it comes. And I dabble with kratom, though less so lately. But I digress.

I got talking to someone here (local, even), who found #4 on a DNM for a ridiculously good price - dope around here is stupid expensive, especially compared with up north. 

I got curious. I poked around. Then it became a mental exercise. Could I, with zero experience with btc, DNM, wallets, pgp, etc, sort out how all this works? So I read, and I looked around, and set up wallets, and I bought btc, and I made accounts. 

Now what? I think I've sorted it all out. How to know for sure, how to test it out? There's only one way.

In the year I've been clean off heroin, I've lost two friends to the shit, I got an 8th once when I was completely fucking wasted, and toiled with that baggie for about 6 hours, but didn't use any of it at all, I decided to flush it, but I was ready to kill myself once I realized what I did. 

It was no surprise, but I've never felt the same since I did when I quit heroin for the last time. This was the first time I went cold turkey, I wasn't about to waste another ten grand on rehab, or fall into the miserable pattern of trying to juggle methadone and suboxone, while sneaking in my doses again, so I dealt with it myself and while I've been successful, I think that made things a lot worse sometimes. 

My life has gotten better to an extent, I do so many things now instead of heroin, like just shit I never did before because I would have rather been in my bedroom, blasted on heroin, or scouring the town for it. I have money, my rent has been on time ever since I quit the shit, something that was beginning to become a problem toward the end of my habit. My friends tell me how much happier I seem now, but I feel like that couldn't be any further from the truth. 

As shitty as it may seem, heroin let me be myself, I could finally relax in my own head after years of diagnoses and prescriptions that only made me feel less comfortable in my own head. Heroin gave me time of internal peace where I created some of my best art, where I felt more profoundly for anything than I ever have. I loved heroin, even seeing the word gets me excited. 

I also loved being an addict, living an entirely selfish life, dedicated to me and my habit, numb to ridiculous human feelings, and things really weren't so bad. I always kept a job while on dope, never hurt anyone else, and I just felt so fucking good, all the time. Romantically, heroin is the most delightful substance to the human race, or at least it was for me, and I still think about it every single day. 

I can't do it anymore, I just can't, I will never touch heroin again, however, it's nice to know there's a place I can talk about loving something so much that very well may be the devil in most people's eyes. 

Stay safe guys. ",1447923815.0

It's not even that it's juvenile and immature and clannish and makes the whole sub look like assholes. It's that it can be downright dangerous. 

On a subreddit like this one, that is *supposed* to be dedicated to harm reduction- not revisiting the cool kids table in the cafeteria in high school and bullying the fat kids and the kids in Special Ed- downvotes are a way to weed out the good advice from the bad or wrong or potentially fatal advice. If I see a comment telling a first time user to bang 200mgs of heroin, I'm going to downvote the hell out of it so when OP sees it, they will know that ***it's bad advice.*** If someone tells another person that rinsing a needle with water will kill Hep C, I will downvote, to let people know that ***it is bad advice.*** Likewise, if I see advice or suggestions that are massively upvoted, then generally it's safe to assume that OP knows what they're talking about. 

So, our safe little system of internal information quality control has now broken down, and it is to the detriment of everyone. This downvoting shit isn't just not funny, it is detrimental to our safety and it makes our entire subreddit look like assholes. All of society already think that junkies are the scum of the earth, and here we are providing them with proof. All they have to do lately is take one look at this sub: the mass downvotes, the harassment, the trolling, the name-calling, the sniping, and we'll have confirmed their beliefs. We are our own worst enemies right now. 

To say nothing of what will happen when SRD gets ahold of recent threads. We **really** do not need that kind of exposure. 

Please, just give this some thought. I love this sub, but it's turning into a pack of high school bullies who just want to burn the school down around everyone's ears. ",1447920166.0
3tepb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3tepb2/would_like_to_share_an_instance/,3,https://redd.it/3tepb2,Sightimes,Would like to share an instance,"So, my preface/disclaimer is that I am one of you

this is an alias to my usual username, which some of you might recognize? Im not as social as some of you are, that is to say some of you know each other really well, i really havent built any relationships of any kind off reddit. Anyways, my DOC is morphine, pill form.

That was just so you know who this is coming from, an opiate addict.

Anyways, I remember either in middle school or in high school, a buddy of mine who started smoking pot was telling us all how pot is not like other drugs, its not habit forming, and most importantly you can lead a normal, functioning life while using marijuana regularly. He supported his claim by referencing his neighbor/friend who was a few years older, and lets say if we were in middle school, dude was in high school, if we were in high school, then the neighbor was in college.

Anyways, this neighbor was really smart, going for a crazy demanding degree, maintained a relatively healthy lifestyle and was still all around pretty cool.

One day, a peer of the neighbor (im going to call the peer mitch and the neighbor kyle) was over kyle's house and they were hanging out, probably smoking bud. And Mitch busted out some heroin, I guess.

Immediately, Kyle told him to fuck off, to get the hell out of his house and that he would never touch that shit. Mitch left. 

Kyle succeeded in all his goals, Mitch OD'ed several times, pretty sure he's still alive, but there were stories of being found in a pool of blood in his toilet and jail time, if i recall correctly.

Why am I posting this here? 

First of all, if you've already downvoted, that's fine, this thread is not for you.

This is for the more mature people who can handle having a possibly dissenting discussion (if it even warrants being called that), or rather, a realistic discussion about the choices we are making in our lives.

So, I am posting this here, because I remember when taking any drugs any time was *not* okay nor was it cool. Im talking post DARE, post high school even for some of you. 

That, most of us, Id wager, *did* have a line we would not cross. Im not going to go into causes of addiction (war on drugs, war in Afghanistan>more opium>easily prescribed drugs>addicted to painkillers, family history, etc). 

I say this because heroin is something I said a million times I would never try. And while I still havent, and I most likely will not, it absolutely does not have the stigma with me it used to. To be frank, the main reasons I havent tried it are:

1) there are people I dont want to lie to, so if they ask me, ill have to want to tell them the truth, and they're the type to never let me live it down
2) im afraid of getting a bad batch. mixed either with fent or some other shit

But having done, im pretty sure ever other opiate short of PST & heroin, I know I'd love it, I know what to expect, and hey, tomato tumatow, right?

Same class of drugs anyway.

However, the discussion at hand is: remember when it wasn't as simple as tomato tumato? And when things had enough meaning in your life for you to uphold them? When your **life** had enough meaning you could say no and you had to uphold your end of the bargain of this thing called life by maintaining yourself, so to speak? So you didn't just ingest chemicals to get high.

Im sure most of you remember this. I know I do. I feel like Im being a bad person, not because of how I treat others, or because I put my drug first....but I literally have become such a sloth of a man and do less and less...that it's almost like using a cheat code at life. It just feels...cheap. and to bring it back to the story I shared, it feels like I went down the wrong path. 

Not saying I could've 100% prevented it, or whatever. All I am saying is, there was a point, for me, where I did have limits and I was conscious enough to act on them. Consequently, I feel I was better off...The road of ""taking whatever it takes to make me well,"" and ""never said Id do drugs but now I do heroin and coke.."" is not you talking...at least, I know I've felt I lost a lot of what I considered myself the older I got, and back then I had my limits, and now I have less and less, and coincidentally there's less of me present. 

Anyways...I hope that made sense.

Like I said, I don't want to offend anyone. This is a *very* fickle community. Very supportive, generous, emotional, compassionate, and that other side of making fun of people, or being extremely mean to people who made bad decisions or maybe dont know as much about certain things...Kind of blows my mind. It's almost like this entire subreddit as a whole is one addict...Fickle.

anyways, if I did, sorry. I am a user. I tried to stop, made it 1 day, and here I am, popped 4 100 mg morphs. I get it. I really do.
i just hope you all know I come with no judgement or weird feelings, only to share something I thought about regarding our addictions. Well, regarding mine that I hope some of you share.

I'm in Canada and we don't get them here.. but to those of you in the US... What is the point of these pills?   For those who don't know, opana is probably the opiate with the absolute worst oral bioavailability.  Its oral BA is 10%... meaning if you were to take 40mg of oxymorphone orally, only 4mg will actually be absorbed/processed.  Obviously doctors aren't prescribing these drugs to patients knowing that they're going to crush and snort/shoot/plug them... so I'm just left wondering... why?

Anyone else ever wonder that or find it odd?  Hydromorphone has pretty bad oral BA as well.  I remember when my brother had surgery the doc prescribed him 2mg dilaudid.  They did NOTHING for the pain, and he had no opiate tolerance whatsoever. Even 4mg did nothing. I had him call the surgeon and he was prescribed percocet instead.  He was rocked off one perc, but I digress..

Can anyone shed some light on this for me?  Maybe I'm missing something obvious but I'm in Canada and have no one else to ask.

I just purchased half-gram of heroin, and set it aside on my altar in a box that serves as potent reminder of reasons not to do it.

I have it there, because while I become physically clean and changed a lot of my mental attitude, I still don't know what all my triggers are, and I am trying to understand how much of my life I need to change. For example, do I drink a beer and all the sudden I'm opening the box? Getting some bad news? etc..

So, let's hear your cynicism, but also your bets. How long before I open that box, and when I open it, do I end up doing it or flushing it?

It's already been one hour, which even that I consider amazing.

Will answer questions about my usage and drug history for you if it helps in your bet.

I'm guessing I will hear a lot of ""You've already relapsed,"" ""Bang that shit,"" ""I wish I had ...,"" etc.. I understand the sentiments, I just need to do this for myself.

Oh, and now that I've been a week without heroin. Today is day one without nicotine. There's an unopened pack of my brand on the altar also.",1447887602.0

A few days later I decide do go cop again. Same thing same batch same dose. Except this time I nod out at the gas station I fixed up at and woke up to an emt shoving narcan up my nose and a cop. Basically my choice was go with the emt in the ambulance to the hospital or go with the cop to jail.

I went the ambulance route cause jails not an option right now. So I get to the hospital in a room talk to a nurse and a doc and chill around in the room for 2 hrs before I ask to leave. They say they wanna monitor me for about 5 hrs but I gotta be to work at 5 so I leave ama. They had put in an order for a nicotine patch for me cause I wanted a smoke and the doc wouldn't let me go outside, but I never got the patch. Just signed the ama papers and walked out and back the 3 miles to my car.

Mind you the emt said I was still breathing but it was ""strenuous"" so tbh I doubt I needed the narcan since I woke up to him putting the bottle up my nostril.

Anyway, my question is, since I didn't wanna use my parents insurance for all this. What am I to expect to have to pay for all this? That is, the 3 mile ambulance ride and the sitting around in the hospital room.

Reasons inside and advice greatly appreciated from you all. (X-Post from r/drugs),"Hello everyone, So here is the backstory: We've been dating since May and I've known her since middle school. We are both students at the same university and are infatuated with each other, however things have gotten very odd over time. First off, I know a lot about drugs and how the majority react to different psychoactives. I am a Psych major graduating this year and plan on going to school for my Psy.D. I have researched many drugs and know about addiction, dependence, and where/how the drug effects an individual. I also am a cannabis user, along with occasional Klonopin use due to recent traumatic events that I endured. 

With my knowledge on these substances, especially those with high potential for abuse, have shown me what I think is an addiction. I have found many gum wrappers laying around (sometimes in half if that means anything), along with being folded in an odd way. I have also found some type of sticky residue on the inside of the wrapper. The weirdest thing I have found was a bobby pin with black residue on it, but it was stuck to the wall behind my toilets tank. It was very hidden and along with it were little pieces of foil on the wall stuck there. When I say little, I mean smaller than a pencil's eraser. Something else I noticed was that my incense were burnt and in random places, almost to track where she was putting little points of whatever it is. Little white, and dark, hard like ""rocks"" have been found, as well as clear shards.. A sticky brown like residue was found in her bathroom and also my room and it was much more pungent than hash/cannabis in general. I also notice a random smell that I can't put a name to. It is almost that of chlorine or bleach but mixed with dirty clothes or something. It is literally a smell I cannot describe.

Other things are the symptoms she has displayed the past couple of months. She will be very upbeat and open, excited, etc when she gets off work but literally 30 min later, she is ready to sleep. She also itches her lower legs constantly and attributes that to a traumatic event she experience when she was younger. This could be true but she literally scratches and has open sores/scabs on her lower legs. Her eyes will sometimes be watery 5-10 min. after leaving the bathroom and she will sneeze/blow her nose A LOT. She says it is her allergies but it is winter damn near where I live so I can't buy it.

With what I have told you all, should I stay with this beautiful girl I love or should I call it quits with her..No one makes me as happy as she has and I mean that, but I have confronted her in a way that was not offensive and she was ""completely offended"". Since then, I have been told ""I don't do drugs"" or ""You're putting things together in your mind and trying to make sense of it"", and ""You broke my heart"" more times than I can count. Is she lying to me in your guys' honest opinion? Are the symptoms and what I found a coincidence? She is my everything, but i can't handle being lied to straight to my face. I've told her on multiple occasions whatever it is will not change anything between us and I meant it. I have done psychedelics (tested LSD and shrooms), take stimulants occasionally (those prescribed, such as vyvanse) and what I have stated above, and she knows it all. I have a sickening gut feeling and I hope it is dead wrong because it is causing major problems between us. 

Thank you to whoever read this all of the way through and thank you to those who give me opinions and advice on this situation. Hope everyone has a great night/day..",1448027634.0

Now I have the worst habit of my life. 60 mgs of done ain't a lot, but I pee dirty prescribed benzos and my place won't let u go above a certain point if u have benzos in ur system no matter what!

Which really sucks cuz the first month I was doing great. I felt great, I was saving money again, coworkers making comments on how well I've been doing lately. All that. Then I miss a Saturday which means two days no done. And I could have powered through it, but I didn't want to.

So here I go out to the city to go pick up, oh and what's this? My dealer is now selling cheap balls of soft. Man I hadn't done cola in prob 10 years. And I'd love to try a speedball, right? Ha, well u guys can figure out the rest.

I'm still in the program but I'm trying to get off the benzos so I can up my dose so I can be manageable again.

I will say this tho, I have never IVed Coke before the other day, and that SHIT IS CRAZY YO! Like for real craziest rush ever. So bad, I'm so mad I tried that lol. 

Anyways just checkin in, hope everyone gets their checks today and can go out there and get something decent. And for those of u not using I applaud u, and those that r sick, I feel ur pain. But you'll hustle yourself something if you really want it haha

One of our dboys, about once a week, pays for our gas to drive him to Chicago, where he's from, so he can hang out with his family and other girlfriend. While were there, he pays for us to stay at a hotel room, nothing nice at all, but it works. He also keeps us high and keeps us fed, just to be able to drive our car around for that night and the following morning til we check out. Sometimes he buys 2 or 3 nights. Either way, it don't matter, were homeless so its nice to have a place to stay sometimes. OK, anyways, onto the point of my post. We checked in around 4. When we first got there, i had to piss. When i flushed the toilet, i heard some weird glass noise come from the tank on the toilet. I pull the lid off the back and bam, brand new never been used nice crack pipe with a new brillo in it. This wasnt no bullshit rose pipe either, this fucker is thick and long. I scooped it out, dried it off good as i could then hid it in my duffle bag since i didnt have any crack to smoke with it. Dboy stops by with food, dope and 5 bucks. This was prolly 10 pm. By 11pm I need a cig. If you've ever been to the chi, almost everyone and some gas stations will sell you two Newport's for a buck. So I walk outside the hotel and there's a black dude smoking a cig. I ask if I can buy a couple, he asks how much money I got. I tell him just a couple bucks, like 2.50$. He says lemme see it. I give it to him, he asks if I smoke hard ""Sure do!"" And proceeds to gimme my 2 cigs plus a 20 bag of hard. Saweet now I can use that pipe. I go upstairs. Blow the bag. Of course now I want more, who can smoke a 20 and be satifised? I grab a really nice pocket knife I had and go to the crack dealers room and ask if hell trade. He said sure but he wants 10$ tomorrow morning before I check out. Whatever. Go back to the room,.blow the other bag. Now I'm fienin. Carpet surfing time. If there's a pipe in the toilet, there's gotta be crack in the room right? Well I'm crawling literally everywhere looking with my girl bitching the whole time. Finally, I see this weird dent on the air conditioner thing. I pry it open and and boom! Gram and a half of some straight butter! I fucking shit you not. Best crack I have ever seen in my entire life. Literally started freaking the fuck out. So me and my girl proceed to blow through almost the gram of it. She's like ""fuck it let's clean the room, maybe there's more hidden."" Sure enough, I'm under the end table next to the bed and find another half gram of hard stuck up under the table top in a crevice. I swear to god this is all true. I have never in my life been this lucky or had this much hard at once. Heroin is my drug of choice by far and I woulda been much happier finding that but shiiiiit can't beat a good blast or 20.

I try to stay away from the needle. But I still do it fro time to time just to ""try it"" even though I have tried it 5 times now I still have never gotten the legendary rush maybe because I have a large habit of snorting like 5 bags at a time and play it safe only shooting 2 at the most but I already digressed. 

.

My main point is I want to be able to smoke my #4 that I get out here in NE USA. Its very good quality dope and I get it for a good price so often I don't mind too much wasting some of it to get a nice good high from smoking it really is kinda different I like it. 

  

My main question is if there is a way to chemically turn heroin HCL (no.4) Into Heroin Base (no.3 the one you smoke). I work in a chemical job so I have access to all different types of chemicals and likely anything needed as long as not controlled. I would normally never steal from work but I am talking about maybe trying something with like a quarter of a grams of I wouldnt need much of whatever chemical probably only a shot glass worth. But I want to know what chemical. Just use any base? Would I go about making crack but rather with dope?. Any help would be great. 

In the past I have smoked number 4 and have had it work with limited success sometimes ill get some trails sometimes just a burned black circle spot that went no where and likely did nothing but decompose the H. 

2 ways I have done recently were these. 1 worked and the other kinda. So Ive been grabbing more raw from my dude as of lately. Normally he only gives out bundles but I got into the system of buying my weekly supply from him at once, So I get my brick (5 Buns or 70 bags, 14 bags to a bun) every Sunday and it normally lasts me until Friday after work then I grab some weekend supplies normally just 2-3 buns and some white or something else fun. 

The first thing I tried was I grab some of the pebbles that are still in the dope he gives me still rocked up hard as fuck from whatever it was originally in or shaped as. These hard pebbles I will then smoke just like I would a jawn or blue or oxy 30 or whatever you may call it. I generally use pebbles about the same size too as a 30. This seems to actually work pretty well whatever it is that makes jawns being able to smoke lets these hard things trail down the foil smoking the same way and clean as shit. I guess just being compressed is what helps 30s and these dope rocks be smoked. 

They other thing I tried was the classic mix caffeine with your dope in order to smoke it. Ill actually tried this before but with no luck really it kinda just makes a mess and doesnt really slide at all anywhere. So this time I went and used a little amount of yayo. Yes I know very wasteful but I followed the same guide as for caffeine which is 1 part caffeine 2 or 3 parts dope. So I only used one bag which was able 60mg so only have to use about 15-20 mg of coke. This seemed to actually work much better than caffeine. Also I seemed to get some effect from the coke which was nice but not sure if it was a mental thing or not. 

But yeah so let me know what you guys think I would love to have some better ways to get to smoke some dope other than using the DNM to get some tar from the west coast. ",1448113932.0
3tov4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3tov4r/sunday_morning_cocktails/,23,https://redd.it/3tov4r,madscientistyo,Sunday morning cocktails,"hey guys,

Just prepped myself for a great lazy Sunday. Starting with ~1.5mg subutex sniffed + 150mg lyrica + 350mg soma + 20mg THC (med grade capsules). This is just getting started, but I only got enough lyrica to try it once or twice, so I wanted to be careful with that. Soma is my favorite but it just destroys me or knocks me out if I take too much, so since I'm starting with lyrica (from posts I searched here it sounds like I might need a lot more to get the effects?). I just didn't want to add too much to my Sunday morning cocktail since I haven't tried lyrica and want to be careful with it. The THC mints are not nearly as strong as I hoped but they're definitely not fake (I can taste it and smell it) and taking a few will be a great buzz. 

One thing I like is that, despite keeping my doses low, I get a little taste of everything. Plus, things like lyrica and soma are only borderline recreational (depends who you ask), but most agree they are potentiators. It will be interesting to see how the soma and lyrica combo feels.

Anyway, what's your Sunday morning cocktail?",1448112580.0

Then there's me.","For the past couple years I've been storing this cello on my house for a friend of a friend, call her ""C"". I don't even have C's phone or email. She was living in a storage unit, and needed a safe, secure place to store it when she moved in to a tiny room in her son's house. 

Back in June I was broke. Hung over. Dope sick. I think we all know where this is going 

The pawn man didn't even think he would be able to sell it, and gave me just a few hundred for it.i promised him I would get if back, no question. 

I was never able to gather up the few hundred plus added fees. 

But every time I go past the own shop, there's the cello, so I tell myself as soon ai have it, I'm gong to rescue the cello. 

Last week I happen to notice the price of the cello dropped. To $375, significantly less than I got for it. 

So earlier this week I got $400 together and got my friend to go in, to buy it. 

She called me while I waited in the car.  ""Did it come with a real case? This car looks like is not a real cello case. ""

I go in. 

Not only is it not a real cello case, but it's not my cello. And on closer inspection it's a piece of shit, not C's nice fancy one. 

""Is this your only cello? "" I ask the pawn shop checker. 

""Yes, "" she says. 

I go white. Panicking,  I pull out my stub.

""What about this one? "" my voice shakes. 

""Oh, we sold that a couple weeks ago."" 

I'm fucked. I don't know how to explain to my friend that ive lost C's cello. I've looked online, I've called dozens of music stores and pawn shops with no luck. 

Im seeing my friend Monday night. I don't know what will happen then, but I believe  this is a friendship-ending event. ",1448107731.0

I like my  ""real"" opiates (oxy, u4 etc) , been dry bout 2 1/2 weeks or so fucking hell a nigga needs to get something tonight.  Back  in the day a cracka used to use about 1.5 lbs of PST to get a good high.

Two days made 2 lbs of PST (same source, always been consistent quality wise).  BTW this was like 2.5 weeks since hitting any actually nice opiate (think pharma shit, and my fav u47).  And I mean I did feel the 2lbs tea. But nose got a lil itchy, lil mood uplift, but aint no nod thats for sure.  1.5  lbs used to get me where i wanted to be.  

Anyways saved my 2nd wash of thsoe 2 lbs for next day at work.  Small mood lift, thats all.

Anyways hit my neighbourhood friendly drug dealer up for some good shit (oxy, dilly, heroineven tho he donit fuck with that shit but could probs find some) .  No luck eh, but got some xannies, never hit benzos in my life. said fk it and buy 3x2mg bars. 

Basically, smoked some weed, took 1mg xan chugged around a 2/3rds of a 1.8 lb PST wash, smoekd 2 more bowls of weed, popped another 1mg of xan.  

Reason I'm doin this is cause i heard benzos + opiates potentiate the fuck outta each other. Sp hoppefully 2mg of xan but that small amount of pst will work nice and syntergestically help me catch a nice nod/ opiate high.

Thoughts? or is this to dangerous?  I should start feeling the PST in a 1.5 hrs tops (takes 3 normally for it to hit)..

Honestly thinking of doing a second wash and slamming that PST too.

Also i'm doing this with a buddy - hes doing what i'M DOINGF  but at about a third regarsding how muc pst hes consuming since hes not qutie the opiate connoisseur i am.

also game plan if one of us ""falls out"" is basically slapping and cold shower.   Any got no narcon lol.

A close friend of mine very recently found out she is pregnant. While that is exciting and all she is also a daily IV heroin user. She asked me if I read about the best way to quit and get through withdraw while pregnant here on reddit ever. I can't think I have ever seen anything specifically about this. 

My question is are the standard withdraw tricks safe to do still? Things like lope and a fast suboxone taper ok to recommend to her? She did recently quit with about 4 to 6 8mg zubsolv over three days about two months ago. I would think she would know what works best for her by now, but I guess the whole having a parasite living in you makes you wonder if there is some other way to do this. 

They estimate she is seven weeks pregnant. They will know a more specific time once she has an ultrasound. I'd guess she does 0.5 or less IV daily. She has had a habit for maybe six years now and has only quit four times for no longer than a week each time.

Any advice that you think might make this easier and also safer for her to quit will be greatly appreciated. She is determined to quit. Now that the initial surprise of finding out her life is about to dramatically change she wants to get this done as soon as possible to get it out of the way and move on. Think good thoughts for her over the next mine months too please. She is a great girl and I really want the best for her.

Thanks everyone.",1448085054.0

I'm not getting any younger and all I know is pleasure from relief. All I know is through the eyes like black holes drawing me in, and the tantalizing smiles with secrets held right beneath the tip of the tongue. Through the words that slither around me like the snake offering Eve the apple. And I am naive enough to bite every time. All I've done is disappoint. Life is a mess. But here I am, cleanest I've been in years, and these are always the points where life is always it's shittiest. No ambition. Well there's rehab, if you could call that ""ambition"". And I'm mostly going there just so I can not think for a while. 14 days is in no way long enough, but that's as long as I can stay. Fully-medicated in there, I will probably be more high than I am right now. They also have acupuncture, so I'm told. That sounds absolutely horrific while sick, but you know, Obama really did get somethings right. A lot of things wrong, but you have to give the dude credit where credit is due...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I had just turned 17 when I discovered the bittersweet taste of black tar heroin. The Boy was smoking it from under a comforter in the Tenderloin. I had no idea what it was. He was trying to protect my innocence. And so was I. I was waiting for him to ask me to try it. He had to make the first step. I can feel the butterflies enter my stomach even now, as I think about that short week in San Fransisco. The week that changed my life for ever. My way of thinking, even the books I read. My goals, my aspirations. They all turned into one thing. It wasn't so much how I felt from the drug, but how I felt from the City. The process. On that first day I had learned numerous things. I learned how to cold cop. I learned about miracles. I learned how to make opium butterflies on Reynold's Wrap foil. I learned how to get in debt. America is a wonderland.

We walked through the streets following a crusty homeless man, after opening a shady bank account at Bank of America. He was outside, picking up change from the fountain when we saw him. ""Hey, do you know where to get any black?"" The Boy shouted in a whisper, grabbing his attention quickly. 

""Sure I do, follow me,"" he said it with such confidence. Turns out he had no idea. We followed him block after dingy block as he farted and belched his way through a multitude of ""Chiva? Chiva? Chiva?"" 

""Aw, come on man! I could have done this! I thought you knew where you were going!"" The boy complained and shook his head. I stared at him in awe. 

None of the boys in high school were like him. He was different from the beginning. 18, but already graduated. Side-burns that were too long and beautiful dark blue eyes. Skinny, because of his neglect to feed himself. He offered a wealth of knowledge and maturity that no one else my age offered. He wasn't afraid to share his feelings or call me beautiful. And I fell head over heels in love him, after only going out with him on a whim. Lost my virginity, but he played the guitar. *And* was the assistant manager of a Gamestop. That first night going back to his place, *his* place (well the room he rented..), I looked into a cave of the depressed and oppressed. The dark and moody and somehow charming. Charming through the filth, the girls panties he shyly kicked into a corner, the bag of stale tortilla chips, and the insulin syringe. All of them layed out on the floor. He didn't notice the last item until I pointed it out, and then promptly swiped it out of view. ""I warned you that this place was a mess."" He shrugged his shoulders, but I was only more intrigued. Who was he? He was a mystery as well as an open book. An enigma that I must solve. He chained smoked. Most of the people I knew didn't even know how to inhale, including me. He warned me before this that he was a drug addict. I just didn't know what kind. I thought he did speed like the only other druggies I had known before him, but I was wrong. He hated the stuff. His was a much different beast, with a much different appetite. 

He was clean when I met him, however (well, *basically*). And I took everything in stride. Even when I found out that he actually had a girlfriend in Las Vegas. He said he wasn't *really* with her. That he was just helping her with a place to stay while she kicked. I was heart broken, but I believed him. But that's not what's important right now.

""I do! I just...the normal guy's not here, okay?"" The high-grating sound of a man's voice caught in a lie, brought me out of my reverie. 

""Forget this. Let's go back...I have a little still anyway,"" the Boy muttered. And I followed him blindly. Watching his every move closely, how he walked with confidence, eyes straight ahead. And I remembered that word from that moment on, *Chiva*. I mentally took notes. The city gripped at my heart. The stench, the people who stared blankly from the sidewalks as we walked by. I was in love in more than one way. I had never done anything like this in my life. It was so vastly different from the suburban life that I was used to that I became star struck. Later on that day I felt as if I were struck by stars.

""You know..."" the boy started to speak, while holding his breath deeply. He didn't have the blanket covering him this time. ""You know, you can try some...if you want.""

This was it. The moment I had been waiting for, but never knew before now. I had never even smoked weed before. Hell, I'd never even drank. 

""Sure,"" I responded quickly before he changed his mind. 

""Here take this."" He passed me the rolled up dollar bill and my hand shook as I placed it in my mouth. ""Now breath in fast, so you can catch the smoke. Here, I'll light it for you."" 

He held the foil in his hand beneath my mouth, lighter ready. ""Just tell me when.""

""Okay, I'm ready,"" I responded. His face was illuminated as the foil began to sizzle beneath my gaze. I leaned forward and sucked in hard. I coughed, failing miserably. 

I took a few more failed hits, and began to grow dizzy. I still had no idea the over-whelming power that heroin could have, but I felt good. We stumbled outside the motel and into the street. We had been staying in Oakland. The city was too expensive, and the motel actually had a bathroom unlike the hostels.

""It's so bitter. I thought would taste like barbecue..."" I smiled up at him, innocently.

The Boy stifled a laugh and said, ""You get used to it.""



These days, I'm sure you can get used to anything.

I thought they were a bunk batch so I gave one to my brother to shoot and he was high as a kite. It made me realize my tolerance is probably at its highest it can be for snorting. 

I've decided to either try shooting or take a tolerance break. I can't really stop everything since I have a busy few weeks of work coming up. I do have methadone I can take from an old script. 10mgs. 

Would 20-30mg of done a day help fend off withdrawals while maybe lessening my tolerance? Or woudl I have to stop completely for my tolerance to go down.

This really sucks, I don't want to advance to shooting, but I don't have the $ to afford pills (my true favorite), and snorting sucks for me right now so IDK what to do.

Got clean and over the past 3 years I worked myself back up to the level I was at before I started using. But I've never been able to forget how good opiates made me feel.

I'm sort of a successful chipper already.  I will smoke (never IV) #3 heroin or tar for about 3 weeks straight, go through withdrawal, which I can handle ok as long as I have the worst day to just lay around and plenty of loperamide and kratom.  But the depression afterwards is what kills me. I get really emotional and just plain sad, dead inside, zero motivation, etc.  That's to be expected of course.  PAWs.  Then I go a couple months clean and the depression is there for at LEAST the first clean month.  So ALMOST 1 month on the stuff daily, then 2 months off, the middle month being the bad one.  That has been my schedule for a year now.

What I want to know is if I just use for *one night* (maybe 2) each weekend, will I feel that horrible depression the rest of the week?  I can handle cravings, I just don't want to be a weepy blob when I'm not using.  I figure once a week for years and then suddenly stopping altogether I'd probably get the depression after a week delay or so.  Sounds about right?  

What if I just did it once a week for several months?  Then went 6 clean? I'd just like to get a nice high on occasion, like my weekend, and deal with negative results as little as possible (heh, I know, don't we all?).  

I've been clean 2 months now, and I may just give it up for good because I don't want to handle the depression in between anymore.  Again, I can cope with the withdrawals.  It's just the fucking PAWs.

Hope you are doing well today, either high or not sick! I'm on a sub taper off of dope and finally the psychological wd that hits hard through the sub is fading. Beautiful weather and a bit of meditation have started my day off right.


Anywayyy, I can get really good gunpowder, and not having jumped to the needle (thank god, it's be the end of me), my ROA is using an oral syringe to shoot tiny amounts of Monkey water up my nose. For those who don't know, monkey water is tar in solution. I was using tap water, trying to only use a few drops of water per dose. I don't boil the water or anything, just drop it on some tar and stir till the tar is dissolved. Then I lay on a bed/chair with my head hanging over the edge and shoot it in gradually to avoid the intense burning that doing it in one big squirt brings. Having my head upside down prevents any of the monkey water to be lost dripping down my throat. I wait ~5 minutes then get up, by which time the monkey water has dried/won't drip. This has worked very effectively, but my nose at the end of my last binge started to suffer. I got 2 sinus infections in 3 weeks. The first was before I was binging on h. I went to a show and did coke, and woke up completely congested and infected. The second was 2.5 weeks later, I did coke over the course of the night, as well as h and molly and focalin. Surprise surprise, wake up and deja vu. 


So I can't do coke anymore (at least up the schnozz) because of that. I'm not about to get a third sinus infection... I was blowing my nose a lot and towards the end of my last h binge blood was coming out every time. My left nostril still has a raw spot I think on my septum near the opening of my nose, and it hurts when I move my nose and feels almost like something is stuck in there. Its gotten a little better in the week I've been off h, but is still there and not going away. Have I done permanent damage? I've only done monkey water maybe 50 days of my life, and very very rarely snort other drugs. Does monkey water degrade your septum really fast? Are there other hazards that I should be wary of like infection or brain eating ameobas?

Yesterday I was barely held together by lope and kratom but by the end of the day I felt like shit cold sweating emotionless. Today I woke up, took a 3rd of a sub. Waited 2 hours and took another 3rd about 20 mins ago. I feel pretty normal right now just a bit tired. My plan is to keep the subs for emergencies and to hold together for work. Tapering with the subs I know will take a while but just feeling like I'm able to get something done today is good for me. 

I'll keep you guys updated and I can't believe the overwhelming support with messages and stuff from you guys. Thanks so much. Will edit later today.

edit: took 8mg of the sub over the course of about 4 hours. feeling pretty good. good enough to move shit around the house and not be depressed as hell. but, in the back of my mind I'm still worried that this is just another addiction...

I've never had a connection here, and it's a fair travel to get to the city, but I was out drinking tonight and seen a homeless dude out begging at 1am, dropped some coins in his tub and walked on.

Came to realise later that he could maybe help out, went back and chatted, dropped some hints. Found out he doesn't do dope, only valium, but knows the hookups. Said he couldn't get anything at this time, but if I get him during the day he'd help out. Told me where his spot is and to just ask another busker I actually happen to know if he's about if he's not there.

Now what I'm wondering is, what's the odds of it working out? I figure if he wanted to rip me off he'd have done it on the spot there and then, but of course I could be wrong. Told him I'd buy him some Valium if he helped me out.

they dont know about opiates. they know i like drugs lol. but not the opiates.... the stigma is simply too strong for them to be able to handle it rationally but i wish i could tell them because things would make so much more sense in their minds as to why im the way i am (or, maybe they'd better understand why i would even put opiates up my face). but, for now, we still all pretend like its just weed and maybe some acid or shroomies occasionally

who's bored tonight? i wish i had a social life, but im also glad i dont simultaneously. fortunately twin peaks is perfect for binge watching lmao

oh, and, someone who i may or may not have met on a certain place on the internet, that lots of us frequent (and maybe even be there now), ripped me off for $120 like 3 months ago and has now quit even responding to my calls and texts. i need that money - not even for drugs, but for real life things. just goes to show that letting a junkie borrow money, no matter how much you trust them, is a gigantic gamble. im not mad.... but, i do wish i hadnt believed that he would pay me back

I always eat a couple of tums and then eat my percocets, 30 minutes later i pop my codeine. I usually stick to 30mg of codeine per 2.5 of oxy. You don't need much due to the synergy.

The best part is, codeine is primarily metabolized by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Oxycodone (~95% of it at least) is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. 

This means that your body will process both of them far better than taking two opiates that work on the same enzyme.

It's a combo worth a shot. Enjoy.

I ended up relapsing because my parents kept accusing me of it, so you know how it goes.  They think I'm using, so why not use? I luckily stopped myself after a few days and a few hundred dollars later. 

How am I doing now? Alright.. Got my trazadone back so i'll hopefully be able to fix this god awful sleeping schedule, and also got prescribed another medication that's not traditionally used for anxiety but is used in some cases.  Hopefully I'll be able to get Klonopin at my next session with him, as I have a history of heart disease in my family and while my heart is healthy now ( my cholesterol is normal levels everything Gucci) .  Kpins are the only benzo I can not abuse (like Xanax) but actually works ( Valium has no effect on me) I mean yeah there's ativan and I'm sure a bunch of others, but my doc said kpins would be his recommendation if this doesn't do the trick.  

Anyways, school is almost over.  I missed a test in class but FINALLY got my drivers license (i'll be turning 20 very soon).  Getting that was the last ""step"" on my road to becoming a normal person again.  Get a shitty job i hate, *check* , Start and continue community college *check* , and now get drivers license and car *check* 

So right now things are looking up I suppose, but when you feel you're at the top, you can only go lower, and when you're at the bottom you can only climb higher.  It's the balance of life.  I'm gonna take the winter semester off (its like a 6 week class semester and 2 or 3 hour classes every weekday fuck that) and plus I need a break.  

Overall, When you feel like nothing can get worse (which I felt while detoxing obviously, adding more apathy and desire to die to already overwhelming depression) but for once, things got better.  And they will get better, if you give them time.  **PLEASE** do not comment a bunch about the whole desire to die thing.  I'm not suicidal, I don't have a plan, and I want to live.  So that covers that.

I just wanted to make this post for those perhaps in my position, looking for a light at the end of the tunnel.  It WILL get better, I promise you.  Using will NEVER fix any problem in your life besides the way you feel, and that's temporary and that's the reason why we're all in this mess, cause that feeling we felt, was the only thing that ever made me (us?) alive.  Stay safe guys, stay smart.  I love all of you, life is precious, cherish it.  People are shitty, but life is beautiful, and I'm working on separating the two.   This community is a great place, and people like /u/traceyh415 give me hope that there are still good people in this world.

3tpiw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3tpiw2/day_3_depression/,30,https://redd.it/3tpiw2,benzopiate,Day 3. Depression,"For those of you who have been following my story.. this is day 3. I woke up depressed this morning, very depressed. I still am. I took 8mg sub about 2 hours ago and I'm still hoping that it's kicking in and gonna make me feel better. The physical symptoms are not so bad, clammy hands and sweats. (Last night cold sweating really really bad.), but the mental strain is so difficult. 

I'm trying to take my mind off of things and relax but it's so hard. I have a Xanax addiction as well which I'm also trying to taper. Man... I wish I could just go back to being a weekend warrior and enjoy a few percs.. but I know that will never happen. 

I got a question for you guys... I was on fent analogs for a year. I lot. AF, then BF. All day, every day (you have to). ... how long is PAWS going to last? Is my extreme tolerance ever going to go back to baseline? (I took 300mg of oxy when I was sick 6 months ago without any BF and it didn't even touch me). 

I hope this depression subsides because to be honest, I'd rather physically feel like shit than mentally.... also,... I have this sub taper in the back of my mind. I have to be strong and disciplined with it. I think I'll drop down to 4mg tomorrow and see how I feel and go from there. I start a new job Monday as you guys know, and I'm getting more and more nervous for it. I have a feeling I'm going to hate it..

Anyway, I hope you all are having a great day. I'll update later, and again, thanks for the support guys. Really. It's incredible. I feel like this is one of the only outlets that I have to really ask for advice or tell my story or hear what I need to hear. so thank you for that brothers. I'll check back in a while... 

Edit 1: 1pm, feeling a little better. busted a nut for the first time in a long time.. haven't had a sex drive in a long time and it just came over me. felt amazing, better than nice shot even. I'm glad that fent didn't fuck my dick up for good lol. I'm feeling alright now... feeling like I'm wasting the day by watching TV though.. I don't know what to do... I can't thank you all enough for the support you have given me, really. You guys are giving me so much strength to keep going, the support is really awesome. Hope  you're all doing well... I just wish there was a quick cure for this depression (besides bustin a nut which only helps for a bit hahah). I think I'm going to drop down to 4mg of sub tomorrow and see how I feel. Then go from there. I want to taper off the suboxone as quick as possible and smoothly as possible.

edit2: been laying in bed all day watching mind-numbing TV. going to drop down to 4mg of subox tomorrow. but I was thinking about 4mg tonight to help me sleep with the fucking cold sweats (I get so bad) and see how I feel in the morning... I'm hanging in there, but I am worried about the depression and emotional toll of PAWS. Not to mention my benzo addiction.. but hey, one addiction at a time right? and right now I'm taking enough Xanax and klonopin to at least make me not anxious.. but it also makes me rather emotionless.. I just wish things didn't take so long to happen.. day three feels like week 3. Part of me already thinks I can start chipping. pfffff. fuck that. don't worry I won't let that happen. I'm gonna stay strong, and all you brothers and sisters can do it with me, together. that is, if you want. I am floored with the responses and messages of encouragement and support. Thank you guys so much. I will probably update later tonight when it's 10pm and I'm dripping frozen sweat...  ",1448124826.0

For those of you following my story, you know  I have just moved into a new house a week ago,  got fired 6 days ago, got a new job the next day, which I'm starting today, and I'm also on day 5, coming off a year long habit of HEAVY fent analog use. Used H to step down from the fent for a few days, now I'm using 2mg of sub (started the first day with 12mg, dropped quick, this is day 4 on sub). I took 2mg alpra [Xanax] and 2mg clonazepam to get me through hopefully today and hold my anxiety together. I am about to take 2mg of sub for the same reason and take 2mg with me just in case but hopefully not need it. I'm feeling worried, anxious, I dunno about this job, I hope it doesn't suck. I'm freezing, but I just gotta get my blood going a bit since I just woke up... fuck I hope this goes ok. I'm just gonna put on a fake smile and act happy and everything will be ok, everybody likes a happy person and they're not going to expect me to know everything on day 1, I know... but I just don't know about the job in general so I hope I don't hate it too much.. and I hope that it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy thinking that I'm going to hate it... hope you guys have a good day and are doing well... I'll check back in later today with an update. Thanks again for all the support friends, helps a lot

Edit 1: WOW! Thanks everybody for so many kind words! I actually had a great first day, it went really well. Learned a lot, forgot a lot. It'll take time of course to learn everything. It's a supervising job at a restaurant, today I was cooking, Wednesday I'll be hosting, and learning every aspect of the place. I took the 2mg sub this morning and still feel good. Hopefully it stays this way for the rest of the night, if I have to, I'll take 1mg maybe tonight to stop the cold sweats to sleep a bit. I want to get off the subs ASAP, but I still have some on hand for cravings in the future. I just took 2mg alprazolam [Xanax] cause I was getting pretty anxious on the drive home, probably unnecessary but that's a whole nother addiction I gotta deal with later. Feeling positive and going to find something productive to do with the rest of my day hopefully and stay out of w/d hopefully too. I'm still thinking about the bills and the new house and everything which is making me worry in the back of my mind. It's just so much at once. Off old drugs, new house, fired from old job, starting new job, new bills, so many bills, ughh.... I'm staying strong though, and you guys help a lot. I'll check back later tonight, and again, thanks so much for all the support. The support you all have given me on this journey is incredible.

Edit 2: 7:12pm... Still haven't taken anymore sub today, just the 2mg this morning. I'm getting pretty intense cravings right now and am feeling like I want to cry... it feels like... a friend is no longer with me ya know? It was always something to turn to. It really feels like I have lost a friend that has been by my side for so long... I don't want to take anymore subs because I am afraid of the w/d from them but I might have to take 1mg to stop the cravings, I'm also beginning to cold sweat quite a bit right now. Whenever I come home to this empty house it's the hardest. I was just out and bought a microwave, and drove around a while to get some other things for the house to stay occupied. I was lifting earlier as well to get some endorphins and blood running. I have to get back to my old workout routine. but right now I just feel like tearing up in the corner because my ""friend"" is gone.. but I know that's weak, and I know that this ""friend"" made me lose my job, and almost the love of my life and more. I have come so far and stayed so strong I have to keep fighting. It just feels like I'm barely hanging on by a thread about to break down at any minute... Just took 1mg of sub. I really hope I wake up feeling better and not needing any subs. I just don't want to feel like I'm about to lose it and tear up... this is so hard right now...

Edit 3: 8:30pm Maybe the 1mg sub has me feeling better, maybe it's the music. I have a habit of sitting in this big house alone, with no music because I'm upstairs and can't hear what's going on downstairs (if somebody is home, etc.). Once I get the living room system set up it'll be better, but for now a little music in my room is nice. That's one of the reasons I love driving so much is cause the music just keeps my mind off things and plus driving my car is really fun (5-speed civic, lowered, custom exhaust, two 12"" subs in the trunk) so it's nice to just cruise and bump some westside connection or whatever. but the point is I'm feeling better... at least a little.

Next day they call the police and file a police report. They claim they also rummaged through the car and that their scripts were in the center console. This also goes on the police report. They then call the doctors office and explain the situation. I guess everyone bought it cause they go in on Tuesday for all new scripts the doc just said they need to bring in the police report.

I didn't have my Narcan with me, we scored away from home while on a vacation. A series of dumb things led to this ... the stuff was stronger than we were used to, he'd been drinking, and he prepped a shot that he knew would hit hard. I hadn't done anything yet that day. He went from talking to me and telling me not to worry to leaning on the sink to collapsed on the floor and blue in less than a minute. He wasn't breathing and his heart rate was weak and fading. I did CPR until the medics arrived. Two doses of Narcan and he was breathing. Three more until he was really conscious and communicating again. He's in the hospital now, six hours from home, with aspiration pneumonia from vomiting during the whole process. He will be ok. 

I took a CPR course two months ago and got certified. I don't know how he'd be now if I hadn't. Please consider taking the Red Cross class if you're around anyone who may need it. 

Please be careful out there. I can't stop seeing his face, lips purple and eyes rolled back. I can't stop remembering the details. I yelled at him while I did chest compressions, shouting that I didn't want to lose him to an OD on the floor of a motel room. I'm so glad he's alive, and that was the worst moment of my life, thinking I'd lose my companion.

It started when I had a surgery and was prescribed t3's, liked the way they made me feel but was a bit young to grasp what these drugs really were. Fast forward to my freshman year of high school and I started smoking weed really heavily. Really enjoyed the feeling of smoking at that time, and it led me to try other drugs. At that age I was also fucking around with DXM and other OTC medicines. It was around this time I found a full bottle of 5mg oxycodone hcl pills and took those for a bit until I ran out. Never really realized the potential for addiction, added it to my vault of drug experiences and moved forward. A few other times in high school I found pills that I abused in my parents' cabinet (the worst being oxys from 1991 from my older brother's c-section). This past summer I came into a significant amount of hydros and vicodin, and was also introduced to xanax and other RC benzos like etizolam. Again, I took them until I ran out, not really experiencing any urge to use after they were gone. Fast forward to now, I hadn't used any opiates since June, but I remember reading about poppy seed tea online a few years back. I look it up again, spend days reading recipes, and decide I'm going to try it. I find a store near me that sells seeds in bulk for 6$ a pound, go home, make the tea and really enjoy it. It led me to a few realizations though. It made me realize opiates are my favorite feeling of any drug I've ever used. It's such a nice break from the paranoid anxious feeling of smoking weed. In the past I have used opiates for small periods of time without wanting to come back, but the ease of buying the seeds at the store is another story, and it worries me. I made four batches of tea this week alone, and I continually have the urge to use. I have never been physically addicted to any drug and I would really like to keep this under control. I was wondering what methods you might have for keeping cravings under control, and if you think it is possible to use poppy seed tea from time to time without spiraling into addiction? I'd also like to hear your stories of how this phase of your use developed over time.

TLDR: Really like poppy seed tea, want to know advice on how to use responsibly. Would also like to hear your stories of when you first got into opiates.",1448227559.0

In all my years of doing dope, I have NEVER come across gray shit.

Has anyone ever had gray heroin? When its in the rig, its super dark (basically black), so can be a bit tricky to register the shot.

I did a rather small anount (maybe .2) to see how good it is, and its some fire. My concern is doing too much so that I get a good nod, but end up ODing.

So if you have done gray heroin, do you know what its cut with to make it this color (my guess is possibly fent, but that doesn't seem cost efficient) and not the usual brown/white that powder comes in?


Edit: Thanks for feedback everyone, this shit is some fire and glad others have good experiences with the gray in the past",1448227507.0

Feeling Blank,"I woke up at like 7:45 this morning, popped 2mg clonazepam, and 1mg alprazolam and went back to bed. It's 10:10 now and I woke up like 15 mins ago and I don't really know how I feel. I took 4mg of sub last night at 6:15 so that I wouldn't be trying to sleep while sweating ice, but I woke up sweating ice. However, now that I have gotten out of bed, it seems to have subsided... for now. I am going to try and play the day as long as I can without taking any sub, and probably take 4mg tonight which makes mg a day, then I'll drop to 2, then maybe lower before I take the fall..hopefully. This is only my 3rd day on subs (when I take one), and I want to get off as quickly as possible so I don't w/d from them more than I have to. I just want it to smoothen my opiate w/d and not have me transition to my train going the other direction. I feel rather dull... emotionless this morning. Unmotivated. But the girls parents are coming over to help with our new house (we moved in 9 days ago) so I'll have to put a fake smile on and act motivated and shit... that goes for tomorrow too. I start my new job tomorrow at 8am. I'm worried about it, but not to the point of losing it or anything. I know they wont expect me to perform perfect on the first day so I'll just learn as I go and my plan is to put on that fake smile and be a happy person because everybody likes to be around a happy person, just for the duration of my shift, then I can go back to being an opiate w/ding, sub taking, benzo addicted zombie with little emotion. I'll check back later. Thanks again for all the support friends. I don't even know if I could be doing this if it weren't for the support I get here. (I probably could, it would just suck more). .I mean, you guys really give me a lot of strength, and great advice. So thanks so much for that and have a great day/be safe

Ninja Edit 1: same time, I just want to say, another reason you guys help so much is because I get to live vicariously through you all getting high and imagine it myself. I also forgot to say my sex drive is actually coming back and in full force if you know what I mean ha. So I'm really glad no permanent damage done there... I haven't woken up with a raging hard-on for a while before this morning. Hopefully my brain continues to re-wire everything as fast as possible so I can jump off this sub wagon before it gets out of my hands. [as you can see it's always in the back of my mind]

Edit 2: 2:47pm I am starting to feel cold and shitty.... although for the last couple hours I have been out on the roof putting caulk in a leak and turning off the water to the outside before winter and now I have to replace some windows in the porch. I'm trying to hold off on taking a sub for as long as I can. but now that I think about it. maybe I'll take 2mg now, and if need be, 2mg tonight, I think that's what I'll do. It is decided hahhah. 

Edit 3: 7:40pm been doing housework all day. Rewiring outlets, reinsulating windows, putting windows in, turning off the outside water for the winter, etc. The 2mg of sub has done me great and I feel good and my mind has been off things for the day. Tomorrow I start a new job at 8am and I am planning to take 2mg in the morning and maybe take another 2mg with me just in case I get bad but I want to drop off these subs as quick as possible. This is only day 3 I've been on them and I want to get off before a week. Hopefully I can taper to 1mg or even .5 so I don't notice much of a w/d from the sub. then I'm golden and will keep some around for cravings and just give it time. I am just worried about this job tomorrow and worried I will hate it...but at least it will provide something to do and some structure, and if I don't like it, hey, I can keep looking for another one... I got this job in a day. Thanks for all the kind words everybody, and for everybody following my journey and going through the same thing, I feel your pain and feel free to message me. Earlier today I felt like I was on the edge about to fall off and break down and kind of did... tears a bit just overwhelmed with detoxing, getting fired, new job tomorrow, just bought a new house and moved in last week. so it's a LOT at once and I am just trying to stay away from that edge so I can keep it together. The support from you all is amazing and thanks again, I will post later tonight maybe or tomorrow before I leave for work when I start day 5 but again thanks so much guys, I love this sub [pun intended]

Edit 4: took 2mg of sub just now at 9:30pm so I can wake up feeling good to start the new job. I'm gonna bring a couple mg's with me just in case as well but hopefully make it through the whole day without dosing a sub. I want to drop as quick as possible like I've stated 100 times. thanks for the support everybody, I'll post tomorrow before I leave for work I think.. early early. night guys, stay safe",1448214510.0

Saturday, I decided to pick up. And when I got caught getting high by my sober living, I decided to bounce instead of just dealing with the consequences of my actions.

I really thought I had it this time. I was working steps and making amends. I got a car, a job. And maybe I'd allowed myself to be derailed from my program a little bit when I got the car - suddenly, hanging out with anyone until curfew every night was more important than working on myself.

And then I got high, and then I got caught. And suddenly, I was once again packing up my shit and walking out of what had become my home.

so then i get home, and think ""wow, this bag of dope would make some great dope porn, and i dont have an active habit so my dick works!!!!""

but then i get it up, maybe jerk it around a couple times.... and realize how totally fuckin high i am, and as soon as i quit playin to place the dope and get a pic, my flagpole lowers to halfmast (or like 80% mast). doesnt matter what percentage; the point is, i dont feel right showing yall a half-assed (or, half-cocked?) picture of my cock, because its just not nearly as good as it could be

None of the neighbors are very happy.,"Just a few weeks ago there was a family that moved out of my neighborhood and instead of a family moving in to replace them, a 3/4 house for recovering addicts was put there.  I, being more left on these issues thought it was great that these people were being taken out of the slums and put into one of the nicer neighborhoods in town.  My parents are some of the angry ones in this situation and want nothing to do with ""the junkies down the road.""  Not only this, but the neighborhood has a policy that says ""single family homes only"", that the 3/4 house has somehow gotten around.  After doing some reading though, i've found that these 3/4 houses are not doing any real good for the addicts, as some are encouraged to relapse just to keep their housing for example.  At this point i'm just looking for a real answer on what one in a 3/4 house would go through, and if anyone who has been a part of one thinks that it is a good idea to have this house in a neighborhood surrounded by kids.

   Hey guys, I'm a pretty active member in this sub, but need to use a throwaway because friends know my real username.

   With that said, I'm 21 years old, and was addicted to snorting dope for a better part of two years. This past spring, I went to rehab, and was put on suboxone maintenance. I was sober for 4 months except for smoking weed, before using a different substance. 

   During this time of sobriety I was working out, eating right, working, with friends, dating, etc... Then at the end of 4 months sober, I wanted to use something besides weed, so started messing around with coke because my thinking was ""it wasn't as bad as dope"". My addictive personality kicked in and this turned into almost everyday for about a month, and then it finally happened... I relapsed. 

   I originally felt very guilty, and I stopped after a week. I got clean for another couple of weeks, and it happened again. This relapsing turned into a semi frequent thing. I'd binge for 2 or 3 days, and then hop back onto subs for 2 or 3 weeks. This has been happening since August (so 3 or 4 months now).     Recently this past month, it's turned into using every weekend, and using subs through the week. When using I'd turn my back on all of my healthy lifestyle choices I picked up while sober, and just do nothing. I become a recluse, I don't work out, I eat like shit, and generally just become a dirty, isolated person that doesn't want to do anything. I stop caring. 

   Well, this past binge has left me using from Thursday, to today (Tuesday). It makes me so much more depressed, but I cant seem to shake it this time. I CAN'T do this anymore, I'm so much happier when I'm stable on my subs, but I can't seem to just wait the 24 hours and get back on them. What do I do? How do I get there? I don't even want to chip because it turns into this... I want to stop before I get fully strung out again. I know no one has an answer, but I needed to say something to someone because no one knows, not even my therapist who I'm seeing for my addiction knows (thinks I'm sober)... I just needed to say something to someone and let it out. If y'all could offer some advice, or anything to help me out that would great, I love you guys. I love this community. Thank you.

UPDATE: Used again. I'm hoping tomorrow is the day. With family around, and everything going on/not being bored... Maybe I'll last the 24 hours to use my suboxone. Thanks you guys. Yall mean a lot.",1448434324.0

Recently I've had terrible chest congestion, cough, wheezing and all that bad shit. When ever I do sniff i make sure to do it as lightly as possible and I always hit a saline spray before and after. I've been reading about how snorting can damage your lungs so I've really started to freak myself out about this.

Anyone else ever have problems with their lungs after snorting?  I'm trying to find out if snorting heroin is related to my breathing problems. I'm sure it is, and if it isn't the main cause i can imagine it's certainly not helping either. Sorry if this post sounds like the ranting of a hypochondriac pussy (I have to admit, i kind of am one), I'm just trying to get some feedback.

P.S Before anyone says go to the doctor, I have seen one and gotten chest ex rays, they said everything looks fine but the doc did say ""my lungs sound like shit"" so he set me up an appointment with a pulmonologist, prescribed me steroids, albuterol and some antibiotics for my sinus infection.",1448429612.0

Was putting 2 buns up my nose a day every day for a while, several months. Had tried to quit several times but never got far. Last week was the week before going on vacation so i gave it my best attempt yet, stocked up on subs.

 Made it a day without and caved on the monday before last.

 Then used a couple days and stopped again. Made it50 hours this time, but alas i couldn't do it. 

So the time to leave came around and i couldn't bring myself to jeopardize fucking my vacation and life up by getting caught with dope in an airport, so i got what i could in 30s to bring with me. Well i could only afford 9 and here i am on the second night of7 halfway through. But i haven't gotten high at all. Just trying to keep wd away. But I'm still feeling shitty. Not as bad as last week coming off dope but still trouble sleeping and whatnot. 

So my question and concern is the following: when these no doubt run out early(hopefully at least through Thursday), is my wd gonna be as bad as last week? Or since I'm still minorly going through it, will it be slightly easier to deal with? Anyone ever been in the same boat?

 I'm concerned because a. I'm staying with family and b. I finally have a girl who i love and loves me with me and it would kill me to ruin our trip by going through what i had to last week. 

Any help or comments on the situation are greatly appreciated. Thanks. 


Tl;dr: had a huge dope habit. Couldn't quit. On vaca with small supply of oxy. Going to run out soon. Am i fucked or Will wd not be as bad?",1448428665.0

Different doses of Suboxone at different times on different days can vary drastically in terms of effectiveness or ineffectiveness.  I usually dose around 4mg or less, but sometimes take more depending on circumstances (some legit, some recreational).  I also take Wellbutrin SR in the morning (the 24 hour version).

&nbsp;

A few months ago I discovered that if I take a slightly larger dose I can get a SOLID high/buzz -- although it is not as “warm” as other opiates, it is a buzz nonetheless.  However, its effectiveness is hit or miss.  

&nbsp;

Sometimes I dose in the early afternoon, other times late at night, or I will dose around dinner at 4-5pm.  Sometimes my usual dose of 4mg at around 4:00pm will give me a serious buzz, but then 7mg two nights later will do almost nothing, regardless of when I take it (or vice versa)...  Also, every now and then a recreational dose will not result in any sort of “high,” but instead causes a horrible sickness with vertigo/dizziness/sweating.

Nothing has ever come around in my area, or at least that I knew of, so I finally bit the bullet and bought a bit coin and ordered some off the DNM. After 5 years of OxyContin use, I can't wait... stoked doesn't quite cover how excited I am.

Last month it was the day before payday and I was going through withdrawals. Nothing severe, but enough to make me miserable. At some point I got up to get some kool-aid and all of a sudden I had some kind of seizure. I felt really weak and dropped the glass, so weak that I couldn’t even lift up the pitcher to put it back into the fridge. I collapsed onto the ground, into a pool of kool-aid, and laid there til I felt I could get up. Then I cleaned up and went back to bed. I have seizures sometimes due to a blood disorder, so while I was a little worried I figured it was the withdrawals and general malnutrition making things worse. The next day my elbow and knee hurt so badly from falling I could hardly walk. This is where my memory ends. Apparently I went to the ER, but I don’t remember this.

I woke up 2 weeks later and 3 hours away in an ICU, restrained by my wrists to a hospital bed with tubes everywhere. I had been trying to rip my breathing tubes out. They had also drained seven liters of fluid from around my lungs. Later I learned I’d been on life support for 2 weeks and narrowly avoided having open heart surgery to insert a prosthetic heart valve. It was another 2 weeks before I was lucid enough to function on my own and work out what happened. It was endocarditis, which is caused by bacteria getting into your body and building up inside the tricuspid heart valve. I also developed MRSA and was in isolation for weeks. If I hadn’t fallen and hurt my knee and gone to the hospital I would have been dead in a matter of days. My body was already shutting down when I came in. I still have huge gaps in my memory.

I recently moved to a state without needle exchanges, and I’d been reusing the same 15 or so needles for around 3 months. They didn’t even have the numbers and lines on them anymore and all the tips had burs. Some of the tips were bent and I attempted to straighten them out, but I’m sure they were literally shredding my veins. Fucking dumb, I know. I should have just ordered some. This can happen any time though, it doesn’t matter how often you use or what drug you’re shooting. I saw a picture on here the other day of someone’s rig and it looked like it was in a similar condition, and it made me cringe. I just thought I’d put this here because until recently I had no idea that there could be such serious consequences from reusing your own needles. We all know not to share needles, but this is less common. 

I’ve been in the hospital for almost 1.5 months now getting antibiotics through a PICC line, and I have more than 2 weeks to go. They won’t let me leave the floor. I talked to another junkie, who has been an addict for longer than I’ve been alive, when I was sneaking out for a cigarette the other day. He was in the hospital for the same thing a few years ago. He went right back to shooting dope, and since you’re more susceptible to infections after you’ve had endocarditis, he now has an infection in his *spine*. I know if I’d known what can happen I would have been more careful, so hopefully some of you will read this and think about it.

A day off, and THE day off.","10:42am, I woke up about 10 mins ago, looked outside and saw garbage cans so I ran ours down to the end of the driveway, hopefully it gets picked up, I still don't know what day it comes in this new house. I feel fine this morning. I took 2mg of clonazepam [as prescribed] this morning at around 8 so I woke up with little to no anxiety, and hopefully that lasts all day and I don't have to take any Xanax. Also, I hope I don't feel any w/d from opiates/subs today because This is the day I'm planning to be off them. Was only on subs for 4 days, 5 days was my max so I'm pretty happy. I have 1mg still cut, just in case the cravings or w/d get really bad later today, but I don't plan on using it right now. But, since I have the day off today, I know it's going to be a tough one. Keeping myself occupied and keeping the addiction out of my head... I have a feeling, come later today, I'll really be craving, but I'm not going to put the cart before the horse or borrow trouble and just take this day 1 minute at a time. I'll check back later. 

Edit 1: 3:10pm, still haven't taken a sub today and I feel fine. Just got done setting up a new smart TV and sound system in my living room. Sounds and looks awesome! It has really kept my mind off things.. I'm surprised as how motivated I am today. I DID take 2 somas for my shoulder, and it seems to have helped it a lot.. usually I take way more than 2 but obviously this story is about trying to cut back/quit. So I'm feeling pretty good about the living room now, bumping some Pandora while cleaning or whatever. Ironically, the first song that came on was ""It was a good day"" by Ice Cube, and I thought, yeah.. yes it has been a good day. [even though I just dropped half a grand on this set-up], I wasn't expecting to do that, but hey, better a TV and sound system than dope or fent at this point right?

Edit 2: Didn't take any subs today, had a few shots of vodka and listened to music while setting up the living room and made dinner, etc. still feeling good/ok. I'm confident I won't need anymore subs until I get some bad cravings, but as far as physical w/d symptoms, I think I'm passed them. Taking vitamins and staying hydrated of course. Again, thanks for all the support through this, although, a lot of downvoters on todays update... I'll give the day 7 update tomorrow, and we'll see how it goes. I'm confident I won't have much trouble... thanks all for helping me through this. ",1448383635.0

I am a former opioid addict who has experienced withdrawal and relapse more times than I care to count. However, I have officially been clean for three years and I thought it was time to give something back to the community. Therefore, I am posting my long and comprehensive list of medications for dealing with opioid withdrawal. It may be the longest post ever on reddit. I am not a medical doctor but I did study pharmacy. Please use the presented information responsibly and don't do something stupid like take the maximum recommended dose of every medication listed at the same time. If anyone has questions, feel free to ask. I have separated this post into multiple sections with each medication on its own paragraph containing dosage information, cautionary information, and personal experience. Also, I recently added an availability section which says where to get the medications. As you can see, the vast majority of these medications are prescription only. However, if you do not have health insurance or seeing a doctor is impossible for one reason or another, I know of multiple online pharmacies which carry every single drug on this list. feel free to PM me and I can give you the links to the pharmacies.  So here is the list:

Medications for opioid withdrawal from most to least helpful:
1. pregabalin or gabapentin;
Dosage and instructions;
For many, pregabalin/gabapentin works to fight nearly all of the worst symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If taken at the correct dosage, it can releave the extreme anxiety, physical symptoms, and pain of opioid withdrawal. The dosage for these medications ranges widely depending on the person and their level of tolerance. Pregabalin is generally more effective than gabapentin however, gabapentin is also available as a generic and is not a controlled substance. Starting Doses for pregabalin are around 75mg two or three times per day and 150mg before going to bed. The dosage can be increased but it should not go beyond 150mg three times per day and 300mg at bedtime. For gabapentin, the starting dose is 300mg two or three times per day and 600mg at bedtime. The dose can be increased to 900mg three times per day and 1800mg at bedtime. One note with gabapentin is that to get the greatest effect, the dose should be split into incriments of 150-400mg, taken with food, and separated by an hour or so. 
Cautions:
While gabapentin is an uncontrolled substance, pregabalin is in schedule V. This means that the DEA has determined that there is some but limited abuse potential for this drug. gabapentin is less potent and effective but it works on the same receptors. Therefore, make sure you don't take more than the suggested dosage of these medications and do not use them for more than a week or two or else, you could end up becoming addicted to these as well.
personal experience;
In my experience, pregabalin is far superior to gabapentin however, both medications are really good for releaving symptoms. The major difference between pregabalin and gabapentin was that I was actually able to get to sleep using pregabalin alone while I was not able to sleep using gabapentin alone. However, despite being unable to sleep, I didn't feel nearly as bad as I would have without the gabapentin. Both medications virtually got rid of the pain and anxiety of withdrawal. Also, when combined with clonidine, I was almost symptom free.

availability;
These medications are both prescription only drugs. However, pregabalin may be slightly harder to obtain because it is a schedule V controlled substance and it is not available as a generic which means that insurance very well might not cover it. Also, as mentioned above, both of these medications can be abused so if you have a history of drug abuse, your doctor might be less likely to prescribe these medications.
2. Clonidine or tizanidine;
dosage and instructions;
clonidine and tizanidine help with many of the worst symptoms of opioid withdrawal including anxiety, sweats, insomnia, and restless leg syndrome. they are both antihypertensives which means they lowers blood pressure. clonidine should be started slowly at approximately 0.1mg twice a day. However, the dosage can be increased to a maximum of 0.3mg three to four times per day. As for tizanidine, the dose should start at 2mg three or four times per day and can be increased to 8mg four times per day. Clonidine and tizanidine both work as a2 agonists which means they reduce the production of norepinephrine. For treating withdrawal symptoms, tizanidine is usually found to be more sedating than clonidine and helps with muscle pain and spasms. However, clonidine lasts much longer than tizanidine.  
Cautions:
since this medication lowers blood pressure, it should be started carefully and slowly. If you are not careful and take too much to start, you could pass out when trying to stand up. Also, never take clonidine and tizanidine together. Combining of these two medications could result in an excessive drop in blood pressure which could be dangerous or fatal.
personal experience;
Clonidine is also really good at reducing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Particularly the anxiety, runny nose, and swets. It does not do too much for the muscle and bone pane but it does make withdrawal much more tolerable. 
availability;
clonidine and tizanidine are also prescription only medicines. However, they should be extremely easy to get your hands on because they are not traditionally viewed as having any real abuse potential. If your doctor doesn't know you are in opioid withdrawal and you don't want to tell, you can just say something like these medications have helped me with anxiety and/or insomnia in the past.

3. long acting benzodiazepines (chloriazepoxide, diazepam, or clonazepam):
dosage and instructions;
It is well known that benzodiazepines can help with the anxiety and insomnia associated with opioid withdrawal. It is recommended to take a long-acting benzodiazepine rather than a short-acting one because their effects last a greater amount of time an are more stable. Dosage of benzodiazepines range widely depending on the user. However, a non-tolerant user should be able to use about 10-25mg of chloriazepoxide three or four times daily, 5-10mg diazepam three or four times daily or 0.25-0.5mg clonazepam three or four times daily. Chloriazepoxide may be prefferable because it appears to have less recreational use than other benzodiazepines.
cautions;
benzodiazepines are quite addictive when taken for recreational purposes. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is also much more dangerous than opioid withdrawal since it can actually be lethal by causing a seizure. Therefore, do not use high doses and do not take for a period exceeding one or two weeks.
personal experience;
benzodiazepines are quite good for dealing with the insomnia and anxiety. THey don't do too much for the pain but the anxiety releaf and the ability to sleep again make them a really good option. However, pleas heed the warning about taking benzodiazepines for an absolute maximum of two weeks. While I have never experienced benzodiazepine withdrawal, I have a friend who has and almost died of a seizure. 
availability;
Benzodiazepines are controlled substances under the dea schedule IV in the united states. Therefore, you can't just walk into the doctor's office and ask for a script. You will have to either tell your doctor what you are going through or say you have been suffering with anxiety lately if you have a long and trusting relationship with your doctor. Since benzodiazepines are potential drugs of abuse, as with gabapentin/pregabalin, you may find it exceedingly difficult to get a script.

4. baclofen;
dosage and instructions;
This medication is another muscle relaxer which has found use in helping those who are addicted to alcohol and other drugs and medications. It was even compared to clonidine and found to be comparable in releiving withdrawal symptoms while also causing less hypertention. The reason it is number four is that there are fewer reports of it being used for opioid withdrawal. There are other users who report that it is not very good in the accute withdrawal phase but it is more useful for treating post-accute-withdrawal-syndrome and cravings after the major withdrawal is over. If you are taking certain other drugs and medication on this list, you should start at 10mg three times per day and go to a maximum of 25mg four times per day. However, if you are past the acute withdrawal phase and you are using baclofen as essentially a monotherapy or an alternative to opioid agonist substitution maintanance therapy, you can go up to 300 mg a day or more if the relative side-effects and benefits allow.
cautions;
While baclofen has very little in the way of recreational value, abuse can and does happen. Also, if one is using high doses for long periods of time, it can lead to an unpleasent and dangerous withdrawal syndrom potentially as bad as benzodiazepines.
personal experience;
I have never used baclofen by itself in accute withdrawal. The clonidine gabapentin combination with some additives is usually enough. However, I have used baclofen after the accute withdrawals are over. I have even used it when I went on naltrexone and it really did help the cravings. Also, since I was not using baclofen at really high doses, I was able to taper off of it easily since I was getting no recreational effects from it.
availibility;
Baclofen is a prescription muscle relaxer. It may be difficult to just ask your doctor for a baclofen script without some history of muscle spasms but if you have a trusting relationship with your doctor, you can say you want to try it for anxiety or some other related condition. However, you are not likely going to be prescribed enough to deal with withdrawal so you may need to use more than you are prescribed.

5. quetiapine;
dosage and instructions;
This is an atypical antipsycotic. Its main use in withdrawal is to put you to sleep. Many say it is the only thing that can put them to sleep for opioid withdrawal. Dosage is 25-100mg before you want to sleep.
Cautions:
this medication is linked to numerous nasty side-effects such as blood sugar problems and movement disorders if used over the long term at high doses. Therefore, only use it to control the insomnia for as short of a period of time as you need it. Also, do not take doses above 100mg. taking more will not increase sedation and it will increase the likelyhood of developing side-effects related to dopamine antagonism such as movement disorders.
Personal experience;
This is the only medication, other than fairly high doses of benzodiazepines, that has been able to sedate me in the accute phase of opioid withdrawal. In fact, if just getting knocked out is my goal, quetiapine is usually better than benzodiazepines for that indication. It might not work in the absolute worst parts of withdrawal (usually days three throu five) however, it usually works pretty well after this point. I have never taken it more than a week in a row or exceeded a 100mg dose in a 24 hour period. Be warned, doing either of these things significantly increases the risk of negative side-effects.
availibility;
Another prescription medication. However, it does not have any real abuse potential according to most so just say you are suffering from insomniy (which you will be) and you would like to try it.

6. nmda antagonists including memantine and dextromethorphan;
dosage and instructions;
NMDA antagonists are not only useful for slowing tolerance when on opioids but they also may attenuate withdrawal symptoms. however, some users report that they do not work at all or unless taken at extremely high doses. Memantine starting dosage is 5mg three or four times per day with a maximum of 20mg four times per day. Dextromethorphan starting dose is 30mg three or four times per day with a maximum of 60mg four times per day.
cautions;
nmda antagonists can lead to some side-effects such as memory problems and brainfog. Also, do not take high doses of them to help withdrawal or this will result in a dissociated state (robotripping). Also, dextromethorphan interacts dangerously with medications that increase or effect serotonin levels. Examples include SSRIs, ondansetron, and 5-hydroxytryptophan. Also, try and get a preparation containing only pure dextromethorphan since the other ingredients could cause increased side-effects.
Personal experience;
I have tried both dextromethorphan and memantine for both tolerance prevention and releaf of withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, neither of them did too much for me for either indication. To be honest, I probably wasn't patient enough to use them for tolerance prevention. I only used them for a period of about a month or so. However, for withdrawal releaf, I really didn't notice much in the way of help untill I used fairly high recreational doses of dextromethorphan, at which point, I had entirely lost the ability to care about my withdrawal symptoms. The reason nmda antagonists are ranked so highly is because of the many positive accounts by other users on the internet as well as numerous studies that show they have efficasy in opioid withdrawal.
Dextromethorphan is available over the counter in numerous cough and cold preparations. As for memantine, you may have a hard time convincing your doctor to give you a script for this one since its only indication is alzheimer's disease. However, if you have a doctor who is willing to explore non-conventional options, you could say you want to try it off-label for anxiety, depression, or some other related condition.

7. ondansetron;
dosage and instructions;
This medication not only reduces stomach cramps and nausea but also anxiety in some people. Also, this may be a good medication to take alongside your opioid if you can taper because ondansetron is said to be able to reduce tolerance and dependence.  Take an 8mg tablet of this medication three or four times a day as needed.
cautions:
This medication is quite safe from a side-effects standpoint. However, it may interact with serotonergic antidepressants and dextromethorphan in a way which causes serotonin syndrome which is potentially fatal.
personal experience;
This medication works great for the nausea and cramps of withdrawal. Not only that, it did help with anxiety. However, I discovered ondansetron's supposed tolerance prevention toward the end of my usage of opioids. As an added bonus, I believe that ondansetron decreases cravings.
availability;
ondansetron is an antiemmetic normally used for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Therefore, you may need to ask your doctor to prescribe it off-lable for pain or migraines.

8. ultra low dose naltrexone;
dosage and instructions;
While naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, taking it at very low doses can actually help with withdrawal symptoms and craving. It is recommended to dissolve a 50mg naltrexone tablet in a known amount of water and then volumetrically dose. take between 0.01 and 0.2mg between one and four times a day depending on what proves the most useful.
cautions:
while there are almost no side-effects related to the  use of naltrexone at such low doses, make sure you have calculated the amount correctly. Taking too much could cause precipitated withdrawal which is far worse than withdrawal symptoms related to Abstinence.
personal experience;
Ultra low dose naltrexone was another method I did not discover until near the end of my opioid usage. However, I did notice some level of tolerance reduction in the short period of time I was using it together with opioids. I don't know how much it helped with my withdrawal symptoms and craving but I imagine it was better than nothing because there have been some very promising studies about low dose naltrexone in opioid withdrawal.
availability;
you will only need one tablet of naltrexone at the doses being recommended. In order to get a prescription for naltrexone, you could tell your doctor that you want to try low-dose naltrexone for one of its many indications.

9. cyproheptadine or hydroxyzine;
dosage and instructions;
cyproheptadine and hydroxyzine are first generation sedating antihistamines which may help with anxiety, nausia, and insomnia during opioid withdrawal. Cyproheptadine is recommended because it can help more with the sweats, anxiety, appetite loss, and it actually helps you get restorative sleep rather than just knocking you out. The starting dosage for hydroxyzine is 25mg three or four times a day with a maximum dose of 100mg four times aperday. For cyproheptadine, the starting dose is 4mg before desired sleeping time and the maximum dose is 8mg four times per day.
cautions;
be careful when combining these with other medications with antihistamergic or anticholinergic activity. They may cause cognative side-effects such as memory problems and lack of concentration.
personal experience;
I have used both hydroxyzine and cyproheptadine when in in opioid withdrawal. Neither of these medications rank very high because they are simply not strong enough to touch the anxiety and insomnia that come with opioid withdrawal. However, cyproheptadine worked better against withdrawal symptoms than hydroxyzine in my experience. I believe my results can be backed up by looking at some studies in which the binding affinity for the 5-ht2a receptor is much higher for cyproheptadine than it is for hydroxyzine and this is the receptor responsible for anxiety reduction. Cyproheptadine has also been shown to increase the amount of time spent in rem sleep which meens the sleep is actually restorative rather than just being knocked out for example by quetiapine. Cyproheptadine is also an appetite stimulant which could be very important since many people find it so hard to eat during opioid withdrawal.
availability;
Neither of these antihistamines should be hard to get a script for at all. Just say they are the only things that work for your allergies or anxiety. They also have no abuse potential so they should be exceedingly easy to get. 

10. anticholinergics such as biperiden trihexyphenadyl, or scopolamine;
dosage and instructions;
these are anticholinergics which block the action of acetylcholine in the brain. It is thought that many withdrawal symptoms are caused by a rebound of acetylcholine production after discontinuation. Anticholinergics help with anxiety, nausea, stomach cramps, and sweating. the starting dosage for biperiden is 2mg three or four times per day and the maximum dose is 4mg four times per day. For trihexyphenadyl, the starting dosage is 2mg three or four times per day and the maximum dose is 5mg four times per day. For scopolamine, the starting dose is 0.3mg three or four times per day and the maximum dose is 0.9mg four times per day.
cautions;
anticholinergics are known for causing many cognative side-effects such as memory loss and decreased processing speed. As with many of the medications on this list, be careful before driving or operating heavy machinery when you are taking them. Also, while diphenhydramine is quite potent as an anticholinergic, it is not mentioned as being helpful because it has a strong tendency to cause or worsen restless legs syndrome which is a serious problem for many people suffering opioid withdrawal.
Personal experience;
For me, anticholinergics would probably rank number six. In my experience, they nearly removed the sweats, and helped a lot with the anxiety and depression. They were also reasonably good at controlling both nausia and diaria. The reason they are at number ten on my list is because of the extreme cognative problems they can cause, especially at high doses.
availability;
scopolamine is available over the counter in some places such as the united kingdom soled as kwells travel sickness tablets. While they are not available over the counter or by prescription in the united states, they can be ordered from ebay. The only problem is that this is a quite expensive approach and you won't be able to get the price below $0.60 per tablet. As for trihexyphenidyl, you may have a hard time convincing your doctor that you need these prescribed unless you have parkinson's disease or you take antipsychotic.

11. loperamide
dosage and instructions;
Loperamide is actually an opioid. However, it cannot cross the blood brain barrier so it does not cause any of the traditional opioid effects on the central nervous system. The reason it is number nine on this list is that at recommended dosages, it cannot help with any of the cns effects of opioid withdrawal. The recommended starting dosage for loperamide is 2mg three or four times per day and the maximum dosage is 8mg four times per day.
cautions;
Although it has been reported on many other places on the internet, loperamide should not be used at extremely high dosages in order to releave the other symptoms of opioid withdrawal. The other medications on this list should be able to do this to a satisfactory level. Using loperamide at mega doses can cause your heart to stop beating along with constipation that is extremely long-lasting.
personal experience;
loperamide is very good at reducing the diaria that results from opioid withdrawal. However, it really shouldn't be used for much else. The reason for this is that in doses where it really starts to work on the withdrawal symptoms, it can cause potentially fatal desterbences in the rithum of the heart. Not only that but using loperamide to alleviate the other physical and psycological symptoms of withdrawal is the same as taking an opioid to do the same thing. Therefore, it is not only counterproductive, it is dangerous as well.
availability;
soled over the counter as imodium. However, you should buy the generic form since it is the same product and you will likely be going through a lot of loperamide.

12. ibuprofen and other non-steroidal inflamitory drugs;
dosage and instructions;
While many people would think ibuprofen would be completely useless in releaving pain due to opioid withdrawal, in the experience of a significant number of people, it does tend to help to some extent. It certainly won't make any real impact on a high dose heroin habbit but it may be worth keeping in mind to help dull or reduce muscle and bone pain. The dosage for ibuprofen is 400mg four times per day. If you are using other nsaids, your maximum dose should not exceed the maximum prescription dose for the product in question.
cautions;
While ibuprofen is one of the most widely used over the counter medicines and has very few side-effects, it is a nonsteroidal antiinflamitory drug which can cause certain side-effects such as stomach ulsers and intestinal bleeding. Also, there is absolutely no point in taking any dose above the maximum because ibuprofen has a ceiling dose of 400mg and taking more will not do anything except increase potential negative side-effects. Dosages for other nonsteroidal inflamitory drugs were not given because the maximum doseage listed for the prescription strength product in question should be used.
personal experience;
In my experience, using ibuprofen to help pain in the worst part of accute withdrawal is like trying to take a baby aspirin for cancer pain. It just doesn't come close to being strong enough. However, once the horrible accute pain has passed, I have noticed it does help a little bit with the muscle and bone aches that persist for some time after the fact. However, this could just as easily be the placebo effect.
availability;
ibuprofen is available over the counter and its brand name is advil. Naproxin is also soled over the counter and its brand name is aleve. generics are always the cheapest option.

13. acetaminophen;
dosage and instructions;
Similarly to ibuprofen, it does appear to slightly dull the muscle and bone pane associated with opioid withdrawal. The dosage used is 1000mg four times a day.
cautions;
acetominophen can cause severe liver damage. Therefore, do not use this medication if you drink alcohol or regularly take any other medication that causes problems with the liver. Also, similarly to ibuprofen, taking anything more than the recommended dosage will do nothing at all to further releive pain.
personal experience;
almost identical to ibuprofen but if possible, less useful for me. However, people withdrawaling from opioid containing preparations containing ibuprofen find that acetominophin tends to help more with their withdrawal symptoms and vice versa.
availability;
Acetominophen is an over the counter medication with a brand name of tylanol.",1448505029.0

[Vent/Advice wanted],"Right now I'm a bit of an alcoholic. I don't drink all day, just every night from 11PM-2AM or so before I end up falling asleep. Not because of loneliness, really, but it helps me wind down for the night. 

So there was this girl I was talking to (and I guess still am talking) who I am madly in love with. We just have this click. She likes me for who I am regardless the fact that I'm a bit of an oddball, and she's really cute. Oh yeah, and she used to be a heroin addict. She ended up going to jail in February  of this year for heroin and not getting out until May. 

Anyway, she wrote me from in jail. When she got out, we started talking on the regular and hanging out a lot. We honestly enjoyed each others' company. Anyways, starting around late August she started becoming distant a little bit. As in, we started seeing each other less and less. I went out of state for a little bit, this October. When I got back, we met one on one twice. We also met each other at a party just this past weekend. I ended up passing out drunk at the party and she left (we didn't go together anyways, so it doesn't matter). I didn't really hear much from her since then. Maybe I did something stupid, maybe it's her being her.  

Since then, I've been crippling depressed. She was the reason I was happy. Before her, I was fucking miserable. Then she came along and showed me that someone could care. She honestly genuinely cares. Now I know I have male friends that care too, but having a woman who isn't family show you that she cares is a special something. Knowing that if I died, she'd probably be hurt deep down.

But I'm no longer getting the warm and fuzzies from her. Now I have to get it from some place else or else I'm going to die. I'm about to pick up some oxys. I really hope that can help a broken heart. I've heard opiates are good for broken hearts.",1448501218.0

I have a question that wasn't answered in the Suboxone FAQ - in fact, it made me more confused. I've read that many people with heavy dope habits only need 2-4, maybe 8mg, of Sub to stay well for 24 hours. I started maintenance not too long ago and I've had to titrate up every day until a few days ago because I kept getting sick anywhere between 8-15 hours later; it just wasn't holding and no, I wasn't using any other opiates. Now I'm at 24mg which my doctor says is the ceiling and the max prescribed daily amount, and it *is* in fact keeping me well for 24 full hours - no high to speak of, but just normal and functional and no withdrawal symptoms or cravings. So that's good. But why do I need so much? Why was 16 and 20mg not holding me when most people need so little? My habit was heavy don't get me wrong, but it still seems strange. Was it because of fentanyl fucking with my receptors and tolerance? My most recent daily habit was 240-300mg of hydromorphone and 5mg fentanyl daily. I know it's high, but I've seen people with crazy high dope tolerances take 4 or 8mg of Sub and be good. I'm almost more terrified now of how long it will take me to get off of Suboxone... I'll probably be on this shit for the rest of my life now since it'll take me so long to taper that in the end it'll have been so long that WD would be ridiculously long and dragged out. Anyone else have experience with Sub maintenance and require such a high dose? Were you ever able to get off? Thanks for any feedback. Cheers",1448499374.0

I found it in the used/""certified pre-owned"" online listings of our Audi dealership, and thought it looked wayyyyyyyy too good to be true. So called up the place, talked to a salesman and he said they'd had it for a little under 2 weeks, and the price had dropped Monday morning for their Black Friday week thing/whatever Audi calls it

So I ended up buying it straight up, and an incredibly happy with it. It would have been actually a couple hundred over my maximum budget if they hadn't dropped it to the sales price! Rides very nicely. And the mileage is better than any other option I was able to find around the metro area. Glad I pulled the trigger!

I've been non stop going to and fro nonstop since Sunday morning, and I've gripped a bit of boy to play with for my family's trip up north (well, one state NW haha but still long drive) for thanksgiving, and it is heavily reminiscent of some shit that I was gripping like 6-8 weeks ago, but that was in a different city. I did not like that shit, it barely was felt at all, much less getting me nice and high

This stuff has gotten me pretty fucked up so that's cool

BUUUUUT- it's making me feel *awful* sometimes! I have been known to have at least 1g of powder on me at all times, sometimes a ball at a time. And this is the first time I ever remember dope treating my skin like this

My whole face is puffy. My nose is bright red and puffy. Today I developed some horrendous and gigantic circles under my eyes that also went around and up the sides of my eye sockets

I snort my boy, don't IV. My skin is usually very clear and no trouble at all- even if I'm backpacking and only ""washing"" it briefly once/day with some bar soap. Or not bathing at all

But currently you'd think I'm in middle school from my acne situation. I'm about to go hang out with family and cousins, their boyfriends, etc. Imma look like shit! I picked up some Benadryl, both the capsules and the cream, to see if that would help the redness calm down some. I *think* it has. I'm gonna jump in the shower to get ready for dinner and hope that that has some positive effects as well (cold water)

Anyone know of any common cuts that could cause breakouts and skin irritation like this? I've never had a ""histamine"" reaction to H nor codeine like I've read on here, so I'm hoping it may just be that?

I dunno.... This sucks, I'm way too old to be walking around like this and I'm gonna get hardcore inspected and grilled with suspicion lol

I'm still fighting though and I'm getting on a plane tomorrow to visit my mom in California so I'm hoping I can dry out down in Cali where I don't have a dope man. Anyway, I thought I would share a funny story from last weekend. I went up to Detroit to pick up and I brought my ex with me. He has been living with me. We pick up my friend, the connect, and go pick up, smooth as always. He always seems to get flicked, except when he's with us. We go back to my friend's apartment and proceed to snort two packs each, which is usually nothing to us but we had been dry for a bit. We drop my friend back off at work and head south. Only a few miles on the freeway and my ex is nodding hard. He tells me that he is nodding and afraid he is going to crash my car. I told him to pull over at the next exit and I would drive, since I was barley starting to nod. We pull into a Dollar Store parking lot and I realize that it's starting to hit me harder than I though. I told him we should go walk around the Dollar store for a few minutes to ""wake up"" and then I would drive us home. We walk around the dollar store for about twenty minutes and he complains that he just wants to go back home, so we purchase a few things and get in my car, this time I'm in the drivers seat. As I'm sitting there starting my car, I realize that I'm nodding and had just fallen asleep for ten minutes. I wake my ex up and told him we had both passed out for ten mins and I'm going to set my alarm for about 20 minutes to get some shut eye and then we would take off. He agrees. 3.5 hours later he's shaking me awake like ""What the fuck. Where are we?"" I told him about supposedly setting my alarm and he doesn't even remember that. The parking lot is now empty and I can just imagine how many people walked by my car with us passed the fuck out. I was still nodding hard core so we drove across the parking lot to a small shitty motel and paid $40 to spend the night. I can laugh about it now, but I'm glad I didn't attempt to drive.

Iv been trying to remember what song was the soundtrack to the punching of my own V Card and I can't remember and it's annoying me.  I remember actively lying to the girl I did sex with that ""it definitely wasn't my first time, I do this all the time with girls you don't know, they goto a different school.""  Because she was older and cool and I didn't wanna seem like a nerd.  And then I popped in like a minute and she looked at me and started smirking and was like ""your a virgin"" and I was like ""mmmaaayybbeeee"" and I tried my best to melt into her bed Alex Mac style to avoid the obvious embarrassment.  I face booked her out of nowhere yesterday and we are still trying to work out what provided the soundtrack to the first of many embarrassing sexual experiences.  I think either the movie ""Around the Fire"" was playing or it was probably some hippy shit like Buju Banton or something.  I'm normally really good at remembering the little details to significant experiences like this, especially with music because I'm constantly imagining whatever's happening as a movie.  

I can remember what was playing the first time I ever sniffed OxyContin.  It was half of an OG 20mg OC and Coldplay - CLOCKS was playing while I sat in my friends black Volvo in some abandoned suburban driveway in the middle of the woods.  And I can remember that the first time I ever sniffed dope I was sitting in the back of my friends shitty pickup truck leaving the hood while the Blood Brothers - The Shame played.

The main thing it does for me though is allow me to shit twice a day when on opiates (currently 4mg of sub daily, formerly 100-200mg morphin IV daily). I was suprised that dosing magnesium actually worked but every time I take 750-1000mg of magnesium after a meal in the morning it seems to loosen my bowels right up. Also the kale shakes I make help tremendously also. So eat your veggies kids and take your vitamins, specifically magnesium. It works for me and I used to only shit about once every 2-3 days!

I woke up about an hour ago and have been staring at the ceiling for a while... craving. Missing the white powder I used to wake up to then sink back into bed with. ugh, it's driving me fucking crazy right now. I am trying so fucking hard not to order any, I know if I do, my girl and family will be so fucking pissed, shit will go down. I didn't take any subs yesterday, and I don't plan on taking any today, the physical symptoms are basically gone but the psychological cravings are incredibly intense and If this is how I'm going to feel all day, I might take 1mg or 2... I'm actually trying not to take 8mg just to get the slight blanket feeling, and I'm trying so fuckin hard not to go pick up some dope or roxies too. This is the hardest craving day I think I have woken up to since I stopped using.... 

Edit 1: 10:33.. ok, I realize I'm going to be thinking about it all fucking day long and I need advice. I haven't taken sub in over 24 hours, and my last dose was only 1 mg. so I'm good. Here's my question... Should I take some suboxone, kratom, make some pst, or take some tianeptine to make the cravings go away? There is a war in my head right now on what to do or not do. 

Edit 2: 11:11am Took some kratom, like a heaping tablespoon, hopefully it stops the cravings, or at least subsides them enough. I decided kratom because it usually gives me some energy too, and I have to work at 3, possible 2nd dose before then depending on how I feel.

Edit 3: 1:53pm, the 2 big tablespoons of kratom took my cravings away and even gave me a little buzz. I am feeling much better and more confident than before about not copping for sure. Thanks for the advice and support guys, really. You all have helped so much on this jouney. I work at 3 in a position in the restaurant I have never worked before so we'll see how that goes, but I'm not too worried about it. Thanks again, I'll update later tonight when I get home

Edit 4: 11:22pm. I got off work around 8... got home and relaxed, listening to music and shit feeling pretty good. I took like 300-400mg of tianeptine to see if I could feel it now that my tolerance is the lowest it's been in a year, but I still didn't feel anything.. or.. much at all. I'll just stick to kratom if I have cravings tomorrow (I'm sure I will), and keep going as long as I can. Getting off fent analogs has been a real trip, and you guys have made it so much better/easier/fun, all the support, the messages, the advice, words of encouragement, everything. I love this sub and the people in it. I am officially done with fent analogs, I am 99% sure about that. I don't see a circumstance where I would order more.. it's not worth it. I just wanted to say thank you to everybody who helped me get through this first week. I know there is a long road ahead of me, but I won't bore you guys with a day to day update anymore. I feel like I just wanted you all to help me through the first week. Tapered off the fent, to dope, tapered off the dope to subs, and tapered off the subs, all in a week. (I had been tapering the fent analogs for about 2 weeks though beforehand because my tolerance was insane). But again, I just wanted to thank everybody who followed this week long journey and gave me support.

Hey guys! Thought I'd give you a quick update from the above post!

   Today was thanksgiving, and I had planned on finally hopping on my subs today. Thinking that I'll be with family, good food, alcohol, etc... I'd be able to last the full 24 hours to induct it because I'll be doing things to keep me occupied.. I used the last dope I had at 9pm Wednesday night, so I only had to wait until 9pm thursday tonight!!

   I arrived at my Aunt's house around 11:30, and while helping in the kitchen, I found a bottle of 1mg blue xanax footballs for her old dog that recently passed away... PERFECT OPPORTUNITY! These could definitely help me get me get to 9pm to induct those subs! I scored 8mg of the xanax total. I took 2mg right away, and 2mg more an an hour or two later.

   After eating, and hanging out for a bit (5pm now), I decided to head home. I got home, took the 4mg i had left sublingually and  then smoked some of a blunt. I was feeling pretty nice, and before I knew it, it was 9pm! YES! I MADE IT! I took my full 8mg strip, waited 20 minutes. And it is currently 12:20am now, I have one more 8mg strip under my tongue as i type this, so no matter what happens, I won't even be able to get high for like 3 or 4 days if I even wanted to! However... I hope it's much, much longer than that. I want to try to beat my old record of 4 months of sobriety. 

   Thanks so much for the kind support in the other thread you guys, it meant a lot. Life gets better when sober, I just hope I can last. Thanks again you guys!

   I've had many large, rough, bumps in this road called sobriety, but I've learned you just have to keep on going. Those obstacles will slow you down a bit, and even make you stop sometimes, but you eventually get over it and you keep going.

I had cold sweats, was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and opiate dependency. I should have not disclosed my opiate dependency to my psychiatrist so she would have prescribed me good meds and not non habit forming ones (aka ones that don't work: vistiril for anxiety and trazadone for sleep), but I didn't think about how being 100% honest would bite me in the ass that way.

3udxmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3udxmm/advice_bupe_or_methadone_january_is_coming/,11,https://redd.it/3udxmm,kokoves,[ADVICE] Bupe or Methadone? January is coming,"**Before the incoming analytical wall of text (but please read it), the tl;dr question is:** 

*""Should I choose Methadone OR Buprenorphine for my maintenance programme? Important fact: I suffer from chronic terrible Physical, Neurological, as well as ""mental""/Psychiatric disorders (full info inside the wall of text) which make my selection of the substitute important.""*

-----
**Okay, let's do it:**

No need for throwaway, all my family and friends know, even my ex-bosses and co-workers. I am unemployed now, but not due to any addiction issues messing with my jobs -- my boss' business was bankrupt because she.... She WAS paying her taxes during a time of great economical turmoil in my country. All my other freelance things fell through... Greek irony or a Greek Tragedy? For now, I'm doing various freelance things here and there (not all legal, to be frank with you), and I had to return to my mother's house and live with her again..... I am sure you've heard what's happening in my country :(

I am 29 years old. I'm also a musician. A starving one, that is. That's my main thing, but all the others are what help my make money.

I'm a /r/opiates subscriber, feel like a family member here, even though I post and reply usually when the time zone fits :) There are only a couple of excellent people who know me here -- just saying this because I don't post all the time here. Want you to know that I didn't just appear from a vacuum.

Additionally, I'm utterly sorry for the /r/titlegore material, but I thought I had to type a very laconic title for my self post. The post itself will be a huge wall of text, but I really need advice (you'll understand why; it's a very complicated medical position I'm in.)

Needless to say, be gentle with me with my use of english :) it's my 2nd language. Born and raised in Athens, Greece.

----

Ok, before analyzing my situation regarding the dilemma I have **re: which substitute should I choose for my maintenance**, I would like to share ALL the Medical information about me, because my chronic health conditions are the VERY REASON that I feel it's an important decision to select the correct substance for me.

The public state programme people that work at OKANA are truly hard-working and good-willed folks, but after  four (4)  dissapointing appointments where they couldn't even bring or sometimes even find the correct file of my case, much less have a fruitful conversation and session, I really need the advice from people that have been through the Experience of the Maintenance; especially those who have been through both Methadone and Bupe at different times.

#---**PRELIMINARY INFO**---

**Time Appearance of my Health Conditions**: 

They all started before my ""opiate career"" and they are chronic. Sole exception, my epileptic seisures, which are a direct result of a heavy Benzodiazepine abuse in the past (heavier than the present one).

**The Conditions --- (All diagnosed by private and/or state doctors - no self-diagnoses here)**: 

a. Generalized Anxiety Disorder, 

b. Panic Disorder, 

c. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (NOS), 

d. PTSD from a homophobic abduction and virtual execution during my high-school years, 

e. Trigeminal Nerve pain in my face [whoever suffers from this will cringe just be reading this], 

f. Chronic Pain in my lower back and my neck after only 2 fucking years of track and field athletics, 

g. Issues with gender dysphoria from a young age,

h. Grand Epileptic Seizures. They used to happen in the years of heavy benzo abuse (2009-2013), but I will still get one if I miss a dose for more than 24 hours. I am first and foremost a Benzo addict; not just a Heroin one.

i. (related to h) --- If I throw up when the benzo withdrawals begin, my epiglottis gets ""stuck"" for a good 1-2 minutes, and I am unable to breath. The epiglottis seems to be something like in a cramp or something, and it opens very slowly. Until it opens, I can only ""swallow"" air, which goes to the stomach. Terrible experience, the most recent development (after a series of events in 2013), which make a possible Precipated Withdrawal Syndrome a matter of life and death, as you can imagine. I literally cannot afford to go through that.

**Substances of Addiction**: 

I am an EXCLUSIVE Benzodiazepine (Flunitrazepam) and Heroin (Afghan #3) addict for almost 9 years. I use the heroin always intranasally (=I snort it), and have never gone through any period/phase of my life where I was shooting it. I put my sweet, heavenly Benzos under the tongue and let them slowly dissolve. I do not use any other substances at all. No weed, no Psychedelics, no MDMA, no crystal meth, no cocaine, no Alcohol (soft nor hard), and finally not even caffeine-- because it ruins my high. The ONLY other thing I use is Tobacco (plain, usual cigarettes), if Nicotine counts.

**Current Habit Dosages**: 

I use 4 to 8 mgs of Flunitrazepam and 1,5 to 2 grams of Heroin per day. The heroin I currently use, is of a very high quality.

**Current Habit ROAs**: 

All these years I use benzos and heroin simultaneously [I call it ""slowball""], and I keep an extremely strict time schedule (at least when everything goes okay) --- I snort a solid gram of H whilst having 2 pills of Vulbegal (=the greek Rohypnol, 2mg of Flunitrazepam per pill) in the morning when I wake up at 8:30-9:00 and then I eat breakfast. 

At noon, at about 14:00, before eating, I will snort the rest of my dope (0,5g to 1g... whatever is left depending on the hustle...) and usually pop another Vulbegal pill or two... or three... But not any more than that. 

Back in the day, I used to use at least 24mgs of Flunitrazepam per day, some days even a whole pack (30 pills x 2mg = 60mgs of roofie juice in my mouth). Dangerous times back then, that left me with permanent health issues (h and i).

#**ADVICE BREAKDOWN**:

You read my condition. I am a human upper. I was born into this world with my whole nervous system, stimulated by default. 

Let alone all my experiences of growing up as an effeminate gay kid in the Greece of the early 90s..... Excellent combo.

I need to choose between Methadone and Buprenorphine, **depending on the following factors**:

The choice is mine, but for some reason the people there, INSIST that Methadone is not good for me, and that ""it's a shame to take it in such a young age"" (*their words; do they make any sense?*). They *insist* that Bupe is the best option for me, and I've given them every single fucking medical paper and medical history that I have. They say that it is my choice, but their advice is that they BET on bupe. Part of myself wants to have a seizure the moment that mofo bupe pill dissolves under my tonuge, just to show them that the state workers treat addicts like numbers and not like human beings with each one of us being a unique medical case.

1. Which of the two substances has the biggest risk to lower down the seizure threshold?
2. I need the more ""noddy"" one. Of course not for recreational purposes, but because of my anxiety disorders plus everything else. I've heard rumors that Bupe has a ""stimulant"" effect. If this turns out to be true, I won't last long in the programme. My anxiety will skyrocket, and I will become just like I was before starting Benzos and Heroin: A handicapped person afraid of literally everything. I will start having panick attacks again, and I CANNOT AFFORD to be unable to get out of the house with this economic hell we are living in right now in my country.
3. The Mainteinance Programme -thankfully- ""tolerates"" for some weeks the illegal Flunitrazepam abuse, but they tell you to lower it ""by yourself"" during that period of time. If you keep taking Flunitrazepam after that window of time, they kick you out of the programme... And -oh- they know, because you give urine samples every single fucking day before they give you your methadone/bupe. 

This is some thirld-world country bullshit, please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks that.

4. After that dangerous semi-self-titration of Flunitrazepam... Here comes the IRONY: They prescribe you for FREE Lorazepam and Pregabalin (Lyrica). You only have TO ASK, AND THEY PRESCRIBE THEM. I really have no idea how they can differentiate the benzos in our urine samples, but they somehow manage to know if you have taken any Flunitrazepam, even under their Lorazepam prescription...
5. Get ready for this: They prescribe Seroquel to everyone. EVERYONE. Of course, you are not obligated at all to take it, but how can they be so irresponsible by even suggesting such a combination? I mean, an Opioid+Benzo+Pregabalin+A fucking Neuroleptic ??? There are some Maintenance Treatment patients, that are on Methadone, Lorazepam, Pregabalin, AND Seroquel. These people are drooling and are walking stereotypes --- worse than when they were addicts on the streets, just because they lack education and they don't know any better, so they ""trust the experts"".
6. Just a note: Pregabalin is the shit. A friend of mine who is not in greece anymore, used to give them for free to me, and -not only it calms your whole nervous system-, but it also really stops the mental cravings 100% when in WDs. I imagine that Pregabalin is key when combined safely with Methadone or Bupe. I beleive in this medicine -- it was even anxiolytic and I felt so much better psychologically. It really had an anti-depressant effect. Plus, it is used as an anti-epileptic, so that is a plus for me! I will 100% ask them to prescribe them to me.

-----------

**Okay, to finish this**:

I am leaning towards Methadone, of course. I have faith that Methadone itself, together with Lyrica and Lorazepam will really keep me off the streets. I am not doing this to get rid of my addictions. 

I am doing this to be Legal. 

To put it cynically: My new, free of charge dealer will be the State of Greece, from January on. 

After all, I was accepted in the Indefinite Time Programme, not the programme that slowly but steadily lowers your substitute... 

And it was MY choice. For all the reasons mentioned. 

I need an opiate to function. I wish I could show you my life, my suicide attempts before researching Opiates and deliberately starting to use them as self-medication after YEARS of shrinks, pills, and psychotherapy methods that did nothing to me. Only money on the trashbin.

What's your opinions on Subutex and Suboxone? If the final examination doctors insist and they don't let me chose Methadone (unlikely, but you NEVER KNOW), how's the combo with Lorazepam and Lyrica is going to work?

More importantly, are 24 hours safe without any opiate use before the Bupe to avoid the hell-on-earth that is called Precipated Withdrawals? 

Because the doctors of the programme here are out of their minds: 

*They say to the Bupe patients to abstain from Heroin, ONLY 6 HOURS before their first dose of Buprenorphine.* **They are either insane, criminally indifferent to the patient's suffering, or sadists.**

#Help me. January is coming so, so soon.

Now on my right arm I just noticed another one pop up today. It looks exactly like a pimple you would get on your face. Little mountain, white at the top. I'm concerned at what these could be.

I use 80mg oxy 4-5 days per week. However, I typically only ever do 40-50mg, or 2-3 15mg lines in an evening. For example, my week might look like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday for days of use, doing a 15-20mg line at 5:30PM, 7:15, and 8:45. Sometimes, it's only two lines, and after my first line they can typically be only 10-12mg lines rather than more full ones. On the days I do not do opiates, which can be anywhere from one night to two nights off, I do not feel W/D, though, considering the times I take two nights off, it really amounts to not taking any in 72 hours. From what I've read, I should have some noticeable W/D symptoms, as other forums say even 2 days on 1 day off will get me a dependence. I've been using the 80s like this for about 3 months. So, why don't I get W/D?",1448558787.0

I think I fucked over a fellow opiate user today(this is not a ""/r/opiates meetup"" thing mods so pls don't drop the banhammer, guy is just a friend and opiate user and its not about meeting up with him or anything cause well I was with him for a while before lol)



But anyway let me explain.

Long story short is, I live in a tourist town (don't ask me which ones fuccbois) and I help out a decent amount of people. I get a lil something for my troubles, not a ton because I hate middlemanning the shit out of people cause i've been there done that and it sucks (i'm very fair and I only ask for what I get once, or have it split up over 2-3 times if they can't afford ""me"" outright).

I always go through the same 2 guys for BTH/white for both my personal stuff and friends when they come to town and shit. I try to go to guy ""A"" as much as I can because its the better stuff for a (slightly cheaper) price. However, guy ""B"", which isn't a bad connect at all, is pretty much always available or can be within an hour or two... while guy A works like 9am-6pm for what seems to be 8 days a week. So it can be kinda tough to get to guy ""A"" if the bidness is going down during normal bidness hours.

So basically i'm getting a gram from guy B. Not a huge deal at all. Do the damn thang, business as usual. I have it in my hand but I don't check it out. I just put it in my pocket. For one, its BTH but its ""raw"" so it was a tan powder that turns black when water or heat is applied. Of course a G of powdery substance looks diff than a G of a chunk of solid black. Anyhoo I bring it to my new homeslice and he peeps it and is like, 100% convinced its a half - G, not a full. I explain to him that can't be right, since hes used to the solid-black stuff and this is powdery.

Idk what to say since i've been fuckin with ""B"" dude for 10 months, i've not once had an issue of it being short (either for me or for a friend). That's kinda one thing connect ""B"" is about, if you're there when you're copping he always scales it out in front of you. This wasn't the case clearly since we were copping out in public, but he always double-checks/weighs before he leaves the house if he is meeting me or someone out. Shit, we aren't friend friends but i'd say connect ""B"" and I are kinda friends, shit we kick it (not like for hours but you know) sometimes, i'm welcome in his home, i've had dinner with him, his wife and kid know me well, etc etc. Well, after homie and I parted ways, he got a scale and said it was pretty much off a full half G.

Now something doesn't click here. There are two (fairly equal) things that could of happened. 

A: The bag actually was short
B: The guy that got the scale either doesn't know how how to scale or has kinda been schemin from the beginning to say its short to try and get free shit

Now, to most people, this seems pretty clear cut of ""man your dealer fucked you its obvious"".  But like I said, I have not ONCE had an issue with weight (or quality tbh). This guy ""B"" scales it out at the start of the day or when he gets it or whatever, then does it again before he goes out for runs or he scales it out for you where hes and thats both me copping AND me copping but saying its for a friend. My dealers aren't stupid. They realize if they fuck up on something like a short or something and don't fix it, they lose my business which ain't nothing to scoff at. 

I apologized to dude, but if he really only got a half gram and paid for a full I feel really fucking bad. Like realllllly bad. First off, that shit aint cheap. Second, he seems like a really cool dude. Chill, down to earth, kinda hippy type. Super into the Greatful Dead and whatnot. What kinda hurt was him mentioning that hes gotten ripped off a couple times by people in my town. Which I understand 100%, people here are out to make a buck ""fair"" or not. I mean, if he indeed only got a half a gram, at least it wasn't fake stuff or something. 

I just can't figure it out. If it was short, it 100% had to of been an accident. Homeboy doesn't just randomly short a gram like that. Idk man. Sorry for long post guys i'm just overtired had a really weird day and needed to vent.",1448704040.0

I was doing just fine without breakthrough meds for like 13 days until I suddenly got my period. It's now been three days of barely eating anything (I've had one half slice of cinnamon bread, a quarter of a bowl of sweet potatoes left over from Thanksgiving dinner, and a quarter of a bowl of mashed potatoes, corn and gravy), and of feeling the need to throw up/be sick pretty constantly, with literally nothing in my stomach to throw up. I've had what I call the ""nervous shits"" that set all this off too, a twisting in my gut that gets me needing to shit/throw up/both. I half think I caught a bug or something, because to be completely honest the absolute only ""withdrawal"" type feelings I've been having is the wretched stomach/throw up symptoms.

And I think to myself that I will drop this addiction at somepoint. But I know i wont. I know I will spend everyday for the rest of my life wanting to get high. And I can't stop myself. I'm terrified of the future. Because I know someday , honestly at the rate I'm going and how many times I've gotten lucky to wake up. I give myself two years before I'm dead. I don't want to get high . I've been to rehab multiple times being dead set on staying sober. But I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart, that you are mine, and we shall not part.
You'll regret that you tried me, they always do.
But you came to me, not I to you.
You knew this would happen. 
Many times you were told, but you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
You could have said no, and just walked away.
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
I'll be your master; you will be my slave.
I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave.
Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? 
Its all up to you.
I can bring you more misery than words can tell.
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.""

The date and time I snorted heroin for the very first time. I ordered a couple New York stamps from the darknet, and they arrived without issue.

I remember the day more vividly than almost any other occasion. I know the exact date because it was the day before the Minneapolis Pride parade, and I was excited about my first couple stamps for the weekend.

I was at my apartment in a Minneapolis suburb when the mail came. I could hardly open the package, I was so excited.

I cut up a nice line, and up it went. My immediate thought was, verbatim, ""It feels just like Vicodin. That's it? Boring.""

Not 10 minutes after I did my very first line of dope, my mom arrives with  groceries and asks me to help get them. I enthusiastically agreed. It was, to this day, the most fun I've ever had unloading groceries.

Afterwards, I went on a long walk. None of my friends were around but it was really sunny out so I wanted to be outside. Best. Walk. Ever.

I don't think I've ever been that happy. It was scary. I didn't even get nauseous until like the 3rd or 4th day of consecutive use.

After my walk, I went home and put on a history documentary, and did a few more lines. At this point I was nodding hardcore and I ended up falling asleep for 4 hours. During my nap I had the SCARIEST DREAM EVER. There was this dark red demon chasing me. I had heard of opiate nightmares, but man, that felt so real. It was the only time heroin ever gave me nightmares, though.

I slept well that night.

I spent the next couple months making bigger and bigger orders of stamps, successfully chipping for a while even. Even ordered some awesome DMT I smoked with a friend.

Later on I found reddit (namely, this sub) but I can't remember HOW I found it. Ended up finding a local connect, and, well, the rest is history.

Does anyone else remember details about their very first time? Do you remember the day? I can't believe how many details I can play in my head of that day.",1448679273.0

Been using H daily for two years, half gram a day habit. SO, I can't remember the last time I got my period, and I had a few questions for you ladies (and knowledgable men/boyfs) in recovery AND currently using.

1) If you are a current user, are you still regular? If not, do you ever bleed anymore? 

2) Recovering addicts, did you ever regain normality to your monthly cycle? 

3) Recovering addicts, did anyone have a hard time getting pregnant later in life after you quit? 

I'm feelin' pretty down about this whole thing, to me it feels like I killed the beautiful life source within me and that is something I treasure as a woman. Please give me some hope for the future, I'd love to have kids within the next 10 years (when I'm sober!!!) and I'm hoping this doesn't affect my fertility. Please keep rude comments to yourself this is a natural thing part of the cycle of life and I'm just curious how H has affected that.

I'm a non-user, but my boyfriend is newly recovering from an IV H addictions It has been a bit over two months, though he fessed up to using a couple of Vicodin when he hurt himself at work a bit ago. As far as I know, that has been it; however, I have noticed that his pupils become pretty damn small for a few days and then they will be normal or large again. He claims to not be using H or any opiates for that matter, but I just don't know. (And no, when his pupils are large, he doesn't seem to be going through any w/d symptoms.) 

So, my question is, for any of you that are clean or have gone extended amounts of time, is that something you have noticed in the first months becoming clean???

She ended up with an abscess that has progressively gotten worse. I know this probably wasn't the best thing to do but what I've done in the past with my abscess is to puncture it and squeeze out all the puss. The swelling usually goes down in an hour or 2 and then beaks fairly rapidly over the next couple days. 

Anyways last night I punctured her abscess and out came a fountain of puss, blood, and globs of black and green chunky goo. It had a foul odor to it and we got A LOT of puss and nasty gunk out of it. Currently it's still slightly swollen but much better than yesterday. The area is also warm to the touch. Like I said the swelling has gone way down BUT the redness has spread from a softball size to a football size since last night. I'm not sure if that's from messing with it last night or if the infection is getting worse. 

Should we give it another day to see if it starts getting better on its own? Should we go to the urgent care facility right now? Any advice would be much appreciated. I know this isn't something you should procrastinate on as a worse case scenario you could lose the limb. I will post up a picture shortly.

Im a natural loner, I never figured out how to make and keep friends. I've always just kept to myself having NO idea how to enjoy myself if Im not high.

I speak in the meetings now, something you couldn't pay me to do 30 days ago, I engage im conversations with my fellow rehab people, in activities I would have never done. Ive made genuine friends in here who we laugh and have a grand time every day and just plain old fun withOUT being high.

I was so nervous and scared to come here in the beginning, I thought my old habit of being a loner loser would follow and Id be ""that guy"" but it doesn't work like that here, you're forced to break out of your shell. I honestly believe this was the best decision Ive made in my life. I am on top of my game mentally, physically and even spirituality.

I'm mid 30's, male, caucasian.  Long time coke and fairly new dope user.  Ive gone through the ringer this year after a 2 year dope binge.  I was living in NYC and got instantly hooked on OC 30's and moved on very quickly to dope.  Hells kitchen was not a good place for me to figure out I loved smack.  Moved to the upper east side and made daily trips back and forth to HK to score.  I was a successful IT person with a solid long term relationship a dog and just generally a good life.  Nothing is ever as it seems.  Ive spent many years trying to heal from the suicide of my father (i was 11) and most of that healing has come through talking to people I love about that deep scar and what he meant to me and how to move on with my life and try to heal.  I consider myself an awake person and am in touch with my pain and the pain of others.  Sometimes I think I can take too much of that pain on and that played into my quick uptake into the world of opiates.  

I ruined my life so fast it was unbelievable.  I read this forum quite often and know there is a spectrum of people and how slow or quick they are sucked into the underworld of smack.  I was probably more ready than most and all buttered up for it and having had no idea... i fell for it hook line and sinker.  

I've gone through at least 20-30  withdrawal cycles in 2 years mostly because of money issues.  It wasn't until I found subs that my life began to suck a little less.  I was a insulfator for most of my last few years and just started shooting within a few months from today.  What a terrible idea that was.  For all you people who are thinking of taking that jump... please slow your roll.  You know it's a bad idea.  You will like it more than before and you will have more health issues, youll be OD'ing before you know it and it's basically a sure thing for many of you who make that jump.  

Im back in employment and I'm really trying to get my shit together.  Ive been lucky enough to have a family who understands what i am going through and I can be completely honest.  If it wasn't for them I would most certainly be dead in a gutter and I am being completely honest.  I feel for people going through this without support more than I can explain.  Please if anyone would like some support with talking it out... you can pm me anytime.  Thats an oath.  I will do my best to reply to you in a timely manner.  Maybe we can help each other.  

Ive never posted in here and must say this forum and the internet in general has been incredibly helpful as most of you know.  Most of us dont know where to turn to for information and support at first and since the internet is where we go for everything anyway.. it just makes sense. 

I am still in a bit of denial about my status as an addict.  I know I need to go to meetings and work the steps at this point.  Just having a hard time getting over the hump.  

I wish all of you trying people strength to get through this winter and the holidays.  Winter makes being a junky miserable.  I hate the cold now.  Its become my worst enemy and I know it has everything to do with dope.  I only feel warm when im shooting.  it's a fucked up realization. 

Sorry for the ramble.  I just wanted to get some of this off my chest.

I was on the done for about 3 years on a pretty high dose 160ml daily ,80mg Valium and 15mg of zimmervaine . 
      Came off about 2 years ago and that was a real cunt did it cold turkey thought it was never going to end WD lasted a good couple of months but got through it and only bought dope twice in those two months really just for rest bite for a day . Once I'd come off after a few months I started dabbling again really just through boredom and having money to burn . Started off smoking it and would go down to an old friends most days and give him a charge . Though it wasn't the same never got a nod just felt more content , more energy etc . My friend didn't smoke he IVd so eventually I got on the pin and would just binge on it really just taking it for the sake of it and to help out my friend. Then I'd stop and substite it with done for 3/4 days to avoid any WD . Then go back on after a week or so . I think doing this has fucked up my tolerance as when I have a hit after a break it won't do barely anything ! I'll do a half G in two shots back to back because it's hardley touching my sides and it isn't the dope other ppl I'm with are coughing out there nuts !

I have a pretty high tolerance to opiates. But have very little experience with the Hydromorphone. I have done it before but its been a while. I know both of these drugs are very short acting but I was just looking to get some insight from you wonderful people and if you guys had any experience on mixing the two or taking one after the other.

So I check out some new music in the parking lot next to my bank while I wait for the location of where were meeting. I'm about 17 hours into the sickness so my ass is speaking to me pretty violently. 

I decide I didn't want to risk missing him if I had to shit my pants after he told me where to go. I drive over to the nearest store with a bathroom and start hauling ass in. 

As SOON as I close the stall door he calls and says be at so and so in 5 min bc I'm late for work.

At this point I had to make a choice. 
Do I try and push this behemoth out in a quick fashion or do I try my best to hold it till I can get my shit.

I chose option b.

I get there and God damnit he's running behind, I could have taken my sweet time and not be risking mud butt. 
He shows up, I cop, but damnit if this isn't the one time he wants to chat. 
I try and tell him my situation but he gets all butthurt (no pun intended) and won't let me go before he finishes his life story.

Finally Hes done and I decide maybe if I do my shit it will calm the raging beast like in the past. I make quick work of it and it's a nice nice rush.

I've lurked this sub for a long while now, before I signed up for Reddit even. I never really post but I enjoy reading it. I remember when SlicedPears died, when Tracey started sending out packages, oh_no_five_oh announcing himself, idk a bunch of trivial shit that comes from an online community. I like it here. It's an addiction in itself lol.


I've probably used opiates since about 2006-2007 or so. Got started the way most people did, I had oral surgery and a decent sized script for 7.5/325 hydros. I loved smoking weed and psychedelics, loved Erowid and learning about pharmacology and chemistry, so this was just something new to try. 


Then later I had a knee surgery and 10mg Lortab's, that was fun. I knew this was something I liked. Then I started dabbling in buying yellow Norco 10's and peach OC 20's and the 40's from a guy I knew. On and on and on it goes.


Finally after a few years of fucking with those pills and whatnot with some of my best friends I started blowing Opana's and Roxy and fucking I loved it. Started throwing Xanax and Klonopin into the mix, potentiators, whatever. I ended up getting a connect via a co-worker who would give Roxys to me at absurd prices because he didn't know how much they were worth, so I was able to use alll the time (including at work, which was amazing because I hated my job)


Fast forward a couple years of blowing oxy and chomping any opiates I could get my hands on, all the while hiding this from my significant other that I live with, suddenly my best friends Dad died.


It was really traumatic for both of us. Best friend ended up getting way into heroin. I never judged her for doing it or whatever and we stayed friends , until she really started going down wild dark paths, losing the house she lived in, getting caught up in insane lies, people, dealers, law enforcement, all this shit.


Long story short, I don't have any connects anymore. For anything. 


We did dope several times together, it was alright. The majority of the time I either got way too high and nodded uncontrollably, or i'd get sick and be couchlocked. I loved the stimulating, conversative, clear, motivating high that OC gave me.


I live in a small little town full of conservative people and don't have any likeminded friends. 


I haven't done any opiates or any drug with the exception of weed in about 3 months.


But I still can't get the want to go away.


I think about getting high constantly. Getting jammed outta my fuckin' skull. Eating a 30, railing one, and a half a Xanax. Then going to the beach and walking the boardwalk. Cold winters bundled up, half nodding smoking cigarettes with my best friend. 


The copping, the ritual of using, and all the good times I had with friends, crazy adventures or schemes, or how I could be having an awesome time doing literally anything no matter how dull, if only I had some pills. 


Every minute i'm bored or lonely, my mind immediately goes to opiates.

You know how when you're preparing for surgery, you have that unrealistic and unfounded fear of waking up during the operation and freaking the fuck out even though ""that will never happen?"" Fucking tell your doctor, surgeon, and anaesthesiologist about your fucking addiction and tolerance. Most general anaesthetics are fentanyl or a form thereof (alfentanil, etc) [**Edit:** Or used in junction with a gas/other medication]. If you have a tolerance, they fucking need to know how much you use so they can give you the proper amount of fentanyl. When I woke up and started thrashing around fucking terrified and tried to rip out my IVs they had to pin me down and start shooting me with more fentanyl, I asked what the fuck it was and I remember them saying ""it's fentanyl try and relax,"" before passing the fuck out while trying to enjoy the rush from the huge dose they were using.

When I first started to snort H my oxy tolerance was about 70-130mg a day depending on what I could gt that day. When I switched to H I would get high as hell. 

Anyway, just now I decided to give something a try. I read that snorting a shot of water would help clear out the nose of debris, open up the nasal passages, and I suppose clear out the blood vessels in my nose to help absorption. I snorted just a little water. Snorted a line, and boom I am high as a kite. 

This is like my 4th bag in 2 hours so I can't be 100% that this is the reason, but I truly feel it helped a ton,

I am going to try it again in the next 30 mins and also tomorrow morning when I wake up. I'll report back to see if this really helps, would be great to help fellow r/opiate broskies.

I've always had the problem of needing some sort of vice (gambling, video games, other substances, etc) to keep me busy. And when I was single, this was simple as my pursuit of the opposite sex always gave me something to do. Now that I'm married, I'm very happy with my wife (who is aware of my situation and is cool with it) so dropping her to chase tail isn't an option. Sometime soon we'll have kids and I will be too busy to indulge myself, so I'm looking for a medium term solution, one that either fills the void or fixes my sleep schedule.

My Current Situation:

* I'm a daily user of oxy in the 45mg (weekdays) to 90mg (weekends) range for over a year now. I've never upped the dose. I never do it work, and save it for evenings on weekdays. This way I ensure that I don't get any major physical withdrawal symptoms if I needed to stop suddenly. To facilitate this, I occasionally take a day or 2 off to ensure that I can. The only symptoms I experience is trouble concentrating and impatience. I get no other physical symptoms.

I want to stop for two reasons, but only the second makes it a worthwhile goal for me:

* It's expensive.

* More importantly, it messes with my sleep schedule. Normally, I have insomnia (which oxy helps), but with my usage, I have a whole lot of trouble waking up in the morning even if I get 8 hours of sleep. I need at least 10 hours before waking up comes with ease and my sleep deprivation goes away. Since I only get 8 hours of sleep on weekdays, I go into more and more sleep debt as the week progresses and then do my best to catch up on weekends, missing out on any potential weekend activities. This may be because oxy exacerbates my sleep apnea due to a deviated septum which I plan to address via a septoplasty soon. (It will clog both nostrils for 8 weeks so I will need to be able to fill that void some other way in that time.)

The easiest times for me to take occasional days off is when I go on vacation. I'm busy doing all sorts of activities that keep me busy and take my mind off of it. However, the last time I took 2 days off was at home and I felt this deafening silence and boredom that I had nothing to fill with. I want to stop while avoiding this silence. Things I've tried so far:

* Smoking weed. I currently do this at the end of the night to enhance the oxy sensation. I also use it as a replacement whenever I do take time off. The downside is that while the feeling is quite similar (for me), I get ridiculous munchies and end up eating waaay to much junk food. It also makes me more sensitive to cold weather, and this being the start of the cold season, hinders my enjoyment of being outside. I can (and have) done other illicit substances both for fun and as a replacement, but based on my reading it seems that opiates are least toxic (after weed) that can be done on a regular basis.

* Sports/physical activities. I have easy access to a gym at home and at work and play hours of ping-pong as well. However, as it starts to get colder, my options become more limited. I've just bought running sneakers to go running with my dog, but that only keeps me busy for so long. It may tire my body but my mind still races.

* TV/Surfing the internet. I currently do this whenever I'm home, but without it, it still fails to fill the gap.

* Other vices: Gambling/playing video games/sex with my wife keeps me only so busy. I've been addicted to video games in high school, so I can pick up a video game addiction to replace my substance one, but I'm not sure that's a step up. At least with my current situation, I still go out, hang with friends, etc. When I was addicted to Diablo 2, I never even did that much.

* Other activities like hanging out with friends, seeing a show or a movie/etc are only possible on some days, not all. And having to be home at certain times to take care of the dog doesn't facilitate daily outings either. I live in a big city, so camping/hiking/fishing aren't compatible with my work schedule.

So my question boils down to: How do you fill that void after you stop? What do you do to keep from falling back into the cycle? Or if you had similar experiences with your sleep schedule, how do you fix it such that you don't require additional sleep while taking opiates?

I am not trying to stop anyone from using, but rather better educate them into the darkness that opiate addiction is. First of all I would like to mention how fundamental endorphins are to our instinctual cravings. They have allowed us to live and survive longer for thousands of years through their natural occurrences in the brain.  It is in our physiology to adore opiates.  If you're like me, you have been fascinated with reading accounts of people being high. The main draw being the indescribable euphoria first time users experience. Then you also read of the horrors of addiction... But if you're like me you don't take the warning signs personally. I am begging you right now writing this that, please take this shit seriously. It will happen to you if you have ever had any emotional issues and use! I know if you're like me, than no matter what I say you are still going to try it.  My heart hurts so bad for all of these young adults across the world that have fallen into this addiction.  Please believe me when I tell you it can happen to you.  I have yet to encounter an addict yet who didn't wish with all the world that they could go back to that first day they picked up and redo it.  You CAN get addicted from using just once; don't let any rationalization convince you otherwise. Addiction will drag you to lower points than you can ever imagine. I get so much emotional pain when I recall the way I acted during active addiction. This shit will take over your brain guys I promise. It makes you feel incredible, don't get me wrong, but I promise you it is never worth it. If you enjoy any aspects of your soul ex out this page and never look back. Please, I beg of you.

3uqav8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3uqav8/so_im_thinking_about_getting_on_suboxone/,7,https://redd.it/3uqav8,illumiNAUGHTYboi,So I'm thinking about getting on suboxone maintenance program.,"I had over a year clean doing 12 step stuff before I relapsed but I've been thru his cycle many, many times before.

I just want to try subs because its the only thing I haven't (other than methadone). 

As far as the prescribing doctor goes I've heard that some require outpatient or AA/NA, some drug test, others don't, ect.

I've done outpatient so many times before that I really don't want to do that again, especially because of a short relapse (~3 weeks). 

When I call a doctors office will they be straight up with me about whether or not they require  outpatient? Because I don't want to waste the time and money of an appointment just to find out I don't want to make this doctor my prescribing physician.

Any info on subs/sub doctors would be much appreciated. I'm in the north end burbs Seattle if that makes any difference (I've hears it can be hard to find a doc because there are so many junkies lol).",1448816615.0
