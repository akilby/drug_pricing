Daily Kratom User,"So recently I've had the opportunity to try heroin, always wanted to try and recently been able to get it easilly.

I've tried it 4 times in the past month from doses ranging from .2g to .45g only up the nose, not going to try shooting it. Smoking seems not to work with ECP and not into putting it up my butt.

I'll always start out with really really tiny lines, doing like 5 of those over the course of 30 minutes to make sure it doesn't have fent and slowly making them bigger and bigger, waiting 20-30 minutes between lines.

I do get high off it but never nodding out or that super amazing feeling I've heard of.

I do take kratom every day and am around 5-12 grams.

It's not bad H either, someone overdosed on it but they were shooting and sounds like they did way to much w/o harm reduction.

I mean its alright but I always have to add some kratom to make it worth it. 60 bucks of kratom will last me 2-4 weeks and the H is gone in a few hours.

Is the Kratom affecting the tolerance for it? Can't find many reports of people trying H when on kratom and not using kratom to get off it.

Not planning on doing any more because I could see even 3 or 4 more times making it more and more addicting and I'm at a spot where I can walk away.

Edit: It's also easier to stop because I don't hangout with anyone who does H so I'm not really around it and told my dude not to text me about it and if I want any I'll hit him up",1454290833.0

He was unresponsive for a while the night before and his friends called the paramedics. He woke up for a while before they arrived and asked the paramedics to leave once they got there. Everyone thought he was fine at that point and they let him head off to sleep for the night. The next morning, they found him laying dead on his side.

I wish this were a joke. No one thinks you're going to OD from casual use. And no one ever thinks about ODing on PST. But it happened to him. He wasn't even opiate-naive. He'd used H here and there, and he took the occasional pill, but this still happened somehow. Maybe he'd been drinking a bit - maybe he had a condition - maybe he mixed with other drugs - who knows.

He was very young: 20, just getting on his feet after he was kicked out of his parents' house. He was a very genuine, honest guy, though a bit troubled... He was technically homeless (but he always had a place to stay, he had lots of friends) and he had serious family issues. But I wouldn't have traded his friendship for the world. I'll miss him a lot.

I don't want to get on a high horse or act like I can give harm reduction advice. But I guess everyone should try to remember that weird stuff happens and this is one example of the type of weird event that drug use can expose you to. Maybe this will never happen to anyone else on earth. Some seeds are stronger than others...

The paramedics didn't even know what PST was.

After doing a bit of research I've come to know that these are the most faked blues, and are very hard to find now as well.  I was hoping to get your guys expert opinion on if these are real or not before I make a huge deal to my guy.  here is the rundown...

* light blue, almost white, with small specs of darker blue in them 
* imprints seem on point compared to pic found on [drugs.com](http://www.drugs.com/imprints/30-m-8232.html)
* everything seems good other than! when I have the pill with the M up and flip it towards me the score and 30 on the backside are at different locations on each pill.  Couldn't find much info on this, so I'm not sure if its normal. The info I did said thats the best way to know they are fakes.  I get scripted for klonopin and did the same test on those and the score on the back is at different location on those as well (may just be the way things are with round pills)...

Anyways I'll leave these pictures at the bottom and would love your guys input!!! would hate to start to no trust my guy as things are getting much harder to find nowaday!

* Got them my guy who usually only has blues every few months.  Mostly has narcos. 
* Saw him remove them from a legit pharmacy bottle, didn't get to read name, info on the bottle.  
* He sources his stuff through his friend who I know has medical issues.  Don't know this guy personally but know he is 100% prescribed narcos, not sure if he is prescribed blues.
* I've seen the guy I get them from pop one in front of me
* lastly, the A 215 I got last time I can't pinpoint there validity...I took them while on vacation in a weed legal state so I was stoned off my fucking ass 24/7...

I prefer the gunpowder and I specifically ask for it but he gave me some fucking powder that isn't bunk but doesn't get me as high as the gunpowder. Whenever I try and get close to my ideal high, I always end up throwing up. I spent $200 this time and imo he dropped the ball. He KNOWS that I don't like powder but he gave it to me anyway. Another issue is that he's stupid and likes to meet up at spots where cops like to patrol because he's too lazy to go down a street and pick another has station. 

Then I have another connect who I've never met or been to, but I know the middleman pretty well. The dope is supposedly fire, the actual dealer is professional, but the middleman isn't always available, the spot is soooooo far from my house like 45 minutes to an hour, the price is more expensive ($140/g), and Ive never actually tried it for myself.

So it's been a tough past few days of me tapering down and trying to go on subs til payday Thursday. Started Friday, got a small front Saturday to tide me over. Took a sub Sunday and pawned the last of ANY valuables I have with me right now just for another shot to soothe the induction yesterday and get me in to work today without complete misery (besides my baseline lack of enthusiasm). I didn't have any left for this morning, though, so today was a little rough. Thankfully the Bunavail helped me at least feel well. 

So one of my guys who I owe money to promised me a sample late Saturday ""by 12 (noon) Sunday at the latest."" Dude is notoriously awful with time. I just scored my G at midnight right now, so there you go. And you know how it is, can't be too ""annoying"" with people in general, let alone when the guy is delivering you a SMALL amount of FREE shit. And man I can't tell you the sweet amazing relief I feel. I've gone longer without shit but this process has really been going on since Friday. The tapering and looming doom of withdrawal has been hanging over me all weekend, and now I finally have something to keep me nice and get me through the morning tomorrow. I'm writing that line so I HAVE TO SAVE SOME! Lol. And damn, shit is fire, too. Not his usual junk. Needless to say, this makes me very happy and I just feel the need to share it with you all. All of the whining and waiting is finally over and will help bridge me until Thursday (well, sort of, I only have half of the G, the other half I split with my bf & I gave him a lil extra for some cottons earlier and serious spoon scraping lol). I mean I'm already in a few bags with this guy and he didn't have to throw us a sample so I'm pretty happy when things like this happen. And shit needs to seriously wind down soon so these moments are going to be less and less going forward...trying to enjoy it while it lasts.

The weather here is god awful at the moment. A few trees have been up rooted etc and his guy stays on the out side of town in the next village over from me .

 The amount of custom he lost in those few hours was unreal the buzzer never seemed to stop . Most just went else where but a few came up and waited there where about 8 of us all waiting in his house for his guy to turn up . He eventually came at about 8:45 when he was ment to be at his place for 6:30pm .

The kit is the same dark H he had a few days ago you don't really get a good rush from it but it has great legs and lasts at least 10 hours . He let me do a charge in his toilet as his missus had went out for something and he asked me for a clean set of tools that I reluctantly gave him as the other week I stayed at his bit and he had a hit and nearly OD and that was only on one third of the barrel that  he managed to push in before gouching out . He also told me he had to go to the docs as it started turning into an absese as he had to go into his legs as he had fucked all the veins in his arms from years of IVing and not having a good technique.


   I had biked it into town earlier in the day but it was now dark and windy as fuck so he offered me my bus fare and I put my bike in his spare room . Got to the bus stop and a bus came with in a couple f minutes 😊 Result ! Got home had another hit & now I'm happy as Larry . Got my ladies watered and now I'll probably down load a film and chill . I've to pick up about 120ml of done in the morning so that will keep me going till Wednesday . 
     Hope every one is good and your not rattling ( WD) if youre not trying to come off ,happy nods everyone 😊

Edit : For the lazy fucks ! That have the attention span of a goldfish - Had to wait 5 hours in my dealers house till he re-upped as I was getting tick till Wednesday .

I bought 10 30mg oxys and received:

* 7x [M-Box /  30] (http://www.drugs.com/imprints/30-m-8232.html)

When I got them I was a concerned about the M-Boxes.  They appeared white to me.  Well, after getting out of my car and going to my apartment, I did a bit of research.  People said the M's may be a very light blue. Under a direct light, I compared the M's against a pure white K-Pin 2MG (Roche).  The M's where certainly very light blue and not pure white.

I had taken 3 M's orally and they certainly tasted what I expected and are giving me the desired opiate affect  (I did take 0.25mg Suboxone  8 hours beforehand).  So I think they're legit.

I don't think being given several types of OC30s, that they would have come from a press factory.  I'm satisfied.

I finally sent out the last one like an hour ago when I went to get cigarettes, plopped that bad boy in the mail box outside 711. So to those who have been waiting I AM SORRY!!!! I got SO many more requests than expected for rigs, and weirdly only one request for narc. But I had to hit the pharmacy and cope center again to get the right kinds for a few certain people... Like IM rigs, never used em before had no idea to explain them so waited til I was with my friend who does to go in the pharmacy and use the voucher to get em since he knew exactly how to order them._**




* Again... I am SOOOOOO sorry it's taken me a while to send them all out but it was way more people and way more expensive that I thought it'd be. I am not complaing, just explaining the delay. I even had one amazing person send me some liquid awesomeness for helping him out, so things like that make it something I love doing for people and I get to see contrary to popular belief, junkies are not all scum bags. Yes some are shit stains and some are scum of the earth but some of them are the most amazing genuine people EVER. I like to think I'm a cool junkie myself, lol oh man.. I sound stupid.




Sorry for the wall of shit I did the rest of that coke and it woke me up from the nod of a lifetime so now here I am reddditing like a mofo. 
I love you all and am not being sappy but thanks for the cool people who really do look out for eachother and are not in this strictly for themselves. I love my opi-friends <3 <3 lovelovelove

I was really active here about 5/6 years ago, met people IRL, blah blah blah. Anyway, I'll just copy and paste this, any help would be really appreciated:

So I've been on methadone a little over a year, I was getting a weeks worth of takehomes, and suddenly that stopped and I had to start coming in every day. I had a drug test where I tested positive for methadone, its metabolite, and nothing else, except my creatine was at 16 mg/ml and 20 is the cut off.

 I haven't failed a drug test since my first two, so my counselor played detective to see if I was up to something, but she believed me and said I would get my takehomes back in a month. 

Well it happened again today. I got a test with 18.4 mg/ml. I looked through the previous tests on her computer and I've had 21(just above the cut off) 70's, 150's, all over the board. The only thing that might have changed is that I was taking antibiotics for an abscess in my tooth. Also since my teeth are so messed up, It's hard for me to drink anything but water so I drink a lot of it. They suggested UTI and kidney problems, but anti-biotics would have cleared up the UTI if I had one and I don't have insurance so I can't get my kidneys checked out. I pay $114 a week to this place, and I'd rather be paying that money and coming once a week so I don't have to deal with them. It's a pain in the ass working nights and then getting there before they close at 11:30 and 9:00AM on weekends. It's also open Sundays so I never get to sleep anymore. It's just screwing up my life going everyday again.

 How can I get my creatine levels up? I can't afford to at a lot of meat. I thought about the capsules but I'm not sure if they would just pass right through me. B vitamins was a thought but does that just make your urine more yellow? I have whey protein in my closet from back when I used to work out, now that I think about it I'm pretty sure it also has creatine, would that help? This is all really frustrating since I really am not doing anything wrong. It was terrible trying to explain to my wife I failed a drug test....for water.

Anyway, sorry, as you can imagine I'm frustrated so that turned into a little rant so

TLDR; I keep failing drug tests for dilute when I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary, how can I stop this by getting my creatine up. Preferably cheaply.

The doctor seemed to downplay the severity of the problem, but treated me with a one-week course of antibiotics and advised me to apply warm compresses.

I've finished my antibiotics, but the bump is still there and pretty much the exact same size. It no longer hurts at all and is no longer discolored as it had been, but I still have this lump on my arm.

Here are some pictures of before and after.

Went through like 800mg total. Have never done opiates like this before. Every other time I did opiates I did one dose and that was it. 

Any tips on surviving withdrawals? I've never really felt withdrawals before. I still have 300mg left so I was thinking of tapering off. Any tips on how to do this? Any idea how I will feel over the next couple days? I'm kinda scared. 

I also have phenibut, tianeptine, and ibuprofen available , I heard that these can help. 

I did this because I was always curious to how people get addicted to opiates and I totally understand now. I have also wondered how bad withdrawals can be, so I guess that is what I will find out over the next couple days.

Thanks for the help. Let me know if you need any more info from me.

my wings were all bloody and i now knew the truth

the gold I saw was the weight to ground me

there's people all around you, and their love is your wings.

How do you not get the cops involved?,"For opiate/opioid users in the US, how do you call 911 without getting the cops involved? Here is my plan (hopefully that I will never have to use): Call 911, tell them that someone you are with has had an opiate/opioid overdose, give them a fake name and give them the nearest usable address that is not your own (local gas station, a foreclosed home, or even a neighbor's house). Is that a bad idea? If that was a bad idea, what about this one: Call 911, tell them that you feel like you are getting a heart attack and then when the ambulance arrives, tell the paramedics that your friend OD'd on (whatever opiate/opiod). The reasoning behind this is that the 911 operator does not dispatch the police as well. Good or bad idea? One of my friends called 911 because his friend OD'd on heroin and told the 911 operator that his friend OD'd on heroin. Guess who showed up before the actual ambulance? The cops. That is not fair if the cops show up for a medical emergency. My friend said the cops made things worse. What do you do? Do you tell the 911 operator about the OD or not? I feel like if you do not tell them about the OD, then they won't bring the naltrexone (opiate agonist) to save the person's life. Does anyone have a full proof emergency plan when shit happens?

So I just watched that video, where a guy overdoses and the people attending him give him chest compressions and that's it. I want to say in most overdose cases especially if you are there when they begin to overdose you only need to give rescue breaths and just continue doing them until the person wakes up. Of course you continually check pulse and give chest compressions when the heart stops but this won't happen to most people if you start rescue breaths immediately. So next time a person overdoses don't start sternum rubs and pounding their chest in. If you feel a pulse give rescue breaths. At the supervised injection site in my city Ive watched people overdose all day it's crazy. I have never seen a single person even need narcan or chest compressions. They just put an oxygen tank on you and wait for you to wake up. Because usually it's just the breathing that depresses sometimes to the point of brain death then your heart stops beating. So yeah, in overdose situation call an ambulance, check their pulse and start rescue breaths if you feel one if you don't feel one then you can start compressions as well as rescue breaths. But I bet most times the person will just need rescue breaths until they either wake up or narcan is administered.",1454541282.0

I've been using opiates off and on for 7 years now (3 of them being codeine, so I'm not sure whether to count that). Last year I got into a proper H addiction but managed to quit after ~6 months. After quitting I got very depressed for around 4 months so decided to get drugs back as a New Year's resolution.

However I got a bunch of IV needles, before I was IMing for about a year or so. The only opiates I used were Morphine and Fu-F IV but I've used stims and dissociatives quite a lot (IV).

I don't want to be getting into a major opioid habit any time soon, chipping certainly but not constant. However this IV use has taken it's toll on my arms. For a few weeks I would hit the vein every single time but lately I *cannot* find them. I keep on trying but I guess my veins must be fairly damaged so this morning I shot into my foot.

I was wondering how long it would take for my veins to heal and if IVing anywhere besides the arm is quite a big leap? I'm not currently addicted to anything besides alcohol and cigarettes but the foot seems like it could lead into proper use again, plus the added bonus of the rush that IV gives. 

I don't want to start constantly IVing but I also don't want to stop. Ethically (and of my point of view currently), what do you think I should do? ",1454520734.0

Sara.","****The names of the people in these stories have been changed. Not to protect the innocent, there are no innocent people in my stories***

**Sara**

Her name was Sara. She was from New York. She had just moved down here to Florida because her dad went to prison and had nowhere to stay, so her and mother was staying with her Uncle. The first time i met her she was nervous, even though she was with her boyfriend, but it was understandable. Eventually her boyfriend had to move back to New York, so it was usually just her or her and mother that came. They would snort the pill right in the car as soon as i handed it to them, other than that they tried to not look like junkies. Using brand new straws, and if i mentioned a dollar bill they acted like it was the most disgusting thing in the world.

After about a year of meeting her, my gf ended up meeting her, and they became good friends. We even had a threesome once. Soon after she dropped out of college, and her doctor uncle stopped giving her money. So she ended up getting a job at a liquor store. For the first few weeks she would only get pills on payday. Then after about 2 months, she was getting them every couple days. About 2 weeks of her getting them every other day she completely stopped. She told us that she was supposed to be making bank drops, and she was fudging the paperwork and taking money out of the drops - and now the owner was getting suspicious. She got lucky that about a week later another employee was caught on camera stealing $20 from the register and liquor. He got blamed for it all. 

Soon after we had her over at my house, and she mustve seen where i put one of my blues (i was going to do it as soon as she left), but as soon as i went to get it when she left, it was gone. Then she didnt answer her phone - she never stops answering her phone. I didnt say anything.

She broke up with her bf because he was cheating on her in New York (i know right?) - im pretty sure this was just an excuse for her following actions. She told me this on the way to meet me - she lived about 30 minutes from me. I was over at my boys house and she said she wanted a couple - which i thought was weird because she usually says exactly how many she wants. She pulls up and i get in the car - first she started crying saying that it was fucked up that he cheated on her. I asked her if she felt bad that she slept with me and my girl - she said no because she always had a suspicion. She then said she didnt have any money today and wanted to know if there was another way to pay. I told her i would give her 1 for head, and 2 for fucking. She said she wanted to fuck. We did. She did this about once a week for a few weeks, and i always used a condom, even when she gave me head. Then one week i told her i wanted some head, and she said ok - i told her i didnt have a condom this time, but i would give her 3 if she swallowed. She said ok. She did. i got buckled up and as i was leaving the car i told her i knew she was stealing shit from me, and we are now even. She still tried to buy from me after that but i ignored her calls. Last i heard she was on backpage as a escort.

I haven't really been doing any opiates since i've been on methadone(120mg), but I recently ordered some U-47700 and it has a nice rush too it. I can still pass my drug tests and all.


 I gave some to my friend to try out. He used to be on 120mg of methadone a day for a bit over a year and recently went to rehab to get clean from it. He started doing a bit of dope again, usually like a 0.4 or 0.5, so i gave him 30mg of this stuff. I guess that was way too much. He got mad high really fast and started nodding out within 10 seconds. by 15 seconds he was totally out, lips turning blue. He fell out of his chair like dead weight, and i immediatly gave him 1cc of IM naloxone. I was afraid it wouldn't work because this is a research chemical and not much is known about it, so I screamed for help to my roommate who doesn't know about my usage. He was pretty freaked out, but he helped me carry him out to the car. 


After about 5 or 10 mins after I had given him the narcan, and 
right as im about to put him in the car to take him to the ER, he wakes up. He literally went from being completely dead to standing on his feet within 5 seconds. I don't know if I have ever been so scared. being all alone with my friend and being the only one who can save his life.

This is my first time posting anything, but I'm in a shitty situation that I'm pretty fucking unsure of how to fix. After lurkin' around on here for a few months now I felt this is the best if not only place I can get some actually real and decent advice.

So here it is: I've been with my girl for 3 years now, we both use H. I'm between jobs right now, but actively looking for another job. Needless to say I'm broke as a fuuucking joke, and my girl is basically supporting my habit atm. Whatta gal I know right? She's fucking great. My trailer park queen if you will. 

Well here's the problem. Being on dope my sex drive is....isn't. While my tpq's need's for intimacy seems to be COMPLETELY unaffected. Well not only is she frustrated (understandably) that I'm not layin down some peter much these days, she thinks that I just dont want to lay ol' pete down for only her and that I'm just using her for drugs and shit now.

The first year and a half or so we were together we didn't use and I've tried pointing that out, the fact I was interested before dope was even in the picture. I've also tried explaining that when I was working and making my own money I still chose to be with her. I should mention that I normally would do a little shards to overcome this problem, but I just can't do that stuff anymore as it started to not even help me with that anymore not to mention I just generally don't care much for that drug cause it's gross and makes me feel more like shit than good. 

Obviously I need to get on my grind to start supporting myself to at least relieve some tention from the situation, and I'm workin on it. I can just tell she's on the verge of telling me to kick rocks and I...ah fuck I don't know I just don't want that to happen, I love the woman. What do you guys think? Any advice you guys have to offer is much appreciated. If not thanks for at least listening to me piss and moan.

I unfortunetly only have a few methadone(2 10mgs) but I did grab a half gram of heroin. I take 8mgs a day, but I have been skipping alot of days sometimes going 2-3 without dosing. The last week I have gotten down to 4 and then im going to start at 2mgs. I have been on subs 6+ months, which blows. The thought of taking a shit, that doesnt feel like rocks and come once a week is heaven. Suboxone has lowered my drive, my T and made me lethargic ect. 

So here is the plan, how long will I have to wait to even remotely feel the H? Within 5 days of last Sub I figure snorting wont even have an effect, but I refuse to shoot because anyone who shoots knows its a matter of hours after your last shot that the wds come for you. I would like to catch a little buzz of the H, and I say this because I am done with Opiates, I know im done, I will not fuck with them, I have reached the point where going down that road is not ever going to happen. Lets call it a last hoorah before I check out.

 The problem is obviously a full time job wont feasably allow a suboxone withdrawl, as i turn into an anxiety riden psycho. So day 1 no subs, hoperfully make it to day 5 or so, start the h only doing that to catch a  buzz while getting rid of withdrawls. Then boom split my 2 domes in half maybe 1/4s and get through the next 4-8 days. This should get me to 12-14 days, getting past the RLS and massive anxiety.",1454630288.0

I've been lurking for a long time on my other account, opiates are not my thing, i'm a stims type of gal! I'm hoping to get some advice, sorry if the text gets a little long.

A couple days ago my mum got prescribed cocillana (swedish cough syrup with morphine), and I've always been curious about opiates, hence I lurk here, so of course I had some. Around 50mg which is an good dose for a small framed person with 0 tolerance according to most. 

It felt great, until I started feeling very sick and almost threw up inside a store. The next day I had only 10mg (max dose for someone with cough, you take that 4 times a day though) and I barely felt it, but the little sensation I got was nice. That evening I took some more to feel nice before going to sleep

My mum is not using the medicine anymore and I can easily take more if I wanted, but my question is should I? I find it difficult to think that I'll go purchase more opiates after the bottle's empty, so should I finish this bottle and then go back to my stims or what? I'm asking for honest advice? 

IMO I don't have an addictive personality, I use stims when I go out because I hate alcohol. What do you think?

what was the drug? i think it started with an E. Etonitazene maybe?


any stories about super heavy addiction (exotic) would be cool too.

edit: here is the story i was referring to so eveyone doesnt have to search through the comments

>Thomas Highsmith worked at a prestigious laboratory in Salt Lake City designing low-friction laminates for high-performance skis. In 2003, he started spending long nights in his lab secretly manufacturing a personal supply of etonitazene. Shortly after completing the synthesis, he became hopelessly addicted. He would show up for work clutching a 12-ounce spray bottle of etonitazene and fiendishly snort it throughout the day. Over the course of a couple of months, his tolerance escalated to the point where he was taking 300 times his starting dose. A coworker became suspicious of Highsmith’s odd behavior and reported him to the police. His etonitazene supply was seized, and he was prescribed methadone to combat the withdrawal. At that point, his addiction equated to 500 bags of heroin a day, and the methadone umbrella did nothing to deflect the 10,000-pound etonitazene anvil hurtling toward his head. Highsmith never received a criminal sentence because he was found dead in his home before his first court date. The withdrawals were so severe that he had killed himself to escape the pain.


and heres a different one about a fentanyl

>A young Canadian guy made a post on an internet drug forum begging for help withdrawing from an unknown opioid he called pharaohfentanyl, a synthesis of a new fentanyl derivative that he claimed to be 4,000 times more potent than morphine—the strongest opioid a human had ever tasted. He was generally mocked and assumed to be a liar, but after asking around a bit, I’ve come to the conclusion that his story was probably true. Although his original intention had been to deal the drug on blotter paper, he started using and spent the next six months on a nonstop pharaohfentanyl binge. His dosage increased 675-fold, and by the end he was using amounts that would equate to 3,300 bags of heroin a day. His breath alone was strong enough to make someone nod. He destroyed his entire supply and quit cold turkey. Here is how he described the withdrawal: “I cannot feel my FACE! It’s like touching a brick wall. It feels like I took a bath in MENTHOL, my insides feel like ice… that will shift after a few seconds to MENOPAUSE-ESQUE INSANE hot flash like a wave of lava under my skin with profuse sweating… I’M SOOO WEAK AND SOOO TIRED AND SOOO DRAINED I JUST WANT IT TO GO AWAY RIGHT NOW!”",1454610970.0

Is 23G good? My main problem is below - I still have the bumps (no other symptoms) on the crooks of my arms from skin-popping after a week. Usually they disappear after a day at most.


**Here's my experience at pharmacies...*

Try 1) Walgreens - I explained that I need 25g 1cc needles for an uncle's IM injections and he denied me and said I need a prescription / insulin proof.

Try 2) Target - I asked for the same thing but the pharmacist said she only had 30g. Nothing else. Is that bullshit?

**My question:**

Do pharmacies stock 25G or lower insulin needles...?

I think I'm done with this. It's nerve-wracking getting denied / looked down upon by pharmacists since they know it's bullshit. I'm in a legal state too to buy...

Any websites where I can get cheap packs or boxes? I really need to not spend a lot on it.

Also I understand the danger of IM. It's just better than skin-popping at least (I skin-pop often since it's hard for me to hit the vein so i just do it and it works almost as well).

**ALSO:**

A week ago I went on a binge and skin popped. You know those bumps after missed shots that go away fairly quickly? Well **my bumps has stayed for over a week now** - and that seems unusual. No other symptoms though. Not even pain when I touch them. Is that an abscess or what? What's going on? Should I go to the hospital?

Let's say you normally take 300mg and for whatever reason on a particular day you happen to take 360mg because you happened to stay up longer than usual. So what would normally be 2 30mg pills every two hours X 5 times per day became the same amount adding 2 more pills and two more hours. My question is, even though that's an increase in the amount you normally do for the day do the pills you did HOURS ago (say up to your third dose for the day) have any effect on the extra two you're doing? Like is the total amount building up over the course of the day or is it more of a situation to where the pills you did way earlier in the the day have worn off and by the time you're getting ready to sleep you're only really dealing with your last dose or two 

Reason I ask is because lately I'Ve noticed whenever I do this I'm usually straight up nodding out by the end of the night. Fighting hard as hell to keep myself awake.My question is am I nodding so hard for the more obvious reason which is staying up later than normal= being tired. Or am I nodding because I went a little over, my already high, normal total daily intake and my fear of having to stay awake long enough to not feel the effects so I'm not risking falling asleep and not waking up. As it is I deal with a lot of obsessive thoughts and anxiety so something most people wouldn't even think of is, in my mind, the thing that's going to kill me that particular day. 

Before I get a shitload of ""stop doing them then"" ""you're going to die dude!!!"" ""you need to bring your dosage down"" or whatever else doesn't have anything to do with the actual question at hand. Let's try and get an answer for this question because I've googled this question quite a few times recently in as many ways as I can word it and haven't really seen it answered...

There's nothing else drug related in the vehicle. The cops showed up to document the accident, but I acted straight and no sobriety test or breathalyzer was given. I refused medical attention bc I came away healthy besides a stiff kneck. 
And everything else was non eventful and never got questioned about drugs or anything of that nature. The wrecker company loaded up my vehicle and towed it away to their lot so an adjuster can look at it Monday morning.

I've been lurking for months.. But the past few days I've had, I feel like I need to drop my story, and possibly hear some others stories if any of you feel so inclined..

So, I've been using, IV, for about 6.5 years. I began IV, I'm that weird 5% of us that didn't begin with pain killers. I had a personal tragedy (my best friend/boyfriend of 4 years took his life via shotgun, in our living room, and I just couldn't hack that shit sober) anyway, after a year, I began to date someone new.. He turned out to be a real shitty boyfriend. Beside a particular day, that I gave him $60 dollars to cop for us, and bring my 2 to work.. In which he lied, told me he was pulled over and ""had to eat our bags"" .. Also went as far as telling me it was MY fault he was pulled over, because I sent him to cop.. Feeling awful that I ""sent him"" (wtf) I stole $100 dollars from work, made up an elaborate lie to leave work, and went to get us well. He threw a hissy fit, demanding 2.5 of the 5 bags I got for us, and the girl middle manning for us, just couldn't take it and blurted out that he had actually done the 4 bags from earlier in the day !! This is one example of being scumbagged by him countless times. His final ""fuck me over"" came after I held him down during a prison bid, and 2 weeks after he came home, he literally just stopped talking to me, to be with a new girl. 

Flash forward about 2 years. And recently, we have tried to become friends again. Last week, he stole the FIFTH flatscreen from his dad, and was kicked out of where he was staying. So, I let him stay with me. For the last 7 days, I fed him, he smoked my cigs, and I kept him well. also for these 7 days, I have been ""training"" for my new job (I'm a bartender) however training means you walk with no cash, so it's been rough. Getting 2 bags, and giving 1 up, is fucking hard, but I didn't want to leave him sick, and though I wasn't where I needed to be, I wasn't completely ill.. 
So on day 7, his dad let him come back home. I had one bag for the day, but was on a double, so I decided I'd work my first shift illin' and do my bag on my break. Good lord self control is almost impossible, but I did it !! 
I came home on my break, to find my bag, GONE. He had ""forgotten his phone"" when we were leaving my house in the morning, so I gave him my keys to run back in the house.
To add insult, I was irate, and hysterical when I recognized he had stolen my only bag, but he had blocked me from Facebook, texts, and calling ! 
It's not like he stole one of 2 bags, OR as if he had a god damn thing to do beside lay in his fucking bed ! 

About 15 min ago, he had the audacity to tell me ""at least I don't feel as sick as he does"" 
What. The. Actual. Fuck ?! 

I know it's ""part of the game"" to get beat, but personally, I've never done so. 
And yeah, I was dope sick, but the violation I felt was like a million times worse. 
I know the way he treated me when he was my boyfriend was an indication that he's just one of those people that heron takes their ability to be a human being. And you could probably say I might have deserved it, being so naive ? 

Furthermore, and on sort of an unrelated topic, I'm averaging about 15-20 min to hit a vein lately. I'm ending up looking as if I'm giving myself an autopsy, and literally crying, because I'm so sick that I just need a god damn vein to cooperate ! 
Any of you pretty ladies feel my pain ? I'm so jealous of the freakin roped guys have for veins. 
Ps. I have this sick thing, where I find myself looking at strangers arms and hands, thinking ""shit, I could hit that from here""!

**Megan:**

Megan was one of my older customers. She was probably in her 50's, married with 2 kids. Her older son was 17 and her daughter was 14-ish. Her husband was a CFO for some big company and easily pulled in over a 250k a year. She used to be a nurse, but now she stayed at home. When i first met her, she caught me off guard, because she wanted 30 blues. Most people don't start off with that many, but get a small amount then move up. Me and my boy took some extra precautions, but we made the deal and everything went fine.

She would come almost once a week, and get between 30-50 every week. One of my best customers. Then one day my phone rang from her number. I answered it and girl answered but it wasn't her. It was a younger girl, and she said my name (not last name), and said that if i deal with her mom again, she was calling the cops. Not really worried because her mom didn't know where me or my boy lived - i told her okay. A few hours later i got another call from a unknown number - it was Megan - she said her sons girlfriend got ahold of her phone, and started going through the text messages and read some of them that we had. She said she bought a burner phone, and she was only going to contact me through that, and that if the other number called, to not answer it.

She still came to see me one a week or so, but i started to realize that not everything she said was 100% true and some of the things she said were very hard to believe. About 6 months after first meeting her, she said she separated from her husband (she said she couldn't get a divorce because they were Catholic), and she got a large alimony check from him. A few weeks after that, she said she went on a date with a younger guy, and on the way home from dinner, they crashed and he died - and she was meeting me this same night. Now normally when someone does this, there is some type of incentive, but i didn't see any, so i found them plausible.

Another one of her stories was her best friend was a huge xanax addict, so she had to start getting xanax with the blues. This one i could see that she didnt want to say she needed xanax too, but i wasn't sure. Soon after, she also crashed her car 4-5 times, but blamed that on nodding out from the blues, deers, and other misc. stuff. Then one day she said her friend OD'ed and died from the xanax - but she still bought xanax after that - i didn't say anything.

One day she called me and said that my local police department had been looking into me and my boy dealing - i asked her how she knew, and she said she has a ""friend"" thats on the force and tipped her off. Since she only knows my first name, and doesnt know my boys name and had only seen him once or twice - i found that unbelievable too - but still something that hung in the back of my mind. A few days later, i got a email to the email address i use for talking to my customers, and it was her sons girlfriend again. She said she knows that Megan has still been meeting me, because she put a GPS tracking app on the phone, and had been keeping track. This time she showed me a Google Map that had exactly where we had been a few days before. I told Megan and told her not to call me again.

Megan said that she got another burner phone. I told her i didnt care, and i was out of the game. Later that day i was walking in my neighborhood, waiting for another customer to pick me up, and i see her car. This pissed me off because i told her to not call me - so instead she drove a hour to come visit me. She said she wanted to grab 50 blues one last time. I told her to wait, i got to call my guy. I walked away from her car and called my other customer - she was 15 minutes away. I told her i was going to text her a address to come to, and she didnt have to pick me up.

I got in Megans car, and we headed towards my boys apartment complex. On the way she handed me the $1400 for the pills. My other customer texted me that she was already there - perfect. She also told me on the way, that she thinks her sons gf hacked her laptop and mightve been emailing a detective, and that i should take some extra precautions. I was thinking the same thing. We pulled up, i walked to my boys apartment complex, and since i never park near his apartment, it took me a few minutes to get to it, and i told my other customer that i was there. I went up, grabbed the blues for my other customer, and a few for myself. Came down, got in my other customers car, and drove to walmart.

Normally it dont take no longer than 10 minutes in my boys apartment - so she called me right before i got to walmart, because it had already been 20 minutes. I told her that i was destroying this phone, getting a new one, and she wasnt getting the number, and that i told her to not call me, and she showed up in my neighborhood. She asked if i had the blues. I told her i wasnt getting them, and i was using the money to take precautionary steps, just in case there was a police case. She said that she would give me more money if i got her 25 more. I told her to go to a certain park and at the park was a big oak tree and to put the money in a envelope and put it where the trunks started branching off, which was about 5 foot up, and come back 20 minutes later. I was sitting across the street at the pizza place, so i watched her do it, drive off, and i grabbed the money, put the 25 blues in its place, and went back to the pizza place. She grabbed the blues and left.

She tried emailing me, but i autoforwarded all her emails to trash. One of my boys friends said that if i wanted to sell her (give him her number to deal with her), that he would deal with her. So for $100 i sold her to him. He said she came out 4-5 times and got bunch like she used to, but after that she got less and less where eventually she was only coming out for 1-2. We think that she went through all the money her husband gave her. I stopped talking to him, so im not sure what happened to her.

I would post it to r/relationships but since it is opiates related I figured it would make more sense here. I will try to make it as unbiased as possible but since it is only my POV it will have some bias probably.

So we have been married for less than a year and together for about 2 years now. She has stuck with me through all the shit I have put her through. About a year ago she was clean or trying to be and I was going to university an hour away which just so happens to be in the city we get our dope. I was skipping class and getting high or trying to because that stuff was so badly stepped on snorting a gram did nothing. She even texted me one day as I am sitting in this parking lot snorting lines saying that she is so happy we are clean and that she is proud of me going to class and doing well. Not too long after she found out I had been lying. So obviously I have not been the best boyfriend/husband. I have never cheated on her though. The only times I have lied to her have been about heroin.

Anyways, on to now a days, and my stupid dilemma. We are both addicted, having to use daily to stave off withdrawals. I want to quit because I want to know what it is like to have money again. She says she wants to quit but when the opportunity is there she finds some reason as to not want to. Basically the one more time thing. And since she did put up with me doing that to her for at least a month I figure I might as well go along plus, I am a junkie. 

We like to take turns making the one hour drive down and back, but quite often she wants to go twice in a row or more. And months ago I went twice in a row a couple times so some times I will let it slide whatever. It really isn't a big deal unless we are sick. Well recently we had a blizzard and she told me to drive because there was a foot of snow on the ground and she isn't comfortable driving the SUV in 4 wheel drive. So 2 days in a row I drove down BTW it sucked the windshield wouldn't stay clear. But anyways she drove the suv one day as the snow was mostly gone. Swore up and down she didn't do a shot right after getting the stuff. I wouldn't have had a problem because I have done a line every now and then after picking up when we're sick. But she told me tons of times she didn't do a shot. Well I drive the suv the next day and there is blood on the seat plus bloody cotton balls on the floor board. I ask her about it but she says she didn't do it. Whatever I wouldn't have cared if she did it just don't lie. 

Well everytime she comes back since we start shooting she goes straight to the bathroom and starts getting her shot ready first. Everytime I come back she asks for the bag so she can go to the bathroom and make her shot first. She always gets to hold the bag. She always decides the amount we each get. Recently, it seems that she is giving herself more. Like a decent amount more. Just now she pulled some out I put 80 units of water in of a 1cc needle and I get this very light tan almost clear shot. She put in enough water to fill two syringes and they were dark brown. If I mention it to her that hers are darker, I am the junkie just being a junkie. I have never gotten to decide how much we get to do or how much goes in my shot. It just seems like she is being unfair and there is no way I can convince her of it. 

Another weird thing happened about a week ago. We were sleeping or so I thought, but I woke up, noticed she wasn't there, and looked around. She just so happened to stumble out of the bathroom at that moment stuffing shit in her hoodie pockets. I didn't think much of it and rolled over and went to sleep. Well then she goes outside to ""smoke"" and is out there for at least 15 minutes which is unusual for her. The thought of her making and doing a shot while I was sleeping crossed my mind, but that's not like her to be sneaky or she wouldn't usually do that. Well then the next day I wear the same hoodie and there's a syringe in the pocket.

Am I being a paranoid junkie or is there something else going on? What would you do in my situation? BTW I let her slide with stuff like picking up, making her shit first, doing herself before letting me make mine, and holding the bag because I feel like it's a way to make up for the shit I have put her through and because I sometimes need help hitting my veins so I don't want to piss off the person who is going to stick a needle in my arm.

Noone will read this, but if you do, send me some advice. Sorry for the shit post, and I know this would fit better in relationships.

TLDR: I was shitty to my wife. To make up for it I let her hold the bag and take care of herself first so she will be nice when sticking me. She seems like she is becoming shady and being shitty to me but I might just be imagining things as a junkie. Send help.",1454727625.0

**Kevin**

Most of the people i deal with aren't the typical junkie you would see on TV that don't have a job, homeless, etc - but most of the people i deal with are functioning addicts that have a job, or has someone that supports their habit. When i first met Kevin he had a job at the grocery store, and when i picked him up, he still had his green work shirt on. My gf was with me at the time, and the city i picked him up at was the same city my connect was at. So before i picked him up, we discussed that he was getting 8 and giving me 1. We made the deal, and i snorted mine right i the car, and he said he was waiting to get home.

A met up with him a few more times, and everytime he said he was waiting to get home to do it - so this time i asked how he did it - hesitant at first, he said he shoots it. I asked if he had any clean syringes, because the only reason i don't, is because i didn't have any clean syringes. I could tell he felt less tense now that he didn't have to feel embarrassed about shooting them and said he had some at his house. Normally i would drop him off on a street, and never seeing his house, but this time i pulled up to his house and he told me this was one of his family members' house, and that he would be gone for a few hours. We went up to his bedroom, and we both shot our pills. I stayed for another 15 minutes or so and went home.

I would meet up with him on and off, he said he had another connect, but he didn't like to meet up with him, because it was in the hood, and he always thought he was going to get robbed or arrested going there. I picked him up one day and he was in his work clothes again - he said he left work because he was shooting up in the bathroom, and a customer opened the door and saw him, then told his manager. He managed to hide all his stuff, and when the manager went through his locker and stuff, didn't manage to find anything - but he had to take a piss test now. He said he wasn't going back because there is no way he would pass. He said he wanted to get high, but since it was still a few days from payday, he had to come up with some money. He went home, grabbed a bag of stuff and we headed to the pawn shop. Most of the stuff managed to get him $40. But he also had a gold chain, the first 2 pawn shops did their gold scratch test, and told him it was plated gold. We went to a third shop, and instead of scratching it, they put it in a machine, and the machine said it was gold. They gave him $200 for it.

We met my guy and got 10 blues, he gave me 2 for driving him around and all the bullshit. The part of town he lived at was sparsely populated, and had a bunch of houses that had a bunch of land, so we looked for a good spot to shoot up at - we finally found a big orange orchard, and pulled the car into it, and hid and shot our pills. We sat their for probably an hour just high as hell talking and itching and basically just enjoying the high.

For about 2 months i would pick him up, and since i didn't really have much money either, we would try to figure out ways to make money to get pills, then shoot them at the orange orchard. Towards the end he was stealing stuff from his family members, and one day he said that they raided his room and found his syringes, and are were putting in a outpatient program and he had to go to NA classes. About a week later, he called me and told me to pick him up from NA. I did and he said he sold his suboxone to someone at NA and he wanted to get high. Feeling bad, i asked him if he was sure, and said he definitely was. We got a few pills and got high.

I didn't hear from him for awhile after that - he messaged me on Facebook about 2 weeks later, and said he went into in-patient rehab. He completed rehab, and he hasn't called me since. Today he sent me a message on Facebook. He said he had to unfriend me, because he said even though hes been clean for a year, he wanted to separate himself from that lifestyle - i told him i understood, and if i ever get completely away from it all, i would friend request him again.

***Sorry if this isnt exciting as the first one - ill have another one up tonight that i think will be a little more exciting, the only reason i put this one up is because he messaged me today.***

Going out on a limb, I'd guess most users on this sub have OD'd at least once, if not more than once, myself included in the latter category. We live dangerous, unglamorous lives, strung about by and strung out on opiates.

When I first heard /u/yeaheroin had passed, I was as upset as anyone might be at the passing of an acquaintance. While I never knew him well, he was still part of the community. He was a contributing and involved member, taken early and suddenly. I was upset, but the worst of it only hit me later (at work, as luck might have it). How many times might I've been in his shoes, right on the edge of death, unknowingly with one foot on either side of existence, foil in one hand and a forgotten cigarette burning away in the other, nodding off once again as many times before?

Why have I continued after experiencing firsthand the danger and destruction of heroin? I was forced out of university after fentanyl dropped me to the floor, rushed to the hospital and brought back from the edge, and yet here I am still, restlessly waiting for the mail truck to pull around the corner to deliver my dope, end my listless, sick existence for a brief reprieve of calm and temporary joy.

When we lose a member of our community, whether they be a pillar of it, like our team of mods, or a quiet observer, one of thousands of people drifting in and out of the sub–we can't help but see ourselves in their place, in their shoes, sharing their fate.

I can't speak for all you here, /r/opiates, but all it does is make me want to use more. The more people the drug takes, and the more destruction it creates, the more I hate it, and yet the more I crave it as well. The first thing I wanted to do when I heard he'd passed was drag out a stamp and rail it.

I don't know why I'm like this–why we're like this–but please please for the love of God be safe. Tragedy spawns more tragedy–suicides cause suicides, overdoses cause overdoses, and so on. Please be safe tonight and every night. Every loss hurts.

I'll start,"So I was in the army for a bit, about 6 years. I, as well as many others in this profession, ended up having a fucked up back. Herniated disks, degenerative disk disease, and some other shit I can't even pronounce. I was put on percocet 5's and after the first few bottles I started to eat the whole scrip in a week, then it only took a few days to kill the bottle. I then found someone who would get (I don't know how) vicoprophen 10's at the beginning of the month then vicoden 10's a few weeks later, I'm guessing had her own script and bought another person's. Me and a friend would buy pretty much the whole bottle when she got it and split it, he also had the same script as me, so we had pills 24/7. 
Well one day I was moving some tool boxes and fucked my back up. Didn't think much of it, but when I layed down to go to sleep that night it hurt whenever my body would relax. So I decided fuck this and went to the er. The doc asked if I was taking meds, told her about the percs and how they aren't helping with whatever I did to myself. She says OK, the nurse will be back with some shots and you should be good to go, and asked if I drove there. Which I did. But I told her I didn't and that my squad leader drove me - this is where I fucked up. She says OK and a few minutes later the nurse comes in, gives me 2 shots in my ass, and says were gonna watch you for a few minutes and you can leave. I asked her what she gave me, she said fentenyl and morphine. Pretending not to be excited, I said ""oh ok"" and she walked out. Well 10 minutes later she walked in and asked how I was doing, I didn't feel anything and said fine. I was kind of disappointed, as I thought I'd be super faded. But they let me go and I jumped in my car and drove back to base. I ran up the stairs to the second story and went to my room, and started to make a milk shake as I hadn't eaten in like 8 hours... And then BAM. It hits me like a truck, I get tunnel vision and can barely walk let alone stay conscious and stumble to my bed and pass out, wake up a few hours later and enjoy being faded for the rest of the day. If it would have hit me while driving home, I would have ended up in a ditch, and I rarely wore my seat belt when traveling short distances, and I'm sure the doctors at the hospital would have given me more opiates and either killed me or would have had to give me narcan, which would be pretty terrible to be in withdrawal and fucked up from a wreck. 

Tl;dr: got morphine and fentenyl IM'd and the doc, said I had a ride but didn't and drove myself as it did not kick in yet. Didn't hit me till I got home, if it would have hit me I woulda wrecked and wasn't wearing my seat belt. But instead spent the day high as fuck.",1454826346.0

**Rob the robbers:**

[Story #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/44iknc/mm_stories_4_my_arrest/) was my story of how I got started selling crack. I actually dabbled in being an MM before that, but it was mostly just with weed, and maybe Lortabs or Xanax. I had a weed guy that lived across the street from me named Mark. He lived with his parents, but his parents smoked so they really didn't care much that he sold weed. He would get Xanax or Lortabs, and other stuff from time to time, but this was mostly from people that traded them for weed when it was a good deal.

Around Christmastime, my step-dad was working with a construction company that was from out of town. He found out that almost the whole company except for the higher management (no pun intended) smoked weed. He himself was a big pothead, but only knew people that stood on the corners that sold weed, and it was usually garbage - so he called me. He told me that his boss was going to call me and that he wanted some weed, but he wasn't sure how much, but its probably going to be an ounce or more. A few hours later his boss called. After talking to him for a few minutes, he said he wanted to get enough that he could also sell to his workers throughout the week, and if everything worked out, he would call me again and get more. After discussing prices, he said he would get a quarter pound and he would stop by after work tomorrow with my step-dad.

I called Mark and let him know, and he said he was good to go. When my stepdad's boss came over, I forgot that I would have to take his money and go across the street to get it - and I forgot to tell him that. Luckily he trusted me and went to get it. I never realized how much weed a quarter pound was, and I didn't take a backpack or anything, and since it was only a 5-minute walk, I walked to Mark's house. After getting the weed, I tried stuffing it into my pants pockets (I had really baggy shorts), and the only thing I could do was stick it underneath my shirt. Mark laughed. The only point that I might get caught was when I was crossing the major street that was between mine and Mark's house. I was sweating bullets the whole walk over. I managed to not get caught and ended up getting weed for my step-dads boss until they left the state. This strengthened the relationship between me and Mark.

New Years eve came around and it was pretty dull. I don't remember why but for some reason I wasn't really getting shitfaced like I usually did on New Years, but I only drank a beer or two. I get a call from my step-brother's friend (I don't remember his name, so I'm going to call him ""Timmy!"". Timmy! was younger than me, but older than my brother - and he occasionally bought weed from me. He said he had a friend that could get Xanax bars for really cheap, and asked if I knew anybody that wanted any. I called Mark and he said he would buy the whole script, and I said I would go half and we would split it. Mark was already pretty drunk, so I was originally going to ask him to drive me to meet the guy, but when I got to his house, I knew that was out of the question. I got his money, and luckily when I got back to my house, my friend Shane stopped by and he had a car, and I told him I would give a few bars and gas if he drove me.

Shane and I picked up Timmy! on the way, and he was calling the guys and we met him in front of a bar. That night was pretty crazy. In the 15 minute drive, we saw 2 police chases and a SHITLOAD of cops. He pulled up next to our car, we gave Timmy! the money and he got out, got into the other car, and about 5 minutes later, got back in our car. When he got in our car he was crying, but we didn't realize it at first. He then told us that the guy put a gun to his head and took the money. They had already taken off. Fuck.

We got back to Mark's house and told him the story. We started grilling Timmy! and we found out that the guys seemed like they were on Xanax. Timmy! also told us that it was two guys, and the guy he knew was named Miguel. Mark then got the idea that he would call them. He used his phone and called them up.

*Mark:* ""Hey Miguel, it's Mark, I met you at that party the other day - you said to call you if I needed anything.""

*Miguel:* ""Oh yeah, what's up man?""

*Mark:* ""You know anyone that has any Xanax? I'm looking for a bunch for me and my friends.""

*Miguel:* ""Yeah, I have as many as you need.""

*Mark:* ""Ok, well I've been drinking, could you meet me close to my house?""

*Miguel:* ""Yeah, just tell me where.""

Mark then told him to meet him on a cul-de-sac that was a couple miles from his house that he was familiar with. At the end of the cul-de-sac was a dry ditch and another cul-de-sac. It was already pretty late, maybe around 1 or 2 in the morning, so there weren't very many cars out, we get to the cul-de-sac, and just like planned, they pulled up to the other cul-de-sac. Shane and Timmy! stayed in the car, and Mark and I got out and started walking towards their car, when they saw us, they got out. Mark asked if they had the Xanax and they said yeah. Mark told them that they got fake pills last time, and we wanted to make sure that they weren't fake, so the one guy pulled the bottle out of his pocket and handed them to Mark, then pulled the pistol out of his waistband and held it. The spot we were meeting them was pretty dark, and we started looking at the pills, and we said we couldn't see them, so we started moving towards the streetlight which was further away from them, and as soon as we got under the light, we started running, with the pill bottle in my hand.

The car was about 500 feet away, and a few seconds after running, they started shooting the pistol. I'm not sure if they aimed it at us, or if they shot in the air, but it still sucked nonetheless. We got in the car and sped off. There was almost no way they could catch us as we knew the area like the back of our hand, and we took the backroads back to Mark's house. We got to Mark's and split up the pills. Instead of 90 pills like there was supposed to be, there was only 60 - but that was better than no pills, and it was still an alright deal for the price we paid. Mark gave Timmy! a dime bag and I gave Shane a couple bars and we sat at Marks for a few hours until Mark passed out in his chair and we all went home. That was the first time I had been shot it (if they were shooting at me).

**I want to apologize for the story last night/earlier today. For those that don't know, I already released two stories that night and I already wrote a third, and I didn't want to release too many stories too fast, so I uploaded the third story to a pay-per-download site where if you wanted to read it before I released it the next day, you could download it for $1. I will not do this again. All the stories will be 100% free from now on, and it will be always be released on Reddit. I may make a website or subreddit to have a central location for my stories - but for now, they are exclusive to /r/opiates.**

**My arrest:**

Most of my stories are about me and my MM days. Before i was a MM dealing pills, i was a full fledged crack dealer. I also sold OC 80's, heroin, and blues - but mostly just crack. Growing up my parents smoked crack. My step-dad and my best friend's (James) - dad were friends when they were growing up, and my step-grandfather and James's grandfather used to hang out as well - mostly because his grandfather used to make PCP and sell it to all the biker gangs. So drug culture was something we just grew up around. For about a year, James was dealing crack - i didn't have any customers really, so there was no reason for me to try to sell it. My parents were homeless at the time, so i stayed with James.

That all changed when my parents got their income tax and moved into a shitty one bedroom apartment. My younger step-brother and step-sister were staying in the bedroom, while my step-dad and mom stayed in the living room. After a week or so, my step-sister ran away and started living with her boyfriend. I was working at Best Buy, and i had a few paychecks saved up, and James stopped by one day to sell some to my parents. I told him i had some customers and i wanted to buy some. So i bought $200 worth. My parents had ""friends"" that came over all the time, and they would smoke with them if they could do it there - so it was a perfect opportunity for me because i had it right there to sell to them. I sold that $200 worth the first night for $400.

I called James the next day and told him i needed a half ($400). He brought it over and again i sold it and pretty much doubled it. I was still working at Best Buy during the day, and selling at night. I got lucky because shortly after they moved me to deliveries, so i would come in, move the products to the truck, and sleep in the truck until we got to a customers house where we would install the TV, and i get in the truck and sleep again until the next delivery.

One night James and me were running around and we stopped at a gas station. He would regularly buy scratch off tickets, so he got a $20 ticket - i said ""Fuck it!"" and got one too. As we were heading back to the car, he realized he locked the keys in the car. We scratched the tickets and he didn't win anything. I almost felt bad to tell him that i won $5000. He paid the locksmith $150 to pop the lock and we went home.

Eventually i stopped buying from him and i found a guy that had better stuff and we both started buying from him. James was also dealing alot of heroin, blues and oxy's - so we would often refer customers to each other if the situation was right.

I ended up meeting a girl who did heroin, and i was mostly only doing blues back then, but i would bring her heroin when i came over to fuck, so i ended up doing it too. We ended up fucking for about 2 weeks, and then she found out James was the one that had all the heroin, so she stopped seeing me and turned her attention to James. James's gf stopped her though, but since his gf liked girls, she ended up sleeping with her (James never fucked her). About 2 days after that, she called James asking if he was home because she wanted to pick some up - he said he would be home in about a hour. She broke into his apartment and found $2000 worth of heroin, $2000 worth of blues and $3000 worth of cash and left. We got high as fuck, hid outside the woods of her house for about 12 hours one day, but we didn't see her - it was probably a good thing because it was a residential area and a AK-47 is loud as fuck. I googled her name about 6 months later - she had a warrant and ended up going to prison for 6 years.

I loaned James some money to get back started again, and my parents were getting kicked out their apartment, so i started staying with James. He was paranoid that someone else was going to break in again, so he felt safer with me there - someone was home almost all the time. I had decent customer base, and one of the customers was selling his car. It was a car he had just inherited off his mom or grandparent or something - so it was in great shape. It ended up costing me around $600. I switched a tag i had on one my other cars that wasn't running, and used it because it was the only car i had the time that was running, and planned on getting it registered in a few days.

At this time we were doing enough now for me and James to split a kilo, and cook the dope ourselves. We would each get 18 oz of coke, and make a oz or two at a time. If one of us ran out and the other still had a few oz, the other would front the other until we got another kilo.

I woke up and i knew i was out of dope from the night before. So i went into James's room and told him i needed a oz. I already had a few calls, so i told him i might need another by tonight, and he said he had 3 left, so we called the kilo guy to meet us - and said he could meet us tomorrow morning. I ended up getting rid of the 1st oz pretty fast, and around midnight me and James split the last oz. I ran around selling and it was around 3 in morning and i got the last call from one of my best customers. He wanted a $120 front - he was definitely good for it. I started heading his way which was about 5 miles away.

A quarter mile of the main road in the city was patrolled by some of the most overzealous cops in the county because the town only had a police force of 4 officers, and the only way to get money was to be overzealous and ticket and arrest as many people as possible, for any reason at all. The cop was in the median and there nobody else on the road. As soon as i seen him i already knew i was fucked. I didn't speed or really do anything wrong, but as soon as i passed him he got behind me and turned his lights on. I pulled next to a 7-11, and right there in the parking lot was FHP sitting in their car. They pulled in front of me. I knew he was reading the plates, and i knew they were going to come up the wrong plates - i just figured i would get a ticket and he would have someone pick me up. He got my license and registration (it was still registered to the guy i bought it off of), and sat in his car for a good 15 minutes. During this time i had several customers call me - including the one i was supposed to meet. My mom didn't have a phone at the time, so she would use the payphone at 7-11 to call me. About 5 minutes after i got pulled over, i see her use the phone. She was calling me. I told her i was car they had pulled over in the parking lot - she ran over like she was going to be able to do something. They told her if she didn't go home, she would go to jail. I was more embarrassed by this than anything.

They put me in handcuffs and put me in the back of the police car. Soon after a sheriff deputy pulled up, and the town cop that pulled me over, the sheriff and the FHP all discussed which one was going to do the booking, since i was out of the town's jurisdiction, and i was also close to the highway. The cop that originally pulled me over eventually convinced them, and the other two left. He went to search my car and while he was doing that, he would answer my cell phone and try to get my customers to meet him there - i had already told the ones that were calling me what happened, so none of them did. He found the 6 pieces of crack, and charged me with possession with intent to sell (which is ridiculous as 6 pieces is easily a personal amount). I went to jail and got a $5000 bond (took $500 to get me out). I had $900 in cash on me at the time, but they confiscated that so i couldn't use that for bond, along with my car and my cell phone. James bonded me out. I was in jail for about 48 hours.

I went back to the police station and i actually haggled with the police chief to buy my car and cell phone back. I still dealt for a little while after that until we moved to another city. I spent most of the money i saved up on lawyers. I got put on a year and half of felony drug probation. They dropped it from possession with intent, to just possession, and withheld adjudication. About 6 months after i was on probation, James mother died from a car accident - and i was pretty close to her. I told probation i needed to switch probation to another state for months, but she wouldn't listen. So i just moved. When it was time to check in, i called her and told her i moved. If it wasn't for James's uncle being a ex-cop, and currently working for the county's dispatch and me living with him, i probably would've violated and went to prison. I ended up living in the remote mountains where it took you 30 minutes to go to a gas station, and a hour to Walmart. And i knew nobody but James's family. I stayed clean for 2 years until i moved back to Florida.

I've already dosed some h today, I don't really intend to use the done today at all, but in curious if I were to use a very small dose (like 5mg?) would anything happen? I know it's not like suboxone where using a sub after another opiate you'll go into pwd's, but would that happen with methadone? I'm quite naive when it comes to methadone I'm sure you can tell, so basically my questions are:

1. I have 8 10 mg methadone pills, what's the best I can do with them to get high?
2. I've already dosed h, would using a very small dose of the methadone do anything?
3. If I don't use them at all today, how would you recommend I use them tomorrow? 
4. Can I use them at all in order to quit everything? 

I hope I'm not asking stupid questions, I tried searching for some answers but couldn't find much. I just want to know if I can either use them to get high, use a small dose now with the h to get *higher*, and if I can use them in any way to help myself quit opiates all together.

2) Whats the best ROA for this stuff, i was gunna just parachute or cap it cause i heard snorting burns like hell but if intranasal has a higher bio availability then i'll man up.

3) I have a crazy high xanax tolerance and took 6mg about 4 hours ago but i also used to take that high if not higher doses of xan when doing oxy or heroin. is combining benzos with tia any more dangerous?

thanks guys


UPDATE: started off taking 70mg orally and then 30mg orally like 10 min later there was definitely a noticeable buzz.

Then i plugged 150mg about 30 minutes after the 30mg oral dose and there was a slight rush followed by a decent opiate high but holy fuck it burned like i ate spicy indian food 

overall i think i'll just save this for when im in withdrawls  ",1454785538.0

I wish I could naturally give myself the euphoria that pain pills give me. I wish I didn't have to wake up everyday and ponder to myself ""well I'm out of medicine. What can I do to get money or meds?""

Sad thing is, I'm certain everyone here goes through this at least once or multiple times a day. I'm in mild W/D, have 20 bucks, and no ride to get my pills. It's no fun.

So now I've been hitting up old connects who have always had shit that got me and my girl right. We have tested all kinds of different dope before we buy it and nothing is doing the trick. We'll kind of not feel as bad and not be shitting our pants but back is still hurting, can't sleep as well and **definitely** haven't gotten high in days. No rush, no nod. 

Oh and our pupils won't pin. No matter how much we do. It's insane.

We don't shoot it and don't want to go to the needle. My buddy who shoots was trying to help me out and would tell me he found strong ass shit and then I'd snort well over the amount I would have to do to be well and to no avail, pupils not pinning, can't get high. So i guess from here we're just gonna be doing this dope that probably is good dope but just seems bunk to us because of our crazy tolerance. Guess it could be worse...

TL;DR: Was getting what I thought to be just some great dope but now have come to the conclusion that it was fent because dude got busted and we can't find anything else for the life of us that will get us high.

Edit: Forgot to add, I wouldn't wish this on anyone. We have wasted hundreds of dollars the last week and can't even get high. Fuck. Happy nods to everyone though.",1454785085.0

Before, I'd be getting intense euphoria when I did enough to start nodding but now the nodding's not really a pleasant experience since there isn't any euphoria.

My question is, do I just need to keep smoking and smoking once I hit the nodding to get to the euphoria, or am I near my max amount of heroin while I'm nodding so keeping smoking is a bad idea? If it's the latter then how the hell do I get that elusive euphoria back?

I'm a long-time lurker, first time poster. I just want to get some shit off my chest and hopefully see if anyone can somewhat empathize with where I'm at, because this really fucking sucks and there's no one I can talk to about this irl. 

When I was twelve, I found my older sister's body. She died from a heroin overdose and of course, this really fucked me up. It also consequently stemmed my curiosity of heroin, and I first tried it when I was eighteen (snorted it). In retrospect, I guess it was an effort to connect with her in some way. I didn't really like it. I puked and kept nodding. 

I went off to college and I didn't until I came home on breaks. I would meet up with the same crowd and I would get high maybe six times a year. 

When I graduated, I became an occasional user. I guess I'd consider it to be 'chipping.' But I landed my first job in social services and I stopped because I felt like a hypocrite for using in the field I'm in. Basically I worked with teenagers with developmental disabilities in a group home setting, and it was pretty brutal. I was attacked frequently and eventually, I was beaten up by the teens so badly that I couldn't return to work due to trauma. The night of the attack, I went and snorted some dope and I just... felt okay. I also had some neck and back issues from the attack, so the doctor prescribed me 90 10/325 Norcos, which was fucking wonderful.

I landed a new job that I fucking loved, guys. I worked on the inpatient unit of a hospital and I loved it so much that I gave up dope. I worked with adults with depression and anxiety and substance abuse issues and I was so fucking good at it - I received so much praise from my patients and my boss. I collected stacks of thank-you letters from my patients; I moved in with my boyfriend and for the first time in my life, I was fulfilled and happy. I was so fucking happy. 

I don't know what happened. I missed heroin and wanted to do it again, so six months into my job I reconnected with a friend who taught me how to shoot up. I had always promised myself I'd never shoot up, but I fucked up and it happened. I fell in love with heroin all over again. But I still was determined to try and go back to chipping; and it worked for awhile. I used maybe once a month, until the summer when it became a few times a week after work. I never let it get to the point where it affected my job, because I fucking loved it.

My boyfriend knew that I struggled with heroin, but he had no idea that I shot up. I claimed to him that I didn't know how, and I eventually became a very good liar. 

In November, I don't know what happened - I fell out or overdosed or something, but I jolted awake on my bathroom floor covered in my own puke, shivering and shaking. I had left the back door open since I was smoking cigarettes, and it was freezing outside. I convinced myself that I OD'ed and that the only reason I was alive was because I had left the back door open, but in retrospect I suppose I might have just fallen out. Regardless, I was pretty shaken up from it. I climbed into our bed and I was sobbing, shivering, and shaking. I was terrified that I could have died and kept having intrusive thoughts, seeing these vivid images of myself being dead on the bathroom floor next to my sister. It was fucking terrible, and I had to call off work for the next week.

I was clean for three weeks, and then I went right back to it.

Here's where I really fucked up. I got high after work and made a post on Reddit on a now-deleted account where I did an AMA about my job. I am a fucking IDIOT for doing this, and I keep asking myself why. My motivation at the time was to try and shed some light on mental illness and the dynamics of the job. I included the fact that I was opiate dependent, and I guess I was a bit specific about what type of unit I worked on. Of course, I'm NEVER going to disclose identifying patient information, and I made it a point not to. But I answered some questions about specific treatment plans - like how I would personally deal with a patient who was acting aggressively, how I would deescalate someone from a panic attack, etc. I also shared maybe one or two ambiguous stories about work. NEVER included anything specific, like names or ages or appearances, but I guess that and the fact that I disclosed my heroin usage was enough to get a lot of people pissed off.

Someone was able to find out where I worked and called HR. I got fired on Thursday. There was no mention of the heroin, but just the concern about disclosing personal information. 

/r/opiates, I'm a fucking mess right now. I loved that job more than anything else in the world, and now I'm left wondering how I'm going to pay my rent and what the fuck I'm going to do. I have no motivation anymore. It's like everything I loved was ripped away from me, and now I just want to get high. I know I fucked up and I know I deserve this. I'm stupid for making that post and I wish I never did it. I genuinely thought it would be helpful, but instead it angered a lot of people and makes me question if I'm a horrible person for trying to help people while using heroin in my own free time. 

My boyfriend thinks I've been clean since November. But since this happened, all I want to do is numb this fucking pain. It hurts so much to know that I fucked up everything I worked for because of dope. I can't talk to my boyfriend about it because he gets very, very touchy whenever I bring up the topic of heroin. He doesn't understand the drug and how my desire to use has been so fucking insatiable since I was fired; it's the only thing that comforts me right now, and I also know it's the only thing that's really holding me back. When I shot up tonight I had the motivation to go online and start looking for new jobs, when all I've been able to do is cry and sleep. 

This came out to be much longer than I anticipated, so I really do appreciate it if you've made it this far. Thank you so much for reading all of this, I know it wasn't well-written and I know it was a lot, but I just really needed to get this off my chest. I really can't talk to anyone about this shit. 

Can anyone relate to having lost something they fucking loved over a stupid mistake made while high? 

**TLDR:** Sister died from a heroin overdose. I started using to feel connected with her. Went from chipping to frequent use. Made a stupid fucking post while high and lost my job. Now I just want to use more. ",1454930899.0

**""A"":**

After moving away from my step-brother and step-dad. Nicole and I started living with my grandfather, Allen. Allen was retired and he loved watching movies, watching TV shows, and playing with his computers and other things to keep himself busy. He was on the opposite end of the spectrum as he never did drugs, never smoked, and would only drink a beer on special occasions.

After we moved in with him, everything started getting better. I got a decent job. We bought a car, and I was now close to my sister (she had both the same mom and dad as me). It had been about 4 months since I did any opiates, and I didn't know anybody that could get them. My sister had just had a baby and she came over to show off her baby. Nicole hurt her back when she was younger, and the day my sister came over, it was hurting her more than usual. My sister saw that and told Nicole she had a script of Lortab 7.5's she could give her that she didn't use them. Nicole got them.

That night we abused that script like it killed our first newborn.

Afterward, my sister gave us a number to her boyfriend's cousin, and he started selling us blues. He was our sole connect until we moved out and into our new apartment.

When we got into our new apartment, we quickly befriended our downstair's neighbor's. They liked to drink. And since I wasn't doing blues that much, we drank with them. One day he had a friend over. I had mentioned in passing that I liked Lortabs and such, and to let me know if he knew anybody that could get some. His friend Rudy was that guy.

He introduced us and we quickly hit it off. He invited me over to his house so he could call his connects. I told him I was really looking for blues, and he said no problem. About 20 minutes later we met his connect at the gas station across the street. It was the first time I ever met ""A"".

Over the next month or so, I had to go through Rudy to get blues until one day I saw ""A"" in the store. He came up to me and gave me his number, and told me to not go through Rudy again, and said Rudy was an idiot (he kinda was).

I went through ""A"" until I moved out of my apartment and moved back to my grandfathers. I still worked in the same city that ""A"" lived in, so I would usually meet him on payday after work.

I eventually quit that job, and Nicole's family was moving to California around the same time. She said she was lonely without her family here, and they offered her a plane ticket. She accepted and one day she was gone. Around this time ""A"" was also moving - only about a half a mile from my old apartment.

He called me up and asked if I would use my truck and help him move some stuff out of storage into his new apartment. I said of course and we spent most of the day moving his stuff in, talking most of the day. When we got done, it was around midnight. He gave me a couple blues for helping him and his girlfriend made dinner, and he said if I didn't want to drive home, I could stay the night, which I did.

At the time, I only had a few customers that I was MM'ing for, but then I found the Topix Oxycontin section online. I started posting there and my client base blew up. When I helped ""A"" move in, he was mostly a weed dealer,  and he didn't have but a few customers that did blues, so he only bought about a script a month. As my client base grew larger and I was buying more blues from him, he started buying more scripts.

I was meeting him so much that he told me to just start staying with him. He didn't have a license, so if his girlfriend asked why I was staying there, to tell her that I was driving him around - which I did every once in awhile.

At first I would get the customers money and run upstairs and then come back down with the pills. Now that I was staying with him, he would give me the pills first. This made things SO much easier. He would also front me 20, 30, or 40 pills at a time. Most of the time I would just need to do this when I had a customer coming, and he was going out or something.

I would get customers from out of state that was on vacation at Disney or Universal Studios, and would go through their pills or would forget to bring them, so taking a trip to the parks wasn't an unusual occurrence. This day the customer wanted 40, plus I had a regular that wanted 6. On the way, a cop car gets behind us. ""A"" started freaking out since he was the one holding the pills. I told him not to worry, that they didn't have their lights on our anything.

He starts unbuckling his pants, and he takes the bag of pills and shoves them into his asshole. He buckled his pants back up, and neither of us said a word. The cop never did pull us over.

We get to a gas station, and he went to the bathroom. We were the only two in the bathroom, and I was taking a piss as he was in the stall trying to remove the bag from his ass purse. Joking, I asked if he needed help. He said ""Yeah."" I told him I wasn't helping him, that he needed to figure it out on his own. He was in the stall for a good half hour trying to get the bag out, our customers calling the whole time.

I finally answered the phone for the guy that wanted the 40, explained the situation, and said to meet him at his hotel, he would take care of it. We get to the hotel and ""A"" is nervous - probably thinking this guy is some type of gay freak that wants to fuck him in the ass and steal the pills. Turns out the guy was just a medical professional.

They went into the bathroom and a few minutes later the pills were free of their dark, warm ass prison. ""A"" gave the guy a discount on the pills - and I still make fun of him to this day.

""A"" and I are still friends. And he is still my main connect ( I actually just met him before writing this). I actually have a few stories of ""A"", so if you like this one, I actually have more that are more exciting, but I wanted to introduce him in the most embarrassing way I could.

First things first. I am not a writer like everyone else here apparently is. I am not a professional storyteller, so please expect a grammatical catastrophe. Hell, I may even bore you to death with a wall of uninteresting text. I just see a lot of people telling stories and getting certain things off of their chests lately, so I figured I'd bust out a throwaway and give it a run.

I was in the Marine Corps, and then later the Army early in my life. I deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan with the later. I had a combat arms occupation and stayed fairly busy during my time in the sand. I took a severe blast via IED in Iraq, leaving me with chronic pain and an opiate addiction. This isn't really prevalent to the story in any way, just kind of an ""origins"" if you will. 

My friend Anthony and I had just found a new middle man. We'd never met him before, just got a number from a friend of a friend. I called the guy, and he claimed to be able to get ""the most fire of fires"". You know. How every middle or d-boy does. Based on the short phone call, this guy was the wiggerest of white boys. Had that obnoxious and high pitched Lil Wayne voice everyone just loves so much. We agreed to meet up the next day. The oddest thing about this guy so far was that he didn't have a fee. When asked, he said ""I'm good, man. My boy breaks me off."" You know what they say. If it sounds too good to be true.. 

Anthony and I are sitting in the parking lot of a shit stain Whattaburger in the middle of the slums. It’s 45 minutes after Middle Wayne said he'd meet us there, and he's not answering his phone. Fucking typical. He said he'd meet us there, and then we have to drive him out to his boy's house. We're contemplating leaving, then of course the phone begins to buzz. 
""Yo, dawg! I'm about five out, had to catch a different bus.""
I say fine. We'll be here. Like we've been here. He says he's bringing a friend with him, just because I have a friend with me. Obviously this raises red flags. But no matter the flag, or their color, nothing is going to stop me from getting my shit. Because heroin. I have a bit of a back and forth with my buddy. He's already saying we should call it off. I say it's fine, he's probably more worried about us than we are of him. Because middles are fucking spiders or some shit. I take my beautiful .45, a heavy black piece of unnecessary man stopper, out of my center console, chamber a round, pop the 11th into the magazine, and place it in my driver door compartment. 

Middle Wayne arrives about 20 minutes after he'd be there in 5 minutes. He and his friend look about the same. About 5'10""-6', 140ish. Nothing to be terrified of. Besides the both of them being the most obnoxious brand of wigger and talking non-fucking-stop, they seem like well meaning guys. After driving for around ten minutes, trying to sneak a word in occasionally to ask for directions through the city, Wayne hits me with the first curveball. 
""So, for taking ya'll to my boy, I'm gonna need two bags. That's straight with you, right?"" 
Now I'm not at all worried, I'm fucking irritated. I made it clear that wasn't the deal, reiterating that he had told me not to worry about it. He explained that he didn't charge my friend of a friend who hooked us up with him, but does everyone else. I'm clearly a fool for thinking I'd get something for nothing. The meager gram Anthony and I planned on getting was now a .8 for $160. We begrudgingly agree, as this is our only option right now, and of course, heroin. 

We get to the main man's house. Wayne and friend hop out, claiming they are going to go in, grab the dope, and head back out. Fuck. Fuck me. I'm letting my money walk. I never let my money walk, unless that's the only way I'm getting dope. So by ""never"", what I mean is that my money always fucking walks somehow. Fuck me. I expect to sit in my car until I'm well into my 40's waiting. To my surprise, Wayne runs back out within 5 minutes, though there is no friend to be found. He hops into the back seat, reaches over my shoulder, and drops a series of bags into my awaiting hand. 
""Aight, mayne, you should be good. This shit is fire! I'm gonna hang here wit my boy for a while, so ya'll niggas good to leave me here. Holla when you need some more!""
While he's talking, I'm obviously counting in my lap. Of course. 6 bags. As soon as he finishes his very brief and hastened goodbye, he has the car door open and steps out. I'm fucking livid. Absolutely fuming. But with the 1.5 seconds I had to think about the situation, I thought that maybe, just MAYBE, this was an honest mistake, and tried to stay as calm as possible. I stop him with a calm, but authoritative voice. I explain my 6 vs 8 bag concern. He confirms 6. Apparently, I ""misunderstood"". He needs 2 bags, and his friend needs two bags. This escalates into a louder argument very quickly. This shit could not be happening to me. In my mind at the time, I had been robbed. Not ripped off. Not cheated. This guy was straight up robbing me. I can't recall any time in my life that I had been this angry. 

At this point I'm out of the car. I'm standing on the front lawn, face to face with this low down thief. Anthony remains seated in the car. He's never really been a vocal guy. The kind of dude who avoids confrontation at all costs. Just sits there and observes with a few bags of dope now in his lap. I'm demanding dope or cash. Wayne is saying ""a deal's a deal"" and that I can pretty much go fuck myself at this point. From here, things went downhill very quickly. Wayne turns to walk up the sloping lawn back into the house, apparently done with what was only a heated discussion. I wasn't having that. I reached out and grabbed his arm, forcefully turning him back into my direction. I don't know if this was a knee jerk reaction or a calculated plan by Wayne, but as soon as he gets turned around, he shoves me. I was definitely expecting zero retaliation or physical aggression. The shove caught me totally off guard. I fell square onto my back, sliding down the hill a few feet. The next 10 seconds seemingly move in slow motion. Wayne hesitates for a moment, but decides to pursue me down the hill to continue what is now going to be a fistfight in all likelihood. I'm obviously feeling extremely vulnerable, my neck laying in the concrete gutter, my legs sprawling uphill towards my would be attacker. So I made a decision. I reached behind my back towards my belt, grabbing the pistol a had moved there minutes earlier while my new found middle grabbed my new found dope, and swung it upwards towards the quickly advancing man. Today me looks back at then me and wonders why I didn't point the pistol and yell for him to stop. Why I didn't take control of the situation and issue commands as I had done a hundred times before.

As soon as the pistol leveled after I swung it forward, I pulled the trigger. And again. And once more. The thunderous booms rang through the neighborhood louder than anything I had ever heard in my life. I’ve fired plenty of pistols, a few men’s share of rifles. I’ve tossed grenades and flashbangs, been on the receiving and firing end of artillery, as well as driven through three separate IEDs. Nothing rang nearly as loud as this .45 did at noon Thursday in the suburbs. I don’t know how many of the three rounds made contact. I can only confirm the one. The assumed showstopper. Wayne slid on the grass, head hitting my outstretched feet. I looked back and Anthony was now out of the car, standing about three feet behind me, a look of expected horror on his face. He probably got out to help me out after he watched it turn physical. I wished I’d had that information about 20 seconds prior.

Oddly, my first thoughts were not “My God, what have I done?” My first thoughts were damage control. I clumsily came to my feet, and looked at Anthony. I just screamed “Get in the fucking car!” He clasped both hands behind his head, letting out a very timid “What the fuck, man?”, and got back into the passenger seat. I walked the couple steps up to the facedown Wayne. He’s been screaming the entire time. The screams didn’t faze me like they’re supposed to. I’ve heard these screams before. I reached down, glancing at the hole in his back. The hole is about the size of my outstretched hand, sans fingers. I pick up Wayne’s phone, place it in my pocket, and take the few steps back towards the street. I recover my shell casings and place them in the same pocket. I didn’t render first aid, or call 911 like a person does. I immediately went for the closest evidence. I get into the driver’s seat of my still running car and gun it. I have to be going to prison soon. I just shot a man over what was essentially $40. 

There’s no happy ending here. I can’t really share the rest of the process and leave out or change the needed details that I would need to. This is just an example of some of the awful things drugs can force you to do. Not that I was “forced”. My decisions are of course my own. And my actions I have to live with. I just felt like sharing with the community. Not exactly a “feel good” story. If you made it through without dying of boredom, thank you for reading.

A few years ago, I went out with some friends to a bar. I had been eating percocet, drinking beers and stuff started to get fuzzy. After finding half of a random seroquel in my shirt pocket and taking it (because, you know, that was the sensible thing to do), it was nightie-night for me. 

My friends were sitting at a table talking with a few girls who claimed to be strippers and two others they suspected of being prostitutes. Anyway, I was starting to doze off when one of my friends gently tapped me on the face and said: ""Hey, dude- maybe you should grab a glass of water and smoke a cigarette or something."" So, I stumbled my way down to the bar, drank a glass of water, went outside, plopped down on a ledge, started smoking and fell asleep. This was the last thing I remember and in retrospect, I'm really lucky that nobody tried to rob me or anything.

When I didn't return within 20 minutes, one of my friends (who was also my roommate) found me outside, passed out, and with the help of another friend, carried me across the street and put me in his car so I could continue sleeping.

After, while I was still in the land of nod, the girls invited my friends to their house. They went, stuff got sloppy, and before they left, they stole a bunch of innocuous stuff for shits and giggles.

Upon arriving home, my friends carried me inside and set me down on the couch.

I woke up the next morning to see an acoustic guitar smashed to pieces, a designer cutlery set strewn about the living room, one of the girls who we thought was a prostitute sleeping on the couch across the room, and a voicemail from the restaurant I worked at telling me I was fired for a no-call-no-show. 

I had never been so confused in my life.

TL;DR- fell asleep outside of a bar, woke up on my couch to a smashed guitar, a bunch of knives laying everywhere, a hooker(?) sleeping on my couch, and a voicemail telling me I was fired from my job",1454916859.0

So my amazing Doctor asked if I would mind switching to fentanyl instead.  Of course I said yes. 

Now for my question:  I've been around the block as far as opiates go, but the one I've never messed with is fentanyl.  I want the best bang for my buck but IV isn't an option.  So should I gum it, smoke it, or just slap it on the proper way?

He's pretty straight, and I usually use him for H when my main dude isn't available. It's a little pricey for the quantity but the quality is nice. Anyways, I've worked with him a few times and have never had any issues. So I decide to text him tonight just to see if he could find any bars since he fucks around with a bunch of different drugs. He said yes and could do 5/$30, not the best deal but the only one I could find unless I wanted to pay $6/20-30 minimum...yeah no thank you! Lol anyways, he's sends an address - which is fairly close, which is awesome, and I head that way. We have a little trouble finding each other cause the neighborhood is weird and circular. But ya, I find him and figure he has the goods bc the way he has his hands/arms hanging on my window door. So I (stupidly) give him my cash thinking he's gonna drop a little Baggie in my hands. Nope, goes back to the car he was in and calls me? To tell me to pull in front of him, park, turn my lights off and he'll be right back in 2 minutes. *sigh*....so I do and 2 minutes turns to 5, then 10, then 15, then 20... I circle the neighborhood and repark in the same place. Then figure, fuck it, he fucked me. This dude that I've dealt with 10x decided to fuck me for $40. 



I text my BFF who is the person who originally gave me his # to see if she can figure out where he's at or just figure out what's going on or really anything. He texts her back but won't answer my calls or texts. He tells her he's heading to ""city"" and is serving me atm and can meet her in said city. So, if he's fucking me over - why would he say that at all? Idk, I just can't believe I fucking handed someone money without seeing anything first. It's such an amateur move and I've been doing this for years. I feel like such a moron: I just finished crying on my SO's shoulder bc I kept him up past midnight (he usually is in bed by 11:15-11:25ish since he gets up at 6:20 for work) and every penny is tight, and I just gave some asshole money that I work really hard for. And the thing is, if he didn't rip me off...I would continue to go through him and but shit off him. So he could have theoretically made muchhhh more than just 40$ off me, y'know?

While I was living with my friend James's dad up north, I talked to a girl I met online for about six months to a year. Her name was Nicole, and she lived in Florida. Her uncle lived in Alabama and just got a divorce and needed help with his kids, so he helped her move up there with him.

I came down to Florida one time and stayed with her for about a week, but other than that, Nicole and I had never met. Around the time Nicole was staying with her Uncle, James and his girlfriend Tricia moved up to stay with James's dad and me. And around the same time that James and I started fighting, Nicole's Uncle started getting back together with his ex-wife, so Nicole felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave. On the way back to Florida, we picked up Nicole and, at first, we lived with one of Nicole's friends.

This only lasted about a week, as her friend seemed sane at first - once you live with her, her true feeling comes out.

My step-brother lived with a foster family for about a year before he turned 18, so when he turned 18, they got him an apartment. Instead of living in his apartment he lived with his girlfriend, and used the apartment for the small amount of stuff he had. He said me and Nicole could stay there for awhile, so we moved in. I never realized how disgusting my step-brother was. Maggots in the fridge. Dirty clothes and dishes everywhere. Nicole and I cleaned it top to bottom. Soon after my step-brother decided him and his girlfriend wanted to move back in.

This wasn't really a problem, except for the fact that he had a weed addiction. I never believed that someone could be addicted to weed until I moved into his apartment. When he was high he would laugh and joke, but when he was sober, he would get mad and smash stuff and throw stuff around. This was in the middle of the ghetto, so I ended up doing ghetto tattoo's (I had all real equipment - just not the proper setting) and ended up giving him money every day so he could get high.


My step-brother's dad is my step-dad, with us sharing the same mom. They had been together for almost 20 years, but at the time, they were kinda separated. My step-dad found an older ""sugar momma"" named Madeline that was about 20 years older than him, that wasn't rich, but she was prescribed Oxy's, Xanax and a ton of other drugs - plus she pulled a decent pension from her dead husband. Somehow my mother convinced him to let her sleep on the couch since she had nowhere else to go.

Nicole and I were at Madeline's house one day for a BBQ, and when we got home, Nicole saw that one of her bags was unzipped. She looked inside and found a few things missing. We asked my step-brother and his girlfriend, and they denied it. A few days later more stuff came up missing. My step-brother stayed the night at his girlfriends house one night, and we decided to go in their room and look for the stuff. We found a few things, but a couple of other things was still missing - mostly the expensive stuff.

We told Madeline about it, and she said she had a small bedroom we could stay in if we wanted, and we accepted the offer. My step-brother came over the next day and was pissed off that we left. We told him we found the missing stuff, and we wanted the rest back. He girlfriend said she's not giving it back - and that was also missed a bag of clothes when moving. So we called the cops so we can get inside to get at least the bag of clothes. The cops showed up, and his girlfriend denied it all for about 15 minutes, then finally said admitted and threw our stuff from the second story apartment as the cops watched. We grabbed our stuff and left - no charges filed.

We soon realized that Madeline wasn't just prescribed the medication so she could sell them like most people did at that time, but she really needed some of them. She would fall asleep at the wheel because she had narcolepsy, so she would take Dexedrine to stay awake, but then she couldn't fall asleep after she took those, so they also prescribed her Xanax. She had 100's of these creepy 2-foot tall dolls everywhere in her house, and after she would take Xanax, she would hide pills in money in their dressed and in the hollow backs. Then a week later if she needed money, she would start searching the dolls. If she couldn't find any, she would have Nicole help her look.

A few times Nicole would find pills, and Madeline would say that it wasn't hers. So Nicole would just keep them. Nicole and I started doing blues soon after finding a few.

My step-brother and his girlfriend came over one day to buy some blues, and when his girlfriend saw Nicole. She started calling her names. I told Nicole to just stay in the room and lock the door. His girlfriend then started to knock on our door and told her to leave her alone. My step-brother then started getting in my face, so I went into the room with Nicole.

As I was walking into the room, he and his girlfriend pushed his way into the room. His girlfriend went straight to getting into Nicoles face. I pushed her away and told my brother to get his girl and leave. He said no and started walking toward me while running his mouth, as I held back his girlfriend. As soon as he got close enough, I punch him in the face and he dropped like a rock. His girlfriend started freaking out as I grabbed him by the arms and dragged him outside as he clutched his face from the blood running from his nose.

The cussed and got in their car and drove off. About 10 minutes later we hear glass shatter, and see their car pull off. He threw a rock threw Madeline's car window. He showed up a few days later and talked to Madeline while I was at work. When I got home from work Madeline said it was our fault, and she wanted us out within a week. We moved out the next day to another city and lived with my one of my family members that helped us out tremendously.

Madeline and my step-dad are still together. My step-brother and his girlfriend moved in shortly after we moved out. My step-brother ended up getting hooked on Oxy's pretty bad, and now he's in prison. Madeline got in a bad car accident falling asleep at the wheel. I heard that they prescribed her even more drugs. They started some pretty bad accusations towards me - I haven't talked to them in 4 years.

Anyway, due to availability and such, the only pills that you can really get in my area is Subutex. Suboxone is also available, but to a lesser extent, and not as popular, for obvious reasons. Anyway, what I don't get is that, apparently, I get a buzz from it and that seems to be very rare. I hear people talking about how they don't get one from it. But, also, when I take it, it does two weird things: for one, I don't get my buzz from it unless I take it pretty soon after I wake up. Secondly, I basically can only take one dose a day. Like, if I don't zzz before I take another dose (and I HAVE to have a dream or else it doesn't work), I won't get my buzz from that second dose.

What do you think of all that? Is that normal? General thoughts?

Secondly, the buzzes. I have my own terms for them since you I don't know your terms xD: 

The holy grail is what I call the ""forehead buzz"". It's when my forehead feels nice and cloudy. It's beautiful, makes me happy, and it's just awesome.

The one I hate is the ""eyeball buzz"" (I think this is what you call ""nodding"") and I fucking HATE it with a burning passion. It's like the buzz gets in my eyes, makes my eyelids heavy, and makes me feel like I'm gonna zzz, but I don't zzz. I hate it because I hate feeling like I'm gonna zzz because, the way I look at it, if you buy a pill and spend your own money on it, you should want to stay awake so you can enjoy it. Know what I mean?

Anyway, I'd appreciate general thoughts on that, too. Also, maybe, how can I stop the nodding, if that's possible? I have just been splashing cold water on my face, but it's a very temporary fix, if at all. 

Anyway, if you have any thoughts, comments, answers, I'd appreciate it. Thank you, have a good day, and have a good buzz. :)",1454896397.0

Not fucking up the phone call is the most important thing since often I freeze and don't know what to say; I don't wanna seem like a cop.

Should I plan out a place to meet? What place should I meet him at? A parking lot by a major corporation? What's expected? I don't want to go into a stranger's car? How much should a gram of street dope cost? (I know on the markets it's at least $100 for tar, but street is different - there's not much dope in my city).

**Edit:** My idea would be to ask to smell the dope before I pay? If he only lets me see but not smell/taste and I feel it's a scam then what do I do? BTW I'm female. Does all dope smell at least like a bit of vinegar? So far for me all mine has, so I don't wanna run away if his doesn't and is still legit, especially if he drives to me.",1454888820.0

**Tricia:**

*I originally was going to post ""Madeline"", but as I wrote this story, ""Madeline"" turned more into ""Tricia"", so expect ""Madeline"" next.*

I moved out of Florida and I completed probation. I was living with my friend James's dad and lived on a 100-acre property that James's aunt owned which we maintained for living there. She had just built a new house about 500 feet from her old house, and we lived in the old house, which was still in great condition. It had a lake and ATV's and ATV trails, which were about the most fun thing you could do in the mountains.

I had been clean for almost 2 years, and James and his girlfriend Tricia moved in with me and his dad. They had been together for 7 years, but the Oxy's got the best of him and he was broke and robbing people that he used to get scripts from. He moved up with almost a full script of blues - minus the 20 they did on the way up. Tricia also got arrested in a sting trying to buy a script and got charged for conspiracy to distribute. She was out on bail and waiting for her court dates.

They got in around midnight. The next day I didn't work, so when he asked if I wanted to do a blue, I said sure. I snorted half, and a few hours later, I saw him in his room shooting his, so I had his girlfriend shoot mine up too. I worked the next couple days, and by the time the weekend came around, they had less than 10 pills left. So I didn't ask for any.

A day or two after that, all their pills were gone, and they soon went into detox. On the fourth or fifth day, they started drinking the beer we would bring home after work, which wouldn't normally bug us, except they would get drunk and argue.

After fully detoxing, they really got into drinking. Instead of getting Budweiser or Coors Light like we would, they would get high ABV beer like Steel Reserve or Natural Ice (we lived in a semi-dry county, so no liquor). And they would drink for effect. Almost getting shitfaced every night.

Soon after his girlfriend slowly started coming on to me. She would wait for me to get a nice buzz and put her hand on my leg. Looking back on it, I didn't realize she was doing this, as we had been close friends for 7 years, and I didn't think she was into me. Then one night James got really drunk and tried to drive his car. Tricia and I were playing poker and a police cruiser pulled up and James stumbled out. The officer told his dad that he crashed the car, walked into someone's house and laid down. The officer told us to put him in bed, and for us to get the car in the morning (sometimes small town cops are the best). James fell asleep on the couch, and his dad went back to his room and went to sleep.

Tricia and I went back to playing poker and drinking. I don't really remember how it got started, but she flashed me after losing a hand, and I ended up flashing her. We soon ran out of beer and we both went to our separate rooms.

A few days past. Tricia didn't know how to ride the ATV's, so she would always jump on the back with me or James. We had been drinking most of the day, and she got on the back with me and we went deep into the woods. It was in the twilight hours, and we went back to an area that had a huge cliff, and we parked the ATV and opened a beer and just admired the view. After the beer was gone, Tricia took her shirt off and unbuckled my shorts and started giving me head like we did it every day. Looking back, I should've stopped her, but she was beautiful, and I always had a secret crush on her. That and the buzz I had, and not having any sex for almost 2 years (one of the worst things about living in the sticks), it was a bad combination.

We finished and after she really opened up and telling me everything. How she started stripping so they could get blues in Florida. How she met guys at the clubs and she would sleep with them so they could get even more money. And how when she wanted to stop stripping (James didn't know about the other stuff), James wouldn't let her. And how they were living in the car because they would spend all the money on blues. It just went on and on.

For about a week after that, I tried to avoid being around her by myself. Then it snowed one day and everything was covered in a white blanket. I took her for a ride on the ATV. We got to a lower part of the mountainside, and we parked the ATV again. We just drank beer and talked for about an hour. Afterward, she told me she and James haven't had sex in about 2 months. She started undoing my pants again, but this time, I stopped her. I told her we shouldn't, but somehow she convinced me it wasn't wrong.

That night James passed out early, and Tricia and I went to the store and got some more Steel Reserve. After a few beers and playing poker, I told her I was going to bed. We both went into our rooms, and I started watching a movie. About 20 minutes later she asked what I was watching and if she could watch it with me. I said sure. First she sat on the ground. Then sat on the bed. Eventually, she was laying in bed with me. She got her hand down my pants under the covers, and soon after, we were fucking.

The next few days I felt really guilty. She would still try to flirt with me, but I would refuse. A few weeks later we got drunk again, and she gave me head again. But that was the last time. She soon went back to Florida for sentencing and went to prison for 2 years.

About a month or two after going to prison, she wrote a letter to James, telling him everything. He confronted me about it, and I admitted to everything. At first, he didn't say anything. Then he got pissed and we got into a fistfight. I ended up packing all my stuff, and stayed with his aunt for a few days, and she ended up sending me to Florida.

James and I didn't talk for almost 3 years. It wasn't until he got clean and had kids with a new girl that he started talking to me again. He ended up going to prison and he said besides family, I was the only one that wrote him.

Tricia ended up doing her time. Got out, and started her life over. She met someone, got married and moved to NYC. She said she hasn't touched any drugs besides weed since prison.

This past winter I got really depressed. Borderline suicidal free-will-can't-exist I'm going mad and the world makes no sense while my head is splitting into pieces depressed. I've been on and off this way since I was a teen, 24 now. Certain SSRIs help me but they have some unfortunate side-effects. I'm currently on citalopram which is keeping the really really low moods at bay.

Been using PPT, and rarely insufflated heroin to help with my mood for the past 4 - 5 months. It's effective, even if the crash is sometimes hard. Been a bit worried more recently about whether I'm using because I'm addicted, or just because it's an effective if non-permanent solution to how I feel. I've been using on and off for about 3 and a half years and have never gone through withdrawals.

I'm seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow and I'm not sure whether or not to be honest about my drug usage. My main fear is that they'll pawn me off to local substance abuse services, which I don't currently feel I qualify for. I don't use bags of heroin a day, or even have any dependence... yet. That or they'll try to play off my depression as a substance abuse issue, rather than the drug abuse being a symptom of my underlying depression and social anxieties? 

I'm not really sure what to do, was wondering if anyone else had found themselves in this situation and what kind of response they've gotten from psychs? I live in the UK if that makes any difference.

And sometimes Im the luckiest man in the world.,"Last night I went to go cop. Its a 2 1/2 hour drive and I usually take friends money to get them some too because the prices in our town are absurd.

So last night I picked up just over 5 grams. After meeting up with dude I made a shot in my car and put everything back in my gear bag except the dope. I forgot about it sitting on my lap. I then drove to Walmart as fast as I could because we needed new rigs and the pharmacy was gonna close any minute. So when we pull up to the front and my wife says to go in and she would hop in the drivers seat and go park the car while Im buying rigs. Since I didnt realize the dope was on my lap and we were hurrying it fell off my lap onto the snow covered parking lot right infront of the Walmart main doors.

Get my rigs, hop back in the car and start driving downtown to meet up with a friend that lives there. Get about 20 mins away when I get to thinking, I dont remember putting the dope back in the bag. So we pull over and look. Its not there. Its not anywhere in the car either. Now all my dope and a large amount of my friends dope is gone. I dont have the money to make it right by them cuz I spent everything I had with just enough for gas to get home. 

So we speed back to Walmart and start looking at the part of the parking lot where I got out. Junkie Jesus was smiling upon us because we found it. It was crushed all to hell (its bth) but we didnt give two shits. 

The dumb thing is, is we've done this almost exact thing before. Only last time we made it all the way back to our home town and came back the next morning to luckily find it where we parked our car at an arbys parking lot.

Anyone have any rediculously lucky saves like that?",1454882341.0

I haven't posted here in such a long time due to the fact that I'm 13 months clean from opiates.. 


i just want to make amends to people I've done wrong but i don't think I'm ready for that ...

in 2010 i purposly jumped off a 60ft cliff into water and broke my sacral joints, hip and snapped my tailbone thru my rectum.. yea it hurt like a mother fucker and yes i almost died but luckily my cousins were there and saved my life. but i wanted to just end my emotional suffering being molested and raped as a child by one of my neighbors as well as being abused by my father in his drunken tirades... so i said fuck it and jumped, i wanted to land on my head but since gravity exists my fat ass rotated and i landed right smack on my ass! my cousins tied a tourniquet around my  stomach and top of my legs so i couldn't loose my cock due to hemorrhaging or what ever.. 

 i had immediate surgery due to the injuries and i was previously taking blues and sniffing dope daily prior. anyways i had a family member who knew a crooked dr. and i manipulated the shit of this pain doctor, he was an anesthesiologist specializing in spine pain. since i was flat broke spending my money on dope, i instantly stopped doing it due to the fact i was on 4x ir10mg oxyMorphone /day , 1x 30mg oxymorphone a day , with 50 mcg fentpatch worn every 3-5days. all together with insurance the prescribtions turned out to be 15$ per month. i was in heaven i thought until i was cut off due to the fact that the dr was being watched and then finally poof he gets arrested and lisence taken away because he just wrote scripts like nothing... anyways i was cut off and the his practice closed down... and i went into immediate withdrawals and decided to go back into detox... well that didn't work


so i started selling ""things"" to obtain my habit... and i had a crazy fun 3 years but it was getting old shooting up and living like a savage and fucking whores and stealing their money, robbing thugs, stealing scrap...
 i was kidnapped by my higher up, and i was blindfolded duct taped and forced into his car with one of my runners. it late october 2014 and i honestly didn't give a shit because i wanted it all to end.. so were driving.... and driving .... and FUCKING driving... dead silent and I'm like ""bigs what are you gunna do , shoot me and leave me in some field, chop my body in half fucken what the fuck are you waiting for just fucking do it ... and the my runner is fuckin crying like a little bitch begging not to kill him.. bigs pistol whips me and tells me to shut up.. ( and yes being pistol whipped is like getting hit with brass knuckles...) I SCREAM DO IT PUSSY FUCKING end me now!

bigs and his boy he was with (mind you there hard time felons dark skin black built like a fullback) ... he stops the car and un-blind folds us and said were here..

and I NEED YOU and ur boys help , we gotta bag my higher up (bigs higher up) i scream the fuck at him why you blind fold me and whipped me with ur pistol n shit you could have fuckin told me ass hole ! and we all start laughing.. so he came up with this plan we had to do to rob his higher up cuz he did BIGS dirty.. so we wait till he leaves his place, then boom we get in there and bigs is screaming at these poor hispanic hookers screaming wheres the shit wheres the mother fucking stash! hoodies on and bandanas over our faces were pointing bigs guns , we grab the two hookers take their phones search them and they showed us the stash.. there were 5 shoe boxes full of cash, dope , cocaine, guns , and other shit i aint never seen..  so we got it nobody was hurt, and everything ended smoothly ... 



being clean I'm so ashamed of it tho even though it was exhilarating .. but business is business and after that happened i was a mess.. and i broke down... and decided i had enough... that was my last memory and last time i used,


TL/TR: i purposly jumped off a cliff into water broke my hip, sacral joints, and snapped tailbone thru recum. gross i know, manipulated my dr. , then i robbed my higher up got kidnapped , and he forced us to help him rob HIS higher up! 

i feel shitty and ashamed but thats life, what are your deep confessions?

Australian here (in Vic) with a question.
WTF is going on with this pharmacy codeine database at the moment? 
I've never had an issue buying panadeine packs and having my drivers ID recorded. Never had any sales denied. 

Last month I went to a late night pharmacy and got a pack (they asked for ID), and then 5 days later I got stuck with none and a serious headache at 10pm and had to go back to this same pharmacy. They asked for ID again and went to the computer and started acting really suss, questioning me why I had run out (told them I left them at my mate's house).
2 weeks later I went to a different pharmacy and they carded me and told me I was using it too much and needed to get a script from my doctor or they couldn't sell it to me. I had very rarely bought off this pharmacy so I don't see why they would have reason to deny me. Have I been red flagged? 

I thought pharmacy's weren't allowed to share data unless it is a part of project STOP for pseudo?

Before judging, yes I am aware that I am taking too many OTC painkillers, I'm doing a taper down plan. Have had a mild H addiction and thought OTC painkillers was a nicer way to taper than Suboxone.

**""A"", part 2:**

Now me and ""A"" were living together, with his girlfriend and her two kids. Everyone got along pretty well, including his girlfriends kids, and ""A""'s daughter that he had from another relationship. Victoria, ""A""'s daughter, always had the movie ""Rio"" playing in the background, all day, every day - ""A"" eventually started hiding the movie because the theme song would drive us insane. Eventually, she stopped looking for it.

Right about this time, I was selling to a guy named George. George and his father had grow houses all over the state, and would trade and sell his weed to ""A"" and I. Often it was the best weed in the area.  Now me and ""A"" had a great setup where he was mostly the money, and I was the salesman, and business was great. Nina - ""A""'s girlfriend - would joke that she was living in a trap house because of all the drugs and people that we had come in and out. ""A"" had no problem bragging about this to his friends.

George's weed started off as your typical mid-grade weed, but it seemed every week it would get better and better. I didn't smoke, but all my customers would make sure to tell me the quality. Vaporizers, I heard, would leave people couch-locked with the smallest amount. Everyone that smoked weed wanted George's (""A""'s) weed in the end.

You would think that being on probation would scare ""A"" and keep him from selling or even being around drugs. Other than smoking weed, ""A"" would do just about everything you're not supposed to do on probation, but he ended up completing it with no problem. Untouched - ""A"" had a big party a few days after his probation was over.

Up at the front office of his apartment complex, they were beefing up security because of the George Zimmerman trial, and they expected riots if he was found innocent. People were getting especially nervous were we lived, because Trayvon Martin was killed only a few miles from where we lived.

Zimmerman was found not guilty, and a few people tried to set some cars on fire, including mine (but it didn't work) - so the apartment complex security got my information, and when they realized that I wasn't on the lease - they gave me a week to move out or ""A"" and his family had to move. Of course, I moved out.

I get anxiety (I know, whats the point of getting high when you get anxiety sometimes from dope). Keep in mind that I do not IV the heroin, but sometimes I get worried when I think I snorted too much. I know if you are in real need of medical help, you won't be responsive, but what about if you are nodding out like crazy? Should you call for an ambulance? If you think you over did it, what should you do? Is it a myth that cold water helps and standing up and not sleeping helps? What are some tips to staying alive? Be respectful, I know this can be labeled as a ""stupid question."" :(

*This mindset is why I don't IV anymore. I use to IV black tar heroin and I always got anxiety. I would always get worried if I packed that syringe too much

*If you can also tell me: Am I significantly safer if I am snorting powde heroin (heroin #4) than IVing? I do not hear a lot about snorting heroin overdoses.",1454993639.0

I posted a simple story and a tidbit regarding another incident where I knowingly injected heroin in full site of an officer of the law. I apologize for the delay in finally typing this up and I'll also preface this by apologizing for all the typos ahead of time as I'm typing this on my new tablet which is not the most efficient way to go about writing anything. Now with all that out of the way and a glass of wine in hand and sweet lady heroin in my veins (cheat day as I'm pretty clean these days minus my suboxone everyday) which is giving me some creative juju to get this done.

This story takes place  maybe 7 years ago at possibly my lowest point in regards to my addiction. I'd now been homeless on the streets of NYC since 2005 and was so deeply and firmly embedded into the ""street kid"" scene that I was perfectly okay with panhandling by day and middling for anyone who had the cash and desire for dope, coke, and well...anything. Any situation where I would profit in some way, whether it was drugs or money, I would take full advantage of.  No matter how shady the deal or how blatantly risky it was I was usually not only down for it but eager to hustle it.  I was spending most of my time in the lower east side (L.E.S.) of Manhattan and usually around the infamous Alphabet City.  

Tompkins Square Park.  If there is a junkie holy site or a syringe littered Mecca for dope fiends that has great historical importance for our brand of masochistic religion...its Tompkins.  Located in the L.E.S. and occupying the areas of 7th street to 10th street and stretching from Avenue A to Avenue B (Alphabet city is Avenue A thru D. D is located on the FDR highway bordering the east river).  I could type up an entire post just simply on the historical merits of this once seedy and drug ridden neighbourhood that was one of the first and most prolific open air markets in the history of drugs. Some names that you might recognize who called this neighbourhood home are almost erection inducing.  Allen Ginsberg, G.G. Allin, The Ramones, Lou Reed, Jim Carroll and the original heroin kingpin Lucky Luciano.

Okay enough of the history lesson because I'm assuming you came to read about how Gratefulstickers shot dope in front of a member of the NYPD. Every year on or around August 5-6th there is a concert in Tompkins in memory of the famous riots that occurred in the neighborhood on those dates in 1988. You can read about the riot [here.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tompkins_Square_Park_Riot_(1988) As I recall it was an exceedingly hot summer and luckily there was one small reprieve from the oppressive heat that summer and that was some ridiculously strong heroin that only us street kids had access to and it was being sold right in the park. The dealers were two Puerto Rican cats named J.R. and Flocco (of course his name was Flocco) but they would only sell to a select few of us.  Fortunately the protagonist of this story (me) was one of the chosen few who they would sell their wares to.  Problem was everyone wanted this dope and this demand ranged from other street kids to businessman and NYU students alike. Actually this wasn't a problem at all for myself but a golden opportunity to get my hustle on. You wanted a ten dollar bag? That means your buying me one, a bundle? 2-3 for me and so on and so forth. I literally didn't need to panhandle any money up for a month or so because of the intense demand but relatively small circle of junkies who could actually purchase this dope.  A minor side note, this dope actually didn't come in bags. It was very rocky for the first few weeks and they were too lazy to purchase a box of glassine bags and instead wrapped the tiny rocks in tinfoil. As an east coast and more specifically tristate junkie who's always been use to glassine ""stamp"" bags this struck me as odd.

The concert consisted of many local L.E.S. punk bands ranging from Leftover Crack to the Cro Mags. The park was filled to the brim with the usual junkies, gutter punks, and punk kids from all over the city. Now obviously an event commemorating a full fledged riot against the NYPD and almost entirely consisting of drunk punk kids is going to have quite the police presence.  This year was no exception and they had vans, cruisers, and bike cops scouring all over the park to keep the ""peace."". I had just gotten done with middling a few bags for a gutter punk I swore was Spanish but it might if just been a very impressive dirt tan. We had walked a few blocks outside of the park for obvious reasons and due to the extreme heat I'm sure anyone walking by me with a nose would of been offended by one of several odors that were graciously wafting from my body. Now to a keen and educated nose you would of picked up the scent of vinegar and vitamins or as I call it "" dat dope sweat."" My body was fueled by only a select few items due to the sake of efficiency.  They were heroin, [Sparks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_(drink) and zebra cakes.  The heat was causing excessive sweating which will really speed up your metabolism and in my opinion cause you to burn through your internal stores of opiates causing sickness to creep up much quicker then say, the middle of November.  Feeling those first pangs of hunger (for heroin) and the realization I have a few bags of heroin stashed on my person resulted in a simple solution, actually the only solution I had for anything..that was to shoot more heroin. The only problem was finding a place to bang up  being as our usual spot which we lovingly named ""Crusty Row"" in the front of the park was literally a sea of b!us uniforms.  Being banned from pretty much every bar and restaurant in the vicinity of the park left me with very few options. Actually only one option, the Tompkins Square park bathroom.

You know that scene in Trainspotting with the worst toilet in Scotland? That was a goddamn porcelain palace next to the men's room in Tompkins.  If the concrete walls could speak in that bathroom they wouldn't, wanna know why? They'd have a crack stem in-between their lips.  This bathroom had survived the raging drug abuse of this once impoverished neighbourhood through the heroin epidemic after and during the Vietnam war to the 80's days of ""jumbo"" crack vial slinging glory.  I've personally seen several bodies carried out with deceased OD victims and had to perform CPR on fallen out comrades on the lovely grime covered floor. When you walk in the first thing that hits you besides the stench is the fact that all three stalls have had their doors removed. Personally i can understand that as its a deterrent for deals going down inside them and just people looking to fix up.  The toilet seats had also been removed which to this day I still cannot figure out. Your only option was to sit on the actual porcelain bowl that has lovingly been covered in a not so fine glaze of feces, piss and other organic materials that come forth from every orifice of the human body.  This was always a risky place to do anything shady as it was patrolled fairly often but I honestly didn't care and I had a friend stand by the door to the bathroom with the instructions to shout, ""Yo did you fall in or what bro?"" If a police officer happened to enter. I was pretty fast at fixing up back then as I still had nice juicy veins in my arms. Junkie Jesus wasn't on my side that day was my first thought a few moments later.

I'm sitting on the disgusting rim of the worst toilet in Manhattan as I'm ripping the top of my bags open with my teeth and dumping the contents into my metal cooker. Thinking myself as the ever so efficient and clever dope fiend, I had filled my rig with 25 units of water to cut down on the time I actually took to prep the shot.  What happened next will be instilled in my brain until the day I die. After sucking up the 3 bags I had just mixxedd into my brand new syringe  and having already put my bright blue rubber tourniquet on my left arm, I was all set to find a vein and let the beautiful love of my life ravage my circulatory system, I'm literally smacking my lips in anticipation. That was until I finally looked up and saw those shiny black boots facing my direction. I remember with great detail as my eyes slowly raised up and I took in the color of those dark blue pants and it didn't really register fully until my eyes evened out with his utility belt. A big dose of mother fucking reality smacked me to attention as the slow glancing up felt like an eternity looking back.  ""Put the needle down, right now."" 

It's now painfully obvious I've got a police officer standing maybe three feet away from myself who's sitting maybe two feet off the ground on a filthy toilet bowl rim. I've got a syringe loaded with heroin in my left hand and a bright sky blue tourniquet around my right bicep.  To really complete the scene I've got ripped open heroin bags and foil in my lap and surrounding me on the floor of the shit stained stall. Now we must not forget the syringe wrapper and dirty cooker that's caked in heroin residue. Looking back I'm not sure my brain was able to process how many charges I was looking at if we were to truly deconstruct this scene. 

""Put the needle down on the ground and place your hands on your head.""

I've not said a word and I keep looking at the syringe in my hand then back to his face of his hand testing on his holstered firearm. This back and forth of me staring at him and then my syringe like some kind of mentally challenged diabetic with trouble injecting his insulin. Time truly was slowed down but the one constant thing in my head was, ""I'm going to jail no matter what and there is no way I'm going sick."". There wasn't enough time to actually hit and find a vein on my tourniqueted arm (which was slowly going numb from lack of circulation) I looked at him one last time and he said something which might of been "" Don't.. "" 

I drove that rig right down into my thigh like some Nordic god wielding a mighty hammer into the ground. In my head the ground shook and dirt and rock went flying high, the officer knocked off his feet due to the sheer power of my downward swing. In reality though I just had a now emty 28 gauge half inch insulin syringe sticking out of the top of my left thigh while sitting in a foul and disgusting bathroom stall.

44utkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/44utkd/just_witnessed_a_tragedy/,88,https://redd.it/44utkd,dirty_doktor,Just witnessed a tragedy,"She wasn't my patient but I was called to her bed side because no one else was available last night.  I was covering emergencies on the floor while the day teams were home sleeping.

She told her nurse that she had the chest pain again.  Her nurse told me that her heart rate was alarmingly elevated and that she looked terrible.  I agreed--she was pale, dripping in cold sweat, and pulling hard to breath.  Oxygen, chest xray, EKG, enzymes, and aspirin.  The nurse dutifully enters my orders and I pull up her chart.

""NO ADDITIONAL OPIOIDS"" is emblazoned in the first line of the hand-off report.  She is an IV hydromorphone user now being maintained on methadone.  God forbid a dying woman trick you into helping her get high one last time.  IVDU, MRSA endocarditis, combo mitral / tricuspid / aortic valve replacement, prosthetic valve endocarditis, paraaortic abscess.  

She has already recovered from one heart infection, a very nasty one due to a virulent and drug resistant bacteria.  Six months prior, her heart surgeons had valiantly cracked her chest and carefully excised the infected parts before replacing them with pig valves.  They had stopped her heart for nearly two hours while they cut and sewed on it with the faith that they could restart it when their work was complete.  And they had.  She was fixed--for a time.

Her relapse was not more than three months after the initial surgery.  Straight back to injecting 8 mg diluadid tablets that are so popular among physicians here.  They believe that the abuse potential is less compared to oxycodone, which now has a bad reputation.  That's partially true, except for the fact that addicts here have taught each other how to crush and inject the pills.  This patient had learned the art from a friend who was trying to comfort her after her fiance's overdose death.

Now the same MRSA infection that ravaged her original heart valves had taken hold on the replacements.  Worse still, the infection had spread into the root of her aorta, the major artery leaving the heart, and a pocket of pus had formed.  This pocket would prove impossible to treat with IV antibiotics alone, as it shielded the bugs from the blood stream.  Slowly, the abscess was enlarging and without surgery, there was slim chance of cure.

The rule of thumb is that addicts only get one chance at heart surgery.  That's because the second heart operation is always more difficult and less successful than the first.  You have to hack through scar tissue and you have even less healthy heart to sew into.  After vavle replacement, we warn patients that their next relapse is likely to be fatal.

Was the sudden pain simply due to infection showering out of the abscess pocket and into the blood stream?  Maybe.  Equally plausible was the inside wall of the aorta dissecting away the muscular arterial wall.  The pain of an aortic dissection is a miserable way to die; there is no comfortable position and patients have told me it feels like they're being butchered from the inside.  Sometimes the dissection occludes other arteries and causes the loss of blood flow to an arm, resulting in ischemic limb pain or to the brain, which results in a stroke.

Maybe she had thrown a blood clot into the vessels of her lung.  A big clot causes not only unquenchable thrist for air but also a crushing chest pressure and impending sense of doom while the heart struggles to push against the obstruction to forward flow.  I've seen people with large clots literally turn blue in the face and start coughing up pinkish foam.

It's also possible that the abscess pocket had eroded straight throught the muscular wall of the heart and caused a massive leak of blood into the pericardial sack enveloping it.  This invariably leads to a situation where the heart is crushed under the pressure of its own blood.  Mericifully, these patients often loose consciousness quickly and die suddenly, but I imagine that the first moments of the process are a terror to experience.

I shared with her my concern for her wellbeing, but I was restrained in sharing my diagnostic considerations.  I felt it would be cruel to agonize her with gory details while she was critically ill and struggling to breathe.  Maybe she would have at peace knowing the many different ways that she could have died; perhaps they would be less frightening than her imagination.  Then again, I doubt she would even have been able to absorb those details in the moment.  

Really, I don't know what happened because it just happened so fast.  I stood by her bed for an hour.  There was little that I could offer, since she was so unstable and her pressure was dropping.  We started fluids.  We gave her oxygen.  She was coached on breathing.  My hands were tied, as she was not to recieve any opioids per her primary's orders; I impotently gave her a shot of anti-inflammatory medicine.  She asked me, in 2-3 words at a time, whether the heart surgeons could help her now; they had fixed the first infection.  I tried explaining it to her gently at first, but she just kept asking the same question.  Maybe it was the lack of perfusion to her brain or maybe it was the sickening realization that she had truly burned up her only ""second chance"" but she just couldn't accept my answer.  This was not a person who had made peace with their coming mortality; she pleaded with me using her terrified eyes that were wide open and white.

I had called the ICU and they were in the process of readying her bed when she lost her pulse.  Prior to this, she had slumped back and closed her eyes while still breathing heavily.  Her breathing slowed and a heart rate of 140 became 120 became 100 became 60 became 40, 38, 35, and then deteriorated into a riot of fibrillation on the monitor overhead.  Alarms exploded in the room.  Her nurse began to compress her chest to deliver CPR.  I opened her mouth with a cold steel laryngoscope and inserted a plastic breathing tube in her airway.  We did the mechanical work of her lungs and heart while the electrical storm raged inside her.  She was compressed and shocked three times before flatlining on the monitor.  By now, the ""code blue"" had attracted a veritable circus of late night gawkers and Rescue Randys eager for some macabre entertainment or the chance to feel big by ""saving a life.""  I ran the code for half an hour before we noticed bloodly froth in her breathing tube.   Her heart never regained a beating rhythm and by then her brain was likely irrevocably damaged.  I pronounced her dead and the traveling circus packed up and left.

She was 36 years old.  She was a mother of two children.  She was more than an IV drug user, but that was her defining feature here in the hospital none-the-less.  The only way I know how to express myself is to say that I am saddened by the inequity that led to her death.  If she had access to opioid replacement therapy or, failing that, clean needles and filters, then she might not have died such a miserable death as a spectacle for disinterested strangers in a sterile hospital room.  She made mistakes, but why did those mistakes have to cost her life?  

Life is unfair.  That's what I saw written with her pleading eyes.  But I also might have seen a reflection of myself--reminding me to have sympathy for the unlucky in life.  I could just as easily have been in the hospital gown in her place.  That's sobering.

First off I do have a substantial habit ranging anywhere from a half to two grams of ECP daily.. Just a little background information. Obviously with a habit like that and no job one will occasionally have to fend off the shakes from time to time. When I'm staring that  black abyss in the face there is only one answer: poor man's methadone. 

I start by taking 800 mg of cimetidine  (generic Tagamet). This is always a debated step with many people saying that it does nothing, in my experience it makes all the difference. 

Wait: 45 minutes 

Take 48 mg of Loperamide 

Wait 2 hours 

Feel MUCH better. Now let me be clear here, you will not feel like you just did a gram of some serious shit, but the histamine reactions such as running eyes and nose will disappear or be greatly reduced as well as restlessness shivers shakes and general uncomfortableness.

One thing that I do feel I should mention is that on the occasions that I have eaten foods heavy and black pepper I have felt severe CNS depression it's something to watch out for.

Got dropped off at my main guys house as its on the way to my lifts work . I couldn't get a hold of him on the phone so I was taking a chance as £10 bags aren't really sold any more it's all half Gs for £20 give the door a chap and his mom answers as he fell out with his missus and has been living there he last week I don't think she was going to let me in at first as she didn't recognise me  but I reminded her I sat with her and her son for a couple of hours on Wednesday and lituary saw the light bulb go off in her head and she lets me in .

  When I go in he's completely out of it and is sitting Buddha style on the carpet. Not a good position to nod out as I know someone that list the use of both legs for about 6 months through nerve damage and he was lucky to regain use of them. So I wake him up and he's abit non compus mentus but comes round in a couple of minutes and ask him to do me a tenner bag . He asks me if times are tough as I was only wanting a tenner bag and reply yip they are indeed . Then he asks me if I want a half G and can pay it when I've got it so I take him up on his offer . Then he says oh shit I wouldn't have offers you that until I know what I'm working with so he weighs out what he's got and says it's no problem 😊 
   Once he's made it up I say to him I'm not being ignorant but I've got to go as the bus was due and make my excuses and leave . I run to the bus stop and relise his clock was 10 minutes fast so I've got another 5 minutes till the bus comes and they run every hour after 6pm which is a pain in the arse ! 
    Get home and cook up a charge and here I am . I've included a pic of my eye pinned and if anyone else wants to post a pic of their pinned eyes that would be cool 😄 Also included a couple of pics of my Groom which will be ready in a couple of weeks... I can't fucking wait !!! Probably going to get myself a nice half Oz of dope 😊

As soon as I saw/smelled it I knew what I was dealing with and I was right! I know good #4 -- I don't however know much about IV. I plug/snort all the time but yest. was my first time with IV.

So me being very curious to try it (and being very depressed about my familial situation atm) went ahead bought a couple of 1cc 30 gauge rigs, qtips, drew up my hit, wasn't very accurate with measurement but it was several shots of a little less than half of the rig (throughout the day not all at once).

My questions are this:

1) Is it normal for vision to be quite  cross-eyed and blurry for 20-25 minutes after the shot?

2) How would you know if you skin popped or hit directly? OR is there not a way ..

3) Is it OK that I can't control the nod, like I literally can't open my eyes no matter how hard I try.

3) Lastly the first shot I was sitting at my desk, took 3 .5 mg Kpins with it and literally fell face down on my keyboard and woke up 2 hours later not knowing what happened. My hand was numb as hell. Could this have been an OD or just a normal nod out?

Sorry for so much but this is serious territory and I would like to be educated somewhat. Thx

I haven't posted on here before, mostly commented and benefited from the support I found here.
   Something terrible happened. My SO and I started using again back in early November. We were both addicted to opiates before and had been sober( me over 10 years with one tiny slip up, and him only a few months) when we met and started our relationship. One thing led to another. We started with 30's and 15's, then escalated quickly to my now beloved H. It had always been his DOC, but I had never tried it. I was always squeamish with needles and never considered shooting up. But, I wanted to feel what he felt, so I begged him to do it to me.
   Needless to say, it was love at first rush.
   Like I said, things got bad fast. We sold everything we could get our hands on. I lost my job for using the company credit card unauthorized.  We went thru my 5,000.00 severance $ in less than a month. With bills still due and no money in sight. I was denied unemployment. THEN. We decided to STOP. We were broke and banged up to say the least.
   We tried the poppy tea to ease the craving. It helped, but we ran out. So, he decides to order that U-47700. I loved it at first, but quickly realized that I was going into severe withdrawals within hours! He did too, and refused to shoot me anymore. (I can't do myself). I went thru 24 hours of HELL, then I started feeling OK. BUT he would NOT STOP. I begged, I hid the shit, I tried to wrestle it from him. He is alot bigger and stronger than me. HE WOULDN'T STOP!!!!!
   So, I started stealing little lines and snorting it. It tore my nose up and made me sick, but I couldn't completely stop either. This went on for 6 days, and he finally decided to detox. I was encouraging and told him, it's just 24 hours and you will be OK. His arms are a bloody mess and he had been shooting in his groin! He made it past the 12 hour mark and we knew it was safe to take a Xan. I am prescribed those. I told him, sleep it off n you'll be fine. Meanwhile, I take 1 Xan, which is alot for me. I am also suffering from a sinus infection, so without thinking much about it, I take Tylenol Cold and Flu.  
   I wake up at 5am yesterday and he is fucking out of his head. He had got up and shot that shit on top of those Xans!!!!!!!!!!! He was falling stumbling, zombie eyed. I'm like WTF???????????
   I get so pissed, I try to steal the shit, and he forcibly takes it back. I'm yelling, how stupid can you fucking be???? Are you trying to kill yourself????????
   So, he has a bunch in a spoon, and I snort it.
   The next thing I know, I wake up surrounded by ambulance people, I am half-naked and the cops are milling around my bedroom. Apparently, he couldn't wake me up and called 911!!!!!!
   Now the part, I need support. The cops took him. They yanked him away from me. He had a warrant for fugitive from justice for a probation violation. He's in jail. No bond.
   I'm so alone. I want to die. WTF. Why did he call fucking 911??? That automatically brings the fucking cops. You don't call the fucking cops",1455112351.0

No it isn't a dealer in the 'burbs or a shady guy on the corner. It's actually someone not even in Australia but China. It's not even through the Darknets but on the good ole' clearnet. 

A littl background I'm 21, I have scoliosis, which causes extreme nerve pain and have a herniated disk because of it. I go to the physio twice a week, but I'm a drug addict in the system so ever getting proper prescribed pain killers is unlikely although I am trying. I'm currently prescribed: Lyrica, 300mg twice daily, 2.5mg of diazepam and 5mg of methadone (been reducing from 120mg) because fuck going to dose 4 days a week. 

Anyway! So I'm supplementing with Fentanyl-analogues. No I don't volumetric dose and no I don't even have scales. (Fucking reckless I know but it's a bit of a stretch living with parents to do.) moving out next week however so I'll be doing it. I currently use FIBF. A newer analogue of pfbf. It actually lasts a lot longer then any other Fent analogue I've used. I get analgesia for around 4 hours, and dose 3x daily. It's not very euphoric compared to say fentanyl itself or furanyl fentanyl but the long duration makes it perfect. I use approx 4-6mg a day. At approx $90usd a gram it makes complete sense to me. And has been a god send for my pain. Even though all analogues are illegal here in Australia. It's been a god send. I don't IV it, only insufflation.

&nbsp;

I'll start (my apologies if you read my comment in another thread):


&nbsp;

I was at a job (career type job, not fry cook or whatever--not that there's anything wrong with honest work), doing more than full time nights. That included some 3pm-7am double shifts. Being a single parent, I was wiped. Well, one night, manager came in for night shift (she usually bounced out by 5pm for the day) for an impromptu meeting at 8:30. Well, I did more than a couple of those really long blinks. Manager pulled me aside and asked what was up. I was honest and apologized, and explained that I was exhausted. No problem, right? 


&nbsp;

Wrong. Next day, she called me and told me that, after working there 10 months, it just wasn't working out. She then informed me that she was concerned, and offered to give me the number to a local detox/rehab facility. I told her I wasn't an addict, and begged for a drug test. She refused. 


&nbsp;

The bitch of it? This was years ago when I only very occasionally popped a 10mg oxy. I'm talking about once every 2-4 MONTHS. I would have peed clean as a newborn baby. BUT, apparently, one of my coworkers had just been fired for drinking on the job, and I guess it was fresh in their minds, and/or they didn't want to deal with the headache of dealing with an addict. Unfortunately for me, I live in a ""Right to Hire"" (read: right to fire) state, and so off I went. 


&nbsp;

And since that didn't really count seeing as how my drug use ironically didn't get me into trouble, more recently (last month) I went to work after a 4 day heroin binge. Not being truly addicted, more of a comfortable chipper, and never experiencing more than a decent case of the shits, I thought I'd be okay. 


&nbsp;

Fast forward to 4 hours into my 13 hour shift, putting me at around 9 or 10 hours after my last hit, and I am fucked up. My eyes and nose are dripping like a busted faucet. My pupils are so big that I look like a goddam PowerPuff girl. I'm shitting my fucking brains out, literally running to the toilet every 5-15 minutes. I've got the cold sweats, I'm irritable as a motherfucker, and I'm yawning like I haven't slept in weeks. Coworkers could clearly tell that something was up. 


&nbsp;

Okay, I'm thinking to myself, calm down. It's right after New Year's, just tell everyone you partied a little too hard for the holiday and you're hung over. Coworkers were mostly in their 30s and frequently bragged about getting drunk on the weekends, blah blah blah.  Stupid rookie mistake, because the first person who asks me wtf is wrong, and I say that to, looks at me like I'm crazy and asks ""Partied?? With what?!"" and tells me her brother is a junkie and this is *exactly* what he looked like before they shipped him off to Florida to get clean. Specially mentions my pupils, which I'd been hoping weren't as noticeable to everyone else. So I stammered and came up with a ""Just drinking! We went out to a bar last night, that's all. And, well my sister has the flu, and she slept over the other night. I think that's what I'm coming down with maybe?"". 

&nbsp;

Nope. I'm pretty sure she narc'ed on me, cuz an hour later, people are whispering, and Big Boss Man is walking up to me. He tells me I can take a drug test or resign. I decide to pee, and BBM walks me literally across the street to the lab. The whole time I'm praying to JJ that it's somehow clean (and I'd been drinking water all day trying to alleviate the WDs, so I'm thinking maybe it'll be diluted enough). 

&nbsp;

Nope. They send me home for the day, telling me they'll lmk when the results are back. Monday morning, my heart stops when the number shows up on my caller ID.  I pissed hot. Duh.  Now I'm begging him, explaining that it must be the Percocet I took ""the other day"" for knee pain, and I have the script for it and everything. 

&nbsp;

Nope. Different metabolites, obviously. I knew that, but was either in denial, or just hoping that I could fool them, or whatever. So, bye bye, $30/hr job with benefits, hello shitty reputation not only at that job, but every site that the company owns (which is literally about half of the locations in my specialty in a 50+ mile radius of my home). And unemployment insurance didn't look kindly on my reason for being fired, as you can imagine. 

&nbsp;

Fuck me, how I wish I would have known to just call in sick that day. Funny thing is, the only reason I didn't was because I hadn't been there very long and didn't want to get in trouble. 

&nbsp;

So there are my stories. Anyone else? ",1455083576.0

Me and Blake were both fresh out of rehab and he had a brother who was still using back in Virginia.

 His brother was a decently big (6'2 and 200 pounds) mixed kid, who was convinced white people were scared of him. He ran out of shit and had always thought it would be easy to rob a pharmacy. Not at night mind you, just walk in and demand the oxys and dilaudid.

So he did just that, walked in with his hand in his pocket to pretend like he had a gun. ""Gimme all the pills or I'm gonna start killing all these old white people"". Sure enough he got the pills, that was all it took. He called his brother that night and bragged to us about it, we couldn't believe he'd actually gone through with something so stupid.

A few days go by and Blake hasn't heard from his brother, and is worried as the cops most likely know it was him as he didn't wear a mask or anything and they had pictures of him on the news. He had one of his friends break into his house and they found him dead. Overdosed and surrounded by pills.

Now there was no point to this story, just bored, a little high, and thought I would share with you guys a terrible story from my time in recovery. Also sorry I know I have the fucking writing skills of a second grader.

However, we fail to remember that people can occasionally dabble in opiates without becoming a full blown addict, just like many people can enjoy the occasional cigarette/cigar/hookah without becoming a full blown smoker. It seems like no one in /r/opiates agrees. 

For me, I do Poppy Seed Tea every now and then. I've also done H a couple times. I also have popped a hydro here and there when it was around. However, I don't find them THAT enjoyable to where I can do it every day. Hell, I don't even like to smoke weed every day like I  used to anymore. I just like enjoy the occasional opiate just like I enjoy the occasional MDMA, mushroom, acid, DMT, and even cocaine. When I do an opiate, it's PST 99% of the time, which is usually once maybe twice a week MAX. Hell, the last time I did PST was over 2 weeks ago. I ended up having a 5lb bag of poppy seeds that I didn't even use for 2 weeks. It just sat there for a while, then I decided to make some yesterday.

The reason why I'm making this post on successful chipper awareness is because I made a PST post here, in that thread I mentioned that I wasn't a regular opiate user. In that thread, this dude commented on my thread saying my statement on occasional use was ""Every junkie's last words as a normie."" I then told him to not be judgemental, and taking the occasional opiate is possible. I do cocaine socially from time to time, but I'm not a cocaine addict, and I've been a occasional cocaine user for 4 years now. However, my comment got downvoted into oblivion. ",1455078458.0

Names and locations have been changed obviously. But this is in fact a true story and it's about what an idiot I was and all the crazy shit that addiction can make you do. Enjoy? 


By late May I was drowning in addiction. Eighteen years old and at a two bundle a day IV heroin addiction, only two things really mattered to me: money and dope. 

So when I got the call from Ben late one Tuesday night with a lucrative proposition, I answered to that call. Sitting in his room, we hatched a plan:

"" All I'm saying is The kid's got 15k in his safe man"" 

""Yeah but you're also saying he's got guns in the house, and you don't know if they're gonna be near him!"" 

It was around this point Ben decided to pull out his fathers chrome .38 six shot. 

""Ben, what the fuck"" 

""Chill, I got one for you too, it's Ori's 12 gauge, we can use it if we give him $500 after"" 

""Are you for real about this? Or are you just bullshitting like you usually do?""

""I'm dead fucking serious. You don't even know the kid! It's a quick, in and out, less than 5 minutes type deal""

""So many things could go wrong, are you not even going to think about what could actually happen?"" 

""Listen, I was gonna do this by myself anyway, the only reason I asked you is because you're the  only other kid I know whos even held a gun....plus were gonna need to use your dirt bike."" 

Now it was at this point I was thinking about how much heroin I could buy with that kind of money. Ben was a pill head, and he wasn't as full blown as I was, but I knew we were thinking just how much junk we could buy if we pulled something like this off. 

I've never been a stick-up kid, I was living in a small New England town with good people and a good upbringing, but the desperation of addiction toyed with my head, and in this instance it didn't take long for money to replace principles. 

After much deliberation we decided to split the booty 40/50 since Ben had a source for this info and wanted a finders fee.

 What we were after was a kid named Connor. Connor, from what I was told, was making a name for himself as the high schools main pot dealer in the next town over. He talked at liberty about his money and his drugs, so much so that an aqaintance of his had grown either tired and/or jealous of Connor and decided to plant the idea of robbing the kid to numerous other characters who had the balls to do something like that. one of those people being dear old Ben. 

The date was set. I blacked out my dirt bike and together we would ride over, camp out in the woods behind his house, and wait for him to get home from school. We knew the house would be empty before that. So on that early summer afternoon, I loaded up with a fat shot of dope, loaded the 12 gauge and climbed onto my bike with Ben on the back. 

We arrived at the house and hid in the woods. 20 minutes later we see a car pull in, and out hops Connor along with who I could only assume was one of his buddies. 

We decided to let him get comfortable for ten minutes. His bedroom had an outside door with direct access. Ben agreed to go first, with the understanding that I would guard the doors and keep a gun trained on his buddy. 

We snuck to the window and I peeped in. They were playing call of duty. Bingo. I whisper this to Ben and he says on the count of three. Ski masks were pulled down. This was it. 

BAM! 

The door goes flying open. Ben roars: ""Get on the fucking ground! On the ground fuckboy!!!!"" No going back now. I step inside and raise the shotgun on the other kid. ""don't move"" I say flatly.

Connor mutters,""you fucking cocksuckers""

The other kid is expressionless. He keeps still. 

After a lot of cussing and a threats from Ben, Connor produces a key. 

""Don't you even think about moving"" said Ben as he moved over to a small safe under the TV. 

I moved back into the doorway to keep them both in my sights.

Sure enough, Ben opens the safe and we find a QP of kush along with three fat stacks of mixed bills. Had to give props to Connor, he was definitely stacking and wasn't lying about his shit.  

After we loaded the shit into a backpack, I gave Ben the 12 gauge and he kept the gun on them while I brought around the bike. The getaway involved bombing it a half mile down the back roads of our town into a trail network that would take us back to Bens place 5 miles away through the woods. 

I pull the bike up. Bens last words were ""try us and you die"". He hops on quick and we pull off, the 250cc two stroke screaming as we hit 80 down the road. We left them without even touching them. 

We got back to Bens place safe and to this day, no one ever found out about what we did that day. I never saw Connor again. The respective parties who knew anything got their cuts and kept they're mouths shut. 

In total we ended up with $13,760. Plus just over a QP of Kush. 
My cut ended up being an even 5 grand. That might not be a lot of money for some but in my neck of the woods where everyone is dirt poor, it was like winning the powerball. 

I wish I could say I spent it wisely.  I didn't. Almost all that money went up my arm. I was and still am a sick person. I came out the other side of that money with an even worse habit. Some days I was doing up to 3 bundles. It lasted me 3 months. 

This was almost 5 years ago. I've been clean for 2 years with a few slips here and there. I went on to college, got a job in environmental engineering and am overall successful. Living clean is wonderful. You just need to stick it out for a solid 6 months. After that, you will feel born again. I promise! 
 
Ben went on to college and is now a fitness coach for a handful of B-list celebrities. 

I haven't forgotten where I came from however, ive done bad things. So I'm going to leave this bit of my history for you guys to enjoy and hopefully laugh at.

Died in his bedroom at 6:06pm central.

He was 31 and leaving behind a daughter, fiancé, and newborn son.

Dude was an alright guy. Big heavy corn fed Texas boy. 

He had been addicted to Benzos since high school. 

Recently got in a horrific car wreck back around Christmas of 14, and subsequently was given copious amounts of opioids from a writing Doctor we all know of.

Not sure of the specifics, but I do know he would have seizures from not getting Xanax, and he recently began taking the oxys he sold, along with seroquel.

Interested to see if it ends up ruled a suicide, or just overdosed.

I know this girl, not intimately, but we have some of the same friends -especially on Facebook. The thing that bothers me, is some of these people are berating her, and commenting some really fucked up things. To her and her mom. Reality check, though. This could be me. This is what happens. I would get the same treatment. No shit she fucked up big time, but why is it a sport to attack the addicts? Sure, you choose to stick a needle in your arm the consequences are pretty damn serious.. But, it's disgusting the level people will stoop to humiliate another human. Small towns can be brutal with out help, but there's that video that will follow her and her family for a long time. Yeah, maybe this is/should be her wakeup call, but realistically it probably won't be, so all those tough love/hateful comments about her life are definitely not going to take her anywhere but down.

Sorry if this post is all over the place.

I'm glad she made it. I hope she finds what she needs to balance her life. I hope she wants to help herself.

I'm not even sure what I'm looking to get out of this post, possibly just an overall better understanding from the ones involved. I would like to use any knowledge gained here to better support people I meet in a compassionate and understanding way, while still performing my duties.

Well, here's the thing. There's no ""proof"" he actually rents here, so he couldn't prove his address with the police. They said they have to come here to search his stuff, to prove he lives here (I know, barely makes any sense. Seems like they're trying to bust him for something, but also doesn't make sense cause he doesn't fuck with drugs).

Here's the thing. I rent out part of the house too. My room *reeks* of bud from smoking/holding a couple zips in there. I cleaned out my room and out all illegal things I know of in a van outside. Still smells

I put up two pieces of paper. One on his door saying "" (renters name)'s room"" , and one on the wall by my door (right where u start smelling bud, you'd have to walk all the way over there tho) ""this is NOT a shared space. A renter rents this room! I do not consent to searches or siezures"".....I know kinda doing the most but I'm trying to stay safe if they were to try to search my shit.

There is 3 roommates here. Me being one. We never signed a lease. We have a relationship with the ""landlord"" (my friends mom) and live with their family here. I just don't know what else to do at this point. I researched online a bit about it, and it said they can only search ""shared"" spaces, which my room is not, and why I put the paper on the door/wall... Any advice?



Also, just to note. I doubt they'll even come by, but on that off chance that they do (since they said they are, and my ""landlord"" told me they are searching his room)  does anyone know my rights? Can I just stand out front my door the whole time , or in my room, and if any officer steps a foot in my room tell them to GTFO out I don't consent to a search?

Ohh man, I finally got high after waiting 3 weeks and letting my bundles sit for 2 days because I didn't have a rig. I woke up, walked to a Rite Aid because Google said they opened at 8am. The store opened at 8 but the pharmacy doesn't open until 9. A mile and a half walk for no reason. Sad face. I ended up finding a needle exchange van, signed up and got a little bag of supplies. After 3 weeks and holding a bundle for a few days. Every second was magical, I filled up the little cooker and put some water in that thing. I found a nice vein and registered, saw that beautiful sight of crimson life flow into the rig and pushed. As that wonderful warmth flowed over my body and felt like heaven. HAPPY FACE!!!

So I'm deciding to take one for a few months to try it out and slow down a bit, save some cash, get into better shape, stay sober etc.

The one questions my DR has not answered is the effect on tolerance.

It's been months since I've heard from a very close friend. Our relationship is tumultuous and has been for years, but none the less he means a lot to me. He has struggled with getting clean for the past 7 years but this year has been the worst. We used to date, and he actually introduced me to iving dope, injecting me for months before I could do it myself. Like most addicts, he has some underlying mental problems that make him so cold and detached. Sometimes I wonder if he is just suffering all of the time and dope is the only thing that makes him feel well, even if the feeling is forever fleeting. Hell I cant say that I don't have similar feeling myself. Anyway I digress. We got into an argument because I'm having a hard time emotionally investing myself in his crazy life when he is such am asshole to me most of the time. A few months ago I stopped taking to him, stopped answering his calls. One day I just knew to call him, bc sometimes you know when someone you love needs you. His voice mail picked up right away, and has been doing so for the past two months. I'm worried. The t is that he is in rehab, again. I feel such guilt for not being there to support him. Why do I feel so guilty about that? Honestly bc I don't know what I would do if he died without telling him that he is loved. Unfortunately I have this same worry about all of my closest friends. I literally worry everyday that I will get that phone call letting me know that one of my dearest friends is gone. Do I think that they will he going to a better place? Idk. What I do know is that I hate the idea of their last experiences being such hardship. Although some people can use and keep their shit together, such as myself, most people can't and their lives turn into a long dark night of the soul.

*Heads up: Sorry guys if this one isnt as exciting as my other stories. I got another story in the works that's much better.*

**Burger King**

Soon after I got arrested, I started living with my friend James. I lost my car after the police confiscated it and was holding it ransom. My customers would come to me, but since I couldn't drive to my supplier, and James was still selling, I thought it would be weird to buy off him, then have my customers buy off of me at his house.

I was 20 years old and the only place I worked at was a roofing company that was run by James's dad, and a short time at Best Buy. So I applied everywhere. A short distance from my house was a Burger King. They called me a few days after I applied. When I came in for the interview, the store manager was a hot blond that wasn't much older than me, and the assistant manager was a short gay guy. I basically got the job because I told them that I lived close by and I could work any hours.

I later found out that the hot blond manager was 25 and got the job because her mom was the district manager - her name was Melissa. For the first couple of weeks, I took everything seriously as I could. I would only do blues before work, and never enough to make me nod.
One of my better friends got a job at a different Burger King, and as soon as he heard that I was working at one, he put in a transfer to work at mine.

They had me working the opening shifts, and the majority of the workers were part-time high school kids that had restrictions on the hours and times they could work, so the opening shift was usually me, and a manager. One morning the assistant manager came and opened the store, made sure I had everything I needed and told me Melissa would be in within 15 minutes, and he was leaving. An hour went by and she didn't show up and she wasn't answering her phone. It started to get busy so I called the assistant manager - he told me to call the manager at a nearby store. 

The nearby store manager said he couldn't help me, but I should call the district manager. I called that number and the district manager's boss answered (the regional manager). I told him the situation, and he said he would be down in 30 minutes. 30 minutes later he took off his suit shirt and put on a regular employee shirt, and started making sandwiches, asking questions when we got a free minute about Melissa - basically sizing up if this was a regular thing and if she was a good manager - which for the most part she was. Melissa came in about an hour later, and as the regional manager was leaving, he talked to me in private outside and told me if this or anything like this ever happens again, to call him directly and gave me his personal number.

Apparently Melissa was late because her husband never came home the night before, and in the morning they found his truck sitting on the side of the road - but they still haven't found him. After everything calmed down Melissa sat in the manager office most of the day. I was the de facto manager for the day.

A few weeks later James and I moved further away from the store. James's dad was living with us too, and he had a car so he could take me to and from work some days, and other days I could take the bus. It had been a little over a month from when Melissa's husband went missing, and still no sign of him. The downside of having to ride a bus was that the bus service only ran so late, so I couldn't close the store unless I had a ride home. This day a few workers called in, so Melissa asked if I could work double and close, and she would give me a ride home. I told her no problem. The only issue I had with that is that I was almost out of alcohol. I would fill up a cup before my shift started, and when I got to work I would mix it with soda and ice when I got there and drink that during the day. This shift I would just have to go without.

My friend Tyson was now working with me most shifts, and he decided to stay a few hours after to help us - but around midnight, his mom came and picked him up, so it was just me and Melissa until 2 AM. Luckily it was a slow night, and Melissa and I were talking to pass the time. At 2 AM we closed the store, and we both walked out to her truck for the ride home. The ride home she talked about her husband, and how it was unusual for him to just not show up. She passed the road that I lived on, and after I few minutes I told her and she said she forgot. She asked if I mind if we stopped by her house first since we were almost there anyways, and of course, I told her I didn't.

We pulled up to her driveway, and she started balling crying. I didn't know what to do, so I hugged her and told if everything will be fine. She asked to walk her inside, so I did, and when I got inside, she told me she would be right back as she walked into her room. She came back out of her work clothes and was in booty shorts that showed off her nice ass and a tank top that showed her boobs equally well. She knew I noticed, and she thanked me for consoling her and gave me a hug. Soon after she snuck in a kiss and we were making out.

She led me into her bedroom, where the first thing I noticed were pictures of her husband on the nightstand lit underneath by the desktop lamp. She took off her shirt revealing that she wasn't wearing a bra, and the picture quickly vanished from memory. We fucked and she brought me home around 5 in the morning.

I was now her boy toy and she would purposely schedule me to close with her so she could take me home. It started getting obvious and Tyson would tease me about it, and I would remind him back that his girlfriend was fat and that would usually shut him up. One of the girls that worked with us, Rachel,  told me a few weeks after working there that she liked me. She had a decent body, but one of her eyes was crossed, so she constantly wore her hat low to try to conceal it. I told her I was looking to date, anyone.

Tyson told me that his mom and step-dad was out of town and he had the house to himself. I told him I was getting alcohol and I was heading over after work. Somehow Rachel got wind and asked if she could go. I gave her the address. After work, I managed to get a couple twelve back of beer and a bottle of cheap vodka. Tyson immediately started doing shots and chased it with a mix of vodka and coke. I stuck to the beer, as did Rachel.

I was on my 8th or 9th beer and Rachel pulled me off to the side and we started making out. We moved to Tyson's moms bed and Rachel started giving me head. As I was putting the condom on, she said if I wanted to go any further, I had to go out with her - we were both half naked on the bed, half drunk and I was in the middle of putting a condom on - I would've told her anything.

We started fucking and Tyson started pounding on the door.

*Tyson* ""Critical, I thought you said we were both going to fuck her - open the door!""

*Oops - I might've said something like that to get him to let me use his mom's room*

We continued to fuck as Tyson got louder and drunker until his speech was hardly recognizable. We opened the door and he was laying next to it, head drooped and just about to spill his drink. I helped him onto the couch, and I passed out on the loveseat.

Morning came and he had one of his friends that had a car come pick me, Rachel and Tyson up. After we got in the car, she asked if we were dating now. I flatly told her no. Nobody said anything. We pulled up to her house, and as she was getting out, she called me a liar and said she wouldn't have slept with me if I told her I didn't want to date her. And I told her that's why I told her that. Everyone in the car started laughing.

I told Melissa what happened and she mostly scheduled different shifts for me and Rachel. Melissa also said that we had to stop seeing each other, which lasted about 2 weeks - we continued to see each other until I quit - and then 1 more time after. I don't know if her husband was ever found.

Working at Burger King was one of the most fun places I've ever worked. I could get away with just about anything. Tyson eventually got busted smoking weed behind the dumpster, but they didn't fire him until he did it 2 more times.

Here is this week:","...Never danced like this before. Shouldn't talk about it.

The surroundings of my apartment had become crushingly familiar. The foux wood patterns on the closet door mocked my pain. The month's worth of expended clothes that littered my shag carpet floor perfumed me in the past month's worries, seeping out of every polyester thread. I wore exclusivly long sleeves now. For me, it had been a lifetime of a winter.

Shouldn't think about it.

The TV, a family heirloom from yore, played a movie from my small collection. This one was about a man in Hawaii with his ex. The calming backdrop against the man's petty turmoil suited me. I had, of course, seen it before. It seemed that these days I only did two things anymore...shouldn't think about it...and one of them was watch my collection of 17 movies over and over. I could quote most of them. 

The flash of the TV was the only thing illuminating my loft apartment, and still it was too much illumination for my liking. No clocks, digital or otherwise, competed with the darkness. I detested clocks, as they only served to measure my chaotic state. Shouldn't think about it. Blankets soaked through with sweat, the fouton springs creaked as endlessly as I shifted. My legs seemed to be hooked up to a gas generator. Invading monsters at the foot of my bed would have my feet to contend with.

There is a place in most people's homes that they seal off as a quarantine zone. A junk drawer, a toiletries cabnet, old financial papers. Any place that they'd rather pretend didn't exist. Life was just easier to shun the calamities and face the sun. My quarantine zone was a corner of my kitchen, on the counter, and throughout the appliances. Little shamefull treasures and tools hidden from prying eyes. Shouldn't think about it. It was these treasures which tormented me. Like ancient sailors called overboard by beautiful sirens, the corner beckoned me. Shouldn't think about it! Shouldn't think about it!

My legs were moving again, kicking imaginary spirits as they soared to devour me. My nose ran, my mouth tasted copper. The creeky springs in my fouton became rocks. All my joints screamed as if being worn away by a belt sander. The crooks of my arms burned the way a runners lungs do at the end of a marathon. It's not natural to fight one's survival instincts so hard. Every inch of my body was commanding me to make it stop. My thoughts betrayed me, my memories burned the most. Memories of a time when ""comfort"" and ""at ease"" and ""satisfied"" still carried relevance. Now the words were immaterial, a whisp of a legend of a myth.

In actuality Hell is playing with your mind the way a child plays with ants and a magnifying glass. Hell is being ones own iron maiden. Hell is knowing a moment of pure bliss, and being doomed to ever roam the underworld realm of mediocre joy. I'll never dance like that again.

I just have a few questions about how I should go about doing this.

1. Since liver enzymes are being inhibited, is the acetaminophen more likely to cause damage to my liver? I.E. Is it necessary to perform a CWE?

2. Normally I would take the full 30-35mg, but should I lower the dose if I use this method? How much? 

3. I do not currently have any Tums, but would Zantac work as a viable substitute for an antacid?

A few questions:

1. How long should it take the average person to sniff 10 bags and not waste any via post-nasal drip?

2. For a habit that's on average about 12 bags a day (insufflated), does 2mg sound like a good dose to induce (I have a whole bottle of benzos) ?

3. I understand that most individuals have different opinions on this, but has lope ever caused you PWD (please only answer this question if you've mixed the two before)?

4. If I somehow end up in PWD (or am in w/d from not taking sub at a high enough dose) would an immediate re-dosing of more sub cure my ailment or cause PWD in itself?

5. If anyone has any tips for easing into w/d or keeping level-headed to prevent relapse (not forever, just for a few days so I'm not physically dependent on opiates), please feel free to share.

Basically I tried to make poppy tea 6 days ago and I have a urine test coming up the day after tomorrow. However I'm feeling a bit strange, light-headed and uncoordinated which may or may not be due to stress and lack of sleep. What do you think my chances are of passing the test? Should I call in sick instead and do it on Monday? That would give me 11 days instead of 8.

I'm worried some fucked up component of the tea is still active and giving me these feelings, maybe it shows up as opiates on the test? I'm thinking thebaine, oripavine or something else. I used one pod (from the garden, unknown variety) and it was my first time with opiates. FYI I have had diarrhea since I was informed about the test (scared shitless), so that prolly indicates it's not opiates acting up.

I currently work in the corporate financial world and have been at my job for some time -- I work my ass off but don't feel truly appreciated or rewarded at my current job.

I have a reasonably sized dope habit and have been a daily user for more than 4 years. What I want to know is that if switch to subs (i have done it before) and have a suboxone prescription from a Dr. in my name and when I am tested that (subs) is the only thing in my system - can that negatively affect me or my results of the test in any way? My apologies if this seems like stupid question - I would like to think that if I have a prescription and am taking a drug as legally prescribed of course that is OK and the testing company would give my company the ""all clear"" because there are no illegal drugs in my system.. but I don't know why I am doubting it, I am just anxious about this opportunity and don't want my habit to get in my way of succeeding professionally... Does anyone have this same experience? My understanding is because of the ""confidential"" nature of medical records the testing lab cannot disclose to the company what prescriptions I am currently taking and if nothing besides the drugs I am prescribed show up in the test I am good to go, right? I tend to think irrationally and worry to the extreme about things, so I need all of you guys to set me straight... I just am afraid because of the ""stigma"" associated with Subs and the reason why they are usually prescribed can companies ask labs to alert them if Subs show up in a test?

&nbsp;

My longtime partner sold the last of his subs to pay his car insurance and gas to get to court (he's on probation in drug court right now with 4 felonies and a bunch of misdemeanors). He was supposed to be able to get a refill on Tuesday, but the fucking doctor was out sick, won't be back until MONDAY. I get it, shit happens. But you need to have a back up plan. There are NPs and PAs and other doctors in that practice. You can't leave people sick like this. 

&nbsp;

Not to mention, I'm no Dr, obviously, but he had my guy on three 8mg subs per day (he'd really take either 2 or 3 per day, depending on how bad of a day it was, plus this way he could sell some, as it's almost impossible to get a job with his current legal issues). That was for an oxy addiction with occasional heroin use towards the end, before everything came crashing down. He wasn't even in WDs when he was prescribed them. He was over a month out! Fucking Dr told him it'd help with the cravings. Smdh. Started with 8mg/day. My guy still wanted to use after 2 weeks on that dose, so Dr upped it to 16mg/day. Dude still wished he could eat a handful of oxy after 2 weeks on *that*, so genius Dr changed it to 24mg/day. What the fucking fuck?? Ugh. Just pisses me off. 

&nbsp;

He's really hurting right now, and it's killing me. And to top it off, the poor jerk is deathly allergic to lope. As in, throat closes. 

&nbsp;

He's begging me for the few oxy I have left. I'd give it to him in a heartbeat, but if his PO comes by for a random (which he does somewhat regularly), he'll piss hot and go directly to jail. The judge could then kick him out of drug court, and he would be looking at minimum 8 years in state for his charges. I doubt the judge would do that, he seems like an honestly good guy, but my man would be remanded for at least 2 weeks in county. 

&nbsp;

The somewhat good part is that he now realizes that suboxone is no damn joke, and he thinks he's going to just say fuck it and not go back on after dealing with this. The subs aren't a condition of his probation or of drug court.

**Mescaline:**

This happened when James and I were around 16 years old. James was still in school, but I already got kicked out and they wouldn't let me back (another story). I was work with James's dad from time to time doing roofing, and James would too on his days off. We also had a family friend named Frank that was partially disabled but had money and a large piece of land that always had work to do, so he would sometimes pick us up and pay us to do menial work - but would usually take us out to eat and just talk with us.

It was Friday and I had just gotten off of work with James's dad. James's wasn't out of school yet, so I walked to his bus stop and waited for him. On the way back home, he told me some girls wanted to come over and they wanted to do beans (ecstasy) with us. We called up our regular guy, but he had nothing. One of our other friends said he could get some from a guy he knew, hesitant at first, we told him to go ahead and call. The guy came over, our friend got them, and we went to our friends room to examine them.

The ""beans"" didn't look like any bean we'd ever seen before - plus they crumbled very easily. Thinking we'd just got ripped off, I and James split the 10 and at 5 each, then we got the guys number from our friend.

We called the guy and he assured us that they were real. We still didn't believe him, and feeling broke and sober, we called Frank to see if we could make some quick money to get some alcohol or something - Frank told us he would be over shortly. The guy we got the pills from called us back and told us that the pills we took weren't beans but Mescaline, and 2 each should have us fucked up. We still didn't believe him. We were wrong.

Frank came and picked us up about 15 minutes after the phone call from the pill guy. He asked if we were hungry and we told him, yes, so he took us to Burger King. During ordering, James and I started to feel the effects. James asked if I was feeling anything, I lied and told him no. This freaked him out. We got to the table and James continued to ask if I was feeling anything, I still told him, no, and Frank asked what we were on - I told him I didn't know what he was talking about. James just sat there and looked at his Whopper® and tried to eat. I managed to eat mine. On the way out I told James the truth.

Frank took us to Home Depot for supplies for a project he wanted us to do in a few days, and he sent us to get nails. I remember we ended up in the tool department, laughing at all the tools - and that I picked up a hammer and it melted in my hand. We somehow got an employee to get us the nails, and after Frank wondered why it took us 45 minutes to get nails, he paid and we left.

By the time we got to Frank's house it was dusk. He wanted us to take care of his dogs that he had in a big kennel in his backyard. This usually meant feed them, put water in their bowls, and if there were any shit and piss, remove the shit and hose the piss. When we got in the kennel, it seemed like it was another world. Behind the kennel, it was thick woods, and the sides had a tall overgrowth, so when you first walked in, to someone on a mind altering substance, it made it seem you were in the jungle somewhere in South America.

James started feeding the dogs, and I turned on the hose to fill the water bowls. After I turned on the hose, the water coming out looked like plants and flowers - only they had a dot matrix effect. I stood there amazed when one of the dogs walked over and started drinking the plant-flower water. I'm not sure how long we were in the kennel, but when we got back, Frank asked what took us so long, and James told him we were tripping on Mescaline.

He told us a story about a time he took LSD or something, I don't remember what exactly was, or did I have the focus to pay attention as I was tripping my balls off, but after he told us he used to love to trip when he was younger, and he wanted to show us something. He took us to a secret room in his house, and inside this room was mostly painting. Dali, Escher, and a ton of other paintings and trippy ""artifacts"" that he had kept from his psychonaut days. Frank eventually left and James and I sat in the room for the rest of our trip.

2006 was a bad year for James and me. I got arrested. James's mother was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver and about a month after that Frank died.

A relapse is more than one occurance (technically). 

The whole reason I quit was to get my shit together. Ive done that now with a great home based business that I run, a car (fuckin finally) which Ive been without for 6 agonizing months, and a decent chunk of funds in savings. I think things are going great and I love this life more than I could ever love the hardcore opaite life I once lived in last year, for years. 

I found my calling and am persuing that, its gets me out of bed in the morning excited to start the day and make my own money, thats what drives me these days, much like what drove me to go panhandle and steal when I was sick. I dont miss the lifestyle at all, BUT I am open to reuniting so to speak with opiates for all that ive achieved. I know this sounds cliche, celebrating by getting high. But I cant say that I dont miss the actual high, the lifestyle, fuck that, but the high... The high im willing and wanting to visit.

Looking for adcive. Is this feasable or am I dancing with the devil? I wont say that ""I know im stronger"" because maybe Im not and Ive learned not to be so cocky these days. Just looking for input on this, have any of done this before? A one time thing, after months clean, then keep on staying clean after for just as long or longer?

This dude I pick up from... This dude. He treats women like objects, shorts his customers(occasionally including me), always begs for rides & promises he'll shoot me a little extra, almost never actually does. He's really the most unreliable person I've ever met in my life, and if you or I thought that just DOING dope will get rid of your hobbies and not give you ""time"" to do other things. Well when you bring this guy into the mix, consider your life done, because you're either gonna be with/waiting for him, or be at home doing your stuff because you were with him all day trying to cop. 
But of course, I always always always hit him up, Because his dope is the best dope in the county. 

Even though I know he's a terrible person when I'm high, when I'm sick, he's a god.

would a snorter like myself be better off with blues or moons (apparently he can get both)?

what are some fair prices to pay for these moons, or what do they go for around your area (i'm in the middle of the south if that helps, not too far down but still not up north)?

what are the best ways to use these moons? can they be successfully insufflated or is it a waste? i don't shoot and i really prefer to sniff my drugs (as opposed to swallow/plug them.) 

how much better (or are they better?) are the moons than oxy? i know they're technically stronger but having never done them i have to basis for comparison.

thanks in advance guys (and gals), been doing a lot of reading about them but there are a lot of conflicting answers to these questions out there, and i don't want to drop $75 on something that ends up being a waste, especially if i can just as easily get my dearly beloved blues. figured i should start asking the people who know best, as this community has been my go-to for opiate info for years now. thanks again homies and take care of yourselves out there!",1455209572.0

45ir4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/45ir4i/my_secret_is_out/,14,https://redd.it/45ir4i,nycub717,My Secret Is Out,"Quick backstory for those who haven't seen me around, I cleaned up from a bad dope habit 4 years ago, stayed clean until October. I have a great career, a wonderful fiancé and my life is certainly not out of control like it was during my previous addiction. 

However, I relapsed in October and have used on and off since then, mostly being a binge user, going on crazy two week binges where I'm not sober for a mere minute and then suffering w/d for 3 days or a sub taper for a week or so to reset the tolerance with minimal pain.

The shit hasn't hit the fan...yet. I thought I could only make it 6 months before it hit the fan, but frankly things are kind of quiet. Yeah, I'll do drug seeking behavior and I mean obviously I'm not happy, but on the same note, I'm not UNHAPPY. So there's that. I figure that I could probably keep using like this for a bit more than I originally anticipated.   

Anyway here comes today. I come home from work and my fiancé is outside on the terrace of our apartment. Which isn't so abnormal because we both smoke cigs but it's like beyond freezing today and we'll usually just smoke inside on days like today. I go out and she's smoking a J. And I'm like laughing and she's like, this is my dirty little secret, I smoke weed everyday after work (she gets out of work around 4pm and I come home between 8-10pm) to relax. So she knows my past addiction history and is supportive of whatever I wanna do. I just kept it a secret because who the fuck wants to marry a heroin addict? 

Anyway, she asks me when the last time I used was, she knows I started drinking in October and that I quit AA in the summer. I told her that it was earlier that day and she asked what and I was honest. She didn't seem too surprised and upset, she just was more interested. 

We had a talk a couple of hours long and she's cool with it, as long as I'm not IV'ing. Which is a fair compromise. I told her I'd stop shooting and gave her all my sharps to throw out. Relationships are about compromise I guess. We also agreed that if she felt it was getting too much I'd go back on suboxone long-term and re-enter outpatient treatment. Again, in my opinion, a fair compromise. 

All in all, it feels good to have it out there. She reacted well, she wasn't upset and didn't tell me I couldn't do it. She fucks with pills now and then so I think she gets it. Not he addiction/disease part but the want to do drugs to destress from a long day or during a long day. I'm glad she accepts my choice and I'm frankly kind of happy she's going to ""keep an eye on me"". We can all fool ourselves to the umpteenth degree that our addictions are not out of control. Leads to bad shit. Well, I have her to help me realize when it is. I just hope love is stronger than dope, but again, I put down dope 4 years ago, cold turkey, because I had enough. Not that it was easy, but I hope even though I'm obviously inflicted with the disease of addiction that my superego will come through if it ever comes to it. 

TL;DR: Addict, relapsed 4ish months ago, binge using, hiding from fiancé, I come clean and she is as supportive as one can be. ",1455338283.0

I'm starting to do press for another film that's getting a release soon (not the one where my character deals with addiction) and I'm apparently going to field some questions about my upcoming project, for which some of you gave me great insight.
So, long-winded introduction finally complete: would you like for me to mention this sub in press?  I've done plenty of other research for this film, so mentioning this sub isn't a necessity by any means.  But would you like me to mention it as a harm-reduction website, mention it by name, or not mention it at all?  Basically, do you want me to mention this community or not?
Either way is totally fine, I just want to give credit where credit is due, if that's something you're interested in.  I don't want to expose you to any unwelcome attention, but I also don't want to ignore your contributions unless you would prefer me to
Tl,dr:  would you like for this sub to be mentioned in the press or not?

ETA:  thank you all for your replies and I understand that you don't want this community to be highlighted - no problem!  Thank you so much for your help and I'll try to come back and link to info about the film (which won't be released until 2017, at the earliest) when there's more widespread press.  I'm sorry that I can't disclose more about it now, but I would probably be in trouble if I did - this was more of a personal thing for me and was not endorsed or sanctioned by any parties other than myself. 
(But I'm not, like, an A-list movie star or anything exciting so you're not really missing out on anything!)

The high when you haven't used anything in a while, and you use for the first time- it is so clear headed. I feel like it would be very hard to nod off it. This is great for talking to people, and I tend to feel the warm glow in this stage. Is this just the rush? For poppy seed tea it lasts maybe 8 hours if it's the first time I've used in a while, maybe 1-3 hours if I have been using every day.

For poppy seed tea, the other part of the high is this very sedating, noddy high that lasts over 36 hours. There isn't a ton of euphoria, but a good amount of itching, urine retenion, constipation, and dried mucus membranes. This part of the high can become unenjoyable at least for me, and makes me stop using so regularly, as it overwhelms the feel of the other type of high. I feel like there isn't too much pain killing from this stage. I have to concentrate to keep my eyes from unfocusing. Maybe something close to an NMDA antagonist high?

I feel like the body-euphoria and warm is another distinct part of the opioid high.

What are yall's thoughts on this? What are the basic elements of the opioid high? It's been a while since I've had enough pills to do them regularly, but I think I remember that second type of high when I was using them for a while. It could also be other, non mu-opioids or other alkaloids in the poppy tea. I feel like it's almost impossible to piss on this stuff, much more so compared to any other opioid.

Maybe the 2nd, shittier high comes from the receptors being saturated for a while? Maybe the 1st kind of high is the rush?

Anyway I wanted to ask you kind souls if anyone has procured any of our favorite recreational activity enablers in mexico? Let's say theoretically, by the most popular tourist destination, so I CAN go to the stores but the strongest thing the pharmacy here by resorts has is codeine and tramadol.

And I've got my last handful of oxys waiting for me. I need to take a break, my tolerance has almost doubled in the past week or so due to daily use for the past two weeks (I usually either try to or have to keep it to 1-5 times per week, depending on a few variables). Not to mention, I dipped into tomorrow's stash tonight a little to supplement this dose, since I'm so fucking down about my ex. So not only am I going to be depressed and feeling shitty mentally, I'm going to be going through mild to moderate WDs after tomorrow's batch wears off. I'm hoping they're not too bad, but I skipped my dose yesterday and it was fucking miserable. Irritable as fuck, shitting what feels like acid every 30 minutes. Hot, cold, sweating and shitting, hot, cold, continue sweating, again with the shitting, kicking around in bed, covered in sweat, no sleep, more shitting.

Got my lopes and literally a couple of Klonopin ready, and thank god I'm off work for a few days and don't have any responsibilities, but ugh. Really dreading this.

45pa8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/45pa8m/in_praise_of_nurses/,5,https://redd.it/45pa8m,jhenry64,In praise of nurses.,"tl dr: if you have vein problems go to hospital late at night and nurses are heros

Went to the ER tonight because I was getting worried about a red rash going along a vein on my arm. I live in a city with a long history of violent crime and was practically patted down coming in. Its also worth mentioning it was close to midnight. After getting past the gaurd I walk down a hallway that opens into a waiting room where a bunch of people sit looking very very bored as some nature show plays on tv.

Theres a sign giving instructions to sign in and take a seat however there is nothing to write on and no one that works at the hospita isl in sight. Ugh, I have to work tomorrow and Ill be lucky to get out at by 2am and Im gonna end up with some unpaid bill. Regardless, having read enough websites imploring those with symptoms of phlebitis to 'seem medical attention', I resign myself to waiting and worrying about my work bike outside getting stolen. 

In walks a nurse who apologizes for the lack of sign in sheets, looks around for some and can't find them so tells me she'll just come meet with me in the office instead. I have read about hospitals being dismissive towards dope users or treating us poorly so I wasnt sure how she'd react, but there wasnt really anyway to skirt around the issue so I pulled up my sleeve and explained the situation. she gave me a quick examination and 5-10 minutes of her night to hear my concerns and consider them fairly.  She told me it was my choice to see a doc but she didn't think it was a concern and i should just bandage the vein, not touch it or shoot in it and just check to make sure its not spreading up the vein or feeling worse. She gave me a bandaid and told me to watch out for it feeling hot or tender or having a weak pulse in that arm. She even joked saying, ""i shouldnt tell you this but you have a beautiful vein on the other side of your arm there, you didnt hear it from me. Ha!! I did know that but its at a weird angle

So, what's the point of this sorta boring story? Besides the importancs of rotating veins, it really got me thinking about how rad it was that lady treated me totally like a human and with respect and more generally, how nurses often (i have a few in family) go out of their way to be reassuring and caring despite the massive amount of crazy shit they deal with. 

There was a this american life last week talking about violence in hospitals and how hospital staff face as many if not more crazy people wanting to hurt than than police officers and how often they have to deal with people in te darkest depths of psychosis and distress. Except they dont have special laws protecting their lives and guns. The way this hospital was secured like a jail certainly did not dissuade me of this notion. When we consider professions worthy of praise I think they should be close to the top
and considering the shit I read on these forums Im sure quite a few of us have benefitted from their kindness..Thank a nurse today",1455436747.0

7-8 minutes later my lips were turning blue and my pulse was disappearing.  Thank god my boy /u/whippetkid71 was there and was quick to action.  He had Suboxone available (it was the only form of Naltrexone/Naloxone available) and fixed 8mgs into 2 shots.  He was unable to find a vein while I was performing an incredibly impressive ""VIOLETTE YOURE TURNING VIOLET"" impression.  So the first sub shot was administered IM and had little effect.  It took the second shot of 4mgs of sub to stop my rapid color change and to restart my non-existent pulse. 

Coming too in that situation is crazy because you have no idea what happened and the people all around you look like they saw a ghost.  ""What's the deal guys? Why do you guys look like someone died?""  The last thing I remember thinking is ""this rush is surprisingly good"" AND THEN LIGHTS OUT WENT OUT. CUE FADE TO BLACK.

I am a busy person, I told myself. I have three kids, I told myself. Where would I possibly have the time to do this? Well one person than another than another would send me messages like the one I got this morning:
""Well, I just picked up from being sick all day so I was very ready to get in a shot. And I didn't usually do this dope so I should've done a test shot. And I did a bit more than I normally do and it was a lot stronger than I thought. I remember the rush and then woke up 20 minutes later with my buddy freaking out saying how lucky I was to have that naloxone with me or I would've died. I had stopped breathing. I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for what you do for the people on this site and for all the lives you save on a daily basis""

So weeks went by. Then a few months. Now I am counting the years. I have collected over $3000 in donations from sub members, lurkers, and fund raisers over the years. That money has sent out over 1,000 care packages. I added a partner this year /u/nickwhcp. Various people started sending out packages as well. One person started a program in the Dallas area. We have accomplished some great things. 

When people say users don't care, remember all the things we have accomplished. I will always be a day late to the post office. I will always be short supplies, money, or energy. That is how harm reduction rolls. No one wants to fund us. That being said, we still have saved 160 lives. These are YOUR friends. These are YOUR family. This is us. This is something we all did together.

I know it's not an opiate, but it possibly could be. 

My dude got these the other day and snorted 3 of them and ended up FREAKING the fuck out like he ate a bunch of acid without knowing or some other psychedelic chemical. He has no clue what they actually are but ended up tripping and freaking out and getting kinda violent.  

I thought it might be pcp and from what I've heard from his girlfriend, he was acting kinda like it was but we have no clue. Anyone ever encounter fake xanax bars that make you trip? I figured they would have most likely been laced with fent or another opiate but from what I've been told, it most likely was not. 

He gave me a couple and I'm considering trying it out. Crazy mofo did 3 of the bitchss over the course of an hour. Idk what he was thinking but he's not the brightest dope boy in the game.

I had been working on this old Malibu for my buddy as like a side job for the nights and weekends and he calls me one evening while I'm working on his car to say he finally got strait come over I want to pay you. So i'm super excited haven't been able to get anything all day I'm broke and i though all hope was lost i was just about to take a piece of sub when he calls. Lets just say speed limits where not whats on my mind as i head over there. I am driving like an asshole you know passing cars just to beet them to the red light so i can race off first stops sign have no meaning to me at this point. However i make it there fine and in damn good time i gotta say. Dude gives me five m 30s and like fifteen methadone 10s. I snort two blues right there and just throw the rest in my pocket. Dude says Im sorry i haven't been able to pay you in a couple weeks, supposed to pay weekly, so hear is two hundred bucks man. i'm all smiles i hug the dude i thought there was no way im making it till Friday i'm gonna wd this week but nope i'm saved. So i jump in my car and start driving carefully back to my shop. But shit now i've got this money so i call the my man with Ds as i'm snorting another 30. I meet my dude all is well, i decide i need to stop for a fresh pack of smokes and redbull so i can catch up on work tonight. After driving like a mad man all across town and nothing happening what could be the harm in one little extra stop? Well this gas station is less than a mile from my shop maybe a half mile if that. The street my shop is on ends at four lane highway that has a turning lane in the middle and the gas station is directly across the four lanes highway but because of where the driveway of the gas station is you cant go strait across its maybe a fifteen degree angle across the four lanes to my street. so im sitting there about to cross the four lanes onto my street. I have the methadone's and blues in my jeans pocket and the ds in my shirt pocket. I light a cigarette and pull out across the highway and onto my street. Just as i'm thinking about how great its gonna be to shoot a D when i get back the blue lights fill my mirrors.

Sorry i ran out of time. The rest is as follows.

Panic! That's what filled my soul as those god damn lights came crashing into what was a great moment. What do i do? the shop is so close i can literally see the sign. Do i just eat all these things that would suck, and why am i being pulled over anyways? this car is legal i'm not driving bad fuck i just left a parking lot. I decide i'm not eating all these things fuck that. the D's where in my shirt pocket so i take them out and stick them in the center a/c vent and hope they don't fall all the way down. I cant get the shit out of my pocket with out moving in the seat so much they will no something is up so put on my blinker and make the cop follow me to my shop. I pull in turn off the motor and wait for him to come to the window. The guy walks up and i say what seems to be the problem GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE CAR as he snatches my cigarette out of my mouth, never got to say the word officer. At that moment i think I'm fucked i got felonys in my pocket. He pulls me out pushes me over the hood I try and ask why i was pulled over but he tells me to shut up and goes right into my pockets. I new i was fucked. he does back pockets first, then right from, then the one with three blues and fifteen dones his hand goes in fishes around comes back out and he stands me up and says why the fuck didn't you stop? I said i did stop did i not pull over fast enough i was simply looking for a safe place for both of us to pull over and this is my business so it seemed like a good place to go. Then his backup arrives. Can we search the car? Sure, everything is in my pocket i think so i don't argue, but why did i get pulled over officer? Mr backup says ""we'll get to that after we search the car"". The first cop tells mr backup to put me in the back off his car while they search and mr back up asks me if I've been searched so i say oh yes sir he searched me and backup say well i'm gonna search you again reall quick and my heart drops so here we go back pockets, right front pocket, left front pocket all i can here is the sound of my heart pounding out of my chest his hand come out and he says ""okay have a seat in the car i'm not gonna cuff you but if there are any drugs in the car just tell us now its better if you cooperate"". I say no sir there is nothing in the car as he closes the door on me. I cant believe it two cops where in my pocket and neither on felt pills that are just loose in my pocket! I can't believe it now i'm sitting there debating whether or not to eat them all while they are searching but i don't i just sit there and stare at them rifle through my car in disbelief. I want to eat them but i'm too scared to make a move and my heart is pounding that they are gonna see the ds in the a/c vents. Ten minutes go by and the come back and say sir step out of the vehicle. The reason i pulled you over is you cant come out of the gas station and cross the highway sideways to this street you have to go up and turn into the next street. This sounds like bullshit but i apologize and say sorry sir a didn't know it won happen again. He says okay and next time a officer turns there lights on you pull right over it just makes us think you have something to hide i was sure i was gonna find drugs in your vehicle.
And just like that they leave. I unlock the shop and get my flash light, the D's are right there in the vent got em out with tweasers. Went in side and shot away my troubles. Thank god for lose change and mcdonalds receipts! ",1455387862.0

I want to cut down my usage of poppy tea. I'm using most days at the moment and I've seen my tolerance increase for the first time in 3+ years of dabbling/using opiates, which is a bit worrying.

My idea is cumulative breaks. I've used today, so tomorrow I won't use. The day after that I will. Then, I won't use for two days, then have one day on, 3 days off, one day on, 4 days off, until I can come off of it without, or with minor, withdrawals.

Has anyone had any success with this method? I still want to get high, which likely says something about my success chances, but this seems like it'll lessen the blow in regards to withdrawal? I'm going to start a new psych medication for my depression, which is the reason I use anyway, just don't want to have to deal with shitty withdrawals for the first week or two of being on meds. I won't be able to tell which side effects are meds and which are withdrawals, and I imagine it'll just be a shitty time overall. Hopefully the meds will kick in in a few weeks and help my really low moods, which will pretty tackle my reason for using poppy tea in the first place.

I found for me I could pass all my drug tests still and it helped so much with depression. I've tried k since then and MXE was way more effective than k ever was but k still helped with cravings in the moment. Like if I really want to cop a bag and instead do k I find myself satisfied. On MXE there was just more of an afterglow vs k I wake up and sometimes felt more depressed. I've tried 3 MEo pcp. And I found it to not really help to much. It's an okay drug. But seems very much more functional. Hard to explain but it seems to not effect my head space as much and just have more of a body load. Which I don't enjoy too much but overall better than nothing. I'm getting in (hopefully soon) some new ket I think people have been calling it. Real name descloketamine I believe. Anyone try out this drug or any others to help hell im even open to hearing about dxm or PCp if it will help me. Or I'll just listen out of couroisity to hear what they are like. 

I know this has actually nothing to do with oppiates and only to do with nmda antagonist. But these are very good drugs for kicking opiates and very helpful with the paws and depression that follow kicking. I've used MXE many a times to get myself into subs painlessly. As in I avoided the 24 hour withdrawl period and slight uncomfortable feels of subs as you transition. And I know that if I went 5 days straight on MXE I could of ""cold turkey"" off dope. As it totally takes away the withdrawl. Ketamine works for this too but it's too hard to maintance for 5 days as tolerance increases too fast. ",1455539569.0

After a long day and night of a great birthday celebration. I posted that weird Facebook status thanking people for the birthday wishes, most of these people I barley know, because my close friends and family call me, old fashion but at least it feels real. now I have to give a mass thank you to old acquaintances, even though they their just doing their daily social media ritual. I appreciate everything but I'm really starting to get fed up with Facebook in general its becoming sad.  

Anyway thank you to you guys ( /r/opiates) this sub means alot to me. I've been a subscriber for 2 years. when I have a question or want to discuss quality dope porn pics, or vent about my awful day. comments on here would be dark and disturbing anywhere else on the social network sites but here its comedy gold. 

In the 2 years here I went through the craziest shit in my life. I was a scumbag when I first came here. Now im much less scumbag because I don't have to be anymore. I don't shoot dope every day anymore but Im no saint, I'm on as a write this. Last year I was turning 21 while living halfway house, it was the worst b-day ever, and traditionally 21st birthday is huge deal . I took my halfway house time seriously to finally get myself off of probation after many years of fucking it up. I actually did my duty, and still active on r/opiates. I saw a lot of posts about kratom a non opiate herb with similar affects. my second week there I walked around Lancaster, (where I was) and got some at a head shop. I felt like I just coped DAT new fire Pablo just got in lol. I was clean for 2 months and I for me if I'm clean that long my tolerance will go way down. So I walked back to the halfway house, and b-lined to my room and swallowed a couple grams of the herb powder then washed it down. Hour goes by and I felt nothing, I was disappointed but new it wasn't gonna be great considering I am an IV user, but a half hour later I had a nice opiate buzz and that night I was thrilled to go to aa and I raised my hand to share and it was just a crazy rant, enough that my house manager thought I was high I got drug tested that night, I gave him my piss with a shit eating grin. unfortunately that high got me craving dope real bad because I'll it did was tease me. Well I managed to stay clean for the next 2 months but I eventually used luckily that time I was good.

when I was at some really low points in life this place gave me hope believe or not. Instead of my depression taking over my mind until I cave and pick up where I left off. This place let me vent  my depression. Some people even related to my posts where I'd just vent out my feelings. I mean if I post here asking for advice or help for whatever shit situation I was in. I would get great comments that helped me. A lot more than the addiction councillors or AA people gave me, I know that works for a lot of people but for a lot of opiate addicts those support groups can make u feel hopeless and they put their ""way"" of sobriety on a pedestal making it seem its the only way to live after addiction. They follow religion based Dogma's almost like they plagiarised Christianity

Theres a lot of users here that are not only great people but are intelligent, creative, and extremely funny. I love all the topics on here from harm reductions, tips on making it through another day when your options seem to be getting close to a casket or a cell. I even think dope porn posts and gifs and memes are great but they have to be creative pics, I don't mean to boast my I always put at least 5 mins to take that perfect dporn pic. And there's been great gifs and memes that are so funny but only to some in this opiate life style. 

Well I wanted to say thanks to everyone contributing on here junkies need people to talk to that have similar personalities, and older users who can drop knowledge on guys like me. We are more realistic than AA or NA ideologies that u must be on there game plan or relapse is only a matter of time. Every meeting you see that judging look everyone has on there face like cult followers. Instead of the idea your completely powerless in life, and must turn your life over to a higher power. I decided to take my life back in my hands and learn from the past. I now know when I go to a rehab facility I feel great when I complete but I still end up coping when ever I get home. I did this because I didn't like feeling emotions and past decisions I'm not proud of, so I still love to get high. This year I made changes with help from posting my ideas to make sure they were logical. I ended up saving a little cash and getting a suboxone prescription and I struggled transitioning to it but after a month I just got it and its an amazing drug for junkie's in my opinion. Some people say you just switch addictions but on dope I couldn't maintain a good job and was always in legal problems, car accidents, in life or death situations on the reg, and I was a scumbag. Suboxone makes the addiction as easy as taking a vitamin.

And FYI before I typed this I did a 5 bagger and mixed in a little crystal powder from Angel wings. WOW what a cool Rush but the speed high eventually takes over, as anyone that reads this probably noticed.

I swam the white sea and marveled in the green pool. Endless emerald. I approached the precipice. 

I crept to the edge of the pit. Before me plummeted a well, seemingly limitless. Deepening dark swallowed the green pool in a silent circular waterfall. Beyond the emerald splash it was a perfect void. Sightless. Soundless. Thoughtless. Loveless. 

Determined in my task I attached my rope to a lash to aide my descent into the smothering nothingness. I must rappel. My back to the pupil, my right foot was the first to leave my small planet (a binary system, in this case) followed by my left, which was always getting mixed up in Rightie's schemes. Now my feet were over the edge, and I horizontal. My body hung by the tension of mere threads. I looked up one more time into the outside world. I sent silent love letters to the emerald pool, the white sea, the lash forest. Windows to the soul, they say. I let go.

The emerald waters swallowed me after a lifetime of falling, and then I sank. The once vibrant waters were pitch black in the gather gloom. The deepening dark took me into its core, slowly crushing, severing soul from body. 

It was in those final moments that I truly knew myself, as my own gravity hung me like a common thief. I was, in fact, a special thief. I had sought to steal myself, and hung nonetheless.",1455525268.0

This was Tuesday night.  I have recently relocted to an old stomping ground of mine which I opted to stay away from for so many years because I knew it would get to this point, not wanting to be here and getting as fucked up as possible.  Everything is falling into place and should be getting better but I just keep fucking myself over.  So, I reconnected with this awesome chick that Ive only met a few times before but always had a really strong connection with even in the brief times I had met her.  She came over to my house Wednesday night and has been taking care of me in my opana withdrawal stages.  I have popped 100 tab 10s in the past 4 days, as well as snorting 29 blues.  still haven't gotten high until today.  anyway, obviously she saw me at my WORST, puddles of sweat, moaning like a little bitch, etc etc etc.  she stayed through it all and she is still here now, putting on some sexy little lingere on for me for valentines day shenanigans.  We have had sooooooo much sex since she has been here, but we have also laid in bed in eachothers arms just talking about things that I would and have never told other people.  She really likes me for me, not for what I have, which is a rarity in my life.  I'm a fat loser junkie with a crazy ass baby mama and a hefty opiate addiction.  what perfect 10 inside and out chick wants that?????  she doesn't do opiates but she does party, we have been doing blow and smoking and dabbing like nobodys business.  But she is hesitant to even take a dab of my wax without asking, same for weeed and the yayo.  she definitely isn't using me and I can tell that 100%.  she is falling for me just as hard.  for those of you that know me, you know I just got out of an 8 year relationship with a crazy cunt and some fucked up shit went down and ive been really depressed for the first time in my life.  well for the first time since 9 months ago when that happened, I'm actually happy.  I feel that connection that only a s/o can make you feel.  we have made an agreement to remain exclusive for now and not put a label onto it and take it where it goes.  the thing that's fucking with me is that she is a stripper and ve never dated a stripped or stripped type.  I am 26, she is 20.   so of course its amazing for a fatass like myself to be having a literal perfect 10 in my bed and fucking me 15 or so times since Wednesday night...I NEEEEEDED that.  but my heart is telling me there is sooooooooo much more there than the sex, and from the way she has been acting and takng care of me I can tell that she feels the same way.  she was supposed to go to work on Thursday and every night since, but she hasn't and hasn't even left my house without me.  we are being so honest with eachother that I feel it cant go anywhere in the direction of hurting me, but maybe I'm naïve in that I haven't had this so long that I'm really craving it and just loving havig her around..... advice ?  thoughts?  etc???

Update: I did visit him and holy shit, he looked awful. It completely turned me off from opiates all together. I've been replaying the visit over and over in me head and it's freaking me out, but some better news is that he gave me a thumbs up and the nurse says that's the most purposeful thing he did since he was there!

I went ahead with my usual dosage and snorted the 40mg opana and mixed it with 2-3mg of xanax. 

Next thing I know I'm waking up on the bathroom floor and can't feel my feet. I crawled to bed hoping that after a couple hours of sleep I would be right as rain. How wrong I was. 

When I woke up I couldn't stand or walk. I still had absolutely no feeling in my feet. I called my mom and told her something was wrong so she came over. After seeing what was wrong she decided to take me to the ER. Note: At this point my feet were still so numb you could have poked them with a knife and I wouldn't have known. 

The doctor ran some tests and had me x-rayed and MRI'ed to determine if I had cracked or broken my tailbone or vertebrae but my bones were fine. Then my blood test came back and he asked me if I had partied the night before and slept on the ground. Turns out I had slipped and fell onto my tailbone and then passed out in an awkward position on the bathroom floor. The position I had passed out in just so happened to cut off circulation in my feet for the several hours I was out. 

The doc said that my CK levels were over 25000, when they aren't meant to be over 300. I had something called rhabdomyolysis, which is where the weakened muscles from where I fell released a bunch of myoglobin and enzymes which flooded my kidneys nearly causing them to shut down. 

It was at this time that I was admitted to the hospital where they could start pumping me full of fluids for the next 3 days in the hopes of saving my kidneys. When I asked the doctor about whether or not I would gain control of my feet again he said it was a guessing game, but that wasn't his priority. That really pissed me off because it sure as hell was my priority.

Anyway, I'm incredibly lucky to have regained full use of my feet and kidneys and won't be passing out anywhere but my bed anytime soon. ",1455472044.0

By mid Jan everything came crashing down I no longer had the influx of pills that I once had so I decided to start to get clean.

I used ondansetron, klonopin, pseudoephedrine and imodium to help with the WD, it wasn't easy but I made it to almost 10 days clean, I could not resist to re-up, so I did.

I won't lie, since I hadn't had anything really my tolerance was lower so it was great in that department, I thought I could get clean again since I already had done it, this had proven harder than before, so much that yesterday I just could not handle it mentally. So I ended up going to the ER to get some morphine and about 15 hydros.

I sit here with just a few hydros left, but no kpins since my doc switched me to diazepam, but it is not working as good as the kpins, not sure what to do here, not sure if I can even pull through again.

I'm sorry if I am just ranting but looking for a bit of assistance in how to get clean, I know my mistake was to keep contact with my dealer, but I am dreading the WDs again and above all dealing with the reality of life.
