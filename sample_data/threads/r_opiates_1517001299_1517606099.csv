Basically he has been clean from opiates for 3 months after a pretty much straight year of using. He decided to use tonight and was super high and feeling great for a few hours then he started throwing up violently and has a migraine like headache. Its been going on the last four or five hours. He cant keeo anything down and is just moaning in agony.
This has happened to me as well after picking up black tar heroin after being sober off opiates for some time. 
Is this common?? Seems to only be with tar though. It happened to me in LA multiple times over a two year span and now its happening to my buddy in Portland so i think it must have something to do with tar in general  

If this has happened to you, whats best to help? Im usually sick for an entire day after and then feel perfectly fine. Im hoping he is not sick that long, however. Using more does not seem to help so i havent let him use since his initial dose which wasnt even much.

I plan on going to buy some weed in the am because thats the only thing i can think of that wont do more harm than good. I have a lot of gatorade but he cant keep it down and dehydration just makes the symptoms way worse.

Sorry for the long post, just trying to help my friend. And am also curious as to why this happens...seems so strange to me.",1517053052.0
7tc0j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7tc0j1/that_was_strange_i_guess/,22,https://redd.it/7tc0j1,sloan_fitch,That was.... strange.. I guess.,"First I gambled on Friday night. I saw Cliff's sister walking her dog so I gave her money for six subs at standard face value. Then later on, an hour later she called me to verify the order and then called again thirty minutes later to tell me she got it. Wow, that was quick.


Cliff owed me so he gave me some of his script. This time the roxy 15s were not green but white. Never saw white oval shaped roxies before. They still work the same though form what I can tell. Maybe I should try that new loop straw that someone psted the other day. Never had trouble with my lungs before from snorting and I'm hoping to stop soon but never hurts to reduce harm in them mean time I suppose.

&nbsp;

So anyway, before work today I visit Cliff's to get the pills he owes me and to check on his sister to see if she was home to give me my subs.

Her friend, Danika was there just coming in with the dog. She mentioned to me that she just picked up 90 subs form her doctor and that she's trying to sell. When she realized her friend Cliff's sister got me subs from someone else she was upset because ""she knew I (Danika) needed the money.""

Danka then sprang into talking mad shit. ""I paid $300 to fix up the walls in that room then she let DJ move in for $125 per week."" You see, a couple of months ago she was in that room with some big African American dude (Danika's a white chick with thinning hair) and she gave me $10 that she knew I could spend on something I could find a connect. The $10 was given to me so that I'd fix a ripped power cord. So I rigged it and earned those ten bux.

In between getting tools from other rooms for the job, the door kept getting locked and I ahd to wait outside the door. She was either blowing this guy, or doing coke, H, PCP, or something else. Like I said, despite those delays I was successful.

A day later she was kicked out for prostituting herself in Cliff's house which Cliff's sister didn't appreciate. 

&nbsp;

Back to today she's in the house and Danika is saying ""Cliff's sister was jealous of me because I had an older man hanging around taking care of me... she texted and said I was mad ugly..."" 

She then went on to mention the time (the one time out of eight) where Cliff's sister had $60 of mine for subs that got stolen because the sub connect ran with the money and didnt' come back the following day because of ""snow"". Danika speculated that maybe it was true but felt more strongly about the possibility that money was owed to that connect and this was how the connect got it back from her.

&nbsp;

Well anyway, despite me being re-stocked in fresh subs, Danika insisted on giving me a free sub. ""Do you want a pill or a strip?"" She woudln't take no for an answer so I took the strip.

She then said that if I ever needed any I can get a credit up to three days in advanced and that she'd sell me 15 of them at a good discount. Furthermore I wouldn't have to pre-pay her for them so transactions would happen in real time.

Danika further speculated that Cliff's sis was making money by getting me my subs. I don't know if that's true unless the sub connect was charging her less than normal street price which I'm fine with as long as the profit motivates her to get the subs quickly and without fail.

&nbsp;


Not sure why Danika insisted on giving me a free sub.

&nbsp;

Later on while I was away, Danika got into a fight with some guy outside. Was making mad noise. Cliff said he stayed inside and wouldn't get involved. Then Danika came knocking on his door and was like bugging and black and blue. Complained that nobody would come out and help... She was also asking for me but who knows why. Tech help?

&nbsp;

Hours later Danika had pain in her stomach and an ambulance came to pick her up. Cliff's sister needed to use my phone when I came up stairs to check who got in the ambulance and to make sure it wasn't Cliff's sister. So after making some phone calls and trying to get some update info on the situation she asked to borrow my bicycle. My $700+ bike. She wanted to go somewhere two miles away to knock on Danika's man's door to do something or get some update.. IDK. 

I said I needed to check something, reminded her that she cold contact my phone if she needed me and got the fuck out. 

The idea of loaning my bike out is a risk I'd prefer to avoid taking. If that shit disappeared she wouldn't be able to replace it and I'd have a terrible day, week, month....... It was once speculated that I'd kill myself if that happened. Probably not, but I'd feel awfully shitty. 

Hope Danika feels better, and glad I got what I paid for today since it is a critical part of my plan. To have more than enough subs to get me to my next pay cycle. By which point I will either have insurance and a photo ID or a photo ID and money from my next pay check to see a sub doc. Then I can be sub human :p",1517049261.0

I have no idea where else to go for advice. I'm just trying to not be in pain and also not come across as drug seeking. For years this has just been a joke in my family about how pain killers do not work on me, but now that I'm getting older - and the pain is becoming much more common - I just need some advice.

I need to know how to explain to doctors that I'm in pain, I'm not drug seeking, and the normal first-line level of opiate-based pain management is flat out useless on me.

I have never used any opiate for fun. I'm certainly not one to look down on anyone for chosing to do so. Just saying I don't have that opiate use as a background to explain the tolerance. 

---

Even after having my wisdom teeth removed, and the oral surgeon had to keep increasing my dosage to the point he was afraid I'd have respiratory problems, my surgeon was utterly stunned that I wasn't outright anesthetized much less able to feel pain. I'm not even remotely sure how to address this. The surgeon asked me to come in and chat, asked if I'd taken the medication - and upon saying yes - was just stunned.

That was my only time ever being anesthetized and I'd managed to count back from 100 down to 80 before the anesthesiologist said ""well I guess he was right,"" adjusted some things, and I was out when I got to 65.

I'm seriously not even trying to get high or to even feel good. I'm just trying to be able to go to work without having screaming pain. But since apparently this is rare, and of course the ""opioid epidemic"" makes doctors wary to prescribe.

I have a history of all kinds of painful infections (all non-drug related) that required pain management just to get through my day. I used to be able to just call my primary care doctor, even after hours, and explain what's going on - and they'd call in a script for the standard antibiotic we needed to manage the infection plus 10mg hydrocodone w/o APAP because for me that's basically like taking acetaminophen. Of course that's not doable ever since hydrocodone was made schedule 2, but frankly hydrocodone doesn't even seem to do much of anything to me anymore.

That's not hyperbole, either. 10mg of hydrocodone for me seems to be the same kind of analgesia an average person gets from 500mg of acetaminophen.

A doctor telling me to take an NSAID or acetaminophen to help pain is pointless for me unless there's swelling the NSAID will actually deal with, and in those cases the NSAID's effect is paltry compared to an actual steroid. E.g. if I twist my ankle and it swells up I need a steroid shot, not oral steroids, to bring that swelling down. Dropping my pants and getting a huge steroid shot in my butt is something I've literally asked for more than once because I know it's the only thing that will work to bring my sprained joint back to normal.

Which gets to the crux of my problem.

The last time I saw my doctor for managing this chronic condition they'd perform a small amount of surgery on my skin and even with 4+ vials (I am not exaggerating) of lidocaine it would be all I could do to bare it. I'd grit my teeth and try my damnedest to deal with it - I honestly through about asking for a bite guard because my teeth were hurting from biting so hard - and trying to hold back from crying. For days afterward any wrong move would leave me yelping in pain and crying. My wife would come back, let me lean on her, and give me time to get my breath back because the pain was so sharp I couldn't even breathe. This usually lasts 3-4 days after the procedure.

And if you're wondering - yes the procedure is necessary. I've been dealing with this for almost a year now and I'm just so goddamned tired of being in pain and crying from it.

Maybe I'm a wuss, but holy fuck I have no idea how to handle this.

Because everything I've read, everything I'm told, is that basically the pain shouldn't be this bad. The doctor isn't doing anything wrong - I've researched the hell out of the treatments and watched the doctor perform it: everything the doctor & nurses do is 100% textbook. I've even consulted with other doctors about the proper treatment protocol to make sure everything is being done correctly.

My current doctor has written me a script for tramadol, I've taken a large amount (200mg), and had zero effect on me. I can only assume I lack the liver enzyme that turns tramadol into desmetramadol. Since tramadol has effectively no affinity for opioid receptors tramadol does nothing to help pain for me.

I have another treatment coming up in a couple weeks and I'm completely afraid of it because I can't deal with it again. I'm completely terrified and want to cancel the appointment, but for my own well being that's not an option. Last time I was in there for the procedure I broke an arm rest on the side of the exam table from gripping and pulling on it so hard trying my best to not move - I literally sheared a piece of steel in half from gripping and pulling on it so hard - and I assure you I'm no body builder.

----

**How do I convince my doctor that my pain is sincere, that the normal treatments aren't working, and do all of this without coming across as drug-seeking?**

I am utterly 100% terrified of a doctor writing ""drug seeking"" on my medical record.

My life was the way it always was as a junkie.  You know what I'm talking about.  I walked like 10 miles a day minimum, because this place had no public transit, not even a taxi cab service.  A lot of hippies lived there so thumbing a ride wasn't out of the question, but I was a junkie, so I walked everywhere.  And everywhere was way, way, way spread out, like super far away from everything else.  It was a desert town so there was no shortage of space when they planned housing.  
Anyway, at this same time, I was known at one of the local coffee shops as a junkie by the hippies who frequented it and owned it.  They didn't necessarily hate me for being a junkie per se but they did hate me for this one time they caught me stealing an organic fruit rollup and shooting up in their bathroom.  The owner literally used to chase me to the bathroom and bang on the door screaming that, ""IT BETTER SMELL LIKE SH*T WHEN I GET IN THERE!!!!!""  
I still hung out in their courtyard anyway and one night, after a day of walking and walking and walking and getting a few good shots of black out of it, I was starving and dying for a warm place to sleep.  These hippies who had known me somewhat before I relapsed and definitely knew me now took me home.  It was a woman's house.  She was fat but very pretty and probably 27 or so with 4 kids.  She made money as a seamstress or whatever she did and wore cockroach killer cowboy boots and a straw cowboy hat.  At her house, which was the way things were for most hippied out single mothers in the town, there lived four or five other grown men and women full time.  Outside of that there was an influx of anywhere between 10 and 2 people.  This night I can't remember how many there were, maybe 12 of us besides her and her kids, but I had never been there before.  I only knew like one guy's name and another girls name, but there I was all nodded out and hungry and getting stared at hard between these hippies all beating on their drums and passing joints, which I sucked down every chance I got.  They would laugh at me for taking such big hits like, ""This dude is definitely a mooch.  He's just trying to smoke the whole joint every time he gets a hit.""  They were right.  I was selfish.
So anyway, the single mother in her cowboy boots and cowboy hat has baked like two whole oven racks of chicken breast.  It's beautiful, golden brown, salted and greasy.  
I'm not sure exactly what they were waiting for.  They didn't say grace.  They weren't Christians.  Maybe they were waiting for the rest of it to be done, like some other part of the dinner, baked potatoes I don't know, but they were all just waiting politely to start eating the chicken.  
Well I wake up out of this hard nod and walk right over to the pans with all this chicken waiting to be feasted on and I grab some a breast with my bare hand and start mowing down right there.  Grease was running down my chin.  I'm sure I was making a ton of noise.  I ate several more pieces before anyone else even stood up to get one.  They were all looking at me like, ""What the F, dude?  Who are you and why did you eat our chicken like that you selfish piece of crap?""  
I'm hungry is what I would have said. Or maybe I'm the perpetually nodding chicken man?  I do'n tknow what I would have said, but I just walked to the back and found a mattress and crashed out until the morning.  When I woke up I walked back to town with one of the only two people I knew there, my pregnant friend Wendy.     ",1517036842.0

Finally got a lead, a buddy of mine has a hookup who is willing to meet us in a gas station parking lot, only catch is I have to throw my pal a line, no biggie.. WELL as it turns out this fuck had no plans of actually showing up WHATSOEVER.. we waited for 40 minutes, and his phone randomly shuts off. Fml.
Gonna drink myself into oblivion tonight.

I've gotten high in Europe so I've dealt with #3. But I've recently ended up in a major city in the South (hope that's vague enough) and I'm not sure if what I've been copping is actually H or not. In fact I'm pretty sure it's fent or an analogue. I've done real ECP before but it's been years and it was only once or twice. I just recently relapsed so I'm copping off the street in the ghetto. I'm still on a little bit of suboxone (less than a mg a day) and just occasionally doing dope often times along with crack so it's hard for me to tell the duration of the high. What I'm getting is white powder tends to be quite white maybe just a little off white. It's definitely an opiod but I don't get that heroin smell that I'm used to with tar or #3. In fact it doesn't really smell like anything even when I'm cooking it up. I haven't smoked any and I'm not doing big enough shots to really get a taste in my mouth. Is it possible this is real H? Has anyone had ECP that they knew was real but that didn't really smell and was white? I also haven't seen any fent warnings for where I am but if what I have is fent then that's all I've encountered is fent or an analogue being sold as H. ",1517025963.0

After I clean my cooker (I rarely have any residue left since I'm either getting that flame or they're good with water soluble cuts) anyways I get that one as wet as possible. Then I throw a new one in and get as much up as possible. If I'm doing it right, I should be able to press on it with a plunger and still squeeze juice out. Anyways I keep doing that until it doesn't look like I'm getting anything up. Usually takes a few of them.

I found this to be the most efficient way of making use of every last drop. It's better than just leaving one completely soaked in my experience. I'd rather have to wash or 4 or 5 and get all my left overs than just 1 and get 75%. Hope this helps someone.  Carry on",1516993697.0

Don't be me, I made it seven months without and things were going fine. I relapsed earlier this week and it was not even fun. When I got sober in summer, I would bang a gram a day to keep from being sick. This time around, I had money to spend and sprung for like half a gram which I smoked over the course of two days. Not even a real reason, I had braved far worse times without relapsing. It was just a perfect storm of boredom, financial resources, and opportunity.

I smoked a point to the face and then felt real nice for a few minutes before getting violently ill. I spent the next hours nodding off, whining in tongues and puking. I'm just glad I didn't shoot up, I could have very well been dead now.

Back to square one. At the very least I only spent like 50 bucks and didn't use enough to get physically hooked again.

For 2 years i’ve been using a product that is kowingly an unknown Fent analogue suspected to be **Furayl-Fentanyl** mixed with heroin.

When i began i would get dope sick 10 hours after being dry.  Intense symptoms.

I then introduced **subutex** to my life *pretending* to get clean but really would just use it as a safety net.
I would run out of gear and dose 2mg for the 4 day waiting for fix. 

**Then something happened...**

I stopped subutex without any problems first of all... when subutex was out of my system and life, i continue using the heroin product...

 **Now, and since then,  i’ve been using and running out continually without any sign of withdrawals.. **zero. 
NONE!**

When i finish my bag, i can go 4 days in complete health, health like someone not on drugs, full sleep, energy, no symptoms, until i score again.

Does anyone know what this is? Could it be an unknown fent analogue that somehow ligers in the body so long that it prevents sickness?

I’m trying to figure out what exactly happened so if anyone can conclude something from this, that would be awesome.

Well if you go check my post from yesterday you can see that I was having trouble finding rigs, but needless to say, I was able to purchase some this morning.

Okay so I’ve been using once a week usually, maybe once every two weeks(just wanted to give an idea of where my tolerance is), and I snorted like a point last night. I must say, before ever doing the dope, I was feeling a bit off...maybe just a little cold or something. And I wasn’t able to fall asleep. 

Fast forward to this morning and I get my rigs. I IVd maybe 40mg, which is a normal amount that I’m used to. Also I hadn’t eaten this morning (maybe that’s important to the story). It’s starting to kick in and about and I notice  feeling weird psychologically. Like something just didn’t feel quite right, and I think I was kinda scared so I remember just trying to walk around to stay moving. 

All I remember from there is waking up on the floor next to my bed with a bloody gash next to my eye. I must’ve fell down and hit my head on the bed frame. I kinda felt slow, like just stupider lol.

There’s so many factors to this that I’m having trouble figuring out whether I ODd or just passed out from lack of sleep. Either way, I got a gash next to my eye and knot on the back of my head.

Pretty scared to think the possibility of an OD, never had that happen before. I’m kinda shook up from this

Edit: So conclusion is it was an OD. And I have thought many many times what it would be like to OD and it was not like it at all. I expected an overdose to make you feel really heavy and weighed down as if gravity were twice as much. I can’t really describe it to a T, but it was more like a weird type of anxiety followed by blacking out.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the advice and experience. Now I realize just how serious this was and I could have very easily died today. This will be a good motivator to give up opiates.",1516988733.0

I dont shoot but I think about buying some syringes today that I can nod again. My tolerance didnt changed. Still high like shit. Is it possible to just shoot one time a month or so? I am very disziplinated. If I want something then I can do it everytime. I got a while back about a g of crack for free from my man and I just smoked the crack immediatly but after I smoked everything I stood the cravings to get more. It was a fantastic euphoria. And now I decided that I will get about 1-3 g of crack a month and smoke it and then its ok for me. I also want to try meth too. And I want to speedball too. So I drifted away with my thoughts my question was do you think its possible that I just shoot once a while and on the other days I will just snort my dope and be happy. Idk if its the same like crack or if I got such extreme cravings. Probably a shit post. Stay safe fam and happy nods. Oh and my clean time were 6 days this time.

This is my first post so if I break the rules or something please let me know, it wasn't my intention.

First of all, I need help. I need to know whether if I can use an excuse that would be valid in order to get my ass safe instead of getting it fucked...

So today I shot up a few lines of heroin, after being clean months and months I relapsed again. The thing is: my parents are aware of my addiction, so they are making me random drug tests over the time so I can't know exactly which day I will be tested for, so I need help.

Its obviously that if they test me right now I'd be screwed, this is why I'm actually thinking about what can I say in order to, if they catch me, at least have something else to say rather than admitting I indeed did heroín, which would make me have to go to rehab...and that cant happen since I'm going to university. 

So... If my information is correct, these drug lab tests don't actually look for the heroin itself, but its metabolites (6-am), that they are on the body for at least 24 hours until they turn into morphine, right? This is the same process that goes for codeine when you take it, it turns into morphine as well. So if I tell them that I did codeine but not heroin, would the lab still be able to test my pee to know that the metabolites in there are from heroin consumption? 

I mean, do the laboratory drug test can check whether if I consumed heroín or a different opiod? I know this can happen if the test is done within the first 24hours after consumption, but what about after that? Is it possible to know?

So I decided to give my sinuses and lungs a break and with banging out of the question, I would only have orally as an option unless I considered the ""taboo"" roa of boofing. Well, being prescribed Oxymorphone for the first time and doing research, I knew orally was out of the question. So I went to the drug store and grabbed a 10 mil oral syringe, filled it with water and squirted it into a shot glass, heated the water, chopped up a good ol' G72 and mixed it all up. I typically add one of my ir oxy 15's if I'm gonna snort it, but I figured I would just do one 10mg panda as a first time experiment. I go ahead and fill the syringe emptying the shot glass and I just sit there literally for an hour contemplating if I'm really gonna put something in my ass that had been a sacred ""exit only"" for my entire life until now. Eventually I said to myself,  suck it up and man up and just do it. So I grabbed mine and my wife's KY and lubed up both my ass hole and the syringe and boom, I shove it in a couple inches as researched and plunged down slowly. After I took it out, I laid there for a few minutes as recommended and after that I didn't feel anything so I got up basically disappointed and thinking I was done - giving up on boofing. Feeling disappointed and violated, I began to chop up a line in post boofing depression when BAM it hit me, and when I say hit me it was like the one time I had IV morphine in the ER after a motorcycle accident.  Fam, I tell ya it was like nothing I have ever snorted before and it was only a 10 mg panda (fast, heavy onset of wonderful blankets of pulsing warm euphoria)  and I'm used to snorting 30 mg oxy.

Thursday-9:30 am
Picked up 6, 4mg dilaudid between me and my lady. 2 in a rig each for work, saved one for home. Getting paid (bonus!) on Friday so just doing it to get well through the day. Ended up potentiating with 4 0.25 mg Xanax and getting everything done at work. Boss is thrilled. Tell him I’m trying to get some work done at home tomorrow and he gives me the go ahead to work from home (LOL) Friday. Great. Bang the 3rd dilly when I get home and take another 0.25. Fly through the night clean the house, have some opiate sex that can’t be beat (no cum of course but hey c’est la vie.) 

Friday- 2 am
Dilly connect calls saying he’s gotta leave town for 24-48 hours and offering to front us the 10 dillies we usually get on Fridays when the check hits right then and there. Don’t gotta ask me twice haha. Head down to him. Throws me 12. Sell 3 to my neighbor (I don’t tax him he’s my friend) and we stay up all night chillin smoking blunts and listening to music. It was great. Pass out at 6:30. Work” is at 9.

Friday- 9 am
Holy shit I feel like crap. Open the laptop, pay the rent, the bills and answer some emails. Smoking a fat joint of course. Finish the “work” around 11. Sleep til 3. 

Friday- 3pm. It’s time. Start banging the dillies like they’re going out of style. We’re safe, use clean rigs, 3 auto injectors on hand just in case, plus we are each other’s “Narcan butlers” if she takes a shot I don’t for a minute and vice verse. Neighbor comes over. Smokes some weed with us and we chill and get takeout and drink some beer. 

Friday- 8pm. Our weed/coke man calls up and offers to throw us some Bars (gg imprint 2mg) and weed for free since we made him dinner the other night. Weed was fire, bars were as always great to potentiate  and chill. Got an 8 ball too and just spent the night railing that shit plus doing modified speedballs (no dope obvs). Snuck myself a 20 rock too because crack is bae. Pass out at 8am. 

Saturday -6 pm. Wake up feeling how you expect to feel. Check the mail walk the dog, smoke a blunt, and who’s driving through but the ice man. I hate ice for the most part but if I have Xans, I can get rid of the shit aspect of it. Cop some ice, smoke it up, bang a dilly and take a bar. Now fucking rocked, smiling, laying with my love and my other love my dog. Life is good man. When this lifestyle works it works. But tomorrow I’ll be back in my suit, heading to work. Not gonna touch shit for a minute obviously. Gotta at least pretend to be managing.

I know that type 4 diacetylmorphine is a salt and technically water soluble, but when it is in the water before heating it seems to sit at the bottom whilst the water stays clear, not dissolving, while as soon as I add heat it dissolves and turns the water a honey color. The normal amount of water that I use is 80ml, and after heating and filtering I get about 72-75ml back. I don't like to use any more than that because I like to leave a small space at the top of the syringe so that I have some room to pull back and check that I'm in a vein without popping out the plunger, I actually prefer to use less water so that it's more concentrated, but I worry that a smaller amount of water won't be able to absorb all of the product.


I've now read that it's totally useless to heat the solution beforehand, that all it does is dissolve insoluable additives while evaporating some of the product. However, much of the internet seems to be giving me conflicted information. I use .5 most of the time that I use, which is mostly every weekend.

As with always should be the case, i never let money walk, but ive even done that on small amounts. (On a side note, when dealing with the homeless i always offer to either buy them some, or throw them a $20 for the help).

Nothing has ever worked and its getting very frustrating. I don't look like the typical addict because im still a little overweight and i dont shoot, so no track marks. But, i also don't in the least bit resemble a cop. So, i understand why someone wouldn't just walk up to me, but theres no reason if i walked up to someone that there ever be a doubt that im a cop either.

After the pain slowly built from like a 3 to a constant 8 I went to the doctor, who remarked that it was among the worst he had sever seen, and informed me that my ear was nearly completely swollen and fused shut with puss. 

He gave me antibiotics and much to my surprise a script for 7.5/750 Norco's.  

I took them as directed to manage the pain, but after the infection cleared up I was left with about ten of them. Over the course of around sixty days I took the pills for reasons ranging from migraine to just wanting to feel a little good that day. 

I have like, no tolerance for stuff like them so i get quite a powerful euphoria from them, and just feel like a much happier person. That being said, I understand their risk for addiction and thus never let myself take more than a single pill every three or four days at most. In fact, I gave them to my husband to keep so i have to ""Ask"" for them, so i have someone keeping an eye on my intake.

So being the good little junk box I am I hit the streets, off on another cold copping adventure.  
It didn't take me too long to find 2 guys (we'll call them L and D) standing around, looking like they hadn't washed in a week or 2 - perfect. This was far from my first time doing this, so after a quick chat and the promise of a bag they jumped in my car and directed me to the spot. We get there and they ask for my money, I laugh and tell them no. I was only spending £20 so we eventually decide that one of them would stay in the car and the other would leave his phone with me while he went and waited for the runner. I was still wary but figured eh, worst comes to worst I could probably get close to £20 for the phone anyway. Thankfully it didn't come to that, a few minutes later L jumped back in the car, drugs in hand. We swapped numbers, I dropped them back into town and went on my merry way.  
Over the next 8 months I'd see L and D almost every day, so I'd like to think we got to know each other pretty well. There were a few times I was short and they'd cover it for me, and a few times I helped them out too - all was well in my little bubble of opiates.  
Last night I went to pick them up like normal, but L wasn't there. No problem, me and D headed to the spot by ourselves (something that had never happened before). I didn't think twice giving him my money, it's the same routine I'd done with L for months. He hopped out the car... and that was the last I saw of him.  
30 minutes later I get out and go looking for him... vanished. I check the other spot they sometimes wait at, not there either. 8 months of helping each other out, spending at least an hour a day chatting, all gone for £25. What really pisses me off is if he'd just asked I'd have happily broke him off something, but instead he had to be a greedy prick and take it all for himself.

Don’t start IV’ing. It is overall the most dangerous ROA, and don’t take that as a challenge. It requires being skilled at all aspects of vein care and venipuncture, as well as sterile technique to reduce the likelihood of health problems, and even in the best of circumstances things can and DO GO WRONG, even in a hospital. So imagine what you are likely to pull off in non-sterile environment without formal training from a tech.
Mods: if this isn’t appropriate to post, please delete. I am doing this with the intention of harm reduction using information gathered from online research and my own personal experience.

Okay, that introduction was long for a reason: I needed to included all that info and to maybe weed out anyone not patient enough to read it to get to the IV’ing part. If you’re anything like I was when I first started, you’ll sacrifice your arms (and brain) in the name of getting high (science).

Syringe choice: BD (Beckton Dickson) syringes are known in the IV community for being the smoothest plunge and having the slickest needle. You should always *always* use a new pin/rig/syringe, but if you’ve ever found yourself with only a used one of your own, bleach it and use BD brand always because they’re also known for maintaining a smoother entry on second use (Not that you should, it ruins your veins and raises the likelihood of infection and vein issues). 

If you buy an all-in-one (AIO) syringe with a non-removable needle, do your veins a favor and don’t get insulin syringes. Thanks to u/GeneralCha0s for educating me on this. Why? Because insulin syringe needles are designed to dive through layers of subcutaneous tissue (Not veins)and they leave a hole, rather than a slice in the vein, which takes longer to heal and contributes to fucked up veins faster than using a hypo needle which is *designed to pierce veins*.
Yes, it will take you longer and may initially be more difficult to hit with a different rig, but in the long run, it is worth it IMO.

BARREL SIZE: If you are going to the lengths that I did (in the name of science) to find the perfect rig, I suggest detachable needles. If your hit is over 45-50 units, get a 3ml syringe barrel. The bigger your hits get, the harder it is to keep your hand steadily in one place on the syringe. (You’ll need to be careful to go slower pushing your dope in to not blow a vein, since 1/4 inch plunge on a 1cc has less force than a 1/4 inch plunge on a 3cc—I did the research on PSI’s in syringes. It’s a fact).

Anyways, in a 1cc with a giant hit, your thumb just isn’t long enough and you’ll end up creeping along the syringe like I did, missing the vein or slipping out and wasting your dope and hurting yourself in the process.

If you have long fingers or a ring on the end of the plunger, different story. Carry on. Smaller than 50 units can stick with a 1cc/ml.
Also, make sure on any rig, to prime the barrel. This is a medical thing that means taking the plunger and pushing it in and out to make the plunge smoother before you draw up.

NEEDLES: think of this as being like the fork you eat with (yes, please eat). You wouldn’t eat a bowl of cereal with a fork if you had a spoon. Don’t use insulin syringes or needles for veins. They’re not meant for veins. You’ll spill your cereal/milk trying to hobgobble the shit in your mouth (vein).

BD needles are the best, hands down. Some ppl prefer Terumo if you’re not in the States, which is good also, but I already mentioned why I like BD’s. 

LENGTH: If you have fresh veins that are relatively shallow, go for 1/2” to 5/8” needles. You’re less likely to puncture through the back wall of the vein (I hear stories a lot of people swearing they’re in the vein because it registers, but feeling burning). This is why. Puncturing all the way through a vein, registering while pulling out, and putting the dope in will make it look like you’re there when you’re Not. The result is a fucked up vein that may not heal and a pocket of dope that may  abscess.

For scarred or deep veins, go for a longer needle (not my thing, maybe someone can chime in on the length & gauge).

GAUGE: in general, the smaller the needle, the better. Less damage overall if you’re shooting clear or H but if you’ve got a thick shot, a slightly bigger gauge will work a bit better. Most can fit just fine through 30g.

They do make needles that are 27g with a wide bore (just means the hole is bigger for the dope to get through without putting a bigger hole in your vein). Check it out.

Once I started using the right equipment, I had much better highs, less, wasted dope and no misses. A miracle for this dope fiend. I do have a lot of info on aftercare, but I’ve made this post long enough.

TL;DR, use the device that gets you there with the least damage so you can keep getting high without moving to your neck, groin or other dangerous sites. Bonus: when you quit, your veins are likely to heal much more quickly.

Edit: FWIW I used to be a phlebotomist.

Edit 2: I used insulin syringes for years but couldn’t make them work for me the past year. This is why I went Bill Nye the Science Guy all up in this bitch.",1517061744.0

No idea how long one card lasts on average for maybe a couple to few months? Just broke another one and it's getting annoying. I would really love to find a card to use that would last me much longer. They end up splitting down the middle to the point where they break in half and are unusable.

The other question is about waterloading. I am coming from a place here not of daily use...I only used twice (about .2, then waited two days, then maybe another .2, probably less), but I figure there is really no point in pissing within 48 hours of using, even if I drank all of Lake Michigan? Am I wrong here? 

After the 48 hour mark, at least with just using once or twice, i figure waterloading may be able to save you. 

Anyone have any experience with this? Anyone pass sooner than, or at 48-72 hours by waterloading? I know nobody can tell me for sure whether or not I'll pass. My u/a's are monitored and I'm a female, so substitution is really risky and maybe not even possible...

I haven't told another living soul this and I never plan to but I have to tell someone. I even made a throwaway I'm so embarrassed/guilty. 

It was me who clogged the toilet at work. We have a small office so it's 1 toilet for the men and 1 for the women but somehow I was able to avoid getting singled out or even suspected. I clogged it so bad the plumber had to come in. Idk how much he charged but it wasn't fee.

Idk how I was able to ignore for so long but as soon as I sat down I knew that it was *about to go down* (or I wished it would go down). I even had dope in my system... Took a shot a few hours earlier, didn't matter the baby had dropped my water broke contractions were very close together this baby was ready to be born.

Once I sat down and realized this was happening I started doing the math in my head. To my horror i concluded that I hadn't had a bm in about  2 weeks (13 days to be exact). 

I've read stories on here that claim to have been longer even weeks longer in some cases and God bless you all because 13 days is a personal record I do not ever intend on matching or God forbid breaking.  

A 13 day old piece of shit was in me and was more than ready to leave me. I'll spare everyone the details but omg was it something I never want  to experience again for as long as I live. 

Before I do anything I get up and have to look at this thing I mean cmon. I wouldn't say I was proud but a small piece of me did want to take a picture( I didn't). I swear it was bigger than my roommates new puppy which is about 6 pounds. I can't even think of the adjectives I would use to describe this thing so I'll just say it was fucking huge. According to South Park 1 Katie couric is approx 2.5 pounds of shit (source: http://southpark.cc.com/clips/1cgdy1/crap-verification ) so I honestly felt like it was at least 3 Katie courics. I'm a big guy and I ate regularly for 13 days. 

So naturally any regular 1.8 liters per flush American standard toilet wouldn't have a chance and ours didn't. Of course that bathroom doesn't have a plunger (there is one in there now 😅😈) I was in there forever trying to get rid of this shit and finally got it to the point where the toilet looked fine but almost overflowed every time you flushed it.

A lot of people were out to lunch so I slipped out the back door. I went and did my daily lunch shot and everything seemed normal when I got back. It wasn't until a few hours later that someone mentioned the toilet was messed up. We couldn't even plunge this thing the plumber had to come and idk what he did but he was there all afternoon. 

There wasn't much of a hunt for who done it although everyone in my department was saying they knew it was this guy Z in my office. Don't really have anything else to say other than sorry.

I had to tell someone but all of my friends are normies and wouldn't really get it like you guys with the way dope makes you not shit. If you read the whole confession thank you for your time.

Why did you decide to try it? What happened that night, etc.etc. 

I remember my first time like it was yesterday. I remember the fear and excitement and honestly, everything about it. 

I was so scared to use. I thought I would drop dead the minute I inhaled it, lol. I had been mainly using morphine and dilaudid, sometimes percs. I banged once or twice, but mostly just sniffed it. I had been curious about dope, and had a close friend who had started using again. 

We went out to the beach with this girl who was using back page at the time. She would pretty much shove lines right under our noses all night. 
I did my first line and five minutes later, was raging. Every single thing was annoying and made me mad. So I did another line, and another. I was nodding out, talking to myself, not making sense. I remember we hopped out after driving her around to different guys to grab a drink. I couldn't even walk. They had to help me into the bar. Tried to drink something, but couldn't and honestly, didn't want to. Which was saying a lot because I was a pretty bad alcoholic. 

It ended with me basically crying for Wendys. Really wanted some of their baconator fries. 

I used for the best couple days as well and they all kinda blended together, but it was fun while it lasted. I miss both of those girls and that plug. Not sure if it was just my low tolerance or what, but we all swore that was the best dope we had ever tried. ",1517193135.0

Turns out 2 days after I got out I find out I’m in big trouble for some stupid shit I did before I went to rehab. So I get arrested for a felony theft charge, and pretty much lose my job that I have been at for 6+ years.

I was devastated but I stayed sober for just a little longer than 60 days and relapsed on 4 mg dilaudid. I had some money put back for emergencies that went fast without working. When the money ran out my dilaudid plug would give me fronts, it was cool no big deal. Pay him when I could. Well I started to rack up that tab. I would pay for them when I could but if I couldn’t come up with any money, he would just throw me a couple and all was good. 

Well lately trying to find a good job with a felony theft arrest has been proving a little hard. I haven’t been convicted yet. I hope my lawyer can get it dropped and expunged. First time being in trouble blah blah blah.

My plug, his wife passed away last month, the lady I would call momma and it was a sad deal. But he has continued to front me. I probably have a tab close to 800$ right now. I feel like shit for getting it up that high, but also very thankful that he continues to help me. I will get my taxes back within the next couple of weeks and I’m going to pay it all back and then some just to show I’m extremely grateful that he has helped me so much.

I love opiates. I also haven't touched them in a month or two. I don't even remember when the last time was.

This isn't some situation arising from a lack of availability, although I suppose it helps that my closest source is about 90 mins away in a sketchy part of illinois. I also use a range of chemicals but opiates, especially oxymorphone or heroin, are the center love of that enjoyment.

I also know what it's like to be a slave to this stuff. When I first picked up painkillers around 17, I knew this was what I would always love. I also ended up quitting right before I was desperate enough to start injecting since I knew that was gonna mean no way back for me. Did a bunch of lsd and cleaned myself up.

So maybe I'm just lucky? Some weird set of circumstances where I got hooked quick & psyched my way out of it means now chipping with arbitrary lines drawn in enough to keep things from being bad enough to make me say screw it and jump on the h train to oblivion? Or am I deluding myself (as I'm sure all the replies are gonna be cool, stop while you're ahead then).

But like, when I use and when I get to using regularly enough, it feels like I notice the diminishing marginal returns and can tell myself 'well, time to face the flu and anguish, wait a few months, and hop on that crazy ride again.'

Idk. ""I'm not special"" and ""I won't be able to do this forever"" are always in the back of my head but sometimes I wonder if that's what keeps me fine. When I'm off I really don't crave much at all. Just kinda think, ""oh opiates, right. Those are nice. I sure could go for some but eh...""

Idk. Anyone else chipping successfully at 5+ years?",1517169151.0

I am not referring to ULDN (which never worked for me at any suggested level), but doses high enough to potentially produce low-grade precipitated withdrawals. 

After scouring the internet, it appears that people who take doses of 1 - 4.5mg WHILE dependent notice a tolerance decrease the following morning. Some report it even eliminates the growth of tolerance, the payback being a ""minor withdrawal"" for an hour each evening after the naltrexone is dosed.

I am currently 8 months into a daily Kratom habit - generally three 5-6g doses a day. I have skipped a few single days and did not notice any serious withdrawals, but never more than 40 hours. 

Yesterday, 18 hours after my last kratom dose the previous evening, I decided to try out LDN. I had etizolam and gabapentin incase things got too rough.  

11:30am: 1.5mg NTX

T+45min: I began to notice aches and pains I hadn't noticed the prior six months. My stomach also felt knotted for a few moments, but that went away. My eyes and nose began to run a bit, but nothing too bad. My mood was still basically fine. 

1pm: 2mg NTX

I took 2mg of etizolam at this point in case the restlessness got too much. I felt a minor increase in withdrawal symptoms by 2pm, but I can't say it was worse than coming off a minor habit. I felt some restlessness, a bit of anxiety, but it was very manageable.

I awoke at 6am today and took a 4g dose of kratom. The effects feel a little stronger than a 6g dose - nothing clearly beyond placebo at this point - but this was a haphazard first attempt. I want to continue playing around more to find the right time-frame and dose. 

I believe small daily doses of NTX are (or ""may be"") much more beneficial than ULDN, which I have not heard any real-life positive experiences about beyond ""I think it's working."" I think some actual, noticeable antagonism has a greater effect on discouraging opiate down-regulation. ",1517158737.0

I know at my highschool I was paying 5 bucks for 40s, 5 bucks for 80s sometimes, and often getting free pills for little favors and fun.  In that environment, it did not take long to become quite addicted to oxycodone. It was months of use before my first taste of withdrawals, but when they did hit, damn.

      I remember being home alone, luckily, and just not able to be comfortable. Hot and colds. Fucking bone pain. Rage. Crazy RLS. Fiending.You know. After that experience, I tried to manage my sources a little more carefully and started my habit of immediately hitting up dude after school. Somehow, I managed to keep my scholarship, but to assure my receiving it I still had to go tutor second or third graders at the end of my day, sometimes sick as fuck...And those kids, man, they knew something was not right. It was beyond fucked.
   
      That's also about the time I started listening to my Dad's collection of John Prine and began to be haunted by the song ""Sam Stone"", and began to realize I was a junkie.
Fast forward a few months to graduation, I blew 2 80s right before and looked like a fucked up ghost, barely able to walk. The resulting photo of me receiving my diploma was, needless to say, horrific. 
  
     As you can imagine, it wasn't long before I began thinking about the needle. Promises of better highs and lower usage and all that. Thank God I was aware of the extreme danger I was playing with and after failing due to not tying off properly, said fuck that. A nicely deviated septum it would be. 

     Apparently observed by angels, I discovered a solid Methadone connect in yet another one of my young peers from school. Soon freed of my increasingly expensive oxy habit of 60-80 dollars a day, I actually starting doing much better. I was using my scholarship at least. 
   
     So I started on Methadone right before 2004. 2004 is also when my future wife and I began living together. Thank the makers she wasn't a junkie too.  By 2008, I knew I had to get off the shit, but I had no idea how.    By this time I didn't even know how many of what pills I was doing.  To get a handle on my situation, I started a Pill Journal, trying to document myself for myself.

     I did this with varying success for 3 years before I finally got to that famous place all good junkies eventually enter. I fully understood what being sick and tired of being sick and tired meant. 
     
     Finally, through a series of divinely fortunate events, I got an excellent opportunity to quit in March of 2011.  It started with a dinner with my then soon-to-be fiancee who I had somehow managed to hang onto. We're having drinks, waiting for our server, and next thing I know I'm nodded out, waking up to a super angry soon-to-be fiancee.  See, I'd gotten very good about not committing the sin of nodding, and had managed to stay on my girl's good side because of this. Now, I hadn't nodded in a public place in a good while, and doing so for the first time in a while was suddenly, extremely embarrassing.  Next day I went out to help my mom and consciously halved my dose so as to avoid ""The Conversation about Methadone"". Which of course we talked about. Leaving my mom's on my reduced dose, listening to some song about marriage, I realized if I was to get married, is have too get clean.

So I did. The next day, I hung out with my best friend, who didn't approve of my use at all. Again at half my usual dose, I realized I had been tapering for 2 days, so I might as well keep on it.     
     
    This was my chance to quit and I fully embraced it. I kept halfing my Done till I could take morphine. I halved the morphine till it was a few milligrams. I spent the next month feeling crazy, but I got better. On my brother in law's birthday in early April I took nothing, but was able to eat. A month later I felt like my head was screwing itself back on, and every day I got a little better.

     Now free from my demons for the first time in my adult life, I got to work. Asked my girls Dad for permission to marry his beautiful daughter. I bought a $5000 Tacori engagement ring. Bought a $9000 wedding package at a Couple's resort in Negril. Life was great. I was getting married to the love of my life and things were amazing.  

      This lasted almost 6 months.  AND THEN.....I got hurt. We were on a float trip. There was rope swing. Ok. I swung out of the tree like a dozen people before me, but landed on a jagged-ass rock, and gashed a hole in my leg. I  bleed for 5 hours. After 2 days it still hurt like hell, remarkably it wasn't broken though. I started to think opiates would help, and tracked down some morphine. 

To be continued, I'm  wishing I could fucking  sleep tonight but I'm gonna keep trying.",1517294809.0

Holy shit though. I can't believe I've made it this far. I didn't think I was going to be able to, forreal. I know that everyone around me didn't think I could do it either. 

I've never done 100% abstinence before. And it's crazy how it's getting easier every day as things even out.

I had completely accepted that I was a junkie no matter what and I was going to either die in an overdose or get killed  by a john or in some other fucked up situation. 

I never thought that I had a chance at a normal life. But now I'm starting to see that it is possible for me to stay clean. That maybe I won't die young. That there is hope. 

I'm not saying I'm going to be perfect or stay clean forever, but I'm going to for quite a while. I'm not going back anytime soon. 

There is hope guys. Seriously.

The line going from the very bottom, to the middle of that histamine reaction, is a scratch from pulling a rig out of my arm and dragging it down my arm accidentally. Stupid stupid me haha.

As far as for all of the little veins all over my arm, they always rise to the surface and are red like that. It happens all the time if I'm too cold/too hot/exercise a bunch.
I've had the reactions where it gets a bit warm and stuff around the site. This time it almost looks like it is going out in squiggly lines, and then started getting red in between them to make a full red spot, but you can still see the darker parts in it. I did the shot, and went to type some messages, and when I looked down it was there. It happened very very quickly.

I don't believe I missed the shot.. It didn't hurt, and I re-registered halfway through the shot and all way good.

I have already taken a Benedryl. I'm not sure if I should do a hot compress, or if that would just make it worse. Please help guys!! Picture incoming!",1517289649.0

I was put on 16 mg of suboxone a day exactly two weeks ago, and having been down this road before I know I only need 8mg a day to feel normal. So this last Saturday the 27th, I once again fell to my vice and copped half a gram.  I hadnt taken my subs for about 30 hours so I definitely felt it, probably around 80% of its strength. 

Now prior to me getting on subs, the dope I was getting was definitely fent laced, I know this only because I would get sick a measly 5-7 hours after a shot, not because of its strength, it was pretty weak, like a 4 out of 10.  But the dope I got on Saturday was from an old connect that went dry months ago because he actually had a conscious and wouldnt sell any dope laced with fent.  He calls me (unaware of me being on subs) saying hes back with his original product which is about a 9 out of 10, easily the best Ive ever had, and I succumb.

Sorry for the long rant, heres my question.  I did the last of the dope yesterday morning around 10am, a tiny line and a cotton from the night before, just to get a little buzz, was FAR from what I could do. This was the same dope I was doing probalby 6 months ago, and would start to WD around the 16 hour mark. But its been about 29-30 hours since then, and I have zero withdrawal symptoms, not even sneezing-which was always first for me.  I desperately want to get back on my subs, but am terrified of precipitated WDs.  Is it safe for me to take a sub tonight? Every site on heroin WD says they kick in 8-24 hours after last shot.  Has anyone ever had similar experiences?


TLDR have been on subs for 2 weeks, stopped Friday morning to get high Saturday, havent had anything in roughly 30 hours-still no WD symptoms, is it safe to take my subs again?",1517277489.0

I started escorting when I was almost 18 to get away from my parents. They weren't abusive but I felt suffocated. They used their money as leverage and it made me feel like shit. I bounced around on the East Coast for a bit but after a serious depressive episode I moved back to the midwest to live with them. It was about 3 months after my 18th birthday when I moved back with them. I enjoyed the lack of responsibility, the lack of rent, bills, etc. Not having to escort to pay my bills was a big weight off my shoulder. It was during this time that I started injecting heroin. I also overdosed for the first time in my life. A few months later I moved out again but got an apartment just 10 miles from them. I burned through my cash fast and at this point I was sober and going to AA. Well of course I relapsed soon after I moved. I went to the psych ward and then got high for a while. I eventually joined an intensive outpatient program which helped a lot. About 5 months after I moved into this apartment I decided I had enough of this small, grey town and picked up my stuff and moved to the Southwest. I started attending community college which made my parents happy. In return they covered my living expenses. Of course here I relapsed. I started escorting again and using heroin but neither of the two stuck. I would have short binges of both activities but mainly focus on school. I began to become really unhappy. I hadn't made any friends that stuck around and spent most of my time holed up in my apartment. I was now 19. People at my school weren't too friendly. I would start doing heroin every few months for a few days. I would escort here and there to bring in extra cash. I made the decision to drop out of school about 6 months after I moved to the Southwest. I packed up my shitty 18 year old beater car and drove it all the way up the coast. I landed in a new city. No job or school lined up. Lots of cash in savings from escorting, no real relationship with my parents at this moment. I moved in with this random girl and to be honest I feel really lonely. My landlord just texted me and made it clear this apartment wasn't even a done deal so I have all my shit here and I might have to move out tomorrow. Nice. I would like a normal job but I have to pay for a surgery that I need. So I guess I'm just gonna be escorting to pay my bills and keep my savings up. I don't know. I'm stressed and lonely. I want to get high, but I want it to be different. I would always get high alone or with this one girl who was dumb as fuck back south. Either way wasn't very fun. I wish I could just meet some chill people and fuck around with them. I'm over it. I'll be 20 this summer.

Well, right after I started copping off that dude, he got a new batch and the quality was horrible. So I started going through the middle again because he had some other connects with absolute FIRE. Real dope, no fent or anything. 

Today, when we get to the street we're meeting the plug on, the middle says ""I told him you're from (very, very rich/ snobby suburb of our hometown that is already considered rich and snobby to begin with), that's why it took us so long to get here"" 

That's when it occurred to me that he had told his plug he'd be frequently bringing a ""rich white kid"" that he's middling for/ taking advantage of from the suburbs through, in hopes that the plug would throw him a bunch of free bags for the business. ( because he couldn't charge me more than it actually cost anymore, I told him the only way I'd start going through him again is if he only charges me what he's getting it for per bag, and I'd just throw him some bags for the help) 

This is extreme bullshit, because not only am I not from said rich/ snobby suburb, I am NOT rich or anything else fitting the stereotype of the residents of said suburb. I've posted screenshots of how this middle talks to me, demanding I get more money than I can as if I can pull money out my ass. 

He even has told me to steal money from my parents, and tried to get me to pawn my laptop or guitars on the empty promise that he'd pay me back come payday l. 

Anyway, he gets back to my truck and hands me the bundle that he copped for me, and then I look over and the plug is beckoning me over. So I walk over to his car, ignoring the middle asking me ""wtf I'm doing."" When I get to the window, his plug asks for my number so he can send me his info, then hands me a completely free bundle, despite being told that I'm some rich white kid. 

Of course, the whole ride back to his house, the middle is bitching at me, telling me it's not safe and that I need to keep going through him if I don't want to risk my life and all this stupid, racist shit. Bitch, I lived in the hood for 6-7 years when I lived off campus for school, including 2 separate trap houses. And that whole last year living up there, I was cold copping just about every day. Pretty sure I can handle myself.  

So I now have not one, but two of this middle who tried to violate my shit's main plugs. It was a good day, r/opiates. 

PS I'm sure some of you are going to tell me that this plug only wanted my number because he believed the middle about me being a rich white kid from a really expensive suburb. When he texted me his info so I'd have it, I made it abundantly clear that my financial status and location were greatly exaggerated. He said doesn't care, as long as I'm regularly copping off him.

Right now I'm weak. Depressed. Broke. Alone in a foreign country. He saw that. Has been watching me preying like a lion. Then tried to strike. Acted like he was trying to be nice. 
 
I thought he just wanted to be a good friend. I only hung out with him for a total of 8 hours. Initially talked to him because he knows dealers and I'm tryna get rid of some subs. Said he could help. Obviously did not have sex with him not that it matters. Only thing he bought me was a pack of cigs but at the end of the 8 hours he acted like I was indebted to him. 

Now he's blowing up my shit ringing my apartment building door ringer thing and he told me ""u have a problem and you don't know it"" I've ignored him since. He also told me he's watching me on the camera. 

Thank god i talked to a good friend after hanging out with the creep. The friend advised (thank you I'll always be grateful for you, you know who you are)  me to stay away and knocked some sense into me because I always assume people have good intentions and if dope isn't involved I'm the one that gets manipulated. 

MY WOMEN AND SISTERS BE FUCKING CAREFUL. ITS NOT A SAFE WORLD FOR US. IM IN THE ""first world"" there are predators EVERYWHERE. 

Also don't get the wrong idea I'd die before prostituting myself. It'll never happened has never happened. He really would have had to abduct me. But imagine if it was a girl that was slightly more desperate. What a piece of shit. 

What kills me the most is all his friends saw what was happening knew he was trying to meet and groom a new girl into the life and no one said a thing. How could people just let this shit happen. 

I've been worried he'll break into my apartment do something as a warning like kill my cats. Abduct me. Dude it's half paranoia half fears based on fact and logic. I can't go to the cops I'd also die before being a snitch. 

I told my dealer about this he told me he'll have people on my street look out for me. I can't sleep at night. I'm sorry this isn't opiate related. But I had to share. This is turning out to be a rough year. Im a fucking dumbass. 

I have to be strong. Sigh. Also I gotta move out of the hood. 

If anyone has some advise on what to do if he gets more aggressive if ignoring doesn't work please let me know. Thanks. ",1517268648.0

7twjop,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7twjop/methadone_is_very_very_kickable/,12,https://redd.it/7twjop,beekeepersmyth,"Methadone is very, very kickable.","This is a post for people who are wanting to kick hardcore opiates. My advice can extend only as far as my own experience as I'm not a medical professional, so understand that this (and most of the information you read on the internet) is just my own experience.

I was on methadone 80mg/24hrs and I was so sensitive to withdrawal that I'd rock up to the clinic every day with my eyes watering, yawning, with a runny nose and aching everywhere all over my body. I didn't handle any physical or psychological discomfort well at all, which helped lead me toward opiate addiction. Prior to methadone I started with uncontrolled low-dose pharmaceuticals like Neurofen Plus that helped me control symptoms of depression. Of course, barely any time passed before it was Panadine Forte and doctor shopping. After a while, I was ingesting so much ibuprofen and paracetamol that my liver and kidneys started showing the early symptoms of disease.

So, heroin was a logical choice...you know...to 'be healthy'. Haha...I still laugh at that justification, I actually can remember saying it to my dealer who died in a public toilet later that month. There's just enough truth in that particular justification for it to work...so it's kind of genius. I can still hear my internal thoughts about it from back then and I seriously can't help but chuckle. 

'Well mate, congratulations, you've stopped putting that sh*t ibuprofen and paracetamol in your body, it's just pure opiates now which are practically HEALTHY!'

Nek minnit...

Full blow heroin addiction for two years that destroyed my life completely. Sure, the first few months were great. You've heard it a million times, so I won't repeat it too much but EVERYBODY thinks they can have a handle on it. They don't. I'm yet to meet a single person who can control hardcore opiate usage. But the demise of my life is a whole other story, and is none of your concern. You're thinking about kicking so, here's the kicker:

I then tried to rebuild my life (and finances) by going on the methadone program and moving in with my Mum at age 30. I started psyching myself up for rehab as I didn't like how unmotivated and isolated I felt. I wanted to get clean and have a better life for myself. So, the month before rehab, I started using on top of the methadone. Fentanyl patches and snorting china white. I overdosed twice that month and nearly died.

Anyway, when I was in rehab I was going to gradually reduce my dependence and jump off around 5mg. I went in on 80mg and over a week got down to 70mg. Now...this is just me, but I was wondering why I was prolonging the inevitable. One morning, the nurse gave me 7mg instead of 70mg. The doctor had filled my order wrong and it was taking a long time to get her on the line. Something about the chaos of the doctor being unreachable and the nurse refusing to administer my normal taper combined to make me realize that the only solution I had was to take responsibility myself. The thing that made me laugh is that the 75mg dose of the previous day was clearly visible.

I walked out the door a week into the program with only a small reduction to show for it. But here it is...I just stopped taking everything. Completely cold turkey. Here's what I was ingesting daily when leaving rehab.

75mg methadone
150mg sertraline/zoloft
150mg lamotragine
40mg diazepam
20mg tamazepam

I was a cloud of meds, high and unclear.

I would only put food and water in my body from that point on because I was so utterly over the chaos and drama the drugs were causing me. I'd tried to kick before, but this was different. I was taking back control through responsibility. Having said that I felt awful for a month and not quite right for another three after that.

The point is this though...when you're ready to take responsibility, you can kick anything.

I'm not kidding when I say this, but my life turned around so quickly. I got a job I love that pays well, I'm going to the gym regularly, I have an amazing girlfriend who is not only a babe, but a great human and I live in a clean, nice house that I love coming home to. I've been both fortunate and brave. I endured the suffering I had to go through and came to see suffering as something I needed to take on my own shoulders and not shirk or outsource to others.

In short, I'm a man with meaning in my life that isn't overcome with resentfulness or loneliness.

I'm happy to answer any questions, but just know that if you want to take responsibility for yourself and take the burden of living on your own shoulders - it's not only possible to redirect your life to something beneficial for yourself and those around you - it's essential.

This is a pretty specific post, but I'm hoping that someone here can help.

I take kratom regularly. I've stopped for my trip. The withdrawals are much worse than I anticipated, much more like normal opiates than I imagined. I'm looking for some way to get myself through this. Not looking to get high, just to not withdraw during this trip. It was a last minute trip, and a ""surprise"", so I didn't get to plan it as well as I had wanted.

I know that kratom is banned in Ireland, and I believe the UK. So that leaves me with two options: lope and codeine. 

Is codeine still OTC in Ireland? Anyone have information about that? 

The problem with lope (which I'm taking currently) is that it sounds like you can't bring much into the country. I bought two of those 200 count bottles, which helps a bit through the withdrawals, but it's not perfect. I take about 20 a day currently. As I said, the withdrawals are bad. But with Ireland, the max you can buy is 20 ct at a time, which would be a huge expense. And you can't bring in bigger bottles than that, according to a lot of forum posts of people in the same situation.

So I could buy it there as the worst case scenario, but I'd really rather not. It would be ridiculously expensive. I don't have much money at all (the trip was completely paid for, never left the country)

So I'm hoping that maybe codeine is still an option there. Not sure how it works OTC, or however it is. 

Any advice from anyone? Thank you for taking the time to read. It's an oddly specific post.",1517264696.0

Feeling really bummed out today...

I have a friend, I'll call her Jane, who I have known for 20 years. Her and I are both heroin addicts, but we don't use together. We have our own separate lives, but we talk just about everyday and we help each other out when we're in need. 

Lately, I've been in need a lot. I don't have a car, my job has drastically cut my hours to 1 or 2 days a week (currently looking for a better job) and my husband has recently had major back surgery so he can't work rn. The one good thing we have going is that in less than 2 weeks we will be receiving a large settlement from the insurance company. 

So, for the past 2 months or so, Jane has really helped me out, above and beyond. When I've been in wds she's given me 30 Gabapentin, 2 suboxone, a bunch of muscle relaxers, and some seroquel tabs to help get me through the days when I can't get any opiates. She has even brought them over to my house for me and given me a couple packs of cigarettes. 

When I have the money, she has picked up my dope for me (when she was picking up for herself anyway) and brought it to me when dboy couldn't come out to me, and she has picked me up to take me to see him with her. 

She really has been a damn lifesaver and I planned on making everything up to her when I get the settlement money. Also, she has offered all this to me, I never had to even ask. 

So yesterday, I had some money and dboy was going to come to me. In the morning, Jane texted me and said that she was going to see him anyway and would come pick up my money and go see him for the both of us. I told her that he was coming out to see me and she said it would be faster if she just went to see him so I didn't have to wait until he could come out here and that she didn't mind at all and was happy to do it. She was picking up her other friend (well call Kelly) anyway and they were going to see him. 

So I said ok, thank you, etc. They come and get my money and I threw her $20 for gas/whatever. I was getting 6 bags (his bags are .7 each) they were gone a little longer than usual but finally came back about 2 hours later, dropped it off and that was that. 

Well, 4 of my bags were short. They were only.5 instead of .7
I asked dboy if they were short for some reason and he said no, they were all .7

They pinched .8 from me. Fucking .8!! I always offer Jane some for going through the trouble, she always declines. Yesterday was no different. 

So I confronted her and of course she blamed Kelly. My husband is pissed. They stole from us when we hardly have a penny to our name, and we gave her $20 AND we offered to give her some H.

I'm conflicted because yes, she stole from us, but she has been so good to us the past 2 months that I'm not sure if I'm even allowed to be mad. I'm actually really hurt by this but I don't know how to handle it.

Anyway, my husband wants to cut ties and definitely not do anything for her when we get the settlement. I'm not sure what to do.

Any advice?

tl:dr  Good friend pinched a lot of my bag, I owe her a lot for all she's done for me over the past 2 months. Do I forgive this, or am I right to be angry?

Long time lurker.

I am currently in a sub program but not always doing what I should be doing. Currently getting prescribed 6mg, but usually take 2mg when getting sick. Other times I am just using, but he does not UA me as much as I should (Knock on wood).

In addition, I get clonidine, 0.1 mg, prescribed to take two a day, but only given 28 pill. Therefore he is not the most intelligent person because this does not last me even close to a month.

I take the clonidine to help with anxiety as well as sleep. I was wondering what are your thoughts of me suggesting benzo or trazodone for sleep. I usually take the 0.2mg (2) clonidine at night to help with sleep but it has not been working as well lately. My question is should I ask him to prescribe me those pills or no. 

In addition to these two medication, he also gives me Lithium and Wellbutrin both of which I do not take but he thinks I do. 

P.S. First time poster (hope I am not breaking rules, and hope to get clean soon but too dang hard!

EDIT: Thanks to all that replied, I figured I couldn't Benzos but I wasn't sure if anyone had any similar situations to this. Plus, he did offer addy for when I am off the suboxone as I am still in grad school",1517252174.0

My drug of choice is heroin but I haven't even touched it in months. Here and there I have taken small doses of subs and lope when the pain is unbearable and I need to sleep or whatever. One other time I got a script of codeine from the dentist. The codeine didn't give me any sort of buzz at all but couple days after taking them boom back in withdrawals. Every time I get some clean time and it seems like my withdrawals are almost bearable and even if I have the slightest tiniest taste of any opiate it seems to restart the whole process even loperamide ????

Now Ive seen and read a little about this coca cola thing where you put the pill in coca cola and let is sit for like 24 hours and it blows up in size. Im curious what exactly is the point of that? Does it make it so you actually feel 40mg or 80mg when you take it orally cuz i know compared to swallowing an old OC 80 the OP 80s feel more like 40mg. So im just wondering if putting them in coca cola for 24 hours is to make it feel like the actual mg it is? If so is that the best way to swallow them or would it be better to cut them up into pieces with fingernail clippers and then let them soak in coca cola? Im just trying to find the best way to take these and get the best results.
                  Ive been on methadone maintenance for over 3 years now and after 6 months of it it stopped helping my back pain. So for the last 2 and a half years ive been stock piling opiates to take when i get off the methadone or maybe down to 10mg.(currently im on 52 but about to go down to 50mg tomorrow) In the last 2 1/2 years ive bought 1 gram of U-47700, 1 gram of furanyfentanyl, 3 25mcg fentanyl patches with the gel, 3 opana 40mg ER made by global pharma so their crushable to snort and shoot or so ive been told, 200 percocet 5s(I do the Cold water extraction well used to), and 4 OP oxy 40s. Before I got on methadone AKA Satan's drug I was prescribed 30mg roxicodone every 6 hours and those 2 years were the best of my life! Had a full time job, a car, money but now i literally spend every day every hour lying in a bed. Thats my life now. Its to the point where im avoiding taking showers cuz i cant stand up long enough. I used to shower every day but now I get a shower once every 3,4, or 5 days and im FUCKING 25 YEARS OLD!!! I think about suicide all the time but i believe in god so if i kill myself i will go to hell. So i decided to get a hold of a gun, call the police and tell them some bullshit story that i just killed my parents and when they all show up with their guns aimed at me raise my gun so they will shoot me probably 20 times and kill me. Thats the kind of shit I think about. I suppose you have nothing but time to think when you live your ENTIRE LIFE in a bed. Sorry for the long dramatic post. I went way off topic, so someone please explain whats the deal with putting OP oxys in coca cola and someone please tell me the best way to take them orally to get the best results.",1517246915.0

But seems like lots of good people, useful info, and entertaining stories to say the least. 

Anyway, to the post. So long story short, I’m a pretty small guy (currently around 5’4 130lbs +/-) I got pretty serious into lifting in high school and through the first year or so of college (until the real addiction started taking hold). In that time I never got very big because I still lacked proper nutrition, etc. but I was very fit and lean. 

Currently, I haven’t been to the gym (or done any real physical activity, except for at work) in at least 8 months, and my diet pretty much consists of heroin, cigarettes, Red Bull, milkshakes, and pretty much anything sweet or terrible for you lol. 

But I feel like I look great! I’m obviously not as toned as I was when I was going to the gym 5 times a week, but I’m still around the same weight, and thin but not “skinny. ” I honestly feel like I look better than I would if I wasn’t using, or going to the gym. 
Not to mention, I seem to have gotten many more compliments on my looks/eyes while high, but that might be a coincidence. 

So what are you guys’ thoughts?

Btw I didn’t really mean for this post to be this long, I finally just got my fix after being sick for the last 3 days on top of recovering from a car wreck 3 days ago, so I’m giddy lol. Also, nice to finally “officially” be a part of the community!

They also sold fent as dope to an old acquaintance of S's who ODd from it and fucking died. She shouldn't have let her money walk but we are all fed up with this horrible excuse for a person and so she told me she is going to try and trick them into doing dope cut with a ground up sub pill (maybe more like sub cut with dope, not sure what her plan is exactly). My question is will this even send them into precipitated WD? If one shoots dope and sub at the same time is it a similar effect to taking subs after doing dope? Has anyone ever experienced this, either purposely or accidently or done to you without your knowledge?  


Seems like involuntary precipitated withdrawal is essentially torture, but doesn't leave any (physical) marks and is likely not life threatening. This got me thinking, is there any evidence that governments or other malicious organizations have used this as an actual torture method? Switching between the calm and peace of opiates to the pure hell that is precipitated withdrawal... I can't imagine anything that would be worse especially if it was dragged out over days, weeks, months... Goddamn it's fucked up what people do to people. At the same time, I can't really feel bad if this guy ends up in precipitated withdrawal for an afternoon, would be peanuts compared to what he's done. 


To be clear, it's not me who is planning on doing this, but I am curious about if it will be effective. So, share your experiences with me please my friends.

I certainly haven't heard this one yet, but hopefully it's not your first time and can offer some clarity.  I've been on Subs for 8 years now and something odd has happened over the last 12 months that has me freaking out.

The first seven years (or so) I was stable at about 1.2-1.0mg/day without issue.  Suddenly a year ago I started having terrible stomach problems which I can only think was digestive paralysis which caused really bad acid reflux, very poor appetite, etc.  Around that time, I dropped my dose a bit to see if it would help and it did.  Reflux subsided and digestion improved.  However, I ended up right back at the same spot again just a couple weeks later with same 'ol ""taking too much"" symptoms:  not digesting, constipation, sinus congestion, joints not cracking, back pain, low libido, minor headache, too tired, etc.  So I had to lower dose again to steady myself.  This has gone on for 54 charted weeks where I recorded my daily doses and I'm surprised to see that I dropped over 50% from about 6.5mg/week to now less than 3.0/week.  That's right, I'm doing about .5mg per day now in an effort to keep up with what my body is doing, and now I'm at the point that I have trouble getting to sleep, not feeling like I'm taking enough to get through the day, etc.  Each time I've dropped I've had some w/d but lately it's way less intense.  I used to get RLS like crazy but now it's more of just trouble sleeping.  Last week, I lost some hearing in one ear because of how congested I am.  Usually I can drop my dose either for a short while or permanently and the snotfest starts and all sinuses drain.  Didn't happen this time...it's like the w/d aren't even going to start.  

I must be nuts, but are these lower doses that much more powerful?  Or is my brain shutting down not-in-use receptors now?  More importantly, what the hell is my body doing?  Why this forced taper?  It's like I'm fine for 2 weeks after a small drop, and suddenly I'm still on too much.  Could really use some feedback for cause.  The only other thing I take is vitamins and antacid.

I feel like at this point I'm going to have to either stay at a steady dose as long as I can and see if my body re-adjusts (and hope my hearing comes back/sinuses drain/can defecate, etc.), or just try skipping an entire day or two and see if that kickstarts minor w/d because it feels like I wouldn't even get it anymore.   

Anyone out there ever had their tolerance drop automatically like this?  How do I get it back up? ",1517377697.0

He was different from others and he got pain killing plus an energy boost from morphine/h. But that only lasted two weeks.
Any apparent boost in energy the substance was able to provide was only present for two weeks maximum. Then the permanent sleep would start to take hold. 
So although he got energy upon second try, two weeks into the addiction, he was effectively almost permanently asleep. It took him years to learn this only because of how hard the stuff was to get where he was located. 
 He also told me that refined opiates were only mans way to take far too much of a plant that is dangerous enough in its natural form. 
He also told me that bone density loss and hypogonadism are not worth the temporary relief or apparent benefits of even raw opium. Or any of its derivatives.
He was lucky enough to find subutex in a time capsule and tapered off using that once his injuries (the original reason for his use of opioids) healed.

In the play, a character is addicted to painkillers, and I want to make sure I'm portraying her accurately.  I am NOT looking to vilify the person with this addiction; I am looking to, as always, be honest.  Whenever a character's experience is outside my own (as this is), I want to try to get as much input as possible from people who have the first person perspective that I lack.  So, after checking with the moderators, I wanted to ask you all this question, and you can either post your response publicly or PM me, if you like: How do you perceive the world when you are high on painkillers/opioids?

I get that some people feel that way- The National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse defines addiction as:
“Addiction is a complex disease of the brain and body that involves compulsive use of one or more substances despite serious health and social consequences. Addiction disrupts regions of the brain that are responsible for reward, motivation, learning, judgment and memory. It damages various body systems as well as families, relationships, schools, workplaces and neighborhoods.”
https://www.centeronaddiction.org/what-addiction/addiction-disease
People argued that the addict chooses to try the drug and therefore is responsible for their reckless behavior/they are not victims of an addiction. What about people who get hooked from a doctors prescription-it can be as innocent as a small script after wisdom teeth removal to trigger an addiction. 
So I know how I feel- I have had my own struggles with addiction & watch the show Intervention (I know a watching a show doesn’t make me an expert—- also I have another post about the show Intervention and their work in the Heroin Triangle) and strongly do feel it’s a compulsive disease that needs treatment or over time it can lead to death or other dangerous health issues. I get that to some maybe even most that perhaps comparing addiction to say a child who has cancer who has “no choice” is absurd. However what the definition above is saying is that the addict has no choice either bc their brain chemistry changes. 

So in your opinion, why or why not, is addiction a disease? ",1517340409.0

To foster safe use of loperamide, the FDA is working with manufacturers to use blister packs or other single-dose packaging and to limit the number of doses in a package, the agency said.
The FDA is asking manufacturers of loperamide, which is available OTC and by prescription, to change the way they label and package loperamide to ""stem abuse and misuse that leaves us deeply concerned,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement.
In 2016, the FDA warned about life-threatening cardiac events, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest, with loperamide misuse and abuse, as reported by Medscape Medical News.  In 2017, the FDA added a warning to the product label about the risk of taking high doses of loperamide. 

The FDA notes that some individuals are taking higher-than-recommended doses of loperamide to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use.
The maximum approved daily dose for adults is 8 mg/day for OTC use and 16 mg/day for prescription use. Loperamide is safe at these approved doses, but the FDA continues to receive reports of serious cardiac problems and deaths with much higher than the recommended doses of loperamide, primarily among people who are intentionally misusing or abusing the product, the agency said.
Packaging Could Help

Evidence suggests that package limitations and use of unit-dose packaging may reduce medication overdose and death, Dr Gottlieb said. Today the agency sent letters to OTC manufacturers requesting that they implement changes consisting of packaging limitations and unit-of-dose packaging.


""We're requesting that packages contain a limited amount of loperamide appropriate for use for short-term diarrhea according to the product label. One example is a single retail package containing eight 2-milligram capsules in blister packaging. We asked the manufacturers to take the necessary steps to implement these changes in a timely fashion to address these public health concerns,"" Dr Gottlieb said.
He said the FDA will also reach out to those who distribute loperamide online through retail websites to ask them to take voluntary steps to help address the problem of loperamide abuse. ""The abuse of loperamide requires the purchase of extremely large quantities. Often this is done through the purchase of large bottles of loperamide, which is a common configuration in which the pill form of the medication is currently packaged. Today's action is intended to change how the product is packaged, to eliminate these large volume containers. We know that many of the bulk purchases of these large volumes are being made online through major online web retailers,"" Dr Gottlieb explained.

I know I have. Burnt by dealers, middle men, cops, other junkies, etc. But has there ever been a time you just fucked yourself and no one to blame but you?

My example or story was a few months ago. I took my lunch break to pick up 2 buns. This was pretty normal. I had taken my break to pick up before, I'm able to do it in the amount of time needed, my guy picked up and was waiting for me. So I go, pick up, do a few on the way back to the train, and get on. Everything seems fine. All went well, right? Well...i get off at my stop and while I'm walking up to the doors, I realize my pack of smokes (which I put the buns in) wasn't in my pocket. I had put the pack in my hoodie pocket. I searched all my pockets like a crazy person, retraced my steps back, and get down in time to see the train pulling away. I realize the pack fell out while I was sitting on the train. Fuck. I just lost 16 bags. They're on this fucking train that just pulled off going to Penn Station. My mind is racing, trying to think what to do. There's a fucking pack of smokes sitting on that train with 5 cigs and 16 bags. I tried figuring out how I could get to that train before they cleaned it or someone swiped them. I thought maybe I could wait for the train to come back and catch it. But how would I know what train? Which car? Which track? There's no way I'd be able to find the right train at the right time AND someone hadn't picked them up already. I had no recourse. Not to mention I had to get back to work, so I couldn't just chill at the train station all day hoping the same train came back to this station. There was nothing I could do and they were gone, traveling the city by themselves on this train, destined to be someone else's high. 

The only thing I could think is ""someone is going to have a GREAT day finding that pack."" lol

So, ladies and gentlemen, was there ever a time you just fucked yourself and it was all on you? And stay safe!",1517336374.0

There are rocked bits here and there but for the most part it is just powder and is being sold as tar. My question is: what exactly does this indicate? From what I understand #3 looks very similar and has to be broken down with an acid before shooting.

(I know, right? Total shocker. LOL.) My dope fiendedness (Yeah, that’s, FOR SURE, not a word. Ha ha ha.) is only rivaled by my dick piggery. (Man, the “words” I’m using today, I’ll tell ya what!)

Anyway, when this story took place, I was successfully just “chipping”. (As a matter of fact, I’m actually still just a “chipper” via some sort of fucking magical miracle. Ha ha.) Thus, I wasn’t even sick when I did this... I just absolutely refused to wait. AT ALL. 

SO, I didn’t have access to a vehicle when this all took place, thus I got an Uber to take me into the nearest city (which is approximately an hour away) and had him drop me off at spot set up by my d-boy. After some mild confusion (which actually had my dude laughing at me as opposed to being annoyed/pissy with me, which was nice) I met up with him, picked up my shit, and started back towards a spot where I could easily pick up another Uber to take me home. 

Unfortunately for me, there were ZERO businesses around with a public restroom. And if you think I was gonna wait until I took the hour ride back home to rip into a couple of those puppies then you’re fucking crazy, mate. LOL. So, as I’m tooling around these side streets and alleyways, my dumbass rolls a twenty up into a tooter, rips open 5 bags, dumps ‘em out onto my phone, and then quickly dips beside some rando’s garage and snorts those babies down... er... up. Whatever. 

Looking back on it, I’m pretty damn lucky nothing went wrong! There were people milling about all over the place, so it was quite the “bold” (fucking stupid) move on my behalf. 

Anyway, how about all of you lovely folk? What’s the most dipshit move you’ve made trying to fix up (or even just cop in general as I’m starting to have my doubts that very many people are as fucking moronic as I am.) while in public?

Also, did I mention that I tend to ramble like a son-of-a-bitch when I’m rocked? Yeah, I sincerely apologize for the horrendous length of this post. (Please don’t stop loving me due to it!! I don’t have any bropiates in my “real” life.) Anyway, that’s what I’ve got! How about ya’ll?

I have a tendency to grind my teeth while I sleep, so this could have potentially been worse. My tongue is CURRENTLY REFORMING back into its original shape,  but for a while it looked like a piece of silly putty that had been malformed with a pair of scissors.

One of my friends was the only dude with a plug and I put in a a decent amount of research before I committed. I 

decided my dosage for first time would be 10mg’s and my girlfriend was gonna do 14mg as she has a higher tolerance to generally every drug regardless of its effect. We took it and felt amazing for a couple hours, I mean it was spectacular if everything has just stop and that was the only thing I ever felt I would be content. 

After 2-3 hours I couldn’t stand up from the nausea. I couldn’t even sit up, but I was determined to play video games and consequently I threw up a couple times. 

My girlfriend decided she wanted to increase the nod slightly as it wasn’t hitting her like it hit me because of her general tolerance so she took .5mg of a xannax and she had a great time.

 I realized the danger and the love for the feeling is one that I never wanted to be accustom to. I knew that if I became comfortable with it I would be addicted.

Over the course of 4 months we did it another 5 times or so. 3 times it was my friend’s plug, one time it was an OP80, I did the Coca Cola method and did 40mg of that. I noticed something strange, it didn’t feel the same as the other ones. I wasn’t as nauseous, it didn’t feel as good but it wasn’t making me sick. 

After mentioning it to my friend he talked to his plug who he was decent friends with and he said it was slightly cut with heroin. In my mind I knew that didn’t make sense, too expensive and too difficult. I needed a new plug and after a couple a days I found one. They were smaller than the other ones I got but after comparing online the other ones were significantly bigger than normal. I snorted a quarter of it, I felt nothing. I snorted another quarter and felt a slight high but basically nothing. 

I started talking to other people and found out they are fent pressed and because of that my tolerance to opiates are supremely higher than most beginner’s. 

My question is, is there anything I can do about this? It’s extremely frustrating but it could ultimately be for the better. I’m just upset as I can’t have that feeling again without going to a dangerous dose for a beginner. 

My gf and J  experienced a range of health concerns after every fake 30. Blood in pee, hangover the next day, hallucinations While high similar to MDMA Dreams, in and out of consciousness while high. Extreme nausea to the point we couldn’t stand 10 minutes into the high and couldn’t sit up with it having to throw up.

I don't wanna come across as a dickhead and ask him if I can buy his oxy from him, since he still might need it for his pain. But I was thinking about offering him $100 to get a new bottle for me after he didn't need it anymore. 

I took 2mg Xanax XR a few hours ago, and then 800mg Tagamet just 45min ago to potentate 15ml of Tussionex (Extended release Hydrocodone, 10mg per 5ml). I really don't feel much now and that was the last of my opiates :(

The other Complete bullshit thing is that they said after 90 days of clean drug testing they will give me 1 day a week of take home medication. Well its been 90 days.

Another dealer (who I'm on hella good terms with)that definitely has a similar source called it devil dope and that he refuses to get the real stepped on shit. So I asked him if his supply does have purposefully bad shit or different kinds of dope or if they just have one version of dope they sell. He got weirded out and told me to never ask about his suppliers ever.

Well a few months go by and I holla at the first dealer. End up getting the devil dope. It is some kind of opiates cause you will feel well. Get it switched out but he tells me ""my bad I mixed up by bags.""

Tan on the left, Grey in the middle, tar on the right. One piece of tar looks kind of lighter because it had just been ripped off the huge ball of tar he had. Wish I could have just snatched that shit and ran but I would have gotten killed lmao. One time he opened a whole jar fully of Oxys in front of my face and said ""damn I bet you wish you could have all these."" lmao fuck you

I'm sort of new to dope. Not sure which kinds are best for what and such.

My usual guy (as mentioned above) had the tar and tan until recently sold me some grey shit calling it ""china."" I thought it was but it ran on the foil and smoking did have some effect. but so did snorting. idk. Can someone help me figure out if this is #3 or #4 or what? It's really nice regardless. Probably his best product no matter how you use it. I don't think I've ever seen ""china"" or ECP in real life, so I can't speak on it. (Posting pics of all 3 types shortly!)

The tar is bomb, I like smoking it. but its easy to go through quickly. It's sort of brittle so usually ill do a few lines of It too.
The tan is okay, obviously #3 or freebase or whatever the term is. It's sort of looks like very light brown sugar. Can be snorted for longer but less intense effect than smoking.

I'm about to cop. what would you cop?

Edit: From the midwest if that helps. 
I copped the grey and tar but wanna know what you guys think because he's my go-to guy.
Also how do I go about anonymously posting a pic of it? I'd love to show it off.

I would also really like to know If this grey dope is actual #4 even though it runs on the foil.
I haven't seen many posts about grey #3/free base (are they the same thing?). It's usually tan. If the grey is #3, what are the BA's of intranasal vs inhaled? Can I use an Emergen-C packet with citric acid/vitamin C to turn it into #4? If so, can I just mix them together and snort them, or do I have to do It in water then snort the water? Could I make a nasal spray? Is there a way to isolate the citric acid and/or vitamin c?

Lastly, since the tar is brittle and easy to crush down and snort, does that make it lower quality? I usually smoke like 3/4 and snort the other quarter. Should I switch that around, skip snorting it, or skip smoking it? I assumed the intranasal bioavailability is stronger.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST. Can someone PLEASE explain the numbering system. I get #1 is a form of morphine precursor to heroin. I'm not sure what #2 is and if it is different than #3? Is BTH even on the list? Or is the system its so old it doesn't apply anymore?

He doesn't presently owe me any dope but there is an odd $20 on my balance sheet that he still owes me from the recent past. When he says that he's *working on it*, it is implied that he is going to share the dope that he obtains upon conducting the trade.


On more desperate days when I'm not sitting on subs, I'd be checking in every few hours, ""did you trade yet?"" It has been two days since he said it ""should be tonight."" 

I still can't say enough how happy I am that I'm not in need or counting on anything he says.


&nbsp;


###Later during dinner he texted...


  Cliff: Yo u at work? **Its important** man


  Me: I'm looking to eat dinner when I get home after 8. What's the emergency?  (It's a lie, I'm already eatiner dinner but I'd prefer him to think I'm not home just in case...)


  Cliff: Could you grab me a couple of 2 liter sodas that are 2 for $3? I'll compensate ya for it


  Cliff: **If I drink water again I'll die**


  Cliff: **Figured you could use a bump**


&nbsp;


Umm yeah, no. I told him I can't do it. What I love is that he's looking to compensate me with a bump. Is that a bump from a single pill? Perhaps he'll crush up two roxy 15mg's, snort some of it and let me get the remaining table scraps?


I'm tempted to ask what the definition of ""bump"" is in this context but I don't want to make him think that I'm remotely willing or able to buy his shitty soda. 

Anyway, his response to my not being able to get soda was ""Damn it"", so no hope of dope.. good thing I don't really care.

&nbsp;


###Recap: 


Cliff picked up his own damn Xanax on Monday because I made damn sure not to do the pick-up. In the past he'd ask me to bike to the pharmacy for him. If he didn't have any roxies to give me which he usually doesn't by that time of the month he'd entice me with a dream.


One time he texted, ""would you do it if there was a chance that you'd have something to do before work?""


Subsequent times I knew there was no chance that the benzos would get traded for dope before work but still held out hope that it would be handled by the end of my shift.


&nbsp;

He might've successfully traded benzos for a sharable amount of dope on one out of six times in the past few months. Each time I picked up the benzos I'd deliver them then wait and spend the day checking for status updates while Cliff would ultimately get barred out and nothing would transpire.


I found it frustrating because I would wonder to myself, ""how is this dude going to answer the phone for a prospective buyer if he's so barred out?""


&nbsp;


Well, this week has been great for me. I have enough subs to get me through pay day and beyond. By that point in time I will either see a doctor or get a bulk street discount through my own new connect. 


Either way, I am not buying dope next pay day. I am not buying dope and I am certainly not sharing or loaning any to Cliff. 


At some point when I see him or when he calls my phone he's going to ask what I'm looking to buy next week. Something like, ""How many buns on pay day?"" At that point in time I will have to disappoint him.


Perhaps he'll act like he understands and supports my decision but he'll more than likely try to talk me out of it. 


&nbsp;


My next posts will include:


* How Cliff reacts when I tell him that I am not buying dope on pay day next week.


* Dreams, motivations and aspirations. (Think Forrest Gump running across the country but with a bicycle)

Do any of you use opiates for pain associated with scoliosis? Upon request I thankfully received some Vicodin but only a very limited supply.
I haven’t used dope in almost two months and I don’t want to get into the habit of using it regularly.

I had a nasty back injury about two years ago. Long story short after trying a variety of painkillers my dr settled on morphine. I had a natural high tolerance and it took 80mg in the beginning to dull the pain enough to function.
By 6 months later I had stabilizes at around 200mg twice a day.

Keep in mind this was enough to dull the pain but not to do much mentally.

My ex learned of the doseage level I was on and, came to the determination that it was not acceptable even though prescribed by a very solid smart dr. And decided she was going to cause me a great deal of grief as far as my parenting time with my son went unless I stopped taking it.

So I saw another local dr who specializes in opiate treatment, as I wasn't too keen to suffer through withdrawal.

He suggested Suboxone, and it took 16mg to get me comfortable after 2 days of withdrawal.

I was trying to get off of it as soon as possible and 8 weeks later was down to 2mg per day, but my back pain was so terrible that I had to go back to 16mg to even make a bit of difference.

So that's gone up to 24mg over the past 2 years.

It hardly helps my back pain, has given me terrible headaches, I feel like I'm never well rested and wake 2-3 times per night and have a variety of other very undesirable side effects.

So I've spoken with the dr and asked about alternatives as I'm stuck with this injury for life.

What he basically said was fentanyl or hydromorphone would be the two options but he was concerned about tolerance and such.

Then he was recommended methadone.
My first reaction was as you'd guess, being as all I knew of it was the taboo and stereotypical view of it.

However after doing a fair amount of reading it sounds like it can be pretty great for severe long term pain. And I wouldn't have to go to a clinic or anything.
From what I read it's one of the best for long term serious pain.

Anyway as I consider my options I'd like to know what the transition from Suboxone to methadone would be like? Do you end up with any bad effects from stopping the Suboxone as I've heard horror stories?

How is methadone for side effects? As I've had a hell of a time with Suboxones side effects.

What doesage of methadone would a person have to take to switch from 24mg of Suboxone and to still help with pain?

Are there any side effects as far as energy, libido etc vs Suboxone?

I'd appreciate any firsthand knowledge and info possible.

Thanks folks",1517443512.0

**1-20// More of the Same**

&nbsp;


Got high again today but I don’t feel too guilty. Smooth knocked on the motel room door at 9am to collect the money I owed him. I didn’t get much sleep due to what I can only assume was a prostitute in the room next to mine. From 3:30am until past 6am she would scream and moan loudly in the way only prostitutes and porn stars do.


I fronted a $20 off Smooth at 9am and managed to fall asleep by 11am. At 3pm I woke up and departed to collect my check and pay Smooth back.

———-

At this point I stop writing due to how rough I feel and continue to tell the story the next day. I’ve taken Kratom and I’m smoking tons of weed with a house full of people in bay city for a smoke off. I feel good and want to write so I continue the story where I left off

———-

It was the first nice day in awhile in Michigan. Most of the snow has melted and this decaying area seems to be absolutely glowing. I’m not high but I’m not sick either and it’s the closest I can feel to normal lately so I can actually appreciate the view. The beauty is almost too much to take in after the dull motel room and I have to put my head down briefly.


I know what Elliot Smith means when he said “gonna walk, walk, walk, 4 more blocks plus the one in my brain”. The walk is 20 minutes but feels like 30. I run into Smooth and he tells me he took a hit of acid. In my experience whenever black people take acid it’s really funny and this rule once again proves true. I pick up my money without incident and pay back what I owe plus buy a fat $60 of some truly garbage dope. It’s pretty much a white trash dope fiend shit show after this so if you’re reading this expecting the diary of Anne frank you picked the wrong read.


I do the true dopefiend move of using a public bathroom to shoot up. Of public bathrooms places like McDonald’s are the least junky-ish in my opinion. I go to a cafe that has a bathroom key you have to ask for because people come here to shoot up. I buy a $1.75 San Pellegrino and not just because it’s what Patrick Bateman drank in America Psycho. It was the only water available.


The key is attached to a big tin mug and I feel stupid to be on such an obvious dope chase in front of all these nice college students. I try to make small talk with the cashier by complimenting his tattoos. For some reason I bring up prison and how the prison tattoo guy spelled my mom’s wrong and it is very awkward and cringe worthy. Sarah said I was high functioning autistic once and even though she said it was just meant to be an insult I always suspected she may have been serious. Maybe she has a point, but at the time none of this mattered. I had picked up a wet dirty cigarette butt from the parking lot because this reality is better than the nightmare of cooking up a shot and not being able to draw it up.


I put half of the dope in my cooker. It’s super light tan rocks that dissolves very quickly in water. I draw up using my disgusting cotton, register, and slam quickly. Despite being a large shot the effect isn’t much more than a slightly improved mood with that very little rush.


It did have enough of an effect to make me decide to go over to Brian’s trap house of an apartment. He had ripped me off a few weeks earlier but he has the best plug, Polo, and I consider asking him to cop for free to make up for what he owes me.


I foolishly buy another $20 of shitty dope from Smooth before entering Brian’s. Brian isn’t even there and it’s just Katy and two younger black crack dealers who I didn’t think I knew but one remembers me. He says he saw me overdose at the trap before and thought I was going to die. This is not the first time I’ve heard things like this. I genuinely like Katy and kind of missed her. She’s gone from snorting to shooting heroin but her main addiction is crack. She asks me to buy a hit for us and since I’m using her house to get high this is etiquette. I call over one of the dealers and ask to buy a dime rock. He makes a minor show of acting like he’s doing me some huge favor because “I usually sell $20s, dog”.


I break the rock in half and prepare another shot of the shitty dope. I load the pipe with my rock and smoke it completely and manage to shoot my weak dope before exhaling a cloud of crack smoke that’s still so big after holding it in I know it’s going to be a strong one. The hit of crack was generous but nonetheless only $5 worth but it’s potent so I get a minor bell ringer. The cocaine is outperforming the heroin by a long shot and I don’t really feel much of anything from the heroin.


Brian returns and makes an apology and agrees right away to buy me 2 packs for $30. 2 packs would normally be $40 and I’d have to break him off one effectively making one pack $20. One pack is guaranteed to get me anywhere between “plenty high” to overdosed. I putz around running to the store to buy single cigarettes and drinks. The dopeman Brian goes through, Polo, has drivers that deliver for him which is usually an indication of good quality product. He says 15 minutes and usually takes 30 but today he’s true to his word. So is Brian and he delivers me 2 untampered $20s of very potent dope. Even though we are both strung out I first feel respect for him making it halfway right. Then I see regret for ripping me off flash over his face in a genuine and unpretentious way. I am able to forgive him and go to get high on some good dope for the first time in a while.


Things blur and the night ends.

&nbsp;



**1 - 21// Return to Bay City**

&nbsp;



Today is Sunday so I’m going back up north to Bay City to see Sarah. She’s staying at the house of a guy she cheated on me with when I was locked up. The fact I put up with this says something about how much I love her, or maybe how pathetic I am. I pick her up and she is in a surprisingly good mood and lunch goes fine. I have purchased 3 bottles of Kratom to hold me over and they are doing their job but do not take the edge completely off.


Sarah wants to go to a “smoke off” so we call a ride from our friends Allen and Marcus. Sarah, Alex (Sarah’s nephew), Allen, Allen’s girlfriend, Marcus and I all pack into a tiny hoopty car that looks like it can barely drive. Due to all the weight the wheels are constantly scraping and I’m terrified of getting pulled over as I have warrants. We must have looked ridiculous, 2 people in the front and 4 people crammed in the back. Not to mention Sarah, who is a rather large girl, is sitting on my lap and has to lean her head down due to the car roof.

We swing by the house of an old Vietnam Vet who grows medical marijuana and I buy $40 worth of weed. I also buy Sarah some alcohol to improve her mood and make her tolerable to be around. We go to the house of an older, white, gang banger. If there’s one thing more pathetic and cringe worthy than a white gang banger its a white gang banger over the age of 30. Bay City is kind of a white ghetto and a lot of people here are white trash. Allen, his girlfriend, and Marcus are good people though.


More and more people arrive and it turns out I’m the only person with weed. I feel like Sarah used me since it’s always my money spent on weed. It hurts me that she cares so little about the money I have to work so hard for (I make $8 an hour) but I’m sure the thought never crossed her mind. There’s a guy there Sarah fucked when we were broken up, he’s older, drunk off his ass and has a crack pipe in his pocket. If this is one of the guys she sleeps with what does that say about me? I try to block it out of my mind. The conversation is local gossip and vapid bullshit so I decide to read my book. When there’s a group of people around I can’t get a word in with Sarah because she makes herself the center of attention. If I try to tell a story or comment on the topic she raises her voice or cuts me off, to be fair this rude habit of hers applies to everyone though. This used to upset me to no end but I’ve grown used to it. Seeing how little she values my opinion or conversation does hurt though. In my head I call this the “Sarah show” because of her tendency to hog the conversation and stand up during the long diatribes, usually about other times she got drunk or just plain old shit talking a person who is not there to defend themselves.


Sarah wants to smoke crack and tries to get some from a wigger for free. I text her angrily and tell her if she smokes it I’m leaving. Even though I haven’t remained sober I am trying and if she smokes crack it means I will too. I would never bring drugs around her when she’s trying to stay clean but I’ve never expected this same respect from her, nor have I ever got it.



The chance to score some benzos arises so her nephew and I quickly depart to buy 30 Valium. Although she expects me to give her 15 of these for free she does not want to walk the 10 minute trip to grab them with us. I buy 20 of them and offer Sarah 7. She is not happy with this even though 7 Valium is a large dose and she didn’t pay for any of it. She throws a minor hissy fit and insists she won’t feel it at all… even though she ends up being belligerent due to the mix of benzos and alcohol. The Valium takes all of my concerns and self esteem issues away and I feel human again. All I want to do is be quiet and spend time in my own world where the cares and stresses have melted away.




Time ceases to exist and my memory and consciousness only come in flashes. I’ve taken 30mg of Valium and now I want to write again. I’m with Sarah and it’s going surprisingly well and my prospects of sex look pretty good. Getting and maintaining an erection will be hard and I will not likely be orgasming. At this point I take more Valium and I am near blacking out. I awoke to these notes on my phone


On 70mg of Valium sobbing gotta write notes before I forget. Sarah found journals and is done with me.

&nbsp;



**Days Later**

&nbsp;


Sarah broke up and is now threatening legal action. I don’t know where to start. I guess it would be best to begin where I left off, but I took a lot of Valium and my memory is fuzzy of the period that follows. I met someone from Reddit. An Asian girl living in Japan (but formerly lived in America), it feels stupid to talk about this on something that people might read… but it’s a special relationship and I am hesitant to discuss it further.


**Update** *The girl and I have been talking non stop as of the current date (1/31/18). She’s amazing and means a lot to me already. I’m glad that reddit could introduce me to so many supportive people.*


Sarah went through my phone when I passed out from the Valium and read my private journals I had never published. She freaks out that I have written about her, even though nothing negative had been written and it was mostly all about how much I loved her and how much unreciprocated love hurts. She is yelling at me and telling me to call my Grandma to come pick me up even though it’s 3am. She threatens to hit me if I don’t give her 3 more Valium. I hold my ground and not just because I want the Valium for myself. I can tell that this is the real, permanent break up but for once it doesn’t break my heart. The girl I’ve been talking to has made me feel like I’m worth being loved for the first time in years. Despite the insults being thrown at me I fall asleep smiling but deep down I know the Valium is partially the cause. I have taken 10 10mg Valiums at this point which is a big dose for me.

&nbsp;



**1 - 22// Grandparents**

&nbsp;



The next day I wake up still in a haze and have my family pick me up. Since Sarah has read my journals she saw I had relapsed and told my family. They tell me they’re not taking me back to Ypsilanti and I don’t know what to do with myself. Home is death for me, the last time I was at home I overdosed twice in three days. I have a life, a job, and true friends in Ypsilanti. Thankfully I am able to convince my family to let me return and I only miss one day of work. I return to the crack motel on Tuesday January 23..


I have a good amount of money and make the poor decision to get high before heading to college. I am registering for late classes and need to take placement tests. I buy a few $20 folds of heroin through Brian and it is amazing dope. I ride the bus to school and manage to find my way to the testing center in my heroin daze. I can’t tell if the placement test is really easy or if I’m just dumb and it’s all going over my head. It turns out I get a perfect score and qualify for everything. For the first time in a long time I am proud of myself.


Like a true dopefiend I manage to parlay this success into a failure. Instead of returning directly to work I head back to Brian and Katy’s to get more dope. The dope and crack takes hold and I become “stuck”. Being stuck is when you start getting high somewhere and don’t leave until all the money and drugs are gone. I keep telling myself “I’m only an hour late, I can make an excuse that the test ran late”. One hour turns into two and eventually it’s 3am and I’ve missed my shift completely. Brian and Katy begin arguing over missing packs of dope and it looks like it’s going to get physical. Plates get smashed and I decide to leave before the cops show up. I find out later the cops did show up but they didn’t answer the door. The walk back to the motel is cold and lonely but the opiates filter this experience into a pleasant one.

&nbsp;



**Wednesday 1 - 24// Addict Excuses and 3rd Chances**


&nbsp;


I know I am in trouble at work and I’m afraid to go in. I message the group chat with a bullshit excuse. I tell them the night before I left my phone at college then got on the wrong bus and had to walk 10 miles home and that’s why I missed work. I really doubt my co workers and managers believe this but they don’t call me out. I feel an incredible sense of guilt over lying to these people who have been so good to me, given me so many chances and shown me more love than people have in years. I want to change so bad and there’s nothing I desire more than to make these people proud. They took a chance hiring a drug addict felon and I’m letting them down. I won’t give up though, I will beat this disease. Despite everything they allow me to work but tell me one more no call/no show and I will lose my job. I resolve not to let them down like I do so many others.


I did not plan on sharing my journals with people I know in real life, but Sarah posts them on facebook to show everyone I have relapsed.
 I manage to stay off the heroin and only take Kratom. I don’t feel too bad surprisingly.

And I gots a question for female users.","First off, I missed y'all! And I appreciate all the messages I got checking up on me. It means a lot to know I am cared about. 

Secondly, this post is about Aunt Flow so boys probably want to stop reading now. 

I have been using for 4 years, and have kept a regular cycle except for months that I was stressed out. I didn't even know until reading on here that usage effects such issues. I snort, so I'm basically curious if the stopping of mother nature has to do with usage methods. Like if someone snorting has different effects than someone shooting? 

I've had times I was using a gram a day and still had my monthly visitor, so I'm doubtful that matters. 

I also know addicts get pregnant all the time so obviously they had to have been getting their cycle too, right? 

Probably sound stupid asking all this but this is one of the many things I've been pondering lately along with if its possible to mentally control withdrawals, using myself as a test subject so its probably a biased view. Curiosity kills this cat. 

Which reminds me since I'm known for my kitties on here, they are all doing extremely well. Not so much kittens anymore since its suspected one is about to make me a granmammy any day now. The doggies are doing swell as well, they have birthdays coming up so gots to plan and plan lol. ",1517436349.0

Personally, I only overdosed once when I went for the holy trinity plus fentanyl and klonopin.  This was over the course of two days and by the end of this binge I was caught by my sister and dad in my house blue as shit and barely breathing so they called the emts and reported an unresponsive person. I live about 3 minutes away from my local fire department so they were there quick. By the time they arrive it was clear what was happening so they hit me with the narcan that would pull me out of the od blackout for maybe 20 or so seconds in which I remember telling my dad and the emts what I took and how much. By this point I'm about 4 narcans in from the ambulance alone and another 2 when I get To the hospital. They release me after a few hours of monitoring with a fucking pounding fentanyl headache. The ride home from the hospital with my dad was the most awkward shit I've ever been through; on top of this I was wearing just boxers and I was brought a pair of pants that was my sisters sweatpants. To this date I haven't lived that down yet and my dad still doesn't trust me whatsoever. I suppose what I'm looking for is some affirmation that I'm not alone with this shit.",1517429956.0

But I've never found drugs (except for an MDMA capsule once at a rave like 5 years ago and a bag of coke at that same rave which sucked because I didn't do coke). Anyways, yesterday I'm driving home from work and as I'm exiting onto a ramp to the interstate I see a Michael Kors bag on the shoulder of the road. I immediately pulled over and walk the 20 feet back to get it, and then after hopping back in my car and starting to drive again, about 30 feet down I see two prescription bottles so I pull back over and grab them. Now this was super sketchy in terms of safety because it wasn't even a full shoulder as I was still on the ramp going from one Interstate to the next. But back to the important part, one prescription bottle was gabapentin and it still had the sticker on it with all the patient information, the other bottle didn't have a tag and after Googling that pill imprint I was pleasantly surprised to learn I just found 32 morphine sulfate 30mg!!!! I was able to return the Gabapentin to the owner, who was extremely grateful as she had nerve damage from a botched wrist surgery earlier this year, and unfortunately there was enough information from the stuff left in the Michael Kors bag that I will be returning that to its owner this evening. I was honestly hoping the bag would be empty so I could sell it but it had the contact information in a notebook right inside and I have lost my wallet and had it returned far too many times not to pay back that Karma. But the morphine came at the perfect time as I am both trying to cut down/ quit h right now and due to bills I spent my last $20 on some H that lasted me Monday and tuesday, so I was going to have to go to work today in withdrawals. Instead I have a nice little buzz going and I can start tapering tomorrow. 

Also apparently the reason of the bag was on the side of the road is there was a spree of smash-and-grab car robberies the other night and I'm guessing that's where the thiefs started throwing stuff out of their car that they didn't want. But they were some damn shitty thieves considering they threw out a perfect condition Michael Kors bag and a bottle of morphine.

Edit: just copying a comment I made before I get asked/told something related to this multiple time.  **There were multiple people's stuff stolen, and the 30's had no information on them and she never asked about them. If she would have said anything about missing morphine, or the bottle had identifiable info on it, I would have handed them right over.**

Didn't want to disclose being an addict, but had to. They tried to get a blood sample and it crushed the nurses ego when they couldn't draw a drop from my shitty veins. 





God, I didn't want to tell the doc I was a user, but I gotta tell him I'm downing 1000mg of morphine daily as maintenance. I mean, they will put me under propofol. I admit, I'm looking forward to trying this, but I'm more torn between 'this is unnecessary' and 'if I have symptoms I should get it checked'.




I told the doc and wish I didn't. He was very weird about it, avoided eye contact and his attitude was all like 'why would you care for your health if you're shooting heroin into your veins?' good point, but still - not his job to point out. He didn't say anything and I bet this is 110% my own paranoia and my own uncomfy-Ness with being a junkie.





The real fun started when they wanted a blood sample. The nurse was crushed when she didn't hit at the 5th try. When the other doctor came in I luckily remembered I did a blood screening at my maintenance docs and offered to have the results sent over. Close call. I mean, if he would've looked any closer at my right arm, it would be clear as day *why* my veins are that bad.




This stressed me out majorly. Did any of you experience similar stuff? I hate going to other doctors than my maintenance doc (tho I don't like him either) and disclosing my addiction. Just this look people give you. Like  'oh so you're just pretending to be normal!'.

Join that with a severe depressive disorder and I truly can't live through it. Ended up in a psych ward last time I tried for more than a day. 

I called the methadone clinics in my area and they're full... don't know how to get into a doctors office that will prescribe suboxone. Now I've used and I don't even feel high, just normal. But I'm out of money and the next moment of desperation is only a couple days away... I don't know how this cycle can continue or end with me getting through it either way.

I've read a ton on this but can't find the answers to a few basic questions I have.


* 1) How much water should I dissolve one M/4 4mg hydromorphone with? It seems like the less the better, since I don't want to have to use a whole spray bottle just for one pill. What is the minimum amount I can use, and what is the best method to dissolve it?
* 2) I've read pills don't dissolve as well in water containing salt. I plan on using a saline solution since I'll be spraying this in my nose. Is this an issue?
* 3) Most people say to use an Afrin bottle for this. If I can't find one with a removable cap, is the best way to refill it with my solution to cut a hole, or is there some trick?

Took it for the first time today. I took two pills because I’m on the taller side and muscular and holy shit nothing else compares. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so good. It’s just like everything feels ok. Don’t know how to describe it haha 

My concern is that having seen how easily people get hooked, and how that can ruin ones life, how can I be sure to not get addicted? I want to tell myself I’m strong enough but better men than me have gotten hooked.

I haven't had any withdrawal but no rush at all. I just can't beat this stuff. I assume the Oxycodone is the beads not inside of it.

I first heard about this drug in an anecdote about an anesthesiologist who would do this to himself and got addicted. That it's not a rare occurrence within that profession and actually kind of a trend. No idea how true this is correct me if I'm wrong. 

Also I wanna say I don't wanna die I would never do this without being EXTREMELY careful and with my vitals supervised the entire time. Also it would be for a long time from now. 

I'm kind of romanticizing it not gonna lie. It's a morbid curiosity. Something's wrong with me sigh

I've been addicted to pain killers for about 5 years now. It got really bad this past year. (~100mg a day of whatever pain pill I could get my hands on) In October 2017 I went to rehab for a month. I relapsed a week after I got out. Since then, I've gotten high a few times here and there. I'm not physically addicted, but my mental cravings seem to remain unchanged.

I haven't been getting as high as I want because I just haven't had the money. Smoking weed/stoges has been getting me through the days (via people smoking me out and fronting me sacks). This Monday is payday and I'm preparing to get pretty faded with my first paycheck.

The first time I ever used heroin I let the person who offered to share to shoot me up. I was 17 and he was older than me. He was very eager to get me to try it, despite me saying no a few occasions prior. I was very upset in the moment. He said it would make me feel better. I was in IOP and got drug tested 3 times a week. I would be clean by my next drug test.
It was a very small amount. It took several times, I have very small veins that are hard to get into. it’s always been a problem when I get blood work. They usually do it in my hand, and that’s were it was done. I had snorted a small amount before he shot me up.
I felt little to nothing, at least I thought so, but he said he had missed my vein when he first when in, and was in my muscle, and I didn’t even realize, I felt no pain..  I remember liking that. I got mono when I was younger, and I’ve had chronic pain since, nothing bad enough to be treated for, but I was always achy, my joints hurt, I felt like I was too young to be in this pain. 

I started using not long ago at all... I first tried it in September or October... weekly use turned into twice a week, then daily. The reason I even used at all? I was in IOP for weed because i would get my legal charges dropped... I didn’t realize how uncomfortable I was sober. I just didn’t want to be coherent. I couldn’t handle life like that. Call me weak, I suppose. Years of therapy and medication and yet very little put me at ease or less of a mess. I am only 18 now. I was a messed up kid and I fear I’ll be a messed up adult. I wanted to take back control of my life. And of course, my fiancé plans to stop. That reason alone I will never look back. I will support him endlessly, through the detox and I’ll write to him with he goes to rehab... and we can live a normal life together. By no means sober, but enjoying a blunt or even a benzo occasionally... neither of us can control ourselves when it comes to heroin. It has its grip on us.

Sometime in January I stopped cold turkey. I do not what warrants as a bad addiction, I did not think I was addicted, I still don’t know. My fiancé says I’m in really bad denial. Fair enough. Most likely. You never realize how you look from an outsiders perspective.. I was very clearly on drugs... my parents started to catch on, I quickly dismissed them pleading that I knew nothing, even when they had found a sealed stamped bag in my room... 

I never experienced withdrawals until when I tried to stopI could go around 48 hours without any ill effects.  But this time I went longer than two days. I was hurting. I’ve never felt pain, such bad aches, my bones hurt, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t get comfortable... I was sitting up in my boyfriend’s bed just crying for hours... weed wasn’t helping, Advil didn’t help, NyQuil... I couldn’t cope. I did maybe a small bump or two when I was stopping... like scrapes off a bag or left over on the desk... I didn’t use for maybe a week. Maybe a little longer. I did it, I was still hurting slightly but I did it right ? I wasn’t going to go back. My fiancé however can’t just stop like that.. he needs to go to treatment. But he can’t until he graduates and gets his degree, or else he will lose his credits. So he’s waiting until may. He would ask to borrow money for bundles. He was using in front of me, him at his desk, me in his bed trying to pretend I didn’t hear him snorting. 

All I thought about was heroin. 

So I went back. I am using a lot less and a lot less frequently than I was. I don’t plan on doing this much longer. I woke up in the middle of the night about five days ago. I ordered insulin needles. U-100 0.5cc  30G x 1/2. It was the best selling. Pack of ten. Five dollars. Free shipping.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend, he got very upset. Even threatened to break up with me if I did it. But I do doubt that. I brought it up again today because they came. He got very upset, said whatever fuck it.

And I was selfish. I just wanted to try. I mixed two bags and some water. I usually boof. But I thought it needed to be filtered so I put some cotton in. Pulled it in, tapped it, made sure there was no air bubbles.
Poked myself over and over. Trying to register. No luck. Mostly in my left hand and arm. I switched to a new rig, I thought maybe the needle was too dull now. I Am right handed, but I used my left hand to shoot in my right hand. I registered. I pushed down slowly. It looked like my hand was getting swollen at the injection site, so I stopped. Rubbed it to avoid an abscess. Got another spot, registered, and finished it. I boofed the remaining water. Keep rubbing my hand. Slightly numb, I wonder if I slipped out of the vein. I’m about to get into the hot shower and massage it again, that’s how I was told  to prevent abscesses.

Honestly I didn’t like it. I was scared. It felt wrong. It made me wish I never started using. I felt low.
I don’t think I’ll do it again.
I feel guilty.
And I know it hurt my fiancé.

This shit really brings out the absolute worst in me.

Every other weekend or so (sometimes more, sometimes less) I've had a 30mg roxy.  My rules were:

1. Never on weekdays (unless on vacation).
2. Never when I'm in a bad mood.
3. No more than 3/4 weekends in a row.
4. No more than 2 days in a row.

I also dabbled with Xanax, Klonopin, Dextroamphetamine, Valium, and the like.  But, with those, here and there throughout the week, but in small doses.  I was also a daily weed smoker.

Since I began, things in life got better.  I was happier.  My business improved.  Great relationship.  Yadda yadda.

I woke up one day and decided I was done.  I still have over 100 roxies, bars, and everything else in my safe.  That was a month ago, and I haven't touched since.  I'm not sure if I will or not.  But, in my current time and space, I'm 100% sober, off weed and pills entirely.  I don't miss it.  I have no desires to use ever.  In fact, the thought really turns me off.

Maybe I'll go another year.  Maybe I'll go longer.  Who knows?  BUT, it is possible to use recreationally without diving down under.  Just throwing this out there since all I read since I began was that by now I'd have lost everything.",1517501589.0

After several good batches of Fentanyl, the last one I recieved had some impurity so caustic that vaporizing 4-5mg burned my throat and lungs so bad that they havent been right for 2 days.  If I had snorted a huge line or IV'd I have no idea the consequence, all I know is my throat is red, metallic blood taste, raw, lungs ache, wheezing, and coughing up brown and green junk 2 days after smoking this bullshit.  So be fucking careful with what you *think* you get, because even though last batch was good doesnt mean this one is.  My windpipe is fucked right now from very little smoke and I even washed and recrystallized  what I had and it had no effect to clean it.  The Chinese dont fucking care they just want that sweet RC money/BTC.",1517495216.0
