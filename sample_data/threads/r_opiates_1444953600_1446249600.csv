Most people in my life don't know that I do pills (or if they do, most think I don't do them anymore) so I just need a place to vent about this. 

I've been flat broke this week. I just started a new job, and I'm going to continue being broke until my first paycheque. I used to be a full blown addict, but these days I'm a chipper/binger; however, I still go into withdrawal after a binge, which is what happened recently at the beginning of my brokeness/around the time I started the new job. Normally I would buy some kratom or something to ease off but, like I said, I'm flat broke. 

This whole time I've been sick, fiending, and broke... but trying to somehow excel in my new position. In the past, whenever I had asked my dealer for a spot she would say ""no."" Today that changed. I was SO HAPPY that I was going to finally be well and 100% on my game at work. Well, I get a text from her saying she drove to meet a ""friend"" of mine to drop some oxy off to her, and she left my pills with her too. I had no say in it. 

This friend of mine I've known for years, and actually has the connection to my dealer through me. She has A LOT of issues though, and she lies often; however, at the time I wasn't super worried. 

Called my friend. I say I could come pick them up now, but I have to go to work soon. She says not to worry about it and that she's more than happy to drop them off to me at work (and I said I would toss her a couple Adderol for her trouble). I go to work, end up actually injuring myself there. Now I'm in serious pain, but have to keep working. And then I get a fucking text from her saying that she is sorry but her mom just got into a car accident and she has to go meet her at the hospital. 

Now I'm not cold. If that did happen then I mean, I get it.... I hope her mom is okay. But this girl lies about things all the time. And that was about 8 hours ago... and she's still ""at the hospital"" and won't tell me if her mom is okay/what condition she's in... just sends me very short, vague texts every couple of hours. I feel like a dick to keep texting her in case she is in some serious family crisis right now. 

It's just been such a shitty week, and a shitty day, and all I wanted was a little bit of relief. 

Sorry for the wall of text. TL:DR: Was broke. Dealer spotted. Dropped off the product with a friend who no-showed. I want to cry. 

UPDATE: My friend has elaborated on her story, saying that she is in a town two hours away at a hospital, and that her mom is having emergency surgery. Apparently, her mom was hit by a drunk driver. She says she doesn't know when she will be home. My dealer has been informed of the situation, and has tried getting in touch with my friend (to no avail). I only slept for about an hour and a half last night and I feel like hell; my anxiety is fucking bad right now. p.s. I really appreciate the comments/advice/support. Thanks, guys. ",1444969952.0

I gotta say the dope in AZ is some of the best tar I've ever come across, with the right connects of course. In Cali I usually cop from friends who go to Tijuana to score, at heavenly priced 1/8 zips. When I'm in AZ I'm literally 30 mins away from the border town of Algodones and I know a couple trusty dudes who re up with fire black tar that isn't stepped on. 

But earlier today, my regular dude who hooks me up fat called and said I needed to roll to his pad IMMEDIATELY. Good sign. I get there and he whips out a ping pong ball size chunk of the strangest colored dope I've ever seen. Its blood red and he said the Mexican dealers call it pigeon blood (could they not come up with a cooler name?). 

Homie hooks me up with 1.5 g and let's me try it first since needless to say I was a little skeptical... I mean red heroin? So I get to cooking up a shot and man does it REEK of vinegar. Since I'm all about HR, I added a tiny amount of baking soda and let it fizzle and sit for a few mins. I like saving my veins from acid erosion. Cooked it up, filtered and loaded the rig and its damn near impossible to tell if you're registering cause the red color matches your bloods color, yet bloods a tad darker. 

I gotta tell you guys this, even if you're tar haters or never had it, this dope is some FUEGO. Hardest hitting most euphoric rush I've had in months. And it has some long legs too, been three hours since that .2g shot and I'm still fuzzy warm and noddy as fuck.

Sorry for all that reading, but hey maybe someone will enjoy hearing about this. Its dope I've never encountered and definitely bringing a few grams back to Cali when I leave! Anyone else on here seen this stuff?

It sent my into severe PWD so I took a 8mg suboxone 2 hours afterwards thinking it would overpower the naltrexone. The sub didn't do much at all, presumably because it's binding affinity is weaker than naltrex so it couldn't break through.

Fast forward to now and I've got some dope. Yesterday, the suboxone was rendered infective because of the naltrexone I had taken a few hours before. 
Does that mean I can ignore the bupe's blocking timeframe since it never had a chance to bind to my receptors (bc of naltrexone)? Or did the bupe slide into my receptors after the naltrexone came off, despite originally being inactive?

Essentially, I'm trying to understand if I should follow the blockade timeline of 8mg bupe or of 10mg naltrexone to determine when I can expect this dope to get me high. Cheers!

Most places give u 50% of the value of the card, but I know somewhere that does 60%!!

Anyways, yesterday my boy tells me I have an extra 15 min on lunch. By the time my shift normally ends, all the pawn shops will be closed so this is my ONLY chance.

I rush to WaWa, cop an $80 Best Buy gift card. My usual pawn shop is a half hour away, w/ the my d boy being another half hour away from there. So I try something new and find a shop close to both the dboy AND my job. Perfect. I even set up the deal before I walked into the shop. I wait in line for about ten minutes. (Seemed like an eternity.) once it was my turn, the guy told me I needed the gift card's receipt or I couldn't sell it. FML. I return to work super depressed. The worst part? My boss was gone for a full hour after I got back. There was no way to know, but I had more than enough time to run my mission to completion. 

As we make it thru the rest of work it becomes apparent that we are going to get done early. If I could just leave at 5, I would be able to blast to my normal spot and sell it there. 5:15. I got done work at ducking 5:15. It's okay. Time for Plan B. I return to WaWa, get a receipt for my gift card (it was printed on a piece of computer paper since I got my receipt hours later) and then slide over to the closer pawn shop (the one that turned me down before.) since my receipt was weird looking, they wouldn't take it. I have one last idea. I run over to a check cashing place. They get so far as to scratch that silver bit off my card before realizing that they can't buy it off me either. So now I'm stuck w/ a Best Buy gift card. *heavy sigh*

tl;dr I ran around town all day tryna sell a gift card so I could get well. Ran into one problem after another and now I'm stuck w/ the card.

PS. While this whole thing was going on my dude told me of a wayyy better hustle. Instead of buying a gift card just to sell it, Western Union yrself money. Instead of getting 40%-60%, u just pay a $4.99 fee and can get as much cash off yr credit card as you need.",1444945114.0

He was a good man. He had a habit in the past, but had seemed to be steering away from opiates. This summer he was 'chipping' and occasionally getting high. I was always try to lift him up out of the trenches. Some bad heroin laced with fentanyl has been killing scores of Chicago users. We're not sure if that's what he had. 

I've now lost 2 friends, and almost lost a cousin to opiates. Just know that you are dancing with death when you even decide to make heroin an 'ok' thing to get high on. Sure you enjoy the opiate glow, but you are surely welcoming a killer into your life. You don't think it will be you. You say, ""I just snort it"". ""I only do it occasionally"" ""I'm in control"" 

Who tests your drugs? Please get high on LSD, psilocybin, marijuana, or even prescription pills if you must........don't fuck with street drugs. 

EDIT: I'm sorry for hastily throwing this out there. To clarify, I don't personally take prescription pills. My statement was regarding knowing the purity of the substance you are getting. With psilocybin and LSD, normally you are part of a small community of people that can tell you the results of their use. Mushrooms are not hard to identify when they're in the dried context of purchasing psychedelic mushrooms. LSD should not be taken unless a friend, or trusted source can confirm the effects. 

I don't advocate complete sobriety. I think human civilization has benefited from intoxication for years. It comes down to the user and their own ability to control their limits. Some of these drugs are addicting, and that can happen more for certain people than others. Either way, it's such an abrupt and tragic way to go. He really was a genuine person, and one of the greats. He was an amazing musician and friend of so many people. He would have friends from all walks of life, and even was doing pretty well in his career. It is a sad sight to see, and of course you have to feel bad for the parents.

No, not the withdrawal or anything like that—I've been taking lopes and klonopin so it's been very comfortable. But the klonopin is the problem. I can't remember anything about the last few days— whenever I don't have any I drink and whenenever I don't have any drink I just cry.

I just got into my first fight with my roomate. This was never an issue, I've been using H maybe every day for the few months or so—I've been addicted for just shy of 2 and a half years with the physical addiction coming and going.

Anyways, I'm having my friend support my habit refunded habit until I find a new job and then I will repay him (one thing that my junkie-ass is good at is at repaying things when people front me). I used to hate and it was the worst job on the planet but my friend told me that she brought $60 back in tips last night which means I'd be able to manage my art and dope habit and then throw some coke in with it for the busy nights.

And sorry i fucking hate these kind of points but I'm definitely at a pretty low point (not like depressed fuck peopel) but yeah so some support would be great.

I'm going to have a real conversation with my alcoholic friend where we might cry which should help.

TL;DR daily heroin helps me, i dont knw hw2 kpe w/lif3

SIDENOT÷i feel like I'm coherent but it hasn't fully kicked in yet. Job application form soon.


EDIT: And Ive been purposefully blacking out—4.5+liqour isn't recreational. I literally have no idea as to what happened during the last few days. My friends keep on telling me that I just kinda fell aslepp or someother shit. Like I smoked weed here and there and I just dont know.

And withdrawal plus the shit college at my university has meant that I've only had around curly fries over the last three days.

Just asked my friend to front me 300 while I search around for a job and finish out with the skeleton application.

I am probably going to start with just my city at first, but I want to eventually include the entire country or possibly even the world. While gathering information on programs in the city I live in is realistic, going beyond that might be impossible. However, I still think it's worth a try. I was thinking that I could write a script that crawls existing websites, but there has to be a better way. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can aggregate the most up-to-date information to populate the database with? Naloxone has saved my life in the past and I want to help save the lives of others.

I have read that it's actually the outside of the seeds that is coated with the active drug since the seeds touch the inside of the poppy plant that has the drug in it. Now, would it be ok to take seeds, put them in a coffee maker like I would coffee grounds? Like, put my filter in the coffee machine, put the seeds where I would normally put the coffee, and just turn it on and let it do it's magic? Or, is there a more specific way to make PST? 

Basically, I want to know the CORRECT way and most POTENT way to make Poppy Seed Tea (PST). All comments are very much appreciated.

Also, is Amazon the best place to order seeds from? Or is going to a specific Poppy Seed website the best route to obtain them? I'm not sure which I should do, so I figured you experts who make it all the time would know. I've also heard that some seeds are less potent than others? I would assume it depends on the plant itself, right? 

Anyways, yeahhh, if someone could please tell me the best place to order them from, that would be great. (Read it in Bill Lumbergh's voice, it's funnier).

I want to make PST for the days when I don't have anything to avoid withdrawals. And even when I do have stuff, or the money to go get, I can stretch my stash/wallet by making PST instead of using. Even if I don't get REKT, if it helps with withdrawals, that would be fucking awesome! If it really does help with WDs, then I figure I can make the PST, put it in my thermos, and just drink it all day long while at work! Lol, if this really works, I might have to buy a bigger thermos than what I've currently got. Also, I figure I could drink PST for a week, then use for a week, and go back and forth on a weekly basis.

So my objectives with PST are:

1) Avoid withdrawals.
2) Save money by not having to buy drugs.

Thanks in advance for all the helpful information, friends! I know this is a great community and I will get the help I need, so thank you so much!!

Only the Addict can help himself?,"I've heard and read people say that we cannot help an addict, they can only help themselves.  That unless they have come to the realization that enough is enough, they will only go deeper into their addiction, and any effort to help them will be futile, or 
probably even make things worse.  This reminded me of something that happened a few months ago.

Like most mothers, a woman who seated next to me in a seminar refused to accept this.  She reacted rather inappropriately since the guy who made that same statement wasn't really talking to her.  ""So I'm just supposed to wait? Until he(her son) reaches that turning point?  What about those who died because of their addiction, they never arrived at that turning point did they?  And 
frankly, can we really expect a family not to act?""  She looked as if 
her pain was shattering her bones. She was immediately in tears and her body was shaking. I found myself comforting her right away, the first thing I said...""there's hope."" 

Her only son has been addicted for 4 years, on multiple drugs, refusing help. He's 23 and unemployed,  he blackmails her to pay 
for his drugs with her meager income.  This poor mother has grown afraid of her own son because of his 
violence, he yells at her and slaps her! and she's 64!  

Honestly,  after hearing all these, I wasn't sure how to comfort and reassure her.  I'm a mother myself, but I can't imagine how she must be feeling.  The only thing that popped in my head  was a video I watched days before, saying that addiction is now considered a chronic brain disease, not bad behavior, not a sign of poor willpower or personal weakness. Some people are able to stop their addiction by choice because part of their brain is strong enough to fight the craving.  This is the video: 
http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/insight/2014/10/26/01-mind-control.html.

Addiction being a disease means it can be treated, or at least experts know where it's coming from and where to look in attempt to fix it. Science has uncovered so much about addiction now that treatment today is much more sophisticated than few years ago. Treatment is no longer exclusively determined by the patient's self-motivation.  We just have to make sure that the treatment we are getting are based on the latest research and studies.

As far as I can tell, I was able to restore a bit of hope in her and I felt accomplished.",1445052995.0

AFTER going through the annoying bother of putting in a PICC (peripherally inserted cardiac cathether) line, and post picc-placement nap, I am awakened by one of my doctors examining me (creepy bitch!), and she had accidentally kicked over my bag and found 2 used needles and some crushed remains of morphine pills (which Id been shooting insead of taking PO obviously, can actually feel them when you shoot them) and gave me a concerned speech, AGAIN, even though I'd been up-front and honest about the drug use from the start. I mean, there aren't a whole lot of ways to get endocarditis that are believable.  
So, she revokes my privilege of leaving the floor I'm on to go to the rooftop garden, which is silly--what does she think, I'm having drone-delivered dope to the top of the hospital? I fucking well wish and now I have a business idea hehe. So anyway, Wake Forest doesn't sent drug users home with PICC lines, even though I assured her they are completely useless for that purpose (IMO). Also I'm not sure how making me stay in an assisted living place is going to make it HARDER for HK and ODM (/u/opiumdenmother) and other related parties to sneak me in drugs-in fact, I could probably win dilaudids playing dominoes or some shit in a state facility. So, my other option was to check out AMA (against medical advice) and take home inferior oral antibiotics, which I chose. If shit gets worse, of course I'll carry my ass back to the hospital and check back in, but a nursing home in Davie County (in the middle of the middle of nowhere) just is NOT going to happen.   

So I probably made a stupid decision but if things get bad, it's fixable. I think the infection is clearing well at this point. So, I let them give me one final dose of vancomycin just to use the goddamn PICC line one goddamn time so it didn;t feel completely pointless.  

End result, no damage to heart or lungs, no sepsis,everything mostly ok EXCEPT:  

osteomyelitis on my damn spine, which i've been trying to get a doc to look at forever....for some reason I don't recall it working well for that. Whatever.  what that means though is that my temporary partial paralysis in my right leg might become worse, or at least not get any better.

Oh and they gave me a gaba prescription so that's nice.  

Basically just an update post here. All is well in the narthex to hell that is my pain and overall irritation. Just glad I've got my /u/heroinking to show me that he loves me. It's important. I wish I could have make his birthday better, but I got a chocolate bundt cake from the hospital caf and some fresh strawberries and faked like it was a Black Forest cake. It was quite fashionably faked.

So here's mine. Today I made the thirty minute drive down to Kensington to cop. Went and bought two bars and a bundle. Being the idiot that I am I do my stuff (3 bags) and take a bar. So I'm sitting there chilling in my phone watching YouTube feeling great. About twenty minutes later I pull into a rite aide that's maybe 5 minutes from where I copped. I was planning on getting some snacks and what not. So I guess I fell asleep for about an hour in the parking lot.  

Next thing I wake up to is four philly police knocking on my window saying get out of the car. First cop asks if i needed an ambulance and I declined. The other officers notice my rig and my empty bags sitting on the ground. Stupid I know. So they cuff me up and search the rest of the car without asking.  The officer asks what my story was and I was honest. Said I got in a fight with my dad with made me mad so i decided to come down and cop.    Now these cops must've been on fioot patrol because I saw no UC car no squad car nothing.  So after five minutes of them talking to each other they say here's what we're gonna do.  The cop asks "" I want you to go to this corner (tells me the street) and go buy a couple bags from them. I want the description of the guy you talk to and find out where they keep it"" I said yes sir whatever you want. They said if j do this they will let me go.  

So next thing j know I'm driving a few blocks down the way to where they told me to go. I asked the corner boy for two bags and kind of follow him to where they stashed the dope at. Down this little alleyway they had it hidden underneath a tire.  I get my bags go back to the rite aide where the cops were standing.  I give him the exact info they asked. The officers shake my hand and say I can go on my way.  I said about ten prayers after that and will never go back there again.   
I'm assuming they were rookie cops who wanted nothing but to prove themselves to the department.  Scariest day of my life.  Sorry if I jumped around a bit in still a little shooken up for the whole .

He has an amazing talent for painting a picture with his words and carefully sprinkling back story of his friends right when you're getting to know them and have questions about what makes them tick.

The posts Morbo makes here are excerpts or possibly drafts of sections/chapters for a book he's writing. He was kind enough to give the first installment of his ebook out for free on Amazon for a few days, but you're going to have to fork over $5 for it now, but it's worth every penny, and more! You can find a link to the ebook on his website.

I just wanted to ramble on about Morbo for a bit, just in case some of you didn't know about this amazing member of /r/opiates. Here's to you morbo2000, I've enjoyed your contributions thoroughly and like the rest of us, await your next story like a shivering, shitting, shimmering (from all the sweat, duh) junkie waiting for that damned dboy who said ten minutes forty five minutes ago :-) 

You the man!

I see a pain management doctor for meds to help me manage the pain.  Currently I am taking OP 20 MG oxycontin and 15 MG oxcycodone for breakthrough.

&nbsp;

When I first started going to the doctor and trying to adjust my meds, I kept telling him I was not getting any relief.  He upped the dosage a couple of times from 5s to 10s and then finally to 15s, but I could tell he thought I was trying to get more and more.  So he tells me he wants to do a genetic test on me to see if I am a part of the population whose [CYP2D6 enzyme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2D6) does not metabolize oxycodone very well.

&nbsp;

It turns out that I *am* in the small percentage of the population that is a poor metabolizer.  He tells me this information and basically asks me if I want to change my meds.  So my question is:  what would you change to if you had the choice?  

Please keep in mind that I don't inject nor plan to.  I mostly take my oxycodone orally, but I have been known to insufflate them as well.

&nbsp;

I am not suicidal**. So please spare me the suicide hotline(s) copy pasta and all that jazz. 

**Oh, and the fucking title should say ""I just don't know if I can take it anymore."" Dammit**



Anyway, the point is I'm just so fucking ""empty"" for lack of a better term. I know that opiates can make you feel that way but I feel more like my opiate use (~30-60mg oxy a day usually, insufflated - so nothing too crazy) is more like my trying to self medicate away the emptiness.

 I mentioned spiritual emptiness in the title but I'm agnostic/atheist so I don't mean I'm seeking God/Buddha/whatever. More that I'm just so alone. I seek validation for my life, whatever that means. I'm 32 fucking years old. On again off again addict since about the age of 20 and I'm alone. So very fucking alone. I've never had a real sig. other. The longest I've ever been involved with anyone was for about two weeks with someone who was 20 years older than me whom I met in a rehab (court ordered) when I was about 21. She sprung me from the halfway house the rehab sent me to. She picked me up there on Christmas Eve and I violated my court order by leaving with her (all this happened years ago and has long since been dealt with).  

But now I'm so alone. I honestly sometimes wish I just had someone to cuddle with. Someone to tell me it's gonna be ok. Someone to just give me a hug and say ""fuck, whatever happens happens,"" just so I could feel ok for a little while. 

I have family, both my parents are alive but they're very distant. My mother is overly religious and very passive aggressive. My father is an alcoholic. If I were to ask one of them for a hug they would accuse me of being high. And obviously it's not gonna happen spontaneously. Just not how my family works or ever had worked. 

My father's parents are alive too, and I see them almost every day, but they're oddly distant too. The point here is that I've realized that I can't recall the last time I physically touched another human being outside of a handshake or other incidental contact and I feel like it's starting to break something inside of me. 

Starting to? What am I saying? It starting breaking something inside me when I was 12 and I still haven't found a solution. 

I'm also broke as hell. Have to hustle somehow every day just for one blue. I have a Bachelors Degree for fucks sake. Have been unemployed ever since I got my degree. It's a STEM degree too. Graduated Spring 2013.

What are some ways that can help me get the best results? I know letting it slide is a big deal but like before and sometimes I can get it sliding down the foil nice and clean and other times it doesn't wanna go anywhere.

Another part of of my question is if it's better to keep doing small dabs or should I put a large chunk on it?

I could have dealt with the sickness but it last for two weeks and I couldn't take that much time off work( its seasonal so its only for three months anyway)  and I couldn't afford pills every day.

That's fine I don't mind. However when I started, I could still feel pills. But since being upped in my dosage, I haven't been able to feel shit. Well I can feel it but its like it comes running through my veins, knocks at the door of my brain and then ditches before I get a chance to invite it in so its quite the tease. 

Now I still get high, cause I'll be talkative and nod off and shit, I just don't get the rush.

 Here's the thing, I dont mind not doing the pills cause it'll leave me more cash for videogames and firewood. So that's all fine and dandy, but I would like to feel it just once in awhile. So how can I go about being able to feel my pill.

Would skipping a day of methadone work? I understand it builds up in your system pretty good, but when I do try pills, I try waiting till right before I gt my methadone so that its been close to 24 hours since my last dose, but it doesn't work so good.

I am sick of this shit. Also running out of subs and refuse to sign on at another drug clinic. 

So, 12 days ago I came off a hard skag bender, a truly beautifull few days lost to nodding. So after this, on the next days I took subutex doses: 12, 10, 6, (day off for heroin), 4, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 0.25.

I felt OK until day 1.5 or so. 

Luckily I have a bag of clonazelam (a weeks worth of benzo?) and 8 tabs of weak acid, plus half litre of vodka. So, wish me luck, and also tell me I'm stupid as fuck.

Clucking on acid seems to be helping so far. Reaching some synergy of stpuid drug interactions here.

Today is a beautiful day for most people, with blue skies and just the right amount of breeze blowing...a sunny California day in the the Bay Area..

Except today just wasn't another day...it was the beginning of a series of events that would change so many lives in so many ways...the ball is in motion, the plans have been made and the deal is set. Tonight would be the night that Rico would be introduced to another side of life, and would be allowed entry into the underworld he was so curious about. As he snatches his car keys from the table he glances in the mirror, at 36 he barely recognized himself with the bags under his eyes, badly in need of a shave and shower...but there was no time for such foolishness, today was the day.

He grabs his bag and heads out the door, doing one last check to make sure he brought his pill bottle. A last minute inventory of his everyday carry items assures him he has all he needs for today.

The black honda he picked up recently is in desperate need of some TLC, because it looked like it spent the weekend at Burning Man there was so much dust and dirt on it. He slumps into the seat and pips the key in the ignition and everything comes on in a masterpiece of light emitting diodes, for a split second he feels like he's sitting in KITT, the care from Knight Rider.

With he engine idling, he grabs the pill bottle from his pocket and gives it a few shakes, the coins inside rattle together making the distinct click clack sound that settles his heart...the sound meant that in just a few seconds there would be pure love tasted in the back of his throat, black tar heroin powdered and snorted was his love.

He carefully dumped some powder from the bottle onto the bottles cap, making sure to use his thumb to keep the change from falling out, but allowing the powder to slip through. He grabs his straw and separates the light brown powder into 2 piles in the bottle top, each one disappearing just as quickly as it was established.

He flicks his nostrils with his thumb to make sure every particular of this dust was insufflated into his system. The taste of mannitol mixed with heroin hits the back of his throat and drips slowly, it's a sick pleasure that he enjoys now...

He checked for any messages,  none yet...but he knew that in 12 hours his life would be changed forever. This day has been coming for a long time, and now he will face it head on. No more running, no more hiding....today is the day that he takes back control and do what needs to be done..

As he pulls into the parking lot of the liquor store and scans the cast of characters for a familiar face, but one was not found just yet. He reaches into his jacket pocket and feels that the money is still there...all he was waiting for was the devil...

And so the waiting game begins....

That's why it's so cheap here. We are closer to the source, and we get new batches first.

Whenever batches drop, or level up in quality or form, West Europe follows for sure, and sometimes even America.

**Let's cut to the chase:**

5-6 years now, in Greece we have these dark ashy - black - brown VERY hard rocks of H#3, which break credit cards when trying to make them powder. Quality ranged from 3/10 to 7/10, which is enough for us.

The last 3-4 weeks, a *very different batch arrived*: A very blond, fine powder. The quality is so much better than the previous form, that breaks any scale of comparison. I would classify it as 25/10, just to show how good it is.

People are commenting that ""it's like the old days - real Heroin"". Whenever I open a bag, the whole room smells the wonderful aroma we all crave and adore.

**So, the good news:** Soon, in western europe, you are going to witness a huge quality upgrade. BE CAREFUL, this is real heroin, and it can kill from overdoses. Especially for people like me, who use Benzos as a combo.

**The bad news:** 2 people already died from OD!!! Yes, it was THAT rare in Athens, during these years that we had the black hard rocks, because you needed a lot of this shit + benzos to even achieve a high  close to an overdose. So, when you see that a new batch arrived, more ""grey/pink/tan"", very ""powdery"", and very ""smelly"", be very careful. Try a small bump, because you can always take more later, but never less if the constipated shit hits the fan.

The dark rocks came through the Albanian route, and this ""new"" heroin (*which -ironically- it's like the old, quality one of the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s*) comes from FYROM and Bulgaria.

**tl;dr** --- All in all, westerns will soon experience major quality upgrade, but be careful for overdoses. Epsecially my benzo fiend friends, okay? :)

Greeting from Greece. It is STILL FUCKING SUNNY AND WARM moth$%$%#$er... I need my Autumn to enjoy my Heroin.

They think I'm sober, I've been able to keep my use on the down low by just snorting and picking up while they think I'm still closing down at work. I usually just have my fun after they go to bed, I'll watch tv and they are none the wiser. I always clean up right after I use so if I nod out and they come down it just looks like I fell asleep watching tv. 

Well queue tonight, I was given a rig today and went back to shooting up to preserve funds, plus who the fuck doesn't love that feeling. 

Well like an idiot I decide to prep my shot and shoot up in the living room because they never come down right after they go to bed. And what happens? I nod the fuck out with all my shit all over the place, belt, rig, spoon, ect. 

I get woken up by my mom 20 minutes ago asking why I'm sleeping downstairs. By some grace of junkie Jesus I had turned the tv off and in the total darkness she couldn't see the rig and belt, ect.

I'm just in total shock right now, how could I have gotten so reckless overnight, and how the hell did I get away with it? 

Tldr; live with parents, usually snort, started shooting, fell asleep in living room with rig and equipment scattered about, by some miracle tv was off and she told me to go to bed without seeing anything.

I've been on about 8mg of Suboxone for that time, but I decided to stop taking it cold turkey, and have been off of it for three weeks now. After a year I am finally starting to come back to my old self and remembering who I was before this garbage took over and ruined my life. I don't know what came over me, maybe it was that little voice inside of my head, maybe it was my natural curiosity, but whatever it was, I could NOT stop it.

I found out that my main dealer who went to jail a little while ago is out, and he always came through and delivered the fire Bushwick diesel. He didn't remember who I was since it was so long, and was acting all sketched out. I called him a few times and he said he was coming. He took a while more than usual so I called him again and he said that something came up and he couldn't help me but would call me back in the morning in a few hours. I figured fuck it, he probably thinks I'm a cop or some shit, and that it was meant to be. I gave up on the idea of copping and although I was really pissed that he got me so excited, I was able to fall asleep some how.
For the next few days I thought about copping more than usual, and that I just needed one more time and just wanted to try to slam it and move up to the big leagues. I somehow thought I deserved the high after being clean for so long, and for stopping Suboxone cold turkey, which I was really proud of myself for. I started to get overconfident and began to think that I could finally control myself, because I've been clean for so long, I wasn't about to start going down that dark, cold, miserable road again.

I remembered my college days, when I was hustling the blues and some fire fishscale. I made almost 2grand a week, so smoking 20 blues a day was the norm, and the withdrawals that came with it. I would pick up 100 blues and a oz of christina a week, but I ended up doing most of my blues instead of selling them. I drove 3 hours and paid 12 a pop and flipped em for 30, but near the end I kept them all for myself. It was a good feeling, knowing that I didn't have to rely on anyone but myself to stay well. Inevitably, my connect ran dry one weekend and I was panicking. I could get them for 30-35 a pop but I didn't feel like getting robbed. In the end I paid whatever anyone asked, I knew I could make my money back. But even with my local connect, eventually he dried up and I didn't have anything.

Laying in my bed pathetically, 30lbs lighter than I've ever been, hot and cold at the same time, wishing I could just be put out of my misery, but not having the energy or will to do it. My skin felt like I had 1000 scarabs crawling through it, and my body was so restless that I couldn't escape it. The whole time I had the antidote less than 5 feet away from me, but I would NOT dare entertain the option of taking some subs, because my connect kept telling me that something would come through soon, and I knew the second I took the subs, he would call me saying we were good to go. I went through this cycle more times than I would like to admit, and at the end of it all, I was sick and tired of being sick and tired.

I'll try not to diverge any more, but I feel like you guys don't know me that well yet, and a little background will help you understand my position and where I'm coming from. Blues and dope ruined my life, and here I was a year clean, finally starting to feel like a real human being again, and something came over me, telling me to go back to the very thing that I regretted starting more than anything. Addiction truly is a disease, and I don't think we will ever fully understand it. It really does change the structure of our brains, and we will never quite be the same as before we started. There will always be that monster deep inside of us, just waiting to come back stronger than ever, but it is our job to keep it under control and to not feed it.

After not hearing from my dealer for a week, I finally gave up on the idea of getting high. But lo and behold, the universe had other plans for me. I get a call from a random number that night, and I never pick up numbers that I don't recognize. Something inside of me told me to pick up, and I did. I recognized his voice instantly, it the was the dope man, telling me that he would be around my hood shortly. My heart rate almost doubled, and I started salivating. Even though I knew how bad of a decision I was making, everything in my body told me to say yes. I met him half an hour later and everything went smoothly. Fat and fire bags just like I remembered. I used for two nights and nodded really hard. But I still wanted more, I wanted to feel something more. I was going to finish up the bundle, but momma dukes ended up catching me, and that was a huge debacle. I kept trying to lie my way out of it, but I was cornered, and came clean, promising them I made a mistake and wouldn't do it again. I had to deal with a lot of lectures and almost getting kicked out of my house, understandably so.

I had one bag left, and I had two syringes stashed away for a rainy day. I was so upset with my mom catching me and that fueled my flame to justify the idea of shooting up. I was thinking about it for a week now, and read up on a lot of information on how to do it properly. Last night I mixed up the shot, sucked it up through a little cotton, and had a beautiful concoction all ready to go. I was really nervous and it took me a few hours and a little weed to build up the courage. I took a giant bowl hit, and decided fuck it, it is now or never. I took an alcohol wipe and wiped down the crook of my arm. I popped the orange cap off the needle after practicing the angle a few times, and was ready to go. I put the needle to my arm and said this is it, no turning back now. I'm not scared of needles, but the needle wasn't really going in, and I was pushing pretty hard and got scared. I couldn't get the needle to go in and finally it broke the skin, but it wouldn't go much deeper. I didn't want to dig around too much and bruise my arm up so I decided fuck it and pulled it out. I was disappointed, but at the same time happy that I saved myself from opening pandora's box.

I decided that tonight was the tonight. Tonight I was going in and there was no turning back. I decided to backload that shit into a new syringe and lost a bit in the process. I wasn't gonna make the same mistake as the night before, so I pumped up with some pushups first, and then fashioned a tourniquet using a piece of rope. I knew that things would be right this time, something inside of me told me that. I finally popped the cap off, exposing the sharp, thin, beautiful needle. I put it in the crook of my arm again, and went for broke. The needle broke the skin this time, and I was really excited. I didn't want to go too deep cause I figured the vein was right there, but I kept pulling back and no blood came out. I went deeper and deeper and something told me to stop. I slowly pulled back on the plunger and my eyes lit up when I saw that beautiful plume of red pull up into the syringe. No going back now I thought to myself, and I pulled down on the plunger, letting god's nectar flow into my bloodstream. All in all I was underwhelmed, maybe I should've used more than half a bag I kept telling myself. I knew right then and there that I needed to do it again, to feel it for real this time. Since then its all I've been thinking about, and I already called my connect to meet him tomorrow with money I don't have. I immediately regret my decision, and I know I'm doing the completely wrong thing. I went down the rabbit hole, and now I am going to see how deep it really goes.",1445209850.0

3p974i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3p974i/fuzziness/,7,https://redd.it/3p974i,Shroominup,Fuzziness,"Fuzziness. All I see is blur. I like the fuzziness of having my contacts out in the morning. It reminds me I'm human, broken in a way, not invincible. My head is pounding from the copious amounts of Bulleit Rye and cigarettes I ingested last night. Why did I do that to myself? Oh right, Carlos and Daniel were in town for the first time in months. 

Fuck I miss those guys. They're my best friends. Daniel is hurting right now. His living situation down south with his girlfriend isn't going so well. She pulled a ""bait and switch"" as he so affectionately called it. She told him months ago that her plans were different than she's saying now. He's a fucking hermit. He doesn't want to fucking move to New York. He'd rather live up in the hills 20 miles out of town and live a simple life. He's a simple dude. I love that guy. He's my best friend and this bitch is treating him like shit. Fuck I miss him. 

Carlos is moving to Ohio to be an engineer. That fuck nut. I love him too. But he still owes me like $300 I remember. At least he's making enough money soon to pay me back. 

I'm finally starting to wake up now. I'm glad we got to all laugh, cry, and shoot the shit last night. The fuzziness is pounding in rhythm with my heart beat...as is my headache. I remember vaguely that I finally came clean about my addiction. They didn't even acknowledge it. They just said ""it's cool man, we love you anyway, pass the Bulleit over"" 

Now I'm taking a shit. I feel like a piece of shit. I'm a shit taking a shit. Why have I let myself get to that point? Why didn't I lean on my friends more? My girlfriend knows I use. She keeps me good. 

Fuzziness. 

Finally I finish my shit and stuff the syringe I left full of tar last night for this very reason up my ass. I depress the plunger and let the the sloppy brown water rush into my anal cavity. I slowly pull the plunger out, stand up and wash everything off. I grab my contact case, take the contacts out and I put them in my eyes. 

I remember what Daniel said to me last night. It was one of the only times he showed any emotion while sober. ""Fuck I miss you so much man. I need to come home. I'm dying down there."" 

I open my eyes after blinking a few times. 

Clarity. 

Warmth. 

I miss them. They didn't judge me. Maybe I really will be OK. Maybe I'm not such a piece of shit. No one in my life acts like I am. So maybe these feelings are just from a lack of heroin. 

Then the fuzziness creeps back. Thank God I have another shot. 







So Anywho I know this story isn't great. It's a true story however. I used to write a shit ton (actually got halfway through a novel) but I quit years ago. My girlfriend suggested I start again.

Now since I met him I would notice his other customers copping when I did and after a few times of us coming face to face we met and I have a small circle of people of whom I can talk to and hang with when I'm not really busy. 

This is where things get weird. So I'm hanging out with one dude, let's call him C, and C has recently ran into some possession charges which has made me nervous about dealing with him to an extent. 
We're catching a nod and he's talking in his sleep on my couch. At first I chuckle to myself but as it goes on I pick up on what he's saying. Hes chanting shit in his sleep about our mutual dealer and how he's going to be sorry about shorting him and shit. I let that go, we've all been shorted, until I hear him laugh and say something along the lines of, ""I'm undercover and you're too dumb to see it hee hee.""

I'll be honest I was high and paranoid and in this dudes house alone so I looked in his phone for proof of this. Under a name that looked like any name of any person was a thread of texts relating to doing snitch work. Basics were him giving up every scrap of info he could dish out on dude with the last text asking when he should expect to do another buy.

This shit is crazy. I left everything the way it was and dipped. I didn't want to mention it to dude over the phone when I spoke with him earlier and I haven't had a chance to cop from him to throw him a heads up. 


Just really down about it bc I thought c was a cool guy but the evidence is overwhelming. 
Has anyone been in a situation similar to this?",1445355659.0

I had a long day and didn't expect any relief for lack of funds. Last minute I get $80 out of the blue. Nice. I text my guy, and start driving his way, even before he responds. It's a 30 minute drive, so I'd rather be close. I'm around the corner from him, just sitting at a gas station. No answer yet. Call him. No answer. Smoke a couple cigs. Play on my phone, read the news, smoke a cig. This dude isn't responding. It's not even that late. 45 minutes later, I drive around his spot and his car isn't there. I head to another gas station to. My back is killing me, but it can't be too much longer I hope. I get out of the car to stretch and smoke another. This girl is sitting against the wall, with her bike, and 3 bags scattered about. She says ""Hey, sir?"" I'm expecting some story about how she needs money for the bus. She says ""You wanna buy some dope?"" I'm taken aback. I realized then she was like 45 or older. I was like, ""You have black?"" ""No, the other"" ""G?"" ""Yeah ...I don't even do it, I just found it"" Haha ..yeah right. Her face says otherwise. So, I decline, but tell her I'm looking for black, and she says she knows someone. I'm skeptical, but it's getting later, and I'm not hearing from my guy. I ask her if it's good, and she says she doesn't do it, so she doesn't know. I agree anyway, and she calls someone. We load up her bags, and her bike into my ride, and start driving a bit. We end up at some motel, near a few strip clubs, and I've actually been there before to pickup, so I'm kind of optimistic. Her guy says to come up, so now I have to think ...do I trust her not to run off with my cash? She leaves her bags and bike, and some notebook full of phone numbers, so I'm cool with it. She comes back like 5 minutes later. It looks pretty good so we roll out. She asks me if I know anyone who needs company from a working girl. I decline. I take her around the block and we stop at a liquor store, so I can buy her $6 vodka, and get a few dollars for her trouble. I drop her off a few miles away and get her number in case I need more. She wanted me to call some guy and pretend I know him and try to sell him G, but we realize we aren't even in the right side of town, so luckily I didn't have to get involved with that one.

Anyway, the black is good. I got a new contact and the money didn't walk. Hooray for beach cruiser ridin' hookers.",1445335846.0

   I'm on 8mg sub a day for maintenance and have been for the past 6 months, and recently the past two weeks or so 4mg. However, I've been using here and there for the past month. When I use I always wait 24 hours to snort my dope. My usage looks like this:

Day 1: 4mg sub
Day 2: Dope
Day 3: Dope
Day 4: Dope
Day 5: 4mg sub for the next 5 days, Repeat

   When I do use, I kind of just feel sedated, no euphoria and the usual effects you should expect when using dope. It made me feel so different when I was active in my addiction. I usually buy enough to get me high for 2 or 3 days. So by the 3rd day, the sub is out of my system, so I KNOW I should get the most out of it... but I don't.

Any ideas why this is? The dope is good, same plug I used when I was using daily. Using the same amount too, but I just end up feeling more sedated...Just tired. I'm no longer really depressed, is that a reason why I'm not feeling like I'm supposed to?

Anyone have a similar experience? or knows why this is happening? Thanks guys!",1445320468.0

And it hurts when I tilt my ankle both up or down.

The pain kept getting increasingly worse throughout the day, until it reached the point that it is presently at where I physically can't run, and cant walk without appearing to have some kind of limp. I have found the best limping strategy for me that minimizes pain but it still hurts, sometimes a lot when walking.

It also started appearing like my ankle might be swollen compared to the left one but I couldn't tell until recently where it is a bit swollen around the Achilles' tendon, but the skin isn't red and it otherwise looks normal.

It's starting to be really inconvenient and worry me but there is no reason that I can tell for this to be happening.  The only unhealthy activity I'm involved in is shooting heroin so I don't know what else to do right now except for ask if it might be related to that. Is this something that can happen? I only shoot in my arms and never once in my legs so it can't possibly be an abscess. *Can it?*

My experiences with drugs have taught me to just ride out weird health shit, it almost always gets better on its own. But the swelling has me worried what if it's something from IVing or something. What is going on?

Edit: now the other leg hurts slightly but not nearly as bad as the other one does right now. Now the distance of each step I take is like that of an old man, just throwing my right leg forward because I can only put real weight on the left one. You wouldn't notice the swelling if you didn't have the left one there for comparison but there is definite swelling in the original leg. Am I gonna die?",1445317281.0

Well, I already have my Verizon iphone and a back up government phone and I was signing up for a new one and this dude was like you want a job passing these out?

I said possibly what does it pay? 7 dollars per person I GIVE a FREE phone to. Lol I said no doubt bro. So he gave me a tablet that cost me 50 dollars, 25 from my first 2 checks. All you need to qualify is a food stamp card ( doesn't even need to be active, can literally be 10 years old, as long as you can read the numbers) OR medicaid card AND a state ID. 

It's pretty simple guys think about it, if I sign up 10 people a day ( guy who hired me said it's easy to do 10 ) I get 70 dollars tax free. 


So at the end of the day I came up on a pretty decent easy and legal hustle. Tax free direct deposit every Friday and I work whenever I want, where ever I feel like working. Already made 32 dollars on my 2 minute walk home from the gas station on my block.

I've gained a second mother, a brother and a sister from this terrible thing. I've however lost one of my best friends that i haven't seen personally in almost three years since he came back from rehab a place that I and his family put him in. 

He wants nothing to do with me, and tries me ok for money via text every once in a great. 

The stories, and the life altering things that he claims will happen to him if he doesn't get the money. A part of my lasting little bits of our late teenage years of friendships slowly die every time I offer him to take him back to rehab, and all he wants his fuel for the addiction. 

His mother and brother and sister all share in this bond where he stick together and make sure we stay strong so he doesn't get money from us. We've all been pretty good at that. ""Mom"" as I call her slips sometimes, but she tells me. 

I'm lost, I am writing this knowing I've truly tried almost everything I can do. I've reached out to clients of mine in the healthcare field for guidance. And they all share in the same verbs and serenades to the dark tones and small percentages that come with the likely hood of ever finding my friend in the dark world of this drug.

Whenever his mother calls me, I fear it's of her telling me of the news of the death of my friend Rich.

I've written him letters, filmed a 30 minute video of my passion and begging for him to go to rehab again. I've left him voicemails, I've called the cops on him for acting out towards his mom and stealing from her. I've done it all. He hates me, and knows that I'm the voice of reason in this dark and twisted world of addiction and manipulation. He has some punk ass Doctor that even writes him a script for adderall. It's a web of highs and lows all day long. 

His source of income is the crazy part, it's hard to understand the things this dude does for his fuel. 

So, in an effort to sleep, and an a desperate attempt to beg for the worlds advice. Help me, help me understand how I can try and help.

While I was at my d-boy's house today to pay him my balance and cop a few stamps, he informed me he was checking himself into rehab, along with another one of our buddies who was always at the house. After the first few seconds of frustration of not being able to cop, that quickly subsided and I'm actually genuinely happy for him. I was there when he called the facility to check himself in, and this marks the last person in my town I knew who had a connect. Apparently, even my d-boy's plug is in rehab now as well. As a parting gift, he left me with 2 sub strips so I wouldn't get sick. I wished him luck, and off I went. 
     I'm not going to make any effort whatsoever to find another plug, and I'm extremely excited at the prospect of moving on with my life. I've learned a lot through my heroin use, though. I learned about myself, and more importantly, I learned that opiate users, by and large, aren't the conniving, depraved individuals society portrays them to be. I'm extremely excited at the prospect of getting clean, and although I never poked, heroin was still creating a lot of problems in my life. I'll very likely still be popping in to see what you clowns are up to after I feel comfortable enough to look at the posts without feinding.

Last winter, there was a warmer day. I had this brilliant thought to sleep outside by a river near my house. I settle down, all warm with a great blanket, right? I was blasting music in my ears. This was when I was doing dope daily (snorting). I nodded in and out, and finally just emptied my last 2 bags out onto a small tray, and up my nose it went.

Next thing I know I wake up with no blanket on, half in the icy water, covered in snow, blue-ing fingertips and the most intense shivering I could imagine. I spend a few seconds incredibly confused before I tried to stand up. I was shaking so much I just fell over into more snow, slipping and sliding around in slush. It took 10 minutes of great strength and falling over repeatedly to finally make the (what would have taken less then a minute) to make it back to my warm house. Since I live in rural VT, the light pollution was minimal, everything was pitch black besides my dimly lit house. I got inside, took a warm shower, got my blood flowing normally again, and slept for 11 hours.

I know it's a lame story, but with the cold weather lately, it came back to my mind, and I have noone else to share it with ;)9

The intense confusion and feeling was akin to that one time I swallowed a gram of benedryl/diphenhydramine. I was so fucking shakey!",1445285655.0

3pdbce,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3pdbce/xpost_from_rresearchchemicals_2fma_and_hydrocodone/,7,https://redd.it/3pdbce,Kingofslowmo,(X-POST from r/ResearchChemicals) 2-FMA and Hydrocodone,"So yesterday I woke up at 8:00 AM to get some university work done as I had the day off. I usually take around 50-80MG of hydrocodone on days that I want to study ( I know it's wierd using a downer as a study aid, but I feel like the ADHD I have helps explain that ) and today was no different except I remembered that I had some 2-FMA left over.

I had done this combo many times before in the previous Sundays, and I think it's safe to say it is sort of a habit at this point to wake up on Sunday and take this combination.

**The Full Combo**

*50MG Hydrocodone*

*18MG 2-FMA*

*200MG L-THEANINE*

*100MG CAFFEINE*

The only difference between this day and the days before it is the increase of the dosage of 2-FMA. In the past sundays I had only been taking about 14-15MG as I am extremely sensitive to 2-FMA doses as explained in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/3l04jx/2fma_an_inconclusive_stim/


It's also necessary to let you guys know that I do have somewhat of an opiate tolerance. While I only take Hydrocodone/Oxycodone about 3 days a week ( sometimes only 1 ), I usually always take about 50-80MG and have done so for about 3 years.


**T + 0:00:**
Pop the homemade capsule and 5 Watson 853's. I start to play some counterstrike like I usually do when I'm waiting for a dose to kick in.

**T + 0:40:**
The games close to over at this point and I'm deeply engaged into it when it hits me. It hits me like a bag of bricks man, I am suddenly very very fucked up. It's not uncomfortable though, just very new. I can feel the warm opiates and the speediness of the 2-FMA and Caffeine. 

**T + 1:00:**
I start doing homework like I usually do.

**T + 2:30**
I am extremely nauseas. I've gone outside twice now because I feel like I'm about to throw up. My mouth is watering and I'm shaking so fucking much. I realize I haven't eaten much today ( all I ate was a bowl of wheat cereal or something ). I run in the kitchen, grab a yogurt and start munching while I cook up some pizza. The mouth watering and nausea stops.

*At this point I think I should mention that I've been keeping super hydrated, I naturally drink about 4-6 bottles of water EVERY day, today I was drinking about half of one more every hour than I usually do*

Anyway, with the nausea gone I get back to work.

**T + 5:00:**I have to say, the hyper focus has been insane and the opiates take away that anti social and depressed feeling I usually get from 2-FMA (refer to my first experience post at the top) so I'm feeling pretty good and getting all my work done. At this point in time, I start feeling a little nauseas like I was earlier. I subconsciously know that there is no way I am going to avoid throwing up now. I can feel it, so I run outside and sure enough throw up.

*I know that opiates make some people very nauseas... But fortunate enough for me I have never been made nauseas by opiates alone and feel that this was the cause of the 2-FMA*

**T + 8:00:**Well, I can feel myself returning back to baseline, the hydrocodone warmth is almost gone and there is no more speedy shaky hyper focus feeling from 2-FMA. I'm not nauseas and I managed to get a ton done today.**

I woke up this morning with no headache or hangover, I got out of bed relatively faster than I usually do actually, which was quite nice.

Just wanted to hook you guys up with a nice read :)

**Also I am aware that mixing a research chemical stimulant with a downer such has hydrocodone is a bad combination. I do not recommend ANYONE try this combination as it can be fairly strenuous on the body. I just wanted to share my experience with this sub and let you guys know how its been working out.**

**TL;DR: Hydrocodone and 2-FMA is a great study aid but increase one or the other too much and you wont have a good time.**",1445271724.0

My po called and told me that I dropped dirty and to bring in any prescriptions I may have received in the past week or so. That's the only reason I think I'm safe, is because he called and said opiates rather than heroin/morphine. If I did drop dirty, why would he call to let me know, ya know?

Anyways, I'm going to meet with my po for our weekly visit in about 3 hours and hopefully he doesn't have me locked up right there. My county will lock you up on spot for dropping dirty for opiates because heroin is an epidemic and they don't want us killing ourselves.

Edit: I'm SAFE!!! Just got back from his office. I threw in a question about Vivitrol too. I'm done with opiates for once.

Hi.

I’m not going to tell you my real name for obvious reasons but you can call me Jens. I’m an ex-pat and I came to Estonia to work here a few months ago. I have worked previously in the US, Spain and Norway where I had no problem getting the fix to my little problem, called heroin addiction. I thought cold copping is easy in Estonia as it is in any developed nation but I was soon proved wrong.
I’m going to tell you the story how I cold copped in Tallin.

—

The first time I came to Estonia was for the job interview so I didn’t stay the night and snorted a fat line of Copenhagen’s finest before boarding and as I had hid half a gram in my ass aswell for emergency reasons, I snorted like half before boarding the return flight. The following week I had a few Skype calls vice-versa with my soon-to-be employer and they hired me. Speed up the time a little bit and we are in this chilly July evening. 24 hours before the flight I steered clean of any dope and before boarding I put a 8mg Subutex under my tounge and 9 8mg Subutex’s in my ass for emergency reasons as I wouldn’t be able to survive the next days doing important shit while in withdrawal. Subutex was just my safety line. As soon as the plane landed in Tallin I took a cab from the airport to meet the realtor who gave me the keys to my apartment in downtown Tallinn which I rented via Internet beforehand. I handed the driver a piece of paper where the realtor wrote the address of the apartment and off we went. We were approaching downtown (I think?) when I saw the town was really buzzin’. It was Friday night. Then it hit me, this is the perfect time to go and look for a plug for gear in Tallin. If not today, then when? I had 9 fucking Subutex’s left in my ass and I had to head to work on Monday. I told the cab to stop and asked back the paper with the address to my apartment.

—

I stepped out of the cab somewhere near the Viru roundabout and I headed towards the place where the biggest noise was coming from, the old town. I’m a bit hipster as much as I hate to admit it and all the fuckers in my new workplace who I met while being here on the interview thingy were also dudes rocking mustaches and they were fast to give me recommendations on the place with the finest beer in the old town. But see, the thing is, I don’t give a fuck all about beer.

—

As I already I mentioned (I think?) I have cold copped loads of times before and it has never backfired. So I was going to use the same gameplan as usual. Find some sketchy looking people or some young potheads and move on from there. Entering the Viru street I immediately noticed two females nodding their fucking asses off on something but they looked too scary to approach and didn’t fit my protocol. In about 2-3 minutes I spotted a large crowd of young hip guys and gal’s aged 18-21 in front of some establishment I don’t remember the name of. I approached a dude in a camo-jacket and some skinny jeans and politely introduced myself. The murmur stopped and the crowd’s eyes were locked on me. Not to look too sketchy I swiftly moved on to the subject of drugs. I told them I needed to score weed in hopes of them leading me to someone who is selling BECAUSE, in other countries, like the US or Spain or the UK, they are usually holding something else aswell and if not, can point me in the right direction. To my surprise the dude looked at me for like 3 seconds scoping me out and then proceeded to call his mate over to us. They were speaking something in Estonian for a minute and then the other guy who came over asked how much I want and that he has it on him right now. I am literally thinking, SCORE, when I tell him something along the lines of „Yeah cool mate, I’ll grab 1/8 off you (just to be polite, It would probably sit in my desk drawer for months) and maybe you can hook me up with something else aswell?“ He gets slightly paranoid and starts assuming I’m a cop or whatever and they start mumbling in Estonian again. I notice the situation getting pretty tense and I just tell him that I’m a junkie and I need some dope. Then the other guy started getting mad and asked if I was fucking around with him and that he can give me the dope right there and then.
Turns out, we had REAALLYY fuckin’ different understandings of what ’dope’ means. They didn’t even know what gear is. At that moment I was literally thinking if I should just move on but I still felt I needed to spell it out for them.

„Guys, I don’t need weed, I don’t need MDMA, I don’t need coke or what the fuck do you have for coke here, I need H-E-R-O-I-N.“

…Silence, total silence. The situation was already as awkward as it could get because I was getting looks I had never gotten before doing this kind of shit. I swiftly said that I’ll take his weed but can he atleast point me to the direction where a fucking human being can find some Heroin in this town. They chill out and point me towards Kopli and Balti Station. They said it’s supposed to be really dangerous though and If I don’t speak Russian I shouldn’t go there. I then asked which of the two is safer to begin with and they recommended the Balti Station. One guy had joined the chat and was almost bragging-like that you guys here in Estonia have fuckloads of fire H and that Tallin is supposedly the OD capital of Europe (which I later found out to be true, only for not fucking H overdoses). I felt like I was wasting my time now and we proceeded to a little bit more closed off area so I could buy the eighth off the weed guy out of politeness and get back to what I was doing. As we were parting ways, the dude tells me that old town is infested with heroin junkies and I could probably find few in a very short time but again, he didn’t recommend it. He told me to go check out a place called ’Protest’ where I might be able to grab someone along who knows the area. I offered him 100€ just to show me the ropes himself but he declined and said he had better shit to do.

—

As I stood there, this eighth of weed in my pocket thinking what the fuck just happened. There was a fast food joint called Hesburger next to me with loads of taxi’s standing in line. I hopped in one and said I need to go to some place named ’Protest’. The driver suddenly has a large grin on his face and starts driving. Turns out, this fucking place was like 300 meters from where I boarded the cab. Cool, take your money and fuck off. As soon as I set feet out of the Taxi, HOARDES of hipsters. My eyes were literally getting cancer from the happenings going on before the front door. As you guys are local, you probably know what I’m talking about. A little bit further, I spot two dudes sitting on a bench. They were definitely 10-15 years older than the crowd I encountered in oldtown. The guys were sharing a beer and smoking a J. I was already so fed up with this shit that I just point blank told them, that if they can point me in the right direction where to get some H, I’ll give them the eighth of weed I just bought for free and 60€ on tops. To get rid of any suspicion I whipped the mini-grip bags out almost instantly and held my hand out. The dude who was smoking on the J started laughing and then looking at me with real sad puppy-like eyes, then laughing again. Then I couldn’t believe the sentence he uttered out of his mouth.


—


„Bruh, uh, *giggles*, I’m not into that shit but I can tell you for a fact that we don’t have Heroin since 2002.“



My brain literally couldn’t comprehend what he said at that moment. I tried to wrap my brain around that sentence but came up short every single time. It was like it shut itself down. After the beer drinking guy saw the reaction on my face he added:


„Yeahh, uhh, but we have this thing called fentanyl.“



Fentanyl? What do they mean? Like trans-dermal patches? You guys have addicts shooting up the gooey-like substance from trans-dermals? No wonder you guys have the highest death toll of EU but it’s not probably from overdoses but injecting all kinds of fillers in your veins which come extracting the fentanyl from the patch. The dude was a little bit confused at first but then tried to explain the situation in more details and I was slowly getting the grasp on what is really happening here. He told me that in one of the previous years, the police caught a whole 0.4 grams of Heroin PER YEAR, PER FUCKIN’ 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE. I was astonished. Thats LESS than what I rail in ONE day! The dude was explaining to me that Tallin doesn’t have stamps or anything like that, it’s only powder wrapped in aluminum foil and you got to go through some really shady characters to obtain the substance. The dude looked like he knew what he was talking about so I took his word for it but I wouldn’t stop pressuring him even though I knew the substance I would be dealing with is in a whole another league. He told me he can bell a acquitance who sells Speed (first country I ever been to where this is still alive, usually it’s meth/crack everywhere) and MIGHT know someone who can help me with my quest for a fix. They blabber over the phone and I could pick up some instant rise in the tone of their conversation when he mentioned why does he need his help for. He probably had the eighth and 60€ I promised him in mind so he kept talking to him. Finally, he put away the call and told me that someone will call him back. I hoped to god it wouldn’t take long because I was getting really fed up. But to be honest, the awe-inducing stories he told me about the substance called trimethylfentanyl intrigued me even more. I lighted up a cigarette and chit-chatted to the guys about everyday life when suddenly the dudes phone rings. The conversation is pretty short and straight forward although I can’t understand shit. He tells me I need to go to Balti Jam, infront of the Schnell hotel and wait for a girl to show up. It was safe to assume that the girl won’t be holding and needs to be taken care of. It’s the same, doesn’t matter where you are, addicts are addicts. He calls up a Taxi for me and vaguely brings up the subject of the eighth of weed and the 60 euros. I asked him to come along, he said he is not in the mood for this kind of trip (I pretty soon found out what that meant) and he’d rather not. Well, I hand the guy the stash and the money just to get some + points or karma from the „dope gods“ (mind of an addict) and wait for the taxi. He also asks for my phone real quick to put the number in there what I should be calling when I arrive at the hotel. The cab pulls up and I sit in and tell the driver where we need to go.


—


In like 5 minutes we park infront of the what looks to be the Schnell hotel and I tell the driver to keep the engine running and pull out the phone. I bell this number. At that moment I had literally no idea we were at the place I was recommended to go to earlier, the Balti Jam. The phone keeps ringing and just when I’m about to hang up a really cracked out female voice answers. The first 45 seconds she doesn’t know what the fuck I am talking about and is probably cussing at me in Russian. I calmly repeat the words „friend“; „Schnell hotell“; „taxi“ over and over ’n hope for the best. Finally I sense some recognition in her voice although I had no fucking idea what she was saying but it ended in something that sounded „minutes“ so I just said OK and ended the call. We sit there like maybe ten-fifteen minutes and the cab driver is smoking a ciggy outside while a female with a beat-up face and some missing teeth approaches the Taxi. It’s her, no doubt. She sits in, starts talking in Russian, I nod and slowly and politely as possible swivel away from the middle of the back seat so I would seat as far as possible from her. She tells something to the taxi driver and then the driver looks onto me, I nod again. We start moving. Me, an Estonian cabdriver and an absolutely cracked-the-fuck-out (or maybe withdrawals, I can’t tell) Russian girl. She is talking to me all the time and it all sounds like some jibberish and all the time I’m like „Yeah“; „Uh, uh“, „Da“ etc. She starts getting a little bit mad which I pick up from the frequency of „cyka blyats“ in her sentences in one minute frame (Yes I have worked alongside Russians before and know what it means, kinda). Then, the taxi driver jumps into the conversation and translates her shit to me. „She’s asking how many do you need and can she keep 20€?“ Cool dude! The taxi driver knows his shit. This doesn’t feel so alienating after all. Maybe I should have looked up a cheap taxi at the first place and started my search for gear there but I am already in way too deep to change the gameplan. I tell the driver that I wan’t 10 doses, which if it was H would be a gram but I had no fucking idea what she was going to bring me. Again, some Russian jibberish from the girl and the taxi driver jumps in: „She says she needs 120€, you should probably ask her to leave her purse and belongings in the taxi. If you want, I can tell her you said so.“ I was like, yeah, do it. The reaction is fuckloads of „cyka blyats“ again but she takes my money and takes her bag off her shoulders as we pull up to some really shady houses. I can read an address sign on one of them „Kopli something“. Cool. So this is the place. She leaves and me and the cab driver go for a cig outside. I ask him if it’s really that dangerous to be doing this alone and he said pretty much, yeah. Turns out, his brother is an addict and also addicted to the same stuff so I felt kinda bad for the guy for the whole ordeal and made sure to keep in mind to tip him generously. He explains to me, that this really is the overdose capital of EU and I should be really careful with the stuff and also the people I would be dealing with. I take his number just in case I need a cool driver to cold cop again in the near future, although feel bad doing it.

From somewhere between the shacks, the girls pink jacket starts to appear from the shadows and she sits in the car, insisting that we drive to a gas station so she can shoot herself up fast and then take her back to town. We start driving again and the girl slides 10 little aluminum-foil wraps into my hand. Soon we pull up at a Statoil and she goes in to do whatever she has to do. Meanwhile I am contemplating in my head about which ROA should I use for the substance. Given that I’ve taken 8mg of Subutex about 12 hours ago I would need alot to break through (because of the super-strong hold buprenorphine has on your receptors) the bupe. I think it’s best to do an allergy test first and snort one dose and then proceed to other ROA-s. The girl returns, all fucked up. Her speech is so slurred I couldn’t even catch a clear „cyka blyat“ from her mouth. Then I remember the girls on Viru street who I saw a few hours earlier. Yeah. Probably the same stuff. We are driving again, I don’t even know where. Russian girl’s directions. Right about now I start thinking about what the fuck I am really doing. I came off my flight, haven’t even checked „home“ yet and wen’t straight to dope hunting and am proceeding to consume something which has supposedly ended so many lives here. The meter on the taxi shows 22 something and I hand the driver a 50 eventhough the ride is not over and politely ask him to ask the girl if she has any clean rigs. She did. She handed me some really wierd ass looking rigs unlike I’ve ever seen before. Thankfully they were all in plastic wrapping and new. I also ask for some filters and get a response she doesn’t even know what the fuck I am talking about. I guess they don’t hand out filters at the exchange here if they even have one. We pull up near the oldtown somewhere and the girl gets out and yells something at me as the door closes. „If you need some more, call me“ translation (c) cab driver. Me and the cabby both exhale from relief quietly but audible enough for each other to hear. I found that pretty funny. I finally hand the driver the little paper from my realtor with my address and we start driving there. At this moment I am really wishing I didn’t get burned or something like that, with gear I would atleast know how it should look at and smell like. With this I’ve got no idea and I’ve already blown upwards of 250€ to the air.
We pull up to this apartment building not far from the hotel where I met the chick (Schnell hotel) and I hand the cab driver another 20, shake his hand and tell him hes a good guy and leave. I proceed to open the door to the elevators and go all the way up to the last floor. I open the door, throw my backpack (all my belongings I took with me) in the corner.

—

I lay the wraps with the rigs on the kitchen table and run to the shower cabin. I forgot. I still have 9 8mg Subutex’s hid up my asshole. I try to pull the string gently (which I left hanging out my chocolate starfish just a bit) so it doesn’t break and slowly get the balloon out of my asshole. I close the tap on the sink, fill it with water and put the balloon floating in there. I couldn’t be fucked doing a proper clean-up on that at the moment so I just washed my asshole and the shower cabin with the water and ran to the kitchen with a towel around my waist. When I opened the first wrap, I felt like I got grossly parred. There wasn’t even a ¼ of 0.1 gram dose. I proceed to snort the whole powder up my nose and literally feel nothing. I decide to wait for about 15 minutes and see what happens. Nothing. Not even a slightest mood lift. I am getting really agitated and thinking I got burned so I unpack a rig and mix up a solution with 2 doses and 50cc of water, from habit, I also add few drops of lemon juice and heat up the solution. I get a yellow-brown like transparent solution in the rig and without doubting myself for a second, proceed to shoot that shit up my elbow crook vein (despite not having shot up for 2 months). Oh… Ohh… YEAH… and now the rush is getting too strong even for my taste. Mainlining two doses measuring up a measly 0.035g hit through the buprenorphine like a fucking freight train. I was pulling the syringe out of my vein and the blood was literally squirting out of the vein (never happened to me before and definitely didn’t hit an artery) on to the refrigerator and oven. I was slowly fading into unconsciousness and when I woke up two hours later I honestly thought I had borderline OD-d. I threw away the rigs for safety reasons and proceeded to take out my macbook from my backpage and read up a bit on the substance called 3-methylfentanyl. Turns out, I am dealing with something as potent as 6000 times morphine (FYI, Heroin is 2-4x as potent).
I also read that it can be smoked aswell for an even faster but safer onset because you can inhale smaller amounts of the drugs at a time. Basically, this whole cold cop experience was one of the wierdest yet, or maybe the scariest due to the uber potent nature of the opioid 3-methylfentanyl. Barcelona and Atlanta ghettos were also pretty scary but like a whole different way. I ended up copping a few times a month from the girl and a few new numbers I’ve acquired and finished off the batch of wraps I got in like 2 days (ROA smoking). The way I mainly got my gear now is I called up my buddy in Copenhagen, I hopped on a flight and met my buddy in Kastrup. Shoved 10 grams of gear up in my ass and took a flight back to Tallin. I had to do this like 2-3 times a month. Pretty excruciating and if I’m honest, I was already looking for another more stable job which wouldn’t throw me around different cities around the world few weeks after starting here. I couldn’t encounter another clusterfuck like I did in Estonia again so I actively sought work in my hometown to escape this place and I am happy to say, I am working in Denmark again for the third week and railing fine Heroin #4 straight from the middle-east daily. Life couldn’t be better. Please do something for your addicts and fix your situation. I have never in my life seen addicts in such bad shape before, although I haven’t been to Russia (hint: Krokodil). Not even the African-American dope users in the US ghettos are in so bad condition (crackheads yes, dopeheads no). I can’t imagine any other developed nation enduring something like this for so long and doing literally nothing.

Thanks for reading, and please, fix your shit Estonia.

TL;DR - dude goes cold copping in developed EU state, finds out no heroin since 2002, only 3-methylfentanyl. 6000 times as potent as morphine and Estonia has the most OD's per million people in the world. nothing being done.

So I picked up a few lines the other night from a new guy who has been pretty straight with me so far. Sacks of shrooms always over in weight, same for bud, so far so good. 


Anyway, I buy it and the color checks out (purple, qualitest right?) as well as smell. The only thing is, when I go to pour it, it doesn't sink. So I stop halfway and put it on a flat surface so as no to agitate the bottle pouring as slowly as possible, and it barely sunk.

From my understanding lean is supposed to go straight to the bottom, and this did not although it did give me the expected effects though I imagine a bit different than codeine would feel without promethazine and that bit of alcohol. At least to me. Had me feeling good although I'd prefer oxycodone since it's 10 times better and less than half the price even at 20 per oz.

My question is why did it not sink? I've thought about it the whole day and I can't think of anything other than it was bunk syrup, but it gave me the desired effects.",1445390505.0

There wasn't enough coke in the world to sober us up. I ate around 8mg of xanax, maybe more that I forgot about. I didn't drink, but I was feeling fanfuckingtastic. Well, this morning was another story.
        
   

    
     
     
**Part I**

I wake up under the coffee table, which made sense because my bag was under the coffee table. I'm imagining I needed something and couldn't quite do it and fucking gave up. Oh well. Now, as I'm realizing that I'm under this damn coffee table, I hear mexican number 1 freaking the fuck out, like, spider screaming type shit. So I crawl out from underneath and go investigate with mexican number 2 who had also heard this commotion. We walk into a spare bedroom to find mexican number 1 standing on the bed with this strange shaped bulge underneath his boxers. My brain was NOT processing anything still, but boy did it when this guy whipped down his pants. He had a fucking halloween mask, full blown orange hair, white face, serial killer mask, taped to his junk as like a jock strap. So now I have this almost naked mexican screaming in fucking Spanish that I canNOT understand with a creepy mask staring at me from his crotch. Mexican number 2 does NOTHING to help and literally starts laughing. He couldn't breath. My first thought was, *I am not high enough to deal with this, yet.* 

After 20 minutes or so, I'm finally not hating my life so I decided to check up on these two guys. I mean, this guy had duct tape on his asscheeks. It couldn't be going well. Well, I was wrong. It was worse. Apparently Mexican number 1 really had to piss and didn't want to rip skin so he tried to pee out of the small hole in the mask while standing over the toilet. Why? Because fucking mexican number 2 thought it was a good idea. Did. Not. Work. He's now covered in piss as well as having a mask over his dick, and tape on his very hairy ass. I watch in horror as this guy is cleaning himself up with a towel. Finally, mexican number 1 had the grand idea to google this shit. Goo-b-whateveritscalled it was. So me and mexican number 2 hop in the car, at 9 in the fucking morning to go to the store to get some of this shit. Took us fucking forever. 

I didn't see the flaw in the plan. We get back, and mexicans 3-9 were up. Along with the 4 chicks who had stayed. So we have 14 fucking people awake in this house, all trying to give this guy suggestions and help him rip tape off his ass. Mexican number 2 declares we have the solution and everyone wants to watch. I go to hand mexican number 2 the bottle, and he looks me dead in the face and says ""Oh hell no."" Are you fucking kidding me? I HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS FUCKING GUY IS. I'VE MET HIM LITERALLY 3 TIMES. ALL 3 TIMES I WAS BOMBED. Finally, after MUCH arguing with OTHER GIRLS I resign to the fact that I'm gonna remove duct tape off a strangers ass today. Took me 30 minutes and I heard a LOT of new spanish swear words. But, his ass is now kinda waxed, and tape free. Hint: don't duct tape body parts. 
   

    
     
    
   
**Part II**

After the duct tape incident, me and my guy go on our runs. We get gas around 1pm, stop by the court house of his homies arraignment at 2pm (30 minutes away from where we were at last night). Well, here in the good ol' midwest, we can't take our cell phones inside. No electronics. So NEITHER of us had any form of communication for 2 hours. Whatever. I didn't care and either did he. We were purely enjoying watching other dumbasses get in trouble. He ends up posting this guys bond (which we didn't plan on doing, but it was only 500 bucks cash only) and head out. I have 32 missed calls. He has 54. FIFTY FUCKING FOUR missed calls in 2 hours. Fuck. This can't be good. 

Turns out, one of the guys we were partying with last night won't answer his phone, and NO ONE can find him. His GF called freaking out and since they've been having issues with some other guys in town, everyone was on edge. Mind you, it's 4pm. Maybe 5 by this point. We're on our way back to town when one of the guys calls me again. 

""Yo, we found Angel. Can you pick him up at XXth street?""

*""uhh, sure. What the fuck was he doing there?""*

""No clue, he woke up there with paint.""

Great. This fucker went out boosting paint? Cool. Gotta love benzos. Me and the other guy are having a debate about WHY he stole the paint as we pull up to where he's at. He didn't steal the fucking paint. He WAS the paint. This fucking guy was COVERED in this red, orange, and brown spray paint. Like war-paint style covered. He slowly creeps out from underneath this bridge like a fucking troll and sheepishly grins.. After I finally collect myself from this picturesque moment, I ask the begging question. What. The. Fuck. His explanation? 

""I don't know chica. I don't eat benzos very often.""

*""How many did you eat?""*

""7.""

Fuck. Me. This kid ate 14mg of xanax with like,  TEN different types of liquor. He said the last thing he remembers is walking to the gas station at like 7pm. He left our place at 2am. So between 2am, and 3pm, he has NO idea what happened. Who the fuck blacks out on benzos for 12 fucking hours? He said he remembers he puked a lot. But he couldn't find any when he woke up. So he was walking around downtown, puking, covered in spray paint, and then decided to pass out underneath a sketchy ass bridge. 

TL;DR--- Duct tape is for ducts. Paint is for houses.

I'm not sure what kind of test it will be. I will have hubby's clean urine to do a substitution. I don't have much experience/knowledge about saliva tests, I will have at least 24 hours off weed and dope by tomorrow AM, I am using hydromorphone to keep from W/D. I  doubt they will test me at the interview so I should have more time ""clean"" once it happens if I get one/both jobs. So basically I need to know if they test for dilaudid typically and I'd just like to hear some stories of people passing and how they did it (or failing and why they think they failed). Please cross your fingers for me guys! I'm a huge animal lover and one job is as a vet assistant and the other is at the local no-kill shelter.

UPDATE: Both job interviews went swimmingly! They are both having me come in to do a working interview. I go for the vet assistant job tomorrow at 8:30, the working interview for the shelter is Friday at 7:30. Luckily I found there is NO drug test for the shelter job, and they told me that the working interview was just a formality and mostly to be sure I will be comfortable with all duties. Even though the shelter pays more, I am hoping to get the vet assistant job. Thanks for all the advice everyone! ",1445380914.0

TO;DR: $40 short on rent. With no other options I'm pawning my lap top. $100 is the minimum the shop will loan. Originally going to just save the leftover money but now wondering if I should buy a G and pay it all back out of my next pay. Thoughts?

Basically my country has had over 9 working days of public holidays this month. I'm a teacher and don't get paid for those holidays. As such my monthly pay was considerably smaller than usual. I've had some help from my family but I also got an unexpected bill so I'm $40 short on rent this month. I feel bad asking my folks for more money as they have been so generous already so I've decided to pawn my laptop temporally. The minimum the shop will loan is $100 so my original plan was only spend $50 and keep the rest to make paying back the loan easier.

Now to the relevant part. My next pay will be enough to pay back the loan and have enough money to pay my expenses plus buy dope for the month. And I am running low at the moment. Sooo... I was considering just buying the dope straight after I get the loan and then paying the whole thing out of next months pay. Is this a bad idea? Is there a chance I might fall into the habit of pawning my shit to get high earlier every month? I'm a chipper at the moment and trying to avoid any actions that may accelerate my addiction.

If you read this far you are a legend. Thanks.",1445529084.0
3ps60d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3ps60d/been_a_tough_couple_of_months/,19,https://redd.it/3ps60d,Highfire2,Been a tough couple of months !,"So finally got a crop down 😍 It's been a long time coming ! I had to take down my set up that I won't go in to here . But I found someone wanting to grow . So gave them my setup to get the ball rolling on a 50/50 deal . Got it all chopped down on Tuesday night and had 4 people doing it and took us about 6 hours to get it all done and dam ! There's a shit ton of weed there ! Probably the best crop that tent has had in it and it's only 1.2m by 1.2m by 2m high and there at least 20 Oz there easily though it depends how dense the buds are and how it dries . Though the small bits I've force dried seem to have kept their weight well .

 So I phone up my main guy asking if he'd be interested in doing a swap . Though he informs me he's stopped doing half Gz ,tenner bags etc and is only doing weights now eighths ,quarters etc . I tell him I've got some good weed here though it's a bit damp but will give him a good deal 6g of wet weed for a half gram of #3 heroin which he agrees to no problem . So weigh out 6 grams of weed and hop on my push bike for the 2 and a half ,three mile journey . Get there and give the door a chap and shout through who it is like he told me to do w hen I was on the phone to him. . Tells me to come in and if I wanted a cuppa and asks I I want to sit for half an hour . Which is a little odd as he's normally done in seconds and does everything at the door basically . But maybe he was just abit lonely as the amount of traffic coming to his door has dramatically dropped since he's started doing weight .

   So I ask him for a bit of foil and stick abit on . The H was alright ran alright and got a good few lines from the amount I put on probably about 0.15g and definetly did the trick as I felt the H slowly surround me in its warm blanket of energy and confidence (talkative) etc . So we shoot the shit and talk the usual high talk . He says he'll just leave the weed to dry out properly as he had just bought a bit the night before and also had a decent sized lump of solid (hash) . Once it's properly dry he'll probably lose a couple of grams and will probably get about 4 grams or there abouts for the half gram of heroin which where I live has a street value of £20 . 
             He gets ready to go to his moms for his dinner and I Finnish of my cuppa and wait till he's ready and get him out . 
  Start pedalling home and thank Christ the wind is on my back now as it was smack dab in my face all the way into town and defenetly made it harder to cycle as the wind is pretty strong today . So the way home was much easier today as the return journey is basically all up hill which is a bummer especially when you have a bit of H in your pocket and you can't do it till youre home . 

                    I get home stick on the kettle prep a coffee and head up the stairs and get my IV. stuff set up make my coffee then get my shot prepped . I've started using the micro filter that is built into the caps of the syringes and it does an absolute perfect job of it and your hit is crystal clear . And is well worth it even though you don't get left with a filter that you can ""wash"" and get a pretty decent hit of them if you have enough . Plus I would always leave a soggy filter maybe 10/20 units and would save these for the end of the night if I knew I had something to wake up to or keep the filters for the morning .

                      The hit was pretty good a nice rush . I only put in half at first as I've not had a charge since last Thursday so wasn't sure of my tolerance even though I'd taken Done ,dhiydracodiene etc every day didn't want to push it to far just incase . So I hope everyone is doing great today and may JJ or just the Universe smile apon you with good fortune ! Happy nods peeps !

I have been taking about 100 to 120 mg per day for at least a year. I have quit four times in the past 12 years. The first time cold turkey and the last three times using ibogaine. When not using I feel lifeless. No energy or motivation. Even when I'm using I am quite fatigued all the time, especially in the mornings. I want to quit and have heavily researched all options. I read all the forums about different medicines, supplements, techniques etc. to avoid withdrawal and to deal with post acute withdrawal syndrome. I save my research, or at least what seems to be the most pertinent and useful information, in a summary I prepared. After hundreds of hours of research I have concluded there is no good option for me. I'm certain I could quit again. I have some ibogaine. Alternatively, I could use the loperamide method, high-dose vitamin C, or high-dose gabapentin, and of course clonidine. But how do I find life again? The life I have now is at least tolerable. But it is becoming less so due to guilt because I know what I'm doing is wrong. I don't know why I'm writing this. I suppose I just need to spill my guts to someone. I know the day will come when I will be forced to quit, but I would prefer to be on my terms and by choice. I keep thinking there must be some ""secret"" cure to this addiction that I've yet to find through my hundreds of hours of research. Some pill that will give me energy and motivation after I quit. Wish I could go back 20 years with the knowledge I have now. Wouldn't we all like that. A good day to all.

So remember how yesterday we had the huge issue of a Halloween mask and the Xanax warrior? Well we have another issue. And no one found out until about 20 minutes ago. 

We're sitting down getting ready to eat some BOMBASSFUCKING chirritos (I think? Idk. They're supposed to be good.) Now there's like 7 of us here right now and many of them are stoned. So muchie heaven man. Everyone is in the kitchen and dining room trying to get salt pepper the works and shit. Bumping elbows and ass cheeks. It's packed. Finally one of the guys sits down and started SMASHING this food. We start to do the same. Suddenly I realized something tasted weird. But, I'm not really knowledgeable on Mexican food so I thought it was me. No. Everyone is freaking out. Someone's food is way too spicy. Someone's meat tastes weird. Shits over seasoned, under seasoned. My girl Yav was the one who noticed. 

""This is fucking sugar."" She was holding the salt shaker. I go and investigate. Yup fucking sugar. Wait, why is my younger numb? Wtf is going on? All hell broke loose. Everyone went back to the kitchen to figure out what had been fucked with. 

Someone switched ALL the spices. Like, out of their fucking containers, into other ones. 

We have identified the following:

Oregano- cat nip

Salt- sugar

Sugar- with coke as well. 

Pepper- this spicey ass shit I don't want to think about

Baking soda- flour

Confectioners Sugar- BABY FORMULA (didn't experience this one thank god.)

Woichester sauce- soy sauce (wtf?!?! Whyyy?)

Seasoning salt- cayanne pepper (I think? Also spicey)

Ketchup- now has a top layer of hot sauce

And we probably are missing more... So now me and Yav are on our way to a store to restock this kitchen. God help us. I'm SO afraid we missed something and we're about to get a terrifying surprise.

I know other people get this, I've read several threads on it, soooo... help?

It doesn't always happen. I thought it only happened in extreme situations, but it's been coming in and out during the last few days just from a normal (day-time/work from home) amount of tar smoking.

I've got an important meeting today and, of course, my eye went wonky on me this morning! I've taken a few hour-long naps and it hasn't ""reset"" (usually does). I've never had luck just focusing on things for a long time like I've read other people do - but I don't know any specific techniques - do you? I have also tried covering the strong eye to let the weak one wake up - still nothing.

Anyone have a quick fix? I really doubt there is one, but I'm grabbing at straws here. Even if most people don't notice the eye, it bugs me out enough that I can't focus. Help!

I'm prescribed 75mcg/hr fentanyl patches every two days and 90mg OC IR/day. I haven't had an increase in 8 months for my OC's out of the 14 months I've been prescribed. I would snort my OC's for faster pain relief and some euphoria, but I no longer get any euphoria from it. I wear my patches as prescribe, but think it's a large factor to my tolerance.



I've been off fentanyl for 9 days and all  opiates for 6. I decided to use clear for the 3 days coming off fentanyl and 2 days of total WD's, which really helped at the time, but made me consider going to the ER for severe dehydration once I came down during the sickness phase of Opi WD's. Going into opiate WD's malnourished and sleep deprived from 5 days of shooting crystal is probably the worse advice I could give anyone, but it was fun until then.



So right now I have 5 more days until my script is ready, I can hardly move from WD's and I really want to get high. I'm not going to buy any opiates until then, since my doctors apparently out of the office, so I should just continue my detox. My friend is buying more clear in 2 days, so I'm probably going to binge again despite not being able to hold a needle steady during WD's.

The consensus here seems to be that interventions and giving an ultimatum to an addict will push them away and make them ""spiral deeper"" and exacerbate their isolation, depression and self loathing.  People also seem to agree that addicts won't get clean until they want to, and that coercing them does not work.

I agree with that, and it describes me to a T.

Something to consider, that I have not seen mentioned and have been thinking about:

The intervention is *not all about the addict*.  The addicted person is putting themselves through hell, and is also dragging all of the people that care about them through it too.  Interventions and ultimatums give the ""innocent bystanders"" a chance to offer help however they can, and then cut the addict out of their life if things do not change.

I think that addicts get so wrapped up in themselves and their addiction and self-loathing it's easy to make everything all about us.  Keep in mind that if we don't want to get help, our friends and family might need the intervention as much as we do to move on.",1445595687.0

I have quite a few close friends that know about my use in the past, but since I've started up again I'm trying to keep it on the down low, although it's hard hiding when you're in the toilet for 20 minutes trying to shit, or when you feel like shit on off days, trying to act normal when you're even a little sick. I find it more hassle than it's worth if they don't use, constantly trying to convince you to get off, plus the stigma is pretty shitty.

Poppy Pod Tea - Good luck finding affordable poppy pod tea. These days pods are expensive as fuck, so most people interested in an opiate tea use seeds. But still, its an option, and one I used almost a decade ago.
Unlike pills, where there's only one opiate present, with pods you're getting a random combination of every opiate present in the pods. The big ones are morphine, thebaine, codeine, but there's a bunch of others and they all contribute to the unique feel of the tea.

And, yeah, that feel is defined by a very, very heavy body high. Oral morphine has a ""heavy-body"" type effect, but pod tea has that taken to extremes. Yes, there's euphoria, but the whole effect is very creeping. Personally I found myself stuck on the couch, somewhere between a nod and the feeling of being made of lead.

Oh, yeah, then there's a bonus once you quit! If you're unlucky enough to have made a habit of pod tea then you're in for one hell of a withdrawal. Remember me saying all of those opiates combine to make a unique high? Yeah, they also make a unique withdrawal too. One that is fucking hellish.


**Expensive. Heavy, sedating. A unique combination of a bunch of naturally occurring opiates... Which, once you're kicking, will make you understand why we call Nature a Mother.**

Buprenorphine - Suboxone is a life-saver for addicts, but if you don't have a habit I suggest you leave it the fuck alone. You need to know that buprenorphine has a hugely powerful binding affinity to opiate receptors. That means if you take it while high it will rip all the happy heroin molecules off your pleasure buttons and take their place. No big deal, right? Wrong. Because buprenorphine is only a partial agonist it only partially fills those receptors... And it damn sure doesn't fill the happy parts. 

Buprenorphine will keep an opiate dependent individual from going into withdrawal without providing euphoria. If you have a habit no amount of buprenorphine will get you high. As a matter of fact, as huge doses (32 mgs-plus) it will actually start making you sick as it starts competing with *itself* for those receptor spots. Yeah, that's how *stronk* this shit is... No one else is gangster enough, so it starts fight with its-fucking-self. A small dose is enough to keep a junkie well, yo.

**A drug for withdrawal. There's no euphoria here fellas. If taken while high, or too soon after getting high, it will send you into precipitated withdrawal by out-competing your drug of choice. Extremely powerful. Even 2 mg can keep a fiend well. It also takes fucking-forever to get out of your system.**

Heroin - What can I say that hasn't been said by better writers than me? Its morphine with some extra chemicals (thanks Bayer!) that allow it to cross the blood-brain barrier quicker than just about any other opiate. At low, non-IV doses it can be the speedy-euphoria of oxycodone, at moderate doses it can put you on a cloud, euphoric but functional, and at high doses it can put you in that nod state we all know and love.

The snorted come-up is about 5-10 minutes while the IV come-up is *fast,* faster than a morphine shot. Obviously, the stronger the shot the better the rush. And, come on, what the fuck do you want me to tell you about the rush... No bullshit about, ""It feels like you're made of dicks and angels are blowing every inch of you,"" or whatever people say. You either know it or you don't. It is what it is, and what it is is so good you'll do anything to do just one more time.

A quick note though... Obviously heroin bought on the street is never 100% heroin. What we buy is processed in a fuckin' jungle lab and then cut with whatever powder is handy on every stop from that lab to your d-boy. If it has a lot of residual morphine it will give you a pins and needles, morphine-esque rush. If it has a lot of 3 MAM and 6 MAM (like tar does - east coast powder is better processed) then it will give a stronger rush but have shorter legs. (Psycho-pharmacology, bitches!)

**If morphine is the mother, the queen, then heroin is the father and the king. Small doses versus large produce differing results, as does snorting versus IV. Obviously street dope varies from stamp to stamp, dealer to dealer, so the only thing I can really tell you is the same common sense harm reduction shit most of us dumb fuckers ignore - do a test shot, have Narcan handy, and remember you can always do more but never do less.**

Tramadol - ... The fuck outta here with your seizure-causing ass.

**If you do Trams, stick with it and don't step up to anything stronger, okay? Oh, and know it causes seizures at high doses since it lowers your seizure threshold. Stay with Tramadol - you do you.**

Its two years late, but its done. Did I miss any? Because I think I hit all the ones I did... And poppy pod tea is basically poppy sea tea's big brother...

That's all I got. 

Sorry this took, well, forever for me to actually do.

Much love to all of you... Stay well, friends.

> Anyway, the past 7 days I have been doing ULD naltrexone with each shot of heroin. I have also gotten 3 of my friends (also daily users) to do the same. I'm still experimenting with dosing but so far I (as well as my 3 friends) have had INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL results with using ~1-2mcg with each shot of heroin. Here are effects I have noticed (each of my friends claim to get these same effects):


>TOLERANCE

>I had gotten up to at least $20 #4 per shot to even feel slight effects from heroin. I was up to about 3-4 shots per day. AS SOON as I starting adding 1mcg naltrexone to my shots I have been catching extreme nods (like never ever before) from $8 of #4 per shot. 

> Not only has my previous tolerance been obliterated, it does not increase either; if I shoot $8 worth at 10am then another $8 2 hours later the rush is ALL THERE. No decrease in effects with subsequent dosing; each shot is like the first shot of my life no matter how much I've done that day.

>CRAVING

>Previously shooting junk would almost immediately induce cravings to do more and more and more junk. With naltrexone I experience NO craving to do more heroin at all.

>WITHDRAWL

>I have yet to experience WD since I've started doing naltrexone with my dope. Yes I have taken enough time off and have felt no signs of WD as well as no cravings when abstinent.

>Again this is with doses of 1-2mcg per shot of dope, WITHOUT skipping the naltrexone at all with any of my heroin shots. Even after a week I am still nodding HARD (yes right now in fact) from ~$10 of NE #4.

I have been clean from H since may. My girlfriend and I ran into an old friend of hers that was sick and ended up doing some shit in front of me. I haven't been around it at all since I had stopped. I now know that seeing people shoot up makes me want it so much more. And I'm moving back to where I was originally using in a few days and I don't think I can deal with being around people who are still using if they are gonna be doing it in front of me. I'm at a cross roads with it because my best friend recently started shooting up instead of snorting it and I'm petrified of her ODing or dying. side note, we started doing pills together, got clean together, started doing H together, I moved away, she got a bigger habit I stopped using H and only occasionally use pills to kill pain, (two eye surgeries and cancer in my eye)",1445588536.0

Also, possibly disproving a PWD myth.","Sooo, I've been getting really shitty tar lately. Like, completely horrible. It started good and then all my connects had shit. So, I decided it was time to end my binge and get back on my subs. I finished up almost all of the crap tar and went to bed - w the help of some drugs - so I could sleep 12+ hours to prep for sub induction.

&nbsp;

Sleeping 12 hours, waiting only a little bit and inducting has worked for me plenty of times. But, today, 14 hours was not enough time between last dope usage (which was so bad I felt like it wasn't even dope) and the bupe. I went into WDs x 10000000. I have never felt anything like it (and I've been thru WDs countless times). I'm not a suicide kind of guy, but there were several moments where I thought that might be the most viable option (holy fuck! p.s. - don't be alarmed). 

&nbsp;

It was so bad, the RLS wasn't just RLS - it was full body restlessness. I could not even sit down. I had to pace back and forth around my house... of course that was when I wasn't shitting and puking simultaneously (way worse than ever before).

&nbsp;

So, yeah, that happened. It's kinda funny (now) because I use to not even believe PWD was real (I mean, I knew it was, but I felt like it was exaggerated). I have dosed bupe much closer to using before with zero issues. I have no idea how this happened this time. Now, here's the weird part:

&nbsp;

All research on the internet said that using more opiates while in PWDs would make it worse. At that point, I was so bad off that I said fuck it. So, I loaded up a tray and smoked a hit. INSTANT RELIEF. Completely instant. Felt 10000x better. Holy shit.

&nbsp;

I knew I needed to grab another bag and then re-try the induction in a few days with more time between use and dosage. But, I was at the end of the horrible dope bag. So, I tried to cop from a few connects. Nothing. So, I hit up the d-boy with the horrible shit and told him how horrible the last bag was and he said ""this shit is bomb"" (wtf does that mean? idk). I was like, well fine then, I'm coming to cop anyways.

&nbsp;

The drive was horrendous - tons of traffic - started getting sick on the way, but eventually made it.

&nbsp;

Guess what? It's the best tar I've ever bought locally. WTF? So lucky. I guess saying something moved me up the ""cool client ladder"" or something. He acted like he had no memory of selling me some stomped-on shit. Whatever. He knows I want the good shit now.

&nbsp;

Anyways, I'm not quite high bc those subs are still blocking most of it, but I feel good... and I'm not shitting/puking/pacing. So, yay.

&nbsp;

I guess this is useful info for anyone that ends up in PWDs. But, I shouldn't have even been in PWDs, so I can't even say that with confidence. Anyone wanna take a guess at what happened? ",1445582379.0

I'm not good with these fuckin' computers, I got no use for the god damn things, but my sergeant insisted I learn how to use 'em so here I am. I don't like it but unlike you leeching welfare queen thieving junky cocksuckers I ALWAYS follow orders and do as I'm told, hence why I'm not in fuckin' jail right now and got things like a wife that's growing to resent me and two kids who I'm emotionally distant from. Maybe if you decide to quit leeching off the system one day you can have the same. LOL, yeah right! You're so strung out from the ""horse"" (yeah, we keep up on all ya little fuckin' nicknames for drugs) you'll be printing license plates for the rest of ya god damn lives! 

I've been reading a lot of ""posts"" here talking shit about law enforcement and here and how the war on drugs is supposedly ""futile"" and a ""waste of time"" (whatever the fuck that means)  and I think it's fucking disgusting. I'll have you know that my brothers and I have put a major dent in the flow of narcotics not just in New York City, but worldwide as well. We are so close to winning the war on drugs that I can practically fuckin' taste it like my mother's special sauce. With the fettuccine.... Oh Madon, that shit is fuckin good... 

So I'm parked outside a known dope dealer's house watching everyone that comes and goes, minding my own business, when I see this white kid come out clearly high as a god damn kite. I immediately spring into action and get out of my car. This kid had to have been 80 pounds easy, so I call in reinforcements. You know how you fuckin' junkies are... Back in the academy they taught me that heroin addicts can develop super strength that makes them impervious to tasers, so naturally, I called for backup as I boldly attempt to restrain him myself. He's putting his hands up in my face and so I start wailing on him. I had to defend myself, after all. Sure enough when I illegally search this cocksucker he's got two bags of horse in his sweatpants pockets. This piece of shit really had the balls to go into MY CITY, purchase a few items, and peacefully walk back to the subway and go home. Then he starts playing lawyer/smart ass with me. ""You had no probable cause to search me, my nose is broken, I didn't put up a fight..."" You know, typical fucking drug addict shit. Maybe if he didn't break the law he'd still have a functioning nose. But he didn't think about that, did he?!

So I bring him down to the station and tell him he can fuck himself over or he can fuck himself over, it's up to him. He starts telling me ""Oh, I can't give up my dealer! He's connected, he'll fucking kill me!"" and I'm like ""Yeah?! Maybe you shoulda thought about that before you started doing fucking heroin, dummy!"" I mean I had a point. When I wanna relax I reach for a nice cold Budweisser, you know what I'm saying? Anyways the dumb cocksucker didn't talk so I had the judge throw the book at him.I kept him from using this deadly, evil, demonic, substance and took .2 grams of it off the street while saddling him with thousands of dollars in court and lawyer fees that he doesn't have the money to pay for since he's a drug addict derelict sack of shit.

I have been a long time lurker and occasional throw away account poster on this subreddit for a long time. Finally making a more permanent opiate account after moving to the middle of nowhere and having no like minded people around to share my thoughts and struggles with.

Just wanted to introduce myself to everyone and say that I have learned tons from all of your posts and owe you a ton. I really like this the community and feel like becoming a part of it will help me when I get in negative headspace that all junkies get into once in awhile.

For an idea of my opiate use history I have used heavily on both coasts of the good ol US and can say at different points in time my tolerance was around one gram of tar a day, one gram of ecp a day, or three of the og opana 40s a day. All at various times of course and I've only listed three different amounts because all three were different roas. I smoked the tar, sniffed the oxymorphone, and iv'd the heroin. I've used just about every available pharm opiate in the US at some point but have only been physically dependent on the above three. And maybe oxycodone, but honestly I made the switch to dope real quick to save money.

I've fallen out a few times in the past but had my first, wake up in ambulance after being narcaned od about three months ago. Moved to an area where opiates are very hard to find and have been using pst and the occasional u47700 ever since. Not out of choice unfortunately... On top of that I make less than a quarter of what I used to out here.

Unfortunately, this usually drives me to shoplifting. Here's how I raised the funds for today's 100 dollar pick up.

&nbsp;

 *Last night: I needed scrubs for a working interview. Went to Good Will, found a nice pair with The Lion King on the shirt!! Went to the dressing room, balled them up and put them in the crotch of my tights. (I was wearing a dress). Put some clothes left in the dressing room back on the rack on the way out, waddled to the car. Hubby also asked for cough drops, so I went to Food Lion and stole some. I took out a 20, told my husband the thrift store I went to was cash only, and that I used the left overs from his cough drops.

&nbsp;


*Today, Hustle #1: Went to the grocery store. Loaded up a cart with about a 100 dollars worth of food. Walked straight out without paying. I have done this before at this location and have never been caught, or even given a second glance. Go to grocery store number 2, pick up a 2 dollar item and get 65 dollars cash back. Also got a bunch of bags for all the other unbagged items in my car. 

&nbsp;


*Today, Hustle 2: Our dog is long-haired and really needs a proper bath and brushing out as some minor mats are starting to appear. Tell hubby I need 20 bucks for shampoo and conditioner. Go to Petsmart, shove em in my purse, buy a 2 dollar toy and get 20 dollars cash back. To those of you with pets, stealing from Petsmart is the easiest thing ever. I used to work there. most have no cameras. The door detectors are fake, if they are even there. No one is ever in the aisles. 

&nbsp;

This is the convoluted life I live. I'm a young well dressed clean cut white woman with a baby face so I'm not surprised I've never been caught. I wish I could just go to an ATM like a normal person instead of all this shoplifting and cash back shit. At least I have 5 dollars left over once this godforsaken cycle starts over.

I know exactly why she hasn't told me but that doesn't make the hurt any less. I could go on- but I am sitting down now taking on the surreal task of writing my letter for her intervention.  I want to say everything and nothing at the same time. I don't want to use cliches, however appropriate they may be. I don't want to shout at her about how her addiction is affecting everyone else because I know she knows that. Her dealing with guilt is her main problem, her guilt pushes her to use which fuels the guilt even more - the proverbial vicious cycle. I guess I come here asking users and non-users who have gone through this with family members- what the hell do you say/what would you have wanted to hear? I know how loud addiction can be and I want to get past that black veil and really have her hear me. I don't want to shame her or tell her all the pain she's caused, that won't work for her. I want to give her hope but find it hard when the hope seems to be draining away from myself every time I try to wrap my mind around this situation... 

Sorry for the rambling but any stories or help you could provide would be incredible.

So I have come in contact with some 10mg Opana ER's. I have tried hydrocodone and oxycodone before, very few times and in low doses (20mg max). And this was a while back. So being naive to opiates, 10mg oxymorphone makes me nod off to sleep and unable to focus on what I'm doing (ex. playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 2). I never mix my stims and opiates tho. My question is- is it a good idea to add maybe some Adderall or even caffeine to enjoy my opiate high even more? I don't want the stims to take away from my oxymorphone, but I don't want to just fall asleep and waste it.

Also, what's the best way to take the Opana 10mg ER's? I don't feel much just swallowing it whole, since they are the old crushable formulation, I've experimented with crushing into powder and swallowing it, and I've tried going in the nose. I would prefer not to IV pills.",1445546643.0

Slid in easily and registered first try, but I prolly slipped or moved a bit to the side though since I felt some pressure under mx arm. This has happened before and I had no issue so I chalked it up to, well, a substance being injected. I went through all 2mls of dope and felt a slight bump.

Here lately, I've had an undeniable hankering for an evening of solitary naughty gal fun whereby I bang that shit and nod so hahhhhd (holla to my massholes!).

Since most of my like-minded friends IRL are strictly sniffers, I set about prepping by attempting to procure a couple needles in advance. Tonight I arrived at cvs and even used the cover story of needing them for my diabetic dog (a former roommate had this very situation). I explained the insulin scrip had been filled at the vet's office but that the receptionist explained that the syringes were crazy expensive there and, on the sly, advised that they could be procured for a much better price at any pharmacy. The pharmacist, or tech, or pile of horseshit (or whatever she was ...semantics) replied that I would need to provide a copy of the insulin scrip. I explained that I had already filled it at the vet's office but that perhaps I could obtain a photocopy of it and politely thanked her for nothing, regardless.

This is incredibly frustrating as I can think of no legit reason to restrict the sale of these products to anyone over the age of 18, and my fury continues to expand by the moment.

I am an attorney, but I am not currently practicing as I am in the process of building a related business that will make use of my professional background. In the  meantime, I have inactivated my bar membership to save on the annual cost of maintaining my credentials. 

I am also keeping busy working on some writing projects (some relevant to my legal experience) on the side (which is also helpful while I establish my new business in terms of amassing useful experience, as well as bringing in some much-needed income whenever possible). 

After tonight's experience, I am obsessed with the prospect of getting started on a piece discussing the legal issues behind the sale of needles and the issues faced by addicts (and other potential purchasers). I'd like to include the official policies of the big chain pharms and the justification they provide for their policies. In addition, depending on to what length they are willing to speak with me, I would like to hear their thoughts regarding the results of these policies.

Furthermore, I would like to include a number of stories based on the experiences of iv users in their attempts to secure syringes.
Please feel free to let me know your thoughts, opinions, suggestions, etc. If anyone is interested, I would love to sit down for an actual interview or maybe even spend some time shadowing a daily iv user in their attempts to secure supplies. If you like, 
I am glad to credit you using whatever identification preferred.

Some of the biggest fiens i know are the most intuitive/ in touch with what really goes on and can really create that feeling where the way they explained something was never how I would have understood it before. Using or not I am who I am and this battle will continue forever; knowing that i will always be aware that I can find ways to achieve no matter what my situation is. Im excited to be sober for awhile I feel like its part of addiction as much as using is. Just some thoughts. Everyone gettin high tonight enjoy that shit and please be safe, take care of your fellow peers no matter the situation and remember we are not dumb, wrong, or anything else for using. It is part of us and we can overcome it when its time to!

3pyvoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3pyvoi/help_questions_regarding_suboxone_bupe/,7,https://redd.it/3pyvoi,cnote710,Help! Questions regarding Suboxone? (bupe),"How's it going today /r/opiates? Everyone's pupils nice and pinpoint? This is my first post after a short time lurking because I just can't seem to find the answer to my question anywhere!! So if you guys here in this sub could help me out it would be greatly appreciated.

Well to start off with some background on myself, I am a relatively new addict, whose current DOC is intranasal heroin. Last month, however, it was suboxone. Starting, let's say, mid June of 2015 is when I got my first orange strip-(I was not habitually using any other opiate before this)-and I haven't been sober since. I thought I had a clever system with my habit which avoided physical addiction, but it turns out bupe's enormous half life was tricking me... I had a low tolerance; the first time I tried it, 1/2 of a strip made me sick as a dog, but high as a fucking kite. Naturally, I fell in love. Ever since that day, up until mid September, my system to avoid physical addiction would be to take a half-strip 3 days in a row, stop for two days, then start the 3-day trip over again. My logic was that because I was taking that two day break, my body wouldn't get addicted to it (I already knew I was psychologically addicted to it at this point). Oh how naive I was to not even factor bupe's half life into the mix. Anyway, that continued up until about mid-September 2015 when my source dried up. I stopped taking the subs, and sure enough, withdrawal hit me on (you guessed it) the third day without it. I didn't like the withdrawal, but it was the fact that I was no longer high that drove me up a wall. Heroin was the only other opiate that was readily available, and my desire to get high heavily outweighed my fear of the drug. So I've been snorting heroin (never once injected) for about a month now.... But this Monday, I got a new hookup for suboxone, and because that was my original DOC, and it wasn't the heavily stigmatized dope, I went for it. I took my normal sub dose of half a strip, and it kicked the wd's but I barely got high. My pupils weren't even constricted. So over the course of three hours since I had the half-strip, I periodically finished off the other half of the strip and did not get ONE SINGLE BIT HIGHER. Not even a little. I knew my tolerance had risen, but surely doubling the dosage would've made me feel at least something more, right? But now I just started taking 1/8 a strip/day to keep the cravings away (my heroin use was .1/day of some fire, according to the junkie I get it from). So my question for you all is: Did I just not take enough to get high? I know bupe is only a partial agonist, so is that why it no longer satisfies me the way full agonists do? And if that's the case, how long do I have to be off heroin before suboxone can give me that sweet warm high it used to?

TL;DR: I got addicted to suboxone then switched to heroin when my sub source dried up and am now addicted to that. But with new subs coming around I am no longer able to achieve a high from suboxone.

QUESTION: Do I just need more sub to get high because my tolerance has risen? Or can I no longer get high on sub because it is a partial agonist and I am used to full agonists? And if that's the case, how much time away from full agonists do I need to spend in order to be able to get the same high from suboxone again?

I apologize for any grammar/phrasing errors etc.

3pxhqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3pxhqf/girls_breakfast/,18,https://redd.it/3pxhqf,roxys4effy,Girls breakfast.,"As you guys may know, I've been hanging out with a lot of dboys and dealers and just generally, men. I've made a few girlfriends here and there that I can have about 30 minute conversations with, but I've only really connected with one girl. Well, this happened this morning, and I'm starting to realize why me and the girls aren't really the same category of people.

They invite me to breakfast at Ipancakes or whatever. I felt excited. They usually don't go out of their way to include me because I'm just a ""worker"" to them, despite me not actually selling anything. So this was really cool. We get there, and eat, and I notice one of the girls was high. Like, on SOMETHING opiate related. Cool fucking shit, I found another one. When the other two girls go to the bathroom, I ask her about what she's on. 

""ooohhhhh girl, you gotta try this shit. It's SO awesome. It's helped me lose weight and i just genuinely love everyone."" 

*""Alright, what is it? I'm willing to try anything. Downers are my thing.""*

""Oh its this little pill. Idr the name, but I can give you a couple once we get back. Be careful though, shit's strong.""

FUCK. YES. I'm about to get some high fucking grade pharmaceuticals. My mind was dancing with dillys and pandas the whole ride home. I was so damn excited. 

We get back and go up to her room. I am told with EXPLICIT directions to NOT tell anyone else about this, and that her dealer has to deliver it to her window so people don't find out. Blah blah blah, closet junkie stuff.  She tosses me the bottle and says to take 3. LOVE FREE DRUGS. 

""Girl, take ONE of those things."" *I'm fighting the cap to get said drugs out of this bottle.* ""I really don't want you to OD on us again, and XXXXX would KILL me if he found out."" *Damn near takes a hammer to hit to get these damn pills. Uh oh.*

**FUCKING LETDOWN**.  These REALLY strong pills were fucking perc 10s. PERC FUCKING 10s. and to make matters worse, SHE SNORTS THEM. 

Now what I'm REALLY trying to figure out is how a female who is so close to the drug world has no idea about the basics of opiates. I know it's mostly a coke and xanax world here, but does she google? I mean, it BLEW my mind that she had no idea bout the APAP issue, or liver process. All of which i told her. I also gave her a mini lesson on opiates and how strong things were compared to the dope she's watched me bang. 

---------------------------------------------------------

I'm just so confused and shocked that she's so close to the game and has such little knowledge about drugs. Granted, she speaks fucking perfect spanish and english, but you get my point. Do guys purposely keep their females ignorant of drugs? Or was she just a special snowflake?  ",1445621042.0
3pxeg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3pxeg5/waste_of_space/,23,https://redd.it/3pxeg5,_HolyMacaroni,Waste of Space,"I had over a month clean. I was going to meetings, albeit not as many as I probably should have been, but I was going to meetings. Living in a sober house, spending time with sober people. I had resisted the urges to re-activate my facebook to hunt down any of my old dealers. Bad days remained just ""bad days"" instead of relapses. I had stopped taking my naltrexone because I ran out and couldn't at the time afford the co-pay for a refill. Or, that's what I told myself.

So I have had the same wallet for maybe six months. It's where I used to keep my stash, all my empty bags, etc. When I OD'd in August, the police thoroughly searched it and confiscated all drug-related contents. On top of that, my father and boyfriend searched it themselves before bringing it to me in rehab. On top of THAT, the rehab I was in searched it THEMSELVES to make sure I wasn't having any drugs snuck in.

I'm out to dinner with my boy, TGI Chilli-bees or some similar bullshit. I take out my wallet (he pays for dinner and I leave the tip, is usually how it goes), open it up on my lap and lo-and-be-fucking-hold, a little yellow bag with the top torn off and an easily-distinguished tan powder sitting at the bottom. My mouth drops; I recognize this bag from a batch I bought and did three or four months ago, where the fuck did it come from? My mind races. The rational part of me insists I throw my whole wallet on the table and let my man handle it, flush the rogue bag down the toilet and do a full sweep for any other offenders that might be lurking in the folds of this leathery traitor. 

Surprise surprise, the dumb mother fucker that lives in my brain wins. I close my wallet and stuff it back into my purse, and feign normalcy for the rest of the night. Back at his place, I make up a sad excuse to leave and book it. Sitting in my car, parked maybe half a block down the street from his house, I pull the little yellow devil out and put it on the dash in front of me. My mind races. One bag? If I recall, this wasn't even that fabulous dope, would it be worth losing my sobriety over one shitty little bag? Probably not... but what if there were more than one bag? 

Out comes my wallet. I pull the credit cards, gift cards, license, cash, receipts, and everything else taking up space out of their little leather homes, and begin rifling. I know there's nothing there. There's no way that little yellow bag made it through five rounds of vigorous searches, let alone ANOTHER little yellow bag. But wait, in the second to last little leather slot where I keep my half-used victoria's secret gift card, I find my little yellow bag a twin. My mouth drops open in disbelief like I'm in a B-rated horror movie and I just discovered the butler has been murdering poor motherfuckers all along.

It's impossible, but here it is. Two free bags, literally dropped into my lap. It's obviously some kind of sick joke; Let's See How Far We Can Push The Junkie Until She Breaks! Turns out, that is EXACTLY how far I can be pushed until I break. I'm high by the end of the night.

It's been almost a month since that slip (because that's what it was, a slip), and I managed to turn one little slip into a full blown relapse. I'm sliding back down a VERY slippery slope. I've just started to get my shit together. I've JUST STARTED regaining the trust of my loved ones. I have *plans* for the near future. I have a boy who loves me, I have friends who don't do drugs, I have two jobs, I almost have my life back... and I'm willing to flush it all down the toilet that I should have used to flush those two stupid little fucking yellow bags nearly a month ago. 

Last night I got high for maybe, hopefully, God willing, the last time. I got high as a fucking kite and I sat in the r/Opiate tinychat with people who I care about and want the best for, and I nodded out and vomited and had a fucking blast. And then I woke up this morning and contemplated driving my car off of a bridge. 

This community is amazing, and I know if anyone will understand this crippling self-loathing I'm currently gripped with it will be you guys. 

I feel like a waste of space. I know if my recent digressions were found out, the sound of hearts breaking around me would be deafening. I would lose everything like **that**. I would immediately be kicked out of my sober house and homeless, my boy would (understandably) leave me to save himself the trouble of watching me drive myself to the brink of insanity again, my father would give up on me, I would give up on myself. 

I chose this life for myself, it seems, and I haven't got the foggiest clue how to unchoose it. The thought of waking up every single morning with that ache, that craving deep in my belly, is nauseating. My life would be better off lived by someone who knows how to appreciate it.

Cue an hour ago. I get up still in my benzo retardation, do my shot and immediately start to nod. Fuck. So I get up to go pee. Now, remember guys, I live in the Midwest and its in the low 40s, meaning that toilet seat was FUCKING COLD. I have this brilliant idea to squat over it and save my ass the Antarctic experience. Well, I must have nodded out because I fell face first into the wall. Fuuuuuuck. Need a pick me up. I gather what's left of my dignity after already fucking up this poorly so early and head back down stairs. 

Young sketch is up, and I start talking to him as I make my yayo shot. Blah blah prison pouch. Can you hold my tablet? Shit like that. I bang this shot and feel great.  Young sketch loses his shit. It suddenly hits me which container i just used. 

""You know that was in my asshole for 8 hours right?""

*""not my fault you wanted a new buttplug""*

Hes really pissed now haha. But fuck him for sitting there and letting me do that 

Goddammit. I'm not dead though, and the shot didn't feel ANY different than normal so I'm assuming double bagging that shit was a good call. ",1445782327.0
3q5bjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3q5bjk/a_blue_weekend/,10,https://redd.it/3q5bjk,madscientistyo,A blue weekend,"So obviously almost every user's dream is to be a controlled chipper or just to have unlimited money and never have to worry about WDs. I have something in the middle that's been working great for me the past few months but it may be considered chipping. One reason I think it's not quite chipping is because I've been doing the opi thing for a while and feel like I know when I'm about to make too many stupid decisions but I also learned that you never know when that craving impulse will possess you. Anyway:

I take low dose subs every day; like 2mg roughly, and that controls my cravings as well as anything could- but not completely and fully.

So every once in a while, when the cravings pile up or I feel like I need a little vacation, I treat myself to buying JUST enough for one fun weekend. By Sunday night or Monday morning I'm back on the subs, but my mind and body are satisfied for a while and switching back to the subs is easy. 

I don't log my use or anything; I just use as little as I can to the point I can control my urges. But I have found that with this pattern, I only have these vacation weekends about once every 3 weeks.

This weekend I got myself 5 Roxie's and my only rules were to have fun and finish them before the work week starts. It's Sunday and I still have one and a half left; obviously I wish I had saved a bit more, but my low tolerance lets me likely take the rest of those early today, and by tonight I will be able to switch back to subs without precip WDs (I wait till WD symptoms but I have never needed to wait 24 hours for induction; usually closer to 8-12 depending on what I was fucking with before).

So yeah, good weekend, still another fun afternoon ahead, then I can feel refreshed and safely back on subs for work.

Anyone else do this and find it successful or realistically sustainable? Maybe it's considered straight chilling but it feels easier and still allows me indulge just enough to fill the times where the cravings bubble up to make me pick up for a weekend.

Anyway, mostly just wishing everyone a good Sunday.",1445780423.0

Know what most fatal OD stories have in common? Rehab, either professional or home DIY, the addict quits cold turkey and then after PAWS and life become unbearable they use again and drop dead because their tolerance is low or non-existent.

The solution is for society and the rehab industry to STOP idolizing getting ""clean"" or quitting, this is not the issue. The issue is whatever is driving an addict to need opiates and or use them recklessly.

The solution is easy to access methadone, you should be able to go to any doctor and say I am an addict help and get a script for methadone to take like a normal med.

Oh no addicts will just do this to get drugs!/s WHO CARES, they are already addicts!

People should find it easy to get stabilized, get off the fucking hamster wheel we all know, and then work on building their life back up and only THEN do we let the addict drive getting clean if they desire.

Even when she found out she was *still* willing to work at it, the amount of patience that girl had for me was unreal.

Basically if I eat or drink something that is too fatty/oily I get severe pain and half the time I use PST i get that pain.

Now I'm not look for any crazy chemistry or some way to extract out the actives, drinking it works just fine for me and I've seen some of the teks and they look tedius, take forever, and seem to have crappy results.

Basically I was wondering if there is an easy way to remove as much of the fats/oils as possible. I've read about melting paraffin wax in your tea, at 160F to not degrade any actives, and then letting it cool until the wax hardens up and filter that supposedly removes the oil/fats. But I couldn't see any evidence that his works or experience reports so I thought I'd ask you guys if it would work. What do you think? Seems odd that I can find no information on paraffin wax being used to defat things.

Or could I just let my tea settle like a broth and remove the top layer of fat/oils with a scooper? I figure it may take awhile but if I boiled it real quick that would destroy any bacteria that might build up. 

Also, is 160F really the magical temp that no degradation occurs or is it higher. I've read mixed things, a rolling boil wouldn't destroy any of the actives or that a touch over 160 wrecks everything. Just don't want to weaken my tea.

Thanks guys I appreciate any and all input.

Friday night, about 11pm and all I wanted to do was get home and fall asleep. Thats when mr Ferrari and I met. He was doing 90 mph and I turning onto my street 1000 feet from my front door. The last thing I heard was screeching tires before waking up in the emergency room. 

Its just a machine no big deal I'll get a new one and we can all move on with our lives. My neck really hurts though I'm sure its just sore, a visit to the chiropractor and life will be back to normal. 

One doctor to the next, this procedure that medecine nothing seems to work. Until 6 months into trying everything under the sun I was introduced to a small round white pill. 

""Just take one when the pain gets real bad"". Those words ring through my ears every single day. At first It was once every few weeks, my back is bothering me very bad today and Mr Percocet will help lull me off to sleep. 

Just one more, I promise myself no more pills, err when this prescription runs out I won't get any more. 

1 more month is all I need, after rI fill this last script no more. 1 tiny little pill once a month becomes 1 tiny pill once a week becomes 1 a day. Than its just 1 to get out of bed and 1 to whisk me off to dream land. ""Today has been tough, what could it hurt if I just wash one extra down with my lunch"", Tomorrow i'll be back to normal. 

Just one more little pill is all I need, I promise I won't take any more tomorrow, but the pain is so bad I just need 1 more today.

For those unfamiliar, the brompton cocktail was a drug mixture containing morphine (or heroin), cocaine, and highly pure alcohol, as well as sometimes an anti-nausea drug like antihistamines or back this drug was used commonly,  cannabis tincture.  Anyways, its basically the medicinal speedball, but it hasn't been used or manufactured in north america in decades.

I can totally see the medicinal properties for this. It was mostly used into end of life pain, chronic cancers and basically when death was near. They used to give it to people on their death beds because it would apparently ""put the life back into them"" so their family could see them ""happy"" and social  during their final hours.

Does anyone else use these drugs in combination and feel that synergy? i love it too much, and if i knew it was powerful enough to give people with hours to live joy and happiness, I would have never touched the shit because thats quite scary. 

Can you actually IV alcohol? Wouldn't that be extremely dangerous, corrosive on the veins and could damage your liver since you don't metabolize it?  Has anyone did it? Or an anti-histamine for that matter?

I love doing speedballs, but usually I won't even do it unless I have a few beers or shots in me first. I'm not the biggest drinker, far from it, but i associate alcohol with drugs because i never just drink. I've gone months without drinking when i've quit cocaine in the past. I guess it makes the comedown easier, and of course creates coca-ethylene so it lasts longer. I crave cocaine hard when I drink but i never drink socially at all, because after one beer my mind is fixated on cocaine, so I avoid the booze.  and the thing is, I CAN'T just IV cocaine alone. 

Without the opiate, it feels like im having a heart attack and i get super anxious, I haven;t done cocaine without opaites in about a year because the comedown is just so awful but with opiates the comedown is virtually nonexistent and i'm able to go to sleep afterwards, and not be plagued with anxiety and that dopamine crash. If I experiance that crash, a few mg of hydromorphone and a drink and it's gone. I was addicted to vallium for a few months this year, and It replaced alcohol for me. But i quit, would never touch the stuff again and IMO, benzos lack the euphoria of alcohol, and damaged my memory so much during that time period I was showing up at work on my days off not knowing what day it was. 

The sunrise of my soul is 2 or 3 shots of brandy, and immediately cookng up my hit, 16 mg of hydromorphone and 1.5 points of good quality coke in one go is what i call my perfect dose ( i manage to keep my tollerance low and withdrawls at bay for the most part through breaks), and while that rush overwhelms me i blast the tunes and smoke a joint of of about 3 parts bud, 1 part tobacco or so. Although usually I'm rushing so hard I only take a few drags then put it out.  I supposed its similar to the brompton cocktail, and when I first found out about it i thought ""oh shit, doctors gave people speedballs?""

there isn't a lot of information on it because it's kinda  an ancient medicine that has been used sine 1896 but of course hasn't been commonplace since cocaine's stigma started.

Does anyone have any information on this? Know anyone who has had it? I consider this my perfect buzz, so whats your perfect high? I wouldn't recommend this obviously, or at least snort the shit instead of smashing it. I do my best to not use everyday, but it has made me quit using opiates everyday because  I would rather IV speedballs once or twice a week and be satisfied than shoot opiates all day everyday and wake up sick and shit.

Constantly packs heat, always feels the need to have drugs on him, loves coke and Xanax, and of course, is a complete fucking idiot. 

We're driving to our last drop, which ended up being a ball and some perc 10s (lol). I'm driving and I have this wrecked fucking 18 year old, wanna be OG in the passenger seat. Hes been drinking since like 2pm, has eaten god knows how many footballs and has been blowing yayo for the whole trip. He refuses to stfu for more than 30 seconds. Random fact: he hates faygo. 

Of course, there are cops out and about which is no biggie. I'm used to it. Well this kid is a bad fucking omen. I get pulled over. Fuck me, right? The following happens in a matter of 45 seconds. I'm still in shock at his speed.

As I acknowledge the cops and start to pull over, this kid kicks out the floorboard where some of the fuses are, and stashes the gun. He hands me the pills as I'm begging for the ball because I can hide it on my person A LOT better, or so I thought. As the cop is still in his car, and I had JUST put it in park, this kid is pulling his pants back up. What the fuck did he just do. I'm wiping my nose, grabbing my wallet and practically in panic mode. Here we go. 

Turns out, I forgot my directional and because he ""smelled weed"" we're both searched. He finds nothing. He didn't ask for the car (I'm not sure why) and lets us on his way with a warning. PHEW.  Crisis averted. I give him the pills back and told him to just hold the coke cos we were almost there. Cue destination arrival.

*""I can't. I fucking hurts, to.""* WELL NO SHIT. 

""BRO. Push and pick man."" This is when I realize I'm giving this kid instructions how to pull drugs out of his asshole. 

We were there ANOTHER HOUR and still had no luck. Our customer rotates between laughing and giving the kid sympathy. Hes a 50 year old black guy, which made it all the better. So I resign to the fact we'll be back because this dumbass lost a ball in his asshole. Our customer is understanding.

We get back in the car and he's sitting with his ass in the air (he also waddled outside lmao) using his legs as leverage. I have no idea how to explain this.

We get back to a house PACKED full of people. I pretty much drag him to my dude like a toddler who colored on the walls. My guy immediately sees something is off.

Me: tell him.

Dude: tell me what?

Young sketch: nooo you tell him. (Hes turning bright fucking red)

Dude: TELL ME WHAT ESE?

Young Sketch: I have a ball stuck in my ass.

Obviously I loved the stronger stuff, but for some reason I especially enjoyed the codeine. I know it's not considered the most worthy drug of choice but smething about how subtle the high is compared to say, oxy's (which I've dabbled in) or morph, and how I can use pretty much all day and still function appeals to me.

I've had to go from pharmacy to pharmacy in the last 6 years, in order to not to raise suspicion, and I've become so good at faking migraines its not funny. I used to use ibuprofen/codeine mixes but the ibu fucked up my stomach so bad I swapped to paracetmol (acetomphienm(?)). I now have permananetely damaged my stomach lining so bad that I can no longer drink more than 1 drink without crippling pain, or take ibuprofen or aspirin ever again. A normal person would have made the decision at the point to STOP USING OTC PILLS RECREATIONALLY but I simply swtiched to a different kind. Because I'm an idiot.

I know it could be so much worse. I've used oxy's for a short period in the past, but the cost was prohobitive and I got over it. At one oint I sucked a dude's dick to get access to his scripts for oxy - turns out it was XR and I didn't even enjoy it.

I don't see myself turning to anything harder than oxy's (I've been to hospital with the aformenetioned stomach pains and they gave me a shot of morphine, which was awesome, but I don't desire to chase that feeling). 

Everytime I think about stopping, or even sucessfully stop for weeks at a time, I remember how greatly normal using makes me feel and I don't. I have no self control in this regard and I probably never well. No one in my personal life knows I do this. I once went to a doctor when I was ""coming down"" (coming down from codeine is actually quite bad - RLS, sweats, and diarrhea) and he gave me a short valium script. He's the only person I've ever told about all this, and now you guys.

I just wanted to be able to share that. I've never done this before because it's actually embaressing to admit being addicted to fucking OTC medications. I'd be less embaressed to admit shooting up heroin everyday than this.

Background: been shooting dope off and on for 6 years with occasional 3 to 6 month breaks. For the last two years, I've been using around 2 to 5 days a month. However, for the last 3 to 4 weeks, I've been using every day. (Found a connect with amazing prices/quality.)

The problem: about 10 days ago, my veins stopped registering. I can see them perfect, have no trouble with the needle, just can't register. EXCEPT for one place in my hand. What's weird is, I have to point the needle straight down into my hand. No angle whatsoever. The blood shoots up really fast. I have to have a tie on and can't let go till I'm almost done injecting or I lose the register. I have to injection very slow. A few days ago I did it too fast and even though it didn't burn, my hand went number and swelled up. I've been snorting since then.

My questions: anyone have the problem where they can't register? Even when your veins seem totally fine? Fresh needles, tried multiple angles, etc. Also, was I injecting into an artery? I forgot to mention, when I inject into that spot on my hand, when I pull the needle out there's always a little drop of heroin solution that comes out of the spot I injected. I know it's heroin cause it very light pink where it's mixed with the blood and tastes like heroin. Anyways, sorry for all the words, but any theories on my troubles? Thank you much!

3q3e15,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3q3e15/hydroxyzine_oxymorphone_potentiation_ongoing/,6,https://redd.it/3q3e15,joshualeet,Hydroxyzine + Oxymorphone potentiation on-going experiment results,"So a friend of mine was really prescribed Hydroxyzine for anxiety and they don't help him at all, so we worked out a few things and I have my hands on #14 50mg Hydroxyzine's. 

Today was my first day experimenting with them as a potentiator my my DoC, Oxymorphone (dosed intranasally.)

I had read about Hydroxyzine being a better potentiator than other anti-cholergenics and anti-histamines (like phenergan, Benadryl, etc.) but there were mixed reviews as with everything. Some people praised it as the end-all be-all opiate potentiator so since the option presented itself, I jumped on it. 

This will be an on-going thread, or I will create new ones with previous and new results each day as they happen. So without further ado, let's get into Day 1, Test 1. 


**Test #1**
So today, I took 50mg Hydroxyzine at approx. 2:15pm and dosed ~10mg Oxymorphone intranasally. 

*Note: 10mg of Oxymorphone is a low/conservative dose for me. I usually dose about 20mg to start off with, and add a 10-15mg dose an hour or two later. My tolerance is off the charts, unfortunately. Dosing 40mg Oxymorphone will have me feeling good, but it will not having me nodding unless I've mixed it with some Xanax.*


So, back to the Hydroxyzine. It normally takes about 15-25 minutes to feel the effects of Oxymorphone, ~45 minutes to feel full effects/peak and ride the blissful plateau. 

Within 10 minutes, I began to feel a euphoria rise over me that I have not felt since the very beginning of my Opana usage. It wasn't ""I need to sit down"" intense, but it was very noticeable, much quicker and more intense than taking opana by itself, taking it with any other anti-histamine potentiator, more so than grapefruit juice and more so than DXM. Before finding this, DXM has been my go-to potentiator. It looks like I abuse it and robo-trip daily by the amount of bottles I have in the trash, but taking 90-120mg of DXM prior to my opiates does not affect euphoria (IMO) but most certainly brings forth the nods very hard. Besides DXM, I stick with Xanax as my ""potentiator,"" usually at night to help with nodding and falling assert/staying asleep. 

As of writing this post, it is 4:55pm and while writing this, I've been chatting up a storm with a friend of mine, yet another aspect of Opana that made me fall in love with it but has faded with tolerance. The Hydroxyzine, I feel, has brought that back out. 


I have of course considered that this could all be a placebo effect and am not going to give a definitive answer on it yet, but so far, all signs are pointing toward ""yes motherfucker, this shit is the shit."" I do not plan on re-dosing the Hydroxyzine until tomorrow morning before my morning Opana dose. I want to have a completely clear head and feel a little sick, so I can see how much quicker it helps the Opana take affect and how strong it potentiates those effects. 

I will update this thread tomorrow. 


**Quick update edit:** As of 5:12PM, I am beginning to feel the very strong urge to nod. I'm having to force myself awake because I still have some things to do. This NEVER happens to me, seemingly no matter how much Opana I take on it's own. But man, that 50mg an hour before a low dose (for me) of Opana has me feeling fresh. I am actually quite surprised, as I didn't get my hopes up that the semi-hype surrounding it. 


That concludes the update for now. I'd appreciate hearing any anecdotes about Hydroxyzine potentiating your opiate of choice or any experience you've had with Hydroxyzine.

I am currently out for the weekend. The one day I forced myself to go without, I suffered sweats, but I didn't really think much of it because I suffer sweats sometimes as a symptom of my migraines.

I am also having trouble with diarrhea, as I did the day I forced myself off the pills.

My question is, in your opinion, am I addicted to these things or are my symptoms (sweats and diarrhea) psychosomatic?

I am not handling my own stash at the moment, because I think I nearly OD'd and gave everything to my spouse. He gives them to me as prescribed now, but neglected to count how many I had left. My doctor wasn't in on Friday when spouse told me, and my nurse offered to call in Tramadol for me, but I declined as Tramadol makes me puke and also aggravates my migraines.

Society is ok with suburban housewives popping Vicodin all day, but users like us that actually get powder or tar are just disgusting thriving dick sucking junkies. 
Opiates make people happy and calm, helps anxiety and helps with social situations. 
Of course some of us like shooting to the point of drooling and almost overdosing- but that's their decisions. 
I guess I just wait for the day where drugs are actually legal thanks to the ""FREEDOM"" we have here in America.

Relapsed right after / during my planned detox weekend at the end of day 3. Now considering checking into an inpatient rehab. So lonely and sad.,"Some of you guys know that I had planned to detox this past weekend by leaving NYC to stay with my family in this suburbs of a different city. 

My last usage before the weekend was Thursday night and I used 2.5 buns that night. My habit had become almost 3buns/day, which is so unbelievably unsustainable. After being in a situation where I wasn't getting high anymore, just normal, unless I sniffed 2 buns all at once, I decided that what I was doing was crazy. I also I have been out of work and need to get off H by the time I return in a week or so.

So...the detox. I had clonidine, lorazepam, gabapentin, lope, and a small amount of kratom (each for a couple doses). 

Friday was a breeze. Had the runny nose, diarrhea (until I upped the lope), among other things, but I felt okay enough to be around people and sleep through the night. 

Saturday was miserable. All of the physical and psychological symptoms of the max. Kratom did seem to help, but I ran out by early evening. Cravings had also began creeping into my mind, despite being so committed to getting clean just one day before.

Sunday was pretty miserable as well. More or less indistinguishable from Saturday. And that brings me to my fuck up.

Right as I'm getting ready disboard the train, I get a text from delivery dboy asking if I need anything and my mind immediately becomes consumed by the idea of having that sweet warmth of lady H wash over my body. I meet him on my way back to my apartment and I'm back on the H train before I can't even think about what I have done.

So this might be it. I really can't control myself anymore and think I may need an inpatient rehab. Has anyone attended one of these and have any positive for negative recommendation they can share? Anyone else have any general tips?

Feeling quite upset with myself and feel like I really need to make a radical decision, like going away for while, if I'm going to get clean. 

TLDR: Planned to detox this past weekend by leaving the city. Made it to end of day 3 and then relapsed when dboy hit me up. Now considering inpatient rehab or whatever else y'all recommend. 

EDIT: On top of all of this, I fell out really hard last night. Was asleep for a couple hours and woke up with a bad headache, out of breath, and freezing cold shivering like I never have before. Could not stop shaking/shivering for over an hour and felt a different kind of cold than I ever have felt before. Made a post in the comments about this, but figured I should edit this post as well.",1445832497.0

I'd rather not say they dosage because I know there are those who benefit greatly from it and I do not want to be a part of taking away the free will of using this substance.


Now, I will say, at high doses the cold turkey withdrawals have been the most grueling thing that I've ever been through (I've had experience with IV heroin, about .5-1 gram a day of black tar, which I haven't touched in over 3 years.} With the help of heavy doses of lope, clonazolam, and gabapentin, I have been able to function at about 80-90%. Its been a god send, There is some depression there but it's nothing that I can;t handle for now.


Now, I know there are members on this board who have taken MEGA (and I mean MEGA compared to the general populous that thinks a 200mg dose is insane) I'm currently trying to taper down/lay off for a few days because the financial burden is becoming too much


Anyways,the point of this post is if anyone knows the equalanalgesic/tolerance properties of tianeptine compared to the classics>


If anyone knows the equivalency between morphine or another classic opioid/opiate I would be so very thankful.

Anyways, if anyone has any input, that would be just awesome.",1445830295.0

""Umm, drugs?"" was your matter of fact reply. 
""Yes, let's take the girl who lives in rehab to go cop.""

But of course, I went with you anyway. I hit you up fully aware that there was a very good possibility that I would get high if I saw you. 

When I first met you in the motel room, and sold you the dope, I wasn't blown away by the nondescript, dopey looking boy standing in front of me. I wasn't overwhelmed with attraction. But when you came back that night, and sat real close to me, I got to thinking, ""He's pretty cute, actually."" And the tweakers stealing my money while you fucked me in the shower was kind of a blessing in disguise because now we had the room to ourselves. I only had fifty bucks anyway. 

So here I was months later, getting high with you. You hit me because my veins are fucking beat. And the rush was as sweet as the rush of being with you again. But you faded away, and I've not seen you since.

And now I'm back to being clean, and you're gone, but you're still on my mind.

About .3-.4. It was a bit white colored, which had me paranoid about fent but I did extremely slow lines throughout the night. 

Well I wasn't were I wanted to be exactly so I did a slightly bigger line, then put what was left away (I still have a good little bit left). 

At this point I was nodding really fucking hard. I couldn't function for shit. I grabbed some vanilla coke from the fridge to get some caffeine in my and started chain smoking my vape so I wouldn't pass out.

Woke up around 5:30AM, leg hurt like crazy and I could barely stand on it (I'm assuming I passed out in an awkward position). I had left the windows open in the attic and forgot to turn the heater on, so I was fucking **FREEZING**. I was extremely nauseous and made it downstairs from the attic to the bathroom. Turned the sink on, turned the shower on and then proceeded to vomit a fuck load in the toilet. No blood though thankfully. Took a shower, the water felt amazing and it helped me stop shaking and eased the pain in my leg.

Got out, took some magnesium and B6. Sipped water slowly. Ended up vomiting again shortly after.... Took some potassium, and then fell back asleep until around 11AM.

Still feeling slightly shitty right now, but it's only pressure in my head. I thought I was in completely OD again when I woke up... I've had this happen before but was vomiting blood and couldn't hear anything. Had to be shot with nalaxone, etc....

So thanks to JJ for looking out for me. I'm staying at my brother's house with his wife and my 4 year old niece. I recently became homeless because of my pregnant EX girlfriend who kicked me out. I couldn't even begin to imagine what they would have thought if I ODed and died in their attic.

Even though we had tripped together a handful of times he continued to use it. And I continue to do as I do. But in that moment I took a glimpse into his world. And it was one I hope never to return to.

I pulled in the driveway early that morning. After finally getting him to answer his phone he invites me inside. A series of doors and hallways leads us to the closet. Lines set up and blowtorch in hand he teaches me how to hot rail. It is free today, but only if I do it his way. I guess he just wanted to share the experience with me. Well thanks a fucking ton buddy.

The first day was fine. Smoking pot and exploring. All while geeked out of our minds. By day two I have to drop him off. I figured it would be a good idea to buy a little bit. He gladly excepts even though it was from his personal. At least he is smart enough to see what has happened to everyone else in our town and not deal the shit. It ends with a lengthy sentence everytime. 

After finally getting away from him I start going at the bag with the needle. then I understand. The euphoric rush is unlike any other. And it is the first to go. After the euphoria fades the remaining side effects remain. The jitteriness, the speedy mind. All of it minus that amazing euphoria. So you continue chasing the euphoria. I did at least. All day. That night we went camping.

I tried to shelter my other three friends I had spent the day with. They were not partaking. So when the campsite was set up they passed out from a long day of smoking pot. And I was left with no one but my self and the shadow people I had yet to meet.

Obviously I prepped another shot. Knowing the whole time it would be a better idea to just catch some sleep. Then it hit me full force. I could hear and feel the presence of something. Leaves kept hitting the ground, but that wasn't it. I heard footsteps. Quickly grabbing my flashlight I tried to find the source of the noise but whatever it was would stop everytime I started fucking with flashlight. I stopped shining it in one place for too long when the faces started appearing out of no where.

I tried to distract myself. I tried so very hard to tell myself that this was all a product of the drug and the fact that I was sleep deprived. But it just doesn't work like that. Especially not when there is something in the shadows. After 4 hours of this hellish hunt I saw it. A fucking possum. That bastard must have been cold and just trying to get to the fire. Finally I laid down and caught an hour of sleep.

We leave the campsite and drop my buddy off at his house. Then I decided it was enough. I poured the last bit out and burned the Baggie to make sure it was all gone. I hit up my old friend and dropped the rest of the needles at his house. 

That shit was made by Satan himself. Pure negative energy condensed into a crystalline form. Two days was enough for me to realize that I want no part of that life. If I never see that again a day in my life I think I'll be just fine. ",1445799373.0

So I decided to leave thinking she would come to her senses. Nope nothing not even a text.

This is not the same girl I've known for 8 years. 
I really believed she was the one. Now she s off blowing her chances of getting the kids back and uz raise em together as a family. Its torn me to pieces and she won't even tell me why.

I used to watch intervention with my girlfriend and wonder how do people let things get this bad... this out of control.  Well, throw me in that group.  I can't go on living like this anymore.

First time poster and long time lurker here - never actually tried an opiate before but I regularly read the posts here as I am fascinated by them. To me, this forum is a window into a lifestyle I have never and will never be able to experience first hand. Made my first reddit account to share my story!

Anyway, I am the manager of a restaurant in south east England. A couple of months ago, an employee came into work high as a kite, and looking as if he was about to fall asleep which lead me to believe he was high on opiates. There is no doubt in my mind that this time last year I would have fired him on the spot for coming into work high. But now, after spending some time reading the posts here I am a lot more understanding when it comes to drug use. 

I told him that there's no way I want him working in this state. I sent him home for the day and told the others he was unwell, and had a meeting with him the next day. In the meeting I told him that what he does in his own time is up to him, but I don't want him coming into work in that state again. He understood and for a couple of weeks we carried on as normal. Then, about a week ago when reading the posts here as usual I stumbled across a post that really affected me. It was a post from a user that said he felt trapped in his addiction because he needs the opiates to function at work, and he wasn't sure what he could do short of quitting his job. This got me thinking about my employee, and I started to wonder if he had ever had similar thoughts. 

The next day I invited him into my office and I told him that I wasn't sure if what happened the other week was a one time thing, or if he has a habit of drug use, but if there was anything I could do to help he can always let me know. I emphasised that as long as it doesn't affect him during work hours what he does in his own time is his business and not mine, but I told him that I am aware that some drugs can be very hard to stop using, and if he ever wanted to and  needed any time off to go through withdrawals or whatever, he need only let me know and I will give him all the sick leave he needs and tell the others that he's just unwell. He was delighted, and took me up on my offer. This was on the 21st. 

As far as I was concerned he would be off for 2 weeks, but he came back in to work today and told me he was starting to feel normal again! He was so grateful, which was an amazing feeling for me as an employer. I just wanted to thank this community for opening my eyes, as I say, this time last year I would have fired him on the spot, but this subreddit has taught me some valuable lessons.

Thank you everyone!",1445890008.0

I spent probably two and a half hours TEARING the house apart, looking in drawers, in purses I haven't touched in weeks, EVERYWHERE to no avail. It becomes apparent that my dumb ass probably left that shit locked in the car. Great.

Call dad, he doesn't have a spare key. I google how to break into cars, opt for the shoelace method as my car has older locks that stick up out of the side of the door, little knobs you puil up/push down to lock and unlock the doors.

I've been a user, off and on for over a year. My longest clean times were 2 weeks. I have brought my oxy use down from 60mg a day (10mg every 4 hours) to 30mg a day (7.5mg every 4 hours, but not to exceed 4 doses)....so not a large habit.

Recently I've been trying to stop all together. Quit with a weird rapid taper.... 
Monday: 7.5mg oxy 4 times a day
Tuesday: 7.5mg oxy in morning + 10mg norco late afternoon
Wednesday: 5mg norco once
Thursday: 8mg lope and a lot of weed
Then nothing but weed. 

Unfortunately I only stayed clean until Saturday (so technically 3 days of no opiates). I only used for 2 days (30mg first day and 15mg second day).

How much did I reset my withdrawals? I have no more weed (which I was using as a total crutch), and I have to still take care of my 3 kids and husband. 
I'm off work until Friday, should I be okay by then (in your personal opinion, as I know everyone is different and their bodies work differently)?",1445883698.0

They pulled me right out of bed I shit you not. No shirt no shoes no service is not the policy. So I was taken to jail, for the fourth time in two months, where I was left to white-knuckle the entirety of heroin WD for the first time in my life. Which now I understand, is exactly what I needed to happen, as replacement (sub/done) was too easy of a way out to keep me from resuming the game of tag with my buddy brown. I stayed in touch with my rents (who thank god have remained supportive) but left me to sit until I wised up and arranged inpatient therapy. Which also helped out to reduce my absolutely massive bond. To treatment I went and I have been absolutely exstatic since I passed about the three week mark when I began rising out of the 7th ring of hell known as opiate withdraw. Never again... Like the holocaust! I had an amazing experience at the first treatment center, (it may or may not be located in SD). And now I am sitting on a bed too big for me to know what to do with anymore, in a MN Holliday inn anticipating checking into treatment center number two near the twin city area where I will remain, far from home, for a long time. But never have I been more excited. It feels too amazing to be actually enjoying the little things in life again for the first time in many many years. It all floods back just like the first rush that took them away.

I am an Anaesthesiologist in another country who has almost unlimited access to high purity opioids and fell into the pit of addiction to Meperidene then Alfentanil . That was seventeen years ago and apart from one month relapse eleven years ago, have been clean of that slavery. I reported myself to my Professional Body and for a year sent weekly urine for opiate testing to prove to the slanderers that was clean (my own idea) . I gave a lecture on chemical dependency to my clolleagues and have built a new life to put defences in place against relapse (I dont get cravings despite daily availability). I just do not want to become a slave to this substance ever again. After turning my car over and nearly overdosing, I learnt the lesson that any drug does not give you pleasure without demanding back that pleasure in opposite terms. You pay in so many ways for what you do not to mention your family and self respect being the biggest casualties lasting years. I work as a Doctor with different and more humble insights in what we use to relieve pain. I have watched at least four colleagues overdose and die from opiate abuse - it is a real and ongoing problem shrouded in secrecy and denial.The best defence is to as you have come out in the open and be totally truthful about the mistake and its often fatal consequences.The path to health must involve stronger alternatives to opiates that will make the latter choice to be far less attractive ...like strong friendships/family bonds , regular exercise further education and so forth. 
In your documentary what I noticed that there was little evidence of antiseptic skin preparation. That must lead to skin abscesses, loss of veins not to mention systemic problems like lung and heart valve infections.Even after my ruthless self exposure and abstinence, there are colleagues who will tell me that I have a 10 percent chance of recovery as recently as this year. As a former feedback person said, there are some people who will always be prejudiced and cruel. My two children both have stable good jobs with decent education and my wife has always been supportive. Looking around , Drug addiction is just one form of a spectrum of addictions. Some are addicted to sex, sport, money and even violence. That does'nt make Drug addiction any better as a choice as most of your contributors have said. Society will accept cigarette (Nicotine) addiction but in reality, hard core users go through withdrawal on abstinence apart from the damage they do to their health. Yet many will rant against harder substance abusers as if they are any better on the self destruction scale.""",1445997071.0

And over the last 5 years (and the last 3 since I switched from heroin to fentanyl)

- I can't sleep on any side besides my back, so basically I only sleep in 1 position, on my back, face up, arms to my sides...any other side brings me into a faster w/d.
- On heroin I actually had a huge appetite and gained weight, on fentanyl I almost became anorexic so I've been force feeding myself protein smoothies and now I'm OK but I'm worried its just water weight until I get my period and I'll go back to bones sticking out

- I can only stay asleep for 1.5-2 hours at a time, because I always have to get up and go to the bathroom, and do stuff...so I need at least 12 hours in a day dedicated to sleep.
- I have a pimple addiction, I'll drop everything to pop a pimple and collect the beans inside, even drop my hooter and foil to go to the mirror and pop!  Now I look like a meth junky because of all the scars but thank god for make-up covers it up perfectly.

- I have this intense issue with DRY hands and screeching dry noises (like nails on a chalkboard), like pulling tissue from tissue box or touching dry objects, I always need to put lotion on my hands because the dryness gives me the extreme chills.
- I've ruined my front teeth from smoking too much resin, even cracked a little tiny piece but I also smoke cigarettes

- I can't drink alcohol, or do any other drug besides this without getting extremely sick

The good things though is that it keeps me stable mentally from my bipolar disorder, AND I haven't aged in 15 years, I still look like how I did back in 8th grade and people are shocked when they find out my real age, I feel like it has slowed down my aging process.

Anyway, I just finished a month-long binge doing some insanely good dope that turned out to be, whaddya know, fentanyl. I did a urine test and it showed up positive for fent and heroin, but given the quality of the dope, I'm guessing most of the effects were from fent. Before this binge, I was doing 0.1-0.2g shots of okay dope, doing about .75-1g/day for a year. I went on subs for a couple weeks and then did 25 grams of this fent-laced dope over the course of about a month. At first, my shots were tiny -- they had to be like a fifth of a point or less. By the end I was shooting ten times that, dosing ten times a day and doing 1g-2g of this fent-laced stuff in a day. 

I'm back on subs for a little bit (holy shit, subs did not even touch the fent withdrawal until day 4! That was horrible). I was wondering if anyone here had experience jacking up their tolerance with unknown but high doses of fentanyl accidentally and then switching back to dope? I do plan on returning to dope after stabilizing on 1-2mg of Suboxone for a few weeks, but I'm concerned that instead of returning to my 1g/day habit I'll end up shooting 1g just for a high.

tuesday: middle for a good looking friend of mine, get compensated for it but not in a way that would get me well. boy from monday is looking again, i find a hook, everyone is happy. boy comes through at 6, supposed to meet my connect before 7. connect goes ghost, doesn't answer calls, picks up and hangs up, etc instead of having the courtesy to say that things didn't work out so i wouldn't keep calling her. while waiting, i break change for my boy and get back in the car completely walking over a fat wad of cash on the ground next to the fucking car that some motherfucker saw and picked up.

I've read on the internet that many don't get much from it, maybe some relaxation, a little buzz but no big deal. A friend of mine said I should take them both because I won't feel anything from 1 but it seemed too much.

Anyway, on Friday I got home at 3:40pm and took one. I waited an hour, two, I didn't feel much. I started listening to music and I lay in bed and stay there for some good thirty minutes. I realize I'm much more relaxed and then I notice this heat, coming right from my chest. It immediately reminded me of how you guys here describe heroin and opiates in general, like just coming inside after staying out, freezing and then just getting in bed, covering yourself and feeling that amazing heat.

I was astonished, the feeling was there on and on making me feel so great, I went out smoked a cigarette and everything seemed wonderful, talking with my friend and all. I went to sleep late at night and that's when I felt a little weird because I had trouble sleeping, it was like I was in a delirium, seeing things with eyes closed and twitching and turning. I have to mention that I have gotten about 5 hours of sleep per night in the last weeks.

When I woke up the next day, I still felt some little heat but I knew I had to take the other one to feel it full blown again. I took it and as I waited I thought that maybe it's just placebo but it came back. Again everything was great, I stood until 5 in the morning talking to some girl (sending pics and shit). I tried to masturbate, it took me two fucking hours and it was the shittiest orgasm I ever experienced, almost painful.

The third day, I woke up with no more inner heat or any feeling. I was a bit annoyed by it, well a bit more. What made my day shitty figuratively because if it was literal it would've been nice is that just from these two pills I got like a fucking blockade built in my butt.

I'm still thinking about it, what if it was placebo but I surely don't feel that relaxation and wonderful heat. It was a bit like being in love because I was energetic too. What do you guys think about what I just experienced? Was it placebo? What was with that rough sleep? I've experienced it just once before. And one more thing my pupils still don't seem to dilate as much as  before.

TL;DR: I had a blast with Trams but still some weird shit happened.

EDIT: I forgot to add something essential as I was walking on the streets waiting for some friends to come out, I felt amazing just thinking about how in love I am with Tramadol, this awesome girl. I remember staying on a bench and feeling it heating me from the inside and being so happy, smiling like a mad man at points. I couldn't stay for long though because I felt like I had to move.",1445981289.0

I don't abuse my meds or take anything else.  My pain management doctors have made many horrible mistakes in the past (one injected me with nubain for breakthrough pain that caused 8 hours of precipitated withdrawal hell.)

A new doc offered me buprenorphine when I was unable to get a methadone script filled and feared going into withdrawal, not to mention how would I handle the spine pain w/o methadone.  The doc offered me buprenorhpine.  He said it was NOT an opiate, but it would ""prevent me from going into withdrawal.""

I refused it, since a non opiate would've been useless for me.  Went home, researched and see it is indeed an opiate, and a partial at that.  

Given that methadone is a full agonist,  and the bup is a partial agonist/antagonist, what would've happened had I taken the buprenorphine? Would that have caused precipitated withdrawal just like the nubain had done?

My stool has been minorly difficult to pass and it never really feels satisfying when I do. Last night I took miralax and passed a small un satisfying stool yet again this morning.

I'm getting worried at this point as I've never had this happen before and have since, decided to stop taking any opiates .

The post about that manager that helped his employee go to rehab really blew me away. I have a very good job at a government facility... I will not state which, but I've been dealing with opiate addiction for about the last 8 years. There has hardly been a point in my life where I wasn't on some kind of opiate and I've done hella shady things to get my fix. I know I'm not alone in this and although I feel horrible for a lot of the things I did to acquire drugs, I know that I can't beat myself up over it. Recently I was diagnosed with sciatic even though I'm only 26. Karma decided to repay me by also cutting off my dope/opi supply right when that happened. I went to Detroit a few times to score some dope because the prescription pills I was used to were cut off and too expensive to continue taking. I did one last run to Detroit Sunday for $100 worth and finished it yesterday. I also cried to my dealer (whom I owe close to $450 too) about my back and he gave me 5 of the vic 7's. I can't keep living this way. I've put myself in so much debt, jeopardized my job and disappointed so many people. My question is as simple as it gets... How did you get off opiates? Did you use other substances like Kratom? Did you taper down, or go cold turkey? I will unfortunately have to go cold turkey because of money issues and if I have any form of opiate in my possession it's straight down the hatch, or up the nose for that matter. I can not be trusted. I just need help, any kind of help. I feel helpless and overpowered by these drugs and to top it off I'm in a lot of pain due to the sciatica. My doctor justly gave me muscle relaxers (only ten) but refused any opiates, despite every angle I tried. I just need any help, even if it is kind words. I swallowed the five pills my dealer gave me, knowing that I won't get high because my tolerance is super high and I could have saved them to taper... but again, I didn't. I just feel really lost and that post the manager made about helping his employee helped give me a little bit of hope that some people don't see me as just a helpless junkie. I want to recover, but I've wanted to recover so many times before. What was that final straw that made you quit? Any opinions on using Kratom?

First off, I am a proud weed smoker, I've experimented with other drugs, the hardest drug I've done but at the same time I'm not 100% on this but I smoked weed with coke on it that I got at a Crack house, if that wasn't coke then whatever. I've done whip its, codine, oxy, spice, salvia, and I just don't understand heroin. Like I've always seen it as a scary thing, like even now, I just watched a video of a guy oding like fuck man he was close to dying and yet he will still probably shoot up the next day. I have zero intentions of trying heroin but fuck man. I understand it is addictive but that guy was hanging on to life as he slowly leaned back with a blank stair on his pale face, lips blue and he said he could have painlessly slipped into death happily. Like what the fuck?? What is the high like? Sorry if I offended anyone but I've never seen the hype behind heroin or meth or even bath salts I mean unless you actually want to be a zombie lol but for real someone explain the high, the hype, and why you continue doing it knowing you become reckless and are so close to slipping away from your loved ones. I'm not really here to preach I'm not really that kinda person unless I really really feel like I want to let people know how I feel, which isn't often. So like I said can some one tell me what the high is like, why you continue to use, what made you start, what the hype is. Thank you and again sorry if in some way I offended someone 
And always remember there is someone who loves you. If you think you are alone, there is someone for you. 
If you use this because of depression or something like that I'm sorry but take a look at where you are in your life and think about what are you are doing.",1446109154.0

Ok, so to answer my own question, yes and that would be crack cocaine. I used it about 10 years ago (prior to ""finding"" heroin) off and on for a little bit. Well while using it I rarely had anything around for the come-down (don't know why as this was just torture) but the next day your pretty much a zombie and its very uncomfortable. However there was one time, and I can only barely remember it, but I must have gotten some pretty high grade shit, well better then what I was used to, and took my normal large hit off it. Held it in as long as I could and let it out.... Well talk about a bell-ringer... OMG! Room spinning... TOO FUCKED UP... yes, you read that right, too high... as in Oh SHIT, I can't handle this....

Well since your reading this now I obviously DID handle it, and I know that ever after that happened I still smoked that for a little while (few months) and then just stopped. I don't know how I did it, I sure as FUCK wish I could apply whatever happened then to now to kick h, but I don't know. Like I said I just stopped, I think I just smoked weed a bit afterwards and then I was fine. No cravings. As I write this now, not only to I obviously have zero... cravings for crack, I'm fucking disgusted by even thinking about it. Even typing this I feel a bit uncomfortable. Not that this is a bad thing, not in the least. Its one less drug I have to worry about getting hooked on.

Also just going by my appearance I don't look like I would have used drugs. What I mean is I don't have any visible track marks, hell I never injected anyway, H was my nose candy. How else do I convince the doc. Do I have to go out and get high just to pass the piss test, just to get the help I need? Seems a little backwards if you ask me. ",1446072535.0

So a little background information about me...im a college addict at a big time university trying to kick. My family and close friends know about my habit and they have been pretty supportive and helpful in my time of need. I'm currently 8 days sober and feeling pretty good.

Last night I was looking through my family's medicine cabinet to find some benadryl to help me sleep when I found a fairly large, still sealed old bottle of codeine syrup hidden in the back. Immediately, my junkie demons started whispering in my head for me to snatch it, guzzle it all down, throw on some DJ Screw and drift off into (relatively weak, but awesome nonetheless) blissful opiate euphorialand. However, my mom was in the next room and may have seen me take it so I decided against it.

For the rest of the night and most of today, I weighed the pros and cons of taking the codeine and enjoying one last nod. I am coming off of a little over a year of heavy oxycontin, opana, and heroin use, and as a result my grades, motivation, sex drive, and general desire to live have all greatly deteriorated. I ultimately decided that the codeine would set back my sobriety immensely (I am fully aware that ""last"" nods are hardly/if ever actually last nods), so I just threw the codeine in the trash while my dad was in the kitchen. He asked what I was doing and I responded that I couldn't have such easy access to opiates around me, and he proceeded to yell at me for fucking up my life and even considering drinking the syrup. 

I know I did the right thing, but my dad made me feel like such scum. I know most people are pretty ignorant in regards to opiates (my father included) so I had to vent my story to people who understand where i'm coming from. 

Thanks again to everyone in this community for being such fucking real and awesome people. I'm sure I speak for many fellow lurkers when I say that this board and all of its members are truly appreciated.",1446071861.0

So last night was a rather mild night. None of us got too fuckered up last night. No crazy benzos. It was rather enjoyable minus the fist fight we broke up. 

So this morning a few of us have our alarms set for 8:30am as we had an early run to make. Gross, right? Well we were really delayed.

I wake up and fix myself a nice, warm shot. I'm all nice and fuzzy when I want a cigarette. I'm looking for my shoes and they're gone. Huh. Must have left them upstairs. Nope. Now Mexican 1 is awake and he's also looking for his kicks. Negative. Weird. Mexican number 2 is having the same issue. Now, what's weird about this, is we can't find ANY of our shoes. So there's about 10 pairs missing. What the fuck. Mexican 1 automatically accuses people of stealing them. But it doesn't make sense because my house shoes, and VERY mangled DCs are missing. You couldn't sell them for a fucking crack rock. Fuck. 

We tear the house apart and around 9am Mexican 3 walks in. He was gonna ride with us but wasn't here yesterday. 

""Uhh guys? Why the hell are there a bunch of fucking shoes in front of the house?""

Wut. All of us go outside and there are our shoes. FUCKING FINALLY. Except they're only the left shoes. And those shoes are fucking ice cold. Dammit. 

We ponder about this situation and hunt all over for our righties. They were in the fucking box freezer. Some asshole stole all of our shoes and frozen them. WHY. We live in the mfucking Midwest and its cold as fuck here. And I wasn't putting cold shoes on. They were stuff and I think ice was forming.

I take my blow dryer and get to defrosting my shoes. It actually worked pretty well. I would have put them in the dryer but we don't have one right now. The blow dryer did wonders after a good solid 10 minutes. I apparently was the only one with a good idea.

As I walk out of the bathroom, I hear really pissed off Spanish. And smell something awful. Like a locker room. It's too damn early for this fucking shit but I inquire anyways. Before I can even ask, I see a melted shoe on the kitchen counter. Like, the sole had melted and warped. Oh god. 

*""wut the fuck happened to that shoe?""*

"" YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO MY 200 DOLLAR FUCKING SHOE? FUCKFACE OVER HERE TOLD ME ITD BE QUICKER TO MICROWAVE THEM TO WARM THEM UP.""

*""you... .  put....  Rubber? In the microwave??""*

Mexican 2 is cracking the fuck up and Mexican 1 is furious. 

2: ""ESE I said you COULD I never said you SHOULD.""

*""I'm really trying to understand the mistake you made here, but my brain is literally not processing why you'd heat rubber up for five fucking minutes.""*

2: ""it was a fucking joke and when I came back from the car, it was too late.""

*""you left him unattended after telling him this? I don't know who is fucking stupider.""*

Needless to say, its been over and hour and were not even home anymore and he's STILL bitching about microwaving his own shoes.

I've recently gotten a sub script (8mg bupe / 2mg nalt strips) but I'm not getting ""clean"" til January. Still use BTH in between sub doses when I want/can. I'd say my tolerance to get high/just about nod(even though I don't nod off BTH, ever) is about .4g of the ""good stuff"", or like 3-4 bags of some solid ECP.

Only reason I shot this was because I didn't take my sub earlier today(took an 8mg strip both yesterday at noon and noon the day before, didn't feel sick at all today/tonight) but I was fiiiieeenndddiiinngggg the fuck out to get high. I don't know why, probably because I didn't take my sub, but holy shit I would of let someone scream into my ass for hours or scream into their ass for a bit just to get a fix. Random because I usually don't ""fiend"". Plus, sublingual typically just makes me feel meh.  Not that I expect it to get me high or anything, but I hardly eat, feel depressed/down, etc when I take the suboxone normally. 

So I prepped about 4mg in a spoon with about 85ml of room temp water. Let sit for about 5 minutes(longer than needed really), mixed up a bit with the tip of a knife. I sadly only have cotton, so I used that to filter. Shot about 75ml. Didn't feel any rush or anything. Then felt, idk how to describe it, just weird. Slightly like when you're halfway to heroin in a pill addiction and you take your 70mg hydro or whatever, that feeling like 30 seconds before you feel the warmth of getting high. Was not euphoric at all however. 

It did, however, 10000% stop the cravings, and I am pretty content/happy. Wasn't hungry before(last meal was about 12 hours ago and not very big), shot up, 15 minutes later the ""high""(not much of one, but better than nothing) set in, then I was eating a fairly full meal in 30 minutes.

Idk how true it is, but I read that IVing it basically makes it last longer(by ""it"" I mean the ""not getting sick for a while"" factor that suboxone, well bupe, has), so if I end up getting black in the next 24 hours i'll update with whether I got high or not. When I take an 8mg strip orally, just for one day, I can get a lil high after about 12 hours, and fully high by 18-24 hours. If I take it a few days in a row, I usually have to wait 24 hours but not much longer to get high.

So yeah...I used the search bar prior to see what /r/opiates had to offer in terms of info on the subject and I didn't find a ton and iirc most of the posts are a lil old now anyway(not that it really matters, the formula for suboxone didn't change or anything I don't think...)

Any other sub IV'ers? I do NOT plan to do this often. If I don't get black tomorrow i'm gonna try shooting 8mg, then only using it when having severrrreee cravings, or if IVing makes the suboxone effect last longer, IVing when I am low on suboxone. We'll see.

EDIT: even though I shouldn't have to say this since if you're using subs you should do your research/know this already, but for the n00bs : DO NOT USE SUBOXONE IN ANY FORM UNLESS YOU HAVEN'T USED ANY OPIATE FOR AT LEAST 24 HOURS. For some people, it's less time, for a few i'm sure it's more. I can't tell you how many pure unadulterated fucking idiots I read while researching IVing sub tonight that said more or less ""Hurrr I IV'd 1mg sub and I instantly went into W/D! Don't try it man!

As I walk into this house, I see a beautiful mid twenty year old woman on the floor, my friend over the top of her trying to wake her up. Her hands and lips were purple, eyes rolling around aimlessly. I immediately run to the bathroom and turn on a cold bath. I tell my friend that we need to carry her in there to try and shock her out of this.

We drag her into the bathroom. We start spalshing the water on her face and pumping her chest. She's coming in and out of consciousness now. My friend starts giving her cpr, she starts taking in huge gasps of air and grabs my arm extremely tight, I'm ecstatic to know that she still has some fight in her.

After a few more minutes of cpr and splashing cold water on her face and chest, she comes to and sits up on her own. Come to find out, she only insufflated a $10 pack, I've never seen somebody drop like this and didn't think it could happen that easily without using iv administration.

Me and my friends think this is a result of fent laced dope. She was only out for a good 20 minutes. I felt good about what we did but I feel we really should have called 911.

However, I'm noticing that I really can't even get high on this shit anymore. I have snorted 4 G76s (15mg x 4 = 60mg) and I'm well, but not anywhere near where I would want and expect to be at this dosage and cash expenditure. 

Anyone else ruin their favorite pharms because an H habit has pushed their tolerance through the roof? Also, what has your experience been with H and oxymorphone dosage conversion?

Had a surgery a few years ago and re blew the disc out last year. I've been going to a pain clinic here in Florida and I see the doctor every two months. He always gives me 90 hydro for 30 days and 1 refill for the same. 

So last month we decided I should see a neural specialist as the pain is getting worse and worse. So I did. After talking with the surgeon we decided to operate.

The operation happened on the same day as my normal refill for the hydro so I didn't fill it because I knew the surgeon would prescribe something better. So needless to say the neural surgeon have me a script for Oxy. Then the following week gave me a script for Oxy again. Every 10 days I get a script for 10 days worth of Oxy. But each week it's less and less. This week I decided to fill the hydro script for 90 pills since it was only 15 days after the ""do not fill before"" date in the hydro prescription.

So my question is. Since I have a script for 10 days of Oxy but I just filled a script for 30 days of hydro, can I fill
The Oxy in 30 days since it was dated for today's date? How late can I fill a script after its' date? I live in Florida and use Walgreens if that helps at all. Thanks! :) ",1446149485.0
