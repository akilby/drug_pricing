And what would you do if you found out a younger sibling and/or their friends were using opiates?","I'm curious because my younger brother and his friends have mentioned taking Vicodin, taking morphine, snorting oxys and talking about how much they like the feeling and the high, a couple of them have mentioned it's even better then weed. I'm just sitting here confused and a bit afraid about what to do, I don't want him making the same mistakes I did. I also do not want to ignore it completely. 

  My brother knows I use but not how much I actually use, I never ever give him any drugs and never use around him or his friends and his friends do not know I use and I plan to keep it that way. I don't condone minors using opiates but I don't want to be the buzz kill/ass hole older sister. 

  I'm thinking about sitting my brother down for a talk about the dangers of using prescription pills/opiates, which will include how easily addictive they are, how much trouble he'll get in if he gets caught, showing him statistics on overdoses, and informing him how to use in the safest manner. If I can't stop him from experimenting I can at least prevent harm right? 

  If the situation escalates I will have no choice but to tell our parents and his friends parents but right now I think it's just a faze where teenagers are starting to experiment with other substances besides cannabis.

  If you have anything to add or any advice on how I should handle this situation it's much much appreciated, if it helps he's 17 and I'm 21. Thank you all very much in advance.

Tl;dr: Found out younger brother and his friends have been using prescription pills/opiates, don't want to be the buzz kill older sibling.

After a while its just life, you can’t live with the drugs.. but you can’t live without them even more. We get high because the world’s uncomfortable, uninteresting and unbearable. Always.

So when your friend notices the track marks you’ve been attempting to conceal with long sleeve shirts and jackets, simply tell them this; we get high to cope or to forget, we get high to think or to stop thinking, we get high to relate to others or maybe we don’t want to relate at all. We get high to fit in, or we get high because we’ve blended in too much. We get high to feel something, and sometimes to feel nothing at all. But most of all we get high because we’re empty, and we’re empty because we’re missing something.. the key to being a functional member of society. We don’t possess what’s required to be, like them. We’re just desperately trying to survive in their world, because it certainly isn’t ours. We’re trying to function, think and behave.. the way the rest of them do.

Except with our irregular pupils, our track marks and slurred speech, we still aren’t very functioning. And yet multiple times a day I’m able to easily convince myself that my blacked out eyes, my shaky hands, my slow beating heart and my slowed state of mind have absolutely no effect on how well I’m able to function in society. All of the things I tell myself are fallacies, but I’m capable of believing them regardless.

Hydrocodone
Strength 1 for 10mg B/A ≥80%

Morphine (oral)
Strength 1 for 10mg B/A ≈25%

Does that mean you'd have to take over 3 times the amount of morphine to equal the strength of hydrocodone?

Or is morphine 3 x as strong but it equals out the same per mg because of B/A?

Also Morphine (IV/IM) [not caring to address that IV would have to be stronger than IM right now.]

strength 3 for 3.33 mg with 100% B/A

Because of the injected morphine being listed as stronger, I'm guessing that the B/A is factored into the strength rating in this chart.  The only other explanation I have is that the chart is wack (it is wikipedia).

Edit: for anyone who hasn't already seen it on the sidebar, [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_comparison) is what I'm referring to

","It's 4 AM. Opiate withdrawal insomnia has me in the thralls, and with nothing else to do, I figured I owed you guys at least this. 5 years ago, I was a 17 year old kid with nothing to lose and everything to gain. I had my wisdom teeth out, and I discovered in the little white pill that I was prescribed for pain, what I had been searching for all my life. 

Relief. Relief from the constant buzz of anxiety, the constant hurt from I'm not sure what. Whatever ached me then, it pains in comparison to what aches me now. As time went on, I ran out of those, but got more, and more. I found it very easy to get what I wanted out of the drug dealers in the white coats. 

By 19, I was going strong, mixing opiates, benzos, and alcohol, all while maintaining a full time job, and going to school full time. Then 20 hit. 

I found the harder drugs, the better ROAs. My life spiraled from a seemingly decent existence, to revolving around one thing. The high. That feeling of ""yeah, shit's still the same, but man isn't it awesome?"". My relationship crumbled. I lost my job. I flunked out of school. And did this lady care? Nope. I had what I needed. 

Finally, my parents had ENOUGH and shipped my butt off to rehab. And it worked, for a while. 9 months clean. 9 months. Doesn't seem like long to most people, but in this 5 years, it's the longest I've ever been able to stay away. It was a good 9 months. I'm not sure what made me go back.

But I did. It started out slow, here and there, I was able to pick it up and put it down again, how awesome is that?!? I guess I thought I was immune to this. Immune to catching the bug, and not being able to let it go. 

Well I wasn't. In the past year, I've chipped, and I've had fun. But it's not chipping anymore. I may not be a constant user, but I definitely have a problem. In the past month, living has become difficult, but at the same time, I've found a reason I want to do just that. Live. So, for the umpteenth time, I try to tell the opiates goodbye. 

I'll still be around, I love you guys, I'm not planning on leaving here. Just wanted to let you know that my love affair with opiates may be finally over.

I bet you thought this was gonna be about Gil. Made you look.

We all know that the absolute maximum amount of morphine per 1 ml of water is 60 mg. That being said, I have one friend who claims that putting any more than two 30 mg morphine IRs into a spoon is a waste. He finely crushes two pills, adds his water (I believe about 150 units, or 1.5 ml), lets it sit for ten minutes, then draws and shots.

Guy number two uses four of the same pills for 120 mg and about 3.2 ml of water.

Lastly, the third individual uses ten pills for 300 mg and 5.5-ish ml of water for his preparation.

*(With the exception of guy number one, in an effort to get out every bit of the goodies, they all end up with multiple shots/washes, but that doesn't really factor into this question, so let's continue...)*

Now each person claims that their way is the best. Personally, I've always wondered what the perfect ratio of number of pills to milliliters of water really is too. I've been known to try each combination (plus others), and I have my own personal favorites, but I would kill to find out how to get that perfect match of morphine to water, just so I can one, have the strongest possible shot, and two, be absolutely certain I haven't wasted one precious, precious milligram.

I've got a few questions about Loperamide amounts and WDs.,"**Edit**: I'm very sorry, I did not mean for this thread to become an argument with BroadStreet_Bully2 but it seems it has. I do not read, comment on, or post to /r/opiates to cause arguments, but some were angry with things that were said in the comments section here. Perhaps I'll try my Loperamide question again at a later time, until then I will remain fully aware of the subreddit rules (none were broken) and maintain my aspiration to post good/informative posts/comments or thought provoking questions... or to seek advice and to give it as asked. Stay safe everyone and I do thank /r/opiates for being what it is to me (most of the time). Thanks! And if anyone else *could* answer my original question that would be great!

When I WD from opiates, I tend to get the GI symptoms really fast and pretty badly. Because of this, I always make sure to have some Loperamide HCl around. I just picked up a box of 144 2mg Lopes the other day.

How do you take them? & what is safe? I hear a lot that they help for WDs (and they do for me) by binding to your mu-opioid receptors in your GI tract.

What amounts do you take and how often? At first I tried taking one or two at a time, that didn't work, neither did three or five. 10 at a time, 3 - 4 times a day seems to work very well, and doesn't leave me constipated or anything. I just end up * almost normal* gastrointestinally at that point. I do this about once or twice a week on average, though sometimes I won't need to take any for a few weeks at a time. I'm just wondering if this is safe. I suspect needing so many at once has to do with my general opiate tolerance. I have been doing this for a few months now (only when WDing) and have noticed zero negative side-effects whatsoever. It's made the physical part of WDs *much* more tolerable, especially the *horrible* stomach cramps. But am I doing any damage in the long run?",1357276304.0

I find they are incredibly weak in comparison with other pills.  For instance, it takes around 90mg (9 pills) for me to be in the zone (whether I snort/eat doesn't matter).  However, if I take three 30mg pills I feel the effects of the oxy are much stronger (whether it be A's, Mbox's, V's).  So even though the doses are equivalent my pills feel much weaker.  Does anyone else know why this is and also hate these KVtech pills?  Anyone know if they need to be crushed to even finer powder than normal to work better?  Or any suggestions on how to get more out of these pills?

even though i'm exhausted i can't fall asleep until really late at night. i have also been taking a blue or two at night before i sleep and i'm sure that can't help since oxy is sort of an uppity opiate.

also, with the xanax, is it a better idea to take like .25 mg for a few more nights? stop cold turkey? hold off on taking any until i feel a lot of anxiety and take a small amount like a 1/4 of a .50 mg pill? 

i fucked up with the xanax because i was going through opiate w/d i took too many and i'm suffering the consequences for being a dumbass but with all this overlap it's hard to know what's what.

My parents are very foreign and strict, so something like this would not go over well with them. I feel like most parents, while still being angry, would be supportive in their children getting help with an addiction. Mine would probably disown me or probably keep me on lock down. I also feel as though I cannot open up to my best friend about my use of pills because we had an old friend die from a heroin overdose earlier in the year. She knows I use sometimes but she does not know how often because anytime I try to bring it up she gets extremely angry and I feel attacked. The only person that knows the full extent of my use is my ex boyfriend, and even that is not helpful because we do not talk as much as we used to. Since I feel like I cannot talk to anyone about what I go through I have to try extremely hard to keep it a secret from everyone. However lately I have been so focused on getting high that I keep slipping up and becoming careless at hiding my secret life. I used to have it under control but I feel myself slipping away a little.

I am wondering, will the pharmacy deny filling the script for wednesday because I should still have more than enough left (which in reality I am completely out now and am starving off WD with Lope)? I am planning on going to a different pharmacy with the hope that if that happens, I will just deny that I received 90 tabs and that it must be some sort of computer/input mistake and hope that if any digging is done it is harder to figure out going through a totally different pharmacy. Do you think I will have any problems to begin with because I do have post dated scripts or do you think if a problem arises saying it must be an error will work out? I am kinda stuck here... if things work out, ok then, no problem... but if I am denied and I raise awareness to the situation I may be cut off entirely, or at least told I have to wait an X amount of time/days till my script can be used which in that case I might as well just detox myself because that is just about what I am doing now with the lope.

For less than $1000 you can get an all inclusive vacation that covers your flights, food, drinks and a hotel for 7-10 days and you're at the source of these drugs.

One time I bought weed at the store in Mexico, and they threw in two free bags of cocaine - that's how cheap it is there. I just flushed it, as I'm more of a drinker, but you get my point. I've heard you can buy a *pound* of pure heroin for ~$1500USD in some of these countries.

Everything was fine and normal, but about five hours later I was running a fever of 104. Since then I've taken acetaminophen and ibuprofen to get my fever down, but it never broke and its still around 101-102 degrees.

At first I thought it was cotton/trash fever, but when I get CF it starts sooner than five hours post-shot and only lasts about an hour. CF also gives me violent shakes and that freezing feeling, but this fever hasn't done that at all. Furthermore, I split the spoon with a friend and she reported no fever, CF or otherwise.

Everything was as sterile as it usually is, and there's no weird reaction at the injection site. The only thing that was different was the brand of MSContin I used. Its still Mallinckrodt, but instead of the box-M imprint, this pill is much larger and imprinted with MS 100.

Has anyone else experienced something like this? I think my fever is breaking now because I'm starting to feel better and I'm sweating like a fat man's balls on a summer day, but I don't really want to fuck around with this shit if I can expect a brain-frying fever every time I boot these pills.

In my area heroin is completely unheard of. Its insane considering I'm between two large cities on the I-10 corridor, but never mind. Because of the absence of H, pills sell for a ridiculous amount. If you think a buck a milligram for Roxicodone is expensive, try fifty cent for each milligram of morphine or five to seven dollars a milligram for hydromorphone.

So, because of the situation and the rampant demand for opiates, I'm working on the idea of buying a few grams of heroin from the Silkroad and selling it to my more trusted and discerning customers. I've been told that when its around (maybe twice a year) is sells for about sixty dollars for a bag, with the bag's strength being comparable to an MSContin 100. Obviously that heroin is stepped on to fuck and back if .10 is comparable to at best 60mg of morphine in a rig. If I'm going to do this I want to be able to offer a better bag than what has previously been around - especially if I'm asking people to drop fifty or sixty bucks for a fucking point of dope.

Now I used to cut the ""raw"" I would cop in Chicago, but that was for personal use and it was still strong enough that if any of my current customers shot it I'd seriously worry about them falling out. In the Windy City cut was always Dormin or Sleepinal, which is just a branded diphenhydramine sleep-aid. It completely dissolved in water, but every other diphenhydramine I've experimented with leaves quite a bit of residue behind.

So anyway, my long winded ass has finally come to my question... If you had to pick a cut, what would you rather be in your heroin? As a follow up, what do you think is the magic ratio of heroin to cut to ensure a profit for the dealer and a good high for the user?

I recently learned about PST and am experimenting with it ease my withdrawal symptoms for this most recent attempt at getting clean, at least for a month or so while my symptoms are somewhat inactive.

Is this a bad idea?  From what I have read PST and PPT take longer to withdraw from due to it's metabolization rate compared to other opiates, like oxy witch, is in comparison short acting, and is metabolized quickly, thus making it worse than other opiates to drop.

I have been using opiates for now about two and a half years in the last month I have shot up for my first time.

Also I have never shot up by myself before is it really dangerous to do so? My tolerance is very high like 3-4 roxies at one time to get a decent high is how high my tolerance is so im not worried about over doing it.  I have roxies as well as Heroin are roxies ok to shot up?

I've recently taken a percocet and some oxycodone (5mg, so that's a total of 10mg) and I am feeling NO effects. This is the first time I've used any kind of narcotic, so I shouldn't have a tolerance. However I do take prescribed benzodiazepines and I'm not sure if there is a cross tolerance.

Can anyone help me out? I'm desperate here. I have access to a lot of percocet, a few oxycodone pills, and some hydrocodone. I also have xanax, ativan, and klonopin. I'm not looking to get high (though I wouldn't mind it) I just need to make this pain go away. They drilled into my jaw on both sides and this is all I can think about. I've been coping with NO pain relief for two days and I just can't handle it anymore.

I figured that if anyone can help it would be you guys. My dentist doesn't seem to understand how bad I feel or that the medicine isn't having any effect.

Update: turns out I have a bacterial infection in my jaw and another medicine I take interferes with opiates. It's going to be a shitty week. Thank you for all of the help and reassurance. I know this isn't the normal kind of post here, but you've been awesome and much more helpful than my dentist or doctor.

I Read that they are real if you can scratch some of it off with a fingernail, which did work. They smell almost like a starch or if anyone remembers what the old opana 20s smelt like when you snorted them, its the exact same smell.

If anyone has any experience with these, and knows how to tell a real from a fake i would really appreciate it.

This is why I've come here.
So, as many of you, my fellow bropiates, may know, the OP 20 oxy's are made out of this sort of ""abuse-proof"" pseudo-gel/powder material. The only way to crush them up is through a crisping method or dissolving in a (acidic, I believe but correct me f I'm wrong) beverage.
So I was just grnding up an herb in my herb grinder and thought about trying to crush the OP 20 pills in it, seeing as it's made of a pretty tough metal. I, however, realize that these pills are designed very well, and would like to prevent my grinder from being pulverized.
So, do you guys have any input or advice?
Thanks,

I ask this because my tolerance is getting up there. At around a half gram to get where I want. I feel like the amount of powder I need to inhale at this point must be fucking my nostrils at least a little. Definitely less hair in there compared to a year ago lol.

If one can attain pure heroin (which I know is virtually impossible to get on the street), a clean needle, (or however else one chooses to use) and uses an amount that will get you pleasantly high without fear of an overdose, what are the long term effects? 

If there are other drugs considered dangerous for similar reasons– not necessarily detrimental but highly addictive or easy to do wrong– please let me know.

Won't be able to get Mbox anymore and I think I might lose my mind. I have ONE ABG and don't want to fuck this up. Please help.


Suggest Method from Bluelight:

""1 3ml syringe Iuse a 25 to 28ga needle
A tablespoon. (for doing one pill, if 2 or more a shot glass works)
cotton balls 
H20 with added salt or saline solution. 
(I use salt water. doesnt take much. you just want to be able to taste the salt) 
The salt water helps along with the heat to break down the time release matrix.

Notice.... no candle.

Wash the coating off as I said for the mallies. Set the pill aside. Draw up about 2mls of salt water per pill. 

Wad up 2 cotton balls, then crush up the pill finely. 
Place the powder in your spoon or if more than one into a shot glass. Expel the salt solution over the powder and mix. Let it sit for about 10 minutes, then draw it up. Add a bit more and do it again. 

It's that easy. For some ungodly reason the salt keeps the pill from gelling up! If you find that after it sits it has gelled and is hard to draw up just add a bit more and mix. Then draw it up. You'l notice after you draw it up that you get a really strong morphine taste. (as you do with all these methods, I always taste after the 1st draw no matter what. You'll know when you have a strong product) This is the only cold extraction method Ive used where I can actually get that pin and needle rush from a small amount of morph. I've done it with other brands this way, without the salt water which extracted the drug and worked, but I got no rush when i shoot it.""",1358370731.0

He says yes and i buy him a beer while i check in. Come down to him hovering over my car excited to help me, too much so really.

He asks if i know who Devin the dude is, being a middle aged white guy he didnt think I would. To his chagrin i chime in I know his music well and rap to Zeldar. He then tells me he is Devins brother and insists on calling him from my phone, however only Devins answering service picked up but it did appear to be Devins phone. Then brother lets me know i need to buy him $10 worth of wet before he could find my DOC for the night. We drive around for an hour with him spazzing out talking weird shit and turning the radio up literally up as high as possible. Finally after going back and forth in circles we end up in a scary ass hood and park the car. He tried really hard to leave his shoe with me, i had just given him $10 and promised not to leave him. He stood in the middle of the road for like 5 minutes just looking around while i am freaking out. I am waaay out of place here especially this late and its obvious to anyone why i am there. Finally he walks around the corner and as soon as he is out of sight i go back home. I felt bad for leaving him but at least he got high for free and had both shoes!

Pushing at that spot hurts like a miss/skin pop, or maybe an arterial injection, but I'm 90% sure its not missing and the shot I just did right before didn't hurt like an arterial shot or produce the reaction IV-ing into an artery would.

What the fuck is going on? My friend is convinced its an artery and what I just injected is sitting around in that spot like some fat fuck waiting for a bus. Another friend thinks I missed the first shot and I'm registering the drugs that are sitting subcutaneously. 

I tried explaining to them that neither of those explanations are physically possible because one, shit in a vein or artery wouldn't stick around long enough for me to pull it back up, and two, pulling back something that's subcutaneous wouldn't produce a register, but apparently my friends think that blood goes through your body in nice, neat, orderly rows or something... I need smarter friends. *sigh*

So... Any ideas?

Thanks all.

**TL;DR - Odd reaction while doing multiple shots back-to-back has me and my retarded junkie friends fucking stumped. The best answer will get a prize!**

(Wall of Text Ahead.)","TL;DWR: New doctor writes me a prescription for 60x30mg Oxycodone every 2 weeks and 60x60mg Oxycontin OC's every month, even though I've never received opiates for pain treatment. 

Recently I've been experiencing more and more pain in both my knees. When I was younger, I was in an accident when a bleacher I was sitting on collapsed, crushing, and pinning both my legs underneath it. This happened when I was 15 and it caused some problems as I grew. Anyways, I'm in my mid 20's now and I have only ever received 600mg Ibuprofen for my pain, besides the initial strong medication when the accident happened. This resulted in me having to seek out medication from some shady people, in some shady places. But today, that all changed. I went to a new doctor that my shrink recommended, and when I got there, he offered me a doughnut and sat down to talk to me. Instead of going straight into an examination, we discussed my hobbies, job, family, and all that. Right off the bat I had a good feeling about this doctor. It seemed as though he was likely to actually treat my symptoms, not just worry about covering his ass at the expense of my continued pain. Anyways, we went over using opiate pain medication for the treatment of pain, and I played as dumb as I could. I told him I'd had medication called Vicodin after the initial injury, but that even as a 15 year old, it wasn't very strong and offered limited relief. So he said he'd start me on something a little stronger. He shook my hand and told me to go back to the waiting room. I sat out there while he called in a prescription and then he gave me a script sheet. When I started reading it, my eyes opened wider than they ever have and it took every ounce of concentration, focus, and determination not to start jumping around and cheering. Now, i get 60 of [These](http://i.imgur.com/vnXn6.jpg) every 2 weeks for a grand total of $8.46 cents per month. I also get 30 of the 60mg OC's (the little red crushable ones, but I don't think I'm gonna fill that script yet because my insurance will only pay for one narcotic pain medication at a time, go figure.) I know I'm lucky to be getting the 30's, and the 60's for the matter, right at the beginning of my treatment. 

Oh yeah I forgot to mention above. On the way out of his office upon giving me the scrip, he told me to, and I quote, ""Have Fun!"" He's a pretty cool dude.

(I just witnessed a true ""worst day ever"")","Im sorry to be a bother, but I feel partially responsible (not truly as he would have found out eventually) for instigating what is surely a friend's ""worst day ever.""   As someone who has my own very real ""worst day ever"" (as many of us do) I want to try and at least help with information.
 A little story, but I really need information/help from those that know some legal stuff.  I know a bit, but have never actually been there.  First off I want to say R.I.P. to a good brope and friend of mine that passed away on the 14th of January.  He was a good dude, and had nearly 8 months clean.  He told me he would be coming back to town from a long term rehab after Christmas and we should kick it.  I never heard from him and didn't think much of it.  I had a lot on my plate being clean, and I assume he did as well getting back from long term rehab.  Another kid I knew called me and informed me he had died, and that his funeral is tomorrow.  I was bummed needless to say.  When my girlfriend died of an overdose this kid was really there for me, and so was our other buddy (we were like pees in a pod in a rehab years bacl..ahh rehab friends :) )  The buddy that is still alive and the departed are some of the few people that still talked to me when I was homeless for nearly a year through the Chicago winter and all. Brutal. so I really appreciate these peoples.  He is still using heavily so I don't see him much, but I texted him to tell him about the death and the funeral.  He's already having the worst day of his life as he is on day 3 withdrawal, and when he hears about the death he is crushed.  Then I get a text saying he saw him recently.  THEN I get a text saying ""Fuck dude, I have texts and I hooked him up with shit at like 9:30 pm on Jan 13th"" (the night before the day they found him dead)  Then he tells me his dad just informed him that earlier when he was out detectives from the town where our friend died stopped by his house looking for him. Obviously, they went through our deceased friends phone. 

My buddy is fucking freaked right now, and on the worst guilt trip of his life. While I do think it's kind of fucked up he would give drugs to someone for their relapse after 8 months clean, the kid was a repeatedly relapsing Junky like both of us. He's an adult, and not a minor either. Also, It's possible our departed friend may have already relapsed.  My living friend didn't fill the shot with too much dope and stick it in the other friends arm, so I don't blame him, but that's not how he sees it obviously. He hates himself right now.   I was wondering if anyone has any idea what he is in for.  When my girl passed no one as prosecuted, but the family didn't want to press charges for one.  Is the state able to press if the family doesn't want to?  What if the texts don't say anything about drugs specifically, but use a lot of typical drug code, or no code but just ""let's get together"" type stuff.  Is he fucked for having admitted it to me?   Sorry I'm on a super shitty computer and in a rush, but if I need to clarify more just ask, and for all y'all out there try and send a little one second good vibe to my deceased buddy, his hurting family, and my other buddy having the worst day ever right now.

TL;DR  I had two good friends A and B.  A died, and I texted B to tell him, and B is freaking out, because he thinks he supplied friend A with the dope that killed him.  There is possible text message evidence on both their phones. What are possibilities? What can he expect?",1358486185.0

This, you could say, this is just as much of a genuine problem as it is my way of introducing myself to the community (which, understandably, has trouble being forthcoming let alone responsive to PMs from a person they've never heard of/seen post..).

I've been using opiates on more than off for years and have recently found myself in the unfortunate situation of being unable to regularly connect with anyone who has anything I want.  I'm not in any sort of dire straits here or faced with the threat of withdrawal, but to maintain my sanity and keep myself from doing anything too stupid, I've been resorting to buying Kratom caps from a local head shop.  

I have trouble really describing the feeling I get from them.. because I'm not really sure if it exists.  Most likely, whatever it is that I think is happening inside of me is fully a placebo effect.  I acknowledge that I don't exactly feel sober, but its not..... really..... anything.   Anyhow, I'm not soliciting anything here, I'm just curious is anyone has any tips on what they do during extreme droughts..

I will say, that I do spend a pretty hefty amount of my 'play money' (money left over after bills) on scoring a few blues, but never put the usage above my means. 

I guess I am just a victim of the war on drugs... I, by all rights, should be prescribed pain medication for two injuries, but Drs around here are VERY leery of prescribing anything, and I've been told more than once that ""you are too young to be prescribed pain medications (I am 26), yes they will certainly help you, but it won't cure your injuries"" I've had numerous MRI's, Xrays, Ultrasounds, and even physical therapy, but nothing can help the pain, or diagnose why it is occuring. I've spent beaucoup bucks on medical bills just trying to figure out the problem and get a scrip, but to no avail. At best I've gotten some muscle relaxers, lame ass lidocaine patches, anti-depressants, nerve blockers, everything under the sun that isn't a pain pill.

16uyfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/16uyfv/something_everyone_here_should_know_about/,5,https://redd.it/16uyfv,belovely,"Something everyone here should know about Addiction. If you are just getting into opiates, or you are a full blown addict, you should be made aware of this information.","The way addiction works is that it enters into your survival hierarchy. Essentially ""EAT, KILL, FUCK"" Not tasty food, grocery shopping, not making love, but eat. kill. fuck. The essential three functions that all animals share in common. Get nutrients, kill to defend itself and provide food, fuck - reproduce. This is true all the way down to unicellular organisms.

We humans have a part of the brain that is very old. It is just about the oldest part of the brain. This part of the brain is called *the midbrain*. This part of the brain has been with us before we knew how to speak, before we knew how to use tools and build shelters. This is our where our animistic instincts are.

The point I'm trying to make is that addiction inserts itself into the survival hierarchy. In fact it is theorized that for some people, it is so deeply embedded in their hierarchy that they may die for their addiction.

Dr. Kevin T. McCauley describes addiction as a disease and provides compelling evidence that **addiction is a disease**. He says that if you presented an addict with a gun and the drug they are dependent on, and told they will be killed if they take the drug; the addict will refuse the drug. This is because for the majority of ""psychologically healthy"" people the drug is part of their *survival* hierarchy and reason goes that if taking the drug will kill them right then and there then it is ""only human"" to refuse the drug in order to live. The point is that this ""higher power"" thing that AA and NA are talking about is actually a very good way to treat addiction. Higher power can be your life, it can be your children, your family etc.. Dr. Kevin T. McCauley says that he had a patient who stopped drinking because her young son asked her to stop. She saw first hand the damage she was doing and decided that he was more important than the drug.

The reason I am saying all this is because I want you to be aware of the profound effect drug addiction has on peoples behavior. That person stealing for drug money isn't the same person they were before the drug. It is no excuse for stealing, you can't say oh I have a disease, its still a choice. However biologically, that person is only doing what their body is telling them is necessary to live. 

You can treat your addiction. You can get clean and it is easier than you think.

For anyone interested in learning more about the physiology of addiction or recovering from addiction, I strongly recommend you google or find on youtube; Dr. Kevin T. McCauley",1358568709.0

I'm pretty sure they're not collapsing, because when I remove the needle, blood is present-however, they refuse to register.

At that point I would use one regular dosage (lets say that is .05 grams of heroin or 1 roxi) and didn't use again until I started W/Ding again. Would this be an effective taper? ,"I've been using too much H lately, close to a gram a day of some really good stuff. I really need to cut back because I am going broke. Hell, I need to quit but that's the next step. 

I'm not ready to do this cold turkey because I can't take time off from my job.so I'm hoping to taper as much as I can before I either stop completely, bring down my tolerance enough to the point where my habit is affordable. 

So I usually sort of start to feeling withdrawals about 12 hours after I stop using. I'm wondering if this method would make my withdrawals in the end a little better. I would rather suffer a little bit for a longer period of time than I would suffer a lot for a few days if I were to quit cold turkey. Now I don't know if the science behind this idea is sound. The bigger your habit, the worse the withdrawals are if I understand this correctly, so the less you do each day the withdrawals wouldn't be bad as well? I would also be working on decreasing the dosage, so if w/d's are dependent on the ""acute"" (I can't think of a better term for non-longterm) factors, it would be addressed s well


The absolute worst part of withdrawals for me is the insomnia. If I could at least sleep it off, I would feel a little bit better but jesus christ, the restless leg syndrome, the hot cold flashes, and everything else while you're struggling to try and sleep is torture. I can handle it during the day for a couple of hours but when I wan to sleep I want to sleep!

here is what you need. cimetidine or generic tagamet. can be bought at any drugstore. white grapefruit juice, available at most grocery stores. loperimide, or generic immodium. walmart sells 2 bottles of 72 2mg pills for under 10 bucks. take 1000mg of cimetidine and drink 12 oz. of the juice. these 2 items inhibit cytochrome enzymes responsible for first pass metabolism of many drugs. taking these will allow more of the drug to be absorbed into your bloodstream, and at high enough doses lope WILL pass the blood brain barrier.
45 minutes or so after taking the cimetidine and juice, take anywhere from 35 to 70 of the 2mg lopes, depending on your tolerance. this absolutely will lessen your withdrawals if not relieve them entirely. lope seems to have a half-life similar to methadone, so a single dose will last 24 hrs. often it lasts me 48 before i feel like i need to dose again. you will get some wicked constipation, so definitely get yourself some laxative and use it as needed. on the plus side, you will save money on toilet paper.
this has absolutely worked for me and everyone else i know who has tried it. the lope will work unpotentiated for little jobs, but for a decent habit potentiating the lope is a must.

I ran out of oxy the other day, so I took a little bit of methadone to stay well. Only 5mg kept me pretty well, giving you a sense of how low my tolerance is.

Anyway about 6 hours later in the day I took the methadone I got some heroin. I've heard stories about this stuff being fire, but I assumed this was just Internet weenies who've never had good dope before.   

Anyway mistake #1 was trying to do it around my s/o (who doesn't know that I do any of this stuff).  I went to a bathroom and eyeballed out .05g and did that real quick.   That barely touched me -- felt good through dinner but wasn't completely out of it or even nodding.

We got back in from dinner about 2 hrs later.   I ran back and eyeballed out 2x the previous line, figuring that if .05g wasn't enough to make me nod .1g would probably put me in a really decent place.     .1g put me totally over the edge.  Was so pale and out of it my s/o made me goto the er.  I was sick as fuck all the next day for some reason.  Just rejoining the land of the living today.

Lessons out of all this (for me anyway):
*eyeballing small quantities of unknown strength is fucking stupid
*Apparantly Internet dope is pretty good (?)
* taking methadone + new dope I'm not familiar with = stupid
* in general I'm just stupid.

Sadly s/o knows about habit now, which will make things interesting.  I'm definitely still out of it.  I was asking s/o to go buy food from stores that don't exist in this town this morning for example.

","I used to be a travel agent, and everytime I faced clients who were users, I could always tell because their trips would cut short halfway and or they would get completly fucked up or arrested trying to score in another country. When I spoke to them about it, they always said "" we were absolutely sure we brought enough for the whole trip, but we ran out halfway through"", or ""three days in"". 

I had one specific couple that at least once a year would book a seven day or 14 day vacation, use everything they had in the first 3 or 4 days, have to rebook their flights home, and by the time they hit the home airport, they were so dope sick, they had to have people meet them at the airport with a fix. Of course this never worked our with the timing they wanted & they always had problems trying not to puke going through customs or whatever . Sometimes they would try and score wherever they were , which always ended with them being ripped off, and usually ended with them being assaulted as well. The woman was horribly unpleasant when she was dope sick .

I particularly used to sell a lot of cruises, and used to constantly have to tell people "" if you smoke pot in Jamaica, **dont** try and bring it back on the ship , you're going to find the police there searching everybody, and your going to end up in a Jamaican jail unti, someone comes up with enough money to get you out"".  The dealers sell you a bag, give the high sign to the police, who get you on your eay back in, and will give the remainder of the drugs back to the dealer in exchange for burning you.

And it didn't matter, some idiots would always try and do it and get arrested . I would tell people if for some reason you have illegal drugs with you on the ship, throw it overboard before you hit the port where you get off in Miami or wherever , because the cruisline usually has to give them a few cabins to search before they clear the ship, and if they think you're possessing , they'll give them your cabin. 

Now that it's post 911, and the TSA is putting their hands up people's asses, I pretty much have to have my doctor write a notarized letter so when I go through security with the pills in my carry on, and I get pulled aside, I have the documentation to prove they are required meds. I once had TSA try and tell me it was dangerous material, and I had to check it , which I refused to do, and had to get a supervisor, who actually called the fucking FBI before I was allowed to board with it, which means I always go to the airport 6 hours before my flight . 


What I have had luck with though is going to pharmacies on islands in the Caribbean like Cozumel Mexico and scoring Soma, Xanax, tramadol, some decent pain killers, valium. Recently ships have started to look at the pill bottles you bring back with you from islands, but there are ways to get around that.

Now I've had my times with our DOC and for the most part I've had it under 
control, (I understand I am addicted, and sought out help) within the past few 
months. How have I done this you ask? Simple suboxone. But this isn't a story 
of kicking this is a story of some pretty damn good luck! Unfortunately I have 
not been able to afford my sub script for the past week, and with bupe/nox 
rapidly leaving my system during days 6-7 without anything I was feeling terrible, 
absolutely like shit. I couldn't sleep at all last night knowing that Tuesday I would
be getting paid. So Tuesday morning finally comes after hours in limbo rolling 
around sweating. I get ready as best my sorry ass could, feeling like Bernie, from
the classic Weekend At Bernie's. I come to the decide to treat myself to a high
before I go back on my sub regiment (of course!). I call my dude and everything
is a go, I could not get to the nearest ATM quick enough. Palms sweating, body 
shaking, relief just around the corner in my mind I swipe my card and rapidly hit 
the withdrawal key (yes I see the irony in that button as well) instead of cash the 
dreaded insufficient funds pop up. ""No!"" I think to myself,""this can NOT be happening!""
I am completely defeated, deflated, crushed, ruined, fucked. Damn MLK day pushed 
my direct deposit back a day. I spent the next couple of hours cursing myself in bed. 
Oh and one thing I forget to tell you good people is that I had traffic court at 4 pm, 
just another horrible event to add to the day's list.

Now with our hero in this story, better yet known as myself, thinking and accepting 
the day as a full bust I get ready for court. I notice that I am missing a paper that I
needed for the courts. So I search my car where I thought I put it. Now this is where 
my day turns around. In the pouch behind my driver seat I pull out a piece of paper 
thinking it's that paid ticket I needed. It wasn't bropiates, it most def wasn't. It turns 
out I had stashed a pay check behind there from August (I was working 3 jobs at the time).
This paycheck is for an actually good amount of money to. Instantly I am so happy,
""Victory is in the air!"" I scream as I head to the bank to cash it. Once cashed I head to my 
dude and I tell him I would like 15 bags of the finest ECP, which I usually get for $100. He 
says he's busy (oh no!) but sends one of his little runners to meet me. The process takes 
about 15 minutes to meet with the runner. I hand him the money as he throws the goods 
in my car and takes off. For some reason I feel something was off, and it was. Once I stopped
to inspect the product I see the runner actually gave me 25 bags! 10 freaking bags over! I'm 
not one to try and get over on my connect for a few bags so I gave him a call (I didn't even 
have the runner's number) and tell him that he had given me extra, his response, ""Don't worry 
dude keep it, my mistake."" Words couldn't describe how happy I was, and to top it off this shit 
is fire! I did 2 bags and it floored me, which hasn't happened in years.  So looks like I have a day
or two of nods ahead of me before I go back to my regiment, happy days my friends happy days
indeed! Oh and court got dismissed so it turned into a great day all in all. Thanks for listening bros
I know it was a little on the long side but I tend to get long winded when I am fucked up. So here's 
my first post into our small but awesome community. Happy nods to all!

In which so we have to go to a chemist to be ""dosed under supervision each day.""

Now i'm on 8mg, and its my second day on treatment it is working well at holding me. But however as my scheming mind is scheming. I'm interested in peoples experience with using on top of suboxone, as obviously I can't go on a break as they make sure it goes under your tounge and mostly dissolves before you can leave the pharmacy.  So I'm wondering if people have had success with breaking through the bupe. 

Also, I was thinking I could prehaps have some small bit of pink gum on my finger when I put the suboxone film under my tounge, quickly swallow OT (rendering it almost useless.) while putting the little bit of pink gum there (already chewed and gooey.) because they will allow you to go once its mostly dissolved and make it seem as though that as what has happened when in reality I swallowed it. Do that for 2 days.. Dose early morning then shoot some dope around 3:00pm leaving 32 hours since last dose of bupe. Giving me a night of being high. Then dosing 6:00pm the next day to avoid p/w...

Seems like extreme lengths but I would still love to use once in a while, and if I didn't already mention, skipping doses is not acceptable possibley once every few months, otherwise risking getting kicked from the program.

all I've heard is how snorting is wasting and IVing is 10 times better.

I've been snorting for about 10 months.

so the first time I hit the shot it was some very weak crappy dope.  probably the worst I've ever had.  but the shot i Just did 10 minutes ago is some good shit, not the best I ever had but above average dope for sure.

now I have to admit the shots were small.  not even a point.  but the thing is I put the same amount of H in the spoon as I would on an average to slightly below average size line that I would normally do.

and just....no rush whatsoever.  all I keep hearing about is the rush.  I'm definitely high and feeling good right now but this shot is on top of 4 lines that I've done since about 7:30.  the lines and shot probably equal about .2 or a little over .2.

I definitely didn't miss either, there's no lump or anything at the injection site.  it doesn't hurt or anything.  I nailed the shot.

I am feeling pretty high I guess.  I can't stop rubbing my face.  I may still be coming up.  ya I feel like I did another .2.  I'm high for sureeee.  but where was the rush?

I've been IVing heroin since August. It hasn't been a daily thing for me, but lately (last two weeks or so) it has been. I have been having my boyfriend administer all my shots, but last week I tried to hit myself for the first time and did so successfully. 

Basically I'm a pretty big wuss when it comes to hitting myself, so I won't do it unless I'm absolutely sure I can do it right. I was having some trouble getting my shots yesterday, so I went ahead and had my boyfriend do them. 

The first shot he did registered well, and then when he started to push it, it burned pretty badly. I had him check it, and it was still in, so he slowed his push and kept injecting me. When I looked down, it had a small bubble next to the injection site. This happened two other times yesterday when he did my shots, so today I decided to do mine myself. 

I found a spot on my thigh that was close to the surface so I could see it and get it, and it went in first try, and registered first try as well. I started to push the shot (VERY little of it!) and it happened again...burning like no other. I removed it to see another little bubble! I found another safe spot, registered, and pushed (also VERY little!!!) and once again, fucking terrible burning and a bubble. 

My boyfriend went ahead and found me another spot, and this time he was able to get it without any pain or bubbles. My friend says that the veins where the shots burned look like they're blown (kind of bluish and bruised), but I don't know why so many veins in such a short period would blow, especially since I was being no more rough with them than usual. Why would this happen multiple times in a row?

UPDATE: It turns out the only problem I was having was being severely dehydrated. Stay hydrated, folks, because if you get too dehydrated, your veins can blow out on you and you can bruise pretty severely. Veins are no longer blowing out, and my bruises are clearing up.",1358909119.0

Now would it be the same for the effects of diphenhydramine (benedryl) because it makes you nod? I also heard that benedryl helps to break the opiates down better when they are metabolizing.

I hear the song, Semi-charmed Kind of Life, by 3EB. It was playing through pandora on my phone. The lyrics, ""I want something else"" kept repeating, and it triggered something in my brain.

But a few nights ago, some friends came by to play music, and one of them had some suboxone. I am not opiate dependent, and I've only done opiates a handful of times, all at least 2 years or so in the past. I took roughly 1.5 mg of suboxone, a 1mg benzo, and drank a lot of whiskey and vodka all night. The last thing I remember is sitting at the drums.

My next memory is waking up at 6 in the morning, and seeing my girlfriend looking worried, asking me if I remembered anything about the bathroom. ""The bathroom?"" I said.
Oh boy...

So apparently, after my friends left, and she noticed I had been gone for at least an hour, she set out to find me. The light was on in the bathroom, the door was locked, and she could see me on the floor when she looked under the door. She had to pick the lock and drag me out. According to her retelling, I wasn't breathing, and so she had to shake and slap me until I came to, and when I did, the whites of my eyes were solid red, and my pupils were ""nonexistent. The size of poppy seeds."" She walked me all the way back to the room where I passed out again, and continued to wake me up every hour or so.

So that was that night. The next day, I felt sick. Like drinking and smoking and feeling the spins. For the better part of the day, I couldn't eat, could barely muster the energy to move, and everything I did made me feel like puking. I'd light a cigarette, and after two drags have to put it out because it made me so nauseous. Oddly though, I felt very peaceful. Very blank. Even though physically I was miserable, I felt this overwhelming love and maternal warmth from her for taking care of me. My brain was very...airy. I couldn't really focus on more than one simple idea at a time, and I spent most of the day sleeping.

But that night....oh man....the nightmares. Drifting off to sleep and demonic utterances sputtering out of my mouth. Not sure the sounds and voices I was hearing were in my head or in the room. Reality felt like a dream, and the dream felt like reality. I kept feeling like clutter was all around me, uncomfortably close to me. I had disturbing nightmares about sinister machines burning me, clutter everywhere, headless bodies next to my bed, and sliding up the wall and across the ceiling and screaming out things like ""I CAN TALK TO THE SKY!"" to try and call the bluff of my dream terrifying me.

The next day, the feelings were diminished, I could eat, walk around, but I still felt utterly sapped, and lied in bed sleeping on and off until sunset. Still felt a little nauseous, didn't have energy to do much, still had this smoldering dread somewhere in me. That night, which was last night, the nightmares were a little more whimsical. But I still felt the terror as I tried to fall asleep, and it took me a long time to drift off. This morning, I awoke feeling a general sense of frustration and discomfort. My body still aches a little, and I feel sapped of pleasure. But I can feel the happiness returning.

So there is my account of how it felt. I only went into such detail so that I could illustrate the experience as clear as possible. Because my question is this- how similar is my experience to an opiate withdrawal? I'm very tuned to the balance of horrors and pleasures that my usual vices offer, but never has my psyche been so thrown off kilter by an unfamiliar breed. And I wonder how much of that is chemical, and how much is the workings of my own brain. My girlfriend had the suboxone and the benzos, minus the alcohol, but her fateful evening consisted of puking all night and watching over me. The next day, her ""hangover"" was much milder than mine, and it was gone by the following day. However, she has a history in the distant past of both benzo and opiate abuse, and so I wonder, if at least for the suboxone, if she didn't have something of a tolerance for it.

I'm sorry to write this essay here, it was just a very specific case (opiate-intolerant suboxone first timer mixed with benzos and alcohol), and I scoured the internet but found nothing. I doubt that what I experienced was like a full-on opiate withdrawal, but I do suspect that it was a shred of what it was like. I'm just hoping any of you here could shed some light.

Thank you.",1358872934.0

Afterwords, and right now I guess too, I have this feeling, it's so hard to describe. It's like 50% of the  *best* rush of heroin, but it's constant.  It stays here for about 1.5 hours, and it's absolutely wonderful. Not to mention that the actual rush is **multiple** times better than the heroin rush.

About 7 months into our relationship thing got weird... He became distant,  my gut was telling me something was up. fast forward to 3 months later One day i caught him using in my bathroom found the needle and spoon.  I just broke down, i didn't want to believe what i found was real. He just kept repeating how sorry he was over and over.... He told me he wanted help. We made in a doctors aptt for the next day to get him on Subs. (To be clear, this was HIS choice) That night was the longest night of my life... i asked him just to please be honest and he handed over the rest of the H, needle and spoon. Before bed he asked if he could use the last of it, so that's what he did. Now I know what to look for i know the difference from when he is using and when  he is sober. He has been ""Clean"" now for 1 year. He still takes 2mgs of sub a day.. he is working on cutting down. Has a full time job. He knows i love and support him,  But as a non user ill never quit understand his relationship he had with his drugs and that's okay i don't try to. But its scary to try and move forward in a relationship when i KNOW there is always a chance he could relapse... It scares the shit out of me to be honest.

Here are some of mine. Nothing special or anything that hasn't been done millions of times before:

- I hack a lot. If you don't know, it's where you drive around and look for people flagging for rides. Kind of like a cheap taxi service. Around here in Baltimore City, this is one of the easiest ways to make money. You just have to know where to go to pick up your hacks.
- I don't boost myself but I have a few friends who do. I'll pick them up sometimes and take them boosting then take them to sell their shit and cop. I have one friend who is insanely good at boosting and he's usually my go-to guy in the mornings if I'm sick and broke.
- I sometimes go scrapping. A normal sized air conditioner can be broken down and scrapped for $25 - $30. You just have to know what you're doing when you're breaking stuff down. If I'm desperate, there are tons of business parks where I live where I can go dumpster diving and find tons of scrap.
- I cop for people. I have tons of good connects and a lot of friends that don't or would rather have someone else take the risk when copping. Everyone I know knows I play fair so they look out for me, I look out for them.
- Sometimes I'll park my car near a gas pump and give people a story about running out of gas and realizing that I left my wallet at home. I'll tell them I'm trying to scrape together enough just to make it back home. I dress nice for this and I'm good with talking to people. Sometimes I can make $20 in just a few minutes doing this. I've had people just hand me $20 before. Sometimes people will just pay for the gas at the cashier but hey, free gas :) Sometimes I'll make a couple hundred dollars in a day, but sometimes it seems like NOBODY is trying to kick anything out.

Anyways, like I said, nothing special. I don't rob or steal, mostly because I just don't have the heart for it. I depend on my car a lot. Whenever I have car issues and I'm desperate, I'll just flat out pan handle. ""Hey man, I'm trying to make some bus fare, can you help me out a bit?"".

Do you find on methadone you are ""holding out"" more each day before you dose, then you would on suboxone.

The wife flipped out on me tonight saying they were leaving her sisters party to help me out and I never share or give them anything and they do all the work and take the risk and I should at least throw them 10$ here and there. 

I think this is absurd. Firstly, you're dealing. You're making that choice. Secondly, I KNOW you're making shit off me. I drive often and pay for the gas and always Make offers for food or a drink or whatever. The reason she is mad is she's leaving her sisters party for me. I said ""I just made 100$ tonight and wanna blow some money!""  She thought I wanted to spend 100 on them so she left thinking she was going to make a ton. When I told them I only needed. 50 she flipped saying ""I thought you had 100$ and you said this and you never share wtf blah blah"" I calmly explained that HAVING 100$ doesn't mean I want to SPEND 100.

Often, if I do it on a completely empty stomach (including empty of water, barring maybe a banana or something), this helps; if there's anything in my stomach, though it usually makes it worse.

Edit: So, I've figured what I have to do is just do it on an empty stomach.  Using potentiators also helps to reduce the volume of fluid I need to drink.  I've found diluting doesn't help, but adding a crap ton of lemon juice to cut the taste does help.  Also, I've found that waiting at least an hour or two after ingesting to eat anything else is conducive to not throwing up later in the nod.

","So basically the past four or so days have been total shit. Tuesday-Thursday me and the ex have been arguing like crazy about where we stand and whether we should just stop talking or not. Friday I tried to have a “serious talk” with him about where we stand and it blew up. I got so upset and basically cried all night. Saturday morning I had to go to a court ordered class from a DUI I got over the summer. The “class” consisted of everyone sitting in a circle and talking about why we were there and our drug/alcohol problems. Pretty much everyone in the class was there for alcohol or weed. Although I felt like the odd ball out with my DOC I tried to take the whole thing seriously because I thought it would be good for me since I really have no one else to talk to. Turns out that was a bad idea because at one point in the middle of me talking I must have triggered something and completely burst into tears. I couldn’t speak anymore so I just ran out the room into the bathroom; I was too embarrassed to go back but had no choice because I had left my purse there. Needless to say I did not share anymore for the remainder of the class. After the class I went to work. I had several girls tell me that another co-worker was being promoted to a manager, which they’ve been telling me they were going to do that to me like forever ago. I was so enraged and hurt that once again I burst out into tears and was a raging bitch to all my coworkers. Eventually I knocked on my manager’s door and told him off about the issue while still crying. He claimed it was a big misunderstanding, but only time will tell. Once again I felt really embarrassed. Today I texted my ex to see what was up and he basically told me he is still mad because the whole talk i had with him was very irritating and unnecessary. YET AGAIN there I was crying at work. I was supposed to get pills from this girl after I got off work because my normal dealer hasn’t been texting me back all weekend. Lo and behold a huge snow storm just arises out of nowhere a few hours before I get off work. I did not get the pills. I texted my dealer again when I get home and was basically like “what the fuck.” Apparently he hasn’t been getting back to me because he thinks I have “changed” ever since I have started talking to my ex again and blah blah blah. The only reason his two cents even matter is because we are also semi-friends. And to top it all off he basically implied that he no longer cares to talk to me because he now thinks it’s a “waste of time” which basically means he will probably not sell to me anymore.

The problem is that I have Panic Disorder so I spend half the ride convincing myself that I didn't take too much even though I've taken that exact dose before. 


I don't take them with benzos or anything, just the opiates.


**My Question**: Is there a way to calculate that enough time has passed to say with certainty that X amount of opiates has reached it's half-life and that it's all smooth sailing from here on out? Or is that just an idiotic thing to say.

I have a concern regarding these wonderful little bundles of joy. I've been a daily user for going on about three years now, and only recently have I felt like they have lost their euphoric essence.

I've maintained a habit of no more than 60mg of Hydrocodone for around the first 2.5 years of my addiction, which I kept limited to nighttime after uni/work. Well, 60mg wasn't cutting it anymore, so I decided to up the dosage yet again.

I understand tolerance, but ever since that euphoria that the Hydrocodone would bring on had vanished, I have not been able to regain that feeling. At this point in time I have taken upwards of 300mg of Hydrocodone, 140mg of Roxi, 50mg of Dilaudid (intranasally,) and even up to 60mg of Methadone.

It seems the more I take, the more sedated I feel, but there is never any euphoria/rush anymore. I have not tried heroin (impossible to find here,) nor have I ever injected anything. I had even picked up some coke, which brought no euphoria (might have been bad coke, was my first/only time, and I live in the middle of nowhere.)

I'm assuming some of you out there understand this exact situation, so I am asking you, is there anything I can do to bring that back? Will injecting be the only course I can take to feel good again?

Opiates were the only thing that would bring a little bit of joy into, what I consider, my completely miserable existence, and now even that's gone. I understand that they are only a band-aid toward a bigger wound, but they've been the only thing I've found to help, and believe me, I've tried a lot of other routes. When I had that euphoria to look forward to at the end of the day, it made me motivated to get shit done during the day. Now, since it has disappeared, I have fallen off the wagon, and into the pit of misery I was in before opiates first entered my life.

I've tried Googling this question and digging through the archives, and I've found all sorts of results. So, I'll split this up into two questions:

a) How strong was the *best* #4 you've ever tried in comparison to oxy?

b) Assuming the seller prices his stuff in line with the market (I'm in the USA), how strong would you guess this stuff is in comparison to oxy?",1359484797.0

Okay, maybe that was harsh, so let me rephrase... What is it with your friends in recovery, with their caring and shit? With their sideways glances, the deep looks into your eyes to see how pinned they are today, the glaces at the tops of hands, insides of elbows, and their silent judgement. I'm happy you're clean, but I've seen you spill your shot and try drawing out of my dirty carpet, so stop looking at me like that.

But still, friends are friends, and even with my atrophied sense of morality, that demands some degree of allegiance. So when they call, begging, cajoling, demanding I go to the bar, what am I to say? No? Well... Yeah, actually. At least until one of them offers to pick up my tab.

So that was how I found myself out on Thursday night, college night, closer to a decade after my graduation than not, sipping shitty beer in a shitty bar, listlessly hitting on freshmen with fake IDs made by the same guy I buy my coke from. Jesus, I don't even drink anymore. I don't even *fuck* anymore, I'm so limp-dicked from shooting up almost anything that promises to make me feel half human again. But still, I'm here, pretending to enjoy hearing the lies about my friends' desk jobs, clean-time, and - really, you boring motherfuckers - new power tools.

At least they aren't staging an intervention, right? No one would do that in a bar. That's what I told myself when I went to the bathroom to shoot the Opana I had stored in my shoe.

When I get back there's another round, so that's okay. Shots. Neat. Maybe I'll get drunk and actually have fun. Let the chubby redhead take me back to her dorm if I can convince her I'm really a grad student at her school. 

Whatever. 

Drink.

When my glass hits the table, I can feel their eyes on me. Expectant... ""Well, what?"" I ask. ""Do your shots."" (That's the junkie talk slipping out, ""do,"" not ""take."" I've been in too long.)

""Brother... We need to talk. You need to get off the dope,"" one says. He actually calls me brother. The sanctimonious fuck.

""Don't say anything. We did this because we love you. We dosed that shot with two sub strips.""

The room goes cold. Time slows. I can't feel the sick coming, not yet, but I know it will. I flash to every time I'm kicked, every sick junkie I've ever seen. The movies Trainspotting and Requiem. My stomach knots, and in the time I open my mouth to ask him if he's serious, my body tells me he is.

I sit in silence. I let them watch me. Their eyes are full of concern. Compassion. Two have been where I was going. One had a lover die from too much Xanax and Oxy. Part of me wants to not hate them. I wish I was clean, so I could laugh at their shitty jokes and enjoy this shitty bar.

But most of me feels the sick that is starting to march on the Paris of my high like a million rabid Nazis. The part of me that sat through grad school and a thousand hours getting certified to treat fuck-ups like me says this isn't how you stage an intervention. The biggest part of me, the part I hate, the part I love, the part that I identify as *ME,* the junkie...

He says quietly, ""Take me home now, or I swear I'll kill one of you before the other two can stop me.""

""We have Clonidine, K-Pins, and Xanax at home. Scotch too. Precipitated withdrawal is bad, but you're gonna wind up dead one day... Come with us and kick. Please...""

I say nothing. I can taste bile in my throat. Vomit from the sick or from anger, I don't know. Same with the shaking I can feel in my hands. But my gaze is level. Even. My eyes don't blink. Maybe they can see them dilate from pin-points as the adrenaline is hitting my system, or maybe they know they've fucked up. Two of these guys I've fought with before, for fun. Fraternity Fight Nights, a way of releasing tension. Another saw me throw another man off a two-story balcony after he hit my once-upon-a-time, one that got-away, girlfriend.

I don't break my gaze as I pick up an empty beer bottle and walk it across my fingers. Even with the shakes, I'm better with my hands than a magician. Shooting up in winter-cold Chicago alleys will leave you with some non-drug related skills. They watch as it goes from the drinking a beer-with-buddies to the someone-is-about-to-pick-glass-out-of-a-serious-wound-hand-grip.

I can see their thoughts. Would he do it? To one of us? Oh god, to *me?* I'm wondering the same thing... The same thing, plus calculating the time back to my house, the time to prep a shot, the strength to get through 16 mg - *Jesus-fucking-Christ that's a lot of sub* - the way my friend's blood would look on my hands, these hands, these hands that I swore would never commit violence again, these hands that have seen blood before, these hands that used to hold two beautiful women that I both lost to this habit, these hands that once wrote beautiful poetry, music, made art, and love, and beauty...

""I'll take you home... I... I'm sorry.""

Still, the whole time home I'm wondering if they weren't right, even if their methods were wrong. But the biggest part of me is wondering if I could feel well off enough morphine.

The answer is yes, I can.

Throw in your tips on keeping things moving. 

You should always keep a good bowel regime. Having to have an operation to remove impacted feces is not nice and I have seen a large number of them go wrong, some so bad that people have to shit into a colostomy bag the rest of their days. Not fun or sexy. 

You should eat a high fibre diet to keep things in good shape and texture, roughage cleans out all the corners of your bowel and helps towards preventing diverticulitis and other long, fancy word diseases later in life. Because opiates slow peristalsis down in the gut some users take medications that increase peristalsis (anti-emetics such as metachlopromide increase motility) again but these are generally not strong enough to override the opiate receptors in your bowel. 

It's good practice to take a couple of stool softeners each morning. Coloxyl and senna are great for this. They don't incite violent riots in your gut, but they keep things soft and calm whilst they make their way to the back gate. 

Another option is to allow yourself to go into a mild withdrawal every couple of days. Once your belly starts churning its not long before you'll be pooping up a storm. Once the first or second bout of diarrhea is over (you'll know if you are still full or not) you can go back to getting high. It's not great doing this option because tummy cramps are uncomfortable and your ass feels like its being fucked with a red hot poker, but this is generally how we deal with it in our house. 

Wait until you are in mild wd's and crap, lay on your left side(thats the way your sigmoid colon bends so it'll be easier to keep the solution in your bum) then plug your drug. You'll appreciate the high a hell of a lot more, not only because you're wding, but because your asshole is on fire and needs pain relief. 

Farts are telegrams from Mr Poo saying that he'll be here shortly, but in wd's he doesn't always call first so don't trust that he won't turn up unannounced. 

I should add here that I've never used opiates any other way than IV so i cant speak for the effects of plugging, but as a nurse I've shoved a gazillion things up patients asses ranging from cameras to drugs to rubber tubes and everything in between. ",1359614017.0

Get dropped off near my house. On my way in the door, one of my other guys pulls up and flags me to his car. Asks me why I haven't been calling him.

I've always been totally cool with throwing him a bag or two whenever I pick up, and paying for all the gas involved because after all I don't currently have any decent connects and he can get some real fire. Seriously, sometimes half of what I'd be spending was for him, but he doesn't do too well financially, and I love the guy so I just look the other way on that stuff. He recently asked me if I could get blues, because he knew someone who was looking for them. I do have a connect for those, and I let slip how much money I could get them for some time ago.

Basically I was gonna charge him for 8, and keep 1 for myself, because now I get to be the middleman and I should be able to reap the benefits of this, right? So anyway he sends me a text about how he ""thought I was legit"" and was generally just pissed off asking how ""he was gonna make any money off this"". So I straight up told him ""You don't"" because this time I'm the one getting the stuff. In all honesty, I probably would have just said fuck it and let him have the 8 at cost, but I couldn't believe how pissed he was getting at me for doing the same thing he's always done to me. He basically told me to fuck off and not be ""pissed because I'm not getting a free perk 30"". 

So at this point I feel like I'm just rambling on, but am I in the wrong here somehow? It seems to me that he's just crying because he can't get what he wants, but honestly, I'm not the social type and have a hard time reading people.

tl;dr: Family who was used to being a middleman and charging for me got pissy when I wanted to do the same for him.

They each have their own unique product and maybe they are keeping it that way for business. 

Do the processes for making powder and tar involve the same precursors and stuff? Are they doing the same basic process but leaving out some final steps or what?

(Does anyone else?) I'll get the ball rolling...,"Although there are probably tons of these that apply to all of us that are commonly known (like does anyone else get itchy, etc), how about some that are lesser known or maybe just end up being only yourself that gets it? Chime in if something applies to you and try and leave another one for others to respond to! Who knows, someone might even have a problem they don't know about. That's not really my intention though, I'm just trying to open up fun and/or interesting discussion. 


I'll start: After a late night binge, DAE wake up the next morning with almost like a hangover type headache and dark colored urine? Almost like your kidney's were battling for your life while you were passed out? 

Also, DAE have drooling problems when they nod? It's starting to happen when I'm not even that out of it and it's kind of gross. 

Finally, for those of you with regular hook ups, DAE kind of like it when they have to wait awhile to get hooked up and get to the point where you're almost sick, just so you can feel the relief + the high? This is a little hard to explain and might sound stupid to people who don't have a consistent hook up, but I'm talking about a situation where you KNOW almost for a certainty you'll be getting it (so it's not a matter of worrying), and you've been high for like 4 months without even touching dope sickness, and it just works out where you start to get a little sick before you can get it, that you've almost forgotten the relief that comes from getting well and not just getting high? I personally don't have the self control to do it to myself, do others out there wait until they're at that point on purpose? Or like have something on hand and not touch it until they are at that point? (not talking with subs either, we've all put off taking our subs in hopes of a better high)

Ok that's enough for now, I'm sure other people will come up with more interesting things. ",1359873255.0

I originally bought 4 and had already done 2 of them, which is how I knew these were special. The other dope I have is pretty good too, but it takes me 4 bags to nod-I was higher off 2 bags of this then I would be off 6 bags of my other dope.

Anyway, I was so excited to do it last night, and maybe a little impatient.
On one of my first pokes, I had one of those instances where I ALMOST hit but it just wasn't quite in, so the syringe filled up with blood but I still wasn't registering. (GOD I HATE THAT.) So, now it's hard to see if I'm registering, since the solution in the rig is already cloudy with blood. I tied off REALLY tight and saw a pretty prominent vein that I never really noticed before-it was on my right hand, right above the wrist, and located straight down from the area between the knuckles on my index and middle fingers.

I THOUGHT I saw blood go back into the syringe, and the injection itself wasn't painful, but right at the end of the injection I noticed the tell-tale bubble of a missed shot. Now, this dope is SO powerful that I still nodded the fuck out. It was a bit sore last night, so I got a heating pad, and I alternated between heating it and massaging it. There was a bit of a bump there last night, and some allergic reaction hive type thingies.

I miss shots once in a while, this is not the first time, and it's often painful for a couple of hours.  The reason I'm concerned this time is because it's been 8 hours, and I am still sore as FUCK.  I can barely move my wrist up and down, and typing hurs. But there is ZERO evidence of any mishaps in terms of lumps, bumps or bruises.
How concerned should I be? I'm thinking I can wait this out for a while, and if it gets worse or stays this bad for a week, go see a doc.  I'd be a lot more concerned if there was an angry, swollen bump or something.

Am I on the right track? Do I need to be more concerned? Less concerned?  Thanks.",1359834852.0

$1,000 put away at her grandparents for in case of emergency fund.
$1,000 on our son, new clothes, toys, his birthday this month.
$2,000 to catching up on bills and getting a few used pieces of furniture for the house, groceries, and a few things like a blu-ray player and whatnot.
$1,000 to paying bills off in advance.
$1,000 to whatever my fiancé wants to do with.
$1,000 to whatever I want to do with, which I'll probably spend on a decent used car.
$1,000 towards a used car. With the other 1k I have I should be able to get something decent, nothing fancy.
And last but not least, $1,000 on fucking opiates! We're gonna get a bunch of different shit off SR, and gonna grab like 3 grams off my d-boy.

We went to this seedy ass strip club in Bridgeport. I thought it would be weird and depressing.. We got there and we immediately blew through the singles my buddy spotted me, and had a couple beers on him, (he's a great guy and we always help each other out in the name of fun if one of us doesn't have much cash.) After we blew through our little pile of ones, we retired back toward the bar to drink a couple beers and enjoy the view of all the hot Latino women. Then, out of nowhere, a real cool black dude came up and introduced himself. He asked us why we stopped giving the dancers singles that were pretty much staying right in front of us and giving us a great show. He then proceeded to hand us each a fresh 20 dollar bill for our own personal lap dances and about ten singles.. I couldn't believe it! He explained that ""it's all about having fun, and he wants us to have a blast!"" So that was one of the coolest strip club experiences I ever had, (only the second time I have ever been..) So we headed home late in the night and crashed. Then the next morning my buddy who I was riding back North with, (he lives in the same city up North as me,) picked me up and as I promised I would, I brought him to meet one of my connects down in BPT.. I called my awesome connect that I haven't seen in over a year (my buddy hooked me up with his new number as I hooked him up with most of my connects before I moved North.) I called him and explained I only had 140; (he does real nice stamped/taped bundles from Harlem for like a hundo, (cheaper if you get multiple) and that I wanted to meet him on my way back North.. He met us in an extremely timely fashion and handed me 2 and a half buns explaining that I should call him and not the other members from his squad I usually meet when I'm down there, saying that he appreciated me hooking him up with a few of my friends before I moved up North that bring him A LOT of business!! I was so pumped! I had no money, but because of the kindness of strangers and old friends, had one of the best weekends of my life!!! Hope you guys had good weekends as well! Cheers!

**TL:DR - My old connect hooked me up with a shit ton of free bags (pretty much a whole bun) when my buddy was only buying about a bun and a half, and had one of the sickest strip club experiences so far in my life!!!

My knee was also the size of a softball. I iced the FUCK out of it all morning, then went to my GP to get a script for vicoprofen-I rarely ask, so he never asks and just fills it. Besides, I have dislocated my left knee 3 times (1x full dislocation, where it was wrapped around knee for 2 hours) and my right knee 12 times (2x full dislocation)

As luck would have it, he is out of the office until next week, and my Dr's office has a policy that no scripts can be written without the doc present.
It was 4 when I went over there (walk in clinic)
So, I went home and iced it some more.  Figured I would go to the walk in across town.  I woke up this morning, still hobbling, and hopped in the shower.  I looked down, and low and behold, the swelling is gone!

I so have a note from my GP saying that he has prescribed me narcotics nultiple times for knee issues in the past.  Will that be enough?  Is there anything I can say/do to convince this doc that I'm not just nilking it?
I usually get to the doc within 6 hours of the tweak, so I don't even have to say anything-it's quite obvious my knee is fucked.

I am having a histamine reaction (I think) to an oxy injection. What do I do? Am I in any danger?,"About an hour and a half ago I mainlined for the first time in 7 years. I've been using opiates since then (swallowing and snorting) but have not had access to needles and have been disinterested because I don't want to get myself in deeper with using the needle.

I am a frequent visitor to this subreddit but created this throwaway because I am so fucking embarrased by my mistake and I'm really worried and don't know what to do: I really need my bropiate's help here.

I injected 20mg Oxycodone HCl (Qualitest brand) in the form of four 5mg instant release tablets. I am prescribed these by my doctor and am normally just fine swallowing them. However I've been missing the rush so I purchaced two needles and took a shot tonight.

**Here's a picture of the exact pills**: http://i.imgur.com/sjT0IV2.jpg

Here's the scoop though: I snort them sometimes and when I do, I get a very odd, intense itching in the back of my throat, in my mouth and in my nose. This isn't like *regular* itching that comes after snorting, this is a lot worse. Also my airway closes up for a bit and I sneeze to high heaven (usually when snorting I don't).

Anyway I thought that reaction just had to do with my nasal passages for some reason. I was WRONG.

Almost immediately after I injected, my palms became really itchy, and then my airways started closing up like they do when I snort them, only *much worse*. I instantly figured out that I was having a histamine reaction to some inactive ingredient or binder. I do have a little histamine intolerance (wine-headaches, etc). Since I knew that this is a temporary reaction, I didn't freak out and call 911, but it was a lot worse and lasted a lot longer. Luckily I have an asthma inhaler so I just sat on the toilet for a while taking deep, long breaths and using my inhaler.

Then I started noticing where I injected swelling up like crazy. Before I registered, I tried a few different spots on my left forearm. My first attempt I got blood and injected very slowly and noticing it was getting popped under my skin, so I exited that area. Soon after I found my old vein on my hand that used to always work and lo-and-behold, it worked again! I got a fabulous vein and slowly injected, occasionally pulling back to make sure I was still in the vein. I had gotten 100% of the shot in.

Anyway, both my first, failed attempt and my successful (no bumps!) injection sites started swelling like crazy. There is no pain, just a lot of swelling.

About twenty minutes after the shot, my breathing returned to normal and I took a benadryl for the swelling.

Fast forward to now, an hour and a half later, and the swelling in my hand and in my arm where I had failed... it keeps getting bigger. It feels firm and there's no pain except for a little bit if I press hard on it. I haven't put ice on it yet but I am as soon as I press the 'submit' button, and am going to take another benadryl. I feel 100% fine, I'm not even drowsy from the shot.

Please tell me: am I in ANY DANGER? I filtered out the shot extremely well and there were no particulates in the mixture. I didn't cook it, I read you weren't supposed to. I also read the injection harm reduction guide pdf in the side-bar *before* I took the shot. Am I going to get a clot of some kind? Do I need to go the emergency room even though I feel fine, and there is no pain or even itching where it's swollen? I really want to avoid that if at all possible.

I am however, pretty worried about the possibilities. Let's just say that FUCK THIS, I am never mainlining again. It's just too fucking risky, even if you're 100% sterile with 100% clean dope or whatever, there are still a million things that can go wrong. I don't need this.

PLEASE respond with any information you can, or whether this has happened to you and what you did about it... even just links to information. Thanks guys.

**TL;DR**: Injected four 5mg oxycodone hcl ir tabs and am having a histamine reaction, also wondering if there's anything else going on I should know about and what I should do about all this. NEVER AGAIN!

I've made good PST with seeds from this same distributor before (p. somnif, unwashed, potent) using water, and extracting the desired alkaloids into grain alcohol sounds much more efficient and practical. From there I'd evaporate it into a smokable or edible solid, and maybe concentrate some into laudanum or a tincture. 


Those other drug sites are full of contradictions and BS science, so I'm coming to you guys for grown-up advice. Here's what I need to know:

- The ideal proof of the solvent. Is higher simply better?

- The best ratio of seed weight (or volume) to alcohol volume.

- How long the mixture should be left to extract and how frequently I need to shake or stir it. Is there such thing as too long, like when seeds start to re-absorb water?

- The ideal temperature and light/dark exposure to keep it at while extracting.

- If I should add anything to the solution to facilitate extraction. Some recipes I've read call for herbs, citrus juice, alkaline powders, etc.

- The best way to strain out the plant material without losing any potency. 

- Once the alkaloid-rich solution is evaporated, is the resulting solid matter straight-up opium that I can toss into my bowl, or do I have to refine it?

I generally only have money for dope in patches, maybe for 10 days out of every 30, and I'll use hard for those 10 days.  For example, I'll shoot 2 buns of fire in my veins every day for a week, then jump back on subs for 3 weeks until the next time I'm flush.

Does 'done cure the crave that much more than sub? Cuz right now, subs are really barely cutting it for me.  They only touch on my physical addiction, but are doing NOTHING for my mental addiction.
I'm amenable to meetings, but have a healthy distrust of psychiatry and would prefer not to be put on any other meds-definitely not going to go the SSRI route.  Would switching over to methadone do anything to subside my weekly cravings to run to the nearest ghetto and cop?
Or would it be the same old game?

Has any one done suboxobe and methadone long term? Pros and cons to both?

Using on top of your methadone, very interested in people thst use ontop. How much do you find it blocks out other opiates, and are some good combos?

This won't be a all the time thing, I haven't touched any opiates since being on subs, but I know of people using over there 'done, so id like to give it a shot.

Also would you say there is a more prominent 'lift' / 'buzz' with methadone over suboxone?

I am very familiar with shooting roxy 30's but never have done these. I was told they may gel up a little and I am not exactly happy with that idea. 

Also I'm in EMS schooling and don't want my veins darkening. My instructors will know.

Maybe I should just hold off a couple days until I get some roxy's; I don't know, I do have the itch now.

Any info, guidance, or advice would be real helpful. Thanks.

Edit: Google wasn't helpful. I need real, advice that I feel safe-ish taking.

Update: A big thank you to the replies. I was able to receive sound advice and a nice rush. 
 Although I very rarely post or comment in this sub, I can feel somewhat safe and confident (after a little fact checking). I've been a NREMT-B for a couple years since I've been out of the Army, and I'm in the middle of Paramedic school. The reason I bring this up is; There is (for the most part) two schools of thought, when giving meds to ""drug seekers"". One says, ""hell no, I'll transport and drop."" The other (my instructors and one day me), are ""My Pt is in pain, I don't care what their motive, as long as I alleviate that pain and treat my Pt on the ride to the receiving facility."" A lot of these ""drug seekers"" are in legit hell and it's unsafe and unethical (in my opinion) to withhold treatment. 
So, that being said. I have noticed, the general population of this sub-reddit is a good group of people. Who, out of no personal gain and what seems to be purely altruistic motives, care about the overall safety and well being of a complete stranger. I just wish others could see that.
   I can say 'altruistic' comfortably because a couple months ago I was having a bad time with PTSD. All it took was me to mention it on this sub and my inbox was flooded with messages. Although I kinda fell off the map (school and work will do that), those messages helped. 
 Keep being great people. Regardless of your/my drug of choice. 

TL/DR: Great group of people here and I'm glad I'm one. ",1360370854.0

Mainly cause u guys are all rilly cool as fuck! And as i am sure u will all tell me this question is one only i can answer and one can only quit if they want to and for themselves, yadda yadda. I know this. 
Bit of a potted history of use: started at 20 (now 30) started by smoking h, and moved onto IV after 16-18 months. During this time was producing a documentary aybout a famous singer and his new (at the time) band. Use of H was something he was famous for, and living on thier tourbus for 22 months and then in the edit for 6 H was part of daily life and became 'normal' without preventing working (too often) so doco wrapped and after the screening i worked as a PA to the director of doco. He was older, and use continued aided by him supporting my habit whilst using himsef. He has since admitted this was a way of ""keeping me close to him"" (he was 47 at the time. Fast fwd another year and i decide to quit my tv job, quit london and quit drugs. Move back in with parents, sign up with Dr, got on subs and successfully quit. And i stayed clean for 2 yrs. Another relationship ended around this time and istarted scoring for the 1st time in my hometown. Was using for 6 months and several failed quits later i meet another guy, on that 1st day told him everything, he was not put off (despite not using opis himself he had a pretty full on coke habbit for over 2yrs) so we start dating and i quickly realise he is the one. I go back on subs and really try to quit but fall off the wagon every now and again. Gets serious with guy  i shall call him whip. I meet and fall in love with his son, move into his house and i start a job (min wage, retail) Whip drives me to/frm work often, as was over ten miles from our home, supports me and we become a little family. O get a better job, so does he there are good times and bad. The bad generally being when i use, lie about it and he finds out later. But we work thru this together. I once even took out a small payday loan to cover my spending on H, used his acc details as the backup acc, he gets charged an admin fee and still forgives me. More time passes and i apply for a job in a city far away and i get it. I never thought i would, am so excited and start planning to move etc. Whip again supports this, but he is not happy. So during my 2nd week of new job he finishes with me. I m distraught but really want to make this job work as it is in tv and feels like my career is back on track. But am miserable and soon start seeking h in new city. Crack is a lot more avail so am soon using both heavily. Whip calls after a few months and we start over, but i dont tell him about my use, i vow to quit, but dont get round to it. As we only see each other at weekends i can hide it from him. The use takes a toll on my work, and i am soon using my company credit card for personal use, turning up late, being an arse. Boss finds out, get fired. Still dont tell Whip, it was his sons birthday the following weekend and my plan was to get thru that and then take a huge dose and Od. I partially succeded but was found by housemate and rushed to ER. Now Whip, family and friends all 
Know what has been going on. I spend the next 2 months totally alone in new city living as a junkie not working etc. After xmas family contact and say they will supportme if i want to quit. I agree and start on subs bur continue using behind all backs. Whip calls and we have a v emotional reunion with him saying lets be friends and take it from there. Then my aunt calls and offers her financial support. I have lost everything, fucked all these people over multiple times and they are all there for me, but i dont stop, despite telling  them i have. I dont know what to do, i WANT to quit but i dont. I know this ismy absolute last chance with them all.. I dont deserve this to be honest. 
So after all that and if anyone is still reading my question is; why cant i stop when for the 1st time everybody knows and they are all so desperate and willing to help. I want to quit, i know if i dont i will loose everything i care for and will not come back, i am ready to quit in so many ways, i have had ten yrs of gettin high and for the 1sy time i can honestly say opis have lost their allure and i have fallen out of love with them and the lifestyle. Yet each day i use abd put off quitting for another day and promise myself tomorro wil be different, but tomorro never comes? 
So what to do? Can anyone offer advice/perspective? ",1360352632.0

What are some favorite songs?,"**Pete Doherty** of Babyshambles/The Libertines is the most recent one for me. I'm in the US so I hadn't heard his music until maybe six months ago. I think he's an absolute genius. Awesome music, brilliant poet. When I heard the music for the first time and found out he's a heroin addict I read a bunch of articles about him, he's infamous in England, and vilified by the media, for his exploits and addiction, in and out of rehab, criminal charges, etc. Fascinating. I really dig Pete Doherty.


[Babyshambles - Sedative](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWav-thOE4)


""sedative.. is my hero
...
it's been a long long time since i stepped outside""






**Elliott Smith** will always be my favorite. His poetry evokes so much familiar despair and depravity. Well, the songs about heroin do. Not all his music is on that subject. All his music is great. Amazing guitarist and composer. The complexity of his songwriting never ceases to amaze me. So much respect for him as a guitarist. Fuckin' talent. Music lost a lot when he died.

I can't be myself, I can't be myself
and I don't want to talk
I'm taking the cure
so I can be quiet wherever i want

so leave me alone
you ought to be proud that I'm getting good marks""






**Kurt Cobain**, of course. I've been reading up on him lately, watching interviews and stuff, what a cool dude. I've loved Nirvana since I was a little kid. Always knew he was a drug user, can't remember if I found out he was a heroin user before or after i got into opiates, but his music has a new meaning for me now.


[Nirvana - Drain You](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkqjx6Gsh0U)


""you're my vitamins""






**John Frusciante** is one of my favorite and best guitarists of all time.


And **Lou Reed** is just a total legend. 

**Ray Charles** and **Miles Davis**.




I guess these are all pretty well known, but if you haven't heard Elliott Smith or Pete Doherty you should definitely check them out.

I'm not sure about this, but I've heard **Julian Casablancas** is/was/something into heroin.. does anyone know anything about this? The Strokes fuckin' rock. I hate when people act like their music isn't good because it's popular. 

SO, who are your favorite musician lovers of the poppy plant? What are your favorite songs on the subject? Who are some not so well known musicians that use/used to?

I had bronchitis and the doctor prescribed a narcotic cough syrup. Even though I was very young I was already depressed to the point of having suicidal thoughts. At that point most of the *really* bad shit hadn't happened yet so I can't quite say why...but I guess biology certainly wasn't on my side since both parents were clinically depressed and my paternal grandmother chose suicide instead of a life of sadness. 

When I took the cough syrup I finally felt happiness. It felt like someone had walked in to my life and turned on the sun...I could finally understand what people meant by the word ""joy"".

Lets leave aside for the purposes of this conversation all the reasons why it's a bad idea and just discuss it.

Firstly, I believe that less is more, and I usually only take about .5 mg per day of the stuff (.15-.25 every 12ish hours). If I am coming off gear, ill give myself an extra dose, so that's .75/day. I don't exceed it. I don't know how many other people really take their Subs this way..

So I took .2 of Sub around 7 am and I plan on doing a couple bags IV around 3 pm (if all goes according to plan) with no real blockage. Normally I would have skipped the 7 am dose, but I just transitioned back onto Sub on Monday after a 3 week run so I'm still a little sick ish.

Anyone else find that seemingly magical way to take sub that allows you to chip and still get 90%+ of the rush? I know compared to my friends who don't use sub, I nod harder on less dope, and euphoria is there too. I always do an extra bag though than I would do if I wasnt a sub maintenance patient.

Has it been your experience as well that most opiate users are usually smarter/deeper thinking individuals? I have thought this for a while but never really heard anyone ever talking about it. It got me thinking that maybe people who are anxious about the world around them (whether it be over-thinking about everything or just being science-minded people) are more prone to opiates because of how much they calm our ever-thinking minds down and just let us be entranced in our thoughts/escape from the world that we understand is so shitty/calculated.

**TL:DR - It seems most of the people I have met in the opiate culture are smarter/thinking individuals..

So, I started with 1 and a half, then another half, then another, then another. So I've taken 240mg tonight..and I am FUCKED. I feel like it's about to hit me hard and I'm gonna be nodding all fucking night.

I'm trying to do the math..I feel like each 80 is equivalent to 4 bags, which would cost me about 30 bucks normally. On top of that, each 80 lasts 2-3x longer than a shot would, so I'm gonna call it 8 bags an 80 being conservative.  So, it's basically like getting a bun for 20 bucks.

If you could get OP 80's for this cheap, would you make it your primary way to get fucked up?  I haven't even tried the crush and crisp method yet..how well does that work?  How many good shots (equiv to 3-4 bags of ECP) could I get off 1 80?

Finally, anyone else get any killer deals?  What is the best deal you've gotten?  For me, it would be the kid who had no idea what he had, and sold me roxies for a buck a pill. I got 120 for 120 bucks, and bought him a nice $30 meal cuz I felt hella guilty. His grandma passed away, he found 121 of them, tried 1 and HATED it. Said he felt like he had ""sand in his dome."" I was happy to take them off his hands. Anyone else get any once in a lifetime deals like this?",1361173732.0

What are your tricks when you are dry and want to stave off w/d or even catch a nod? We all know about soaking cottons, but I was thinking of some other creative things people do. I was reading that thread about that junky who posted on the usenet thread who mentioned:

* Cornering - Saving a little bit of your dope in the corner of the bag and stashing it for later when you're dry and emptying all the bags together. 

and more from experience/reading:

* Scraping bags - I've never been able to do this with BTH but I guess people who use ECP can scrape their stamp bags to get a little? Can anyone expand on this for me?

* Rig caps - This is my personal favorite, but I use the cap of my rig as a mixing tool for shots of BTH (edit - I use the cap as a tool to stir it with as opposed to the needle). This will sometimes leave a little bit of BTH stuck in the indentation in the top of the cap and some dried gunk around the edges. Once I'm out, I'll scrap this and cook it up and BAM, an extra one or two nice shots!

* Spoon shots - This is a little dirtier, but sometimes when cooking BTH your spoon will retain some of the gunk/cut in it, or just dried up residue from old shots. If you shoot in a fairly sterile environment, I sometimes will just leave the residue in a spoon to save it for a desperate time and end up just mixing water in making a shot out of that. 

* Towel shots - This one is probably just something I do, but might as well mention it. I use a paper towel to place my spoon on when cooking shots at home. So all my prep work happens over this paper towel. Sometimes bits fly here and there, sometimes good H splashes a little here and there, and after a few months the area around the spoon will begin to absorb so much junk that in VERY desperate times, I've ripped up little pieces of it and soaked those and gotten pretty good buzz, if not just getting rid of W/D's. This is kind of a desperate one though.

Ok that's enough for now, anyone else have any tips or tricks??

<.....finally, the PA comes in and sits down to talk to me. I see youre not sleeping well, and your mobility is extremely poor. You've doubled up on your medications, tested positive for hydrocodone twice, and you showed up once with absolutely nothing in your system. What can i do for you.

First of all, i told them each time that i would test positive for hydrocodone. My wife tossed me a few when i needed it. Second, i showed up with nothing in it because they moved me from 60mg a day to 20mg a day, and i wasnt having that so i took my normal 60mg a day and ran out in the first week like 3 days early.(40 count, 5mg, 4x day(was taking 3 per dose time so 12x pills/day).)

""Back the mack truck up for a second here...you guys are the cause for this shit. Albeit by my own doing that those results came back, however, by your actions of undermedicating you've forced me into a position that im unwilling to back down from.""

how, might you ask?

* I was on 15mg x4/day for 7 months prior to entering their care.

* They immediately cut me down from 15mg x4/day to 5mg x4 day. Im hoping you all realize the fail written all over this move.

* Realizing this didnt work, they moved me up to 7.5/325mg 4x/day

* I cannot take the apap. Ive had acute renal failure(body doesnt process it well. I can take it, just not extended like this). He tells me its processed through the liver. Fuck me right? It must be their medical history and their body. This was explicity said to them, and its nowhere in my record there.

* My upper back hurts so bad, i cant breathe at times. I call them for recommendation, they dont call back for 32 hours. Told them i took an extra pill for 4 doses. Got mad and told me not to, didnt bother to ask how i was doing. This wasnt in their records either.

* Next, they decide to put me on mscontin 30mg. Fuck, this is worse than the 7.5's. No pain relief what-so-ever. Double em up, 60mg 2x/day. fuck yea. Im dancing with my kids and throwin em around enjoying my life the way i was meant to.

* go in for follow up with a chip on my shoulder about this place already. tell them i doubled up on the meds because they suck dick and i want out of my contract so i can get somewhere with competent doctors who understand pain management and arent afraid of the DEA. Write me a referral.

* so they write me one detailing all the bad shit from my record there, but neglect to write in their infractions.

* Ive been to the ER about 10 times in 4 months because i cant get on top of my pain without taking double my dosage. No longer able to be treated at ER for my back. 

To top it off i wasnt given anything to jump off this shit with so i had to endure the wonderful wd's again. thats twice since ive been here, and ive never had that before in 4 years.

This facility has effectively destroyed my medical history for any future pain management doctor i may come in contact with in the next few years. If theyd have just kept me on the same fucking medications i came in with, everything wouldve been fine and half of this shit avoided 100%. Theyve reduced the quality of my life by 85-90%. The last week ive been bed ridden for 5 days and slept most of that time away. Ive missed work and school not to mention the time spent with my kids, wife, etc.

Fuck the east coast. This place is fucking garbage. Never had these problems out west.

Other input is also always appreciated.","So I legitimately take what I think is called Norco 10mg, they are yellow ovalish pills. I take 5-6 a day depending on pain, most days is 6, 3 doses of 2 a day. 

Please correct me if I am wrong but my pain is caused from cartlidge that is missing between my L4 and L5 vertabrae, and spinal stenosis. I also have nerves in my back that are pinched which cause numbness in my legs, on one side down to the knee and sometimes below and the other just usually to the thigh. 

I have had this problem for around 13 years now since I was in middle school. I have had multiple MRI's as well as doing physical therapy multiple different times, acupuncture, water physical therapy, massage, non narcotic pain relief, muscle relaxers, and basically anything else you can think of. For a while I even had the trainer for the Detroit Pistons as my personal physical therapy trainer. I have tried Morphine Sulfate, Opana, Oxycodone, and vicodin. The only thing that seems to work so far is the 10mg.  

I saw a surgeon when I was around 18 and he did not want to operate at that time because I was so young and they said the best thing would be to wait for medicine to progress since I was young, they wanted to do spinal fusion if anything which also makes me nervous. I am also going back to see him April 6th to see what he has to say now.

I see an internist which I have had since I was 12 and he prescribes the pain meds and monitors my liver and blood work. I saw him the first week of November and he wrote the usual script with 3 refills. I do not have insurance so it is pricey but I can not work/sleep or function like a normal person in society with the pain.

I moved this week and either someone stole my prescription bottle or I lost it. I am an optimist so I prefer to think it got lost in the shuffle. Before you say no one would be that careless with important meds. I keep a week supply with me to go back and forth to work to not have to carry the big container and look weird to co workers. I also had help packing from my girlfriend, and she would never touch the stuff, she hates and wishes I didn't have to take it at all.

So i called my Dr. office, I have my normal appointment 13 days from now and I tried to see if I could move it up because of this and he is out of town.   So my question to you is, without insurance, so I can't waste a bunch of money going to the ER or urgent care unless results come from it, and I did not file a police report to say I might have lost my script with only 13 days of 30 left anyway. What is the best legitimate way to replace this. I don't wish to purchase from the street because I like to keep everything in the legal health system even though that seems to sometimes mean I have to be firm and fight for my rights as a patient with actual pain.

Sorry for the wall of text, I would love any input anyone has on replacing it, also if anyone with similar problems has had the fusion or similar surgery I would love to hear your story.  I have had 2 friends go through it with poor results, same pain level different location and tons of medical debt.

My heart-rate is usually extremely lowered from the intense beating within about 15 minutes after dosing, and as I said, this doesn't happen even close to every time (I am a daily IV user and this happens maybe once a week, and seems to happen with better quality dope).

 Months and months ago, some time last year I made a post about the ""worst way you ever lost opiates?"" That was because that day I had picked up a half gram of some dank tar and somehow lost it on the drive home. I knew it was in the car somewhere because I didn't stop or get out or anything before I got home ... after a while of fruitless searching everywhere it could have fallen (under/around the passenger seat), I pretty much gave up on it. I knew that it *might* have still been in there, but there was no way I could take my car apart to the point that our worker just did.

Today, after having nothing but a few subs since Sunday,  I'm getting my car serviced because of some problem with the water leaking into some other part of the car. Our worker at my job was a mechanic before, so this was done on site by him. I come out to look -  lo and behold: I see something small and white just sitting there stuck in a crevice ... It was the plastic the half was wrapped in; not closed completely but it was pretty much all there. I was SO completely overjoyed! I literally just got out of the bathroom after a bunch of chasing the dragon. If you guys lose shit in your car, I think more often than not it may show up again if you look hard enough ... don't give up hope! 

TL;DR - the best opiates are the ones that you lose, never expecting to see again - but then somehow make it back into your life!

Someone I live with is very nice (and very responsible with her meds, unlike me) and helps me out by giving me ""crumbs"", slices of her 60MG morphines, which amount to between 20 to 5MGs a day, but no more than 20MG on any given day. When I have nothing else, this isn't a lot but I'm really, really grateful for it and wouldn't dare risk fucking that up by stealing her stuff or manipulating her to give me more or sell me any.

Anyway, so the morphine doesn't work all that well and when I started this 10 days go, I'd take it in the mornings and be sick by noon, so take tramadol and loper and just sort of *deal* with the rest of the day.

Over the last 10 days though, I've started taking *less* of the morphine every day, less loper and one dose of tramadol instead of two or three. Last night, I took the one dose of tramadol and *damn it hit me hard!* I only took 200MGs and I was flying.

*Ho-lee shit*. I have a *huge* tolerance normally, but now it's all gone! I didn't have to take ANY morphine, tramadol or loper today and I don't feel sick at all!

Without even trying, or realizing it was happening, I realized I can QUIT! I'm not ready to, though... but just knowing that by managing myself through weaning and taking care of my bowels and brain with loper & tramadol, I really have a fighting chance and this makes me SO happy.

I haven't *not* used -- aside from withdrawaling of a few hours or a day max in **ten years**. You have no idea how much of a revelation this all is for me!

However, today I got my 10/325 hydro script and on the fifth I get my roxy script. I only just now took 15mgs of vicodin (previously that would be *ehhh*), and I got the script three hours ago. In about a month I'm going to be moving, and I'm thinking about coming clean then -- I don't want to go to a new place and have my first thought be *where can I cop, what can I get... please let me not get sick...* and since my tolerance is way low and I have no withdrawal or physical desire to use -- just mental habit at this point -- I'm going to take a lot less than normal and try to keep my tolerance down.

I'm almost ready /r/Opiates, to quit the opiates. Please wish me luck! Does anyone have further advice about how I can manage the mental aspect of wanting it though? I wasn't even craving badly today when I got my script, and felt I'd be fine w/o it if I knew I wasn't getting it. Maybe I should tell my doctor I'm quitting? No subs for me though!

Thanks everyone, this is a great community full of helpful people. Some of you I've gotten to know personally and I'm glad of that.

The first pickup I had was just morphine, I crush and insufflate anything opiate wise except nucynta,hydrocodone,and codeine. \

My latest pickup (tonight) was 2 100mg morphine and 4 4mg dilaudid

I've heard dilaudid is pretty high up on the effectiveness scale, so my question is ""What is the most effective way to use dilaudid?""

Is crushing and insufflating the best, swallowing whole, or crushing then swallowing?

The dilaudid is the 54 196 imprint pills.

Another question, what is a normal price to be paying for 100mg morphine (imprint M / 100) and 4mg dilaudid (imprint 4 / 54 196)

I generally sleep horribly on opies. It's part of the reason I still use sporadically, despite having a pretty strong and steady craving for the little bastards. Benzos are obviously the go-to in this situation, but I can't take those anymore. Ambien too, except for that fact that it's hard for me to find. Benadryl used to work but is losing it effectiveness for me. The same goes for melatonin. 
So now I come to you, the good people of r/opiates, for some advice. What are some things you've done that I might be able to do to get some shut eye. Getting more drugs is not an option for me at this point. Other than that I can't think of any constraints. Any ideas? Thanks.

They're the night time embrace of a lover that won't divorce you; all the paychecks from your employer that weren't eaten up by bills and taxes; it's the real graduation certificate that was magically supposed to make you a notch above the rest. 

In short, I feel like being high on opiates is what the human game SHOULD feel like. I'm normal and healthy and happy when I'm high. Yes, yes. I know that's the trap and sets the long hard road towards addiction. I've managed it effectively for years. 

It's such a crude and rudimentary way to feel normal, but those glimpses of bliss are sure hard to ignore. ",1361675016.0

Going into college, I was excited to move on in life and see what college had to offer, but as time has progressed, I'm less and less into it (still only a freshman). Last semester, I was pretty bummed, because so many of the people I met were just trying to get fucked up all weekend and act like fools (this may be due to going to a state school); I got this out of my system in high school, and it seemed to me most of these people with that mindset here were sheltered kids that lacked my experience in life prior to college that now were making up for it. I'm social and funny when I try to be, and made a lot of friends, but most of the people and situations just don't seem to be worth it to me. I have parties I could go to with people and stuff, and when I do, I regret it and think of how stupid it is. This leads me to doing opiates by myself, and building up a dependence on the opiates, so that even though I'm not physically addicted, my brain is addicted in the sense that I'm usually more sad without them. I've always been big into skateboarding, and look at friends back home that haven't gone to college right away that are getting sponsored and doing what they love with jealousy; back home, i didn't do opiates too much at all; it supplemented my life a couple times a month. All I needed was to go to the skatepark for hours all day, or film in the streets for full length videos with friends, for me to feel so fulfilled. 

Now, bored as shit with nothing to do at college and not wanting to go to parties on the weekend, I'd rather do opana by myself or with one or two other people. It just depresses me to see that I'm doing this out of boredom and not being happy with what I'm doing in life, which leads me to feeling down a lot and like a waste. I've been thinking about a year off, or going to community college to save money, as it seems like this college isn't the one for me. I realize degrees seem to be necessary to make a good amount of money unless you want to get into a field like carpentry or plumbing, but money isn't too important at this young age, and while that is due to my parents supporting me, I want to be able to skateboard and do what I love for a while before I have to dedicate myself to a career and making money (no one here skates, so I don't really want to just skate by myself that much. I still do sometimes, but not much at all). I'm getting deeper into opiates and don't want to continue slipping down this slope, and want to be happy doing the things I love still; we have time to grow up and go to college and get a real job, but I don't see what the rush is between me graduating at 22 years old or me at 23 years old if I took a year off. 

I talked to my mom about wanting to take a year off and I can tell she's so disappointed in me, and I feel like a piece of shit. I wish she could see it from my perspective as I'm not happy here and don't feel like there's anything going on here to get excited about. I don't know what I want to do and this is a really expensive state school and I don't even have a major, and feel like I'm wasting my parents money right now. I was thinking about being a history teacher, in which case I should be at a closer college to my home that is known for its excellent teaching program along with being almost half as cheap as this college. I don't know why I posted this, but I just had to vent somewhere and feel like you guys might be able to relate or offer me advice; I don't like talking to my friends about it because everyone wants to continue going to college, acting like this is the best place/thing to ever happen to them, while I feel like it's the worst for me.",1361661999.0

I've been using IV for a couple of months (insufflating for much longer). I got careless at the beginning and really fucked up both my arms.

But there is a bunch of scar tissue around the area and I can't see/find veins around there anymore (and am a little scared of using that spot again anyway, I had some DVT, etc).

I spent a while hitting the veins in my hands--those work ok, but the veins are so small I find that I miss maybe 1 out of 5 shots, and those misses really hurt--my hands blow up for a like a week, and I'm getting scared to use those veins--I'm starting to get bumps that take much longer to go away and it is a very visible part of my body.

I'm not super overweight, but I've definitely got a couple of extra lbs. That makes it hard for me to find veins elsewhere on my body. I've searched forearms, thighs, legs, etc, but I can't seem to find anything that is clearly a vein.

I have tried tricks like drinking lots of water, doing a bit of exercise beforehand, etc, but nothing really seems to help.

I've tried everything which eventually leads me to try my oxycodone I was prescribed for my tonsillectomy. This obviously takes the pain away. In september i decide to go through my primary doctor to see what's wrong. He refers me to an ortho who refers me to a pain management doctor who then refers me to a neurologist. I have that appointment soon I hope... Basically I have been through everything and they cannot figure out what is wrong. The only thing they have come up with is possibly brain sag.. So through all this time I have not been prescribed anything for the pain. Literally nothing. I have had X-rays, mris, had multiple injections and did three months of physical therapy.. Is this normal? I don't know what to do. The pain is killing me and I can't afford to buy on the streets so basically I just deal with it unless I get lucky and get something like a couple Vicodin.

I hope you enjoy the story, and maybe take from it a little bit of inspiration to add some care and safety to your own habits. Before I start, let me just say that even though what happened seems like a suicide attempt, it was more an accident brought on by - to be completely frank and honest - insanely irresponsible and stupid abuse of drugs.

About a week or so ago, give or take, I woke up and started my usual routine. As I've said in previous posts, I have an absolutely insane habit and tolerance. I usually shoot between four to eight Opana IR 10 mg pills in one sitting or two to four MSContin 100 mg pills. Even using a 3 ml rig, I'll find myself shooting three or four shots back to back, making all of them at once then banging all of them as fast as I can. I've never overdosed, never fallen out even. (Well, at least not with pills... As a younger man, with heroin, that is a different story.)

I'm not proud of the size of my tolerance, even if I sometimes wear it as a badge of honor. When I make rounds for friends, I call them ""big boy shots,"" and take a certain degree of humor from watching their reactions to the massive histamine, pins and needles reaction a large shot of MSContin can produce. I don't give them anything near a dangerous level of opiates - I have enough red on my hands, I don't need anymore dead friends. But these ""big boy shots"" have become a bit of legend in my circle of junkies.

What went down on the day of my overdose is this. The night before I had lucked into a bottle of 10 mg Ambien. Normally I stay away from benzos and benzo-esque pills, but a friend gave them to me and talked me into shooting one. It produces a unique rush, and an odd, dissociative, almost hallucinogenic high, albeit very short-lived. The major downside is that after one shot - in me at least - it starts a crack-like fiending for another shot plus a quick decent into, well, to put it mildly, doing a lot of stupid shit with no memory of it at all.

So, that morning, before I prepped my usual Opana and MSContin shots, I decided to add a bit of Ambien in the mix. There were 26 pills in the bottle before I started, and - once again, very, *very* stupidly - I decided to put not one, not two, not three, but four of those goddamn things in a rig. The last thing I can remember is pulling the rig out of my vein and pressing a cotton ball to the site.

What happened next is a bit of a puzzle, but one constructed from notes I took while doing my business and phone calls I made over the next hour. I, almost fetishisticly, record the amount and time of every shot I take in a notebook I keep with my gear. The notes stopped after the third round of 400 mg of MSContin, but more than twenty pills were missing from my stash. That's 2000 mg plus of morphine, not to mention at least 800 mg of Opana and the remainder of the Ambien. Obviously not all made it into my body - I imagine a great deal was spilled - but a god-awful lot of opiates went into me.

At some point in the process I wrote in my notebook the following, which fucking haunts me: ""Please don't think this is an accidental overdose. I know what I'm doing. We all have to die of something.""

Eventually, I passed out. For how long, I don't know. I only know that my phone showed a number of calls to friends who didn't answer, with the exception of my ex-girlfriend. She tells me that she could tell from my voice that I had done something incredibly stupid, so she immediately drove to my house, from her apartment about ten minutes away.

According to her, once she got here, I was barely breathing, cold to the touch, and turning blue. She immediately put two strips of 8 mg Suboxone under my tongue then called 911. She also cleaned everything up before the paramedics arrived.

They loaded me up in the ambulance and rushed me to the nearest hospital. Apparently I had a seizure on the way, but that was the least of my problems.

Even after naloxone was administered in the ER, I was still cyanotic and unresponsive. The doctors believe that was due to a combination of the sheer amount of morphine in my body, plus damn near a month's worth of Ambien. I was intubated and taken to the ICU, where I stayed for three days before I woke up. According to the nice doctor, he had never seen anyone with such an irresponsibly insane amount of opiates in their system. In conversation with him, he bluntly wondered aloud at the damage I've been doing to, ""Your whole fucking body."" He said he honestly thought I would either never wake up, or at the very best, awake with massive brain damage.

Luckily, I proved him wrong...

Still though, even after I was awake and fully functioning in ICU, I was put in the psych ward, on a suicide watch. I spent three days telling the shrinks that despite what I had written (my ex had supplied my dosing journal at the request of the doctors), I wasn't suicidal, just really fucking stupid. They disagreed, and repeatedly begged me to go into their residential rehab program, but, since I'm here writing this, I obviously declined.

So, I'm back. I'm here. I'm not dead. I'd like to thank everyone who sent me messages and phone calls asking if I was okay. I don't keep many close friends in the real world, so its nice to feel a bit of love coming from some of the members of this great community. For those wondering, yes, I'm back to my old shooting regimen, albeit a bit toned down. I'm also back to staying away from benzos and their brethren.

The main reason I'm sharing this story goes back to what I wrote... ""We all have to die of something."" That's true. I've seen overdose deaths, gun-shots, a fatal stabbing. I preformed CPR on my father as his lungs finally gave out. As a teenager, I even found a friend who hanged himself... What I'm getting at is that I'm no stranger to death. I think most addicts will, at some point, realize that their lives are always walked on the razor's edge between this world and whatever comes next. That's okay, I think. I think that's just the part of the price we pay to play with these amazing, beautiful, deadly, destructive molecules.

The point I'm trying to make though, is this... While we all have to die of something, be smart and try not to let it be by this. Limit your dumb-ass choices. Don't dance so close to the fire, because if it consumes you, there is no second dance.

So, please everyone... Be careful out there.

**TL;DR - I once lost a ring fingering my high school girlfriend. That's nothing though... A buddy of mine lost a watch once. Just read the damn thing. Or not. I don't care. I'm going to bed.**

*Note - Future posts will get back to the more fun and less somber shit than this. I promise.*
 
**SUPER EDIT** Thanks everyone for your kind words and compliments. It does my ego a lot of good to hear that people enjoy my posts and stories, and even more so to hear that people don't want me to, well, you know... fuckin' die. These kind words do actually mean a lot to me, so thank you, everyone.

About the stupidity of shooting Ambien, that was one of the things the hospital staff was really kind of amazed about. In my area, if you're shooting, you're shooting meth, and one of the nurses actually told me that she considered shooting Ambien right up there in with that in terms of bad choices. I had a few conversations with nurses and doctors about what the effects and feelings of an Ambien shot were, and without a doubt, every person I talked to about it was either amazed that I did it or really curious as to how it felt. I don't advise anyone to try it, even if you're desperate to shoot *anything,* just bang some water. After one Ambien shot, your memory and decision making abilities go right out the window. *(As a side note, the best part of this experience was probably getting the number of this super cute nurse who invited me to attend NA with her. She's told me she had an alcohol and coke problem for a few years and has been in recovery for two. Nurses are, without a doubt, responsible for the best sex I've ever had, so I'm hoping she'll be kind enough to thirteenth-step me. Hey, let a nigga hope, okay? Oh, the worst part... Fucking catheters. No one should ever wake up to discover a goddamn garden hose coming out of their penis.)*

Finally, I probably owe my life to Suboxone, in that it most likely reversed enough of the opiate-induced respiratory depression to get to to the hospital where a full antagonist could be administered. It was lucky that I had taught my ex that trick and even luckier that she was collected enough to remember it. If you don't have naloxone available to you, maybe consider keeping some subs around in case you overdue the dumb-dumbs like I did.

*One last thing... If there's interest, I'll post the story about how I got revenge on my so-called friends who dosed me with Suboxone about a month ago. I think the story was enjoyed by some of you, and the tale of revenge is pretty sweet. I'm writing it now, and will hopefully post it in the next few days. Once again, thank you all for your kind words and support. This is a nice little corner of the internet, and everyone here continuously makes me happy to have found it. Stay safe, and I hope everyone makes it to where they want to be.*",1362038797.0

To answer your question:  I never switched to heroin because I didn't have to.  There were always 80's available.  Plus I knew exactly how much I was taking.

I broke into someones house to steal their Fentanyl.  I tried so many times to quit and never could stay clean.

I managed to stay clean this time because my last run left me near death.  I met up w/ my dealer (for the 10th day in a row) and they took a look at me and said in a concerned voice 'whoah...you don't look so good.'  The daily fentanyl smoking had left my skin a green/grayish hue with a mottled, oily complexion.  Eyes sunken and completely emaciated I knew I couldn't do it anymore.  I had spent $5k in that short run and there wasn't a moment that I truly felt good.  I haven't wanted to feel that way since.

I've been on Suboxone since then.  It's a great drug but it is also physically affecting me.  I am tapering off, currently at 2mg.  I hope to be completely off by mid March.

I don't not envy any of you who are desperate for your next score.  Because I know exactly how you feel.  My first thought when I opened my eyes in the morning was 'take pills.'

Now my use costs me about $50 per week, much cheaper and if I don't use I don't become incapacitated. I work in a factory which is nice,  

A CONSERVATIVE estimate, over 5 years and counting of use, would be $50,000. Mainly on heroin. ",1362023736.0

I was just wondering how everyone here sleeps when on opiates?  I've been on a steady supply of Norcos/Oxys for about 6 months now with no breaks and i've noticed that I have weird sleeping patterns.  Like sometimes I wake up very early and can't go back to bed so i'll try to take a nap later but then end up tired and then by like midnight i'm ready to go to bed but my mind is like no not yet and then sometimes I am just ready for bed and don't want to do anything else.

Also i've noticed my dreams are very vivid.  Not only vivid, but just flat out weird.  

In the beginning I used to sleep like a baby on opiates, in fact it's a big reason why I was enjoying them so much cuz they would help me just easily fall asleep but now i'm to the point where the pills don't really get me ""high"" and they just make me feel normal so that might have something to do with it.

Either way, I am planning on kicking soon.  I know once that happens, even an hour of sleep will be a godsend.  I wish sleep was easier to come by lol.",1362012481.0

19ctv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/19ctv5/doctors_appt_tomorrow_question/,5,https://redd.it/19ctv5,PerculatingClouds,Doctors Appt tomorrow - question,"Hey all, quick (somewhat long) questions for you- been lurking for awhile and first time posting. I've been chippingly using opiates (percocet) for about a year on and off. I always obtain them legally (if you want to call it that) due to Degenerative Disc Disease (L4-L5), being clumsy as fuck and I do a lot of activities in which I bang myself up quite a bit/aggravate my back. I've managed to keep my tolerance roughly around 20mg - 30mg.


*To give a quick back-story in regards to my question - In November, I woke up one morning before work and felt like someone had taken an drop-kicked me in my right flank - felt like I completely tore a muscle. I was freaked about kidney stones so headed to my local Urgent Care. They found trace amount of blood in my urine and then took an x-ray for whatever reason. On the x-ray, they found a small ""spot"" on my right lung. The doctor immediately advised me to book an appt. with a Pulmonologist and wrote me a referrel for an MRI. Got the MRI done the very same day and was able to get an appointment with the lung doctor 2 days later. I was freaking out a little at this point as the word CANCER was flashing through my head like a broken stoplight. 

*Go to the Pulmonologist, who is an incredibly nice, older gentleman and he takes a look at my MRI and lets me know that it is more than likely scar tissue left over from when I had Pneumonia a few years back and not to worry. He diagnoses me with a partially torn or strained muscle in my flank area. I ask him (of course) what can I do about the pain (as it did hurt like a motherfucker). He writes me a script for T-3's, in which I tell him that from previous injuries, T-3's aren't very effective for me, he asks me what has worked in the past (every patients dream question) so I tell him Percocet is what's always worked best for me. He writes me a script for 50 5/325's, tells me to book a follow-up appointment in a month and I'm on my very-surprised and merry fucking way. 


*It was a fantastic month as I had no issue rationing 50. While I do take them because they feel great, I also do suffer from intense pain stemming from my pancaked disc.


*Fast forward to the beginning of January to the follow-up appointment. I went in hoping to maybe score another script but didn't have high hopes. I had unluckily (perhaps luckily) fallen awkwardly on my ribs a few days before while giving my dog a bath (as I said, I'm clumsy as fuck) and it had left a nice fat bruise on my ribs. The appointment went fine, I told him about the rib injury, he checks it out, tells me that's unfortunate, and writes me a prescription for 60 more 5/325's and says to book another appointment in 4-6 weeks.

*Now fast forward to today - I have my appointment with him tomorrow morning at 11am. Obviously, I would love another prescription as I ran out about 2 weeks ago. I suppose my question is what do you all think would be the best course of action in obtaining another prescription from him? I know rib injuries can take a bit to heal and I also just wanted others opinions. i do appreciate any insight. 


tl;dr - I have another follow-up appointment with my Pulmonologist tomorrow. He's given me 2 nice prescriptions from the last 2 appointments I've had with him over the past 3 months. Wanted to see if I would be able to get another prescription at my appointment tomorrow. ",1362004200.0

My main question is if I take oxycodone intranasally, won't some of it also get absorbed orally? And if so, is that figured into the calculation? Or does some of the oxycodone not get swallowed due to clogged nasal passages or something? 

When they calculate fentanyl buccal BA, they combine the amount absorbed through the buccal and the amount that gets swallowed. Is this the case for the oxycodone numbers?

At first, I was flipping out, thinking I had to lock all my shit up or gtfo as soon as possible.  After hearing the real of it instead of the media hyped bullshit, I get it - yea, Opiates are addictive as fuck, yea, people lie, cheat, kill and steal to get them - but that doesn't mean ANYONE on Opiates IS that person.  People are still people, on drugs or not.  People that would steal and lie will do it even more to get drugs.  People that wouldn't might resort to it if they have to - but plenty of people live normal enough lives on it.

Doesn't make it ok.  Doesn't make it not shitty.  But it does make it human.  And human I can deal with.  Had a man to man chat with him, it went great.  I leveled with him, he leveled with me, why he's doing it, what's been going on in his life and shit.  Some of it sounded like the usual excuses an addict needs to explain why he does the shit he does, but he's also been through a lot of rough shit.  I get it, I get the escape of it.  He's really, really aware of where he's at, in spite of using.  Lately says he's only been using to keep from getting sick, until he can get on the meds to get off of it, go on vacation, get some sun, some life happiness instead of some drug happiness - hopefully stay off of it afterward.

I'm still keeping my guard up, obviously.  People lie, especially about the rough shit - but my thanks to all of you guys for helping me see the real of it instead of the bullshit.  Had a level headed talk about it.  He's going on some meds to get off of it in March, and I'm gonna be there for him, even though I barely know him.  He took the initiative himself to get on the rehab program, which is promising.

Long time /r/opiates lurker here, but I've got a question.

Just got my hands on 3 Opana ERs.  They are little round pink/peach pills with a 5 on one side, and an E on the other.  From what I understand these are the new formula 'non-crushables', is this correct?

I've never had oxymorphone, but I am fairly experience with other opiates.  My tolerance is probably middle of the road.  Double sized (10/750) percocets get me where i'm going.  I'll swallow one and snort half of one to get started (doing equivalent of 2 regular, round 5/325 orally and one more intranasal), then generally rinse and repeat every 2-3 hours after that.  I've IV'd low-grade heroin and dilly's at various times over the last 15 years, never developing a dependency.

I've looked up the different methods of breaking these out, and I wanted to get some opinions on what is the best way to take these.  I won't plug, but i'm down for any of the other routes of intake.  I'm also worried that if I try some of the complicated methods to IV i'll waste it.  What do you guys think?  Who has what experience with this? 

Is there a notable difference between the crisping and alcohol extract methods?  
should I just grind it into a fine powder and snort?  If so, can I do rails or should i do small bumps every 10 mins or so?

But last night, I snorted all 3 30's in my normal regular fashion, and I'd estimate that it was about an hour or so later, I was uncontrollably fucked up and nodding out.  I couldn't keep my eyes open to save my life.  I dip/chew when on opiates because I feel it ""potentiates"" the high.  Potentiate may be a bad word for it but, it makes me feel more fucked up, and give a little harder of a nod (if I even end up nodding)  I did not do anything different than I would any other time using.  I used the day prior to that as well, so there was no ""tolerance break.""  My question/thought is does anyone else, or has anyone else ever noticed this.  That sometimes for whatever reason, you just seem to get much higher than you normally do specifically when you're not upping a dose.  This happens to me from time to time - unfortunately, its pretty rare though.  The only thing I can think of that may have played some sort of role in it is I went skateboarding Wednesday and was fairly sore (Thursday) the day this happened.  If anyone has noticed that sometimes they just happen to get much much higher than they normally do (on your average or lower dose than normal), have you figured out why it happens  If there is even a real definate answer, or just luck of the draw?  I couldn't explain it and was just laughing with my room mate about how I could barely hold a conversation, hold my drink, keep my eyes open, do anything.  I could barely function without uncontrollably nodding out and its pretty rare for me to nod out from oxy even on a higher dose. (2-3 more 30's - roughly 6 in total)  I've probably repeated myself more than I needed to cause I just got lit and am praying to the opiate gods that I get to get my nod on like that again tonight!  Thanks for any answers or a possible theory.

TL;DR - Took a smaller than normal dose of oxy (snorted) ended up nodding out uncontrollably.  If Im lucky, I might get a light nod on 150mg~ oxy.  Anyone have a theory on why it is that I/you sometimes get much higher from a smaller dose of whatever it is your taking.  While all pre-use rituals are constant.  Nothing different was done in an attempt to potentiate the high.

UPDATE :  Today is day 3, same pills same dosage.  I'm high, and its been a little over an hour since I dosed.  I have a slight nod goin on off 90mg, that is if I just lay back and relax - but this is absolutely NOTHING in comparison to what I expierenced yesterday.  I'm still 100% cohereant and able to type this without nodding in and out of consciousness and taking several minute breaks inbetween words.                     ",1362192723.0

19kqej,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/19kqej/chronic_pain_patient_question/,8,https://redd.it/19kqej,pdxpain,Chronic Pain Patient Question,"So, about two years ago now, I was diagnosed with colon cancer and indeterminate colitis. I'm pretty young for this (23) and I was put on a myriad of opiates to assist with the pain. My doctor and I tried so many different combos of meds to try to minimize the adverse effects and to manage costs due to bizarre insurance coverage (my insurance covered a month supply of Exalgo 12mg for $15, but OxyContin 20mg month supply was $320).

Anyway, about a month ago I was finally realizing that the opioid therapy was giving me poor performance at school and so I went into my doctor and asked to start finding an alternative solution and to come off of a 200mg oxycodone per day dosage.

When I got the chart note from that visit, the diagnosis caught me off guard. It was ""Opioid Dependance"". Now, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that diagnosis synonymous with Addiction essentially? I've never had issue controlling my use of my medication (outside an occasional intranasal dosage when I needed the relief even quicker than taking it orally would have provided, but even then I just would take my normal dose and I never told my doctor about that).

I didn't bring it up then because I read that sheet after I left the office.  Since that appointment, I have found that a 10mg dose as opposed to 30mg treats my pain pretty well, and none of the mental cloudiness I was experiencing. I've essentially gone from 200mg per day to 20-30mg per day in the space of less than a month and I've experienced minimal withdrawal symptoms.

I guess my question is this: Is Opioid Dependance really the correct diagnosis for me? And when I go in for my next appointment, if I mention that the 10mg dose is preferable do you think I'll run into any trouble for suggesting that now that I have been labelled as dependent?

I'd like to combine the two. What are your tips for (relatively) safely combining imprecisely-dosed opiates (H, PST, a-Mf) with other drugs?","I like to get high and I don't want to die.

I've read everything in the sidebar, dug through all of the big online drug communities, and picked the minds of many drug using friends and the rare ""cool"" doctor. I'm left with little consensus regarding which drug combination and potentiation practices are worth it and which are too risky. Sure, everyone's mileage varies, experiences differ, and risk v. reward standards are based on unique priorities and beliefs. But I/we would benefit from gathering lots of input here, in one place. I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts and experiences concerning the following:

- Do you use benzos, muscle relaxers, or antihistamines in combination with drugs like heroin and PST (in other words, the stuff of inexact dosage)? The sidebar potentiation guide mentions these as options, as do similar lists floating all around the net. Following such guides, I have had *great* success potentiating the shit out of heroin, PST, and various painkillers with Zanaflex, Klonopin, Fenergen (promethazine), and hydroxyzine. Tonight I bumped 1 stamp of dope (ECP) over 6 hours and took 0.5mg Klonopin, and I feel pleasant and relaxed. This is the sort of dosage I stick with; never more that 0.1g of dope in a night, never more than 1.5mg clonazepam, 8mg tizanidine, 50mg hydroxyzine, 50mg promethezine, etc. Not all of these things in the same day, and whatever I take is spaced out so that the high stays fun and manageable, never too heavy. The nod is not for me.

But then I see an equal number of posts, comments, and articles, seemingly written by knowledgeable users, warning me to NEVER EVER mix any of this stuff with opiates because of huge CNS depression risks. Any benzo is too much. On this subreddit I've been scolded and berated for asking how much Klonopin is reasonable to take with a moderate dose of PST. I had a death wish, they said.

- When getting high on a new supply of imprecisely-dosed opiates, how do you gauge the parameters of your body's zone of safety? I'm talking about, for example, straight up getting into a new bag of dope and getting higher and higher over the course of the night, and also tweaking a high by adding a little of this and a little of that until the soup is perfectly spiced. Until recently I thought that how high I felt was a useful measure of intoxication, but I learned that this is very much not the case. I know to start small and titrate up over time, but if your level of highness doesn't tell you when to stop, what's your method for figuring it out?

- The seemingly universal goal of opiophiles is the pursuit of the nod, but I've also encountered many warnings that intoxication to the point of catching a solid nod (or even feeling a bit woozy in that heavenly, dopey way) can be a sign of being dangerously close to an OD. What's the relationship between the two? Are we really coming that close to danger each time we nod, or are there more cautious ways to achieve a stellar high?

- Even though poppy seeds range wildly in terms of potency, the internet seems to have reached the consensus that if you use more than 2 pounds of seeds to make tea and drink it all, you will die. What the fuck is this all about? Before encountering this figure I used 1.5 pounds a few times and got decently high, but certainly didn't feel too high and experienced no signs of slowed breathing or overdose. Is the 2 pound rule a total crock of shit or have I been reckless with PST? Given the varying potency of seeds, is there any way to figure out how much is safe to drink?

Chipping while remaining alive doesn't seem too hard. I just need a better grasp on where safety ends and danger begins. Thank you.

**Edit** - I'd really like to hear what doses you're working with. I'm assuming that some of the conflict among opi message board wisdom stems from some people referring to IVing a veteran's dose of tar by using the same language that others employ to reference a dainty baby's-first-bump of East Coast powder.

So, if I took a 4-8mg oral dosage of hydromorphone, it would be the equivalent of 10-20mg oxycodone..


Price wise, I can get hydros for $1.17/mg, and oxys for $1/mg.. however, because hydros require so much less, I could get high for $5-$10 instead of $10-20 ?

About a year ago I was getting pink Opana IR 10s (the 5 mg pills were blue, if that helps), then I switched to Dilaudid for a few months, just for a change of pace. When I switched back to Opana, every pharmacy in my area was carrying white pills (both 10s and 5s, just different imprints) instead of the pink.

The pink pills were slightly smaller than the white, needing less water to prepare into shots. They also made a cleaner looking solution than these white ones. What I'm getting at is I want my fuckin' pinks back.

So, does anyone know the story? Is there a pharmaceutical company that still makes the pinks, and if so, do you know the name? My Google-fu is weak on this one, so I need some help. My friendly, neighborhood drug dealer *(read: pharmacist)* will order the brand I want, but I can't just tell her, ""The pink brand, you simple cunt."" She said she needs the manufacturer's name, like TEVA, Watson, Mallinckrodt, and so on.

Any help?

Thanks all.

**TL;DR ---** Who made/makes the pink Opana IR 10s? Do they still make them? What be they mutha-fuckin' name?

**EDIT** --- Thank you everyone who informed me that the pink 10s and blue 5s are made by Endo Pharmaceuticals. Now, I'm thinking that Endo is responsible for the brand name pill and the white Roxanne Labs pills I've been getting are one of the generic types.

But how long can you deal with it? 

Thus my theory is this: many young addicts wouldn't be addicts if doctors took them seriously, if they hadn't been so desperate, they had to seek relief out where they could.  We have a wrong and fucked up system, and god (or whatever) help us if we ever seek proper help or get randomly drug tested.  The fuckery will continue.

TLDR; mismanaged pain has led to a rash of addiction in people 35 and under. ",1362610458.0

I don't currently have access to a precise vaporizer, however, I do roll cigarettes, and I've known it possible to smoke hash in this manner, perhaps If I dampened the temperature I can retain heat from the cherry to effectively vapourize the #4, which I actually attained.
I rolled a spliff, placed the powder in an elliptical fashion 3-4 cm away from the cherry and moistened the tobacco slightly. I smoked it traditionally until the cherry was about .5-1 cm. away from the powder and then puffed gently while inhaling the vapor on the outside of the roll with a straw, and I could see it bubbling and honestly, I'm kinda surprised it didn't burn up immediately, but I definitely got it to work.

We do not have a constant source and get a few pills about once a month.  We've been doing this for 1.5 years, my tolerance is pretty low.  I only ever do opiates and other drugs with him, and like to sit at home together and watch movies/play video games when high.

I'm worried about his behavior.  About a year ago he was prescribed 2 huge bottles of Vicodin for some minor back pain that usually only lasts 2-3 days.  He went through them really quickly, and more than once I've noticed his pinpoint pupils when we were hanging out and we had no plans to do opiates together.  I confronted him about it, and told him that my ex-boyfriend would get high and then lie about it (not on opiates), and that this was a huge trust issue for me.  He apologized and said that he did go a little crazy on it, but he saved enough to wean himself off without W/D, and all was fine.  He still occasionally gets Vicodin for his recurring back pain, but it's only a couple times a year, and very small amounts.

About a month ago, he was giving me a ride to work, and while I was getting ready, I heard him go into the container where he keeps the oxy's  (it makes a very distinct sound).  As we were driving, I asked him if he took some with him to work, and he said ""no"", and I said ""oh, I thought I heard the container open, I guess not"".  After a few minutes he said ""now that I think of it, I did grab a pill"".  I made a joke about his job probably being a lot more fun on painkillers, and dropped it at that.

Today I am hanging out at his place, and he's playing video games.  We used last night and are planning to use again tonight.  In the middle of the day, I hear him go into the container to take more, I assume.  

Is it too much to ask him to tell me that he's getting high, if he's the one who buys the pills?  I already told him this is a sore point for me from a past relationship.  I don't care that he's getting high, I don't care if he is high for 3 days straight, I just want him to tell me.  I'm worried that his tolerance is rapidly going up (I never actually see how much he takes, nor do I know how much he buys at a time).  Is this something I should even worry about?  How do I bring it up again without sounding judgmental?  Thanks for any help.

**Update:** Thanks everyone for advice, even though I know this is not a relationship forum, it's good to talk to people who understand the nature of opiates.  I talked to him, and he admitted to sneaking around with it, and made a good point that the couple of times he did tell me, I made jokes along the lines of him being a junky, or when he was getting a cold, that he was W/Ding.  I apologized and emphasized that I wasn't judging him, and I made a bad call to make him uncomfortable about his use.  He told me the amount he usually gets, and we are both still taking the same dose, so no tolerance issues.  He told me that in the future, he will tell me how many he gets, and will be open about when he takes them.  We discussed how ""nobody chips forever"" and agreed that trusting each other means keeping each other in the know about our use, so that if one of us gets out of control, the other person can make the decision to call that person out/end the relationship.  All is well, again, for now.",1362863590.0

Chew up the pieces of pill til they are all dissolved, then up the bum with something like an oral syringe.  Sure the syringe smells like ass and it is kinda gross, but it is easy to do and effective.  I have no issues with ""leakage"".

Heres my question.  This is supposed ot be 30-40% availability compared to 10% oral.  What is happening to the other 60% ?  I think acid is neutralized by this point, so the OM isn't destroyed..  I assume the OM is expelled the next time a log is going out the chute.  I can imagine the pill snot being dehydrated and not as effective.  OM is quite water soluble, so putting water in my colon should help extract it out of the pill snot and into the water which will be absorbed by my colon.

  Having the pill snot rehydrated should make it more mobile and have it interact more with the cell walls of my colon.  So I take my oral syringe and give myself a dose of pure water after about an hour or 2 from first dose.  I can imagine this swishing around with pill snot and having it rehydrate to spread out more through your colon.

I'm hoping this makes the pills more effective and I'm once again able to get out and do some work to put food on the table for my kids.  My testing is limited though, but I am sticking with it for now.  God bless !",1362953244.0

For the first 24 hours I was really fucked up. I could only sit up for 10 minutes at a time, it took a ton of effort to even walk to the bathroom, and was mostly in a really heavy sleep. I don't even know if I lost consciousness or stopped breathing at any point. Awful sore throat, nausea, dry mouth, the works.

I went to the ER the next day to get my liver checked out because I knew APAP overdoses can fuck with your liver. Liver was fine, and after 36 hours it had eliminated most of the APAP.

For the next two weeks I had strong waves of nausea come and go, weird headaches, and was generally pretty fuzzy-brained and sluggish. Most of that has cleared up by now, but does anyone know about the long-term physical, psychiatric, and cognitive effects of an overdose like that?

If I don't have something in my system every single day, I go through really bad withdrawals within an hour of waking up.

Well those opiates certainly are a slippery slope, aren't they? After some legit medical problems, I find myself addicted to vicodin/lortab/oxy etc. I have been taking about 5-15mg of Hydrocodone (or equivalent) every day, but only in the evening, and then skipping about 1 day/week.

I'm not sure if I should taper, or cold-turkey. I'm not sure what should be my catalyst for quitting if I do not have any big problems is my life as a result of the addiction, yet.

I know some shit just happened here in the state with the DEA changing the way our fix is tracked. I have a valid script with no ""DNF until...."" data on it.

So my question- are all pharmacies lying upfront due to the fear factor of being robbed? (I'm talking CVS, Walgreens and Wal-Mart all in my local vicinity) Or is there truly a shortage going on?

I'm on insurance, and likely I'll just end up waiting until tomorrow anyway, since my regular pharmacy wrote all over an upper corner of my script (last fill date, and when the next fill can be processed by them).

Educated dope shooters, I'd like your input!","This is a throwaway, because one of my friends was snooping on the 'ole PC and I believe he may have glimpsed my user name. He is of the ""concerned"" variety and has alerted my parents (I'm over 25 and no longer live at home, but live within 30 minutes of parents) over things as minute as doing an no2 balloon (nitrous) on shakedown street after a Phish show (1 balloon, once), so I really don't trust him with sensitive issue. Also, I don't think he really knows how to work this website, but I'm paranoid.  Anywho, I post here all the time, but who is I? 

Anyway, the past coupla days I had to shoot under WAY less than ideal conditions.  One time I was at a friends house, and a non-user friend called and said he would be there in 5 minutes.  I was in the process of emptying the dope into the spoon, so I had literally about 2 minutes to shoot. When I'm in a rush, my body likes to fuck with me, so I NEVER see that gorgeous red plume in time.  The second time, I was in a public restroom, and right after I locked the door, someone is knocking asking if anyone is in there. So, rushed again. (Just FYI, I chip, about a bun a month done over 24 hours, so I like to make 'em count.)

Both times that I was rushed, I went for the vein that hits more often than not-it's to the right of the crook of my left elbow. It's a pretty prominent vein, and when I do hit it right, it makes a satisfying ""pop"" to let me know I'm in like Flynn.

I missed both times today, after getting a small plume of blood on the register attempt, saying ""fuck it,"" and pushing.  Both times I attempted to ""flush,"" (re-register after the shot to ensure successful registration/ make sure all dat dope is in my blood), and was unsuccessful.  Both times I had a slight histamine reaction.

Here is what is odd: I've missed a couple of dozen times in my career.  Every-single-time, it's a singularly disappointing experience, with no rush to speak of, and little to no high.  Now, this is primo dope, but still-the rush is JUST BELOW that of the rush when I hit a vein with this same dope.  Also, I tend not to get as full blown high, but instead, I keep a mild, less noddy high for about 3 hours instead of 1.5.

With shitty dope, I tend to feel like all is lost, and I've gotten nothing from the shot.  What is making this experience different?  Here is what I've narrowed it down to:  

1) This is fantastic dope, and somehow crosses the BBB better.

2) This is a vein I just found 2 buns ago, and it is bigger than most. So, perhaps some seeps into a pierced vein.

3) I know do about 30-40 push ups before my shot, so I am more vascular.  (Does this one even make sense?  I have no idea.)

4) http://images.wikia.com/wikia2011/images/7/75/Aliens.jpg

And the all important number 5)-your explanation. 

Don't get me wrong, I fucking love gettin high when I think I'm not gonna get there...but I just..don't...get it.

Ideas?  Thanks!

Since my last question, I finally have my OLD doctor from when I was a kid helping me out (luckily it was JUST under 7 years since I've seen him, so I was still his patient). He prescribed me 75 narco 5/325 to hold me over until I see a new pain management doctor that he is referring me to. I'm happy to at *least* be on the bottom rung of the RIGHT ladder ;) but anywho, I had recently kicked a pretty decent oxy habit and has been over a month since I've used, and over a week off of suboxone. 


For some reason, the hyrdocodone does next to nothing now, even if I take 50-60mg at once (I'm not doing that daily. I know APAP blah,blah) 

Is the ineffectiveness a result of having abused heavier substances or is it a lingering tolerance from years ago? I figured with being off the subs for a week it would have put me back to square one, but 60mg barely takes the pain away now. Any thoughts?

I'm actually doing some research on opiates (mostly heroin, turns out shit's complicated) for a thing I'm writing, and I was hoping people here would want to help me out and share some stories. So yeh, a few questions for you:

What got you started on opiates? Was there a moment where you said to yourself ""Hey, this seems like a thing I want to do."", or did it just kinda happen?

Is the world of opiates as bad as it looks in movies? I hear stories of dealers forcing people to smoke so they get addicted, or users losing everything, and even on the front page of the sub I see a dude who's scared his dealer's going to kill him. Is that normal, or is that stuff mostly exaggeration?

Is it worth it? From an outsider's perspective, a lot of the business of getting  high seems terribly unpleasant, and I have a hard time understanding how it could be enjoyable. Explain?

Do you have any cool stories you'd like to share? I'm particularly interested in things I can change the names and locations of and reuse in my writing, with permission of course, but I'd also just like to hear some anecdotes from you guys about your experiences.

Would you quit? Could you? Do you think you should? I'm not judging; I'm boring, but you guys can do whatever you like. I'm just curious what the general opinion is among opiate users regarding addiction and dependency.

So yeh. Those are the questions that popped into my head, but if there's anything else you think I'd be interested in or should know in order to write about opiate use, pitch in! I dunno the etiquette of this sub or if it's cool for me to pop in asking questions like that, so feel free to let me know if it's not kosher.

","So, ya know that pretty fat vein that runs from where your wrist is below your pinkie down to your elbow?  I personally can feel it without a belt on, and if I do throw a belt on, it plumps up fat.

Whenever I help my friends hit, I'm able to get it to register and hit immediately, on the first try 9times out of 10.  Then, I'd try it on myself, and I'd be lucky to register one time out of 10.

I realized why tonight-when I was helping people, the needle on the syringe was facing down, towards the crook of the elbow.  When I did it on my self, the needle was facing up, towards the hand.  Of course, when you're shooting towards the elbow, you're also shooting towards the heart, which is the direction blood flows in the vein, so it's much easier to hit.  When you try to hit a vein facing AWAY from the heart, I find it is often much more difficult to successfully register.


TL;DR: Having trouble finding a vein? Look at your palm. Put your index finger on your pinkie nail. Now go down to the bone that sticks out on the left side of your wrist. From there, move down a bit and (on my arm, anyway) towards the inside of your arm-and you should feel a juicy vein. A belt helps. Insert needle TOWARDS the crook of elbow-it's tricky and it feels backwards-but you SHOULD hit.

1aidh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1aidh8/not_exactly_hittingbut_getting_a_decent_rushhigh/,8,https://redd.it/1aidh8,dope_AWAY_account,Not exactly hitting-but getting a decent rush/high?,"I already asked almost the same question, but I was wayy too long winded and asked at 5:30am EST, so I don't think anyone saw it.

I have this one vein (left arm, crook of elbow, toward inside of arm-in line with the pinkie) that was hitting REALLY well for quite a while. It was hard to go anywhere else, because usually it takes me 5-7 pricks before I hit, and this guy was hitting WELL immediately EVERY TIME.

Now, it's not hitting anymore.  However, when I pull the needle out, a decent size drop of blood usually follows. A few times I've been rushed, and I just went ahead and shot there.  I end up with about 1/2 as intense as usual of a rush, I get a pretty solid high, about 3/4 as strong as usual, and it lasts a longish time-usually about 4 hours as opposed to 3 if I hit correctly.

However, I also get a bit of a histaime reaction, and it will usually swell up a bit around the injection site-and then go back down to normal within about 30 minutes.

Two questions-is it dangerous? Sometimes it gets a bit swollen, but it hasn't yet lasted more than 30 minutes.  That said, if I'm beggin for an abscess here, it's NOT worth it, and I'll stop.

2nd-why am I getting high? I thought maybe I was kind of piercing the vein, but it's a bit too thin to get in and register-so when I shoot, the dope MOSTLY goes into my blood stream, but some goes into the muscle around? I figure that because that would explain why I get a bit of a bump like I do when I miss entirely, but I still get a bit of a rush and nice and high, which never happens when I miss entirely.

I know it is relative from person to person, and maybe people on here can just say what was normal for them, but I am curious how much a ""functional addict"" consumes of their drug of choice.  

Since this is r/opiates, I am specifically speaking of opiates, but it also applies to any other substance that can be abused, alcohol, marijuana, speed, coke, etc..  

Maybe your not using right now but used to be a regular user, or maybe you are a mess, no matter what you currently are Im currious what you have to say.  Thanks to anyone who shares",1363584147.0

I have been going to this dude on and off for 2 years now. Not once have I ever had a problem. I went down Thursday/friday/and got burnt saturday.

Every time I went to meet him this weekend he was at this bar/club near his house so Im thinking he dropped mad bread, fucked his money up, and needed my 70 to re up. The only reason I'm worrying about my safety is because I know that this individual person is violent, and has more than likely taken human life in the past. I was jumped last year and got banged up pretty bad. I went down the next day to cop and he asked me what happened. After I told him, he said, ""well if you need help with that, lemme know, thats what I do"". As he was saying that (lol), he shows me a gun he has in his coat and kind of playfully taps it on my car wit a smile on his face. 

Idkk. Again, he has no reason to hurt me but I tried going down earlier today (broad daylight), and he told me he was broken down out of state and couldn't meet up. HE just texted me again saying to come thru (its nightime now) and I obviously want to get my moneys worth. Any help is greatly appreciated. S

The big pharms have come out with a generic form because many insurances won't pay for the strips of suboxone. 

The pill is white, round, and has 155 on one side, and a quarter moon on the other. It tastes like absolute shit, and makes your mouth smell like grandma's asshole before the biweekly shower at the old folks home. **Brush your teeth 20 minutes after you take it**

Now, I wanted to announce this because many of you, myself included for a long while, bought your suboxone on the street due to no insurance. I wanted to warn you all- it is coming. Most users are on state insurance, because they are trying to get their lives back in order. Big insurance companies want to pay for the cheapest drug, so they go with the generic pill. **So please, don't think your dealer is pulling a fast one on you.** 

All in all- it works just fine. I never thought anything would taste worse then that tangy orange, but here it is. It's much worse. But, it makes you feel better. I'm less constipated, too. I don't know if it is my uptake in fruits, or the change in medication, but I'm poopin' like a champ!

i come from a long line of cannabis based extractions and tried to do a isopropyl alcohol wash on roughly 1/2 a lb of seeds for him hoping it would work similar to a QWISO tek.

after starting this shin-dig i realized that the alkaloids in the seeds aren't very soluble in iso, unless heated. so heat was added and the seed wash and the result was a nice golden yellow color (looked like semi cloudy piss) that's evaporating as we speak.

however last night we did a small preliminary run of some of the filtered material to see what the effects were. to my surprise after fan drying 75% and hot water bathing the rest of the way, the reddish brown goo at the end would not solidify, it stays as a viscous liquid (even in the freezer for 30 min) the taste and smell isn't great but not bad either(all iso evaporated, there was no odor to the seeds at this point)the goo has a slightly toasted coconut taste at the end (tastes a lot like ground up seeds smells, like that nutty floral smell) 

The product did provide some tingly sensations brought on by the initial rush of opiates and effects were felt. but the black residue on my [nail](http://cdn103.iofferphoto.com/img3/item/513/406/900/14-4mm-bho-concentrate-dome-set-angled-ti-nail-52-1ca3.JPG)(another cannabis technique of a dome and titanium nail for vaporizing oils and extracts) was not satisfactory. this led me to believe we had a dirty product. and that's where you guys come in i need some tips on further purifying.

well to the question (sorry for the wall of text) i want to know if washing the goo in warm water(which seems to be a much better solvent for the desired alkolides) give better results or make a better smokable ""opium""?

just want some results if anyone else has ever iso washed the seeds and what their results were like.

thanks for the read and thanks for any potential tips and help =)

another idea is to just scape all the goo into gel caps and ingesting that way if it cant be cleaned up",1363633821.0

I know that the doctor said absolutely know alcohol for the first few weeks, but are oxys ok to take?  I mean realistically I'm going to take them either way, but just wanted to know if I am doing myself harm or if they are ok to take.  

And if anyone cares heres the story.

Last wednesday - friday I headed up to vermont to go skiing with three other people.  The first run of the trip on thursday morning I am making my way down the trail about 2/3rds down.  Out of the 3 people I was with I passed the guy out in front and I was infront of everyone probably easily going 25 - 30 MPH.  The next thing I remember is opening my eyes and seeing a blanket over my head and a guy named chris introducing himself and telling me that I had a bad fall and that I might feel confused.  Then I kind of fell back to sleep and the next thing I remember after that is waking up in the ambulance which I found out was almost an hour from when I had taken the fall.  

So In total I was unconscious for about 10 mins on the mountain.  But it took almost an hour for me to really come back and regain full conciousness or at least thats what it felt like.  Then once I got to the hospital everyone was naked and drinking it was awesome.  Wait actually no that never happened.  They just made me pee in a cup and then read out loud infront of my father what drugs were in my system which was super embarrassing. 

Hope everyone elses week has been a littel bit bettor then mine.

I started Depakote yesterday (250mg/day, tapering up to 1000mg in a month) and would like to know if I should expect this to interfere, interact, or otherwise affect my recreational opiate use. I have a little dope left. Is it safe to take it now that I'm on Depakote? 

I'm also interested in/concerned by the possibility that in a month I'll be given Naltrexone. Doc said it's important that I haven't ""taken any narcotics for one months prior"" to taking Naltrexone. I put out some gentle feelers, ""Well, I did make some poppy seed tea for a headache. Should that be a problem? (Technically not a lie). ""Nah."" He said. ""Too weak to count."" He's clearly never tried my tea. 

The truth is that I've been doing a bit of dope here and there, not habitually. And I use strong tea a couple times a week for pain. It's the only tool I've got. Drug reference sites are telling me that the body only needs a week or 2 to clear opiates before taking Naltrexone (wiki says 7-10 days), but I do *not* feel like experiencing rapid detox.

He is literally a genius (photographic memory, like a rain-man), but he has ZERO social skills. He is autistic.  
If you told him your father was a martian, he would probably believe you.  He never lies, and sees no reason to lie.  For example, I play tennis with him, and I was his partner once.  I mentioned that the court smelled kind of funny, and he says ""I had a large bowel movement before coming out to play.  It's probably the fecal matter around my anus. I'll shower after.""  He said this all with a straight face.  THAT is why I think I might be able to get away with this.  I wouldn't try this on a normal doc.



So, after about a year give or take of shooting, I have my first abscess. It's on the inside of my left elbow.  I am getting it drained tomorrow.

I'm going to have my dermatologist drain it.  He's been my derma since I was 5, and is a super cool guy.  He's super nerdy but not very smart-an oblivious genius.  He is also very easy with the pen-I often would ask for, and get, percocet 10/325's for things like getting moles removed, which isn't that painful.

So, anyway, my tracks heal VERY quickly, and I don't have many.  There aren't many puncture wounds around the abscess-it's pretty smooth, just very red and irritated.

I plan on telling him that my friend has a new kitten who does not know the strength of his own claws, and he has been scratching the shit out of me lately.  One of those scratches just happened to turn into an abscess.  

Up to that point, I'm confident all will go well. (For those thinking ""just be honest and tell him it's from shooting up-it's just too awkward.  This guy has known my family for decades, I play tennis with him twice a week, and he's just super dweeby-not very easy to talk to.)  

If it's very painful, both during and afterwards, I was thinking of saying that ""I don't get much relief from the 'codones-both hyrocodone (vicodin) and oxycodone (percocet).  And morphine, of course, makes me too itchy.  But what really seems to hit the spot is this thing my docs given me a few times-what's it called-Panda? Opiano? Oh, wait, that's it-opana!  Yea, he usually gives me these pink tabs with a 10 on them. (Opana IR 10mg)  IF he says ""well, I usually prescribe something similar to that, but they're extended release"" I'll be ready with ""oh, the long lasting ones?  Yea, I got those once-I couldn't shit for a week!  Definitely not those!""

Either that, or Demerol, but my veins are kinda fucked anyway, and opana's are made for snorting, so I think I'd just LOVE some opana IR10mg.  Even just 5 or 10.  I've never tried em, and god would I love to.

Is this a total pipe dream?  The biggest risk is that once I say I don't react well to hydro or oxycodone, he could just write those off, and just tell me to take aleve.  Now, I'd much rather have percocet's then nothing.

So, how would you approach this?  If this makes you morally squeamish, than just pretend it's a hypothetical situation.

Childhood friend has gotten to THAT level,"For confidentiality I'll call him ""Joe"". At first I will write a background, but if you don't wish to read just skip to the ""Currently"" or ""My Question"" section.

Background:
Joe and I had our first experience with 30mg roxys (oxycodone HCL) in the summer of 2011, as well as our first time insufflating anything. As always, we would split 30mgs and feel just fine. From summer 2011 to spring/summer 2012 we had both started to use the substance more often. I consider myself a responsible drug user and know my limits, Joe on the other hand does not have the self-control that I have. From that first experience in summer 2011 until the present, I do on average about 4-6 30mgs per month, sometimes more, sometimes less. Joe developed a much bigger habit than myself. As always with addicts it always became more frequent with higher doses. During summer 2012 Joe had devloped a habbit of about 10-20 30mg roxys DAILY. That same summer we also had our first experience with H. I've done it a handful of times since, and Joe is getting closer and closer to rock bottom.

Currently:
In the past 4-6 months or so Joe had completely switched from roxys to H. For the first few months it was just insufflation, now he has switched to injecting. He seems to get worse every time I see him. He sold so many of his things including a very expensive TV to afford his habit. The worst part is that he very obviously shoots up, but when I ask him about it he blatantly lies about it. For example: multiple times a night he claims to ""have to take a shit"", and everyone knows that when you've been opiates that's the last thing you're going to do. Anyways, one night he stood up and said he was going to take a shit, he then put on a belt (wasn't wearing one before) as well as a very large winter jacket, which I assume contained his paraphernalia. No need for further examples, just know there have been many occasions like this one.  

My Question:
How do I help him to stop using? or at least stop shooting up and using so much so frequently. I'm sure some of you out there have either been Joe in my story, or know a Joe yourself. PLEASE give me any advice you have!!

I love Joe, I've known him my whole life, and I don't want his death to come anytime soon, from anything that involves his habit. Please, give tips, advice, anything that can help slow down this habit of his.

It was pretty painful, but I made it.  He didn't question my cat scratch story at all, he even said that's fairly common for people very allergic to cats. (Which I am.)  I decided not to bring up pain meds at all;  he said to take double dose ibuprofen, and if it's still painful, to call him and he'd call in a painkiller.  To those who wished me luck and were kind, thank you. For those who were rude and unhelpful: suck my puss. 

Edit: I DO already have an appointment with a VERY COMPETENT (though autistic) dermatologist tomorrow at 7:40am. That is 5 hours 40 min away. Please don't say ""go to a clinic""-I thought through that part. Does anyone have any advice on what I should between then and now?  It is very painful to the touch and an ANGRY red color.  Should I clean it myself at ALL or just wait for the doc? do I wanna do anything?

So, I made the post yesterday about maybe getting Opana for getting an abscess drained.  It was pretty much a joke-meaning unless for some reason I was feeling incredibly ballsy, I wasn't going to ask.

I feel the opposite.  I thought the appointment was going to be this morning. They can't do it until TOMORROW morning. Last night I barely felt it...now, it fucking KILLS.  This experience has turned me off IV completely.  I threw out all my spoons, my rigs, and I really am going to try to stop. Fuck this shit.

Anyway, the receptionist swore up and down that I definitely would be OK going one more day, and I mostly believe her.  The problem is, it's getting continually more painful.  It's too the point that I have to hold my arm a certain way for it not to hurt..and if I touch it, forget about it.

Is there anything I can do to improve the condition of it?  Should I clean it? With what? How often? I have on a clean shirt-should I not have one on?  Should I ice it?  Should I use a heat-pad?

I found plenty of info of what to do for an abscess AFTER it's drained, but I can't seem to find any info on what to do while you wait for the appointment.

I'm making plans to finish tapering and head off to another state for a week or two to finish the detox, but in the mean time, I've been chipping. 

Before I started using a little more 8 weeks ago, I was down to .25 mg every 16 hours. Now on the days I don't use I require more like .6 mg/day. Not a lot, but a significant amount more than .25 every 16 hours, which didn't block dope for me at all. I mean I'm sure any Bupe at all could block codeine and maybe hydros, but I'm talking shootin dope, ds, and maybe a roxi or two if I get desperate.

Question is, do you think there's any significant blocking at .6/day? .8? 1 mg? Where does the blocking effect seem to come in?

I just don't really understand why anyone would need 8 mg/day unless the goal was to completely block yourself from getting high. I can shoot half to a whole bundle a day for the better part of a week and only need to go .2-3/day higher than where I was at in the taper process for a few days and then go back down without much issue.

I know chipping on Bupe is a slippery slope, but I'm excited to shoot some h after my Bupe doc piss test tmrw (which I only agree too bc he writes me klonopin).",1363926820.0

My friend back in Texas picked up .75 grams of heroin, drove to a grocery store parking lot to shoot it before driving home. He also had 1/8th of weed with him. Apparently mid-prep a cop walked up and knocked on the window and told him to get out of the car. They took him to holding cell for a couple days until his parents bailed him. 

Now, before anyone goes on about how stupid he is for not waiting until he gets home, you're are preaching to the choir, please refrain from those comments.

He is ~20 years old with no prior record for ANYTHING. And as of 3 months ago he has been seeing an addiction therapist every week and is prescribed to subs. 

After a little research I found that the charge for less than a gram in Texas is 180 days to 2 years in jail and up to $10,000 fine. 


**So my question is:** is he really going to get 180 days? 
From your experience or the experience of those around you are there any exceptions to these rules? 
Will he get a lighter sentence because it is his first offense? 
And have you ever heard of anyone being given the opportunity to go to rehab instead of jail?
Any other information or personal experience would be greatly appreciated.

For some people it's pretty severe and your whole body spasms.. kind of like that experience of being asleep and suddenly jerking awake,like from a falling dream. For me, it's much more subtle and usually only happens when I've I.V.'d H or Hydr0 and it doesn't necessarily need to be a large dose or full nod.  


  
Unfortunately, science doesn't know all that much about preventing/treating which likely relates to the [pathophysiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myoclonus#Pathophysiology) being varied or in some cases, unknown.  
  
For me, it manifests as more of an internal zap feeling than a physical twitch. It happens all throughout my body, like for a second on my right bicep/chest area, then later on my left. It can happen in my legs too here and there tho is mostly localized to my chest. I used to think it was my *Heart* which really freaked me out because it almost feels like it's skipping a beat or is too large for the chest cavity for a second or something. **Surely some of you must experience this too**, as there are a handful of forums on the web where people discuss it.  
 
  
Anyway, it looks like it can be more common in people who have done a lot of recreational drugs (and/or antidepressants), specifically benzos, opiates, and perhaps E (as they specify serotonin): *Some researchers speculate that abnormalities or deficiencies in the receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors that appear to be related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for opiates, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter that is important for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord. More research is needed to determine how these receptor abnormalities cause or contribute to myoclonus.*  
  
From what I've found online, some fellow nodders claim to have had success decreasing their frequency or making them stop altogether. I WOULD LOVE THIS because it's really annoying and it continues to freak me out a little bit even though it seems to be a fairly benign condition *if only happening when high on opiates*. There are a handful of scary diseases it can be linked to if it's happening a lot in the day to day sober life, like  multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and even Serotonin Syndrome.. So it seems most wise for anyone in the non-nod sober twitch camp to talk to their PCP or a neurologist about it, assuming they care about living for a long time. 

**THE TREATMENTS** that some claim work are calcium supplements, RLS herbal supplements or OTC varieties, piracetam, 5HTP, Clonazepam (risky choice while on a nod!), [dantrolene](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514554), and simply hydration.  
  
If any of you also experience these types of zaps and are in the midst of a daily regimen, perhaps we can experiment and post some results here? I'm going to buy some calcium tomorrow and also start a piracetam regimen again. I'll also throw some Phenibut in the mix but I'll keep that dose low since it's a benzo. And perhaps some L-Theanine since they potentiate each other well.

Right now my habit is about 5-10 bags a day (sniffed), each bag being roughly equivalent to 15mg of oxy.

I'm doing my last 1.5 bags this morning, but after that likely won't be getting any more for a little while.

After that, I've got ~5lb of poppy seeds, and can get plenty of loperamide.

Do you guys think this progression will help to lessen the withdrawals? Or will this not really do much, and I should just bite the bullet and jump from heroin to lope to nothing? (skipping the PST, as I feel that may just be prolonging the inevitable)

anyway, any input would be appreciated.. I've only had to quit after a long daily habit once before so I don't have a lot of experience with it..

(I am parked where the alley forms a t with another alley) He just says ""run"" so I hand the bun off to my friend who hides it in her nether regions, throw my truck into 4 x 4 and first gear. I mount the curb and we gun it down the alley and onto a main road where units are coming upto block that alley. they do not see us. I swerve off into another alley and run three blocks before hooking a left and getting onto the highway and across a bridge back into new jersey. 

later I found out the city has an under cover truck that is the same year make model color and version as mine which we are assuming is why all the marked cars we passed did nor light us up.",1364187191.0

So, I've been hanging and hitting the xanax all morning, till I acquiesce and get a homebake rig with 100 units in it, now, i'm used to a 100mg:100 unit ratio, and this shit I receive looks well prepared, so I'm full of beans knowing my sickness will be long gone. I get to driving, seeing as though I have a time constraint on my dope run. Now I think I'm super man or some shit, cause I am driving with my knees, mate in passenger seat, middle man in back, using my right hand to hit in my left arm.

I soon pull up to a traffic lights, feeling wicked, and check the clock.

Next thing I know I'm looking at the same clock, 3 mins later, cars beeping to fuck behind me with a massive line of backed up traffic, both my passengers passed the fuck out, and with a squad car doing the slowest possible drive by beside me.

Needless to say, woke me up pretty quick, almost stalled getting around the corner as the traffic lights turn.

Would later find out it was a 400mg:100 unit ratio that was for the dope lady herself, lucky me.

So I've been a user for a long time (every opiate in the book; from kratom, darvocet, and tramadol, to hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and other powerful opioids), a true addict for about 2 years (primarily heroin and oxycodone, switiching to suboxone on and off), and an IVer for about a month (using ECP only). 

So, my question is this:

When I started out shooting I used the crooks of my elbows, as so many of us do. In an attempt to diversify and save my best veins (one of which already has a hard lump, which I'm nervous about, but that's another story), I've been moving slowly up my arms. I've had great success with the long veins on the tops of my arms (the ones that run roughly from the thumb-end of your wrist to your inner elbow) and everything has seemed fine, save for some bruising that I don't think is out of the oridinary (and the lump)... Until today. 

My use has escalated slowly from 1 bag to 2 bags per day on average. These are small bags (the good ones I'd guess 45-50mg, the shitty ones more like 30mg) and because of the quality (which is lacking) it boils down to 1 shot per bag. The powder is very white without rocks and dissolves into a very clear, slightly yellowish solution. This is the only heroin I've ever shot so I don't have anything to compare it to, but my impression is that it isn't very good. The rush feels good, but is very short-lived and I've yet to have the kind of experience you read about people having when they shoot up. Like... The way they illustrate it in something like Trainspotting where people lay back moaning, their eyes rolling back? No. It feels good, but I usually stay sitting up, enjoy the feeling for a moment, and go about my business. The moderate euphoria of the rush quickly gives way to sedation which stays with me for several hours and keeps me well for about 10-12. I hope to find better shit soon, but regardless, that's how I'd describe this stuff. If anyone is curious, it's a stamp that says HOPE and has hands clasped together in prayer.

So I'm taking my first shot of the day, set it up, register in the vein about 6 inches up my arm from the wrist of my right arm, on the top (the one that's a straight-shot back from your thumb), and press the plunger down. I feel my dopesickness begin to alleviate, but what overpowers any kind of rush I might be feeling is the rapidly intensifying itching/burning growing in my arm, traveling all the way up the back of my hand, a good 5-7 inches from the injection site in both directions. My mind rapidly goes to horror stories about hitting arteries, but I can't understand how that would be the case. This vein isn't the most distinctly blue, but I'm quite sure it isn't red and it definitely swells and pops to the surface when I rope it off as a surface vein should. Anyway, my arm gets severely itchy and red, but sort of numb to the touch and I'm getting worried. I rush to the bathroom and get a hot towel compress onto it in case it's some kind of bizarre miss (even though I registered and don't think it fell out). Anyway, it generally subsides within 10-15 minutes. When I feel better I finish off that bag and do a tiny bit of another into the crook of my left elbow, which goes perfectly fine.

So then this late afternoon I do my second bag of the day. Like the first, I do it into my right arm, but a different vein that is very obviously blue and that I have used before without incident. Once again, my arm (this time not my hand at all, and less severely) goes red, itchy, burns, and is mildly numb to the touch. Neither time did I get the soft under-the-skin swollen lump that I've gotten the few times I've missed. My arm feels back to normal at this point, but it makes me nervous to have my body react that way.

Does anyone have any idea what happened, whether I should be worried, advice, etc? Should I stop using my right arm? I have been trying to use it more because of the lump in my left, but I'm new enough at this that I defer to the advice of my elders. 

Thanks for input.",1364165108.0

I've wanted to try opiates for a bit. I ~~understand~~ the risks involved (this is a bit of a lie, you can never really understand) but I've successfully navigated an unlimited supply of amphetamines and klonopin without addiction, and I'm in a place where a potential addiction wouldn't go very far, (parents know about my interest in experiment with drugs though certainly not opiates, and would likely notice). Anyway, that my rational. I want to try something that won't let me down, but also won't have me puking and itching my balls off. I'm trying it to decide whether to add opiates my drug cycle and I don't want to feel like I haven't had all there is to offer (short of IV dillly/H). If opiates are just to good, I'll know not to go back again. Anyways, I'm an 18 year old guy looking for recommendation for a first timer. The SR will be my route, so really anything is an option. Thanks. Any advice is appreciated, but to save you the trouble, I have seen the typical warnings, so unless you have something especially pertinent or relevant to add, I have likely already taken it it. 

The one question I have is where anyone would suggest going with a milder opiate so that if it's something I feel like I would really like I'll know not to try it again. Here I'm wondering if tying something like Hydrocone vs. Oxy would effect addiction potential. Thanks!

I've been smoking a bit of some of my bags of ECP, but its hard to say if the way I do it is really effective because I usually only smoke a small amount after snorting some and I'm already high. I sniff most of the bag, then set aside a little bit on some foil. I try to do my best to hold the lighter as far away from the foil but still get the heroin to vaporize. Generally the powder melts to a brown-ish liquid or tar like substance before bubbling up and vaporizing.. I've read of people mixing small amount of water with powder to do this, or other things to make freebasing more effective...

As a frequent user of IRC and with much disappointment of the regular IRC room, I decided to fix up a room that is to be used.  The previous room had a founder that is nowhere to be found, thus no ops in the room, no traffic, and such.

The new official channel is #r.opiates on the server irc.freenode.net ; All rules of /r/opiates will also be present on the IRC.  If you think ""why don't we just use the tinychat?"" We can use both.  Sometimes it's annoying to cam up when people are just open mic spamming their music at a quality worse than tape mixes off the radio recorded in a place with bad reception.  There is a link to the tinychat in the channel topic of #r.opiates.  The room is currently mostly empty, however feel free to lurk and to also push this IRC room to become more popular.  It's always nice to have a place where you can bullshit about random shit with people who share the same hobbies as you.  Also depending on popularity, I may have to set up a few ops and half-ops, but we'll see how the traffic goes.  Can't wait to see you guys in IRC.

Couldn't they just make the drug in a Gummy form...like Gummy vitamins?

That would prevent people from crushing and sniffing them...

Im sure extracting the drug from the Gummy would be a bit harder as their would be a lot of sugar/gluclose(spelling) to remove, but smashing/chopping it up small enough to do an extraction would be kinda hard, and even harder if you put some kind of *coating over it or make most of the Gummy pill extremely dissolveable in water / alcohol just like the drug so if you are able to do some type of extraction you also have a butt load of sugar and what not in.the end result?

*And by ""coating"" i mean some coating that is not porous / won't allow liquid to be absorbed into. Or the complete opposite, something extremely soluble in water that would ""pollute"" any methods of extracting in water render it un IV'able.

Im sure some method of extraction requiring some chemistry could be achieved but if the extraction takes longer Than 30 mins than most people will just not do it....


Im not hoping this is done but wouldn't this be a wise move for them?

The only statistic i was able to find on the subject was an old forum post on bluelight stating that a needle prick leaves you with about a 3% of contracting. The information from that post leaves me to believe that while washing the rig out with tap water definitley does not kill or remove the virus it does decrease the chance drastically as opposed to if I had drawn a shot directly after him.

Does this sound like it could put me into withdrawals again? I'm not too worried about chipping since I can put myself through withdrawals without buying more H. Avoiding opiates while in withdrawals is by far the hardest aspect of addiction IMO.

Makes me think that maybe that one bag got wet, and when it dried some of the powder stuck together and shit, or something... both powders taste pretty similar (very bitter), although I guess the darker one seems to taste a little different in an indescribable way...

I have 45 7.5mg/500mg Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen left over from an ACL repair that I had last year. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm fully aware that these are not strong, but for someone with zero opiate tolerance, they get the job done.

I have to stop doing all drugs soon, so I decided that I would try taking a few of these. I'm aware of the dangers of Acetaminophen, and I wasn't sure of the correct dosage of Hydrocodone to get the desired effect either, so I did a little research, and decided based upon that research that three 7.5/500's would be a good starting dose, and I wouldn't even need to perform a CWE.

Well, to make a long story short, I took 3 of the pills, and waited for the effects to begin. After about 30 minutes, the pills started to take their effect. I began to feel content with everything, while doing absolutely nothing. I felt drowsy, and felt like if I needed to, I could still go about my day. The itching was probably the worst, because when I was on the brink of consciousness about to fall asleep, I would itch, and it would bring me back to consciousness. I laid with my eyes closed just feeling happy, and alone with my thoughts for about 30-45 minutes, after which I fell asleep.

Waking up two hours later, I felt nauseous. I'm not sure if this is an effect commonly experienced with opiates, but it remained around for a couple more hours, and it was extremely unpleasant. Overall, though, I'm pretty pleased with my experience. Can't say that I'll be trying any more opiates, simply for fear of becoming addicted to them (I have an addictive personality), but it was pleasant, and I can see how so many of you can have a dependence on them, especially the harder opiates. 

Well, sorry for the long rant, but this was just a story about my first real experience with recreational opiate use. Feel free to comment, and I'll try to reply to all of them.

I was with a couple of friends, dropping one friend off in the Bronx.  We stopped at a 7-11, and there were some very obvious under cover cops in there.  They looked like they could be extras on Law and Order or something-gelled hair, muscles, tight tees, necklace badges under tight tees.

I was carrying a bit of dope on me at the time, and so was a passenger.  They left before us, and I put my dope/works in glove box and MADE my passenger do the same-then locked said box.  I get out of the parking lot, make one turn, and the cop is sitting there, and he immediately lights me up. 

Within seconds, 4 cops are surrounding my car.  They get us all out of the car and ask how we know each other.  I said I met the girl recently on match.com and that we had a few dates that went well, so I was introducing her to my friends.  Hence why the three of us were together.  They actually seemed to buy that.  They searched all of us and searched my car, and found nothing.

HERE is where it gets crazy-they asked for my keys. ""Why,"" I pondered. ""To look in your glovebox, dude."" ""Sorry, sir..I don't consent to you searching my glovebox, and it is locked.""

One of the cops said something like ""Supreme court case, bud, look it up...we can bust your glove box or you can give us the keys,""..so I (stupidly?) gave him the keys.  He hands it to a partner, who goes in my car, opens the glovebox, and closes it 30 seconds later, saying only ""Nope."" They then apologize for stopping us and let us go.  

When I got to my destination, I opened the glove box-the 3 needles and 15 bags of dope were sitting there, plain as day.  No way did he miss that.  Were they just a gang unit, looking for guns? Did they break the law with the search and were only looking for big scores?
ANY explanation would be nice...I'm so fucking confused.

What really sells it though is the BIOAV when you sniff it. Something like 80%+. And it only takes a few mgs to really kick off a fantastic nod, way lower than heroin or oxycodone. This is the only opiate that really ever gets me off and I have some freakishly weird opiate tolerance, no matter how long it's been since I've done them and even the first times. Heroin is nice and all but unless you are lucky you don't get good enough heroin to sniff and the needle is not worth all the bad energy it brings with it, at least IMHO.

Oxymorphone is the only opiate I know that can bring on a killer nod quick and off a few mgs, yet without being overly dangerous. The euphoria is short-lived and tolerance builds quickly, making this a drug for the weekend user only. Also, and maybe most importantly, it's the only one that can do this safely through snorting, anything similar requires extreme danger (smoking fentanyl) or requires a needle, which is a route I don't think many recommend to anyone as it is a very rare individual that can safely and responsibly use drugs IVing.

I was a big fan and got started when they were the old formula. Was gone far away from any opiates (except dirty H I wasn't going to put into my body) and when I came back they were dirt cheap but switched to a new formula. Luckily, thanks to oxymorphone's mega-high nasal bioavalability it is fairly easy to grind the new formula to a fine powder and then mix 1:1 with something like b12 tablets. If done in a dry nose, small bumps at a time will pass through your sinus cavities just like the old formulas. The key is a dry nose, small bumps, and time in between to keep as much as possible from sliming up and dropping in your stomach (the BIOAV of oxymorphone in your stomach is 10%, which is like a complete waste).

What are your opinions on this? Is there some wonder drug I am missing? Is there some point I am just not getting? I'd love to hear the /r/opiates communities opinion on this.",1364570716.0

Last time something like this happened was after I'd been doing opana and heroin daily for awhile.. I did my last dose of opana, and 5 minutes later, was puking, then spent the whole day puking my guts out, even went to the hospital it was so bad that time. I figured I had just destroyed the opana in prepping my nasal shot (new opana, needs to be cooked and shit) so my last dose actually didn't really get any opana into me, so I started w/ding, and that's why I puked.

So, that was a pretty miserable experience, and I figured that must just be how bad w/d's are... but yesterday, I had pretty much the exact same thing happen, except I was using.. I had gone monday only doing 1.5bags of H in the morning, then only PST on the rest of monday (2lb throughout monday), then 2lb throughout tuesday, then wednesday 1lb, and I got some H that night.

I was using the H, got high, felt good, but started feeling nauseous as I was getting in bed. It was pretty easy to ignore though, and I just figured I had eaten something weird (I had the munchies and was eating a bunch of junk food and shit right before going to bed). Woke up in the middle of the night and puked, still thinking it was just something weird going on in my stomach, but woke up the next morning feeling horrible. I thought it was definitely dope sickness, as I felt pretty identical to the day of puking after opana, I puked, then did a line, started feeling high and a little better, but soon the nausea came back, and I was just high and nauseous, and eventually puking..

I felt dopesick and high at the same time.. and it definitely wasn't like ""oh shit, I did too much, I gotta puke""- I know what that feels like, and it isn't particularly miserable, and once you get it over with, you feel better... I felt sick alllllll day, nothing I could do. I tried several different anti-nausea medicines, and continued using heroin, but stopped at some point because despite being high, I still felt like shit.


I dunno if I was just sick with something entirely different both times, or what the fuck was going on, but it felt exactly the same, and definitely feels like its related to opiate use... I really don't know what the fuck it is. The only thing that seemed to help was smoking weed, and even that didn't help some of the time.


I woke up this morning feeling pretty shitty, and was apprehensive to use heroin, but I did, and I'm starting to feel better... I kept down the last meal I ate last night, and haven't puked since then, so I'm hoping I'm over this..",1364561399.0

Also, ITT-what happens when you need to have an abscess drained, without much gore.","I'm gonna put the TL; DR in front, because I'm nodding and this post came out to be 15x longer than it needs to be: Can I shoot either above or below the site of an almost healed abscess, as that is by far my juiciest, most cooperative vein?  I'm assuming I can NOT shoot in the abscess affected area/vein, even if I am 12 inches above or below the site. Feel free to read on, or you can stop here-thanks.
Just FYI..I go into detail about the process of draining an abscess, so if your squeamish, stop now...but if you're interested in what goes on, do read on.

So, I've always had trouble shooting, from the beginning. Even as a teenager with 5% bodyfat, a six pack, swimming 10k yards a day and lifting 3-4x a week, I've never been vascular. Nurses have always had to poke around to draw blood or insert an IV.

Due to this, it usually takes me a good 5-20pokes (I stop and open a fresh rig after 10 unsuccessful pokes, and will completely stop, chug some water, and do another 30-50 push ups after 20 non-registers.)
About 3 weeks ago, I found my money vein. Left arm, inner elbow and down to the wrist. The vein was just popping out..I have no idea how I missed it for so long. It literally registered the first 15 times I tried it...so, it became tempting to go there EVERY time.  It also is a MUCH less sensitive spot for me than right in the crook of my elbow...I LOATHE shooting there. Fucking kills, and I never register.

Anyway, because of the temptation to go where I hit ""every time,"" I began to get lazy and I would just go up and down my left arm, hitting different spots of the same vein.  I rationalized it by saying ""well, I'm not hitting the same SPOT twice, am I?""....but we all know that's bullshit.  I was hitting the same fucking vein over and over.

And sure enough...I got an abscess.  I missed one night, and saw it swell up in size IMMEDIATELY...""better keep an eye on that,"" I thought.  Two days pass, and it's now VERY sore, and has actually gotten a bit bigger.  The next day, it begins to turn red, and is BURNING hot to the touch and super sore.  So, I bite the bullet and call my dermatologist. (Remember the post where I postulated asking for Opana from my derm. and maybe getting them, and then we all played the fun game where I opened wide and everyone shat down my throat?)  I make an appointment for the next morning, and I barely fucking made it..shit fucking HURT by the time I made it to his office at 7am, it woke me up all night long.  I seriously considered going to the ER but was just having requiem for a dream style visions of gory shit and my medical record being shot forever.

The dermatologist  was very cool about it...he did not question my story, regardless of what he thought about it, and he's just not the kind of guy who's going to write in my records that I'm a drug addict.  He is slightly aspy and the opposite of nosy..he starts his day at 6am, and works straight through until 8pm, often seeing 100 patients a day.  He is the sole derma. at his practice, and he has about 5 assistants who both man the comp. and phone, and help out bandaging and shit.

He was very gentle, gave me 3 separate shots of novocaine first, saying he was doing his absolute best to numb me up.  He said that when there is an abscess, there is literally an infection surrounded by a ""wall"" of puss or some gross shit under your skin, so white blood cells can't get in and fight it.  Therefore, novocaine doesn't work as well as it usually does.  The actual draining of the abscess was still not fun at ALL, but it was a lot better than I expected.  I didn't scream out ""FUCK"" once..just a couple ""ahhhhhhhhhhhhh owwwwww"" under my breath.

I put the needle down for a good 2 weeks afterwards, but recently was called by a buddy who really wanted me to pick up for him.  On top of that, one of my dealers was jealous of my Brooklyn connects..he wanted to trade his dope with me so he could throw a couple bags to his custys to ask what they think, should he go in on a few (dozen) Bricks, since he doesn't use...and everyone was RAVING about my BK dope.  I didn't let on to this, but that particular dope was about the best stuff that guy has ever had, before or since.  UNfortunately, that dealer says he works for someone else, and will not BUDGE on his $10 a bag price-regardless if you get 5, 50, or 500. Buns are ALWAYS 100. Don't even ask. You have $483 dollars, and want a brick at least?  Too bad, he'll give you 48 bags, and you can keep the $3.  That said, my waterbury dealer was still impressed by the reviews, and worried he would lose me and all the people I help out. So he told me he would make sure his shit was 9+ from now on, and he even said for every 10 buns I get from him, I get ONE FREE. Fucking subway (eat fresh) type shit. 

Anyway, I bought 4 buns for a buddy today..for myself, since this is 10 I've gotten,  I scored a bun+2 bags today, and I hit in my hand a couple of times.  I gotta admit tho, my abscess is almost healed, and that big juicy vein is just calling out...reminding me how EASILY it just gives me blood. Then I remember the pain, the swelling, the embarrassment, the skeptical look from my dad...all dat ridiculous shit.  So, I am steering clear of it thus far.

Finally, my question...HOW LONG do I have to wait before I can shoot there?  1 month? 3 months? Never ever ever again?  Please chime in.
If you made it this far..my apologies for this being a novel, I am SUPER high on some primo dope right now, and am not even really sure what I'm talking about. But I know that abscess=steer clear, don't go above the spot or below it to shoot into the same vein. That's correct, yes?",1364711556.0

So, I've been IVing #4 ECP here and there for a while- for the most part without any complication. But I thought I'd go ahead and see what you all thought about this. Please note, I am totally aware that no one online looking at a picture can tell me what a doctor could tell me... But seeing a doctor, in my situation, takes time and money that I don't have right at the second so I figure some advice in the meantime is better than none. 

So here's the picture: http://imgur.com/oUFUu3Y

If you can't tell, it's a fairly large bruise running along the vein with a small darker spot and the vein looks fairly pale within the boundaries of the discoloration. 

I've been avoiding shooting upwards of the bruise in that vein, or in that vein in general. The bruise doesn't really hurt, but it's pretty large for something caused by a small-gauge needle and it's been there for a while. 

Anyway, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't like... Likely a sign of any kind of blood poisoning or other dangerous complications. The fact that it doesn't hurt is reassuring to me, but it makes me nervous because I know how risky IV can be. I appreciate any advice or insight you can give. 

Also, while I'm here I have a bonus question that I didn't think was worth devoting a whole thread to, but I'm curious:

On occasion I've stuck the needle in, registered, let the tourniquet loose, and then when I started to push the plunger down there would be a great deal of resistance. It felt somewhat like if the rig clogged, but I'm 95% sure that isn't the case. I'm only using heroin that dissolves clear in room-temp water and I'm filtering through cottons... But anyway, It feels like I'd have to REALLY force it to finish the injection. Naturally, I'm not about to fuck around and hurt myself. When this happens there's always a sting like when you miss, but when I miss this doesn't happen.. Not to mention that since I register in these shots I assume it's not a matter of missing. So anyway, I pull out and reregister in a different vein- and the second time it always works perfectly. Just wondering what would cause this extreme pressure/resistance against the plunger. 

Any response to either question is greatly appreciated. You guys (and girls) are the bomb.

Thanks and thanks again.",1364687906.0

I am truly lucky to never have to deal with really bad pain that required constant opiates. My grandfather is dying from lung cancer, the cancer has spread to his spine, brain and his left shoulder. He takes Oxycontin 10mg along with oxycodone 30mg instant release for his pain. These medications have allowed him to live his last few weeks pain free so far.

My grandfather lives in southern Ohio. This part of the state has been extremely effected by prescription drug abuse, so he has had a lot of trouble filling his pain medication. Also the local police are now telling families of cancer victims that after they die the police will come and confiscate their pain medications. Which is extreme horse shit in my book but they already got permission from my grandmother because she just agreed with everything they asked her to do.

These medications serve a purpose to help people like my grandfather. They are too often seen as a ""problem"" by the government and law enforcement, but they help people to pass away comfortably and help normal people with real pain issues. While I was using I forgot what these medications are actually used for, and I am extremely grateful to them for helping my grandpa be comfortable.

I posted this earlier but I deleted because I felt it was to personal but I decided it was alright to share.

My girlfriend was captain of the dance team at her high school (im a freshman in college, shes a senior in hs), and I was back home the week before her show; this made it so she couldn't hang out at all because she had rehearsal for her upcoming show from 3 to 9 every weeknight and then had homework to do after. So, I was going to sleep at her house on Friday to make up for it. I was with her until 11:30 or so, and then I made up a lie, saying I had to work with my dad the next day and had to sleep at my house to wake up in time for the early time. She was upset and mad that I just brought that news up to her, but was understanding and kind still. 

Was I working the next day? Of course not, but I had picked up earlier in the day and was fiending thinking about it the whole time I was with her. My mom, seeing me home with a friend when I was supposed to be sleeping at my girlfriends, asked why I wasn't with her. I made up bullshit about not wanting to be with the girl anymore, not feeling it, etc. etc. 

After I went through all of my shit and started to feel crappy and down a couple days later, I thought about it and realized how scummy I am. This is the one girl that I've always felt a connection with and sincerely care about, and I make it up to her by having to get high every night while I was home, including the night I was supposed to be with her. I feel like such an asshole for lying to a girl I care about, and then lying to my mom, acting like I don't care about the girl, to make an excuse just to get high.

She saw my mom today I guess and she brought up me leaving her house to work with my dad, and my mom didn't understand, and blew my cover. Opiates have made me have a rocky time with this girl a few times, but she's a straight shooter with a lot going for her so I feel weird talking to her about it. But now, knowing that I've lied to her, it just reinforces with her that I'm not worth it and that I'm a piece of shit (at least thats what I would think in her situation). Opiates are so addicting, and before even having physical withdrawals I cave in and make someone I care about a lot really upset. Being 7 hours away, it's hard to make up, and the worst feeling to me is knowing how upset I've made someone I care about, just because of my greedy desire to get high. I dunno, I'm venting, don't know what I expect to get out of this, just wanted to share. Opiates always seem to mess you up, I feel like I want to stop because I have no self control, but stopping completely seems impossible.",1364667472.0

I have thought about maybe mixing some benzos into my daily usage to take away my anxiety and to lower my usage would work.  I was hoping maybe someone here has done something to lower their daily usage that I havent thought of yet. 

I think that switching to subs for the next few weeks will probably be the best way to save money and still get a little high everyday.  So with a daily tolerance of 400mgs how much sub should I be taking everyday.  I know that no matter what subs are going to be cheaper probably cost me 60-80 dollars each day instead of 180-240 each day.

But maybe some of you remember one of my only posts back in January where I was basically bitching about not being able to find any, and my dealer (we will call him “C”) was ignoring me because he was jealous that I was talking to my ex again or some shit like that. Anywho, there has been a recent turn of events. C eventually got over his little fit he was throwing and everything went back to normal again. Lately C and I have been talking more and more and he has openly admitted that he has feelings for me.  Even though I am still waiting on things to come together with my ex and I, I kind of have been milking this because I don’t want him to get mad/upset and stop selling to me. But lately the situation with my ex feels hopeless and I feel like I should really just remove myself from the situation. Last night I was telling C about my situation and he basically said does that mean that I am ready to finally walk away from the situation with my ex and see where things go with me and him. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some feelings for him. Before my ex and I tried to mend things, C and I were kind of casually sleeping together but I didn’t allow myself to like him at that point because he constantly talked about how anti-relationships he is (another reason why I am skeptical). By this point you are probably thinking that I just slept with him for the drugs but I wasn’t even using opiates when we very first met so that’s not it. But now that I am, I feel like dating my dealer can cause major complications in my life. For example I feel like it will push me further into addiction. Also I don’t want there to be awkward scenarios where I expect him to front or give me anything, because I am still a customer. He does not use opiates, by the way. Also what if I ever decided to stop…I feel like it would be difficult to be around him because he would still be selling. And again, I do want to reinforce that I am not just doing this because of the drugs, although he is my dealer we are still pretty good friends (i.e we hang out sometimes and text all the time). I just feel so conflicted with him and the situation with my ex. Of course I would rather get back together with my ex, but if that’s not what he wants right now I can’t continue to wait any longer and should start moving on and seeing what else is out there.
